personalfinance,I just found out that my parents are financially cutting me off when the year ends. I'm almost completely dependent on them them. What can I do to become financially self-sufficient within two months?,"I am a college junior in the USA. For reasons that are probably irrelevant to this post, my parents have decided to cut all financial support off on the new year. They are trying to keep this a secret and do not know I know about their plans. They apparently plan to spring the news on me when I come to see them for my school's winter break.

Some details on my situation:

* I am almost completely dependent on them. I believe they pay for approximately 60% of my tuition and housing fees, and I am on their health/dental insurance plan. At my school tuition and housing cost approximately $28k per year. I pay for my utilities, food, clothing, what's left of my medical bills after insurance, and everything else.

* My ability to support myself is tied to my university. I live in university housing and my job is through the university. **If I lose my ability to pay for college, I will lose my job and my apartment**.

* I have three student loans: Federal Stafford Subsidized, Stafford Unsubsidized and PLUS. I do not know how much I borrow because they do not allow me access to my FAFSA records except to renew the loans for the next year (I may have also gotten the loan names wrong, again because I do not have access to that information).

* My job pays $8.50 per hour, and is limited to 10 hours per week. Though it doesn't pay well, it is something I'm very passionate about and I would be reluctant to give it up for better-paying employment.

* I am currently on their health and dental insurance. I'm uncertain if they are planning on taking me off of their plan, but it seems somewhat likely. I have three prescriptions and two doctors. Two of my prescriptions are cheap (.87 and .53 cents, respectively) but the other is more expensive ($16.27). One of my doctors (a psychiatrist) is at my student health center, another (an endocrinologist) is at a smaller clinic a few miles out of town.

* I do not have a vehicle and depend on my university transit (which is free for students, and $1.25 per ride for everyone else) or the kindness of my friends to get around. 

* My bank account is in my hometown bank, and it is held in my mother's and my name. She has total access to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds. She also may have taken about $900 from the account behind my back (but that's something I have to worry about later). My bank statement is delivered to my parents' home. I do not have access to electronic banking. 

I hope this is enough information to get some help. I can't talk to my parents about any of this for fear of exposing the person who told me the plans. If you all need more information, I'll do my best to provide it, but I may not have all access or knowledge to the information you need.",finance,1477959531
personalfinance,Why is my mortgage company sending me a stamped letter to refinance once a week (no exaggeration),"October 4th, 11th, 18th, and 25th I've gotten a stamped letter.
It actually probably goes back 2 months before that but I wasn't saving the letters from then.

Every week it's either:

- Refinance to a lower rate  
- Refinance from 15 year to 10 year


It's most certainly deterred me, as seeing that they are so desparate for me to refinance, there must be something in it for them?

I have a 3.625% interest rate atm, and as far as I understand my rate could potentially end up being higher after the refinance?  I tried calling a few months ago after the first letter to ask questions, but hung up after dealing with a poor connection and a man with a thick accent on the other end of the line

What are some ways that I can be bitten by refinancing?  I am totally down for paying more to finish paying off the loan faster.  I just feel like there's strings attached just because of the volume of spam I've received",finance,1477971091

personalfinance,(CAN) Need help in deciding whether to rent or buy a condo located in the Toronto area,"Hi PF,
My partner and I have found a new condo we like and can afford in a nice area.  It will not be ready for another year and requires a 20% down payment over the next year.  We have about 15% saved as of today and will be saving the remaining 5% over the year.

Condo details: 

Purchase price = $434,900

Condo fees = estimated to be about $350/month for the first year

Deposits: 

5% now = 21,745

5% in 120 days = 21,745

5% on occupancy = 21,745

5% on registration = 21,745

Mortgage balance = 347,920

Interest rate 2.49%, 5 year fixed, 30 year amortization = $630.58 biweekly

Closing fees = estimated $10,000

We can rent a similar place for about $1,800.  We plan to be in the condo for the next 5/6 years.  Does it make sense for us to purchase it in this case?  We can just about afford this purchase (down payment wise) but our monthly income will allow to to comfortably afford the monthly payment (mortgage or rent) as well as the living expenses outside of the ones I listed that will come with either owning or renting.

We are trying to make a financially wise decision.  Most people we speak to say we should purchase a place if we can as it is a good investment and allows us to get into the market, however most of the stuff we read online leans towards renting and investing that money in something else.  We are really overwhelmed with so much conflicting information and would just like some advice on the financial perspective of both options.

Thank you and let me know if I should provide any additional information.

personalfinance,"Have student loans, net income less than payments","Hi everyone!

I'm pretty financially savvy so a friend asked me for advice on how to handle his student loans. This is an area I don't know that much about so I'm hoping to at least pass on some questions or ideas. 

My friend is carrying a large balance of federal student debt ($100k+) on his masters degree. He could not find a well paying job in his field after graduation and after all expenses, there's really not enough to make regular monthly payments. He is currently forbearance but the interest in accumulating, which is problematic too. 

Other than looking for a higher paying job, are there any other helfpul options to look at? I honestly don't know what else there is... 

Note on expenses - I don't think that my friend is managing his expenses as best as he can (e.g. goes out to eat quiet a bit), and this is something I've mentioned everytime this topic comes up. I don't think it's helping the situation, at the same time, if your monthly payment is $1,000k+, saving an addition $100 or $200 per month by making your own coffee or lunch isn't really going to put a big dent in the payment amount.",finance,1478013695

personalfinance,Advice on Employer overpayment,"Good morning PF, 

I am seeking some advice as I do not know if this is correct. Due to Hurricane Matthew, my fiance's employer paid Disaster pay. They did not properly input 8 hours and gave her 40 hours worth of pay. This overpayment made her deductions shoot up to the $600 that was given (gross was 1600, taxes and deducts brought back to $1000). Student loan payment took a higher percentage, Fed and SS were higher along with 401k. 

Now, with the repayment of the overages, they are just deducting $480. There is no compensation for the higher taxes she paid on the $600. 

Am I wrong in assuming there should be a reduction on the amount given back due to taxes and deductions? 

This blanket $480 just feels wrong.

personalfinance,Idiot seeks advice: 30 year old vows to set up 'financial plan'.,"Hello r/personalfinance.

I will try and be brief. I've been a financial moron for a very long time. The whole of my 30 years, in fact. That said, there are areas of life in which I believe I have shown tremendous promise. Examples include things like licking egg beaters perfectly clean [REMOVE THEM FROM THE MIXING DEVICE, TRUST ME ON THIS ONE].

I come to you having read the guides pertinent to me: (15-20, 18-25, 25-35) 

I will attempt to summarize my financial situation now, so I may pose my questions. I spent the first 5 years of adult life (18-23) working. I spent 24-28 in college, working part-time and gathering debts. I have spent 28-30 paying off those debts on my modest income.

I am currently making $51,000 a year. I am $60,000 in debt to the federal government for my student loans. I am currently participating in the income-based payment plan, and pay $188.00 per month on said loans. I had a tremendous cloud of credit card debt and bad decisions floating over my head after college, but I have, as of this very moment, payed ALL debt (aside from my college loans) down to 0. I have a few collections on my credit history (Dish Network isn't my biggest fan) but I have 0'd them all as well. I checked my credit and I am sitting somewhere between a 660-680. Also worth noting: I am paying 5% of my checks into a 401k, my company does not match or do ANYTHING to add to that, and it is not accruing money very quickly, but I've got about $1,000 in it so far. I have no intention of touching this money, and I intend to keep putting 5% in until I don't get paychecks anymore.

I am a single man. I have a reliable and fully payed off vehicle, I have no girlfriend, no plans for buying a house, and no plans for starting a family as of yet. 

Here's where my questions come in. I've never been in this situation before. I have been living paycheck to paycheck, spending all of my extra cash to reduce my debt cloud, for the last 3 years. Now I find myself in this place where I have no debt excluding federal college loans, no major needs, and no idea what to do with the surplus. In a basic budget analysis, I estimate that I will have approximately 400-500 extra dollars a month.

----------

Question 1: What is the most intelligent way to invest that money? It's not a lot, but I'd like to use it for growth. What options do I have, considering that I don't want to buy a house?

----------

Question 2: Is 5% with no matching enough to be putting into my 401k at this point? Should I be putting more into my 401k at this point in my life? I anticipate that I will be changing jobs fairly soon, so I'm a little leary to really start dumping into this fund since the process of transferring it to my next employer is a little hazy and intimidating to me.

----------

Question 3: Given my history, credit cards scare me. I haven't used one in over 5 years. That being said, I know 660 isn't a good credit score. What steps do I take to improve that, aside from what I've done already in closing collections and 0'ing out my debts. That was step one, now what's step 2?

----------

Question 4: Since I don't have any open credit cards and I have 0 savings, I live in vulnerability. If my truck breaks down, for example, I have no means to repair it. I have been lucky to not run into any disasters up to this point, but I am now considering throwing all this money into a savings account over time to amass a safety net type nest egg. How big should that nest egg be? Is that a bad idea? Are there better ways to protect myself in this manner?

----------

Question 5: I am on the income-based payment options for my student loans. From what I understood in the verbiage of the loans, this gives me a payment option that I can afford, but I'm still accruing interest on the total amount. The current rate of repayment, I would not come anywhere NEAR paying this off in 20 years, and as I understood it, as long as I make 20 years of payments, regardless of how much I have payed off, the loans will disappear. If I go to basic minimum payments, it will shoot my payment up to 660 dollars a month, eating the entirety of my surplus. Is this what I should be doing? Or should I remain on the income based plan? Am I naive to believe that after 20 years of paying less per month, they will eat the remaining debt? 

Thanks in advance, any kind soul who reads this and attempts to help me. I'll just be over here, trying to remove my tongue from the mixer.",finance,1478018771
personalfinance,Advice paying off credit card debt?,"[My Debt](http://i.imgur.com/lqKXv1R.jpg)

Hi all, thanks for clicking. Credit scores are anywhere from 640 (Credit Karma) to 714 (Discover FICO score).

In the above image I listed my current balances and interest rates for all of my lines of credit. I have always browsed /r/personalfinance and this year has been a much drastic one to the year prior in a very positive way:

* ex-gf from posts in the past has been long gone for over a year now
* new girlfriend living with me contributes monthly to expenses
* I have a roommate that does the same

So considering where I was a year ago Nov. 2015, I'm doing much better. However,

I've gauged the pros and cons of the avalanche/snowball effect and I think sticking with the snowball method helps me more in the short term. As you can see from the image, I have 2 credit cards that have been paid off and I will no longer be using. I am currently on track to pay off my **Citi - Thank You** balance in full in the next 2 weeks. After that, I will be focusing on the Amazon debt.

My question is this: *is there anything else I can be doing (consolidating, lowering int. rates, paying towards a different balance) that will in the long run help me more?* I do not really understand APR calculations, but I feel like paying down the smaller debts first saves me in minimum payments more than it does in higher interest charges.

**EDIT: I plan on calling each card company and using the script located here [negotiating your rate](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/script-negotiate-better-credit-card-deal-1267.php) but I just haven't gotten around to it yet, but I'm not sure if a lower APR will apply to existing balances or only to new purchases.**",finance,1478018797

I never took care to understand anything about my loans while making any decisions.  My original loan was from a 2 year Tech School in 2001 and I consolidated in 2006.

Where I stand right now (approx values starting from 2006):
Original Principal Amount $ 36,307.80
Current Principal Balance $ 35,600

Total Principal Paid $ 4,760
Total Interest Paid $ 22,700

Type: 2 Federal Consolidated FFELP (1 Subsidized and 1 Unsubsidized)

In 15 years I've barely put a dent in my loan because I concentrated on paying off my other Student Private Loan first.  My interest alone is $340 a month, so not a lot is going to principal.  I would try to pay more, but I'm the sole provider for a single income family with a baby, plus the cost of living in California is high.  If I can lower my interest somehow I can make more of a dent in principal.

Is 7.25% APR considered high and if so what are my options?  Can I refinance a Federal Consolidated Loan, or get another lower APR loan to pay off this loan, or any method to help out?

personalfinance,Small defined benefit pension or roll to an IRA?,"Looking for opinions on what could be best in my situation. I had 8 years into a state retirement plan that was 25 years to retire, 4 to be vested. Plan pays 2% of high 4 average per year of service upon retirement. If you leave like I did but still have your money stay in the system, they will pay that 16% of average $40k starting at 65 (my stats plugged in)

Cash value I had about 30k in the system that could be rolled into an IRA or into my TSP for that matter since I now work for the federal government.  I see the potential for a lot of growth should I do this. Plus it would really give me a head start on growth by making that large lump sum if I went the TSP route. Right now I have about 11k in that account. 

I am unsure if I will ever go back to the state after retiring from the Feds. I'm in my dream job now so little chance of leaving here unless they make me. If by some chance I did go back to the state after retiring, I would pick up in the old system where I left off granting I had left the funds alone. If I withdraw them, I will start over under the new system which is 30 to retire and 8 vested.

1. The refinancing would help lower the monthly payment, does it make sense to go back to a 30 year plan but pay extra on the monthly payments?

personalfinance,"Need to cash some, but not all, of my savings bonds; how do I decide which to redeem?","Hey guys,

I'm currently 25 years old, and am looking into cashing a few bonds I have in order to invest in some ETFs.  The current value of the bonds totals around $9,000, and I'd like to redeem somewhere around $2,000.  I invested in the S&amp;P about 6 years ago, and these ETF shares have outpaced my bonds dramatically.  Now, I know this does not mean I will continue to make money, but since I am young, I would like to expose myself to a little more risk.

My problem is that cashing these bonds is less straight forward than I expected.  I thought that I would just redeem the ones with the lowest interest rate, but as I do more research, I am finding that it is more complicated than this.  I have 7 Series I bonds, and 11 Series EE bonds, and am still a bit confused about how these work.  One of the major advantages of I bonds seems to be how one can pay for a child's higher education with them without paying taxes.

personalfinance,We need help deciding whether or not to sell my husband's car!,"I've read the wiki and searched for online calculators but I'm having trouble figuring this out.

Long story short, we just moved across the country and now my husband works from home. We live in a really walkable area in a trendy neighborhood and there are lots of bars/restaurants/convenience stores/grocery stores within a 1mi radius. We are rarely in a position where we both need to drive to separate places at the same time (I work 3 nights/week) and usually it's when I'm at work in the evening and he takes our dog to the dog park or goes grocery shopping or something. 
I'm trying to convince him that it'd be better to sell his car and put the money towards the principal on my loan, and use the money we save on insurance towards my monthly payments and he told me he needs a pretty convincing argument to do so. He loves his car and he bought it with none of my input and I bought my car without any of his (he doesn't like driving mine) as we weren't married at the time. We also do not pay extra for parking.

Now for the details:  I have a 2012 Toyota Yaris SE with 26k miles (bought with 13k miles). The original price when all was said and done was $21,185. I put $2k down to bring my loan amount down to $19,185. I have a 3.5% interest rate and a 72mo lease bringing my monthly payments to $317.17. I have overpaid a few times so the payoff amount is $14,025.

His car is a 2002 Acura TL bought for $5k in Spring 2015. It has 136k mi on it and still runs pretty well. If we sell it, I'm hoping to get $3k as it's still in pretty good shape. If we sold his car and put that $3000 towards my principle and then added an additional $100 from the extra car insurance towards my regular monthly payment, would it be worth the inconvenience to sell his car or would the difference be negligible and come down to preference?

Side note, I'm also wondering if I should be making all of my regular monthly payments towards the principle or if it doesn't matter? I can't do principle-only payments online so I haven't been doing them, but will it make a difference?

I realize now that I should have saved more for the downpayment on my car or bought a cheaper one but I can easily afford the payments so I'm not too interested in selling mine....unless you can provide a REALLY good argument!

personalfinance,How can you remove a charge-off on an account that was previously paid,"Hey personal finance! 

Long time lurker, first time poster here. 

I have been rebuilding my credit slowly but surely after some early years of bad financial decisions. I have been saving money and paying off old debts over the past few years. 

Today I attempted to get a student loan refinance on several federal student loans. I was denied by the bank due to a charge off on my Equifax report. I had originally thought that the charge off was from my former college from a Perkins loan that had yet to be paid. At least that's what Credit Karma had listed. 

Unfortunately, when I requested my free credit report from Equifax, it had 2 accounts listed as charge offs from old credit cards. It didn't even have my loan listed as a charge off. 

I know that you can attempt to get a charge off removed by agreeing to a payment plan as long as you get it in writing, but the problem is that the accounts listed as charge offs have already been negotiated and paid. I had an old account through GE money bank (Walmart credit card) that I arranged a settlement and repayment plan through a collection agency. It has since been paid and the account through that collection agency lists it as ""Paid collections"" and ""paid for less than full balance"". The original account with GE Money Bank is still listed as a charge off. 

The second account that is listed as a charge off is from Capital One. This account was settled directly with Capital One and is now listed as ""Account closed at consumers request,
Account paid for less than full balance"". Unfortunately it's still listed as a charge off. 

My question is, how do I get the charge off removed from an account that has already been paid and closed? It seems like I now have no negotiating power to have it removed. Is there some other way to negotiate a removal? The funny thing is that although it's listed as a charge off through Capital One, I have two credit cards currently with them with a $3000 credit limit between the two. 

I had hopes of returning to school this spring or next fall in order to complete my degree, but there is no way that I am going to be able to get any more student loans with charge offs on my credit report. I was already denied for a refinance so I know I can't get a separate individual loan.

The mods at r/bitcoin tried to punish the users by mass approving a bunch of stories and then stopping moderating, the reason there was a bunch of stories in the first place was because there was huge news which disappeared (censored) and people kept resubmitting it because they couldn't fathom that the mods would be *censoring* something like that. 

Then the mods like /u/bashco tried to say everyone with an opinion that was different was a sock-puppet (none of us are real, didn't you know?) and banned most the early adopters and long time users.

*then* they began censoring all mention of censorship, as well continue to delete comments they didn't agree with and ban users who tried to point out lies or correct false statements

The end result is a *highly* skewed spin on reality, but as new people go to bitcoin they are fed an endless stream of propagada reinforced by a set of sockpuppets and other people who simple have never heard the truth.


Really though, if you need censorship because your ideas can't stand on their own versus other ideas then you are on the wrong 'side'

personalfinance,Buying a house below my means that I don't plan to stay in longer than a few years. Does a 5/1 ARM make more sense than a 30yr fixed?,"Afternoon PF!

I have been renting very cheaply for the last few years to help save up and pay down some student loans a well as start to save for an eventual house. I am at the point now where I would like to buy and I feel my financial situation is stable enough to do so. Here is my financial situation. I have always and will always try to live below my means, so I went with a house that fits my lifestyle a bit better.

* House Price: $84,000
* Income: $90,000
* Retirement: 166% match on first 6% 401k, 70k total. Full matched amount contributed each month.
* Student Loans: $60k, all under 4% (weighted average 3.3%). I started with 120k roughly 4 years ago and have been aggressively paying it down to get rid of some of my 6+% loans. Currently snowballing ~3k/month, but will likely adjust budget after house purchase.
* Assets: 16k in savings (another 5k in emergency fund). 
* Assets(2): 7k in Roth IRA rolled over from an old 401k. I forgot about this old 401k for the longest time, and only recently rolled it over with the thought of maybe using it as a first time home buyer down payment (which avoids the early pull-out fee).
* Credit score: 691. I thought this was higher, but apparently its not as nice as the 762 that my credit karma tells me.

I have already decided to buy the house, as I am fine paying the extra per month from what I'm paying now for the extra garage space and general freedom for projects and/or renovations. What I am debating on however, is what loan option to pursue. I would like to minimize the amount I put down for the house so I can have more funds available for things like furniture or paying down my student loans, while absolutely avoiding PMI. Here are the options I am looking at right now, both through my credit union.


* Two 5/1 ARM loans, both 3% for 85% and 15% of the house value, with 5% down. While I dont want to count on not being in the house within the next 5 years, this is attractive to me due to the lower overall payment, avoiding PMI, and being at a lower interest rate. My plan would be sell the house or refinance if I decided to stay more than 5 years (which is unlikely--but again, I dont want to make that assumption as if its fact). Any excess saved money would be put towards either the house or my student loans, whichever has the higher interest rate.

* Two 30yr fixed mortgages. One for 80% of the house @4.25% and one for 15% of the house cost @4.72% with 5% down. The idea behind the two mortgages is to avoid PMI--which I absolutely do not want to pay.

personalfinance,"My car is part of the Volkswagen emissions scandal. Should I sell my car to pay off debt (and have a lower interest car loan), or just take the reparation money?","I own outright (I have the title) a 2012 VW Passat with 114,000 miles. Due to my car being part of the scandal, I get $5,200 cash for reparations no matter what I choose. 

My choice is whether to sell the car, or keep it and have VW correct the emissions problem for free. 
VW would buy back the car at the Blue Book rate prior to the scandal, which would come out to $11,600. 

So if I sold the car, I would get $16,800 total (car sale plus reparation). If I keep the car and have them fix it, I would get $5200. 

I have $35,000 in credit card debt, $22,000 of which is 8.15% interest, $13,000 is 0% until February 2017 due to a promotional balance transfer rate. I'm already budgeting and progressively paying these off. 

If I buy a cheap used car, I believe the car loan interest rate would be much less than the credit card interest rate.  I still have a decent credit score. I could use the money from the car sale/reparation to pay off most of the $22,000 at 8.15%.

financialindependence,What would you change in our situation?,"Throwaway. I discovered this sub about three months ago and have been visiting regularly since. I've read a few relevant books (Your Money or Your Life, The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need, and The Millionaire Next Door) but I would love the good people of /FI to take a look at our situation and let me know what we should change.

&amp;nbsp;
**OVERVIEW:**

Recently married couple, ages 28 and 31. US citizen (me) and UK citizen (him). Living in a big city in Texas-- medium/high COL area. No kids, no plans to have kids. Both healthy right now. (Knock on wood.)

&amp;nbsp;
**INCOME:**

Our joint income, before taxes, is around $200,000. I'm self-employed as of last year, so my income is variable but averages out around $95K. He works for an engineering company and just got a raise to $103K.

&amp;nbsp;
After taxes this year, I will bring home about $77,285 and he will bring home about $74,000. Combined: $151,285.

&amp;nbsp;
**EXPENSES:**

I'm the frugal one. He's less so-- not a wasteful spender by American standards, but he likes nice things and doesn't like budgeting. Our biggest unnecessary expenses are travel, house improvements, and entertainment. I'm not looking to massively cut our expenditures, otherwise I would share our itemized budget, but I want feedback regarding what to do with our extra earnings.

&amp;nbsp;
We spend about $75,750 each year. Thus, our savings rate is approximately 50%.

&amp;nbsp;
**DEBTS:**

No student loan debt (made the final payment this year!). No credit card debt. Both our cars are paid off. 

&amp;nbsp;
**PROPERTIES:**

We bought a small house in a great area last year for $375,000 and we still have $292,000 on our mortgage. Our loan has a 4% interest rate. The house was built in 1946 and required a fair amount of repairs/upkeep. Since we moved in, we have spent around $16,000 on the house. We don't have any major repairs left, and the property values in our city continue to skyrocket. 

&amp;nbsp;
We also own a house in the United Kingdom, purchased in 2012 for £240,000 with £137,226 still on the mortgage. The interest rate is 5.125% but we'll be refinancing next year. My husband bought it before he found out he was moving here. Currently we have renters in the house. It's not a source of income, as the rent just covers mortgage + occasional repairs + property manager fee, but it's an asset worth mentioning. 

&amp;nbsp;
**BALANCES:**

We pool all of our money. We didn't get a pre-nup either, because we like to live dangerously.

&amp;nbsp;

Joint checking account: $12,209

Emergency fund: $30,000 (~6 months of expenses)

My 401K from my last job: $26,831

My SEP IRA: $33,250

His 401K: $28,014

His UK retirement savings: £16,000

UK bank account: £4,290.51

&amp;nbsp;
**MOVING FORWARD:**

We both enjoy our jobs and don't plan to quit anytime soon. I would like to achieve financial independence sooner than 65, however, simply for the peace of mind. I don't yet have a target date, but right now I'm thinking when I turn 50. 

&amp;nbsp;
Our plan is as follows-- I will allot 30% of my earnings for taxes and 25% for my SEP IRA (that's the maximum). He will increase his 401(k) contribution to $18,000 (plus, his company now does a 50% match up to 8% of salary). He will also put 15% of his salary into the employee stock purchase plan.

&amp;nbsp;
**QUESTIONS:**

1. What should we do with the money that's left after maxing out both of our retirement accounts? I'm thinking of opening a Vanguard index fund account. (I like the ""Core Four"" plan-- Bond Market Index Fund, Stock Market Index Fund, International Stock Index Fund, and REIT Index Fund. Minimum buy-in for each fund is $3,000, so we could use the money sitting in our checking account.) 
&amp;nbsp;
2. I'm thinking of rolling over my old company 401K into a new IRA, as I checked the current fees and they are too high for my tastes. However, it's been over a year since I left my company. Will the delay pose a problem? Also, I'm open to IRA suggestions. I'm currently with Charles Schwab.
&amp;nbsp;
3. Can you think of any ways we can take advantage of the low UK pound to US dollar conversion rate?
&amp;nbsp;
4. Any other glaring issues or areas of opportunity?

&amp;nbsp;
Thanks in advance.",finance,1478041840
personalfinance,How do you know when it's appropriate to rent out a house vs. sell it?,"Here's the skinny. We are moving out of state because my spouse got a much higher paying job. We owe about $200k on a $350k house (this is what we bought it for 4 years ago) with a 3.5% interest rate. 

Our total monthly payment comes to about $1,200/month. Zillow estimates that we could rent it out for about $2,000/month (I know Zillow is hit or miss on accuracy, just a data point). A house on our block that is the same size and layout is currently rented out for $1,800/month. 

It's a hot market and we could probably easily sell the house. 

However, we're moving to a very expensive area and far away from family. We don't necessarily want to sell in case we want to come back. 

We can afford to pay the mortgage + rent even if we have no tenants (my spouse earns about $120k/yr, I earn about $70k/yr). We're definitely comfortable; we max out our retirement accounts and HSA. We have no debt besides the house.

Random assortment of things we've considered:

* If we sell the house, we will no longer be able to take the mortgage interest deduction and would likely go to a standard deduction
* Overall, it's going to complicate our taxes by a lot having to fill out a Schedule C
* We'll have to have a property management company since we'll be far away so they'll take ~10% of the rent
* We can't afford to buy in our new area for at least 2 years even if we manage to sell the house and save 100% of my salary
* Tenants can be assholes

I'd love to hear some of your thoughts on the situation.",finance,1478041910
personalfinance,Okay PF I would really appreciate some insight/advice into my car buying journey i am about to begin.,"Okay so long story short, Im 31 and have bad credit (about 540) because of being irresponsible for many years.  But I recently decided to make major life changes and have moved back with my mother, got a very stable job (making approx 40-45 k).  I have been working for a little over 2 months now and because of only really having a phone bill and helping my mom with some bills I have been able to save 2 thousand dollars.  My goal is to save for one more month and have 3 thousand to put towards a car.  I dont want to buy a beater and just have problems with it.  Also I would like to have payments to help my credit out.  So, should I look into a used car in the 5-8 thousand dollar range and put about half down? Try to get a new car (if i can) and i assume my interest rate would be very high but it would be a new car? Or lease something?  I don't even know my chances at getting accepted for a loan or what my best option is, that's why i'm coming to you guys.  Oh yeah I currently dont have my own car I have been using my moms which is great but I have no trade in value, just cash.  AND i wont ask her to co=sign this is something I have to do myself.

Without derailing too much, if you google ""More proof Jesus existed than Julius Caesar"", you'll find a good 3 million hits, yet it is just readily accepted by some churchgoers. I feel that the circular logic around here seems to stem largely out of this fear of missing out


1. '*Past performance is not indicative of future results*', your quintessential RDS, yet it seems to get read like; ""if nobody can predict the future, then anyone who tries is an idiot who will lose all their money', I mean, how do you suppose professionals evaluate companies without historical financial data?

3. '*Time in the market beats timing the market*', what does that *even mean*? Does that mean you don't reduce your exposure to risky assets like tech or financial stocks before the Brexit referendum, or any other macro/event risks like PMI, FOMC announcements/decisions? Because ou hold the entire index now you're now **fully diversified**, and anyone who isn't is on their way to financial ruin


4. '[Active fund managers are so stupid even monkeys could beat them](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/monkeys-are-better-stock-pickers-than-fund-managers-experiment-2013-4)'. Does it make the headlines when monkeys fail to beat the benchmark?

Meanwhile, I have $30k in a vested State retirement plan that would pay an annuity of about $750/month once I hit the age of 65. It earns about 2% interest a year, but it's a defined benefit plan so if I leave the money there the interest (if I'm understanding this right) doesn't mean anything since I can't get any money out until age 65 and then it's a set amount irrespective of how much is in the ""account."" 


It is possible, but unlikely, that I could work for the same state again in my life.


I feel like it might be more beneficial to roll the $30k into a Vanguard or similar retirement account, if at least to have more control over it, but I don't actually understand how to compare the two options to figure out which is better. I got as far as determining that the $30k, if invested at a return of 5% annually with no additional contributions, would turn into about $92k in 23 more years... but I couldn't figure out how to compare that to the $750/mo. 


So, my question is, how do I decide which way is more advantageous? Thanks!

I dropped outof HS, got a job making $10-$11 bucks an hour and supported her and our child while she finished school. I thought I would always be at that income level because that's all the more anyone I knew made growing up. Well...you can't really raise a family on that much money so utilities constantly went past due, we'd have to move letting the utilities go to collections, tooth decay set in medical bills went ignored.....

Then BAM got a job that payed nearly 70k a year when I was 20 y/o, I worked 24/7 for it and lost it after 6 MO as the industry moved. I squandered nearly all of it, on top of that I got a car that was $700/MO (dodge nitro stock) it got repoed in 2010-11 while I was on unemployment job searching. 

Then a few year's ago I climbed into management, got a nice raise where we could keep all our bills paid and that was very nice. Now a few promotions later and a company switch I'm at 60k a year. I went back and got my GED just to have it a few month's ago....but anyway...

The good: no credit card debt because I never qualified for one.
My expenses are still only around $30-40 a year. 

The bad. Credit score is 550. Repoed car on it for 5k. I have a car loan now that'll be payed off in a year and a half with a huge interest rate. I mean huge 18% or something stupid. 
Medical bills have to total about 3-5k between hospitals and dentists. 
Other dumb things like collections accounts for utilities and cell phone bills are about 2k. 

That's it. Never been to college so no loans there. 
How long do you think it would take me to build my credit up enough to seriously consider buying a house? (Because that would be a dream) and where do I start, should I even care about the old repoed car considering it'll fall off in a year?

Luckily, my situation is not as bad as some.  I have a master's degree, and my loans are all federal, no private loans at all.  I graduated in 2009, and at that point, I had around $45,000 in loans total from both my undergraduate and master's degree.

I wasn't making a lot of money at the time, so I got on a graduated payment plan.  This is a plan where you start off paying smaller amounts, and that grows over time.  This was very helpful for me back then, but since then I've gotten better jobs, and I never changed the payment plan.  *DONT DO THIS* Get off the graduated payment plan as soon as you can.  They fuck you over with regards to interest.  Here's how.

In the last four years, I've been paying every payment on time.  I was owing about $232 per month, but I thought I would be smart and pay $250, because I would start paying my principal down faster, right? Sometimes I would pay even more, as much as $500.  Since 2012 I have paid $12,331.  How much of that do you think went to principal and how much to interest?  Take a moment and think what you would expect before reading on.

No, those aren't typos.  Over 85% of the money I've paid in has gone to interest.  There was a five month stretch in 2014 where NO money at all went to principal, and many months it was less than $35.  My remaining principal is around $43,000.  It really makes me sick to my stomach. Now, though, I'm on a regular repayment plan, so the difference is more like 50-50% from principal and interest.  I haven't been on it enough to know if over-payments will be applied correctly.

So why does this happen?  Well, for my interest rate (5.875%), Daily interest is about $7.  Multiply that by 30 and you get $210/month just in interest costs.  And that's if you pay exactly 30 days apart, which I was not.  I paid basically whenever I felt like it, but before the due date.  Looking at the data, it was as much as 55 days apart!  That would be $385!  No wonder my measly payments of $250 were not doing anything, even though they were above the minimum payment.

So I still feel really sick that I've been so stupid about this, but at least I understand now, and maybe I can help some of you avoid making the same mistakes.  I see to key lessons:

1) Do not stay on the graduated payment plan any longer than absolutely necessary.
2) Pay on a regular schedule.  My 55 days between payments was what prompted the five months of catching up on interest.  

I haven't done the math to see how much I would have made a difference if I had been smarter even just about lesson (2).  I'm not sure I want to know the answer at this point, but at least moving forward I'm going to do better.",finance,1478062462

personalfinance,Dutch student loan interest going to 0%,"Hi PF, first top level post here.

Dutch student loan interest rates have been pretty low for the past few years (the rates are determined annually, but after graduating you get them for 5 years fixed): I've been paying 1,39% and am up for new rates in 2017. As the rates are based on the rate the state can lend at (very low if not negative) it's more than likely the new rate will be 0%

What would you do with a 5 year interest free period on your student loans? I can and have been easily affording the minimum monthly amount (about $200 on a $28K balance). The options are to:

1) keep paying the minimum amount, which will probably drop to something like 160 due to a lack of interest

2) (always an option) pay it down as fast as possible

3) Use a repayment freeze to postpone repayment


Background to option 3: In the dutch student loan system everyone has 60 months they can allocate at will during the repayment period to delay payment. Interest will continue to accrue and the repayment term is stretched by the same number of months it's delayed by.

I'm currently using 10 of these months to accelerate saving into a emergency fund + job security buffer (basically cash to make me feel comfortable job hunting/considering going freelance). I'd like to keep at least 24 months of this in reserve for actual emergencies.

Freezing repayment whilst the loan is at 0% frees up money to save/do anything profitable with. In theory even saving it up at abysmal interest and repaying later will be worthwhile (if only at a return of &lt;1%). Bugbear here is suddenly deciding that 'super duper holiday' is suddenly a valid way to spend it instead. I'm not super prone to such lapses in faith, but am slightly susceptible from moving goalposts and lifestyle creep.

Anyway, I'm probably going to at least put in the minimum payment since it's a relatively small amount anyway but move it to the bottom list of repayment priority. I don't feel my personal situation is too interesting in this regard, but how to deal with a (temporarily) 0% interest loan might be worthy of some discussion.",finance,1478082686

personalfinance,I add the numbers up but they don't come out in my favor. Please help with options.,"Hi there. I'm starting to freak out about my finances and I need advice. I'm 22 and I just recently graduated college 5 months ago. I got a job right away and I make 25k as a salaried employee. I have the opportunity to make commission, but the projects I have are sporadic and I only get paid when my project happens, so there are times when might not see commission money for 2-3 months. 

I only live by myself in an apartment that is admittedly too expensive. I also just got my loan repayment plan in the mail, and that is the kicker. I took out all private loans. I borrowed about 80k, and my fixed interest rate is 7.6% which seems too high to me. Either way, they want me to pay 900 dollars a month. I can afford that with my job. I make roughly 1,500 dollars a month without commission. If I do well, I can potentially make 2,500-3,500 a month, which would make all my problems go away. But for right now I'm making the the least possible. 

Let me give you the breakdown:

900/month loan repayment (starts December)
700/month rent
62/month for internet &amp; basic cable
40-70/month for power (rates vary)
54/month for car insurance

On top of that there are things like putting gas in my car, buying groceries, etc. Luckily enough my dad still pays my phone bill until my income increases and I can stay on his health insurance until I'm 26. So that is a bonus. I also just went through a whole thing with my car that ended costing me 3,500 dollars, so that did a real number on my savings. 

Adding it all up, my total expenses are around 925 a month, without the loan payments. 

With the loan payments it is 1,825 a month. 

I only make around 1,400 a month on my base salary, so as you can see there is a disconnect there. It also sucks because I get paid bi-weekly and then commission once a month. So it is hard to not eat away at my savings while I'm waiting for checks from work. 

What do you think I can do?",finance,1478101732

personalfinance,Make sense to make extra payments?,"Hi all,

Warning, math is not my forte.

Just bought our first house and were not able to hit 20% down (I think we put around 8% down on 445k to get to a loan amount of 417k).  We are paying around $150 monthly in PMI for the next eight years if we make scheduled payments.  Interest rate is 3.5%.

I'm wondering if it makes sense to make extra payments toward equity (e.g. $200 extra a month, or an extra full payment a year).  I've heard it's not very likely for people to stay in their first house a long time, and I have no idea what our plan is beyond hunkering down and getting at least 2-3 years at our current jobs, but no thoughts on leaving the area for any reason.

We can afford to do some extra and still live comfortably, double income no kids (kids in 3-5 year plan), but I'm wondering if we'll essentially just have paid more than necessary if we go to sell it before we even catch up to 20% equity and drop PMI.  Hopefully the market stays stable and we get any equity back if we end up selling (market has been insanely hot here), but would it make more sense to use that extra in the immediate term to make updates to the place or put into savings?  Or would these extra payments be enough to substantially lower the overall interest paid?

We do have a six month emergency fund, and are paying into HSAs and retirement.  Any other info that would be useful to consider?

The general strategy being          
&gt;Short US/DM equity           
&gt;Long US treasuries        
&gt;Long hard assets: gold miners and farm land

Additionally        

&gt;Short/Avoid Indexes    
&gt;Long specific stocks     
&gt;Long active management (timing and position sizing)     

There has been no movement of capital (distribution or contribution) since last month. I have switched methodology to reporting at month end.

Performance has been achieved maintaining a 35-45% position in U.S. Treasuries and Cash. Current positioning is 90%/40% long/short and 50% cash      

&gt;**Performance:** May: -2.2%, June: 12.4%, July:8.1%, August: -7.6%, September: 2.6%, October: -2.3% Since Start: 12.2% as of November 2        
&gt;**Benchmark (SPY+dividend)** May: 1.4%, June 0.6%, July 3.1%, August: -0.4%, September: -0.5%, October: -2.7% Since Start: 2.6% as of November 2               

Current 1 month performance is (2.3%), primarily driven by volatility of gold prices. I apologize for the lack of any update last month as I was getting married and had to do a lot of traveling for work as well. As a result I haven't had much time to think too deeply about allocation or new research ideas. The only changes have been a slight scaling down of the gold miner positions, a slight increase in the Nintendo position, and a shift of the u.s. treasury position into cash. 

Macroeconomic outlook: I continue to be very skeptical of sustained rate hike in the U.S. The fed will probably do a one and done in December because of market expectation. However, with the rest of the world lowering rates, there is little the fed can do against a tide of money that will wash in. The biggest risks today still centers around the banking systems of Europe, Japan and China. The French election in May will likely spark investor fear in a frexit, as the National Front Party will likely make significant headway. China's capital outflow continue to accelerate in the second half of 2016. The total bank assets for the country is at around USD35 trillion, and is growing by around USD5 trillion a year, compared to a US banking system of around USD15 trillion growing at a marginal rate. The sustainability of the system is suspect at best but it is hard to time the breaking point despite already rising defaults and troubled workouts. My guess is they have 2-3 years of reserves at best to paper over the leak of capital outflow. 

**GDX/GDXJ:** I continue to be very bullish on gold miners although I have temporarily scaled down some positions ahead of a expected fed hike in December. However a crisis emerging out of China or Europe will likely create a very strong dollar. Investors have been trained to think that a rising dollar means flat or falling gold prices, I think that negative correlation will break at some point. The supply inelasticity of gold means that a flight to safety crisis in China that is constrained by capital control could send gold much higher than the corresponding rise in dollars.  
  
**IEF:** The prospect of a rate hike in December plus a potential rise in inflation in the U.S make holding long duration bonds temporarily unattractive. I have shifted the full position to cash and will tactically re-enter the market after the election settles and there is more clarity. The cash is acting as the hedge in the portfolio against a China/European/Japanese based shock, it is also one of the most hated assets in the world. It is hated so much most of my networth is allocated to it (outside this test portfolio).

* Debt #1: $108k in student loan debt with 8 years of payments remaining (about $1325/month) from original private lender. 
* Debt #2: $199k in student loan debt, currently in repayment and in year 4 of 10 for PSLF. Federal loans. (from Medical School)
* Debt #3: $19k auto loan at 0.99% 
* Debt #4: $9k credit card debt at 0%
* Total monthly liabilities (including household budget): $5950/m

Income:

* Current household income is $126k pre-tax. (~6800/m take home)

After paying all bills, we're left with about $850/m extra. We've been using all of those funds to pay off the credit card debt and get it to zero ASAP. We don't have an appreciable emergency fund and haven't saved for any long term life goals as we focus on our debt. 

My spouse has completed medical residency and has entered a fellowship program. Currently, they make about $60k with a few opportunities to moonlight here and there. In 2.5 years, their salary will increase to $220k with additional opportunities for moonlighting.

Our plan has always been to immediately pay off Debt #1 (the $108k student loan) with every penny we can muster as our household income potentially reaches ~$280k, out of fellowship.

We recently were offered a refinancing ""deal"" on the private student loan by giving a slightly lower interest rate than we have now and pushing the term out to 20 years - effectively lowering the monthly payment to about $800. No fees, both in origination or with pre-payment. We thought about how if our goal is pay this loan off with all of our additional income beginning 30 months from now, would it make sense to take the refinance and use those savings to pay off debt in the near term?

finance,Finance Research Paper,"Hello everyone,

My professor assigned a research paper on banking or the financial services industry.  We are allowed to choose the question that we would like to answer.

Some examples are:

•	Have the recent changes in banking regulations resulted in less competition in the banking industry?

•	Has the securities industry succeeded in transferring credit and interest rate derivatives from principal transactions to exchange-based transactions as intended in the Dodd-Frank act?

•	Has the Dodd Frank Act succeeded in reducing the banking industry risk?

•	While regulators and politicians fear that banks are too big to fail, analysts believe that some banks are too big to manage effectively. Is there evidence to support this view?

•	Are FRB stress tests a useful means of determining the ability of banks to withstand a financial crisis?

•	Are negative interest rates an effective economic stimulant?


I am looking for some ideas of other similar types of questions that I could use as my research topic.

personalfinance,More closing credit card questions.,"After reading a previous post about closing old credit cards, I had some questions of my own. Due to some poor decisions in my college years I racked up over $12k in credit card debt. I have been working hard to pay that down, and by this time next year should be credit card debt free. As part of paying this down I have opened two new credit cards with the 0% intro rate on balance transfers. Once these are paid off, should I close them? They will be paid off before the end of the 0% period, but they have very high rates after that (like 20% or something outrageous). I have two other credit cards with very low interest rates and high credit lines that I have had for 10+ years. I just purchased a house, and am not looking to make any large purchases in the near future, so I'm not incredibly worried about my credit rating, but don't want to screw myself over either. Any advice would be welcomed.



*Edit: Some clarification; I no longer use the old cards. I haven't spent anything on a credit card in more than two years. I told the credit card companies I no longer intend to use the cards but want to keep the accounts open and both seemed like that was totally fine. Also, the new credit cards will only be ~1 year old when I have them paid off, so will it really ""bring down the average age of accounts"" when I've had the others for so long?",finance,1478117748

financialindependence,Buying a house all cash,"Hello Reddit FI,

Wanted to run this scenario by some experienced individuals.  I am a first time homebuyer and do not have a network of experienced RE investors around.


I made 800k after taxes in an IPO related scenario.  I have been not working for two years following the cash out.  My original goals were to find investments and begin passive income.  I had my assets in mutuals/bonds for the last 1.5 years and wasnt getting positive cashflow against my rental/cost of living here in Southern California.  With an expected downturn in the market i turned to RE investing.

I originally had a loan setup for 200k (asset based lending), but it fell through at the 11th hour after getting into escrow on a 500k property.  I have been trying to diversify by putting money into real estate for over a year, but have not won my bids, meanwhile the market continues to climb. 



I never wanted to put this much of my portfolio into RE, but now im beginning to think it could be a good move.  

*The house is 500k

*Rents for ~2,500

*HOA 160

*Needs updating, and has a few hairline foundation cracks im getting assessed. 

*I expect ~20k upfront in improvements and catching up in deferred maintenance.  



Great private lot within 2 miles of beach.  Good neighborhood, decent schools.  One of the last areas in the Southern California coastline you can get a property at this price at that proximity to the ocean. 

I am debt free, i pulled my asset out of mutual funds/bonds and want to start into a portfolio in RE.  I have not yet secured a job and see this as a way to produce positive cashflow and ultimately secure loans against the home and buy up more property.  

My big question: Should i wait until i can buy a property with less of my overall asset by securing a loan (while the interest rates are at an all time low) or should i move on the market and buy all cash, starting the stream of cashflow, but reducing my asset significantly upfront.  



Right now i am set on buying cash - 

*Cashflow begins

*Loans available against appreciation and household for future ventures

*I live in the area and have the availability to manage

*An area i understand



Bad - 

*Foundation cracks being investigated,

*some termite damage to deck which may cost 10k if replaced

*HOA fees

*Washes account of significant funds and limits other investment opportunities. 



My experience so far is that great investments dont come knocking on your door.  I have heard pitches for 100 ideas, strategies, and businesses.  After simple vetting they all seemed like trash.  Right now i would rather sit on a rental single family home, than keep pulling out of my savings and waiting for 'the next big thing'.

Thanks for your consideration and for investing your time for reply!

personalfinance,Employer doesn't match 401k - should I put my monthly leftover into Vanguard on my own instead?,"My employer's 401K has about 1.2% fees, so I opted out of it since there's no match and Vanguard has lower fees (0.25-0.75) for the existing ETFs I have. 

Should I be throwing my current savings at my Roth 401K so the interest can grow in there tax-free (i.e. am I missing out on that combined 401k+IRA limit of $23,000) or is it equivalent to just throw it in my ETFs? I don't plan to buy a house - want to stay flexible on location &amp; renting is affordable and low-energy - or have kids in the next couple of years, but I imagine one advantage of ETFs is that the money is more liquid and opens up more options in my 30s and 40s, though a Roth has all those exceptions.

My plan is once I hit the 91K+ income level I'll start putting away pre-tax income to get back to the 25% federal tax threshold. Should I also be putting away pre-tax money to diversify my tax risk by the time I reach retirement? I think my risk-averse self feels like I should pay taxes now and ""get it over with"" so I don't have to worry about it later, but this also could just be useless anxiety logic.",finance,1478133287
personalfinance,"22, About to graduate with Bachelors degree, In a decent amount of credit card/student loan debt. No idea where to go and what to do.","So here are the basics, I'm 22, turning 23 next week. I'm about to graduate from my local university with a Bachelors Degree  in Business Administration with a focus in Management. Last month I received and accepted an internship at a new company that's growing very fast, located about 45 miles away from where I live. I still live with my mom and stepfather, and my current vehicle is in poor condition, about to fall apart.

I've been in school for 9 semesters, all of which has been paid for through financial aid and scholarships. I have $22,500 in Direct Subsidized Loans and $8,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loans. I also had $28,415 in federal pell grants and $5,536 in state pell grants. I will graduate in December with a Bachelors degree in Business Administration with a focus in Management. 

My internship started 3 weeks ago, I'm making $10/hour and work between 20 and 25 hours per week. It is a 45 mile drive from my house, all highway. This job has the potential to turn into a full time position with a starting salary of $50,000 and full benifits. I've worked minimum wage jobs, no more than 30 hours a week, with few exceptions, since April 2015. 

I have no savings at all. Living with my parents, I don't pay many bills. I pay around $450 every 6 months for car insurance, I'm on my grandparents plan. I also pay around $75/month for various services (Phone, Netflix, Spotify), nothing extreme. I'm included on my Mothers health and dental insurance.

When I was a freshman in college I was advised to get a credit card, and to only use it for emergencies. I didn't tell anyone but i actually got three credit cards. For the first year I did well. Only bought things with them when I knew I had enough money to pay for it and always payed it immediately after the purchase. After the first year I had a few major expenses and it just got out of control. I racked up about $2000 in debt and only payed about $300 of it. After that i just started ignoring the bills when they came. Now with interest and everything, I owe around $3500, all to collection agencies. 

I've had the same car since right before i started college. I purchased it for $2,000 from a family friend who was selling assets to pay for a lawyer because she was being sued. The car had 220,000 miles at the time and is now over 260,000 The only things that were wrong with the car then were the transmission slipping every now and again and the paint on the rear end of the car was starting to fade. Now the car leaks oil, the heater and air conditioner are both not working, the power steering fluid is leaking somewhere, the transmission still slips, and the paint from the top of the rear doors and around the rear windshield is very faded, the trunk has no clear coat and is beginning to rust, and also has a few very large scratches/dents. There is a rust spot above the front windshield where water has been getting under the sealing for who knows how long, and there is rust starting under one of the rear wheel wells. I recently got a new windshield put in the car (they clear-coated the hell out of the rust up there so that will slow it down a decent amount), changed the oil and filter, and put on new front brake pads. Over the years I've had the car, I've had the power steering pump go out and replaced, the heater has been fixed twice (it worked for about a week after each time and then stops), and made sure to maintain routine maintenance. The car gets around 22-23 miles per gallon. If I keep the car it will need new tires before winter as where I live is below 40 degrees for the most part from the end of November until mid March. I could sell the car for $1000, maybe more.

A lot of the current issues have started in the last couple months. I've been looking for a new vehicle, my cousin offered me a good car with just under 180,000 miles. The car gets around 40 mpg. He is asking for $2500 just to cover what he has left to pay on it. My Mother and Grandfather have both told me they would help me pay for the car now but I will need to pay them back over the next few months. Everyone in my family is saying a new car is a necessary expense considering I drive at the very minimum 350 miles per week and my car is in rough shape. 

Nobody knows how much credit card debt I'm in. My girlfriend has been pressuring me for a couple months to find an apartment for myself and move out of my parents home and I know that once I graduate college that my family will also pressure me to move out.

I'm not sure where to start with paying off my debt from college. I'm not sure what to do about my credit card debt. I don't know how I should start saving money. Please help me find the first step and eventually get my finances together.

personalfinance,I'm a college student in need of a new checking account. Can you help me decide?,"&gt; So I recently got a new job in my college town, and all my life I've just had a checking account in my hometown with our local hometown bank, which I loved I guess. Now that I'm away from home, I'm finding it very hard to deposit checks since there are no branches or ATM's for my bank where my college is, and since my home city is pretty far from where I live now, I can't do the drive every week just to deposit a check. So I decided to get a new checking bank account, here's my requirements:  
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; - needs to be a trusted and secure bank  
&gt; - must have ATM's in college town and around country (I want to be able to access it wherever I  go)  
&gt; - must be able to do online banking  
&gt; - must be free to hold  
&gt; - must be able to deposit checks online  
&gt; - transfer funds to/from different banks  
&gt; - good customer support
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; BONUSES:

&gt; 

&gt; - might be good to see if I can get a rewards debit card with the bank I choose

&gt; - I really like how some of the online banks (except Simple) have crazy interest rates for savings accounts

&gt; - need good features that are relevant to me

&gt; - I like the feature that the bank rounds each purchase up to the nearest dollar and puts the difference in a savings account (ex: Bank of America's 'Keep the Change' and Chime does this as well)
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; So what banks have I looked at? I've looked at Bank of America, Ally Bank, Chime Bank, Simple Bank.   
&gt;   
&gt; Here's what I like about each, and what I wish it had.   
&gt;   
&gt; BoA:  
&gt; LIKES  
&gt;   
&gt; - Brick and Mortar  
&gt; - ""Keep the Change"" program  
&gt; - Rewards and perks to a bunch of store even with a debit card  
&gt; - online check deposit with app  
&gt;   
&gt; DISLIKES  
&gt;   
&gt; - few actual ATM's where my college is  
&gt; - poor interest for savings accounts  
&gt; - only free until I graduate college
&gt;   
&gt; Ally Bank:  
&gt; LIKES  
&gt;   
&gt; - Crazy good interest for savings accounts  
&gt; - Lots of ATM's   
&gt; - Good customer service  
&gt; - Reimburse you for ATM charges (though there's a limit but still)  
&gt; - no fees  
&gt; - online banking  
&gt;   
&gt; DISLIKES  
&gt;   
&gt; - They don't have as many features as the other online banks  
&gt; - no Goals or Automatic savings features
&gt;   
&gt; Chime Bank  
&gt; LIKES  
&gt;   
&gt; - no fees  
&gt; - great app  
&gt; - they have a cool feature where it's like Keep the Change from Bank of America, PLUS they will pay me 10% of what's in my savings account (so it's like Ally and Bank of America combined...)  
&gt; - cool rewards  
&gt; - online banking  
&gt; - good support  
&gt;   
&gt; DISLIKES  
&gt;   
&gt; - no chip card (that I know of)   
&gt; - not as many ATM's as Ally or Simple (who use Allpointe whereas Chime uses Moneypass)  
&gt; - doesn't have one cool feature like Simple does, that is their ""Goals"" feature
&gt;   
&gt; Simple Bank  
&gt; LIKES  
&gt;   
&gt; - Really cool feature that's called ""Goals"" which sets aside automatically some money everyday for a goal you choose, therefore helping you save, which is really really useful to me as I'm going to Italy in March and am trying to save for that and if it does it automatically it'll help me be responsible  
&gt; - biggest network of ATM's  
&gt; - no fees  
&gt; - great app  
&gt; - online banking  
&gt; - really fast transfers  
&gt;   
&gt; DISLIKES  
&gt;   
&gt; - doesn't have the Keep the Change or Automatic Savings feature that the other banks have though Goals is kind of the same  
&gt; - don't know their interest rates or if they even have savings accounts, my money isn't making money   
&gt; - no rewards  
&gt; - don't know their international policies or charges
&gt;   
&gt; I really wish I could have a bank that merges Chime and Simple together, as those two are my favorites. I know I could get Simple bank features using the Level Money app, but I'm not sure about it.   
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Which one do y'all suggest? Based on my needs and my likes/dislikes could you help me decide one, or do you have a better option? Also, I was looking into also opening up a credit card account too..though I've never had one. I know it'll be easier and safer since I can use the credit card for daily things and just pay it off with my checking account. Which is the best? Thank you so much!!",finance,1478141253

personalfinance,"After 10+ years at big banks, gave a credit union a shot, and I'm quite impressed","So I've had most of my day to day and savings/checking with big banks. Chase/Discover/Capital One mainly.  No real problems. 

Recently bought a new car financed through Ally Bank. 72mo @ 2.74% and my credit score is almost touching 800.  I was okay with the interest rate, however I soon found out how difficult they made it to pay towards principal.  Impossible online, you literally had to make a normal payment that their system would see as applied towards next month, the call them and have it ""applied"" towards principal.   The few times I put in extra money towards the loan, the customer service rep screwed everything up because I'm guessing they don't get many people wanting to pay double every month. 

Long story short -- local aggieland credit union not too far from my house. Talked to them before I opened an account and they showed me that yes, they can take principal payments on an auto loan 100% online without the need for a rep. (very cool!)   Even better was the fact they approved me for 1.99% for 72mo.   Huzzah!

Refinance was a 5 minute process online, 5 minute chat on the phone and they cut a check to ally that day.  Holy crap, I was waiting longer than that on hold just to make an extra payment to Ally. 

Overall -- very impressed! What they lack in size they make up with in how nimble and quick they can be.

personalfinance,shopping for mortgages and interest rates?,"Background:

Ready to make offer on a house, in the area of $240,000. The plan is to pay 20% down.

I make $58,000/year. Credit is 810. My other half makes $41,600 a year, credit is very low because of no credit history.

**EDIT: We have no debt.**

We've spoken to one mortgage company and were told it will only be me on the loan because of our wildly different credit ratings.

Interest rate is 3.625
APR is 3.7

**Are these numbers too high? Should they be lower? Since I have already been pre-approved, can I shop around for a potentially better loan while still getting the process started on making an offer?**

I see online ads stating 3.4% and numbers almost a half of a percent lower. Could this because they are only taking my salary into account? Or am I getting screwed?",finance,1478176256

personalfinance,Question about subsidized loans,"Hello!

I am in the process of consolidating my private and federal student loans (separately) to get better interest rates. I noticed something about my federal subsidized loans that I haven't been able to find an answer on google for. 

I originally had 4 federal subsidized loans through Sallie Mae (now Navient). At some point two of these were sold to AES. I wasn't informed properly and I missed the first payment, so I lost out on the 48 on time payments interest rate reduction. I've made my peace with this. However, the original interest rates as shown on Navient.com are 5.5% and 6% (fixed). On the AES site they are shown as 6.55% fixed for both. If I agreed to a fixed interest rate at the time of disbursement, can they do this? I've been paying on this loan and it has been accruing interest since 2012. It seems like even though it was transferred to another company the original fixed interest rate should have been preserved. 

Thank you for any help you can give!",finance,1478186498

- Expense Ratio - 0.06% annual (6 basis points)

- $10 management fee/quarter - ($40 Annual)

I have just over $3,000 in the account, so the $40 annual management fee accounts for another .0133% cost of maintaining the account (7.33 basis points total) which is still pretty cheap.  But would I be better off moving it to Vanguard either as a 401k or IRA?


Additionally, $2,800/$3,000 of it my funds are traditional (default option when I was first employed, didn't know the difference between Roth/Traditional) and as my income is fairly low (15% federal income tax bracket) should I at least move the traditional portion to Roth and pay the tax margin differential?

personalfinance,Basic Mortgage Refinance Question,"I swear I searched first and checked the wiki and didn't see anything as basic as mine. 

We have a $234K mortgage at a 4.625% rate on a $400K home. Our monthly payments are $1,777 which includes escrow (homeowners and taxes). 

Refinance offer is at 3.75% (no points), making our total payment drop to $1,477 (again, escrow included).

Closing takes our loan to $238K ($1,900 in closing costs, $1,800 for escrow reserves and $500 prepaid interest, which I don't quite understand, am I skipping a month in payments?), so ""closing costs"" are a little over $4K. 

We are planning on renting this place out and buying another place in a year. The additional $300 every month will help us save for our next down payment ($200K), BUT it isn't necessary if we end up losing money in the end. 

It SEEMS like we would make up the closing costs after a year, but then I try to tack on the interest onto the closing costs and I get a bit confused. I know the bank is making money off of me which makes me weary, but it seems I might save a decent amount of money due to the lower interest rate.

I seem to have very quickly gotten to about $40,000 in credit card debt with an income of only $30,000. I am curious what I should do regarding the debt?

I don't want to get into too many specifics because I'm looking for general answers. My limits are from $1k to $15k. The creditors include Capital One, Chase, Alliant Credit Union, Discover, SECU, and American Express.

My credit score was around 740 a year ago. Now it is 660 with the high balances. Not sure if I would be approved for any more credit products, or if it would be a good idea to even consider any.

This month I've suddenly found myself in a situation where I can no longer pay the minimum payments on 3-4 cards. I'm beyond what I can even ask to borrow from anyone. I could possibly pay some of the smaller ones and maybe that would prevent higher interest rates. I share rent with people, and I ended up needing to pay more than I usually do.

I want to research the Credit Counseling Services, and it looks like I wanna steer clear of Debt Management Companies. I'm not sure if my debt is just so bad I just need to file for bankruptcy. I'm interested in any opinions there.

I am at a complete loss for what to do. I'm the type of person that has always paid every bill on time, and all of a sudden not being able to pay anything is a bit of a shock. I believe I've solved the personal problems that have caused me to generate this debt, but it's still early there. For this thread I really wanna focus on how to manage or address my debt, as I have never been in this type of situation. Should I be calling my creditors?

1) Pre-tax contributions

2) Post-tax Roth contributions

3) Post-tax non-Roth contributions

Now as I understand it, options 1 and 2 are virtually identical with regards to contribution limits, etc. with the only difference being that one modifies my gross income for tax purposes and defers taxes until disbursement(option #1), while the other does not modify my taxable income but all gains made are not subject to federal income tax at the time of disbursement (option #2). If any of that is incorrect please let me know.

Now where I get confused is with option #3. I was always under the assumption that the maximum employee contribution to a 401k was $18,000/yr. I'm currently doing this via pre-tax contributions. When I look at information for option #3, it is saying that I can contribute a maximum of $53,000/yr. How is this possible?

personalfinance,(Ohio) trying to maximize interest savings with a set budget for mortgage and student loan payments each month while refinancing.,"**Premise:**  my parents are looking into refinancing their house to get a better interest than they currently have.  They are looking at a cash out or a straight refinance for reasons I will explain.  In either of the mortgages they will have better rates, so the current situation is irrelevant because it will be going bye-bye soon.

**The Problem:** the options available to them are convoluted, the maximum interest savings is hard to determine because they are also trying to consolidate 31,000$ of student loans in the smartest way possible.  

There is a set budget of 750$ per month for both of these debts.  There will always be 750$ being paid out until BOTH debts have been paid in full (unless there is better way to do this I don't know about).  We are trying to figure this out because once the student loans are gone, there will be additional money being paid into the mortgage to hurry it up.  Additionally, the cash-out option can roll up to ~19,000$ of the student loans into the mortgage (up 104,000 total), with no closing costs. It would leave anywhere from 31,000$ - $12,000 up to my parents to handle in some way either where it is now, or in a home equity loan, or some other option unknown to us. 


**They could do a number of things:**

* Refinance 85,000 @ 3.875 for 20 years via traditional means and have to pay closing costs.  leave student loans alone.

* Refinance 85,000 @ 3.875 for 20 years via traditional means and have to pay closing costs.  get a home equity loan for student loans assuming its better interest rate (it would likely be able to cover all of it with the rest of the home's equity).

* Refinance cash-out option --&gt; 85,000 + X = up to 104,000 total @ 4.125% also for 20 years and pay no closing costs. take X amount of loans and roll them into the mortgage.  leave the rest alone.

* Refinance cash-out option --&gt; 85,000 + X = up to 104,000 total @ 4.125% also for 20 years and pay no closing costs. take X amount of loans and roll them into the mortgage.  get a home equity loan for the difference in the 31,000 of SL's and X (again assuming its a better interest rate)

I don't know what closing costs would be.

the student loans are as follows:

* 16,266 @ 7.65%

* 5,576.66 @ 7.65%

* 2,436.29 @ 6.1%

* 6,326.53 @ 6.96%

I need some help as I think you guys can see.  Every amortization table I run seems incomparable because the amount of time overpaying after the Student Loans are gone changes every time and impacts the Mortgage heavily.

From Nov 2015 to Mar 2016, I was paying child support of $550/no. So back in April 2016 I signed up for national debt relief as I was in a financial struggle to pay my bills. An agreement was made so I don't have to pay anymore support temporarily, at this point I was 90 days late on all my creditors. So I heard of National Debt Relief and decided to sign up. I was told not to pay my creditors anymore so they can negotiate.


I did just that, they were able to “negotiate” 2 of my creditors. 

Now last night I pulled up my credit report and OMG… I feel like they did nothing. On the NDR website it shows one amount and on my credit report it shows a higher one. A few of them even got charged off. I didn't realize the impact this would have on me. 


Before I go on further let me list down the debts that was on my credit report (CR) the debt shown on national debt relief (NDR) and what they claimed to have negotiated.

Capitol One - $3550 CR, $3349 NDR (negotiated and “paying” $1775)


I plan on opening a PO Box and start communicating that way in writing only via certified mail. I know I need to validate the debts. I want to start inputting my info in power pay so I can snowball this, but don't know where to begin. 


All mail and phone calls have been forwarded NDR so I don't know which collection agency wants the debt. Should I call the creditors first? Should I call NDR to cancel first? Will collection agencies allow me to pay monthly? Does collection agencies have an interest rate like credit cards do?

I'm a little frustrated at the moment. Half way through this semester of my sophomore year, I got an email that Student Financial Services is doubling what I have to pay. Their email that I was sent on October 5th reads: ""…Due to the fact that your sibling who attends [University] is a graduate student, there was a change in your financial aid package. Graduate students are not considered in our analysis, therefore your parental contribution will increase accordingly."" My sister is still in her fourth year and would normally be considered a senior, but she is in a pharmacy program and her school breaks it down to a 3 + 3 (3 years undergrad, three years grad) rather than a 4 + 2 system. Although it has not been explicitly explained to me by my financial aid office, it is my understanding that she no longer factors into their analysis because she is now eligible for larger loans and (theoretically) requires less money from our parents (who are unable to pay anyway, so we're both getting loans).  
I am in a slim margin that is too “wealthy” to qualify for a full ride (&gt;$65,000) but certainly not wealthy enough to shoulder the burden of my debt without loans.     
Previously, I was paying $3,352 a semester, but I now owe ~$7577 a semester. I paid “too little” last semester because they didn’t look at the paperwork I submitted and realize my sister is a grad student, so they are adding the payment for last semester to my bill for next semester in addition to the new increase for next semester so it is $10,784. I understand that this might not seem like a lot, but in my current situation it is a significantly more than I can afford. I’ve tried really hard to remain debt free up until this point because I would really love to attend medical school which will require me to incur even greater debt. Right now it looks like I will have to take out $6,500 in Federal Direct Student Loans (the maximum allowable amount as far as I can tell) and hope that the bulk of the loan I am provided with will be subsidized.

If I am using their calculator properly (about ~$350 per credit hour, most classes are 3 credit hours), then I am looking at around $1,000 per semester class. 

I don't come from a family with the kind of money to pay for anything more than one semester of a class, much less two semesters or even other classes. Not to mention we are dealing with some medical payments that simply make it impossible to put down that kind of money. 

I don't know what options are out there for me to pay for this. I am looking at all outlets I know, but by being a junior I'm ineligible for many of them. If there are options based on merit I don't know, I would very likely be eligible, but I simply cannot find any. I can't be sure this is the right place, but if anyone knows of options or outlets I should look into, I would be eternally grateful. 

If there isn't an option out there, there isn't an option, and I'll have to accept that, I suppose. But this would be a huge deal and classes at this college would be greatly beneficial, and I will go to as many lengths as I can to take these classes.

Thank you for your time. If this isn't the right place, I apologize, and would be grateful if you could redirect me to the right place.",finance,1478224445

personalfinance,About to start paying student loans..,"Hey guys! I'm about to start making payments on my student loans and after reading through some of the material provided through this subreddit i have some questions rising to the top of my head.

First: How are payments handled when you have multiple non-consolidated loans? If I had planned a budget to put X amount of money into my student loans each month would I have to divide X among each of those loans?

Second: Is consolidation really worth it? It seems, and it may be because I am uneducated in the matter, that I would save money by knocking out multiple smaller loans with varying interest rates than one giant loan with a fixed interest rate since the interest will be much more monthly due to the size of a single large loan.

Finally and maybe a really stupid question to ask: Interest on loans is accrued monthly correct? 

Some quick information before I sign off and wait for responses: Ever since I started taking out loans for school I always knew I would go hard on paying them back to get out from underneath the debt as quickly as possible. When I got mail detailing my consolidated loans it just appeared like it may be worse for me financially.

personalfinance,For those who preach 20% down payment to everyone,"I may get bashed for this post, but after browsing this sub for many months I've noticed that many people give blanket advice to all people for all scenarios. One piece of advice that sticks out in particular is the general disgust in this sub for PMI. Many people in this sub have seen others in this sub talk about how PMI is a waste of money, and if you can't save up 20% for a down payment then you're not ready to buy a house.

Let me preface this by saying that in most situations a 20% down payment for a house is ideal. It gets you a lower rate on your mortgage and you can avoid the added PMI payments. But I think a lot of times people get so discouraged that they don't have 20% down that they decide to delay purchasing a home without considering outside factors.

For example, what if a young couple has adequate cash flow to afford a mortgage but simply has not had enough time to save for a 20% down payment? For instance, millennials who just graduated from college, settled down in an area, have stable jobs, but haven't been working full-time long enough to build up a down payment fund. It's more likely than not that they can and will pay their mortgage every month, yet the general advice in this sub is to wait until they have 20% down no matter what.

I propose to this couple that they should seriously consider purchasing a house sooner than later. Why? What about the money they will throw down the drain from their PMI? The answer is interest rates. It's no secret that the Fed is going to be raising interest rates soon, with the next rate hike likely being next month. While mortgage rates don't move in lockstep with fed funds rates, they are likely to gradually move higher as rates continue to rise. With mortgage rates being at all time lows, the risk of delaying a mortgage is increasing more and more. The thing with PMI is that it goes away. Your mortgage rate will be the same for 30 years (assuming no refinance, which is unlikely to happen in a rising rate environment anyway). Which has a greater effect? The temporary increased payments from PMI or the permanent increased payments from delaying your mortgage?

Disclaimer-I just ran this math quickly and am open to criticism if I did it incorrectly. I used [this(http://usmortgagecalculator.org/) mortgage calculator to dig into this a bit. Assuming a $200k home price, I compared the total payments of principal, interest, and PMI of 2 scenarios:

1) My young couple from before has only saved enough for a 10% down payment ($180k mortgage). For simple numbers, let's assume their credit is great and they qualify for a 3.5% 30 yr fixed mortgage. Since they have less than 20%, they will pay .5% PMI until their loan to value ratio is 80%.

2) This same couple, but they have taken this sub's advice and waited until they have 20% down ($160k mortgage). Let's assume this takes them a year. Let's also assume that mortgage rates have gone up .5% in that time, so they qualify for a mortgage at 4%.

The numbers show that the couple in scenario 1 pays $864.75 more than scenario 2 over a 30 year mortgage. Just under $30/yr.

Obviously there are over 1,000 scenarios we can draw up to compare. We can change the value of the home, the credit of the applicant, the down payments, etc. Let's not go too crazy with alternate scenarios as this is more conceptual. An area for PMI naysayers to critique is the assumption on interest rates, but I would argue that one can't assume rates will continue to be this low for the foreseeable future, especially considering that the fed has made it clear, much more so than they did when they raised rates last year, that they intend to begin raising rates.

This is not to say everyone who can qualify for a mortgage should do so. The point here is that everyone's situation is different, and it's important when we give advice as a sub that we do so based off of each person (it is **personal** finance after all). In many cases it's wise to save 20% down, but in some scenarios it may be more beneficial to capitalize on an opportunity now rather than wait. I realize there are other costs and factors that go into home ownership, but avoiding your dream home or a great deal just to save up money in hopes that you can avoid PMI down the road might not always be the best advice. Consider the options and alternatives for each person, and don't assume everyone is the same.

tl;dr With rising interest rates, it might be okay to pay PMI.

Edit: For clarity, I'm not making an argument for someone who can't afford the payments, can't save any money, etc. My thoughts are if someone has an adequate emergency fund, adequate cash flow, but hasn't saved the 20% for a house (maybe due to paying off loans, just entering the labor market), do they purchase a home now and take PMI for a couple years, or do they wait 1-2 years to purchase the home to avoid the PMI. This is not a rent vs. buy question or a discussion of the other costs involved in home ownership.",finance,1478289130

Caveat: I am a CPA and do some investing for myself based on the awesome advice in PF. So don't feel the need to 'ELI5' if you don't want to. This question is for my brother, who is a Junior at the Air Force Academy in CO, USA. 

He has the opportunity to receive the ""Cadet Starter Loan"" through USAA. Some info on the loan can be found here: http://the-military-guide.com/how-to-smartly-use-the-usaa-career-starter-loan/ 

I've already talked to him how he doesn't HAVE to take the loan at all, but that it's just an exclusive benefit that he has the choice to use. He still wants to use it. He can receive a loan up to $36k. Payments are deferred until after graduation. He will be receiving an officer's salary upon graduation, which I believe will be around $40k (correct me if I'm way off) with very few expenses. He has no other debt. This leads me to believe that he would have no trouble repaying the loan payments once they kick in.

Cloud,How 1and1 Cloud service compares to Dreamhost and DigitalOcean,"1and1 recently revised their cloud service so I decided to sign up.  I already use DreamHost, DigitalOcean, and AWS.  The one thing that stands out for me is that 1and1 is one of the only VMware cloud services with reasonable prices.  I've used Dimension Data which has VMware but it's horrendously expensive and rather inflexible.

The ""Medium"" instance type is about $10/month for 1 GB of RAM, 50 GB of SSD storage, unlimited transfer, and comes with a free SSL certificate and a free domain name like 1and1's other hosting plans (which I also use).  I couldn't sign up for the cheapest $5/month instance for some reason but it shows up after you sign up.

The reason I chose to write this post is because 1and1 uses VMware and having hosted VMware in a professional setting I wanted to see how much better it performs on 1and1.  VMware, in my experience, has always outperformed any other hypervisor, especially the heavily oversubscribed hosts that I run.

So far, unlike any other service I've used, (I'm looking at you, Amazon), 1and1 sets up the volumes in lvm2 volume groups with the balance of the drive space unallocated.  This is huge for FedRAMP and other kinds of systems that require heavily customized volumes.  I am still astonished that AWS still doesn't offer this feature.  1and1 also allocates a dedicated swap volume which is something the other services don't offer for some reason.

All three have direct console access using a virtual KVM, which is nice, but AWS inexplicably still doesn't offer this feature.  

The 1and1 machines are very fast.  The IOPS were 22693 read, 7567 write.

DigitalOcean was twice as fast at 42836 read, 14284 write.  They're also the only one to have network transfer limits.

DreamHost ""new"" cluster was extremely slow at 3106 read, 1035 write.

DreamHost ""old"" cluster (which shuts down in January) was twice as slow compared to their ""new"" cluster, at 1500 read, 500 write.

I'm not sure what DreamHost is doing wrong but it's really bad even with their second generation OpenStack system.  DigitalOcean is very good performing but they skimp on disk space and memory, though they have a nice catalog of one-click applications.  1and1 is also very good and also offers the ability to mount an ISO volume, which is something I've only seen on RackSpace Cloud until now.  The free SSL and domain name is a nice value and being hosted on expensive VMware servers makes it a good value for me.  Unfortunately, the Click and Build Apps and the 1&amp;1 Web Apps don't seem to be available to 1and1 Cloud.

Those are my rambling thoughts about these cloud services.  If you know of any other cloud services that use VMware and cost $5 or $10 per month let me know.

*EDIT:*  I seem to have found the Cloud Apps at https://www.1and1.com/cloud-app-center/cloud-applications but they don't seem to be present in the cloud control panel, though, because they are dedicated servers that run that one app, as opposed to installing multiple apps on your own cloud server.  I think DigitalOcean does it this way, too.  I prefer to run more than one app per instance.


*EDIT 2:*  Bitnami offers the equivalent self-contained software installations, but don't use their 1and1 Cloud integration, which just launches one server per app, which isn't economical.  Just download their software application ""*.run"" files and run them on your cloud instance.  It works nicely.",technology,1478296444
personalfinance,Wells Fargo vs Federal Agency Credit Union,"I recently started working for a federal government agency and will be working there for at least two years.

Should I also open a checking account with them and switch everything and get rid of my Wells stuff? I've only ever had one bank at a time so keeping track of two makes me feel somewhat nervous.

I always heard credit unions are better but I still don't really know what the benefits are, other than more personalized customer service (never had a CS issue with Wells so far, although I know other people have).

personalfinance,Should I buy a house or rent until I have another job?,"I am currently a college junior and should graduate in just over a year from now. I will have $12k in

raise in August.


  Because I work remotely I had no need to move to the downtown area that the office is in, I plan 
on settling down in the town I am in now without plans of moving in the future. Once out of college

got a credit card last February so time is my largest factor). I think this should give me a pretty ideal

I closed in May 2016 and I have a 3.5% interest rate on a 30 year fixed rate. They want me to refinance to get down to 3.25%. They claim that it's too keep my business and not have another company come and offer better refi options. What are the pros and cons of refinancing in such as short period of time?

personalfinance,Advice figuring out best move,"As many already know there is a federal law changing non-exempt employees from hourly to salary. This particular law goes into effect December 1, however my job is implementing it next week. I went from being paid a salary based off 55 hours a week to now currently scheduled 48 hours as of next week. If that continues I will miss out on 20% of my previous salaried pay. This cuts into my budget big time. I am wondering how to go about negotiating toward a new job based off all the changes. Unfortunately, the skill set I now have would not necessarily put me in the top range for my position due to lack of experience. At the top range my current market value is around 66k, but at the bottom it is 41k with the median at 45k. Since I may not get the minimum 47k salary how do I go about negotiations. So do I simply convert my salary to hourly pay and only accept that? 

Also, I don't know how do I take overtime into account? Will my new company offer that? Should be able to trust that to come into play every week since it's not like salary pay? Can I trust the interviewer? Should I stick with my current job and hope sales pick back up enough to sustain my previous pay? Right now at my current hourly wage I would be making around the same as my subordinates. I have short term goal of going into the millitary in April  (would have been January, but my sister decided to get married in April and I want to atttend.)

Without the car it would have been around 5 months expenses. I was still recovering from the car purchase....  With 48 hours or anything under 55 hours it will be practically living paycheck to paycheck since I would only be able to save less than 5% of my income. 

Any advice???",finance,1478302221
economy,Questions About the Government's Role in Banking and Taxes,"Hello, economists of reddit! I am 15 years old and I have a lot of questions about the US economy that I am having trouble coming up answers for (or at least answers I fully understand). My questions are specifically about the IRS and the Federal Reserve and the way they control the US economy. First the Federal Reserve. It is my understanding that they are not a government run organization, and they are responsible for distributing money to banks. My questions: 
How does the Federal Reserve decide to distribute money?

What is the structure of the Reserve in terms of leadership and who makes decisions for distribution? 

I have recently watched a ""conspiracy"" theory video on YouTube claiming that the Federal Reserve is really controlled by banks (I don't think it really explained how). Does the Federal Reserve give power to the banks above other banks, and do the banks have any methods of influencing the decisions of the Reserve?

Lastly, is the Federal Reserve really totally unmonitored by any outsiders? 

And for IRS, the video I mentioned above claims that it is also a corporation run by the banks. However, it seems to me that the IRS is a federal bureau that is directly under the federal government. My Questions: 

Is there no validity at all about a relationship between the IRA and large banks? 

How does the IRA enforce tax collection? (I am 15 so I have never had to pay taxes myself, this may be a stupid question to most so I apologize) 

How does the IRA distribute the money collected to the government? Does it pocket any money as a collection fee? 

Thanks",finance,1478302452

personalfinance,Credit Score and Student Loans,"Just a random question.  I currently have a ton of federal student loans (&gt;200,000) locked in at 6.8%.  I am going to refinance them through a private lender for 3.5-4% (depending on how long I want to take).  Basically the private lender gives you the money and you pay off the loans in one large payment.

How, if at all, will this change my credit score?  Are federal students loans even part of it? If so, will it hurt my score since I have technically had those loans for several years (just finished residency so they are all at least 5 years old)?

My current FiCO score according to my free score through my credit cards is in the 790s.  I do not have a specific need for any other loans (aside from the one I am about to take out for my student loans), but I don't want my score to crash in case I want to buy a house in a year or so.",finance,1478309103
personalfinance,Reduce 401(K) to pay off debt and save larger emergency fund. Smart or bad idea?,"My wife and I (28 and 31) have somewhat unique finances.  She makes $60,000 a year, I make $75,000.  We have a single car loan (my car) with $16,000 remaining.  My company is technically paying my car payments, but if the car is paid off entirely that money is still given to me.  They sell it as money for maintenance and gas, but whatever, its an extra $5000 a year.  My wife works for the government and has roughly $200,000 in federal student loan debt.  She is on IBR and currently pays roughly $200 a month towards the loan.  She is expected to be done with the program in seven more years, at that time she'll have paid $50,000 total (rest forgiven).  She loves her job, and not to sound arrogant, but her job security as safe as it gets.  The only downside is that in order for her loan payments to remain low we have to keep our finances separate.  It also means no Roth IRAs.  Anyways, to break it down a little further to keep this short:

&amp;nbsp;

My 401(K), 10% plus 6% match.
My wife's 401(K), 23% no match, 5% county funded pension
Current additional savings is about $4000 (we just bought a house and put $60,000 saved into the down payment)

&amp;nbsp;

Our current debt, $16,000 car loan, her student loan, and our mortgage (roughly $360,000 remaining)

&amp;nbsp;

To the point, we try to be avid savers.  Unfortunately my wife's loan forces us to sink as much money into her 401(K) as possible to keep her AGI low.  We currently save about $1000 a month as additional savings.  We were at about $2500 before buying the house.  We really want to pay off the car and put $10,000 into an emergency for job and health care costs, and have an additional $10,000 go into a general ""house"" emergency fund.  To my question, we want to hit this target within 18 months.

&amp;nbsp;

**Our thinking, and our question,** is it smart (or a bad idea) to reduce my 401(K) contributions to the match, put that additional income into aggressively paying off the loan and build that emergency fund, and then revert back to 10 to 15% after reaching that goal?  As it stands now we wouldn't hit our goals for an additional year.  We are planning to have children in about three to four years, so we'd like to have a larger gap between reaching that goal and the additional childcare costs.  Thoughts?",finance,1478309176

***
How to interpret this? In four of five states voting on November 8, legalization is almost certain. Only Nevada is uncertain. By far the most important ballot measure is California’s. 

Conclusions for investors? There will likely be an explosion of enthusiasm for marijuana stocks on November 9 as the public wakes up to news on Nov 9 that 1/4 of Americans can grow and consume marijuana legally. Or conversely, the likelihood of legalization is already baked in to marijuana stocks. Most US marijuana stocks are vulnerable to manipulation. As an investor I have very little trust in any direct investment into the industry.

For now, I’d suggest riding the wave of enthusiasm with an investment into an ancillary business. The largest legitimate company with skin in the game right now is **Scotts Miracle Gro - $SMG**. It has made aggressive moves to acquire hardware and hydroponics companies to generate products for home marijuana growing. SMG is betting that millions of new potential growers will look to get started with crops and invest in specialized hardware. They created a subsidiary Hawthorne Gardening company, with the goal of investing 500m into the sector. Their sales relating to hydroponic hardware, lighting, and specialized fertilizers are higher margins than the rest of their products, and that segment of the business is growing rapidly, relative to the rest of their products. 


 Acquisitions they’ve made in the last year:

* $136m for Gavita, a dutch grow lighting and hardware company. 

* $130m for general hydroponics 

* Botanicare, plant nutrient and hydroponics provider with $40m sales last year

Indoor marijuana production accounts for more than half of the market. Industrial marijuana processes will be much slower moving, especially in a still-uncertain regulatory environment. Large and established growers will wait until federal legalization to enter the market. Expect tobacco companies to take it over at that point. So ancillary companies which assist household marijuana production seems like a fair immediate bet. Scotts has become a decent proxy for the marijuana industry without being exposed to the same regulatory issues (they’ve kept their hands clean) and they have a traditional business segment too. Even though their stock as rallied coming into the election, I would expect it will appreciate if the California ballot measure passes. They also pay a fair 2.26% dividend. 

Some drawbacks with Scotts: 

* There has been [a fair bit of insider selling recently](http://imgur.com/a/jZ4uK)

* Their price is near all-time highs 

* Long term debt makes up ~70% of their capital structure  

What do you think? Any other suggestions for marijuana stocks that might be affected by the election? Thoughts on any other large companies with obvious exposure?",finance,1478354203

# **WEEK AHEAD: Election week could give Wall Street a wild ride** - *[(CNBC.com)](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/04/election-week-could-give-wall-street-a-wild-ride.html)*

*****

&gt; ###Pre-game and post-game, Wall Street will be handicapping outcomes of what has been the most contentious presidential election in recent history, and either way, markets could remain both volatile and vulnerable in the week ahead.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###As the race tightened between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump coming into November, stocks have been under pressure. The S&amp;P 500 ended the past week down 1.9 percent at 2,085.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###For months, the market had been pricing in a win by Clinton, and the idea that a Republican controlled Congress would keep her policies in check placated normally Republican Wall Street. Many analysts expect the market to rise several percent in a relief rally if she wins, but it could sell off sharply if the White House goes to Trump.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""What happens Monday and Tuesday, who knows? There's this general feeling that on Wednesday, people think it's binary. Trump wins, the market goes down. Hillary wins, the market goes up. It's more nuanced than that,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. ""If Hillary wins, and Democrats take the Senate, if you own health care or financial stocks, you're not going to be happy that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are running the Senate.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###There is also some concern that if the election is close, and Trump loses, he might challenge the outcome, creating more uncertainty for markets.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""We should all hope the winner, no matter who it is, is clear cut. We don't want to hear about whining losers. We want to elect the person and move on,"" Boockvar said.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Barclays analysts estimate the S&amp;P 500 could lose as much as 11 to 13 percent if Trump wins, and it faces headwinds of 4 to 5 percent if his probability of winning gets to 50 percent. They based their analysis on market moves and the election odds, after the first presidential debate. They also examined moves after the news of an FBI investigation into Clinton emails, and when Trump won key Republican primaries. PredictIt.org on Friday put the odds of a Trump win at 31 percent and a Clinton win at 74 percent, an improvement of about 6 points for Clinton over Thursday's level.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Keith Parker, Barclays global equity strategist, said the market may sell off on a Trump victory, but like the period after the U.K. Brexit vote in June, stocks may bounce back as investors focus on the economy and growth. The Fed is also expected to continue to be accommodative, and perhaps not hike rates, as expected in December if markets are turbulent.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""I think the real key is equities are all about confidence, and … my analysis is probably based on Trump's policies toward trade and immigration, which are very much a risk to economic growth, while his other policies on tax and fiscal spending are positive for growth. My clue as a strategist is that I would look to whether we see 'good Trump' or 'bad Trump,'"" said Parker.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Whether the market would spring back in a 'V,' like it did after Brexit, is not clear. ""I think that really is predicated on Trump's rhetoric and also what you're getting out of the economic data,"" he said. Parker said the market is still not pricing high enough odds of a Trump win, and it could be volatile Monday and Tuesday, ahead of the election results.

&gt; It looked as though S&amp;P 500 was finally going to end its losing streak at 8 consecutive days until the last hour of trading. Since 1950, there have only been 22 other S&amp;P 500 daily losing streaks of eight or more days. 11 of 22 went onto last 9 or more days. The worst by performance occurred early in October 2008 when S&amp;P 500 plunged 22.9% in eight trading days. The longest losing streak was in April and May 1966 at twelve days. Once the streak ended, S&amp;P 500 generally enjoyed a nice bounce and reversal of trend. This bounce and reversal can be seen in the above chart of S&amp;P 500 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after a losing streak of eight or more consecutive trading days.

In the following table, S&amp;P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after an eight straight day losing streak appears. 1-month later is somewhat mixed however, the average gain is 1.81%. 3-months after is stronger with S&amp;P 500 up 68.2% of the time averaging 4.5%. 6-months and 1-year later S&amp;P 500 further improved.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Election Day Seasonality Suggests Market Rally**
&gt; October did live up to its reputation of being weak in Election years. For S&amp;P 500 October’s 1.9% decline was its second worst monthly performance this year and it was also the third consecutive down month. DJIA has also declined in three straight months. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 suffered the most damage in October, off 2.3% and 4.8% respectively. October’s poor performance in presidential election years has historically been accompanied by an incumbent party loss since 1952 (see page 28 of Stock Trader’s Almanac 2016). In the following chart the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 16 presidential elections are plotted. 

###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/fb0b092f653468acd0dbefd35dbcb5d8/tumblr_inline_ofmjrjTVkF1spdppr_500.jpg))

&gt; In the above chart, Election Day is Day 0. Prior to 1984, the market was closed on Presidential Election Days so the close on the day before was used. Since 1984, the close of trading on Election Day was used. Day 26, to the left of “0” was the first trading day of October in 2016. As of today’s close, S&amp;P 500 is suggesting an Incumbent party defeat. It is also noteworthy to observe weakness across all three lines between 10 to 5 Trading days before Election Day and then a rally from right around 5 Trading days before to Election Day.

personalfinance,Co-signing a private seller auto loan. Help!,"I've desperately needed a new car for years now. Unfortunately, because of years of mismanaging my student loans, my credit is shot. I've slowly climbed out of what I thought was an insurmountable financial hole over the last 2.5 years, but am still extremely unattractive to lenders.

After explaining my situation to my sister and showing her the progress I've made, she's agreed to co-sign on a loan with me. So the car I plan on purchasing this week is being sold by a private seller. My question is, where do I turn for said loan? I've done a great deal of research and am aware that private seller loans carry a significantly higher interest rate. Should I approach my bank first? Are there any credible institutions that specialize in private seller loans?

Thanks in advance. Any advice is appreciated.",finance,1478362702

personalfinance,"(US) Been working for ~6 months post college, need advice maximizing saving for retirement and beyond","**tl;dr: I have good income, 0 debt and too much cash in a shitty savings account. How can I be smarter about saving for retirement and shorter term needs?**

Hey there! I'm 22. I started working in January (first job out of school) in NYC, and am trying to be proactive about my personal finances. I have been delaying making decisions about investing beyond my 401k because I needed to hoard liquid cash for several large expenses early on. Now that those expenses are resolved I want to work out a longer term game plan.

I recently got a promotion and raise at work, so I make $120,000 pre-tax. After paying rent/necessary expenses and a healthy amount of discretionary spending, I'm left with about $2800 / month. Right now I'm saving in fairly rudimentary ways:

**401k contributions**: $1500/mo (15% of my pretax, to max out at $18,000/yr. Employer does the standard 50% up to 6% match.)

**Savings Account**: $2,000/mo goes straight to a shitty low interest rate savings account that I do not touch for any reason. I know this is not a good way to save. 

**Other**: Whatever is leftover that I don't spend or actively save is just sitting in my checkings account.

I have 0 student loan debt thanks to the generosity of my parents and pay off my 2 credit cards in full each month, so I pay no interest of any sort and have effectively no debt. Now, I have ~$10,000 in my checking account and $28,500 in my savings just sitting around and devaluing since my non-existent interest definitely doesn't make up for inflation.

**Here are my goals:**

1. Slim down my shitty savings account to be a reasonable emergency fund which will cover my and my SO's bare minimum necessary expenses for 6 months. We live together so most of our big expenses are shared, and he hasn't had time to build an emergency fund of his own yet since he hasn't been working long and had the same large expenses as me. I estimate that this should be **$24,000** (which I can reduce once he's on his feet).

2. Open and max out an IRA. I was originally planning to get a Roth, but I see that there are limits for high income earners, and I'm not sure how my tax bracket will change now vs. in retirement. Given that, I'm not sure whether a Roth or Traditional IRA makes most sense for me. Am I even eligible for a Roth? I will make &lt; $117k this year because of my time off and late in the year promotion which makes me think so? But the salary limits make me nervous.

3. Open another kind of investment account which I can use for short to medium term saving (e.g. downpayment for a house in 5-8 years). My parents recommend CDs but I'm not sure if there are other instruments which make more sense.

**Questions**

Thanks for reading my life essay! Now that you have the context:

1. Which type of IRA makes most sense for me? I want to max out my IRA every year. Even if I am eligible for a Roth IRA this year since I'll be below the $117k (late in the year promotion + time off), what will happen next year? I know there's such a thing as a Backdoor Roth but I don't know how these things roll together.

2. Beyond CDs, are there other short-medium term investments that are easy to deal with but will have a greater payoff than letting my money rot in a savings account? Which of these might make sense in my situation?

3. Are there any gaps in my view of my finances that I should have on my radar? I have the privilege of getting to think about these things, which I'm so grateful of, and I want to make sure I get it right.

personalfinance,Student loan repayment plans for 50-year-olds?,"OK, here's my deal: I'm one of those people who had to borrow a lot for multiple degrees to get into my profession, so started my career at age 32 with $90K in debt. I'm a college professor so was only making about $35K then, so I consolidated my loans and elected for the extended payment plan-- 30 years at 5.25% --and have simply let the automated payments go ever since. I looked at the balance today and unsurprisingly I've paid about $75K in interest over the last 15 years and still have a $58K loan balance.

I've never changed the payment plan so am still only paying $500/month. Over the years our income has increased dramatically but so have expenses; we have kids, are paying private school tuition, and will paying for college from 2019-2027 (two kids born four years apart). Under the current payment plan my own loans will not be paid off until 2031.

Our AGI is about $90K, mortgage is about $1500, cars are paid for, no other debt, but we are diverting 10% for retirement, about 5% into an HSA, and $250/month into 529s for each kid . We *might* be able to double the payments on my loans for a few years, but tuition for private high school is $700/month (through 2023 in our case) and college tuition will hit starting in 2019. Since I work for a private, non-profit college I am eligible for the PSLF loan forgiveness program, but would have to change repayment plans. Or I could change to the ""standard"" 10-year plan, paying off my loans in 2026. Or I could just make extra payments when we're able.

At this point I'm looking for advice on strategy...simply ""send your kids to public school and feed them ramen"" is one option I've rejected. If there's a way to reduce the interest expense on my debt while keeping the payments within our means that would be great...for example, if I changed to a qualifying repayment plan any balance would be forgiven after ten years of repayment (2026). But I can't get any useful info from the feds on how payments would work under any of the income-contingent plans without going through the full application process with them.

investing,Howard Schultz on Retail,"I've said on this sub for a while now that we are entering the ""End of the Mall Era"". Some interesting discussion from Howard Schultz on the SBUX conference call the other day.

""But I think there's another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about three years ago, and that is the seismic shift in consumer traffic.

I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation at FedEx and he shared with me a piece of research which showed a significant drop in foot traffic on Main Street and in malls, not only domestically and around the world, as a result of e-commerce, the Web, and what I'll loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that, you're certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only not open new stores, but announce closures.

And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little long-winded but I think it's important. **There's no doubt that over the next five years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, and their omni-channel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure.** And as a result of that, there's going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape.

We believe, as we look down that pipe and look at the future, that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally, coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community, the third place environment, and people looking for and seeking out human contact and a place to go, that as these store closures occur, and they will, that we are going to be in a very unique position five years, 10 years down the road because there's going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I'm not talking about the coffee category; I'm talking overall.

But we are in the very, very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricks-and-mortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change in how people are buying things, and that's going to have, I think, a negative effect on all of retail. But we believe that it's going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores.""

I'll continue to want to stay away from the mall when it comes to investing - including mall-centric retailers and mall REITs.

personalfinance,"Light credit history, time to beef up my credit with an auto loan?","Hey PF!

Before everyone starts ragging on me about reading the FAQs before posting: I've gone through them, and haven't found anything related to my situation thus far.

Info about me: 22yr old car salesman, in NYC, own a Discover secured card (my only credit line) which I have been extremely responsible about since I've had it for the past few months, and I'm looking to get a motorcycle.

In the car industry, we know that mostly everyone bites the bullet on their first car. We all come in with light credit, finance with high APRs, then plan to refinance after a year to bring our rates back down to Earth.

I have a few issues I would love this sub's clarification on:

(1) I'm planning on purchasing a used motorcycle in the next few months, and I'm currently deciding whether to buy it out in cash, or finance it through an external lender.

(2) I have the cash to buy out a cheap bike a few times over so I know that I have the capacity to follow through on both my bike and insurance payments.

(3) Does it make sense for me to finance the bike as opposed to buying it out right?

(4) If I were to finance it, which bank should I go to for securing a loan?
 
(5) What kind of interest rates should I expect to get hit with (I've seen interest rates go as high as 20-25% for new car buyers)? 

(6) The main reason I would choose to finance over a cash deal is because I want to start building a strong history sooner (due to a big ticket purchase I plan on making within the next 5 years).

finance,Is quantitative easing the most effective approach to improve most people's financial situation during a downturn?,"QA has cost and benefits. On a high level it should lead to more lending by banks and keep inflation at a level where people don't start hoarding their money. I'm not sure about the costs but their have to be some negative effects, like low interest rates. One alternative to create economic activity would be to simply let the FED create and hand out some amount of money to everybody. Most people would spend a significant part of that right away, which would directly lead to economic growth. Such a measure should at least in theory end up devaluing the money already out there and thus increase inflation, which would be the cost of doing so.

personalfinance,How to mitigate damage from a late payment?,"Some background on my outstanding debt: I currently have a little over 10k in student loans (split between federal loans and a loan from the school that I attended), and also recently paid off a three-year car loan. Until recently, I had made complete and timely payments on all three of these, and my credit score was around 750.

I had autopay set up on my auto loan, and prior to my last payment, the financing corporation cancelled my autopay setup. I didn't realize this until after the fact (I was not notified that autopay was being turned off), and as soon as I realized, I submitted my final payment. This ended up being exactly 30 days after it was due, and the company has reported the payment as late; as a result, my credit score has dropped to just under 690.

I understand that in the long run, the damage from one late payment will be minimal, and that my score will have rebounded by about two years from now assuming I continue to make timely payments on my other loans (which I will). In the interim though, are there any proactive steps that I can take to try to restore my credit more quickly? I have written a letter to the financing corporation, explaining the circumstances of the late payment and asking them if they will remove it from my credit report out of goodwill, but I understand that they are under no obligation to do this and (based on what I have read from other customers of said company) probably won't. I will consider reaching out to the credit bureaus directly as well, but don't hold out much hope for this option. Assuming I have to eat this one (and consider it a lesson learned regarding autopayments), is there anything I can do to mitigate the damage to my credit?",finance,1478385427
personalfinance,Am I using Roth IRA incorrectly?,"Hi r/personalfinance! I've been reading here for a few months now and I have finally saved up $5,500 to put into my Roth IRA. I signed up with Vanguard last month and needless to say, I've been completely lost. I'm rather tech-savvy but utterly lost when attempting to navigate their website or understand exactly how I'm able to invest my money.

My money started in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, but nothing was happening to it, the website said 100% of my money was in ""short term reserves."" So I ended up putting my $5,500 into the Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund, and based on their allocation tool and advice to invest more aggressively while young (I'm 23) and more conservatively when older, I have my mix at 80% stocks and 20% bonds. I checked back a week later and my balance had increased by $20 ($5,520), I thought ""hey, that's really good, but I probably shouldn't expect most of that $20 if any to be there when I look again."" The next week I logged in and my balance was $40 less ($5,480) and I thought, ""well, the investment allocation I have is rather volatile, I'm going to have to keep a close eye on this and maybe readjust. My goal is to have a bit more money for retirement, not to make a ton of money.""

I logged into my account today, about two or three weeks later and saw [my balance below $5,400](https://i.imgur.com/DBk9sfC.png).

I can take the $100 or so loss, it's the price of learning. The worst case scenario is that I lose money **and** I don't learn anything. So, I have two questions:

* Am I doing this completely wrong? When I first put my money into Vanguard I was under the impression that I was going to basically choose an allocation and it'd be set. I've been very thrown off by all of these different ""fund names"" and ticker symbols.
* If I'm not doing this completely wrong, is my allocation as bad as I'm feeling it is? Or is this sort of fluctuation normal?",finance,1478388762

I have a 2014 Ford Focus that I bought in October 2015, which has an issue with the clutch where my car will buck. The dealership looked at it, determined the issue and is going to replace it for free because it's not anything I could have done; they aren't calling it a recall though. I just waited a month from knowing that before they finally gave me an appointment, scheduled for 9 days away from now. 
I took my car down a couple days ago for an inspection and I was told that my car would not pass because my front tires are so bald. My driver side tire also has wire showing on the inside of the tire. I was told to drive it as minimally as possible until I have the funds to purchase tires. I've been blessed by my amazing mother and I have an appointment for tomorrow to get new tires put on. My bigger issue here and what's making me question keeping the car is that I have an interest rate of 18.25% because my credit score when I bought it was nonexistent. I was told to refinance when my score built up a bit, but I have yet to feel that I'm at a ""good enough"" score to do that yet. I'm just unsure what to do. I don't want to throw money into something that essentially isn't worth it and I don't want to be stuck paying on a car I don't have anymore.

This guy said his company puts me in their debt reconciliation program. They begin to write letters to the debtors to remove the late payments showing up on my credit history. In the mean time, I stop making payments on my credit cards, then when it gets to 120 days the credit card companies charge off my accounts, collect their insurance money from my negligence, then they bundle my accounts and sell them off to collection agencies for pennies on the dollar. Then when it gets to that points is when I will start to receive notices from collection agencies so then I'm supposed to send those letters to his company they will then begin disputing the debts because legally they are not obligated to collect the debt. He said at the end of the program all of the debt collectors will have erased your debt and will no longer have dings on your credit report, and you will have excellent credit at the end of the program. The also provide an additional 2 years of service in the event some issues still remain on my credit which they will continue to fight.

Here is a breakdown of the current financial agreement and a 3% good interest rate that my friend got on his car of similar value with similar credit history. http://imgur.com/gl2hc9K


Obviously those numbers are slightly off as the more principal you pay the less interest there is. 

Since I purchased my car my credit score has gone up 2 points. Currently I am sitting at 546 (This number was 635 before Victory Chevrolet did a hard-pull through 19 loan agencies) with 0 missed payments. a 19 month car loan paid in full on time. a personal loan $1000, paid in full on time. a credit card of 7 months paid in full every month on time. Finally my current car 17 months paid on time. That is 40 months of credit history which is low.


I am at 18% on my car and that is WITH my dad cosigning my loan with me. I am 21 and make 50k a year and attend college 1 credit hour over full time for mechatronics engineering.

I cannot refinance my car through any bank as every time I have tried I was declined due to ""short credit history."" I have even tried my local credit union to which I have had an account for 7 years. Same story.


 I was thinking about getting a student loan for $20k as they carry much lower interest rates. I would think it would have to be a private loan as my actual school costs $1700 a semester. I also would lose my gap insurance on the car (although I need to find out if my insurance is tied to the loan or the car.)

I recently started a job in Illinois that offered a SURS pension, I'm in my mid 30s.

I would like to match or exceed the 7% with my investments.

In the link above are my options, it's an ok selection to choose from, not great. I've narrowed it down to 3 funds, the Fidelity Growth Commingled Pool, Fidelity 500 Index fund and the TIAA-Cref Large Cap Growth Index fund. I think they had the best combo of fees and returns. None of the bond, international or REIT choices impressed me and I will use my IRA account with Fidelity to diversity with those.

Fidelity Growth Commingled Pool- 5 year return of 15.3% with a fee of .71
Fidelity 500 Index fund- 5 year return of 12.5% with a fee of .05
TIAA-Cref Large Cap Growth Index fund- 5 year return of 13.3% with a fee of .06

personalfinance,Paying off student loans using Citibank's 2% cash back credit card.,"I currently have around 48k students loans (two of three is still in grace period, but building interest), and I want to pay back 3k a month, starting with the highest interest rate loan.

My main concern is, if I use up my credit card so much (probably 60-80% of its limit every month), will this affect my FICO score negatively? I know that part of your score depends upon how much of your total credit limit is being used.

personalfinance,I have to move out soon and want to know if my budget works,"Hello everyone. I am 23 years old and have been living with my parents for the last year while working my first job out of college. We live just south of Pittsburgh PA and I work just north of the city. My plan was to stay at home until I pay off my student debt but that plan has unfortunately changed. My parents are now getting a divorce and are planning to sell the house and split the money 50 50. While this will probably not be happening until March or April next year I would rather get my finances together as soon as I can. I have been looking around the area I live for apartments, and am planning on moving in with one of my good friends from home. Even still, I have no intention of moving out until January.

So, here are the numbers of my current budget. I make $22/h and get paid every 2 weeks. Net, I get $1,333 for a standard 2 week pay, so $2,666/mo. I am currently a temp/contractor at the place I work, but the job is pretty stable and it’s likely that I will get hired on permanently near the beginning of next year. The contract was also extended into next February as of 3 weeks ago. I currently have 2 separate student loans, a Sallie Mae loan of $16,675 I pay $243.64/mo on and a Federal loan of $25,991 I pay $295.59/mo for a total of $539.23/mo. Currently, I have been taking $550 out of each pay and setting it aside for loans. Through this I currently have about $16,000 in savings. I originally was going to take about half of that and put it down as a lump sum on the $16,000 loan, but I haven’t made the move on that yet as everything is now changing. I have a single credit card that I usually charge $250 to $300/mo which is made up gas and buying lunch at the work cafeteria. This leaves me with $486 a pay of which I keep $400 for myself as “Fun Money”. Even with that I rarely ever spend all of it, and when my next pay comes I put the remainder of usually $150 to $200 back into savings and reset myself to $400.

That is how I have been managing my money, so here is how I plan to do it when I move out. First things first, I want to maintain my saving for my loans so I plan to put away $1,000 a month to go towards them. I have received the advice that I should set aside 1/3 of my monthly income for apartment expenses so I plan to set aside $888 for that. That leaves me with $788 left over. My friend and soon to be roommate makes about $800 every 2 weeks so $1,600/mo and is currently interviewing for a few higher paying jobs. We talked it out and figured our maximum budget would be $500/mo each. Here is my first question though. Looking through the apartments in my area I am seeing mostly $800-$1,100/mo for a decent 2 bedroom apartment. The main difference being the $1,100 places generally list most of the utilities are included and the ones near the $800 end do not state anything on utilities. Can I assume that most of the lower cost places do not have utilities included, and if so with paying them would it bring us closer to evening out with the $1,100? I am hoping that all the utilities can be contained in the extra $338 after taking $550 out of the max apartment budget.

As for other expenses, I currently don’t have a car payment as I drive my dad’s Chevy Colorado to work. He has said that he has no intentions of taking the truck back since I need it as he has his company vehicle for work and an older van for personal use. Insurance wise I am expecting about $50/mo. The credit card right now is $300/mo but I think I can reduce that by cooking bulk meals at the start of the week thus eliminating the cost buying the expensive work lunches and feeding myself for dinner. For this I figure my roommate I and can each chip in about $100/ month for food and both cook a bulk meal a week and share and alternate them for that week. That will leave me with about $428 left over after that. We don’t plan on getting cable, just internet. From what I have heard from friends is that their internet costs them a little over $50/mo. We will be splitting that so Ill set aside $30 for that. Finally I am expecting to pay about $50 a month for insurance. Over all this still leaves me with $393 to myself.

So to summarize and a TLDR:

I am looking to move out of my parents’ home to an apartment in the south hills area of Pittsburgh. I will be splitting living costs with a roommate and we are looking for apartments in the $800-$1100 range

My monthly budget is as follows:

$2,666 – net monthly income

$16,000 - current savings 

$16,675 – Sallie Mae student loan

$25,991 – federal student loan

Expenses / mo :

$1,000 – student loans

$888 – apartment and utilities (split)

$300 – credit card bill / food and gas (food is split)

$50 – car insurance

$30 – internet (split)

$5 – Netflix (split)

$393 – personal money

Main Questions:

The cheaper apartments don’t include utilities while the more expensive ones do. Can we expect to pay close to the max of $1,100/mo overall no matter where we live?

What expenses am I not taking into account, and what modifications can I make to account for them?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. While the situation I’m moving out under may not be ideal for me, I am excited to get out on my own and start this new chapter of my life.",finance,1478457820

personalfinance,"25K raise in 2 months, 24 Y/o.","I am in the first year of my career post college. I took the second job I interview for, it was a contract to hire position, the contract period was suppose to last 6 months making 16 an hour going to 42,500 for full time. My contract period ended up lasting 10 months due to one blunder in my first month of the job.

When I first started the company the team was massively overworked. I got thrown in the the fire, I was tasked with a report from a member leaving the company, he was checked out as he was training me on his second to last day. I botched the report... twice... trying to fix it little the help of another new employee. My manager reviewed the directions and admitted they sucked. So we went over the report together. The 3rd try... I copy and pasted only A-P and left the rest of the data off. I fucked up. This blunder made my manager lose all faith in.

The next 8 months I did everything perfectly and took on every new responsibility presented, all the while my manager treated me as less than human. I did not start looking for another job hard until 9 months into my contract period (stupid I know) but for 3 months she kept saying we will review your work on our next one on one. I liked the job, my co-workers and I was learning new stuff everyday so I did not want another job. But the manager would not give me the full time position, every time we met it was the same story, no reason why I would not get the full time position, just we will review next month. At month 9 I realized I was never going to get the job. So I started looking.

In 2 months our team lost 6 of the 15 team members (voluntary), while all this was going on I was still a contractor and was getting fed up with not getting the position especially as I took on 2 full time employees' responsibilities.

After month 9s one on one I did not get the full time offer I asked the second in command if I could use him as a reference as it seems that I would never get the job. He and all my team members were out raged, as they worked with me everyday and vouched for my profusely, the second in command said of course and he too did not understand why she did not offer me the position. I got the full time position one week later. Yay 10k raise, that was 1 month ago.

I was so blown about how I was treated I kept looking for a new job, here is the good news. Went on 5 interviews, and had my choice, one company came back with an awesome offer. 57,500 with awesome benefits. I am taking the offer.

I went from making 32,000 for 10 months, 4 months longer than it should have been only because my boss ""did not trust me"" (yes, she said this to me in an email and to the other employee), I have been making full time money 42,500 for 1 month, but now have accepted the new position for  57,500.

It will be bitter sweet leaving, I have the best co-workers and boy/man could ask for, but the 10 months my boss kept me in purgatory makes the decision easy. BUT I AM PUMPED",finance,1478462088

1 - If they pay it directly from their account can they claim this in their tax return and get money back (ie does it count as a gift or as a mortgage/loan payment which is eligible for a tax refund).

2 - If they put the money on my bank account and I pay it myself, can i claim it for a tax refund?

3 - Are there any major drawbacks to paying off a loan with 1 big payment? Given that its a variable interest and that the fed is considering raising rates in the future does it offset any potential penalties.

I looked into the debt and it is $2,700 owed to a collection agency. I went to beauty school in 2014 and owe $11,000 in federal loans, however, the school billed me for ""over time"" when I took an extra month to graduate.

Relevant background info to assess my strategy:

- Base salary is $204k, housing allowance $48k, and annual bonus $15k
- Base and bonus rise about $10k each year
- Will be living very frugally, and my main living expenses will be food, utilities, and transportation
- The Fed Perkins loan is in the grace period until  3/2017, meaning as long as I pay it fully before 3/2017, I just pay the $8000 and no interest
- For all the other loans, the grace period/forbearance period (I have a mix) ends in about a week, at which point all the interest accrued will be added to the principal.
- Average interest rate: 6.79%

**Proposed Strategy [** Separated so you can just comment on one, or all!  Seriously, any expertise appreciated **]**

*1. The Federal Perkins loan*

Since I have until March of next year to pay this before any interest is added, and because in the grand scheme of my loans $8000 isn’t much, I’m going to keep the Federal Perkins loan separate from all the other soon-to-be refinanced loans.  I’ll pay it off sometime before March using my Discover card to get points then pay the card off immediately.  (Unfortunately they don’t accept visa, otherwise I’d definitely use my CSR).

*2. Paying off some interest before capitalization using CSR*

I only have about a week before the grace/forbearance period for all the rest of the loans ends.  Any interest that I don’t pay by off by November 17 will be added to the principal.  I have about $4000 that I can afford to pay right now.  The plan is to put all of it towards the interest on the Grad Plus loan with 7.9% interest rate using my Chase Sapphire Reserve card.  Tip I learned: MyGreatLakes accepts credit card payments as long as you call over the phone.  For the CSR lovers, you’ll know this means I’ll have hit the magic $4000 and get my bonus!  Again, will pay off card immediately.

*3. Refinancing remaining $208k loans*

Didn’t know what refinancing meant a week ago, so thanks reddit for enlightening me.  I have applications in for Earnest, Sofi and Common Bond.  I’m going to wait to see what their final rates are for me, then pick the best offer.  Some people seem to have had success playing the companies against each other to get lower rates (ie screenshotting and sending your lower Earnest rate to Sofi to get a counter), so I’ll try this as well.  I’ve already weeded out DRB and Citizens Bank because the rates they quoted me were absurdly high compared to the others.  For perspective: Common Bond quoted 2.78% for variable 7 year loan and Earnest quoted 3.99% for fixed 5 year, 3.04 for variable 5 year.  Of course these are just quotes based on the information I provided, but I expect the actual offer won’t vary much.

Regardless, since my current average interest is 6.79% and any of the options would bring me down around 3 points refinancing seems like a no-brainer.  But correct me if I’m wrong.

*4. Selecting the variable rate*

Putting this separately from #3 since I think some people might have differing thoughts on the fixed vs. variable strategy and am curious to hear.
 I think I’m going to do the variable over fixed.  Just going off SoFi’s quote:
- Fixed 3.990% interest rate, 7 year term, $3,011 monthly payment
- Variable 3.165% interest rate, 7 year term, $2,879 monthly payment

I realize that variable is more risky.  But given my 4 year (3 if ambitious) timeline, I don’t think LIBOR (although slightly increasing) will rise enough to justify picking the fixed over variable.  Also, the variable rate on Sofi is capped at 8.95%, which is a nice protection mechanism.  Lastly, my job is stable so I feel comfortable taking on the risk—so to me, it’s worth the risk.  But very interested in your thoughts.  I’m picking a 7 year term over a 5 year term because even though slightly higher interest rate, I like the comfort and flexibility of having a lower monthly payment.

*5. Savings and Budget*

I’ve created an excel sheet to keep a fairly strict budget until I pay off my loans. Anything that isn’t going towards retirement or allocated budget will go towards my loans, which means I’ll ideally be overpaying the minimum every single month.

I don’t think it makes sense to have an ‘emergency fund’ of 3-6 months salary as they recommend while I still have these loans.  Instead, I’m going to have a $2000 emergency fund.  I figure that if something bad happens, $2000 is just enough to move out, fly home and live with my parents.  Thoughts?

personalfinance,Can private student loan increase interest rate without notification?,"Hello,

I took out a private student loan from a company called My Rich Uncle.  That company then went bankrupt and the debt is now listed with Younomics.  I'm assuming that means they purchased the debt and are a collector.  That loan has been at 10.25% interest rate and, without informing me, the loan is now listing at 10.5%.  All information I received from then is done via an online portal and there is no notice from them about the interest rate changing.

Caveat: I am a CPA and do some investing for myself based on the awesome advice in PF. So don't feel the need to 'ELI5' if you don't want to. This question is for my brother, who is a Junior at the Air Force Academy in CO, USA.

He has the opportunity to receive the ""Cadet Starter Loan"" through USAA. Some info on the loan can be found here: http://the-military-guide.com/how-to-smartly-use-the-usaa-career-starter-loan/

I've already talked to him how he doesn't HAVE to take the loan at all, but that it's just an exclusive benefit that he has the choice to use. He still wants to use it. He can receive a loan up to $36k. Payments are deferred until after graduation. He will be receiving an officer's salary upon graduation, which I believe will be around $40k (correct me if I'm way off) with very few expenses. He has no other debt. This leads me to believe that he would have no trouble repaying the loan payments once they kick in.

For the purposes of my question, his initial plan is to take the loan of $36k and he's already told me the interest rate will be locked at 0.75%. He's paying our dad back $2k for a car, and keeping $16k easily accessible. The other $18k, he wants to invest, with the plan to not withdraw from those investments for 5+ years.

What recommendations does PF have for how he should allocate his funds (the easily accessible $16k and the 5+ years invested $18k)?",finance,1478544056

Need Advice!","First time posting on reddit but heard this may be a helpful place to get advice. Here are my demographics:

- Male

- Married, partner makes $75,000/year as well. They are 14 years older and have pension and life-insurance set up already. No other retirement savings at this time. 

- We have a mortgage on our house (in partner's name) but are about $40,000 underwater ($150,000 at 4% and $30,000 at 2% left on the house)

- Have about $70,000 in student debt, non-consolidated, averaging out to about 4.5% interest. I graduated with about $120,000 in debt but have been paying down as much as possible on the higher interest rate loans in the past 3 years. 

- No credit card debt and car is paid off.

- Contacted an agent at an insurance company (not sure if I can name names here) for disability insurance as I am self-employed and would be in trouble if I didn't have protection. I set up disability insurance for $155/month. I was then talked into investing in an overfunded life insurance policy that would become a retirement savings account for me to yield minimum returns of 7%. I've been paying around $1,000/month for this (with 1mil benefit) and am doubtful that this is the best retirement savings option for me.

My questions are:

- Should I be saving less in this overfunded account/retirement and paying down student debt or home mortgage instead? 

- I would like to have life insurance for my partner in case something does happen to me. Should I be financing a term life insurance plan instead or another option? 

- Are overfunded life insurnace policies a good option for someone in my income bracket/situation? I've only been paying the premium for 2 months and would be ok to back out this soon into the game if necessary. 

- Are there other, better investment options for me?

personalfinance,"36 y/o with zero savings, zero plan, no clue what to do next.","Throwaway because this friends use reddit and this is humiliating to discuss.  

36 Y/O male, single.  Job in tech, roughly 4 years at current position.  Salary is between 105k and 110k per year (fluctuation comes from bonuses).  
No mortgage, no student loans.  Roughly 40k in stock (all from work bonuses, 1/2ish vested). 

Now for the bad stuff:    

Only started contributing to 401k with this job, so retirement is close to non-existant, but i am maxing out my company matching.  Savings:  non existant.  Have four CC at around 90% utilization, right around 40k in debt (some are on 0% interest, others are not).  One car, used, roughly 12k left to pay.    
Bills are regular utilities, internet, some TV services, cellphone, car loan, insurance, and CC.  
Job security is solid (at least it seems that way; anything can happen at any time, of course).  
I have never learned how to save, and never learned budget as I've always earned right around or above what my peers were earning, so spending what those around me spent was always doable without living paycheck to paycheck.    

Last long term relationship crumbled because of finances; She was very thrifty, I am obviously not.  Never felt comofortable getting past dating since then, primarily due to the fact that the type of women I date always seem to be very nice, very responsible women who value fiscal responsibility and I really cannot let myself get back into a relationship until I fix this.  

I recently started saving (what does that even mean!?) but have no clue how to get rid of my debt and save and build a five year plan.  

While I feel young, I'm very aware that I'm not.  By any stretch.  And I'm starting to panic.  I recently met someone that I care about, but I can already feel myself getting into the same mode of getting distant as we get closer and conversations about finances feel inevitable.   

Not asking for relationship advice, but:  How do I undo everything I did (or rather, didn't do) in the past 10 years?  My credit has zero negative anything on it; I always pay towards my credit cards, usually multiple times a month, but at the very minimum I pay the min. due.  Regardless, my credit is pretty rough due to the 90+% util.  

I've looked at the sub for advice, but most of it is geared towards people like me but in their 20s, or people my age who have nowhere near the amount of wreckage to deal with that I have.    
I read the ""35-45"" section in the side bar and almost barfed.  It feels like I may never realistically get to a point where any of that is achievable.  

I'm writing in the hopes of finding some sort of strategy.  Things like packing lunch and getting rid of TV is a great start, but isn't realistically going to be enough to fix anything.  ""Save aggressively"" is also good, but without a tangible strategy I always feel pretty lost doing this (I've tried, many many times).  

Anyway, that's my story.  This is probably the first time I've gotten any of these thoughts down on paper or even said them to anyone, so even if this post gets removed or buried, I think just writing it is a good start.

personalfinance,I let my credit cards get out of control while hoarding cash for a down payment on a house. Now I'm ready to take control and fix it. How should I proceed?,"​Hey Reddit, long time lurker, occasional poster, using a throwaway for anonymity (nobody wants to accidentally some day be the next Ken Bone and have their dirty laundry aired).

My fiance and I bought a house three months ago and during the process of selling my own place over the last two years, I unfortunately fell into the trap of trying to keep cash on hand for the 20% down payment on the $210k house without cutting back my spending, and living above my means. I knew I had the option of putting 20% down on the house or paying off my mounting debt, but I opted to avoid paying PMI on the house.  Long story short, I racked up just north of $20k in credit card debt over three cards.  I have started by taking the credit cards out of my wallet and removed them from all of online shopping sites where they had previously been saved.  The only exception to this is my card that gives 5% cash back for gas/groceries, which I use to charge them and before I even leave the store I submit an online payment for however much money I just spent.  I'm trying to devise the best way to consolidate these payments into something more manageable, where interest isn't destroying me.  

**Credit Cards:**

1. Barclay $9,719 - 21.24% - $276/month
2. Discover $9,805 - 20.24% - $280/month
3. Chase $2,785 - 13.49% - $75/month

**Other monthly expenses:**

1. $261 car payment  - 1.75% interest. I'm putting this car up for sale within the next month; I was given an old Honda by my father with 400k miles that runs like a top and is completely paid off.  I'll also save around $20-30 extra per month by not owing insurance on this car.
2. $1000 mortgage - 3.75% interest (includes taxes &amp; insurance)
3. $70 refrigerator payment - 0% interest.  Have 33 months left on 0% interest financing and it will be paid off by the deadline
4. $440 student loan - 6.75% interest.  This just went up by nearly $100/month and I'm considering asking them to lower it again if possible
5. $60 Internet &amp; Netflix.  No cable
6. $45 cell phone

**My income &amp; assets**

1. $1731.55 net bi-weekly (just got a raise with an extra $78/check, which I plan to put straight to debt payments)
2. $4800 in cash
3. $7000 Roth IRA
4. Credit score is 715 currently

In addition, we have a finished third floor in our home that we will be renting out come January, which should bring in around $750/month, all of which will go toward paying debt down.  My fiance is in law school, thankfully on scholarship, but she does not have any income at this time and is not permitted to work during her first year of school.  She helps out with bills here and there with some money she's saved.  I should also mention, her parents are taking care of paying for our wedding next year, so while I will still have some small expenses for that, the lion's share of it will not be on us.  My job still offers a pension program (government employee) so I am still contributing to retirement savings, though not as much as I would like to be able to afford.

**Options (so far)**

* My credit union offered me a five year, unsecured loan of $10,000 at 10.49% APR.  The monthly payments would be $231, but I could pay extra once the other high interest credit card was paid off.  There is a negligible $50 penalty if I pay it off before 2 1/2 years have passed.  
* Lightstream offers [8.29% - 13.79%](https://www.lightstream.com/rates-loan-calculator) interest loans in the dollar amount that I'm looking at, plus no origination fee.  This is a fixed term, 60 month loan with no early payment penalty.  I meet the requirements for a loan from them, but have not formally applied yet.

I know it's a risky venture taking more loans to pay off credit cards, but we have changed our thinking about money and are ready to take control of our finances, living more frugally and hammering away at this debt.  What can I do to get my money right, Reddit?  The interest rates on the two bigger credit cards are killing me.

personalfinance,Help. Student Loan that went into Collection. What should I do? Consolidate?,"Got a notice from a collection company that they have received a debt from my school and were there to, well, collect. I am hugely at fault for this, it was something I neglected and kept putting off until the school/payment agency gave my debt to the collection company to handle, and that was a huge wake up call for me I guess. I gave them a call and said that I really only had two options, either:

1. Pay the debt in FULL now 

 or

2. Consolidate that debt with my FedLoans (which I already filed for deferment due to hardship e.g. unemployment) 

The debt the collection agency is asking from me amounts to roughly $7,000. I can't do option 1 (pay in full), but I did ask them if they had an installment plan, in which they did. From what I understand, ""Rehabilitation"" is paying off in either 3, 6, or 9 month installments, but having no sufficient employment/income yet, I'm still not sure if I can do that at the moment. And they said they're very strict with that program regarding late payments/bounced checks. 

Anyway, the specialist then really pushed for consolidation that would combine this $7,000 debt with my FedLoans and that they (FedLoans) will be the one to handle it thereafter. Coming from her it sounded like the right way to go, but I still wanted to do some research before going with any decision. 

Is there a way out of collection? If I consolidate, will it just be deferred with the rest of my FedLoans, or do I have to specifically deal with that one first?

personalfinance,[Auto] I would like to transfer car with financing remaining to a family member. Any advice?,"Hey everyone!

First off, thanks for taking the time to read this post -  This is my first time posting on here.

So, as the title states, I'd like to essentially ""transfer"" the vehicle that I own and am currently paying off to my mother. She has been looking for a vehicle and I am potentially about to join the vehicle-search market myself. I'd like to keep this as painfree as possible, but to lay out the outline of the situation:

****
**The Vehicle**

*  2013 US-OEM Small - SUV
* Full Safety Features (Forward Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Park Assists, Blind Spot)
* 75k miles
* Very well maintained (All major components inspected at every oil change)
* No maintenance issues (yet) (Minor concern about fluids in PTU)
* KBB Value: ~$20,000 (to buy), $18,000 (to sell)
* Financing remaing: $17,400 
* Interest Rate: 3.9% (Credit score has risen nearly 200 points since this was set up)

****

**The situation**

In short, my mother has been looking for a new vehicle for a looong time. She has a 20 year old mini-van that is on its last leg. Multiple repair shops and OEM facilities have inspected and said it is NOT safe to drive above 55mph due to multiple issues. Its KBB is barely above scrap at $1k. 

Unfortunately, her financial situation has not allowed her to upgrade. While she has a good job that pays well, she has not been able to rebuild her credit score in any way and is having a very tough time with financing a (new) used vehicle or a lease.

Based on her budget, we calculated $320-$350 / month being a reasonable target. My current monthly payments on my loan are $430, but I have been paying over this to keep it in the black with my ~35k miles / year driving. If I were to refinance my loan back up to 5 years, it would drop the payments to around $320. 

The other advantage of a used car over the lease is the lower insurance costs. The vehicle does have the safety features that some (maybe all? I'm not sure) insurance companies allow to lower premiums. *Side note!!*  As a software engineer in the auto industry, I am also a huge advocate of these systems and am trying to push her into only vehicles that have these systems.

****
**The questions**

What do we need to consider to do something like this? Can I simply transfer the title to her? Will she need to pay taxes on the ""purchase"" of this? Declare the value as a gift?

I'd also like to help her build her credit, so is it easy enough to refinance the loan into her name (applying with me as the co-signer potentially)?

Personally, I am perfectly OK transferring this to her at no cost. My lifestyle is unfortunately pushing me towards a bigger SUV (long camping trips with kayaks, bikes, dogs, girlfriend!), so it seems to make more sense for us, as a family, to keep this perfectly fine vehicle and only search for 1 vehicle between the two of us.

What are everyone's thoughts about doing something like this? Anyone performed something similar? Or am I possibly looking at this all wrong?

Credit cards are free as long as you pay them on time plus you get purchase protection and perks! Maybe with a secure credit card you'd need put down a deposit but you'd have to do the same thing with a credit builder loan anyway plus you'd be paying interest!

So what is the point in getting a credit builder loan at all? Seems to me that credit cards are way better.",finance,1478576308

This is a continuation from the previous reddit post:

[Bitcoin Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5aflch/bitcoin_origins/)

The following are a few notes I've been making on the original development of the tech behind Bitcoin.

This is still in early draft form so expect the layout and flow to be cleaned up over time.

Also be aware that the initial release of the Bitcoin white paper and code was what we had cut down to from earlier ideas.

This means that some of the ideas below will not correspond to what would end up being made public.

As I'm paraphrasing dim memories some of the sections are out-of-order whereby some things occurred earlier rather than later.  As I recall more I'll be updating this story elsewhere for uploading when it appears more substantial.

As noted on the first post ( link supplied above ):

There is no verification of truth here.

There is absolutely no evidential proof that I had any part in the project.

Take this as just a fictional story if you wish.

*Six Months In A Leaky Boat*

continued ...

“You’re saying that we can use this proof-of-work thing to inject electronic cash into the network and have it tied to fiat currencies, but how would the network know what the local fiat currency is to figure out the correct fiat-currency-to-electronic-cash exchange rate ?”, (2) asked.

“Maybe we could have a server that keeps a record of what the various electricity companies charge and have the software get the values from there ?”, I suggested.  “Some of these new mobile phones, the smart phones, the cellular network phones in folks pockets, have GPS chips incorporated into them, right ?  And everyone has them or will be getting them as they become more popular.  This means everyone will have a device on them which will allow the software to include a GPS location so that the network knows which exchange rate to use for that particular minted cash.

“But how will the network know that the GPS coordinates haven’t been changed and set to another location ?”, (2) asked. “Wouldn’t that mean relying on a trusted third party again ?  I thought you said we have to get away from that ?  If we cannot trust a single computer for minting cash into the network then maybe we shouldn’t trust any at all ?”

“Uhh… dunno,” I replied. “I’ll get back to that later”, I said.

“Ok, ” (2) said.  “How are we going to have the transactions sent to other people on the network ?  All the other white papers are expecting people to connect directly to one of the trusted computers to purchase the electronic cash and to transfer it to someone else through them.  If we’re not going to use a trusted computer for this and will have the proof-of-work generate the cash, then how do people receive or pay the cash ?  Also: How would the network trust that the cash is valid if no computer is being used for time-stamping and validating the cash ?”

I told him I’d have to think about it.

Multiple ideas were given and discarded.  He consulted with (3) about every possible solution and every one was a failure.

They either resulted in having to rely on at least one server to hook everything together or would break if multiple transaction messages were sent at the same time to different computers.

After a week or so of this I’d finally burnt myself out and decided that it’s quite possible that everyone else was correct when they said that you couldn’t solve double-spending in a digital world without depending upon a trusted third party.

I stopped emailing (2) at that point, hoping it’d all go away.

After a week he emailed me asking if I’d come up with another solution for testing.

I told him that I don’t think there is a solution and maybe he should just use part of what he had in his original white paper and rely on a trusted third party like everyone else.

He said something along the lines of “Like [redacted] I will !  You’ve taken me down this path of not trusting a single computer and that’s what I want.  No-one's done that before and if we break it, it will probably change everything ! ”

I told him I’m taking a break from it all for a while.

Another week passes and he emails me again.

He said, “How are you feeling ?  Sorry to be so harsh on you but I really need this to work.  I’ll leave you be if that’s what you want.  Just let me know when you’re able to continue.”

Another week goes by and whenever I begin to think of the problem I just say to myself “To [redacted] with him and his electronic cash problem.”

For comfort I turn to perusing through some of my old Win32 Asm proggys (I called them “proggys” because I thought of them as small, incomplete computer programs - kind of like examples and tutorials).

I also begun reminiscing about the Amiga 500 days and the proggys I made back then (late 1980’s through to mid 1990’s).

Knowing that one of the most difficult issues with electronic cash revolved around the networking architecture and how data would be propagated by the networked computers I began going through some of the discussions I had back in 2005 and 2006 with someone who was attempting to make a tank game.

I explained to him the main difference between TCP and UDP ( [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) ).

If you need data packages to arrive in a particular order with confirmation that they’ve arrived then you’d use TCP.

If you need velocity of data packets you can throw all the protocol error checking out and use UDP.

That’s one of the reasons great online multi-player games uses UDP.  It reduces the latency with the data being transmitted around the network.

The main difficulty is in building the gaming system in such a way so that the data the servers and clients transmit and receive work when data packets never arrive.

TCP guarantees delivery if the network is functioning while with UDP you do not know if a particular packet ever arrived or if packets arrived in a different order to transmission due to separate packets traversing the internet via different pathways.

Many online games were usually built for single-player first and the multi-player code would be chucked into the codebase near the end of development.

This would mean that all of the game code objects and classes were made to use known values at any particular time and could not work in a UDP environment without re-architecting the entire code base from scratch.

You’d find many of the games that also included multi-player gameplay options ended up using TCP for the network communications and this made all of these games slow over the network with high latency and unplayable lag as the gameplay would be faster than the network data packets telling your computer where your opponents are located.

The various tanks games around 2005 were built as above.  I convinced this person to focus on the multi-player aspect of the game because he could always add in single-player later on.

Multiple players would have to drive and fire tanks around a field while being updated continuously about the complete state of the network.

This is usually accomplished by having a single server that receives all of the current data from all the player clients and dishes out the official game state back to all of those player clients so that everyone knows who went where, who fired at what and who has been hit.

However even with using UDP there is a bottleneck in the network with the server itself only being able to process a peak number of connections and data throughput every second.  It could only scale so high.

We had talked about different ways to improve this by possibly having relay servers on some of the players computers or having a more peer-to-peer like structure so that each player client only had to get the latest data from its nearest neighbours in the network and only transmit to their peers so that a fully server-less multi-player game could be created.

How the data could be moved about without someone creating a hack that could change the data packages in their favour couldn’t be figured out.

In the end he went with using a central server with both TCP and UDP depending upon what data packages were needed to be sent - general gameplay data (tank movements) via UDP and server state (for confirming who hit what) via TCP.

If a peer-to-peer network was to be used for electronic cash then to be scalable the data packages must be able to be transmitted with as high a velocity as possible. It must work with the majority of transmissions using UDP.

If two-way communication is required then a return ip/port can be included within a UDP data package or a TCP connection could be used.

I had also read and reread this thing that has been going around the crypto community for ages called the Byzantine Generals Dilemma (or worded in a similar way).

It’s supposed to be impossible to solve and at least a couple of well-known academics and crypto folks had “proven” it was impossible to solve only a few years previously.  They had pretty much staked their reputations on the fact that it was unsolvable.

I thought “Wouldn’t it be absolutely hilarious if the solution to this double-spending problem is also the solution to the impossible Byzantine Generals Dilemma and could be found using ideas from the Amiga days and 3D programming and uses multi-player gaming techniques ?  That would annoy the [redacted] out of the crypto community and take those elitists down a peg or two !”

(This is where you’d see the screen go all watery-wavy as the scene morphs to a time in the past when I was a moderator of the Win32 Asm community)

The assembly community and the crypto community share a lot in common.

They’re made up of some of the most brilliant folks in the computing industry where huge egos do battle against one-another.

You’d also find folks in one community existing within the other.

Both communities are made up of both light and dark actors.

The light actors are those who are very public.

They are academics, researchers, security professionals, and so on.

The dark actors are …  (and that’s all I’ll say about them).

Except to say that the light crypto actors are usually doing work to undo what the dark assembly actors are doing.

It’s one [redacted] of a game !

To have a message board that was able to accommodate all actors required a few tough rules and stiff execution of them if the forum was to continue to exist.

Many of the other assembly boards were being snuffed out by government actors forcing the hosting service to shut them down.

This was mainly due to the assembly forums insistence of allowing threads to exist which showed exactly how to break and crack various websites/ networks/ software/ etc.

Whenever one of these sites were shut down the members would disperse to the various remaining assembly boards.

So we received an influx of new members every few months whenever their previous venue went up in smoke.

However they never learned from the experience ( or, at least,  some of them never learned ) and they would continue to openly chat about dark subjects on *our* board, which put our board in danger as well.

The moderators had to be strong but fair against these new-comers, especially knowing that they (the moderators) could be actively attacked (digitally) at any time.

Occasionally one of these new members would decide to DDOS ( Distributed Denial Of Service ) us, however they apparently forgot what message board they were attempting to DDOS, and it always ended very badly for them.

We would also occasionally get someone with quite a bit of knowledge in various subjects - some of it very rare and hard-to-come-by.  It would be terrible if that member left and took their knowledge with them.

They would complain that there were too many noobs asking questions on the message board and it would be better if there was a higher level of knowledge and experience needed before the noobs could enter the message board or post a question.

Once I told one of these members, “Ok then.  Let’s say that thing you’ve been talking about for the past two weeks, and calling everyone else a noob for not understanding it, is the knowledge limit.  I know that you only first read about it two and a half weeks ago.  Let’s say I make that the limit and predate it three weeks ago and kick your butt out of this community ?""

“That’s not very fair”, he protested.

I told him, “None of us know where the next genius is coming from.  The main members of this community, the ones that input more than everyone else, have come from incredibly varied environments.  Some with only a few weeks knowledge are adding more to the community every week compared to members who have been with us for years.  One of the members you’ve dissed in the past couple of weeks could in turn create the next piece of software that all of us use.  We don’t know that.  What we need to do is have a community that is absolutely inclusive for every single person on the planet no matter where they’ve come from, what their wealth is, what their nation state does, and to keep our elitism in check.”

“Ok, fair enough, I’m sorry, please don’t kick me out.” was the usual result.

These were very intelligent folks, however they had to be reminded that we are a single species moving through time and space together as one.


(This is where you’d see the screen go all watery-wavy as the scene morphs back to me figuring out this double-spending problem)

As you may tell, I don’t tolerate elitist attitudes very well.

Which also helped when I turned towards the elitist attitudes I read in some of these academic papers and crypto white papers ( some of which were more like notes than white papers ) and messages on the crypto forums and mailing lists.

“ ‘*It’s impossible to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem*’ they say ? Let’s see about that !”

**Byzantine General’s Dilemma**

The problem is written a little bit differently depending upon where you read it.

An occasional academic may be more well-read than others and becomes the “official” wording used by many others.

I’ll paraphrase it a wee bit just so you get a general idea of the problem (pun intended).

We go back to the time of the city-states.

This is before the notion of sovereign states - there’s just a bunch of individual city-states that control the surrounding nearby country side.

Every so often a bunch of these city-states would get together and form something called an empire.

Alliances would change and friends would become enemies and enemies friends on a month-to-month and year-to-year basis.

To expand the empire the bunch of city-states would send armies controlled by generals to take over an adjacent city-state.

These city-states are huge (for their time) walled cities with armies in strong fortifications.

Let’s say there are six generals from six empire city-states that surround an adjacent city-state - all generals and their armies are equidistant from each other.

They cannot trust one another because at any moment one of them may become an enemy.  Or they could be an enemy pretending to be a friend.

Due to the defensive forces of the defending city-state, the six generals know that they could take the city if every one of them attacked at the same time from around the city.

But if only a few attacked and the others retreated then the attackers would be wiped out and the surviving city-states, with their generals and their armies intact,  would end up over-powering and enslaving their previous friendly city-states.

No-one could trust any other.

(This has massive parallels with modern day sovereign nations and their playing of the game with weapons, armies/air forces/navies, economics, currency, trade agreements, banks, education, health, wealth, and so on)

The generals have to send a message to the other generals telling them if they’re going to attack or retreat.

The problem is that a general could send a message to the general to his left saying that he’ll attack and send a second message to the general to his right that he will retreat.

Some possible solutions said that there should be two lieutenants to receive the message from the general and that they could check each others message to confirm that they are indeed identical before passing the messages onto the left and right messengers.

However the messengers in turn could change the message from “attack” to “retreat” or vice versa or not deliver the message at all.

Plus the generals, once a message has been sent out as “attack” could turn around and retreat, or vice versa.

I thought to myself, “I bet the folks who thought up this problem are feeling pretty damn smug about themselves.”

However I was a moderator of an assembly community.

I’d translated the DirectX8 C++ COM headers into their x86 assembly equivalent (using techniques built by others far more smarter than me, and with help for some files when DX8.1 was translated), built a PIC micro controller assembler in x86 assembly language, and many other things.

And because I've done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with creating a solution to the Byzantine Generals Dilemma !

Elitist ego ? What elitist ego ? They’re all amateurs !

Let us begin:

“Ok,” I thought to myself.  “let’s start at the beginning.  We need a network.  What does that look like ?”

The Generals are going to be represented as computers.  The servers in the network. The nodes.

The messages are going to be the data travelling between them.

Transactions will be used as the first example of data.

For those reading, hold your hands in front of you - touch the bottom of the palms together with the fingers far apart, thumbs touching each other, twist your elbow and wrists so that the fingers are pointing upwards - slightly curved.

[Fingers as Nodes](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/fingers-as-nodes.jpg)

These are the nodes in the network.

The node where the thumbs touch is your own node.

No node can trust each other.

For this network structure to work, it must work even with every single node actively hostile toward one another.

“Surely the network can trust my node. I’m good ! “, you may say to yourself.

But you would be wrong.

This network is not about you.  It must exist even when you don’t.

If there were a hundred nodes then it’d be ninety-nine to one against you.

As far as the network is concerned, there’s ninety-nine nodes that cannot trust you compared to your one.

So accepting that all nodes cannot trust one another, plus they are actively hostile toward one another, we can …

“But hang on ! ”, you say. “What do you mean ‘actively hostile’ ?  Surely they’re not all hostile ? ”

Even if most of the time nodes will play nice with one another, the rules of the game must be structured in such a way that they will work *even if all participants were actively hostile toward one another* .

Because if it still worked with everyone having a go at each other then you would’ve built something that could last for a very long time.

You could build something whereby sovereign nations could no-longer undermine other sovereign nations.

It would be the great equaliser that would allow stronger nations to stop screwing around with weaker nations.

It’s the ultimate golf handicapping system.  Everyone could play this game.

Kind of like my moderating style from the assembly days.

So we have these hostile nodes.

It has to be able to work with any type of message or data package.  Initially it will be built for electronic cash transactions.

I will type it as ""messages (transactions)"" below to indicate that the messages are the messages in the Byzantine Generals Dilemma and that the message could be any data whatsoever - ""transactions"" just being the first.  Plus in a roundabout way a message is also a transaction whereby a transaction doesn't have to be only for electronic cash - it's just an indication of what items are being transacted.

We want to send messages (transactions) between them and make sure everyone agrees that the messages (transactions) are correct.

That implies that every single node would have to store an exact copy of all the messages (transactions) and be able to read through them and confirm that they are valid.

And whenever a node receives a message (transaction) it would check it for validity and if it’s ok then that message (transaction) would be passed onto the adjacent nodes.

But how to stop a node changing the message (transaction) contents and sending different results to two adjacent nodes ?

How about taking the possibility of messages (transactions) being able to be changed out of the problem completely ?

We could using private/public keys to sign the messages (transactions) so that they couldn’t be changed.

The owner could sign a message (transaction) with the owners private key and everyone could check its validity with the owners public key, but not be able to change it.

Right.  The messaging ( transactions/ data/ etc ) part of the problem is partially solved.

Now how do I solve the generals problem so that they all play nicely with one another ?

If we can make sure all generals (nodes) can get the identical data and that they can all validate that the data is identical and unchanged then the Byzantine Generals Dilemma would be solved.

**Data Chunks**

It became apparent that every major node on a network would have to store an entire copy of all of the data so that they could verify that the data was correct and hadn’t been modified.

The data would probably end up looking like a list or stack, with each incoming valid message (transaction) placed on top of the previous messages (transactions).

What looks like a stack but hasn’t got the memory restrictions like a normal assembly stack ?

When I was reminiscing about the Amiga 500 days I recalled having to muck about with IFF.

That’s the [Interchange File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_File_Format).

The basics of it is like this:

In a plain text file there are chunks of data.

Each chunk of data begins with a chunk identifier - four characters that indicate to a program what type of data resides within that chunk (example “WAVE”, “FORM”, “NAME”).

An IFF file can have many data chunks of differing types.

The .AVI (audio/video), .ILBM (bitmap) and .WAV (audio wave) file formats are based upon the IFF.

I thought, “What if one of these data chunks was called ‘MSG ’, ‘DATA’ or ‘TSTN’ (TranSacTioN) ? ”

That might work.

Where would the proof-of-work thing come into play ?

Let’s say we replace the four-character-identifier with a header so that the proof-of-work can be done on it ? 

That means the header would now include an identifier for what type of data is included within the chunk, plus a value used to modify the difficulty for generating a hash (the number of zeros needed to prepend the generated hash), a random value which increments as hashes are attempted so that the header data is slightly different for each hash attempt, plus the data itself.

But once a correct hash is generated, that particular node would mint electronic cash to pay for the electricity used.

Remember: The electronic cash is supposed to cover the actual fiat currency costs involved in doing the proof-of-work computations.

As the owner of the node computer is paid by an employer in fiat currency and has paid personal tax on it, and they have used that fiat currency to pay their electricity provider (which in turn pays company, state and value-added or goods&amp;service taxes), then the electronic cash is equivalent to swapping your own money for a soft drink can from a vending machine.

Except, due to the media of this system, you’d be able to go to another vending machine and reenter your soft drink can for a refund in fiat currency again ( minus a restocking fee ) and the vending machine could be anywhere on the planet.

That means an extra message (transaction) would have to be included within the chunks data for the minted electronic cash.

If there must be at least two messages (transactions) within a data chunk - the actual message (transaction) plus the message (transaction) for the node that generates the hash - then maybe there could be more messages (transactions) stored in each data chunk ?
How would a bunch of messages (transactions) be stored inside a data chunk ?

I remembered learning about binary space partitioning around 2006.

BSP trees were used to store 3D graphic polygons that were able to be quickly traversed so that a game could decide which scenery to display to the game player. 

Quake 3 Arena and Medal of Honour: Allied Assault ( which uses Q3A codebase) used BSP trees for storing the scenery.  Wherever the player was looking the tree would be traversed and only the polygons (triangles) that were viewable would be rendered by the graphics chip.  Try to think of the players view in a game was like a searchlight beam and whatever the light touches is rendered onto a persons computer screen and everything else is ignored- unseen and not rendered.

“I wonder if I could break the transactions up into a binary space partitioned tree ?”

For those interested, a wee bit of light reading is here: [Binary Space Partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning)

A binary space partitioned tree begins at one polygon and uses its surface as a plane to cut throughout the rest of the scene.

This kind of plane: [Geometry Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28geometry%29)

Each polygon the plane hits gets sliced in two.

Note: The ‘node’ word used below is used for talking about the nodes in a BSP tree - not nodes in a computer network.  Think of nodes as where an actual tree branch splits into two smaller branches.

All the polygons in front of the plane go into the left branch (node) and all the polygons behind the plane go into the right branch (node).

Traversing each branch (node) in turn, a polygon is chosen closest to the middle of the remaining branch (node) scenery and another plane slices the branch (node) in two.

The traversal continues until the entire scenery has been sliced up into left/ right (or up/ down) branches (nodes) and they all end up at the leaves (nodes) which store the actual polygon geometry.

If we use the messages (transactions) as the equivalent of the polygon geometry then we could have a bunch of messages (transactions) in the leaf nodes at the bottom of a tree-like structure inside a data chunk.

Instead of a group of triangle vertices ( polygon geometry ) there would be a single message (transaction).

But how to connect them all up ?

A BSP tree is linked up by having a parent node pointing to the two child nodes, but that’s in memory.

The BSP file that’s stored on a disc drive can be easily modified ( easy as in it’s possible instead of impossible ).

The messages (transactions) within a chunk cannot be allowed to be changed.

What if, instead of memory pointers or offsets pointing parents to children we use one of those crypto hashing functions ?

The bottom-most leaf nodes could use data specifically from their message (transaction) to generate a node hash, right ?

Parent Branch nodes could create a hash using the hashes of their two children hashes.

This would create a tree-like structure within a data chunk where the topmost parent hash could be included within the data chunks proof-of-work header.

This would allow all the messages (transactions) to be locked into a tree that doesn’t allow them to be modified because all parent node hashes would have to be recalculated and the trees root hash would be different from the original generated hash.

And that would mean that the entire proof-of-work hash value would be changed.

The same mechanism used to transfer the transaction data around the network would also be used to send the chunks of data.

If a network node received a changed dataChunk and compared it with one they already held then they’d notice the proof-of-work is different and would know someone was attempting to modify the data.

Bloody [redacted] ! I think this might actually work.

I email (2) to inform him that I was again making progress on the issue.

I explained the idea of having a simplified BSP tree to store the messages (transactions) into a dataChunk and have them all hashed together into a tree with the proof-of-work plus parent hash at the top.

He said, “If I change the transaction stuff to use this method I’m going to have to throw out half my white paper and a third of my code”.

“Well, “ I replied. “You can keep using your current transaction stuff if you want.  It can never work in a no-trust environment but if that makes you happy then stay with it.  For me - I’m going to take the red pill and continue down this path and see where it gets me.  I’m also working on solving the Byzantine Generals Dilemma.”

“Ok. ok”, he said. “I’ll go with what you’ve come up with.  But what are you stuffing about with the Byzantine problem ?  It’s an impossible crypto puzzle and has nothing to do with electronic cash.”

“It has everything to do with an actual working electronic cash system”, I  said.  “If it can be solved then we could use a peer-to-peer network for transferring all the data about the place !  Kinda like Napster.”

“Didn’t Napster get shut down because it used a central server ?”, (2) retorted.

“What’s another peer-to-peer network ? IRC ? Tor ?, BitTorrent ?”

“I think we can use IRC to hold the initial node addresses until such time the network is big enough for large permanent nodes to appear”, (2) suggested.

(2) asked, “What’s to stop nodes from sending different dataChunks to other nodes ?  If they’re just stacked on top of one-another then they can be swapped in and out at any time.  That’s why a third party server is needed for setting the official time on the network for the transactions.  Someone could create different transactions and change the time to whatever they want if they can use whatever time they choose.”

I said I’ll think on it some more.

**A Kronos Stamp Server**

If a third party cannot be used for a time stamp server then we’d have to reevaluate what is meant by time in a computer network.

What if how people think about time is actually wrong and everyone is assuming it to be something that it really isn’t ?

If you hold one fist in front of you to represent time - call it ‘now’ time.

[Now Time](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/now-fist.jpg)

If you hold another fist after the first fist you can call it ‘after now’ time.

[After Now Time](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/after-now-fist.jpg)

If you hold another fist before the first fist you can call it ‘before now’ time.

[Before Now Time](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/before-now-fist.jpg)

What we’re actually looking at is a chronological order stamp.  The actual time itself is pretty much irrelevant except for when comparing two things in their chronological order.

It should work whether the ‘now’ time is the time shown on your clock/watch right now, or on a date two hundred years from now, or 1253BC ( Tuesday ).

The before/ now/ after can be adjusted accordingly:

after ( Wednesday )

now ( 1253BC  Tuesday )

before ( Monday )

And if the time value used is the time shown on your clock, is it the same as the time value shown on your watch ?  On the microwave ?  DVD player ?  Computer ?  Phone ?
You may find that all the time pieces inside your own home vary by a few seconds or even a few minutes !

In an office almost every single person has a timepiece that has a different time to everyone else - even if it’s only different by a few milliseconds.

Does that mean as you walk from your kitchen ( showing 2:02pm on the wall ) into the lounge ( showing 2:01 on the DVD player ) that’s you’ve just entered a time portal and been magically transported back in time by a minute ?

Of course not.  They’re all equally valid time values that humans have made up to be roughly synchronised with one-another.

All that really matters is the range of valid time values used to indicate “This is Now”, “This is Next” or “This was Before”.

If the network nodes all agree on what range of time values should be valid to be “now” or “near now” then each node could use its own time value in any data messages (transactions or dataChunks) and no third party timestamp server would be required.

I email (2) and let him know the time-stamp server issue has been resolved by having the nodes use a Kronos-Stamp.

“What the [redacted] is a ‘Kronos-Stamp’ ? ”, (2) asked.

I give him the explanation I gave to you ( the Reader ) above.

“But what’s this ‘Kronos’ word mean ?”, (2) asked.

“It’s short for “Chronological Order.  It’s a Chronological Order Stamp.  We don’t need a Time-Stamp any more,” I replied.

“But what’s with the ‘K’ ?”

“To annoy all those folks who’d rather get furious about misspelt words than try and understand the concept that’s being explained. ”

“Well, the crypto community won’t like it spelt like that.  We’re going to have to call it a Time-Stamp server because that’s what they understand,” (2) said.

I said, “Time-Stamps are for systems using third party servers.  Chronological Order Stamps are for peer-to-peer networks.”

“Ok,” (2) said. “We can use this time thing for making sure the dataChunks are in a chronological order but what stops someone from just changing the time of their computer to be a little earlier than someone else and having their version of the data accepted by everyone else?”

I said I’ll think on it some more.

**A Chain of Data Chunks**

On another project I was rereading some information about rendering graphical data.

In 3D graphics triangles are used to create any object you see onscreen.

Example of Triangle types:

[Triangle Types](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/triangle-types.png)

Each numbered dot represents a vertex.

The data for the vertices are placed into arrays called buffers.

They’re just a long list of data points which are loaded onto a graphics card and told to be drawn.

[Triangle Strip](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/triangle-strip.png)

A triangle strip is a strip of triangles which share the data points from the previous triangle.

Each triangle in the strip is drawn alternating between clockwise/counter-clockwise (indicated by the red and green arrows)

The very first triangle must have all of its vertices added (all three vertices 1,2,3)

Every other triangle in the strip only has to add one more single vertex and reuse the previous two vertices.

The second triangle just adds the data for the vertex (4) and reuses vertices 2 and 3 that’s already embedded inside the strip.

This makes the strip incredibly compact in size for the data it’s meant to represent plus locks each triangle inside the strip and they cannot be accidentally used elsewhere.

If a triangle was wanted to be drawn in a different order then an entirely new triangle strip would have to be created.

A key side affect is that a triangle strip can be set to start drawing at any vertices (except vertices 2 and 3) and the entire strip from that data point onwards will be drawn.

I was staring at this for a long time thinking “This could be used for the electronic cash project somehow, but how exactly ?”

I kept going through the explanation for the triangle strip again and again trying to understand what I was seeing.

Then it dawned on me.

The triangles were the data in a triangle strip.

The chunks were the data in the electronic cash project.

If the triangles were actually the dataChunks then that means the vertices were the proof-of-work header, with the embedded root hash for the messages/ transactions.

The lines in the triangle strip represented the reuse of previous vertex data.

So that means I could reuse the proof-of-work hash from a previous dataChunk and embed that into the next proof-of-work as well !

And just like a triangle strip the dataChunks couldn’t be moved elsewhere unless all the surrounding proof-of-work hashes were redone again.

It reinforces the Kronos Stamp by embedding the previous proof-of-work hash into it so we know what came before now and what was next after previous.

If the entire network was using their cpu power to generate these proof-of-work hashes then a hostile actor would need half the processing power to get a fifty percent chance of generating the proof-of-work hash for a block and modifying the data.

However every second block on average would be generated by an opposing hostile actor and so whatever the fifty percent hostile actor was attempting to do wouldn’t last for very long.

[DataChunk Chain](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/datachunk-chain.png)

I needed to have some of the math for this looked at to see if I was on the right track.

I email (2) and let him know about this idea of hooking together the dataChunks like a chain so that they couldn’t be modified without redoing the proof-of-work hashing.

He liked the idea of a chain.

I said, “You see how all the appended dataChunk headers reuse the hash from the previous dataChunk header ?  Take a look at the very first dataChunk.”

“What’s so special about that” , (2) asks.

“Well,” I say. “The first dataChunk header hasn’t got any previous hashes it can use, so in the beginning it will have to use a made up ‘previous hash’ in its header.  In the beginning it has to use a manually create hash.  In the beginning… get it?”

“What ?”, (2) asks.

“The very first data chunk is the Genesis dataChunk.  In the beginning there is the Genesis dataChunk”, I reply.

He said he likes that idea very much as he’d just started being involved in a church in the past year or so.

I ask him to get the other cryptos he’s in contact with to play around with the numbers and see if this would work.

(2) asked, “Hang on. How would this solve the double-spending problem ?”

[Bitcoin Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5afqas/bitcoin_origins/)

The following are a few notes I've been making on the original development of the tech behind Bitcoin.

This is still in early draft form so expect the layout and flow to be cleaned up over time.

Also be aware that the initial release of the Bitcoin white paper and code was what we had cut down to from earlier ideas.

This means that some of the ideas below will not correspond to what would end up being made public.

As I'm paraphrasing dim memories some of the sections are out-of-order whereby some things occurred earlier rather than later.  As I recall more I'll be updating this story elsewhere for uploading when it appears more substantial.

As noted on the first post ( link supplied above ):

There is no verification of truth here.

There is absolutely no evidential proof that I had any part in the project.

Take this as just a fictional story if you wish.

*Six Months In A Leaky Boat*

continued ...

“You’re saying that we can use this proof-of-work thing to inject electronic cash into the network and have it tied to fiat currencies, but how would the network know what the local fiat currency is to figure out the correct fiat-currency-to-electronic-cash exchange rate ?”, (2) asked.

“Maybe we could have a server that keeps a record of what the various electricity companies charge and have the software get the values from there ?”, I suggested.  “Some of these new mobile phones, the smart phones, the cellular network phones in folks pockets, have GPS chips incorporated into them, right ?  And everyone has them or will be getting them as they become more popular.  This means everyone will have a device on them which will allow the software to include a GPS location so that the network knows which exchange rate to use for that particular minted cash.

“But how will the network know that the GPS coordinates haven’t been changed and set to another location ?”, (2) asked. “Wouldn’t that mean relying on a trusted third party again ?  I thought you said we have to get away from that ?  If we cannot trust a single computer for minting cash into the network then maybe we shouldn’t trust any at all ?”

“Uhh… dunno,” I replied. “I’ll get back to that later”, I said.

“Ok, ” (2) said.  “How are we going to have the transactions sent to other people on the network ?  All the other white papers are expecting people to connect directly to one of the trusted computers to purchase the electronic cash and to transfer it to someone else through them.  If we’re not going to use a trusted computer for this and will have the proof-of-work generate the cash, then how do people receive or pay the cash ?  Also: How would the network trust that the cash is valid if no computer is being used for time-stamping and validating the cash ?”

I told him I’d have to think about it.

Multiple ideas were given and discarded.  He consulted with (3) about every possible solution and every one was a failure.

They either resulted in having to rely on at least one server to hook everything together or would break if multiple transaction messages were sent at the same time to different computers.

After a week or so of this I’d finally burnt myself out and decided that it’s quite possible that everyone else was correct when they said that you couldn’t solve double-spending in a digital world without depending upon a trusted third party.

I stopped emailing (2) at that point, hoping it’d all go away.

After a week he emailed me asking if I’d come up with another solution for testing.

I told him that I don’t think there is a solution and maybe he should just use part of what he had in his original white paper and rely on a trusted third party like everyone else.

He said something along the lines of “Like [redacted] I will !  You’ve taken me down this path of not trusting a single computer and that’s what I want.  No-one's done that before and if we break it, it will probably change everything ! ”

I told him I’m taking a break from it all for a while.

Another week passes and he emails me again.

He said, “How are you feeling ?  Sorry to be so harsh on you but I really need this to work.  I’ll leave you be if that’s what you want.  Just let me know when you’re able to continue.”

Another week goes by and whenever I begin to think of the problem I just say to myself “To [redacted] with him and his electronic cash problem.”

For comfort I turn to perusing through some of my old Win32 Asm proggys (I called them “proggys” because I thought of them as small, incomplete computer programs - kind of like examples and tutorials).

I also begun reminiscing about the Amiga 500 days and the proggys I made back then (late 1980’s through to mid 1990’s).

Knowing that one of the most difficult issues with electronic cash revolved around the networking architecture and how data would be propagated by the networked computers I began going through some of the discussions I had back in 2005 and 2006 with someone who was attempting to make a tank game.

I explained to him the main difference between TCP and UDP ( [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) ).

If you need data packages to arrive in a particular order with confirmation that they’ve arrived then you’d use TCP.

If you need velocity of data packets you can throw all the protocol error checking out and use UDP.

That’s one of the reasons great online multi-player games uses UDP.  It reduces the latency with the data being transmitted around the network.

The main difficulty is in building the gaming system in such a way so that the data the servers and clients transmit and receive work when data packets never arrive.

TCP guarantees delivery if the network is functioning while with UDP you do not know if a particular packet ever arrived or if packets arrived in a different order to transmission due to separate packets traversing the internet via different pathways.

Many online games were usually built for single-player first and the multi-player code would be chucked into the codebase near the end of development.

This would mean that all of the game code objects and classes were made to use known values at any particular time and could not work in a UDP environment without re-architecting the entire code base from scratch.

You’d find many of the games that also included multi-player gameplay options ended up using TCP for the network communications and this made all of these games slow over the network with high latency and unplayable lag as the gameplay would be faster than the network data packets telling your computer where your opponents are located.

The various tanks games around 2005 were built as above.  I convinced this person to focus on the multi-player aspect of the game because he could always add in single-player later on.

Multiple players would have to drive and fire tanks around a field while being updated continuously about the complete state of the network.

This is usually accomplished by having a single server that receives all of the current data from all the player clients and dishes out the official game state back to all of those player clients so that everyone knows who went where, who fired at what and who has been hit.

However even with using UDP there is a bottleneck in the network with the server itself only being able to process a peak number of connections and data throughput every second.  It could only scale so high.

We had talked about different ways to improve this by possibly having relay servers on some of the players computers or having a more peer-to-peer like structure so that each player client only had to get the latest data from its nearest neighbours in the network and only transmit to their peers so that a fully server-less multi-player game could be created.

How the data could be moved about without someone creating a hack that could change the data packages in their favour couldn’t be figured out.

In the end he went with using a central server with both TCP and UDP depending upon what data packages were needed to be sent - general gameplay data (tank movements) via UDP and server state (for confirming who hit what) via TCP.

If a peer-to-peer network was to be used for electronic cash then to be scalable the data packages must be able to be transmitted with as high a velocity as possible. It must work with the majority of transmissions using UDP.

If two-way communication is required then a return ip/port can be included within a UDP data package or a TCP connection could be used.

I had also read and reread this thing that has been going around the crypto community for ages called the Byzantine Generals Dilemma (or worded in a similar way).

It’s supposed to be impossible to solve and at least a couple of well-known academics and crypto folks had “proven” it was impossible to solve only a few years previously.  They had pretty much staked their reputations on the fact that it was unsolvable.

I thought “Wouldn’t it be absolutely hilarious if the solution to this double-spending problem is also the solution to the impossible Byzantine Generals Dilemma and could be found using ideas from the Amiga days and 3D programming and uses multi-player gaming techniques ?  That would annoy the [redacted] out of the crypto community and take those elitists down a peg or two !”

(This is where you’d see the screen go all watery-wavy as the scene morphs to a time in the past when I was a moderator of the Win32 Asm community)

The assembly community and the crypto community share a lot in common.

They’re made up of some of the most brilliant folks in the computing industry where huge egos do battle against one-another.

You’d also find folks in one community existing within the other.

Both communities are made up of both light and dark actors.

The light actors are those who are very public.

They are academics, researchers, security professionals, and so on.

The dark actors are …  (and that’s all I’ll say about them).

Except to say that the light crypto actors are usually doing work to undo what the dark assembly actors are doing.

It’s one [redacted] of a game !

To have a message board that was able to accommodate all actors required a few tough rules and stiff execution of them if the forum was to continue to exist.

Many of the other assembly boards were being snuffed out by government actors forcing the hosting service to shut them down.

This was mainly due to the assembly forums insistence of allowing threads to exist which showed exactly how to break and crack various websites/ networks/ software/ etc.

Whenever one of these sites were shut down the members would disperse to the various remaining assembly boards.

So we received an influx of new members every few months whenever their previous venue went up in smoke.

However they never learned from the experience ( or, at least,  some of them never learned ) and they would continue to openly chat about dark subjects on *our* board, which put our board in danger as well.

The moderators had to be strong but fair against these new-comers, especially knowing that they (the moderators) could be actively attacked (digitally) at any time.

Occasionally one of these new members would decide to DDOS ( Distributed Denial Of Service ) us, however they apparently forgot what message board they were attempting to DDOS, and it always ended very badly for them.

We would also occasionally get someone with quite a bit of knowledge in various subjects - some of it very rare and hard-to-come-by.  It would be terrible if that member left and took their knowledge with them.

They would complain that there were too many noobs asking questions on the message board and it would be better if there was a higher level of knowledge and experience needed before the noobs could enter the message board or post a question.

Once I told one of these members, “Ok then.  Let’s say that thing you’ve been talking about for the past two weeks, and calling everyone else a noob for not understanding it, is the knowledge limit.  I know that you only first read about it two and a half weeks ago.  Let’s say I make that the limit and predate it three weeks ago and kick your butt out of this community ?""

“That’s not very fair”, he protested.

I told him, “None of us know where the next genius is coming from.  The main members of this community, the ones that input more than everyone else, have come from incredibly varied environments.  Some with only a few weeks knowledge are adding more to the community every week compared to members who have been with us for years.  One of the members you’ve dissed in the past couple of weeks could in turn create the next piece of software that all of us use.  We don’t know that.  What we need to do is have a community that is absolutely inclusive for every single person on the planet no matter where they’ve come from, what their wealth is, what their nation state does, and to keep our elitism in check.”

“Ok, fair enough, I’m sorry, please don’t kick me out.” was the usual result.

These were very intelligent folks, however they had to be reminded that we are a single species moving through time and space together as one.


(This is where you’d see the screen go all watery-wavy as the scene morphs back to me figuring out this double-spending problem)

As you may tell, I don’t tolerate elitist attitudes very well.

Which also helped when I turned towards the elitist attitudes I read in some of these academic papers and crypto white papers ( some of which were more like notes than white papers ) and messages on the crypto forums and mailing lists.

“ ‘*It’s impossible to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem*’ they say ? Let’s see about that !”

**Byzantine General’s Dilemma**

The problem is written a little bit differently depending upon where you read it.

An occasional academic may be more well-read than others and becomes the “official” wording used by many others.

I’ll paraphrase it a wee bit just so you get a general idea of the problem (pun intended).

We go back to the time of the city-states.

This is before the notion of sovereign states - there’s just a bunch of individual city-states that control the surrounding nearby country side.

Every so often a bunch of these city-states would get together and form something called an empire.

Alliances would change and friends would become enemies and enemies friends on a month-to-month and year-to-year basis.

To expand the empire the bunch of city-states would send armies controlled by generals to take over an adjacent city-state.

These city-states are huge (for their time) walled cities with armies in strong fortifications.

Let’s say there are six generals from six empire city-states that surround an adjacent city-state - all generals and their armies are equidistant from each other.

They cannot trust one another because at any moment one of them may become an enemy.  Or they could be an enemy pretending to be a friend.

Due to the defensive forces of the defending city-state, the six generals know that they could take the city if every one of them attacked at the same time from around the city.

But if only a few attacked and the others retreated then the attackers would be wiped out and the surviving city-states, with their generals and their armies intact,  would end up over-powering and enslaving their previous friendly city-states.

No-one could trust any other.

(This has massive parallels with modern day sovereign nations and their playing of the game with weapons, armies/air forces/navies, economics, currency, trade agreements, banks, education, health, wealth, and so on)

The generals have to send a message to the other generals telling them if they’re going to attack or retreat.

The problem is that a general could send a message to the general to his left saying that he’ll attack and send a second message to the general to his right that he will retreat.

Some possible solutions said that there should be two lieutenants to receive the message from the general and that they could check each others message to confirm that they are indeed identical before passing the messages onto the left and right messengers.

However the messengers in turn could change the message from “attack” to “retreat” or vice versa or not deliver the message at all.

Plus the generals, once a message has been sent out as “attack” could turn around and retreat, or vice versa.

I thought to myself, “I bet the folks who thought up this problem are feeling pretty damn smug about themselves.”

However I was a moderator of an assembly community.

I’d translated the DirectX8 C++ COM headers into their x86 assembly equivalent (using techniques built by others far more smarter than me, and with help for some files when DX8.1 was translated), built a PIC micro controller assembler in x86 assembly language, and many other things.

And because I've done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with creating a solution to the Byzantine Generals Dilemma !

Elitist ego ? What elitist ego ? They’re all amateurs !

Let us begin:

“Ok,” I thought to myself.  “let’s start at the beginning.  We need a network.  What does that look like ?”

The Generals are going to be represented as computers.  The servers in the network. The nodes.

The messages are going to be the data travelling between them.

Transactions will be used as the first example of data.

For those reading, hold your hands in front of you - touch the bottom of the palms together with the fingers far apart, thumbs touching each other, twist your elbow and wrists so that the fingers are pointing upwards - slightly curved.

[Fingers as Nodes](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/fingers-as-nodes.jpg)

These are the nodes in the network.

The node where the thumbs touch is your own node.

No node can trust each other.

For this network structure to work, it must work even with every single node actively hostile toward one another.

“Surely the network can trust my node. I’m good ! “, you may say to yourself.

But you would be wrong.

This network is not about you.  It must exist even when you don’t.

If there were a hundred nodes then it’d be ninety-nine to one against you.

As far as the network is concerned, there’s ninety-nine nodes that cannot trust you compared to your one.

So accepting that all nodes cannot trust one another, plus they are actively hostile toward one another, we can …

“But hang on ! ”, you say. “What do you mean ‘actively hostile’ ?  Surely they’re not all hostile ? ”

Even if most of the time nodes will play nice with one another, the rules of the game must be structured in such a way that they will work *even if all participants were actively hostile toward one another* .

Because if it still worked with everyone having a go at each other then you would’ve built something that could last for a very long time.

You could build something whereby sovereign nations could no-longer undermine other sovereign nations.

It would be the great equaliser that would allow stronger nations to stop screwing around with weaker nations.

It’s the ultimate golf handicapping system.  Everyone could play this game.

Kind of like my moderating style from the assembly days.

So we have these hostile nodes.

It has to be able to work with any type of message or data package.  Initially it will be built for electronic cash transactions.

I will type it as ""messages (transactions)"" below to indicate that the messages are the messages in the Byzantine Generals Dilemma and that the message could be any data whatsoever - ""transactions"" just being the first.  Plus in a roundabout way a message is also a transaction whereby a transaction doesn't have to be only for electronic cash - it's just an indication of what items are being transacted.

We want to send messages (transactions) between them and make sure everyone agrees that the messages (transactions) are correct.

That implies that every single node would have to store an exact copy of all the messages (transactions) and be able to read through them and confirm that they are valid.

And whenever a node receives a message (transaction) it would check it for validity and if it’s ok then that message (transaction) would be passed onto the adjacent nodes.

But how to stop a node changing the message (transaction) contents and sending different results to two adjacent nodes ?

How about taking the possibility of messages (transactions) being able to be changed out of the problem completely ?

We could using private/public keys to sign the messages (transactions) so that they couldn’t be changed.

The owner could sign a message (transaction) with the owners private key and everyone could check its validity with the owners public key, but not be able to change it.

Right.  The messaging ( transactions/ data/ etc ) part of the problem is partially solved.

Now how do I solve the generals problem so that they all play nicely with one another ?

If we can make sure all generals (nodes) can get the identical data and that they can all validate that the data is identical and unchanged then the Byzantine Generals Dilemma would be solved.

**Data Chunks**

It became apparent that every major node on a network would have to store an entire copy of all of the data so that they could verify that the data was correct and hadn’t been modified.

The data would probably end up looking like a list or stack, with each incoming valid message (transaction) placed on top of the previous messages (transactions).

What looks like a stack but hasn’t got the memory restrictions like a normal assembly stack ?

When I was reminiscing about the Amiga 500 days I recalled having to muck about with IFF.

That’s the [Interchange File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_File_Format).

The basics of it is like this:

In a plain text file there are chunks of data.

Each chunk of data begins with a chunk identifier - four characters that indicate to a program what type of data resides within that chunk (example “WAVE”, “FORM”, “NAME”).

An IFF file can have many data chunks of differing types.

The .AVI (audio/video), .ILBM (bitmap) and .WAV (audio wave) file formats are based upon the IFF.

I thought, “What if one of these data chunks was called ‘MSG ’, ‘DATA’ or ‘TSTN’ (TranSacTioN) ? ”

That might work.

Where would the proof-of-work thing come into play ?

Let’s say we replace the four-character-identifier with a header so that the proof-of-work can be done on it ? 

That means the header would now include an identifier for what type of data is included within the chunk, plus a value used to modify the difficulty for generating a hash (the number of zeros needed to prepend the generated hash), a random value which increments as hashes are attempted so that the header data is slightly different for each hash attempt, plus the data itself.

But once a correct hash is generated, that particular node would mint electronic cash to pay for the electricity used.

Remember: The electronic cash is supposed to cover the actual fiat currency costs involved in doing the proof-of-work computations.

As the owner of the node computer is paid by an employer in fiat currency and has paid personal tax on it, and they have used that fiat currency to pay their electricity provider (which in turn pays company, state and value-added or goods&amp;service taxes), then the electronic cash is equivalent to swapping your own money for a soft drink can from a vending machine.

Except, due to the media of this system, you’d be able to go to another vending machine and reenter your soft drink can for a refund in fiat currency again ( minus a restocking fee ) and the vending machine could be anywhere on the planet.

That means an extra message (transaction) would have to be included within the chunks data for the minted electronic cash.

If there must be at least two messages (transactions) within a data chunk - the actual message (transaction) plus the message (transaction) for the node that generates the hash - then maybe there could be more messages (transactions) stored in each data chunk ?
How would a bunch of messages (transactions) be stored inside a data chunk ?

I remembered learning about binary space partitioning around 2006.

BSP trees were used to store 3D graphic polygons that were able to be quickly traversed so that a game could decide which scenery to display to the game player. 

Quake 3 Arena and Medal of Honour: Allied Assault ( which uses Q3A codebase) used BSP trees for storing the scenery.  Wherever the player was looking the tree would be traversed and only the polygons (triangles) that were viewable would be rendered by the graphics chip.  Try to think of the players view in a game was like a searchlight beam and whatever the light touches is rendered onto a persons computer screen and everything else is ignored- unseen and not rendered.

“I wonder if I could break the transactions up into a binary space partitioned tree ?”

For those interested, a wee bit of light reading is here: [Binary Space Partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning)

A binary space partitioned tree begins at one polygon and uses its surface as a plane to cut throughout the rest of the scene.

This kind of plane: [Geometry Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28geometry%29)

Each polygon the plane hits gets sliced in two.

Note: The ‘node’ word used below is used for talking about the nodes in a BSP tree - not nodes in a computer network.  Think of nodes as where an actual tree branch splits into two smaller branches.

All the polygons in front of the plane go into the left branch (node) and all the polygons behind the plane go into the right branch (node).

Traversing each branch (node) in turn, a polygon is chosen closest to the middle of the remaining branch (node) scenery and another plane slices the branch (node) in two.

The traversal continues until the entire scenery has been sliced up into left/ right (or up/ down) branches (nodes) and they all end up at the leaves (nodes) which store the actual polygon geometry.

If we use the messages (transactions) as the equivalent of the polygon geometry then we could have a bunch of messages (transactions) in the leaf nodes at the bottom of a tree-like structure inside a data chunk.

Instead of a group of triangle vertices ( polygon geometry ) there would be a single message (transaction).

But how to connect them all up ?

A BSP tree is linked up by having a parent node pointing to the two child nodes, but that’s in memory.

The BSP file that’s stored on a disc drive can be easily modified ( easy as in it’s possible instead of impossible ).

The messages (transactions) within a chunk cannot be allowed to be changed.

What if, instead of memory pointers or offsets pointing parents to children we use one of those crypto hashing functions ?

The bottom-most leaf nodes could use data specifically from their message (transaction) to generate a node hash, right ?

Parent Branch nodes could create a hash using the hashes of their two children hashes.

This would create a tree-like structure within a data chunk where the topmost parent hash could be included within the data chunks proof-of-work header.

This would allow all the messages (transactions) to be locked into a tree that doesn’t allow them to be modified because all parent node hashes would have to be recalculated and the trees root hash would be different from the original generated hash.

And that would mean that the entire proof-of-work hash value would be changed.

The same mechanism used to transfer the transaction data around the network would also be used to send the chunks of data.

If a network node received a changed dataChunk and compared it with one they already held then they’d notice the proof-of-work is different and would know someone was attempting to modify the data.

Bloody [redacted] ! I think this might actually work.

I email (2) to inform him that I was again making progress on the issue.

I explained the idea of having a simplified BSP tree to store the messages (transactions) into a dataChunk and have them all hashed together into a tree with the proof-of-work plus parent hash at the top.

He said, “If I change the transaction stuff to use this method I’m going to have to throw out half my white paper and a third of my code”.

“Well, “ I replied. “You can keep using your current transaction stuff if you want.  It can never work in a no-trust environment but if that makes you happy then stay with it.  For me - I’m going to take the red pill and continue down this path and see where it gets me.  I’m also working on solving the Byzantine Generals Dilemma.”

“Ok. ok”, he said. “I’ll go with what you’ve come up with.  But what are you stuffing about with the Byzantine problem ?  It’s an impossible crypto puzzle and has nothing to do with electronic cash.”

“It has everything to do with an actual working electronic cash system”, I  said.  “If it can be solved then we could use a peer-to-peer network for transferring all the data about the place !  Kinda like Napster.”

“Didn’t Napster get shut down because it used a central server ?”, (2) retorted.

“What’s another peer-to-peer network ? IRC ? Tor ?, BitTorrent ?”

“I think we can use IRC to hold the initial node addresses until such time the network is big enough for large permanent nodes to appear”, (2) suggested.

(2) asked, “What’s to stop nodes from sending different dataChunks to other nodes ?  If they’re just stacked on top of one-another then they can be swapped in and out at any time.  That’s why a third party server is needed for setting the official time on the network for the transactions.  Someone could create different transactions and change the time to whatever they want if they can use whatever time they choose.”

I said I’ll think on it some more.

**A Kronos Stamp Server**

If a third party cannot be used for a time stamp server then we’d have to reevaluate what is meant by time in a computer network.

What if how people think about time is actually wrong and everyone is assuming it to be something that it really isn’t ?

If you hold one fist in front of you to represent time - call it ‘now’ time.

[Now Time](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/now-fist.jpg)

If you hold another fist after the first fist you can call it ‘after now’ time.

[After Now Time](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/after-now-fist.jpg)

If you hold another fist before the first fist you can call it ‘before now’ time.

[Before Now Time](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/before-now-fist.jpg)

What we’re actually looking at is a chronological order stamp.  The actual time itself is pretty much irrelevant except for when comparing two things in their chronological order.

It should work whether the ‘now’ time is the time shown on your clock/watch right now, or on a date two hundred years from now, or 1253BC ( Tuesday ).

The before/ now/ after can be adjusted accordingly:

after ( Wednesday )

now ( 1253BC  Tuesday )

before ( Monday )

And if the time value used is the time shown on your clock, is it the same as the time value shown on your watch ?  On the microwave ?  DVD player ?  Computer ?  Phone ?
You may find that all the time pieces inside your own home vary by a few seconds or even a few minutes !

In an office almost every single person has a timepiece that has a different time to everyone else - even if it’s only different by a few milliseconds.

Does that mean as you walk from your kitchen ( showing 2:02pm on the wall ) into the lounge ( showing 2:01 on the DVD player ) that’s you’ve just entered a time portal and been magically transported back in time by a minute ?

Of course not.  They’re all equally valid time values that humans have made up to be roughly synchronised with one-another.

All that really matters is the range of valid time values used to indicate “This is Now”, “This is Next” or “This was Before”.

If the network nodes all agree on what range of time values should be valid to be “now” or “near now” then each node could use its own time value in any data messages (transactions or dataChunks) and no third party timestamp server would be required.

I email (2) and let him know the time-stamp server issue has been resolved by having the nodes use a Kronos-Stamp.

“What the [redacted] is a ‘Kronos-Stamp’ ? ”, (2) asked.

I give him the explanation I gave to you ( the Reader ) above.

“But what’s this ‘Kronos’ word mean ?”, (2) asked.

“It’s short for “Chronological Order.  It’s a Chronological Order Stamp.  We don’t need a Time-Stamp any more,” I replied.

“But what’s with the ‘K’ ?”

“To annoy all those folks who’d rather get furious about misspelt words than try and understand the concept that’s being explained. ”

“Well, the crypto community won’t like it spelt like that.  We’re going to have to call it a Time-Stamp server because that’s what they understand,” (2) said.

I said, “Time-Stamps are for systems using third party servers.  Chronological Order Stamps are for peer-to-peer networks.”

“Ok,” (2) said. “We can use this time thing for making sure the dataChunks are in a chronological order but what stops someone from just changing the time of their computer to be a little earlier than someone else and having their version of the data accepted by everyone else?”

I said I’ll think on it some more.

**A Chain of Data Chunks**

On another project I was rereading some information about rendering graphical data.

In 3D graphics triangles are used to create any object you see onscreen.

Example of Triangle types:

[Triangle Types](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/triangle-types.png)

Each numbered dot represents a vertex.

The data for the vertices are placed into arrays called buffers.

They’re just a long list of data points which are loaded onto a graphics card and told to be drawn.

[Triangle Strip](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/triangle-strip.png)

A triangle strip is a strip of triangles which share the data points from the previous triangle.

Each triangle in the strip is drawn alternating between clockwise/counter-clockwise (indicated by the red and green arrows)

The very first triangle must have all of its vertices added (all three vertices 1,2,3)

Every other triangle in the strip only has to add one more single vertex and reuse the previous two vertices.

The second triangle just adds the data for the vertex (4) and reuses vertices 2 and 3 that’s already embedded inside the strip.

This makes the strip incredibly compact in size for the data it’s meant to represent plus locks each triangle inside the strip and they cannot be accidentally used elsewhere.

If a triangle was wanted to be drawn in a different order then an entirely new triangle strip would have to be created.

A key side affect is that a triangle strip can be set to start drawing at any vertices (except vertices 2 and 3) and the entire strip from that data point onwards will be drawn.

I was staring at this for a long time thinking “This could be used for the electronic cash project somehow, but how exactly ?”

I kept going through the explanation for the triangle strip again and again trying to understand what I was seeing.

Then it dawned on me.

The triangles were the data in a triangle strip.

The chunks were the data in the electronic cash project.

If the triangles were actually the dataChunks then that means the vertices were the proof-of-work header, with the embedded root hash for the messages/ transactions.

The lines in the triangle strip represented the reuse of previous vertex data.

So that means I could reuse the proof-of-work hash from a previous dataChunk and embed that into the next proof-of-work as well !

And just like a triangle strip the dataChunks couldn’t be moved elsewhere unless all the surrounding proof-of-work hashes were redone again.

It reinforces the Kronos Stamp by embedding the previous proof-of-work hash into it so we know what came before now and what was next after previous.

If the entire network was using their cpu power to generate these proof-of-work hashes then a hostile actor would need half the processing power to get a fifty percent chance of generating the proof-of-work hash for a block and modifying the data.

However every second block on average would be generated by an opposing hostile actor and so whatever the fifty percent hostile actor was attempting to do wouldn’t last for very long.

[DataChunk Chain](http://www.scrontsoft.com/bitcoinoriginsbook/datachunk-chain.png)

I needed to have some of the math for this looked at to see if I was on the right track.

I email (2) and let him know about this idea of hooking together the dataChunks like a chain so that they couldn’t be modified without redoing the proof-of-work hashing.

He liked the idea of a chain.

I said, “You see how all the appended dataChunk headers reuse the hash from the previous dataChunk header ?  Take a look at the very first dataChunk.”

“What’s so special about that” , (2) asks.

“Well,” I say. “The first dataChunk header hasn’t got any previous hashes it can use, so in the beginning it will have to use a made up ‘previous hash’ in its header.  In the beginning it has to use a manually create hash.  In the beginning… get it?”

“What ?”, (2) asks.

“The very first data chunk is the Genesis dataChunk.  In the beginning there is the Genesis dataChunk”, I reply.

He said he likes that idea very much as he’d just started being involved in a church in the past year or so.

I ask him to get the other cryptos he’s in contact with to play around with the numbers and see if this would work.

(2) asked, “Hang on. How would this solve the double-spending problem ?”

I have a five year old parent-linked Amex that has been minimally used and $3,000 in savings. I have $26,000 low-interest federal student loans that I have started paying, though I don't actually owe payments until February.  I am currently living on my parent's couch in order to get a head start on loan payments before going abroad with the Peace Corps for two years. I am temporarily working as a waitress, earning about $2,000 a month, pre-taxes. I spend very minimally and have historically been extremely financially responsible. My credit score is somewhere around 704-718 (Credit Karma). 

I am hoping to find a credit card with no foreign transaction fees and no annual fee that will accept me despite my youth/relative lack of credit. I'm not looking for huge rewards or anything, because I currently spend on food, bus passes, students loans, and not much else. Any recommendations for cards? 

I already tried to do some research and applied for the BankAmericard Travel card, which rejected my application. I'm assuming that my credit history was too short, so now I'm looking for some external help :)",finance,1478584184

personalfinance,"Bought new car, dealership changed our finance company...","About two weeks ago my husband and I purchased a heavily discounted new car since his car was on it's way downhill, had been for a while, and was going to cost more in repairs than what it was worth (even if he did the work himself). We got a great deal and once we purchased the new vehicle, sold his vehicle and wanted to put that full amount down on the new loan.

We went in with our own financing through Capital One; the way CapOne works is you run your credit at the dealership through CapOne in order to get the final terms of the auto loan, which was fine by us as it was stated in the pre-approval. Because we originally didn't put any money down we got around 5% interest through Capital One.

We asked if they ran our credit through any other lenders and they said no, they'd only run it through CapOne and that was fine with us since we intend to have the vehicle paid off by August 2017 (or sooner).

Fast forward to last Friday (a week after buying the new car), I head into the dealership to figure out who to contact to put the money from husband's car sale toward the new auto loan.  I'd looked around but was unable to figure out where to send it, found three different addresses for CapOne auto finance, etc., and thought it better to go to the dealership.  I'm glad I went in, because when I got there, the finance person informed me that our auto loan was through Chase, NOT CapOne, and never had been through CapOne. We signed all the paperwork under the impression that our credit had only been run through CapOne and no others, and that that's who our loan was through with the loan terms we'd recieved. 

Our new APR with Chase is a little over 1% lower, but is that normal- for a dealership to do that and not inform you?  I looked later and found they'd run our credit through CapOne, Chase, and two or three other banks when they said they only ran it through CapOne.  Is that even legal?  

I'm not displeased about the new interest rate but I am really really put off by the fact that our loan is through an entirely different lender than we thought and were told, and that nobody informed us.",finance,1478587968

personalfinance,Career change advise (old vs new),"Semi complicated situation here, but looking for some advise to make sure I'm making the correct financial moves. Both options have me moving back to the US in March '17, and have identical 401K/health options. 

Current:

65k base
13k COL adjustment (assignment in Asia)
26k housing allowance
12k utilities/transit reimbursement 

Offer:

87k base
8.7k annual bonus
5k signing bonus
5k relocation (not sure if this is reimbursed, but it will be substantially less to move back)
15k stock (vested over 3 years)
Housing in Asia paid until lease is up

Since I am living abroad, I qualify for a tax credit in the US, so I am exempt from federal taxes while I am in Asia, and I will continue this until I officially return to the US regardless of which option I choose. 

I will be returning back to the states on March '17, and when I do, at my current position, I will drop back down to the 65k base with the potential of a 20-30% pay increase for a proportion after Q1 '17. 

I like my current job enough, but unless my math is completely off, it would be extremely foolish to not take the new offer. 

The way I am seeing it now is as follows when I return:

Current - 65k with possibility of 20-30% raise in 2017
New- 106k with both bonuses, relo and stock in 2017

Am I missing anything huge here? Need to make the decision by Friday.

personalfinance,Looking for a good bank to open a long-term savings account with,"Hi all,

I'm trying to establish an emergency fund and have decided that my best bet is to just open an account at a separate bank than where my current checking/savings account is (Wells Fargo).

investing,Easy way to Hedge Against possible downturn (x-pos r\StockMarket),"With so many events causing uncertainty and potentially reversing the market direction (new president, arguably overvalued market, fed interest rate hike, etc) as a non-active trader I have been thinking about ways to hedge or potentially profit from a potential market downturn.
For background I’ve been buying (and occasionally selling) stocks for a long time (10+years), I watch the markets fairly closely and follow the news for the stocks I own but I don't really have the time or confidence to trade in and out of my positions all the time or get involved in options trading but I want to attempt to at least position myself so I’m not always 100% betting on the market going up all the time.
I was thinking about buying a short S&amp;P 500 ETF such as SH with the idea being I could sell if the market drops significantly at some point to either lock in cash gains or perhaps use the proceeds to buy more shares in my long term positions at what would likely be historically lower prices\valuations. My theory is while my long term positions may lose value on paper due (something I can live with as I’ve already been through a major downturn) but they will eventually return to previous levels over the long term and I will have taken advantage of the market reversal to some extent without doing anything too risky. On the flip side if the market just keeps marching up or even shoots up drastically if Hillary wins I would have a paper loss in the short term on the short ETF but it seems like with enough time there will eventually be a correction or downturn and this position could then be sold at a profit. Does this sound like a reasonably sound idea or is there something I’m missing?",finance,1478616631
personalfinance,Student Loan refinancing,"I'm in my late 20s and I have two sets of loans:  
1) One in my name, the (former) student, comes out to ~$220/mo  
2) Parent PLUS, under my parent's name, obviously, comes out to ~$525/mo.  
  
I have a great relationship with my parents and the idea has always been that these are my loans for me to repay, so right off the bat let me say this: no longer paying my parent's loan and leaving them with it is NOT AN OPTION.  
  
That said, between the two loans I'm paying ~$750/mo and it's starting to really weigh on me. The feds won't let us transfer both loans under my name so I could apply for income-based repayment. Is it a good idea to privately refinance and consolidate, and would my monthly payment even go down (am I correct in assuming that a private lender won't go for income-based repayment?)? What are my other options, if any, other than finding a higher-paying job (I'm looking)?",finance,1478618910
personalfinance,Small business year end profit allocations,"Hi all, so I come today for advice about my families' small business. This year we netted 80k and need to make disbursements, and we are at a loss for how to best to allocate the money.  I don't know if this is the right sub, or if this qualifies as ""tax evasion"" per the rules, I don't think it does.

 So, a little background. The business is a family-run C-Corp(working on transitioning to an S-corp); my family meaning me, my younger brother, and my parents (59 father &amp; 65 mother). Previously it was of little importance because we were operating as a family unit, but I've finally aged out of that program (about to turn 25). Anyway, so far this year we've paid out around 10k to my brother, 17k to me, and 65k to my father. My mom isn't on payroll.  We have a huge amount of carry over losses from previous years, and our savings account got drained after a series of equipment failures in 2015. So it would be good to put some money back there. 
So I guess my questions are; 

What is the smartest way to split up the money? since it's going into the family general fund regardless we can allocate it out however, and note that we live in California. Also of note is that my father has significant health problems and my mother hasn't taken SS. 

Is there a ""smart"" amount to put into savings based on our carry-over losses? 

The business could really use a pickup truck, is there any reason to buy cash, or should we buy on time at a low interest rate?

Thanks!",finance,1478618917

personalfinance,I don't trust myself with CCs but my wife insists on having one. What's the best CC for our situation?,"Hey r/personalfinance - 

Background info on current financial situation: my wife and I are currently battling credit card debt and student debt. Our total CC debt after getting married this past summer was ~$26k. There was also a TJ Maxx CC she didn't tell me about until after we got married that had a 29% interest rate that she had been carrying ~$2800 balance for several years because ""they sent her $10 off coupons occasionally"" lol.

She just started working last year and brings in about $85k / year. I'm currently in medical school with tuition covered by scholarship and we're able to live off her income completely so I've been using my living expenses loans to pay off high interest debt. So far I've been able to pay off about $6k in debt on high interest CCs and I've moved ~$9k onto two CCs with 18month 0% interest to give us some time to pay them off. We currently have about $14k on two other high interest CCs (22.99% for each). I just got a BestEgg loan for 11% that I'm using to pay of those cards and then I'll pay off that loan in January with my next loan disbursement (~5% interest). At this rate I should be able to get us out of ALL CC debt by next summer or fall. 

We have around a 3 month emergency fund, our mortgage plus utilities comes out to around $2k/month and we're able to cover most of our expenses with one of her biweekly paychecks for the month. We're also going to begin contributing to her 401k in January which matches. She has significant student loans (~120k) but her work makes payments for her and we should be on track to pay that off in about 10 years. I have some student debt as well but we have some time before we need to start making payments on it. 

My question is my wife still wants to carry a CC and have one for online purchases. I'm worried about us getting into another situation where we end up with high CC balances again. To be fair, a lot of the debt was racked up as she was finishing law school/studying for the bar and mine while I was transitioning out of work and into school so I don't see us running up debt like that again given our current spending patterns. Currently all our CCs but one are sitting in our safe. I don't do well with CCs so I've just decided that it's better for me not to have one or at least not carry one. She wants to keep one for online purchases and in case of emergencies. What would be a good card that we could keep ourselves out of trouble with? Is this the type of situation where a charge card would be better? 

I've been reading the FAQs/Wiki but wasn't sure what would be good for our situation, so just thought I'd ask. I appreciate any advice on good CC for our situation, Thanks! 

Edit for clarification: The debt is from us combined. Most of it is from living expenses to help us cover the transition we had last year where neither was working and during school (moving costs, utilities, food, etc, living expenses before the bar and before she got a job, etc.) a bit was for the wedding. We also had a pipe burst shortly after we bought our house that cost several grand, and we just got walloped by Hurricane Matthew and took a hit on a couple grand there too. My wife didn't go crazy and spend 20k online buying clothes.

I'm just trying to figure out what would be a good card to have in general for what little spending we want to do online, etc.",finance,1478626353

I am approved for a 75k HELOC for my house that is worth 450000 (insurance 1000/year taxes 5000/year). I have a roommate that pays 500/month to help with the taxes and insurance.

As the title states, I am about $100K in student loan debt and am looking to refinance as to get a lower interest rate.

I have been approved for the total amount between all of my loans, but one of my loans is no interest, and I see no point in paying this off with consolidation money.

NB: **Bold annotations are mine**.

***

## What happened?

Republican Donald Trump appears to have scored an upset victory in the race for the White House, upending the political establishment. The businessman had trailed in the polls throughout the campaign but began to close the gap just prior to the election. Undecided voters broke for Trump as he reiterated his criticism of Hillary Clinton and promised to strengthen border controls. Trump overcame Clinton's strength among Latinos with a surge in votes from rural and suburban America. The betting markets gave him just a 25% chance of occupying the White House, suggesting that recent polls once again failed to gauge the depth of opposition to mainstream politics, and dissatisfaction with elements of globalization.

The Republican Party won highly contested Senate seats in Indiana, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, while retaining Senate seats in Florida and Ohio. The party has retained control not only of the upper chamber, but also the House of Representatives, losing fewer seats than expected. It now appears we have a Republican sweep.

While historically a Republican sweep has been one of the most favorable scenarios for US equity markets (with a median annual total return of 15% for the S&amp;P 500 Index, between 1928 and 2014), Trump's win heralds a period of greater uncertainty in US policy. His lack of governing experience, potential difficulties building relationships with congressional leaders, and inconsistent policy pronouncements during the race make it hard to predict his policy initiatives or his effectiveness in driving them through Congress. Some investors have raised concerns that his election would mark a deterioration in global trade relations. During the campaign Trump pledged a tougher stance in trade talks with key trading partners such as Mexico and China as well as a review of US commitments to global security institutions. Trump also promised a clampdown on illegal immigrants, and his policies, if implemented, could cause the US labor force to contract.

## How did markets react?

The **market reaction to the outcome, in our view, will come in two stages**. A reflexive **flight to safety** has already occurred, with Treasury bond prices rising. The US dollar has declined around 1% on a trade-weighted basis, while safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen (+2.9%) rallied against USD. And gold also climbed 3.6%. Risk-sensitive assets lost ground – S&amp;P 500 futures fell 4.2%, and the Mexican peso shed 9% against the dollar.

While these first-round effects are certainly disconcerting, we expect the US equity market to recover over the medium term. CIO believes **fundamentals will outweigh political uncertainty** and US stocks can rebound on the back of accelerating earnings per share (EPS) growth. We forecast EPS to rise from 1% this year to 8% next. **Selected industries could benefit** from the possibility of more lenient regulation – particularly the **financial services and energy** sectors. Others businesses, especially those focused on national **defense** infrastructure, could enjoy advantages from more expansionary fiscal policy. Still, policy uncertainty may raise overall equity-market volatility, and lead to market dislocations that short-term investors might look to exploit.


For fixed income markets, we believe **the initial rally in Treasuries will be relatively short lived**. The market-implied probability of a December rate hike by the Federal Reserve fell below 50%, from around 82% on the eve of the vote. But longer term, Trump has promised tax cuts without offsetting expenditure reductions. A deteriorating fiscal outlook could push government borrowing costs higher. Markets are already shifting their central bank policy expectations to account for higher US policy uncertainty, and elevated market turbulence.

## What are we watching?

The implications of this surprise electoral outcome will take time to unfold. Given Trump's limited background in politics, markets will look toward his appointments for top administrative posts for clues about his policy agenda. The result underlines again the importance of investment diversification, both in terms of regions and asset classes.

While there have been some initial signs of stress in global equity markets, we note that Asian markets outside of Japan have been relatively robust, helped by the weakness of the US dollar and comparative stability of the USDCNY exchange rate. We will watch to see whether a weaker USD and lower US Treasury yields help ease financial conditions in global markets, and offset some of the initial asset price volatility.

In our latest Global Risk Radar report (31 October) we outlined a number of global investment ideas in the event of a Trump victory. When markets open in Europe, we will be looking for:

* Eurozone consumer discretionary stocks to underperform the broader market (MSCI EMU), on fears that increased protectionism and a weaker USD will damage the sector's earnings prospects.

**When trading begins** in the Americas, we expect to see:

* US defense companies outperforming the wider US stock market, as we believe a Trump presidency will boost US military spending.
* US managed care providers in the healthcare sector, by contrast, suffering, as Trump has promised to work on repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as ""Obamacare"").
* Mexican assets remain under pressure. We expect the Mexican peso to stay weak against the USD, and Mexican equities to underperform emerging market equities overall (MSCI Emerging Markets). A full 80% of Mexican exports are US bound, and 98% of remittances come from Mexican workers in the US. Trump's proposed curbs on immigration and trade may weaken these important economic ties.


We will give a fuller update in another CIO Note later today. This will touch on the day’s market developments worldwide, and examine the potential medium-term economic and investment consequences of a Trump administration.

personalfinance,Should i cash out my life insurance policy?,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

&amp;nbsp;

22 year old Canadian just starting my career, making just under $40k yr. When i was a born, my parents bought a whole life insurance policy for me which they paid monthly on until i was 18. I think they paid approximately $18 /month on the policy. It has a guarantee of $25,000 if something were to happen to me and has a cash out value of $5000. I am considering cashing out to clear off some of my student loan debt. My debts are as follows.

&amp;nbsp;

Federal Student Loan @5.7%: $18,500

Student Line of Credit @5.00%: $5,000

Provincial Student Loan @0.0%: $850

personalfinance,Grandfather wants to gift me money,"Hi PF, using a throwaway because I don't want others knowing about a potential windfall.

Situation:  My grandfather is getting up there in age (turning 91 in January) and has begun thinking about what he wants to happen with his money after he is gone.  He has very generously reached out to myself and my siblings, asking if he could help with some college debt.  Upon looking into it, it appears we could each receive  $14k from him each year without having to file with the IRS or claim against his lifetime exemptions.  No issues here.  The problem we have is that he has a pretty sizable estate which is over the limit for the state estate tax in MA (let's call it roughly $2 million right now).  Would him gifting us this money have any other tax implications to the state, or cause issues with his estate when he passes?  Would it make a difference if he used some of his federally lifetime exemption to gift more than $14k? 

Other potentially useful info:  He has already used ~$500k of his lifetime exemption to gift a vacation home to my parents, and ~$100k in assets to other family members.

He is also getting more protective of his money as he gets older.  He believes everyone is out to steal his money and won't talk to a financial planner about this.  That makes it hard because we have to do it, and then bring the info (and proof that it's correct) to him.  His main objective is getting whatever is left in his estate transferred to the family without ""the government"" taking a cut.

personalfinance,Just got my first job out of college. Have some questions about making a new budget.,"(throwaway account for privacy)

I'm graduating in December and I just accepted a job offer for a position near Denver that pays $49,000 a year.  As soon as I get the formal offer letter I want to start looking for a place to live.  However, this will be my first full-time salaried job without income from my parents so I want to clarify exactly how much I can afford on housing.  I've read some threads on this sub and elsewhere but my financial situation is a bit unique so I still want some input.

Also, since housing prices are increasing rapidly in the Denver area I want to buy a townhome or a condo as soon as I can.  As far as I can tell, I can buy a decent 2-bedroom place for what it costs to rent a shitty 2-bedroom apartment, and I'm concerned that what I can afford now will be out of my budget in a few years since prices are rising so quickly.  It's also difficult for me to rent since my dog is a mix of breeds frequently banned by landlords or their insurance companies.  

In addition to my income, I have enough to pay off my student loans, put $40-45,000 into a down payment and closing costs, use $10k on furniture and painting etc., and keep a year's worth of income for savings/investments (don't ask how I got this money, let's just say that it was NOT fun for me).  My credit score hovers in the mid 700s.  I can't pay off my student loans until I buy a home because my credit score will take a big hit without them, so I'll just pay double on the payments for the immediate future.  I spend just over $400 a month on food plus $2-300-ish on my cat and dog.  I'll have insurance through my work but no 401k so I'll want to get an IRA at some point.  My car isn't quite paid off but I'm negotiating with my parents since we paid off my dad's car instead of mine (his interest rate was higher but they pretty much used my money).  They might pay for the car if I let my sister rent from me for cheap when I buy a place.

So, assuming this financial situation, how much can I afford to spend on rent each month?  I want to get a 2 bedroom that I can afford by myself at first and then my sister will move in with me when her lease is up in May.  And how long of a lease should I get?  Six months?  A year?  Two years?  I'd like to settle down sooner than later and I HATE moving.  Will I need two years of salary history or will my good credit and savings be good enough if I have a letter from my employer once I pass the three-month probation period?  My new job pays considerably more than I could have hoped for and it's at a great organization so I can easily see myself staying put for ten or more years.  When I do get to the point where I can buy a place, how much home can I afford (in terms of listing price as well as monthly costs that include upkeep, utilities etc) with a relatively conservative budget?

I couldn't find my specific scenario online anywhere, and I don't see what I'm looking for on the tax.ohio.gov website if its out there.

A little further explanation of my situation: I lived in WI up until August of 2014. At that time, due to various personal reasons, I moved to Ohio. It wasn't until nearly a year later, in August of 2015 that I actually was employed again and made any money at all in Ohio. In the state of WI I made $49,000 between January and May of 2014. In early 2015, I filed my federal and WI state taxes, which were both accepted with no issues. I used TurboTax. I just now pulled up the TurboTax 1040 Return form  from 2014 to double check what was entered. I filled out the **Nonresident &amp; part-year resident Wisconsin income tax** form, listing my current OH address, and the August 2014 date that I moved between states. It also shows I reported my Adjusted Gross Income for WI as $49,000.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to also mention that during Tax season this year, when filling out my 2015 return, I received a notice from the state of Ohio stating I never filed my 2014 taxes. As I did not make any money in Ohio, during the 2015 filing I also then I reported that my 2014 Adjusted Gross Income for Ohio was $0.00. (Maybe this is where I screwed up?) Well, they accepted my 0 dollar return. Until today.

&amp;nbsp;

The letter I received today is dated October 13th, and postmarked November 7th. It says I was supposed to respond as of November 2nd or a assessment(legal bill) will be issued. So It sounds like I'm also being penalized for receiving their letter late, a late filing penalty, and interest charges on the State return I never paid?

&amp;nbsp;



&amp;nbsp;

The letter also says that my Ohio adjusted gross income for 2014 is $49000. Again, all that money was paid by my previous WI employer for the work I completed in WI. So should I have not filed for Wisconsin for 2014?  Should I have filed in Ohio and not WI for 2014? Or should I have split the money between the states, even though it was all earned in the state of Wisconsin?

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/5c0cvz/ubs_cio_on_trump_and_the_markets/

Emphasis is his.

***


**Dear reader,**

This year's US election campaign was one of superlatives. Two of the most unpopular candidates competed in one of the most divisive contests ever. Record numbers of key demographic groups turned up to vote. And we have perhaps the most unorthodox winner of a US presidential race in history.

Volatile trading today has yet again demonstrated the importance of a long-term focus for investors. Trading equities at the wrong time today could have permanently impaired wealth. In our tactical asset allocation, we continue to believe that fundamentals should outweigh political risk. We remain overweight US equities and emerging market (EM) equities, against underweights positions in high grade bonds and Swiss equities. And we stay overweight on an EM currency basket against a selection of developed market (DM) currencies.

We also add a new tactical position, an overweight in the euro relative to the US dollar. Signs that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may be falling behind the curve on inflation could mount if general prices rise under Mr. Trump's presidency. Meanwhile, we continue to expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to taper quantitative easing in 2017, favoring a stronger single currency.

For investors seeking additional opportunities, we also highlight a series of potential winners and losers from this election result. US financial services and health care equities, cyber security stocks, US senior loans, and infrastructure-linked investments are all potential beneficiaries.

Volatility is likely to remain relatively high as the market adjusts to a new equilibrium. Investors should therefore keep a long-term focus, but also remain alert to opportunities.

## Three things that caught my eye today:

* **The about turn in markets.** Although equities opened sharply lower in Asia and safe-haven investments rallied, the initial flight to quality moderated after Mr. Trump delivered his victory speech. The President-elect’s more conciliatory tone and pledge to work together with his opponents came as a positive surprise to market participants, many of whom had expected more of the aggressive rhetoric that marked his campaign. Some of the rebound for risk assets could be attributed to markets having 'learned their lesson' from the Brexit fall-out (in which risk assets first fell, then regained their poise). But we believe that positive fundamentals will ultimately prevail. We remain overweight US stocks in global tactical asset allocations.
* **The run up in 10-year yields.** The rise in US Treasury bond yields is one of the more significant moves in response to the election. It is important to note that this doesn't reflect a change in expectations around Fed policy – real rates are close to unchanged, and market pricing for a December rate hike has rebounded to about 80% (close to the pre-election probability). Instead the sell-off in bonds looks to be driven by higher inflation expectations, presumably in anticipation of looser US fiscal policy from a Trump administration. We continue to like US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).
* **The decline in Mexican asset prices.** Given that 80% of Mexican exports are US bound, and 98% of remittances come from Mexican workers in the US, the nation’s assets were among the few that failed to retrace their steps meaningfully through the day. Given Trump's proposed curbs on immigration and trade, we think these declines are justified, and we do not see any immediate opportunities in Mexican assets at present.

## What to watch in the months ahead

While Trump's speech has calmed some investors’ nerves, the coming 120 days should be more revealing. We expect the President-elect to give us an insight into how he plans to govern, and whether campaign rhetoric will (or won’t) translate into policy.

In the months ahead investors will need to pay attention to:

* **The President-elect’s nominees.** Trump's campaign was orchestrated by a close circle of advisors, and there is a risk that the presidential victory could reinforce his convictions in a 'closed' leadership style. This strategy would likely produce greater uncertainty for markets.
* **Whether Mr. Trump imposes tariffs, and if so how quickly.** Much of the campaign rhetoric was directed against the US' trading partners, most particularly Mexico and China. We need to see how this translates into action, if, or when, he looks to renegotiate NAFTA, and whether he labels China as a currency manipulator.
* **The results of the Italian referendum.** Although not directly linked to the US, the Italian referendum represents the next litmus test of the rise in voter popularity for anti-establishment candidates or causes. While we do not expect the outcome of the Italian referendum to have a major impact on markets, another setback for the political mainstream could cause jitters ahead of Dutch, French, and German elections next year. Our Short Term Investment Opportunities team is long German Bunds against French OATS as a hedge against rising concerns.

## Tactical asset allocation

In our tactical asset allocation we open an overweight position in the euro relative to the US dollar. Valuation and positioning suggest the US dollar has room to fall further.

* We continue to **overweight US equities relative to high grade bonds**. Fundamentals should outweigh political uncertainty, as private consumption remains solid and companies continue to benefit from easy financial conditions. We forecast corporate earnings per share growth to rise from 1% this year to 8% next.
* We also maintain our **overweight in emerging market equities relative to Swiss stocks**, and our **overweight in an emerging market currency basket**. Key drivers include overall accommodative monetary policy and low yields in advanced economies, undemanding valuations in EM currencies, and some improvement of fundamentals in the developing world. Should global financial market volatility rise further from here, we think a declining chance of a Fed December rate hike would help to limit the downside for EM currencies. Meanwhile, we will closely monitor policy announcements of the new US administration, for indications of measures that could weigh on global trade and growth. We will also look for signs of shifting geopolitical relations between the US and Russia.
* We'd expect our **overweight in US TIPS relative to high grade bonds** to benefit from the election result. Donald Trump's platform has an inflationary bias: his fiscal policy is likely to be expansionary, and he leans toward protectionism, which is inflationary due to the effects of tariffs and curtailed immigration. Both trends should support inflation-linked bonds, therefore making them even more attractive than they would otherwise be.
* Finally, we **add an overweight position in the euro relative to the US dollar**. The euro is around 12% undervalued relative to purchasing power parity based on our estimates. We believe there are indications that the Fed may be falling behind the curve in raising interest rates – wages are growing at the fastest pace in more than five years, and inflation stands at a two-year high. These trends will potentially be exacerbated if the Fed allows for a more “high pressure” economy over an extended period. Meanwhile, economic fundamentals in the Eurozone continue to improve, and the European Central Bank remains likely to taper its quantitative easing program in 2017.


## Additional investment ideas


* **Buy US financials and health care**. With the Republican party in control of both the White House and Congress these sectors stand to benefit from lower regulatory risks. Financials could also get a boost if interest rates continue to move higher as the markets focus on the reflationary aspects of Trump's likely policies. Within health care, pharmaceuticals stand to benefit from a lower risk of drug price controls, and from the repatriation of overseas cash. We are overweight both sectors in our US equity sector strategy.
* **Buy US senior loans.** Expected fiscal stimulus from a Trump presidency should be positive for US economic growth, and boost US inflation. Both factors may lead to a steepening in US sovereign yield curves, which is a favorable development for floating-rate senior loans. The asset class has held its ground even through recent market turbulence, losing just 0.2% in the last bout of volatility. And specific loan issuers, especially in the energy and financial services sectors, may benefit from less stringent regulation. Senior loans form a core part of our Global Credit Opportunities portfolio, which offers the potential for recurring income in a low-yield investment environment without allocating to more volatile equity investments. US senior loans is one of our highlighted themes.
* **Buy infrastructure-related investments.** Mr. Trump has pledged to modernise the US' infrastructure throughout his campaign and reiterated his commitment to increasing infrastructure spending in his acceptance speech earlier today. This was also one of the few bipartisan issues during the election campaign, and comes at a time when the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates around a fifth of US roads are in poor or mediocre condition, and around 67,000 US bridges are structurally deficient. This suggests potential future benefits for investments exposed to higher fixed asset investment spending, provided Mr. Trump is able to implement his spending plans.
* **Buy cyber security stocks.** We expect the industry to get a further boost under Trump's presidency as he has repeatedly vowed to strengthen the cyber security infrastructure of both the US government and corporates. The cyber security allocation in the US federal budget has already increased from USD 12.6bn in fiscal year (FY) 2015 to USD 19bn in FY 2017. But we expect the broad-based momentum to continue, as we envisage tighter security regulations in the future. Cyber security is part of our broader Security and Safety Longer Term Investment theme.
* **Buy platinum and palladium.** Gold acted as a hedge in the immediate aftermath of a Trump victory, rallying 4.7%. We like platinum and palladium which stand to gain from safe-haven flows related to any future concerns around US policy or the Italian referendum, but are also supported by rising auto sales and industrial production. Industrially-oriented precious metals is a highlighted theme.
* **Sell Eurozone consumer discretionary companies.** 2017 consensus earnings estimates for the consumer discretionary (CD) sector appear too high in our view. And fear of increased protectionism is likely to dent the European automobile sector’s earnings prospects. A weaker US dollar against the euro would also hurt the luxury goods sector. We are underweight Eurozone consumer discretionary companies in our European sector allocation.",finance,1478730503
personalfinance,Advice needed! Liens placed on property inherited by my sister and I. It is a roadblock in refinancing the 7% interest rate.,"HI PF. I will try and keep this long story short.

My Mom passed away in 2012 and my sister and I inherited the mortgage on our childhood home. At the time, my mother owed about 57K on the house. 

She also had about 30k in unresolved credit card debt. The attorney we used at the time let us know we were not responsible and we wrapped everything up and though it was done with.

Currently, we have about 47K left on the mortgage and at 7% deemed refinancing way overdue. All was going well until we learned that a lien and a claim on the probate were placed on the house. At the time of her passing, she had no assets, no cash in a bank account, not a thing but credit cards. I have also learned that the claim was placed after the home was transferred to my sister and I, and I am waiting to hear back on the lien. 

My question is - is it time to lawyer up? I have been in communication with one (Ascension Point for Citibank) of the two (BOA) companies. I send them an itemized list of the debts she had and a copy of the deed showing that their claim was made post property transfer. We understand that we do not have to pay this debt our of pocket but what is the best way to get these companies to let us be and continue with our refinancing?

I deeply appreciate your advice and all the tips and inspiration I have gotten from this sub already. It has aided me in not going down the path my mother did.

personalfinance,Help with Debt vs Retirement Investments,"My wife and I, both age 27, have loads of debt and I'm looking for advice on how to handle it.
First, our financials:
We bring home about $7500 a month (and sometimes more with our second jobs). Our recurring monthly expenses are about $6000 plus another $1000 thay goes towards a retirement account ($500), auto transfer to a liquid savings account ($300), and Digit ($300ish, like more liquid savings; we use this money for vacation and home remodels / projects). This leaves about $500 extra per month, give or take (depending on planned events for any given month).
Now for debt:
My wife has $30,000 in student debt at around a 5.3% average interest rate; I have $30,000 around a 5% interest rate and will be adding another $5,000 as I finish out my MBA next summer. Current minimum payments for my account is $0 while I'm in school, but I'm paying $195 to cover interest and some; my wife's minimum is around $300, but we pay $1000. Student loan repayment is factored into monthly expenses above.
We also have two car loans. One with 0% interest @ $589/mo until Jan 2021 with minimum payments, and another with 2.49% interest at $350/mo (I pay $400) until July 2020. The car loan payments are factored into monthly expenses above (if you're keeping track, student and car loans total $2,000, partially by choice given higher repayment toward student loans).
We also have a 30 year mortgage at 3.25%, and our payment is $815 (purchase price of $125k, plus insurance and PMI).
ZERO CREDIT CARD DEBT.
Now, our current situation:
We have over $22,000 in a savings account, which is almost enough to cover bare minimums for 6 months (bare minimums for each month is closer to $4k a month). We have almost $8,000 in a savings account, and our Digit balance is about $1,500 (we just drained it from over $5k to redo our kitchen).
The roth will be maxed out this year, but my wife doesn't have a retirement account, so I'm planning to dump $5500 into a roth ira at the end of the year (2016).
Now for my questions:
Are we doing this right? Should we be investing more in our future (retirement investing at a younger age) than pouring into student loans that I don't forecast paying off until the end of 2021)? Should I reduce liquid savings and pay chunks towards debt to get that down and risk it (I work in IT and my wife is a teacher.. we have have stable jobs)? Should I refinance my student loans with a company like SoFi.com to get a lower rate (we have excellent credit - at or above 800)?
I'm sure I have more questions, but let's start here. If I left out any important details let me know in the comments. Thanks in advance for your input!",finance,1478741218

* Leave the old 401k account where it is, allow it to accrue value only based on the T. Rowe Price age time set (for the next 40 years)

* roll over into a CD, or IRA at my current workplace (not ideal as i'd likely be losing money just from inflation)

* Roll over into our Investment side, where I am being told i can move it fee free so long as as it's moved ""in kind"" and where it won't be subject to admin fees (or so i'm told)

My wife and I are first time home buyers, living in SF. We're looking at buying a SFH in the city for probably around $1.2M for a 2BR/3BR, depending on area. We're looking to stay for the next 7-10 years or so.

**Gross Income**
Me: $210k this year. Going up to an estimated $285k next year
Wife: $170k this year. Probably marginal increase next year (let's just assume same at $170k)
Total: $380k this year, $455k next year

**Savings**
Combined, we have about $150k in savings accounts at 1% interest that we've been setting aside for part of a down payment. An additional $200k in brokerage account (liquidable). $150k in 401k (we're both 28, for reference).

**Expenses**
We're currently renting a 1BR/1BA for $3450/month. Other than that, we just have a 0.9% car loan with a monthly payment of $315 dollars ($8500 remaining on loan). I estimate our gross income to go 1/3 to taxes  (federal + state), 1/3 to expenses and 1/3 to savings (realize that there is room to decrease expenses and increase savings).

I've run our numbers through a bunch of the calculators. The NYT rent or buy calculator suggests we buy. The 1/3 gross income rule of thumb I've seen raised here has us under or right around ($380k x 3.3 = $1.15M). We may have to liquidate a few stocks in our brokerage account but have enough for a 20% down payment (alternatively, our mortgage broker offered a product that only requires 15% down with no PMI). All the facts I've seen so far seem to indicate that this is feasible, but the thought of taking out a ~$1M mortgage is pretty intimidating. We both grew up in areas where $400k houses were mansions.

The only debts I have other than my student loans are a mortgage and a car lease.

&amp;nbsp;

Private loans with Navient (Total $38,254): &amp;nbsp;

$21,085 @ 3.625% &amp;nbsp;

$11,785 @ 9.625% &amp;nbsp;

$5,384  @ 12.125% &amp;nbsp;

Currently Paying: $320 monthly ($110 to principal, $210 to interest)

&amp;nbsp;

Federal loans with Nelnet (Total $20,845): &amp;nbsp;

$11,263 @ 6.55% &amp;nbsp;

$3,207 @ 5.35% &amp;nbsp;

$6,375 @ 3.15% &amp;nbsp;

Currently Paying: $277 monthly ($180 to principal, $97 to interest)

&amp;nbsp;

401k Balance: $11,015 (I contribute 5%, which my employer matches. Average $600 added to 401k monthly. All of it in Fidelity Freedom K 2055 blended funds.)

&amp;nbsp;

So I've been weighing the idea of borrowing the $5,384 from my 401k to completely payoff the 12.125% interest rate disbursement I have with Navient. 

My thoughts so far are that it would be worth it because the amount of interest that accrues on the student loan monthly (approx $55)  would be much more than what I would gain in 401k accrual in pretty much any decent time frame and allow me to start making a lot more headway on my other disbursements. Also Fidelity said the charge for borrowing from my 401k would be $110. 

&amp;nbsp;

I can afford to pay another $100 or so per month going forward to pay back the borrowing from the 401k. So I wouldn't be decreasing my monthly payment to Navient, the $65 or so total that was going towards that disbursement would just go towards the principal of the other disbursements.

&amp;nbsp;

Is my reasoning correct or is there something I'm overlooking/not aware of that would make this a bad decision? Furthermore, would it be a good idea to do this again down the road on the 9.625% interest rate loan as well?

&amp;nbsp;

If there's any additional info I should provide, just let me know. I appreciate any insight and all time used to help me out, thank you in advance.",finance,1478771759

worldpolitics,Can the real Donald Trump [USA President elect] be understood from Mr Sean Hannity's visions ?,"1] The details of Corporations run by Donald Trump which have filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, like a black box, have not been given much public transparency : Hillary Clinton mentioned the topic in a speech, 21st June 2016, and the site politifact.com [ a Linda Qiu review] affirmed 6 Trump Corporations that went under.

The Donald Trump headline mythology is one thing, but the revelations on Chapter 11 bankruptcies doesn't read like a Bill Gates persona story, guiding a Microsoft Corporation track record.

2] Trump also eluded successfully, revealing his tax records prior to the election. Why ? Plenty of reading time has been devoted by clever enablers to appease this subject. Is the ""no tax"" for nearly two decades true ?  How many USA Presidential nominees have refused to let ""the People"" know their tax affairs as a condition in accepting a Presidential nomination ? What are the consequences for ""the People"" on the basis of ""trust me"" ?

3] Donald Trump was quoted as never to have had dealings with
Russian go-betweens who were linked closely to Moscow/Kremlin persons, especially those on the western sanctions list, after Pres. Putin invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, early 2014.

 North Korea [a gulag state] supported this territorial grab in Eastern Europe. Opposed, were USA and other western nations [about 100 allies] have extended economic sanctions, with agreement by many USA Republican Congressional officials.

But TrumpSoHo, from about 2006, was financed apparently by the Bayrock Group LLC, and figures like Moscow born Felix Sater.

Then there is Donald Trump's ""policy advisor"", Carter Page, a pro Putin ideologue, linked with the Moscow Bank, and Gazprom, the Kremlin run oil/gas giant.

Tip of the iceberg stuff. Investigative journalism is dangerous business, but maybe a ""George S. Patton"" type of journalist person, might engage some breakthroughs, and get behind the Wikileaks ""fed by the Kremlin hackers"", on a timely anti Dem Party agenda.

4] The People deserve to escape the inequalities [eg the research of economist Joseph Stiglitz is helpful], which has crippled many USA families, over recent decades. Understandably they voted for a ""change"" in Washington. 

Can this ""trickle down"" approach work under a Trump administration, given the millions of corporations who are currently registered in ""tax havens"" like the Virgin &amp; Cayman Islands, outside the tax law jurisdiction of USA or other nations ?
What is the $US value of assets, which apparently ""don't exist"" on the books which generate income tax ? Could this be over $US 20 Trillion ? 

5] Has Donald Trump heard of the Magnitsky Act [USA],
and the Russian story behind the money, if the values of liberty and democracy are to be protected by ""The People"".

6] Given the power of social media and followers of Republican enthusiasts such as Mr Sean Hannity, how will they reach out to western nation state democracies, who are fearful of gulag/KGB trained national dictatorships ? 

Are we in for a dose of ""appeasements"" which have had an ugly history [eg the Molotov-Ribbentrop era when the Gestapo and the pre KGB, were on the same side in WWII]. 

Ask a Russian when WWII started, during any opportunity. 
Their answer will be 22nd June 1941.

Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said ""the aim of generating the model was to see what profits the blockchain technology could provide and where the risks might lie"".  Payment processing was between the Bank of Canada and R3, a New York-based research consortium that includes all of Canada's major banks, also worked on the project.  Blockchain grants consumers to administer secure negotiations with each other without the need for third party approval or central authority, unlike traditional electronic funds transmissions.

The Bank of Canada had been working with commercial banks to establish the experimental interbank payment operations.  A slide from a demonstration viewed by Reuters at the time programmed the banks in the experiment would agree cash collateral in a pool that the Bank of Canada would convert into a digital version.  The digital currency would then be used as a medium of exchange and could be converted back to cash.  However, national currencies are center to financial stability and the transmission mechanism for monetary approach.  With bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it turned out to be still more of a commodity rather than a money itself as a fundamental means of transacting for people in this room.  Virtual currencies and electronic cash in general was still of interest to the bank because it could in a future scenario change the ability of central banks to control short-term interest rates relying on how the cash was valued.

Various banks seemed promising but I had to open an account with them and become a customer for them to better know be and offer me things like this.

The lender denied any changes in the interest rate.

Does anyone have any suggestions? The only thing I can think about doing now is using my current capital and paying down the principal however I would also like to have the cash as savings instead of simply paying off this last big debt.",finance,1478790909
stocks,What to Do When Your Stock Doesn’t Move,"There is a big difference between a 'dead money' stock and a 'melting ice cube.' You can afford to stay invested in a profitable business with a stagnant stock price

Sometimes stocks don’t move much.

I own a stock called George Risk Industries (RSKIA). I’ve owned it for – I think – a little over six years now. It’s done fine. It was more expensive at one point than it is now. But there has never been a catalyst with this stock. It has earned about what I expected it to earn each year. It’s paid a good dividend yield of 4% or 5% a year. And any earnings beyond that have just piled up in cash.

At the time I bought the stock, I think it was trading around $4.50 a share and had about $4.50 a share in cash and investments. Money in mutual funds. That sort of thing. So, you were getting the business for free. And it was a profitable business. It earned – or would earn, in normal times (not 2010) – maybe 40 cents a share.


Well, over the last six years, the stock has paid dividends. And the yield on the stock has been higher than the yield on a government bond would be. It has piled up maybe a little more cash. We are talking maybe $5 to $6 a share in cash and investments now. But that is largely the result of things like mutual funds going up in value.

So you’ve gotten your dividend. And the cash box part of the business – again, it’s not really cash (it’s investments) – has grown a bit along with the market. But you are still talking about a stock where the operating business is not selling for much of anything above the value of what the company has on its balance sheet. So, say the stock goes for $7.25 a share. Say the company has $5.50 to $6 a share in net cash and investments. Then the value the market puts on the business – which might be earning 40 cents pre-tax – is somewhere between $1.25 and $1.75. Less than 5 times pre-tax profits. I am using round figures. The stock is illiquid. It often moves in increments as big as 25 cents whenever there’s a trade. And then the fair market value of the investments obviously moves constantly. So the numbers are a little different with every 10-Q.

But, you see the situation. It hasn’t outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the six years I’ve owned it. Now, personally, I’m okay with that. The S&amp;P 500 was cheap to fairly valued from 2010 through about 2012. The last three years it’s been expensive. A lot more expensive than George Risk. So, I’ve never been tempted to sell the stock unless I found something better to buy. And I’ve yet to find something better to buy. And so I’ve held on. But, nothing much has happened with the stock for about six years.

So, are we talking about a value trap?

In this case, perhaps not. And that is because the stock is profitable. It is safe and it is profitable both. The operating business has always turned a profit. And the company has always had a ton of net cash and investments. Liabilities are close to nil. There’s no debt. So, it’s safe and profitable. Those are not the traits of a true value trap. The stock isn’t a melting ice cube. But, it can be dead money. How long is too long to wait for a position to work out?

This isn’t an issue you only have to worry about with illiquid stocks. I own a very liquid stock – Frost (NYSE:CFR) – that has something of the same issue. I was talking to someone who owns a lot of Frost shares in his portfolio (bought because I talked to him about that stock a year back) and he went on and on about how the stock had been doing the last couple months or so – where it was finally moving. So, I had to tell him: “That doesn’t mean anything. Ignore it. It’s just because of the Fed.” The stock moves a lot on short-term expectations of when exactly the Fed will raise rates.

Now, Frost is a very, very interest rate-sensitive bank. The two most interest rate-sensitive banks I know of are probably Frost and Bank of Hawaii (NYSE:BOH). They both are funded almost entirely by customer deposits. And they both pay very little interest on those deposits. Most importantly, they both have huge amounts of deposits per branch. So their operating expense (non-interest expense) as a percent of deposits is very low.

In a high interest rate environment, these banks would have much higher returns on equity than the average bank. In a near-zero environment, a lot of banks will all earn about a 10% ROE regardless of how valuable their deposit base is.

So buying Bank of Hawaii and Frost – and I do suggest you buy both if you don’t own them already – is a speculation on interest rates. But it’s not much of a speculation on when the Fed raises rates. What I mean by this is easier to explain if you think about the George Risk example. I bought George Risk in 2010 and still own the stock in 2016. Now, imagine I buy Frost stock this year and hold it as long as I’ve held George Risk. I’d still own the stock in 2022. So my speculation is on where the Fed Funds Rate will be in six years rather than six months. That’s my bet. But the stock doesn’t move based on the bet. Day to day, week to week, and month to month – Frost shares are reacting to where investors think the Fed will have rates in May of 2016, not November of 2022. They are thinking six months ahead, not six years ahead.

In this kind of situation, what should you do? Imagine you bought Frost a year or two ago. Unemployment was already quite low. You might have expected the Fed Funds Rate to be higher by now than it is. So you’ve been sitting there in disappointment – just waiting without a catalyst – for a year or two now. It can feel like the Fed will never raise rates.

I remember facing the same situation with oil prices. A few years back, I was talking to the co-writer of a newsletter I did about researching cruise line stocks. I wanted to research Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) as possible stock picks. The reason for doing this was simple. Carnival and Royal Caribbean weren’t earning much. Their ROE was poor. But they were paying a lot for fuel. And when you looked at their results before fuel expenses – they hadn’t diminished the way their overall financial results appeared to. In other words, something the companies couldn’t control – oil prices – was causing their EPS to look worse now than it had in the past.

The next question was whether oil prices were “normal.” At this time, Brent was over $100 a barrel. That obviously wasn’t normal. It might be reasonable to do an analysis of a cruise line with $70 Brent as your assumed cost input. And it might be reasonable to do an analysis of a cruise line with $30 Brent as your assumed cost input. More than $100 a barrel made no sense. You could develop new sources of oil – people were in Texas and elsewhere in the U.S. – for much less than $100 a barrel. This was not difficult to see.

But there was a problem. Oil was – at that moment – priced above $100 a barrel. There was nothing in my investment case for Carnival and Royal Caribbean that would start benefitting shareholders till oil prices dropped. So, it was a speculation on oil prices. I had no problem with saying that $70 oil was reasonable and $100 oil was unreasonable. That was a speculation I was comfortable making. So, I suggested we do a report ignoring the fact that oil was $100 and using $70 as our cost input in the analysis. This is the Ben Graham approach. True earnings normalization. It made sense to me. But, my co-writer was reluctant. And I think subscribers would have been very, very reluctant to embrace the idea. Why? Because oil wasn’t $70 a barrel. It was more than $100 a barrel. How could you ignore that reality? How could you just fast forward to a future that is – as any future must be – speculative?

I think we can only invest for normal times. You may want to short Chipotle because you think same store sales will continue to decline. Another investor may want to buy Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) because he believes same-store sales will recover. The one thing that makes no sense is to take today’s sales and use today’s operating margin as normal. Either sales will decline, and the operating margin will get much, much worse. Or sales will improve, and the operating margin will recover to the kind of levels that were normal in the past. I have no opinion on Chipotle. Except I do have the opinion that looking at the stock’s 2016 sales and earnings makes no sense. Those figures are irrelevant. This isn’t a normal year for Chipotle.

When oil is $100 a barrel, I think you can say it is not a normal year for airlines, or cruise lines, or oil companies. And you can safely disregard the current year’s EPS. It doesn’t matter. The same is true for Frost and Bank of Hawaii. It doesn’t matter what they report in EPS for 2016. The Fed Funds Rate is much lower now than it will be in a normal year. So, we don’t need to pay attention to their earnings.

This approach might make sense to you. I hope it does. Because it’s the only approach that makes sense to me. Investing on the assumption that $100 oil or 0% interest rates or anything as abnormal as all that will last sounds odder to me than investing in a company that has never turned a profit. We – as value investors – don’t do that. But even we know that a growing company that has never turned a profit will – if its gross profit margin is sufficiently high – eventually generate profits at some future size. It is a theoretically sustainable trajectory. Oil at $100 a barrel or interest rates at 0% are not sustainable. But, we don’t know when these “bubbles” will burst – do we?

So, it is easy to think this way in the finding and buying stage. It is easy to believe in Frost before you buy Frost. It becomes harder if say you expect the Fed will raise rates in December and then they don’t. That would be a surprise, wouldn’t it? And it might cause some short-term problems for the stock. You’re a value investor – not a value trader. So, short-term problems aren’t a problem for you. But, what if the Fed doesn’t raise rates through all of 2017? How would you feel then? Would it feel like a short-term problem? Or would it feel like you had invested in a dead money stock?

There is nothing wrong with a dead money stock. There is something wrong with a melting ice cube. I have owned both. And there’s a big difference between say George Risk and Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:BKS). Barnes &amp; Noble was always going to have a declining business. I bought into it on the assumption that the free cash flow its stores were producing could be used to pay dividends, buy back stock or acquire an unrelated, non-print book business. It was also possible that Ron Burkle would win his proxy fight with Len Riggio. Burkle lost. And I sold the stock soon after that proxy vote. Why? Because Barnes &amp; Noble was doubling down on Nook. Unlike the retail stores, Nook wasn’t a shrinking business – it was a money-losing business. It burned cash. And so, the safety of my investment was at risk. This wasn’t a dead money investment. It was a melting ice cube. It was a value trap.

The right time to sell a melting ice cube is as soon as possible. The right time to sell a dead money stock is only when you find something better. A dead money stock is still cheap.

In the newsletter I used to write, we picked a stock called Breeze-Eastern (BZC). It was a small business. Three investment funds owned most of the company. Their positions were illiquid. They couldn’t easily sell out to the public. So, not surprisingly in hindsight, they sold out to a 100% control buyer. But, until that moment, Breeze-Eastern seemed to have no catalyst. When the deal was announced, it was no longer dead money. A few months earlier, the biggest question people asked us about Breeze-Eastern was, “What if nothing ever happens with the stock?” Then it turns out like George Risk.

Obviously, it is better to find a Breeze-Eastern than a George Risk. But it’s not always easy to know the difference between a Breeze-Eastern and a George Risk. It’s easy to know the difference between a George Risk and a Frost and a Barnes &amp; Noble. The risks are different. The risk of losing money should always be a top concern. The risk of having to wait six years and still not have much to show for your investment – that’s a risk value investors can afford to take.

Currently owe $24,848 at an interest rate of 2.84%. We pay $534.73/mo and are 22 months into our 72 month loan. 

We got approved on a new loan for the same amount at rate 2.45% for 78 months. The payments would be lowered to $388.77. 

The plan would be to continue paying $534 to get ahead of the new loan and finish paying it off. Like I said at the start, I'm not sure if it's worth it. The lower interest is slightly lower and it seems we'd be extending the loan an additional 2 years (that is if started paying $388.77).

stocks,Perpetual Option: Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZM),"In his book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius, Greenblatt talks about using LEAPs to make leveraged bets.  The book included his trade in Wells Fargo (WFC, another topic for a future post, I suppose).

But sometimes, stocks get down so cheap that they become priced like options.  In the Genius book, the WFC LEAPs were priced at $14 while the stock was at around $77.

Here, we have a hedge fund manager trading less than $3.00/share, which is a typical price for regular options, not even LEAPs. Of course, all stocks are options on the residual value of businesses. But sometimes things are priced for either a large gain or zero, just like an option.

I call this a perpetual option, but that reminds me of those lifetime warranties.  Like, who's lifetime? The manufacturer's? The store's? Yours? Nothing is forever, so I guess there really is no such thing as a perpetual option.  But anyway...

Och-Ziff IPO'ed in 2007 at $32/share and traded in the mid $20's right before the crisis, then down to below $5.00 during the crisis and back up to the mid-teens.  I've been watching this since the IPO and looked at it again when it was trading around $10/share.  It's down quite a bit since then.  I didn't own it back then but I did take a small bite down at $5.00/share.

I have mentioned other private equity and hedge fund managers here in the past but haven't owned most of them because of the amount of money that seemed to be going into alternatives.  I was just worried that the AUM's of all of these alternative managers were going up so quickly that I couldn't imagine them earning the high returns that made everyone rush to them in the first place. Look at the presentation of any of these alternative managers and their AUM growth is just staggering.

Extremely Contrarian
We investors walk around and think about all sorts of things; look at store traffic, taste new foods/restaurant concepts, count how many Apple watches people are wearing (I recently biked around the city with my kid (Brooklyn to Central Park, around the park (around the big loop) and all the way downtown back to Brooklyn (30+ miles) and I think I counted two Apple watches that I saw compared to countless iPhones. And this was in the summer so no coats or long sleeves to hide wrists).

And a couple of the things that we tend to think about are,
What does everybody absolutely love, and what are they 100% sure of (other than that Hillary will win the election and that the market will crash if Trump wins), and 
What do people absolutely, 100% hate and don't even want to talk about? 
In the investing world right now, it seems like the one thing that everybody seems to agree with is that active investing is dead (OK, not completely true because we active investors never really lose faith in it).  The data points to it (active managers underperforming for many years, legendary stock pickers too not performing all too well, star hedge funds not doing well etc...).  The money flows point to it (cash flowing out of active managers and into passive funds, boom in index funds / ETFs; this reminds me of the 1990's when there were more mutual funds than listed companies.  There are probably more ETFs now than listed companies). Sentiment points to it (stars and heroes now are ETF managers, quants etc.).

By the Way
Oh, and by the way, in case people say that it is no longer possible due to this or that reason for humans to outperform indices or robots, I would just say that we have seen this before.  Things in finance are cyclical and we've seen this movie before.

From the 1985 Berkshire Hathaway Letter,
Most institutional investors in the early 1970s, on the other hand, regarded business value as of only minor relevance when they were deciding the prices at which they would buy or sell.  This now seems hard to believe.  However, these institutions were then under the spell of academics at prestigious business schools who were preaching newly-fashioned theory: the stock market was totally efficient, and therefore calculations of business value -- and even thought, itself -- were of no importance in investment activities.  (We are enormously indebted to those academics: what could be more advantageous in an intellectual contest -- whether it be bridge, chess or stock selection than to have opponents who have been taught that thinking is a waste of energy?)

What Do People Hate?
So, back to what people absolutely hate.  People hate active managers.  It's not even stocks that they are not interested in.  They hate active managers.  Nobody outperforms and their fees are not worth it. What else do they hate?  They hate hedge funds.  I don't need to write a list here, but you just keep reading one institution after another reducing their exposure to hedge funds. There is a massive shakeout going on now with money leaving hedge funds. Others like Blackstone argues that this is not true; assets are just moving out of mediocre hedge funds and moving into theirs.

This is a theme I will be going back to in later posts, but for now I am just going to look at OZM. 

OZM
OZM is a well-known hedge fund firm so I won't go into much detail here.  To me, it's sort of a conventional equity-oriented hedge fund that runs strategies very typical of pre-Volcker rule Wall Street investment banks; equity long/short, merger arb, convertible arb etc.  They have been expanding into credit and real estate with decent results.  But a lot of their AUM is still in the conventional equity strategies.

What makes OZM interesting now is that chart from the Pzena Investment report (see here). These charts make it obvious why active managers have had such a hard time.  The value spread has just continued to widen since 2004/2005 through now.  Cheap stocks get cheaper and expensive stocks get more so. You can see how this sort of environment could be the worst for long/short strategies (and value-oriented long strategies, and even naked short strategies for that matter).  Things have just been going the wrong way with no mean reversion.

But if you look at where those charts are now, you can see that it is probably exactly the wrong time to give up on value strategies or value-based long/short strategies; in fact it looks like the best time ever to be looking at these strategies.

Seeing that, does it surprise me that many pension funds are running the other way? Not at all.  Many large institutions chase performance and not future potential.

Conceptually speaking, they would rather buy a stock at 80x P/E that has gone up 30%/year in the past five years that is about to tank rather than buy an 8x P/E stock that has gone nowhere in the past five years but is about to take off; they are driven by historic (or recent historic) performance.

OZM Performance
Anyway, let's look at the long term performance of OZM. This excludes their credit and real estate funds which are doing much better and are growing AUM. 

This is their performance since 1994 through the end of 2015:

OZM fund	S&amp;P500
1994	28.50%	5.30%
1995	23.50%	27.40%
1996	27.40%	23.00%
1997	26.70%	33.40%
1998	11.10%	28.60%
1999	18.80%	21.00%
2000	20.60%	-9.10%
2001	6.30%	-11.90%
2002	-1.60%	-22.10%
2003	24.00%	28.70%
2004	11.10%	10.90%
2005	8.80%	4.90%
2006	14.80%	15.80%
2007	11.50%	5.50%
2008	-15.90%	-37.00%
2009	23.10%	26.50%
2010	8.50%	15.10%
2011	-0.50%	2.10%
2012	11.60%	16.00%
2013	13.90%	32.40%
2014	5.50%	13.70%
2015	-0.40%	1.40%
5 year avg	5.85%	12.57%
10 year avg	6.69%	7.32%
Since 1994	12.05%	8.87%
Since 2000	7.59%	5.01%
Since 2007	5.14%	6.53%

So they have not been doing too well, but it's really only the last couple of years that don't look too good.  Their ten-year return through 2013 was +8.2%/year versus +7.4%/year for the S&amp;P 500 index. It's pretty obvious that their alpha has been declining over time.

For those who want more up-to-date figures, I redid the above table to include figures through September-end 2016.  And instead of 5 year and 10 year returns, I use 4.75-year and 9.75-year returns; I thought that would be more comparable than saying 5.75-year and 10.75-year, and I didn't want to dig into quarterly figures to get actual 5 and 10s.


OZM fund	S&amp;P500
1994	28.50%	5.30%
1995	23.50%	27.40%
1996	27.40%	23.00%
1997	26.70%	33.40%
1998	11.10%	28.60%
1999	18.80%	21.00%
2000	20.60%	-9.10%
2001	6.30%	-11.90%
2002	-1.60%	-22.10%
2003	24.00%	28.70%
2004	11.10%	10.90%
2005	8.80%	4.90%
2006	14.80%	15.80%
2007	11.50%	5.50%
2008	-15.90%	-37.00%
2009	23.10%	26.50%
2010	8.50%	15.10%
2011	-0.50%	2.10%
2012	11.60%	16.00%
2013	13.90%	32.40%
2014	5.50%	13.70%
2015	-0.40%	1.40%
2016*	1.10%	7.80%
4.75 year	6.53%	14.58%
9.75 year	5.48%	6.72%
Since 1994	11.68%	8.92%
Since 2000	7.29%	5.27%
Since 2007	4.82%	6.86%

So over time, they have good outperformance, but much of that is from the early years.  As they get bigger, it's not hard to see why their spread would shrink.

They are seriously underperforming in the 4.75 year, but that's because the S&amp;P 500 index was coming off of a big bear market low and OZM didn't lose that much money, so I think that is irrelevant, especially for a long/short fund.

More relevant would be figures from recent market peaks which sort of shows a through-the-cycle performance.  Since the market peak in 2000, OZM has outperformed with a gain of +7.3%/year versus +5.3%/year for the S&amp;P, but they have underperformed since the 2007 peak.  A lot of this probably has to do with the previous charts about how value spreads have widened throughout this period.

I would actually want to be increasing exposure to this area that hasn't worked well since 2007.  Some of this, of course, is due to lower interest rates.  Merger arb, for example, is highly dependent on interest rates as are other arbitrage type trades. (The less risk there is, the closer to the short term interest rate the return is going to be.)

One thing that makes me scratch my head, though, in the 3Q 2016 10-Q is the following:
OZ Master Fund’s merger arbitrage, convertible and derivative arbitrage, corporate credit and structured credit strategies have each generated strong year-to-date gains through September 30, 2016. In merger arbitrage, certain transactions in which OZ Master Fund participated closed during the third quarter, contributing to the strategy’s year-to-date gross return of +1.3%. Convertible and derivative arbitrage generated a gross return of +0.5% during the third quarter, driven by gains in convertible arbitrage positions, commodity-related volatility, commodity spreads and index volatility spread trades. Year-to-date, convertible and derivative arbitrage has generated a gross return of +1.3%. In OZ Master Fund’s credit-related strategies, widening credit spreads and certain event-driven situations added +0.4% to the gross return within corporate credit during the third quarter, while in structured credit, a +0.9% gross return during the quarter was attributable to the realization of recoveries in certain of our idiosyncratic situations. Year-to-date, the corporate credit and structured credit strategies are each up +1.2% on a gross basis.
Gross returns of less than 2% are described as ""strong"".  Hmm... I may be missing something here.  Maybe it is 'strong' versus comparable strategies.  I don't know. Anyway, moving on...

Greenblatt Genius Strategies
Oh yeah, and by the way, OZM is one of the funds that are heavily into the yellow book strategies. Here's a description of their equity long/short strategy:
Long/short equity special situations, which consists of fundamental long/short and event-driven investing. Fundamental long/short investing involves analyzing companies and assets to profit where we believe mispricing or undervaluation exists. Event-driven investing attempts to realize gain from corporate events such as spin-offs, recapitalizations and other corporate restructurings, whether company specific or due to industry or economic conditions.



This is still a large part of their book, which is a good thing if you believe that the valuation spreads will mean revert and that Greenblatt's yellow book strategies are still valid.

One thing that may temper returns over time, though, is the AUM level.  What you can do with $1 billion in AUM is not the same as when you have $10 billion or $30 billion.  I don't think Greenblatt would have had such high returns if he let AUM grow too much.

This seems to be an issue with a lot of hedge funds. Many of the old stars who were able to make insane returns with AUM under $1 billion seem to have much lower returns above that level.

Here is OZM's AUM trend in the past ten years.  Some of the lower return may correlate to the higher AUM, not to mention higher AUM at other hedge funds too reducing spreads (and potential profits).




Just to refresh my memory, I grabbed the AUM chart from the OZM prospectus in 2007.  Their AUM was under $6 billion until the end of 2003 and then really grew to over $30 billion by 2007.



Their 10-year return through 2003 was 18%/year vs. 10.6%/year for the S&amp;P 500 index.

From the end of 2003 through the end of 2015, OZM's funds returned +7.2%/year versus +7.4%/year for the S&amp;P 500 index. So their alpha basically went from 7.4%/year outperformance to flat.

This is actually not so bad as these types of funds often offered 'equity-like' returns with lower volatility and drawdowns.  The long/short nature of OZM funds means that investors achieved the same returns as the S&amp;P 500 index without the full downside exposure. This is exactly what many institutions want, actually.

But still, did their growth in AUM dampen returns?  I think there is no doubt about that. These charts showing tremendous AUM growth is the reason why I never owned much of these alternative managers in the past few years I've been watching them. 

The question is how much of the lower returns are due to the higher AUM. Of course, some of this AUM growth is in other strategies so not all new AUM is squeezed into the same strategies.

Will OZM ever go back to the returns of the 1990's?  I doubt that.  First of all, that was a tremendous bull market.  Plus, OZM's AUM was much smaller so they had more opportunities to take advantage of yellow book ideas and other strategies.

Boom/Bubble Doesn't Mean It's a Bad Idea
By the way, another sort of tangent.  Just because there is a big boom or bubble in something doesn't necessarily make that 'something' a bad idea.  We had a stock market bubble in the late 1920's that ended badly, but owning parts of businesses never suddenly became a bad idea or anything.  It's just that you didn't want to overpay, or buy stocks for the wrong reasons.

We had a boom in the late 1990's in stocks that focused on picking stocks and owning them for the long term as exemplified by the Beardstown Ladies. Of course, the Beardstown Ladies didn't end well (basically a fraud), but owning good stocks for the long haul, I don't think, ever became a bad idea necessarily.

We had a tremendous housing bubble and various real estate bubbles in recent years. But again, owning good, solid assets at reasonable prices for the long haul never became a bad idea despite the occasional bubbles and collapses.

Similarly, hedge funds and alternative assets go through cycles too. I know many value investors are not with me here and will always hate hedge funds (like Buffett), but that's OK. 

We've had alternative cycles in the past.  Usually the pattern is that there is a bull market in stocks and people rush into stocks. The bull market inevitably ends and people lose money. Institutions not wanting to lose money rush into 'alternative' assets.  Eventually, the market turns and they rush back into equities.

I think something similar is happening now, but the cycle seems a bit elongated and, and the low interest rates is having an effect as alternatives are now attracting capital formerly allocated to fixed income. In the past, alternatives seemed more like an equity substitution, risk asset.

Valuation
OK, so what is OZM worth?

Well, a simple way of looking at it is that OZM has paid an average of $1.10/year in dividends in the last five years.   During the past five years, the funds returned around 6%/year, so it's not an upside outlier in terms of fund performance.

Put a 10x multiple on it and the stock is worth $11/share.

Another way to look at it is that the market is telling you that it is unlikely that OZM will enjoy the success even of the past five years over the next few years.  Assuming a scenario of failure (stock price = 0) or back to sort of past five years performance ($11), a $3.00 stock price reflects the odds of failure at 73% and only a 27% chance that OZM gets back to it's past five year average-like performance. Of course, OZM can just sort of keep doing what it's doing and stay at $3.00 for a long time too.

There is a problem with this, though, as the dividends don't reflect equity-based compensation expense; OZM gives out a bunch of RSU's every year.

To adjust for this, let's look at the economic earnings of the past five years including the costs of equity-based compensation.

Equity-based compensation expense not included in economic income is listed below ($000):

2008	102,025
2009	122,461
2010	128,737
2011	128,916
2012	86,006
2013	120,125
2014	104,344
2015	106,565

It's odd that this doesn't seem to correlate to revenues, income or AUM; it's just basically flat all the way through.

If we include this, economic income at OZM averaged around $520 million/year.  With fully diluted 520 million shares outstanding, that's around $1.00/share in economic earnings per share that OZM earned on average over the past five years.  So that's not too far off from the $1.10/share dividends we used above.

One of the interesting things about investing is when you find alternative ways to value something instead of just the usual price-to-book values, P/E ratios etc.

So how would you value this?

What about adjusting the implied odds from the above. What if we said there's a 50/50 chance of recovery or failure.  Let's say recovery is getting back to what it has done over the past five years on average, and failure is a zero on the stock.

50% x $0.00 + 50% x $10.00 = $5.00/share

In that case, OZM is worth $5.00/share, or 70% higher than the current price.   You are looking at a 60 cent dollar in that case.

Let's say there is a 70% chance of recovery.

70% x $10.00 + 30% x $0.00 = $7.00/share.

That's 130% higher, or a 40 cent dollar.

By the way, the AUM averaged around $37 billion over the past five years, and remember, their return was around 5.9%/year so these figures aren't based on huge, abnormal returns or anything.

As of the end of September 2016, AUM was $39.3 billion, and this went down to $37 billion as of November 1, 2016. OZM expects continued redemptions towards year-end both due to their Justice Department/SEC settlement and overall industry redemption trends.

The above ignored balance sheet items, but you can deduct $0.60/share, maybe, of negative equity, or more if you think they need more cash on the balance sheet to run their business.

Preferred Shares
As for the $400 million settlement amount and preferred shares, the settlement amount is already on the balance sheet as a liability (which was paid out after the September quarter-end).  The preferred shares were sold after the quarter ended.  They have zero interest for three years so I don't think it impacts the above analysis.  You would just add cash on the balance sheet and the preferreds on the liability side.

If you want to deduct the full amount of the settlement of $400 million, you can knock off $0.77/share off the above valuation instead of the $0.60/share.

Earnings Model
The problem with these companies is that it's impossible, really, to predict what their AUM is going to be in the future or their performance.  Of course, we can guess that if they do well, AUM will increase and vice-versa.

But still, as a sanity check, we should see how things look with various assumptions in terms of valuation.

First of all, let's look at 2015.  In the full year to 2015, a year that the OZM funds were down (master fund), they paid a dividend of $0.87.  Adjusted economic income was $240 million (economic income reported by OZM less equity-based comp expense) and using the current fully diluted shares outstanding of 520 million, that comes to $0.46/share. OK, it's funny to use current shares outstanding against last year's economic income, but I am trying to use last years' earnings as sort of a 'normalized' figure.

Using these figures from a bad year, OZM is current trading at a 29% dividend yield (using $3.00/share price) and 6.5x adjusted economic income. This would be 8.3x if you added the $0.77/share from the settlement above.

OK, so average AUM was $44 billion in 2015, so even in a bad year, they made tons in management fees.  Fine.  We'll get to that in a second.  AUM is $37 billion as of November 2016, and is probably headed down towards year-end.

2016 Year-to-Date
So let's look at how they are doing this year so far.  Fund performance-wise, it hasn't been too good, but they do remain profitable. These fund businesses are designed so that their fixed expenses are covered by their management fees.   Big bonuses are paid out only when the funds make money.

Anyway, let's look at 2016 so far in terms of economic income.

In the 3Q of 2016, economic income was $57.4 million. Equity-based compensation expense was $18.3 million so adjusted economic income was $39.1 million. Annualize that and you get $156 million. Using 520 million fully diluted shares (share amount used to calculate distributable earnings in the earnings press release), that comes to $0.30/share adjusted economic income.  So at $3.00/share, OZM is trading at 10x arguably depressed earnings.  (This excludes the  FCPA settlement amount). If you include $400 million of the FCPA preferreds (total to be offered eventually), then the P/E would actually be closer to 12.6x.

For the year to date, economic income was $195 million, and equity-based comp expense was $56 million so adjusted economic income was $139 million.  Again using 520 million shares, that comes to $0.25/share in adjusted economic earnings per share. Annualize that and you get $0.33/share.
So at $3.00/share, OZM is trading at 9x depressed earnings, or 11x including the FCPA preferred.

OK, so maybe this is not really 'depressed'.  With still a lot of AUM, it is possible that AUM keeps going down.

AUM was $37 billion in November, but let's say it goes down to $30 billion.  That's actually a big dip.  But let's say AUM goes down there.  And then let's assume 1% management fees, 20% incentive fees, and economic income margin of 50% (averaged 56% in past five years) and the OZM master fund return of 5%.

In this case, economic income would be $300 million.  Equity-based comp costs seems steady at around $100 million, so we deduct that to get adjusted economic income.  This comes to $200 million.

That comes to around $0.40/share. At $3.00/share, that's 7.5x adjusted economic earnings, or a 13% yield, or 9.4x and 10.6% yield including the FCPA preferreds.

So that's not bad.  We are assuming AUM dips to $30 billion and OZM funds only earn 5%/year, and with that assumption the stock is trading at this cheap level.

Things, of course, can get much worse. If performance doesn't improve, AUM will keep going down.  You can't really stress test these things as you can just say their returns will never recover and that's that.

On the other hand, any improvement can get you considerable upside.

If assets return to $40 billion and returns average 6% over time, economic income margin goes to 56% (average of past five years), adjust economic income per share is $0.76/share and the stock could be worth $7.60/share for more than a double.

Here's a matrix of possibilities.  Skeptics will say, where are the returns below 5% and AUM below $30 billion?!

Well, OK. If returns persist at lower than 5%, it's safe to assume that AUM will go down and this may well end up a zero.  That is certainly a possibility.  It wouldn't shock many for another hedge fund to shut down.

On the other hand, if things do stabilize, normalize and OZM recovers and does well, there is a lot of upside here. What is interesting to me is that the market is discounting a lot of bad and not pricing in much good.  This is when opportunities occur, right?



5%	6%	7%	8%	9%	10%
30,000	$0.45	$0.52	$0.58	$0.65	$0.71	$0.78
35,000	$0.56	$0.64	$0.71	$0.79	$0.86	$0.94
40,000	$0.67	$0.76	$0.84	$0.93	$1.01	$1.10
45,000	$0.78	$0.87	$0.97	$1.07	$1.16	$1.26
50,000	$0.88	$0.99	$1.10	$1.21	$1.32	$1.42
55,000	$0.99	$1.11	$1.23	$1.35	$1.47	$1.58
60,000	$1.10	$1.23	$1.36	$1.49	$1.62	$1.75


The row above is the assumed return of the OZM funds.  The left column is the AUM.  Assumptions are 1% management fee, 20% incentive fee, 56% economic income margin (excluding equity-based comp expense) and $100 million/year in equity-based comp expense.

It shows you that it doesn't take much for adjusted economic income per share to get back up to closer to $1.00, and can maintain $0.45/share even in a $30 billion AUM and 5% return scenario making the current stock price cheap even under that scenario.

Conclusion
Having said all that, there is still a lot of risk here.  Low returns and low bonuses can easily make it hard for OZM to keep their best people.  But if their best people perform, I assume they do get paid directly for their performance so that shouldn't be too much of an issue.

A lot of the lower returns in recent years is no doubt due to their higher AUM.  But it is also probably due to crowding of the hedge fund world and low interest rates leading to an overall lower return environment for all.

If you think these things are highly cyclical, then you can expect interest rates to normalize at some point.  Money flowing out of hedge funds should also be good for future returns in these strategies.  The part of lower returns at OZM due to higher AUM may not reverse itself, though, if OZM succeeds in maintaining and increasing AUM over time.

But even without the blowout, high returns of the 1990's, OZM can make decent returns over time as seen in the above table.

In any case, unlike a few years ago, the stock prices of many alternative managers are cheap (and I demonstrated how cheap OZM might be here) and institutional money seems to be flowing out of these strategies.

So:
OZM is cheap and is in a seemingly universally hated industry 
Money is flowing out of these strategies, particularly performance chasing institutions (that you would often want to fade)
there is a bear market in active managers and bubble in indexing (which may actually increase opportunities for active managers)
value spreads are wide and has been widening for years making mean reversion overdue
etc.
These things make OZM a compelling play on these various themes. 

I would treat this more like an option, though.  Buy it like you would buy an option, not like you would invest in, say, a Berkshire Hathaway. 

There are a lot of paths here to make good money, but there are also plenty of ways to lose. If you look at this like a binary option, it can be pretty interesting!

Gotham's New Fund
Joel Greenblatt was in Barron's recently.  He is one of my favorite investors so maybe it's a good time for another post. 

Anyway, this new fund is kind of interesting as I am sort of a tinkerer;  this is like the product of some financial tinkering.  I don't know if it's the right product for many, but we'll take a look.

But first, let's see what he has to say about the stock market in general.

The Market
Greenblatt says that the market is ""expensive"".  The market is in the 21st percentile of expensive in the past 25 years. Either a typo or he misspoke, he is quoted as saying that the market has been more expensive 79% of the time in the past 25 years.  Of course, he means the market has been cheaper 79% of the time. 

The year forward expected return from this price level is between 2% to 7%, so he figures it averages out to 4% to 6% per year.  In the past 25 years, the market has returned 9% to 10%/year so he figures the market is 12% to 13% more expensive than it used to be.

He says:
Well, one scenario could be that it drops 12% to 13% tomorrow and future returns would go back to 9% to 10%.  Or you could underearn for three years at 4% to 6%.  We're still expecting positive returns, just more muted. The intelligent strategy is to buy the cheapest things you can find and short the most expensive.  

But...
Immediately, bears will say that this 25 year history is based during a period when interest rates went down.  The 10 year bond rate was around 8% back in 1991, and is now 1.8%.  In terms of valuation, this would have pushed up asset values by 6.2%/year ($1.00 discounted at 8%/year then and $1.00 discounted by 1.8% now).

Declining rates were certainly a factor in stock returns over the past 25 years.  Of course, the stock market didn't keep going up as rates kept going down.  The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500 index at the end of 1990 was around 15x, and now it's 25x according to Shiller's database (raw P/E, not CAPE).   So the valuation gain over the 25 years accounted for around 2%/year of the 9-10% return Greenblatt states.

Here are the EPS estimates for the S&amp;P 500 index according to Goldman Sachs:

          EPS     P/E
2016  $105    20.4x
2017  $116    18.5x
2018  $122    17.6x

Earnings estimates are not all that reliable (estimates have been coming down consistently in the past year or so).  But since most of 2016 is done, I suppose the $105 figure should be OK to use.

I don't know if it's apples to apples (reported versus operating etc.), but if we assume the 'current' P/E of the market is 20x, then the valuation tailwind accounted for 1.2%/year of the 9-10%.  But then of course, even if this was a fair comparison, there is still the aspect of lower interest rates boosting the economy by borrowing future demand (and therefore overstating historical earnings).

In any case, one of the main bearish arguments is that this interest rate tailwind in the past will become a headwind going forward.  Just about everyone agrees with that. 

But as I have mentioned before, calling turns in interest rates is very hard, Japan being a great example.  If you look at interest rates over the past 100 years or more, you see that major turns in trend don't happen all that often; it's been a single trend of declining rates since the 1980/81 peak, basically.  What are the chances that you are going to call the next big turn correctly?  I would bet against anyone trying.  OK, that didn't come out right.  I wouldn't necessarily be long the bond market either.

Gotham Index Plus
So, back to the topic of Gotham's new fund.  It is a fascinating idea. The fund will go long the S&amp;P 500 index, 100% long, and then overlay a 90%/90% long/short portfolio of the S&amp;P 500 stocks based on their valuations.

The built-in leverage alone makes this sort of interesting. Many institutions may have an allocation to the S&amp;P 500 index, and then some allocation to long/short equity hedge funds.  The return of the Gotham Index plus would be much higher (when things go well).

I think this sort of thing was popular at some point in the pension world; index plus alpha etc.  Except I think a lot of those were institutions replacing their S&amp;P 500 index portfolios with futures positions, and then using the cash raised to buy mortgage securities.  Of course, when things turned bad, oops; they took big hits in S&amp;P 500 futures, tried to post cash for the margin call and realized that their mortgage funds weren't liquid  (and was worth a lot less than they thought).

Or something like that.

There is risk here too, of course.  You are overlaying two risk positions on top of each other. When things turn bad, things can certainly get ugly.

I think Greenblatt's calculation is that when things turn bad, the long/short usually does well.  I haven't seen any backtests or anything, so I don't know what the odds of a blowup are.

Expensive stocks tend to be high-beta stocks and cheaper stocks may be lower beta, so in a market correction, the high-beta, expensive names may go down a lot harder.

To some extent, lower valuations may reflect more cyclicality, lower credit risk / lower balance sheet quality too so you have to be a little careful. In a financial crisis-like situation, lower valuation (lower credit quality) can tank and some higher valuation names may hold up (like the FANG-like stocks).

But Greenblatt's screen is not just raw P/E or P/B, but is tied to return on capital, so maybe this is not as much of an issue compared to a pure P/B model.

The argument for this structure is that people can't stay with a strategy if it can't keep up with the market.  Here, the market return is built in from the beginning and you just hope for the ""Plus"" part to kick in. In a long/short portfolio, the beta is netted out to a large extent so can lower potential returns.  This fixes that.  But there is a cost to that.

In any case, I do think it's a really interesting product, but keep in mind that it is a little riskier than Gotham's other offerings.

Oh, and go read the article on why this new fund is a good idea.  Greenblatt is always a great read.

Chipotle (CMG)
Well, Chipotle earnings came out and it was predictably horrible.  The stock is not cheap so it hasn't been recommendable in a while, but I really like the company.  There was a really long article on them recently which was a great read.  It didn't really change my view of them all that much.  I think they will get a lot of business back, eventually.

The earnings call was OK, but what was depressing about it was that they decided to ditch  Shophouse.  I don't think any analysts asked about it so it was a given, I guess.  I had it a couple of times in DC and liked it and was looking forward to it in NY, but I guess that's not going to happen.  As an investor, that was not baked into the cake, I don't think, even though there was probably some hope that the CMG brand can be extended into other categories.

This puts a lot of doubt into that idea.  Someone said that brand extensions in restaurants/retail never work, and that has proven to be the case here.  I wouldn't get too excited about pizza and burgers either.  Burgers are really crowded now and will only get more so.

If CMG has to look to Europe for growth, that is not so great either as the record of U.S. companies expanding into Europe is not good.  I would not count on Europe growth.

Anyway, this doesn't mean it's all over for CMG. I think they will come back, but there are some serious headwinds now other than their food poisoning problem; more competition etc.  They were the only game in town for a while, but now everyone seemingly wants to become the next Chipotle, so there are a lot of options out there now. 

As for Ackman's interest in CMG, I have no idea what his plan is.  There is no real estate here as CMG rents all their restaurants, and their restaurants had high 20's operating margins at their peak.  I don't know if they will ever get back up there, but it's not like these guys don't know how to run an efficient operation.  Maybe Ackman sees SGA opportunities, but pre-crisis, SGA was less than 7%, so there wouldn't be that much of a boost from cutting SGA. Or maybe he thinks it's time for CMG to do what everyone else is doing and go for the franchise model.  Who knows?  I look forward to seeing what his thoughts are; hopefully some 500 page presentation pops up somewhere...

McDonalds
I don't want to turn this into a food blog, but I can't resist mentioning this.  I have been a lifelong MCD customer; I have no problem with it.  OK, it may not be my first choice of a meal in most cases, but it's fine.  And when you have a kid, you tend to go more often that you'd like.  But still, it's OK. It is what it is, right?

I like the remodelling that they are doing, and the fact that they have free wifi is great too.
But here's a big clustermuck they had with their recent custom burger and kiosk idea.  I walked into a MCD without knowing anything about any of this recently.  A lady said I can order at the kiosk and I said, no, I'll just go to the counter, thank you.

And I waited 10 minutes or so in line, looking up at the tasty looking special hamburgers on the HD, LCD menu board.  It was finally my turn at the cash register and I said I want that tasty looking hamburger up there on the screen.  And the lady said, oh, you can only order that at the kiosk. I was like, huh?  That was really annoying.  So I wait all this time and I can't get what I want; I have to walk all the way back and get in another line again? Come on!  At that point, I didn't want any other burger so I just ordered a salad (and the usual for my kid).

OK, so it's my fault, probably.  User error.  But as a service company, as far as I'm concerned, that was a massive fail on the part of MCD.

OK, Now That I started... 
And by the way, since I got myself started, let me get these two out too.  Yes, I spend too much time at fast food joints.  Guilty.  But still, here are my two peeves related to two of my favorite fast casual places: 

Shake Shack:   Being dragged there all the time, I have learned to love the Shack-cago hot dog. Chicken Shack is awesome too, in case you don't want to eat hamburgers all the time. But I can't tell you how often they get take-out and stay wrong.  I had a long run where they didn't get it right at all and had to ask for things to be packed to go.  It is really annoying and wastes everyone's time. 

Chipotle:  This hasn't happened to me the last couple of times, but this is the usual conversation that happens to me just about every time I go to Chipotle.

CMG: ""Hi, what can we get you today?"" (or some such)
Me: ""Um, I'll have a burrito...""
CMG: putting the tortilla in the tortilla warmer/cooker, ""and would you like white rice or brown rice?
Me: ""White rice is fine""
CMG: with tortilla still in the cooker, ""and black beans or pinto beans?""
Me: ""black beans"".
CMG: laying a sheet of aluminum foil on the counter and placing the tortilla on it, moving over to the rice area, ""Was that white rice or brown rice?""
Me: ""white rice""
CMG: sliding over to the beans, ""and black beans or pinto beans?"".
Me: ""black"".

I can't tell you how many times this exact thing happened to me.  If you can't remember what I say, don't ask beforehand!  Just ask when we get to whatever you are going to ask me about!  This is not rocket science, lol...  Incredibly annoying.

Anyway, I still love CMG and will keep eating there.

Oh, and to make things interesting, I decided to post a contact email address in the ""about"" section of the blog.  I will try to respond to every email, but keep in mind I may not look in that email box all the time. 

I will try to post more, though.

At some point things got out of control and she began playing a bit of a shell game. In the hopes that I wouldn't notice. I don't blame her, it got overwhelming and she panicked and I wasn't active enough in our finances.

That said, I now find my family in an overwhelming amount of debt. I've managed to get the house refinanced and freed up some capital to pay things down. Additionally I have some money that I recently inherited that will pay down 3/4 of the debt.

My question for you is whether it makes strategic sense to take the inheritance money and pay down the highest interest rate balances or if I should look for a equity line of credit to dump all the debt in to and then pay out over time.

I believe it makes more sense to pay down the debt and deal with the tax implications of the inheritance (a life insurance policy) later by instituting a strict budget and saving towards the bill. But there's a lingering thought that maybe I should invest the inheritance and hope the interest will pay down the debt over time.

I'm qualified for FAFSA, so I receive about $1,000+ a month. I have about $10k sitting in a CD and about $5k sitting in my checking.

2) I don't really spend much money but if I do, it's either towards shopping or food, and why leave money in a checking account when I can be earning interest from that.

I did a balance transfer through Chase of about $1000 + transfer fee and have been paying the monthly charge of $25. I received an email from Wells Fargo with another opportunity to transfer my balance and the following:


*For a limited time, transfer a balance to your Wells Fargo Credit Card ending in [Last 4] and pay 4.9% APR for 15 months. After that, the standard variable 15.40% APR for balance transfers will apply as of 10/27/2016. This APR varies with the market based on U.S. Prime Rate. The fee for the balance transfer will be 4% ($5 minimum). For future balance transfers, the fee will be up to 5%, with a minimum of $5.*

I graduated from college back in May with a degree in CE/EE. I took a job in a city/state that I wasn't completely excited in, but it was a good first job and got me some good experience. After around five months, one of the last wave of layoffs hit me. My boss was one of the nicest guys I've met and was genuinely sad when him and his boss pulled me into the office. He said it wasn't performance based at all, and they were satisfied with the work I did. I just have the least amount of time at the company and they are laying off a lot of other people. I was given severance and I also have a couple of questions about the situation in general.

1. The base severance pay I relieved was around 3 grand. There is also an upgraded severance of around 11 grand that I can receive if I fill out a waiver saying basically that I won't sue and what not. It's in addition to the 3 grand. Is this normal? This is my first job so I have never really experienced this. I am planning on signing it.

2. Thanks to r/PF, I have a decent emergency fund. Being in a city I'm not too excited about, I plan to cancel my lease which will cost around 2 grand and won't affect my credit. What next steps should I take? 

Some more general info.

I have loans that start payments next month. I'm pretty sure I can substantially reduce the payments given they are federal loans. Is this my best option? 

I also have a car payment of around $350 that I am planning on keeping. I'm thinking I can last a while with what I'm given. Any advice in general? My other living expenses will be minimal considering I plan on moving back home and start job searching ASAP. This is my first time ever experiencing this so I am just looking for some advice as someone pretty much fresh out of college. Thanks for any advice!",finance,1478822728
personalfinance,"Recently 26, struggling to make those $1000/mo student loans","Hi there, Reddit. I'm embarrassed to say I was barely making ends meet before I turned 26, but my loans through Sallie Mae seem to have just doubled.

I don't know how much longer my car will hold out and my parents cosigned the loan, but just recently retired. I'm currently living rent-free plus utilities with a fellow filmmaker in exchange for working on some of their shittier gigs in their stead, and I get to keep what I make on those. 

What else should I tell you? What can I do? Help~",finance,1478824860
personalfinance,Prioritizing Roth IRA over debt. Am I doing this wrong? [Long],"I'm a student with $98,000 of federal student loans @ 6.2%, who will graduate in about 18 months. At that point, I anticipate getting a job in healthcare and being able to save about $20,000/year. I just received an assistantship position that will cover tuition and living expenses for the rest of my schooling, with an $11,000 stipend. I already have emergency savings. I also have $31,000 in an index fund in a Roth IRA from a previous career.  

Looking at the flowchart in the FAQ, I feel like the Reddit Personal Finance consensus is to avalanche any debt above 5% before investing in a Roth. However, since I can only put $5,500 into my Roth every year, I feel like I'd be wasting those eligible contributions, and thus missing out on compounding interest in the long term. So here's my math. It assumes a 6% average annual return on the index. It also assumes I continue to save $20,000/year after my debt is paid.  

Option 1: Pay my $11k stipend and $31k Roth into my debt.   
Year 0: Debt: $57,000, Roth: $0  
Year 1.5: Debt: $62,301, Roth: $0 (New job acquired--savings begin)  
Year 4.5: Debt: $0 Roth: $0  
Year 10: Roth: $40,666, Non-Roth eligible savings: $49,500  
Year 20: $149,671, Non-Roth eligible savings: $194,500  
  
Option 2: Put $11,000 toward debt, don’t touch Roth  
Year 0: Debt: $87,000, Roth $31,000  
Year 1.5: Debt: $95,091, Roth $34,832 (New job acquired--savings begin)  
Year 7: Debt $0, Roth: $52,374  
Year 10: Roth: $80,939, non-Roth eligible savings $43,500  
Year 20: Roth $221,793, non-Roth eligible savings $188,500  
  
Option 3: Put $11,000 into Roth over two years, avalanche when new job is acquired.  
Year 0: Debt: $98,000, Roth $36,500  
Year 1.5: Debt $107,114, Roth : $44,520 (New job acquired--savings begin)  
Year 8: Debt $0 Roth: $70,958  
Year 10: Roth: $91,738, Non-Roth savings: $29,000  
Year 20: $241,133, Non-Roth Savings: $174,000  

Option 4: Max Roth every year, put leftover savings towards debt  
Year 0: Debt: $98,000, Roth $36,500  
Year 1.5: Debt $107,114 Roth: $44,520 (New job acquired--savings begin)  
Year 10.5: Debt $0, Roth: $142,210  
Year 20: Roth $331,520 Non-Roth Savings: $137,750  
  
So, I feel like the math confirms my suspicions: I will make the most money over time if I max my Roth as many years as possible and make smaller contributions towards my loans. Of course, this assumes a 6% average return on the index fund, that I will graduate school successfully, that I will get a job immediately, and that I will be hold the job and save $20,000 every year. 

Please let me know what you think. Did I grossly oversimplify my future financial picture (ignoring home ownership, potential 401k savings)? Is my math just plain wrong? Are any of my assumptions unrealistic? Is there another factor I haven't considered? Or did I convince you that I should prioritize my Roth over the avalanche method? 

EDIT: formatting",finance,1478828215
personalfinance,Future home buying strategy,"Hello, PF, I come to you with a rather specific question about how to go about this project of mine.

Right now I'm going through a career switch (to a much better, higher paying career), that most likely involves a move to California. I'm thinking of staying there for about 5 years, saving up, and then moving to Hawaii and hopefully buying a house after a year or so. This would be a one-time purchase that I intend to eventually pay off in full, so things like interest rates matter a lot. I've already bought a sold a home in the past, so I'm well aware of the pain involved with home ownership.

So, 5 years from now the median house price in one of the areas we want will probably be somewhere around 700-800k. With a 20% conventional loan, that's a 140-160k downpayment with at least another 10k in fees, so I'd need to save up about 170k. Luckily I've mapped out a budget where I comfortably can get there through saving a little disposable income (my retirement is well-funded), but I'd also need about a 3-4% rate of return to get there in that timeframe.

The thing is, I don't want that money just sitting around in savings getting some paltry return rate, so I'm trying to think of a vehicle to put that in. I'm thinking a Vanguard California muni fund might do the trick since it gets a pretty stable 3-4% return rate without a terrible amount of risk, and I won't have to pay any taxes when it comes time to withdraw a truckload of money for this down payment all at once. This is option A.

Option B is to get a VA loan (I'm leaving the military soon) and pay 0% down, and rather apply whatever I have to the principal, whenever I want. That means I don't have to pony up a bunch of cash all at once, but can do it on a timeline of my choosing. Most likely I'll have the same interest rate as I would with option A. In either case, I also plan on contributing extra payments each month to get the whole thing paid off before I go into early retirement.

So, I guess I have 2 questions: 

1) Should I keep my savings in California munis during my time as a CA resident, or is there a more sensible vehicle for a 5-year investment time horizon? I can't tell if I'm being needlessly risky or appropriately cautious.

2) Does it make more sense to get the 20% down conventional loan or the 0% down (~10k in fees) VA loan?

Any help is appreciated! Thanks!",finance,1478829850
personalfinance,What should I do with my remaining student loan balance?,"I have $18,138 remaining split into four federal loans all at 6.55% with auto pay.

However, Earnest is offering a refinance rate of 5.18% fixed or 4.17% variable for a five year loan where I can comfortably make the minimum payment and also make additional payments.

ethereum,"The Dai stablecoin, MakerDAO and Islamic finance","Banking according to Sharia (Islamic law) prohibits specific interest or fees for loans of money. How does this match up with the upcoming economic ecosystem centered around the Dai stablecoin?
Application of Sharia principles to banking prevents specific interest rates and so instead relies on a range of alternative approaches such as reselling and rent-charging in order to service customers while maintaining adherence to religious doctrine. Similarly, saving accounts do not yield interest but instead can receive beneficiary gifts (*Hibah*).

Naturally, the Dai stablecoin is available for this segment of humanity as well.

**Holding Dai**: just holding Dai does not earn interest (*Riba*) so the most obvious obstacle to use is not present. Additionally, as the Dai value over time can move from the SDR peg, which can be considered an Islamic gift (*Hibah*). This is clearly the case as the movement of Dai value is subject to the MakerDAO governance (out of control of a single individual) and is not time bound (MakerDAO governance decides). Additionally there is not in any shape or form a guarantee involved in the movement of Dai valuation. Holding the Dai stablecoin can therefore be said to fully conform with the principles of Islamic banking.

**Borrowing Dai**: creating Dai by moving collateral into a collateral debt position (CDP) and getting Dai stablecoins in return is also not in breach of Islamic banking principles, although retrieving the collateral would involve paying the stability fee which would be in direct breach of Sharia banking principles. To get around this the borrower could liquidize the whole CDP position instead of paying the stability fee. Alternatively the whole CDP could be sold to a non-islamic entity.

**Holding MKR**: according to Sharia banking principles, holding the MakerDAO coin MKR is not directly wrong, but certainly highly suspicious. There is no guarantee of payment, no ensured interest, but the highly speculative nature of the MKR coin could easily make holding it a breach of the Sharia principles of speculations (*Gharar*) and the ban on relying on uncertain future events (*Maysir*). Devout followers of Sharia banking may want additional religious guidance before deciding to hold MKR.  

I challenge all Islamic scholars to read up on MakerDAOs whitepaper and confirm or discuss the assumptions above.

This article will in a modified form be published on Sharia banking forums for crossfertilization of ideas.

personalfinance,Do installment credit cards help build credit?,"Hey guys,

I came across this last night when it popped up on my facebook feed. Seems like a credit card that turns your purchase into an installment loan up to 24 months. 

Can this help build credit faster than just using a regular credit card, carrying a balance and paying off incrementally? They post their interest rates on the site (paikon.com) which is around 14% and seem to much better than what I currently get from my bank, which is over 20%.",finance,1478880468
personalfinance,I Paid Off $30k in Student Loans in 20 Months.,"We refinanced my wife's student loans to a 5 year term with SoFi.  It was $580 a month at a far better interest rate than what Navient gave us.  It was paid off in 20 months with a series of windfalls (refinance escrow refund and cashing in our whole life when we traded it for a term), quarterly bonuses, and overpaying a bit each month.

That's not to say that we had complications; we're a single person income family; my wife underwent three surgeries in the same time; we needed to buy a (used) van to replace her '95 Saturn.  Life happens.

Now our only debt is our recently refinanced mortgage (15-year at 3.25%), and my $10k student loans at 3.88%.

I figure it's time to treat ourselves, and I don't care what PF says.  With the extra money each month, we're going to do something absolutely insane and split it evenly between our IRAs to catch up...

I was a complete noob when starting this and used tap water(not from a well) which I believe is chlorinated by my city. I also had no PH meter and no other meters or PH adjusters. About 4 days in one of the plants died and I think it was because I damaged too much of the roots when I transplanted it. I also think I planted most of them too shallow with not enough support from the clay rocks and I think that might be why they're droopy.

Around 8 days in I also recieved my PH kit so I could keep the PH around 6 which I think helped immensely. I also haven't changed the water at all yet and I don't think I'm going to because I don't see much if any algae growth and it's in a 15 gallon container.

Obviously the plants don't look as good as they probably should. A couple have kind of long arms and one is opened very wide(because of it being directly under the light?). Also another thing is that I used the 3 part general hydroponic solution, except I didn't use floramicro or bloom because I didn't even know they existed lol. They are most likely under fed. I know i'm definitely being a lot more precise next run and I'm going to be using RO/Distilled water from walmart.

personalfinance,"Low credit score with no current open credit account, looking for advice on opening a new credit account to improve credit usage for credit score.","Hello Reddit!

I have a very low credit score - approx. 500 currently (due to a previous relationship with an abusive partner who was in control of the majority of my finances and being a young college graduate). I have finally reached a point where I am not scraping paycheck to paycheck and have full control and have begun paying off my credit card regularly for the last few months, and have raised my credit score by about 30 points so far in the last several months.

My credit card has $3885 left to pay off, and I am paying off $300/month to finish paying completely in 1 year. The account is closed due to the long overdue balanced held and the fact that I couldn't meet the minimum monthly payment for a quite a while. This is the only credit card I have (I opened it about 6 years ago), and the only other loan I have is a student loan of $5,450 which I am paying off slowly at the moment ($42/month with minimum payment of $36) until I finish paying off my closed credit card, at which point I will increase payment to the student loan.

My question there is - do I get another credit card to begin rebuilding my credit score even more? I have only ever had the one account and from what I've read it seems like I should, I am just worried that my current low score would create a problem with me getting approved and/or make it so that I had a high interest rate (not that I plan on carrying a balance on the new card anyway, but I'd like to ideally invest in a card I can have for a long time and use for future large purchases and of course I'd like a lower interest rate). While I think my current budgeting skills are quite decent, I am less comfortable in this area with my own knowledge and would appreciate some educated input and advice from you folks. If a new credit card is indeed the right move, are there any particular ones you would recommend?

I am located in California if that matters at all. Please let me know what information I may be missing here that you would need to make a recommendation.

personalfinance,"University back charged for Federal Aid, no fault of my own (long story, please read). Really need some advice.","So this is kind of long to explain so bear with me, I’ll try to keep it short.

I’m 21 and a now a senior finishing my 4 year bachelor’s degree at university. I completed my AA at a state college and transferred to the university last year. I’ve done a FAFSA application every year and always received the maximum approx. $5700 of aid per year.  At my university now the $5700 doesn’t cover everything so I took small federal subsidized loans of only what I needed (ended up being about $1500 per semester for last year). Last year when I started the 2015 fall semester I was awarded the FAFSA and loan and went about the semester like normal. 


My dad owns a small business and was given an extension on his taxes which I turned into the university as requested. A few months down the line when my dad turned my taxes in to the university, it turned out that it has not been accepted by the IRS because he didn’t file the new 1095 Healthcare form. No big deal, he started taking care of that and then the IRS decided to audit him because he attached his social security number to his business rather than getting an EIN (not smart I know). Well, through auditing they found out that some corporate paperwork that gets filed every year was not filed for 2 years. My dad said he had been paying a company to file it for those years.. I guess they took the money and didn’t do anything, and now they’re out of business. So my dad hired an accountant to help and go through the process of proving everything was legitimate with the business and that the business’ income was not his personal income. I was told this wouldn’t take long and that I’d be able to turn his taxes in to the university and everything would be fine. 


This turned into months… And the university back charged me for the financial aid I received for the fall 2015 semester. Under the assumption that everything would be resolved quickly, I enrolled for the spring 2016 semester and got a payment plan since my dad basically told me I was on my own paying for this semester until everything got resolved. Then, mid spring 2016 semester he told me that things would be resolved by March and I didn’t really need to pay the fees since the university would receive the money I was awarded before everything was due. (I was working for Wells Fargo part time and maintaining my first job as well, not making good money and trying to supporting myself, my fiance, and his mom due to a surgery). Multiple times I tried to talk to the financial aid office at the university and ask if there was a way my dad’s accountant could talk to them and provide proof of what was going on or if there was anything they could do for me at all… They didn’t care and didn’t help, provide any suggestions, or anything. Now it’s literally been a year and I’m still waiting for things to be resolved. 


I owe the university $3600 for fall 2015 and spring 2016 and now the account has gone delinquent and been sent to collections, as well as hit my credit score (which I just started building this year as I finally got my first credit card). My federal student loans are now going to be due as of December since I've been out of school for more than 6 months. Once everything is fixed.. My dad’s tried to reassure me that the claim against me has to be retracted and no longer affect my credit score but I don’t even know if that’s true.


I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if there’s anything I can do. I’m completely at the mercy of the IRS thanks to the federal law that FAFSA applications must supply your parents’ tax information until you’re 24. I’ve applied for scholarships every year I’ve gone to school and have never received anything… I maintain a 3.2-3.3 GPA, I’m in Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society and been invited to enroll in Honors programs and other Honors Societies, I’ve had a job since I was 16 years old and in August I just became employed at a good paying full-time job. I’m 11 classes away from graduating with my bachelor’s in Management Information Systems.. I was supposed to be graduating this Spring 2017 semester and it’s depressing the hell out of me. I don’t have enough credit history to get a private loan and there’s no way my dad would co-sign with me. I don’t know what to do.

I found a job in the city they live in and they're happy to have me home ""until I get married."" I've had family friends give me advice with what to do with my extra money and I'd like some more advice from Reddit.

Some background: 

 - I have about $40k in federal loans. Most around 4.5% (range is 3.2%-6.8%) I have no other debt.
- My salary is $40k a year (in FL) before taxes.
- I am not eligible for a 401k at my company until I've been there a year (it's been 3 months so far).
- I do not own a car, but I drive a car my father owns outright.
- My expenses are around only $500 a month on average. However, my father owns his own business so I occasionally have to make $2k-$5k loans to his business. He repays me with 5% interest usually within a month or two and he's always been reliable at paying me back.
- I have about $20k in the bank.
- I have a decent amount of credit for a guy in his early twenties with a score of around 750.

So my main question is what do I do with this money? Right now it's just sitting in my savings account.  I've had people suggest real estate and then renting out the property, investing in the stock market, and paying off my loans immediately.

Donald Trump! Recently elected president of the united states of america and a former TV star (not unlike the ""govenator"" but that is completely unrelated), trump is (or was?) the CEO of his own company (idk what it is/was called) which means trump, himself, is easily worth millions (billions?) and knows his way around the mega-corporate society. His position as CEO prior to running for president leads me to believe he will have a ""rich get richer"" modus operandi (method of operation or in short, MO) as president and will no doubt draw an even larger gap between the 1% and the rest of us peons as the average Joe may be seen in his societal circle. Nothing good can come from a businessman turned politician seeing as how business men are about taking from consumers while giving less in return and politicians are all about that pokerface but now that the 1% has been mentioned, let's change the subject.

Who are the 1%? The 1% are the people in possession of something like 90% of the world's valuable currency whether it be the almighty dollar or some foreign currency stashed away in a swiss bank account, never to see the light of day. Some would say the 1% rule the world and I say the 1% are known as the Bilderberg Group (at least, in part) and as far as I am concerned, they actually rule the world. Every year this group of ladies and gentlemen meet at the Bilderberg Summit and from what I can gather, decide on where to herd us sheeple and through what means. Big names like Gates, and Jobs have appeared on the guest list as well as names that will never be known to the public due to the fact that multi-billionaires live in a different society then anyone who will read this post. Needless to say, the Bilderberg Group have enough funds to orchestrate a coup if they so desired but in my opinion, they would rather subvert the world through subtlety and lies, quietly swaying public opinion in their favor to bring about their vision for a perfect world (perfect for them?). I mean, why destroy a nation or world order they helped build when it can quietly be taken over? These men and women are rich, not stupid and their plans are starting to break the horizon, casting rays of sunshine across a landscape they shall soon claim as their own. 

The Bilderberg Group? Donald Trump? What does it all mean? Well I'll tell ya what it means to me! Donald trump was selected by the Bilderberg Group to bring about their plans through executive order. The fact that Trump had been in public media as a leader during the show ""The Apprentice"" was a good start in narrowing down who, within the Bilderberg Group, to push for president and now that Trump has been elected, the choice was obviously well made.

 The president has power to make changes any other politician can't and Donald Trump has already stated his plans as president, most notably that he will rescind every executive order pushed through by Barack Obama but that is small potatoes to me. The meat of what Trump plans to do is reduce the terms of just about every politician and that means we'll have to elect new people to fill their roles sooner. This might not seem like anything major at first but with the the idea that the Bilderberg Group is the hand behind the puppet, it begins to carry a little more weight. I believe Donald Trump is acting as president with a mega-corporate backing instead of an ""of the people for the people, by the people"" backing and intends to fill the vacant positions with representatives of the Mega-corporations instead of representatives of the people.

The face of the united states is poised to change from a representative democracy to an economic oligarchy. With the Mega-corporations fielding representatives into office, the only thing that can happen is a dispersion of power from the capitol to the mega corporate headquarters and the change has already begun. Trump stated in his plans that he is going to remove a federal sanction on newly established cities and this, to me, means that he is opening the floodgates to a new landgrab on a corporate level. I expect Google, Microsoft, Sony, Apple, Yahoo and any other major corporation to begin funding development of new cities in rural locations to serve as their seats of power once the Bilderberg Group's plans progress to the point that power has shifted. 

This may not be a bad thing but it doesn't look like a good thing either, if anyone wants to see a corporate run future, there is a TV show called Continuum (a sci-fi original series) that paints an ugly picture of privatized national security and trans-corporate conflict as well as terror attacks being orchestrated in revolt of corporate control. The biggest issue with a economic oligarchy is the idea that there will be multiple leaders all fighting for control over their territory. It is one concept to move power away from the people but but a whole other ball park trying to get the people in power to cooperate once they are in power. I expect the united states to be split into corporate districts that start as cities then progress to full fledged states and then eventually independent nations all fighting over territory across the continental U.S.. 

The balance of power is going to change, my question is when and at the cost of how many lives? Remember that these people are the ones who fuel your internet searches and bring you recipes over the internet. The same people who keep you entertained with things like XBOX and PlayStation. The people who keep your daily life going could possibly turn into your worst enemy when you buy the wrong product or advertise the wrong brand. Scary stuff, the future is.

In my belief, the Bilderberg Group hired ex-intelligence agents (CIA, NSA etc.) to develop mind programming techniques to sell their products and brands in order to dominate every market and this is where videogames come in. I believe the two biggest, most controversial, videogame releases in recent years (destiny and NMS) were developed by the Bilderberg Group to test their ability to manipulate a market using mind programming techniques and gauge how well they could elevate a company (bungie and HelloGames) into their fold though such manipulation.",technology,1478911156

personalfinance,Need advice for mom's future plans. $10k CC debt and $20k in savings,"Hello /r/personalfinance

To give you a little background:
So my mom (56) currently has $10k in credit card debt, with a credit score of around 650.
Here's her current balance for each credit card along with the interest rates:

* Discover Cashback: $3,300. 0% interest until 4/17
* American Express: $2500. 0% interest until 2/17
* Commerce Bank: $1,200 15% interest
* Sam's Club: $3000 25% interest

She currently has about $20k in her savings. She works full-time getting $11-$12/hr, along with her 4 boys including me. She barely gets by every month after paying all the bills, which leaves her either more in debt in CC's or saving maybe $100-$200 per month.

I decided that before I move to Boston for my full-time job (recent graduate), I'm trying to help her as much as I can so that she has a plan.

So here's her plan:
Pay off the minimum balance, or even a bit more, and save more money and hopefully let her savings account increase by $1k semi-annually ($2k/year). With her savings account being $20k+, she wants to start her own business so that with that money, she can pay off all her CC debt. That being said, I'm not sure if her credit score will even allow her to pull out a loan, and I know she'll ask me to co-sign or sign the loan since I'm the most responsible child out of my 3 other brothers. (Put's a lot of stress one me). She honestly doesn't even have a business plan either which really stresses me out too because she's not good with the computer. She's just slowly letting her credit score sink and stare at her bank account and feel somewhat pleasure having $20k in her savings, that she doesn't know what to do with.

My plan for her:
Pay off the CC's that have interest. Then pay off at least 15-20% of her CC debt after the discover and american express no-interest perk ends. She'll then have $10k in her savings, with somewhat of a better credit score (hopefully). 

We've always been financially struggling and just made enough to get by. 

I'm looking for advice on her plan, and my plan for her. I'm also looking for any tips on if people have started a small business, how much money did you save up for a down payment for the total cost of the property lease?

personalfinance,"Using HSAs to Invest Money: Questions, Pros/Cons","Hi everyone,

I'm enrolled in an HSA through my health insurance. I'd like to hear your input on my plan and on some questions.

- My HSA requires a minimum balance of $1000 before you can start investing additional money in the account
- There is an interest rate of 0.25% APY. This only applies to the uninvested money in the account, right?
- To invest money, I'd have to pay a $2 monthly fee
- Let's make a basic assumption that invested money would earn a 5% rate of return
- On that assumption, I should make sure that I only start investing once the amount of money I can invest has a 5% return rate that is more than $2? That's to say, $2 is 5% of $40, so I should make sure I start off my investments with more than $40, to ensure the $2 fee isn't more than the interest I'm earning.

Do the details of my HSA seem decent to you all? I'm shopping around, and I found other HSAs that have a better base interest rate (e.g. 0.6% APY), but charge a higher monthly fee on investments. I'm more interested in HSAs that have low investment fees than low base interest APY.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation help,"Hello, I'm a lurker and created an account.

I'm 30 years old and have $29k of credit card debit on 6 cards.  At the beginning of the year I decided to stop the credit card spending cold turkey.  Everything has been good for the whole year but I'm looking how to save myself in interest payments.  I've cut up the cards and have not used them for 11 months.  I currently have been using the Snowball method and it actually got rid of 2 of my other cards earlier in the year.  Here are the current cards:

Southwest: $8,258 - APR:14.49%
Discover Wife: $6,570 - APR:20.24%
Freedom: $6,564 - APR:13.49%
Discover Husband: $2,926 - APR:23.24%
Paypal Credit: $2,824 - APR:19.99%
MasterCard: $1,757 - APR:13.49%

Using the snowball method, I've been putting $1k towards credit cards every month.  So right now, the majority goes to the MasterCard payment.  I believe this is around $320 over minimum payments right now.

My FICO score is 746.  The combined income of my wife and I is around 110k.  I've been thinking about doing a Discover Personal Loan to get a lower interest rate and one monthly payment. If they come in high on the APR, then I was going to check local Credit Unions.  Honestly, I'm wondering if I would qualify for an unsecured loan for ~$30k???

I can list all my monthly expenses if you guys want me to, but putting $1k a month on credit cards is from cutting all the fat off the budget.  So really if I can get an unsecured personal loan under that then I would assume it would work to my advantage.

Let me know if you have any questions, but I look forward to hearing your responses.

financialindependence,Tips and Tricks for your FIRE Spreadsheets,"### Intro

Many people on this sub swear by keeping a spreadsheet of their financial history rather than relying solely on outside trackers such as Mint, Personal Finance, or YNAB. I am solidly in that camp, since I feel the process of making my own spreadsheets gave me strong insight into how all the gears of my personal finances mesh together. But there's definitely a learning curve.

This post is to present 3 tips and tricks that you may find useful when putting together your own spreadsheets that are specifically relevant to the pursuit of FIRE. They all work in both Excel and Google Docs. 

I've created a companion Google Docs spreadsheet with implementations and descriptions of all of these for you to follow along: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_rNLXoZx06P2RJRwsO9RDeXKfxAV_ZdbJRpoCGkL6kQ/edit?usp=sharing

Let's get started!

----

###1) How to Find Monthly Interest From Yearly Interest

This is a mistake I see over and over again. If your yearly interest is 10%, your monthly interest is just 10%/12 = 0.83%, right? Wrong.^*

This arises from forgetting that interest is compounding, and builds upon itself exponentially. Let's look at it in reverse. Here is the well-known compounding interest formula:

    'Yearly Interest Rate' = (1 + 'Monthly Interest Rate)^12 - 1

Once that makes sense, going from yearly interest to monthly interest is the exact same formula shifted around. In the end, you get your monthly interest rate as: 

    'Monthly Interest Rate' = (1 + 'Yearly Interest Rate')^(1/12) - 1

If your yearly interest rate is 10%, the monthly comes out to 0.80%, which is roughly a 0.04% difference. Now this doesn't seem like much, but if you're projecting growth out 10 years then the difference at the end of those 10 years can be huge. Check out the spreadsheet to see how this plays out ([pic](http://imgur.com/U7wxb9k.png)).

\* As /u/shinypenny01 pointed out [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5cmanl/tips_and_tricks_for_your_fire_spreadsheets/d9xvoms/), this doesn't apply to APR. For that you would simply divide the annual rate by 12 to get the monthly rate (if interest accumulates monthly).

----

###2) How to Find the Time to Hit Your FI Number

Assume you have $100,000 sitting in an investment account. You want to know when it will hit a target balance such as your FI Number. For this example let's say you want to reach $1 million. Let's also assume the investment returns 7% each year after inflation. How long will it take for that investment to reach the target balance?

**Case 1:** You're not going to touch the investment at all and will let it ""coast"".

Since this is simple exponential growth, you can start with the formula for compound growth:

    'FI Number' = 'Initial Net Worth' * (1 + 'Yearly Rate') ^ 'Years to FI'

By doing some algebra to solve for time, you end up with the formula:

    'Years to FI' = LOG('FI Number' / 'Initial Net Worth') / LOG(1 + 'Yearly Growth Rate')

In this example, you'll see that it will take 34.0 years to coast to FI.

**Case 2:** You are in the accumulation phase of the FI path and are adding money to the investment every year.

The above approach won't work here because there is a jump in value of the investment each year when you add money. Luckily, there is a built in function NPER() which will solve this for us. NPER() stands for Number of Periodic Payments, and was designed to calculate time to pay off a loan that is accumulating interest. Thankfully, with a few tweaks to the inputs it works just as well for calculating time for an appreciating asset to hit a target value under periodic contributions. The way to use this function to find the time to hit a FI Number is like this:

    'Years to FI' = 'NPER('Yearly Growth Rate', -'Yearly Contribution', -'Current Net Worth', 'FI Number')

Note the negative signs in the function. This will also work for Case 1 by setting the yearly contribution to 0.

If you are contributing $30,000/yr, you can see that in this scenario it will take 14.7 years to hit FI. See how both these cases work in the spreadsheet ([pic](http://imgur.com/oWq4xNo.png)). You can scroll down to check that the years to FI are calculated correctly.

----

###3) How to Find the Average Market Return for Your Investment

Say you have $100,000 sitting in an investment account at the beginning of the year, and you contribute $2,000 to it each month. The market will fluctuate, and since your investments won't exactly track any one market index, you want to know what it has been returning for you. There are two ways to do this.

**Option 1:**

You can calculate the change in the investment balance each month, and subtract out your contribution to find the change due to market movement over that month. From there you can simply divide the monthly starting balance by the market movement to find the monthly return. The annualized return for that month is then (1+'Monthly Return')12 - 1. This approach is more 'human readable'.

To find the average return, you need to take the geometric mean (not the mean!) of these returns. GEOMEAN() does not work for negative numbers, so you need to add and subtract a 1 to the returns for this to work. And in order to add a 1 to a range of numbers, you need to make this an array formula. In Google Sheets this is:

    'Average Return' = ARRAYFORMULA(GEOMEAN(1 + 'Range of Returns') - 1)

In Excel, array formulas are entered differently. Type in the following formula and press ctrl-shift-enter:

    GEOMEAN(1 + 'Range of Returns') - 1

**Option 2:** 

The function XIRR() (Irregular Internal Rate of Return) is built specifically for this. It does however requires a column with some varying formulas. See the rightmost column in the linked spreadsheet for how to set this up, since it's hard to communicate in prose ([pic](http://imgur.com/nigHfSX.png)). Once you do, the formula is simple:

    'Average Return' = XIRR('XIRR Column', 'Date Range')

These two options won't give identical results, though they are very close. XIRR() is more accurate since it doesn't assume each month is exactly 1/12th of the year. You can refresh the spreadsheet to regenerate the random market returns and see the differences.

1) I need to pay off $4500 in credit card debt. I know this is bad. I was unable to get student loans by myself, and my parents were unwilling to cosign, so I was forced to put all my school expenses for the last few semesters on my credit card. I'm now dumping all my extra income, about $300 monthly toward that and expecting about $1000 in taxes back, which will also go toward the debt. 

2) I want to attend school. I'm now at the point where I want to transfer to a better school, so I'm living in a cheaper state and working while I apply to schools. Any extra money I have I want to save for school, but I figured paying off the cc with a high interest rate is most important. The good news is that I can keep my job while in school since I work remotely and make pretty good money for only having to work ~20 hours a week. 

3) My dad is retiring, so I'm getting taken off his swanky health insurance. At this point it seems like healthcare.gov is my best option with a plan that costs about $200/month with a $2k deductible. Does this sound like a decent option, or do you guys have a better recommendation? I tend to get sick a lot and I need a prescription for acne medication, so I'm afraid to go totally without insurance. 

Anyway, I feel like I'm doing ok despite the setbacks, but I was hoping you guys might have some sage advice for me. Thanks!",finance,1478987279
personalfinance,What to do with HSA from previous job?,"Hi,

I recently switched jobs and have a HSA account from my old job. I am not able to contribute anymore to it. It has over $2000. What should I do with it?

1) Should I just leave it there? Since it is over $1000 I am not getting charged any monthly fees. The interest rate is 0.4%. 

2) Should I use it now on any health expenses? 

3) Should I invest it? I do have the option to invest the money that is in my HSA. I believe there is a $2.90 monthly fee for the investment option. Below are the investment options that are available. Is it worth it to invest it?

personalfinance,I messed up with my first car.,"Hi guys. Before I start I will preface with how much of an idiot I am. Any advice is helpful..

I am 19, and last year I bought a car. I only had $600 down, no credit, no cosigner. I was desperate for a car. It was an awful decision. I financed a car for $12,000 at a 16.99% interest rate. I now pay $340 a month. I am able to afford the huge monthly payment. But the big issue is that my car is not worth more than $4,000-5,000 at the most. It's a newer car but has a lot of miles. I owe $8,600 on it. 

My question is, how should I try to fix my huge mistake?
 I have a decent credit score now, so I am thinking of refinancing through my bank. But my issue is I am still paying 3x as much as it's worth. Do I deal with my mistake, try to refinance, or get a different car completely? Sell it? I don't have any money saved up, but I could start. 

Thank you guys.

personalfinance,"Should I use the money I have saved up ($3800) to pay off my current loan ($3700), leaving me almost no savings?","Here is my situation: I am 22 y.o. I took out a federal unsubsidized loan about two years ago for $3250, the current balance is about $3770. In January I will be entering an associate’s nursing program that will be 2 years long, and I plan to pursue a bachelors degree immediately after (costs about $25k total). This will be away from home so I won't be living with my parents. As of January 2017 it will be about 2 years until I am able to get a professional salary and 4 years until I will be completely done with school expenses. 

My family income situation is itself rather complicated. My parents supported me through community college while I was living away from home (3 years) and were making 100k+, but my dad lost his job roughly a year ago in October 2015. I have been living with then since June 2015. They make very little now but this change of income has not made a difference on my FAFSA and will not for at least another academic year due to FAFSA’s new rule that FAFSA will be using 2015 income data 2 years in a row (lucky me). I do not expect to get any FAFSA grants due to this. Therefore no matter what I will essentially be surviving on loans until I graduate the nursing program in 2019. I am told the program is very rigorous and I will not able to work much while succeeding academically. 

My question: should I pay off my current loan now with what little I have saved up, leaving me almost no savings? (I have about $2k to my name other than than and my parents cannot help me financially)
 If I pay off this small loan now with my meager savings will it save me money in the long wrong due to accruing interest? It will be years until I am done with school and I’m worried this small loan may end up costing me far too much if I don’t get rid of it now.

personalfinance,House down payment question,"Obviously the more you put down, the less your payments will be and the less interest you will pay. I know that this is kind of counter balanced a bit by you being able to deduct the interest you pay on your loan from your income. Also by being able to make money on that money while you still have it.

Lets say you had 500k saved up, you could just outright buy a 250k house.  Ignoring the improvement on your credit you would get by taking out a loan, would it be better to pay for it outright or would it be better to make a big down payment and then take out a loan for the reset or just do the standard 20 percent? I understand that this could also depend on the interest rate you get charged for the loan.  Lets assume today's standard and I'm curious at what percentage would it start being even more advantageous to pay more down?

I guess I'm wondering what will cost you the least in the long run? To be even more specific, lets say you are investing your money into the S&amp;P 500 to attempt to make money off your money.

Also, I understand there is not a definitive answer here because obviously the S&amp;P 500 could lose a lot or gain a lot changing the answer but I meant more on average.",finance,1479002990

ethereum,Is Rootstock a threat to Ethereum?,"Just some thoughts, let me know what you think.

**Does Rootstock currently pose a threat to Ethereum?**

This depends. If smart contracts start to play a bigger and bigger role in powering decentralised applications, we might find that it will be unacceptable to host a smart contract on Rootstock.

This is because Rootstock is currently a federated sidechain (read: centralised) and relies on merge mining, a poor choice for security.

If smart contracts never move past the toy phase and are only being used to handle small amounts of money, etc.. it's likely Rootstock will be competitive to Ethereum.

As I believe that smart contracts, autonomous code, etc... will become a defining feature of the next technological movement, Ethereum will be far more attractive for deployment than Rootstock.

**Is there any real threat then?**

Yes! If someone figures out a way to:

1. Have a sidechain on Bitcoin that doesn't have the merge mining requirement.
2. And is still secure, with no chance of funds being stolen, (read: doesn't require mining.)
3. And is decentralised.

Ethereum may have a real problem.

**Conclusion**

At the moment the nature of the setup for Rootstock poses Ethereum no real threat.

However, a breakthrough with sidechains most certainly could cause a problem.

**Solution**

Ethereum should starting aiming to become Bitcoin faster than Bitcoin becomes Ethereum.

I know many of you have heard that line before, what does it mean and how do we get there?

Complete these projects:

1. Sharding.
2. Raiden.
3. PoS

But most importantly, to really unleash the above 3, we need to:

*Accept that ETH is also able to be used a digital currency that can directly compete with Bitcoin.*

I understand that is very controversial, however I believe that it's acceptance is important for Ethereum.",cryptocurrency,1479008275
personalfinance,"Gambling addiction, deep in high interest debt, months behind on rent, best plan of action?","My partner (not legally married) and I are both in our late twenties and have two children together. We have been together for 6 years. My partner has always had somewhat of a gambling addiction since I've known him, but over the past year it has spiraled out of control. Even worse, over the past two years I've been drawn into some ""problem"" gambling myself. I've probably lost 20k at various casinos over the past 2-3 years roughly estimating. I am now abstaining from gambling and realize how destructive my behaviors are. 

I a work at a professional job. At this point, I make about 46k/yr gross. I bring home 1350 biweekly net. I'm about to start a new job at the end of this month making 52k/yr gross. My partner is self employed and makes 80k a year before expenses and taxes. I'd estimate he probably brings home 50k/yr after expenses and he lies on his taxes/only claims income of 20k year so his taxes are minimal. He owes the IRS around 20k and is currently on a payment plan.

We live in a relatively low cost of living area, and are 3 months behind in our rent. It would have been two months but he gambled and lost novembers rent and has no way to repay it to me. I pay rent and all household bills on my income alone, as well as all my personal debt payments.I have approximately 10k in personal loans outstanding at 18-20% interest rates, as well as 2k in credit card debt at about the same rates. I have a car payment of 375 per month (17% interest rate). I have no student loan debt. All loans/credit cards are current with no late payments. I'd estimate his debt at about 20-25k outstanding (not including back taxes) at 18-20% interest as well. 4K in credit debt, and a car payment of 750/month. All of his money is currently going to pay off gambling debts. All of our debts are individual and not joint.

I'm tired of living this way and feeling extremely hopeless in my current situation. Deep down, I feel as though my situation is fixable, but my partner will continue to drag me down if I stay in the relationship. 

Is there any way I can fix this massive hole I'm in without bankruptcy or default?

personalfinance,"~20k debt, 4.1% avg interest rate, living at home","I am soon moving from temporary corporate housing back home.  My salary is in the mid-60s and I have $6300 in savings on top of saving aggressively for retirement (20% of my paycheck goes into a 401k).

The question becomes: how aggressively should I pay off my fed gov student debt at a fairly modest rate of ~4.1%?  The highest rate I have after paying off the highest interest loans first is a $5500 loan at 4.66%.

solar,Please give opinions on my solar quote?,"Hello Solar Redditors!

 I'm a long time Reddit lurker and finally made an account after discovering this subreddit while conducting solar research for the thousandth time. I've been toying with the idea of going with solar for a couple months now and have received a few quotes from big name solar companies (Direct Energy, RGS, Solar City, Direct Energy). While their pitches make solar seem amazing, I still have the feeling that it's too good to be true. After researching these companies a little further, I've found some horror stories when it comes to installation, warranties, ect. 

Recently, I had a small company that I found on AngiesList come out from Pennsylvania (I live in Southern New Jersey) to give me an additional quote. All of the reviews on AngiesList and other solar websites all have been extremely positive. After meeting with the salesman, I felt extremely comfortable with the company. The salesman was extremely knowledgeable and not pushy in the least. He was able to answer all of my questions and provided me a quote that I think is great. Now, obviously I'm not an expert and was hoping to get some feedback from the Reddit community. Here's a little bit of background and the actual quote:

Area- Southern New Jersey
System Type: 11.20 Kilowatt Grid Tied, Roof Mounted
(40) 280 Watt Solar Photovoltaic Modules- Hyundai 280 all black
40 Solar Edge Optimizers
1 Solar Edge Inverter
1 AC disconnect, PV production meter
Complete installation includes wire, conduit and disconnects- 10 year warranty on labor and installation.
Total- $31,584.00
Federal Tax Credit- (9,475.20)
Final out of pocket- $22,108.80

Warranties:
Company guarantees all work performed for ten years
Panels: Solar Panel Manufacturer Warranty-25 year tiered power output warranty
Solar Racks: 10-year manufacturers warranty
Inverter: 12 year manufacturers warranty (optional ext to 25 yrs)
Optimizers- Solar Edge 25 year manufacturers warranty

Last year our annual electric usage was 12,646, this system is expected to generate 12,891 kW per year. Also, we're planning on financing through Sungage Solar- 15 year loan @6.49% which brings our payment to 185.00 per month. I wish there was a way to get the interest rate lower but unfortunately we do not have enough equity in our home to apply for a home equity loan. 

Throughout the year our average electric bill is $200.00. The way I figure it (and I could be wrong) the SRECS should be able to cover a large portion of our bill per month and quite possibly give us some months where our electric is virtually free.

One last question- how do you guys feel about an extended warranty for the inverter? I believe the salesman said it's an additional $850, which would also be eligible under the 30% tax credit.

I appreciate your time reading this post- if anyone has any feedback or optional financing options that are better, please let me know!

Some of the changes that stick out to me include:

* Regarding the CFPB: Replace the current single director with a bipartisan, five-member commission which is subject to congressional oversight and appropriations.
* Repeal authority to ban bank products or services it deems “abusive” and its authority to prohibit arbitration. 
* Demand greater accountability and transparency from the Federal Reserve, both in its conduct of monetary policy and its prudential regulatory activity, by including the Housepassed FORM Act.
* Abolish the Office of Financial Research (OFR).
* Allow the SEC to triple the monetary fines sought in both administrative and civil actions in certain cases where the penalties are tied to the defendant’s illegal profits. Give the SEC new authority to impose sanctions equal to investor losses in cases involving “fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement” where the loss or risk of loss is significant, and increase the stakes for repeat offenders.
* Increase the maximum criminal fines for individuals and firms that engage in insider trading and other corrupt practices. 
* Repeal sections and titles of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule, that limit capital formation.
* Repeal the SEC’s authority to both prospectively and, possibly, retroactively eliminate or restrict securities arbitration.
* Repeal non-material specialized disclosures.
* Incorporate more than two dozen Committee or House-passed capital formation bills, including:

o H.R. 1090 – “Retail Investor Protection Act”

o H.R. 4168 – “Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act”

o H.R. 4498 – “Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act”

financialindependence,How does holding a mortgage affect your asset allocation?,"I have heard a mortgage be called a ""reverse"" bond before. I'm curious as to how you guys take your mortgage into account with regards to your portfolio and and how (if at all) you allow it to change your asset allocation. 

I am currently in a 3 fund portfolio with 60% domestic stock, 30% int stock, and 10% bonds. Total portfolio is worth about 40k. I just got a mortgage for 110k at 3.25%. I will be saving between 30-40k a year for the next couple years. Because the mortgage and interest rate are so small, the interest rate deduction doesn't help me (as far as I can tell) vs the standard deduction. 

Moving forward, should I...

1. Take the 10% of savings that I would have put in bonds and instead apply it to the mortgage since the mortgage is a higher interest rate than the bond dividends (combined with the fact that interest rates have no where to go but up so the value of the bonds should go down?)

2. Take 10% of the savings I would normally put into bonds, but because it makes no sense to own debt instruments at a lower rate than debt, put that money into stocks? (which one would expect to yield more than 3.25%). This would make me 100% equity. 

3. Make no changes to my asset allocation. 

How did your asset allocation change once you acquired a mortgage?

personalfinance,Should I help my father pay back a Parent Plus Loan he took out for me and mishandled over the years?,"TL:DR - Father took out a parent plus loan for me 7 years ago I really don't remember.  He mishandled it over the years and accrued tons of interest and penalties on it.  Now he wants me to help him pay it but I really want to tell him it's his problem to deal with, especially because he mismanaged it so badly.  My father's financial situation in many aspects is VERY poor, but mostly because of his doing and financial blundering,  but I can't help but feel bad for his situation.  However, trying to take any responsibility for this loan will be out of my financial ability too, so I have to figure out to handle this whole situation.    

----------

Seven years ago my father took out a parent plus loan for me for $20k.  I honestly have no recollection of this loan, but I wasn't really in the loop about the finances at this point and I also took out my own federal loans and cashed in a bunch of bonds for living expenses so I thought I was covered.  He said I was the one that asked him to take out the loan, but like I said, I don't recall this at all.  

Now, my father over the past few years has had a meltdown to say the least.  He had a midlife crisis and went in deep...  Drinking, Divorce, Drugs, horrific financial blunders, etc.  He apparently stopped paying all the bills 4 years ago and I really don't talk to him much.  I'll talk to him a few times a year and it's always some more ridiculous trouble he got in or him screwing up his life.  It's a shame because he a was a good man while I was growing up.  Let's just say he made one big mistake and his life has spiraled out of control since then and no one knows how to help him.  About two years ago I was going back to finish school and he asked me for enrollment papers so he could defer the loan.  I provided him all he needed, but every 2-3 months he would call me again saying he was having trouble deferring the loan and he needs more paperwork from me, even requesting the same documents sometimes.  This went on for two years.  

Now just recently, my father contacted me and is saying the loan company is suing him for negligence  and I MUST pay him money to help cover the loan.  I don't know what he did since the loan origination, but he said the current balance is now around 40k after interest and penalties, double the original principal.  Obviously he made some serious errors in managing it, and probably didn't pay a cent on it.  Nonetheless, he said that this is my loan and that it's unfair he needs to pay it back.  He said I had agreed to pay the loan when I was done with school and it sounds to me his perception of the situation is that he co-signed the loan when really it was his loan the entire time.  (Remember this is a parent plus loan).  He's telling me he got it transferred to him but now he needs to transfer it back or pay him money each month to help pay it down.  

Now... I've always been good with my finances, and all I want to tell him is ""sorry, but this is your problem"" and let him deal with it.  I have no liability in the matter and there is nothing to my knowledge he can do to make me liable unless I agreed to it.  That being said, while my relationship has been getting more and more distant each year, I've tried to maintain some relationship with him because he was not always like this and he was a fairly good father to me growing up.  Unfortunately, I feel like how I handle this situation may be the nail in the coffin to our relationship based on how I handle it.  

His current situation is grim.  My father has huge debts, lost his home, lost cars, has no retirement, no savings, and my mother is being pretty extreme with the amount of alimony she is demanding.  Their divorce has gone on for 3 years because my dad won't agree to the alimony but it's something like $350 a week (net) for 7 years.  My dad makes about 80k a year right now, but after all the garnishments and proposed alimony he would be down to about $300 new a week.  My mom would literally make more than him for not working at all!  Like I said, his debt is out of control.  He filed bankruptcy too, but apparently it didn't do much to get rid of his debt, it just bought him more time.  (He did Chapter 7 I believe).  

So I guess for me it's been both an ethical and financial dilemma for me.  He guilt trips me constantly about the loans and says this loan will ruin his life.  Honestly though, I don't have the money to give.  I currently have 30k of my own school loans to pay off, and they are deferred now.  Even once they are out of deferment, I'll have to negotiate an income based repayment plan unless I happen to receive a enormous raise  (50% or more) over the next year or two.  Is the right decision here to just tell him to deal with the loan and it's not my problem.  What's the best way for me to handle this without severing the relationship with my father completely?",finance,1479078719
personalfinance,Refinance home to pay off car loan,"I know that this is generally a terrible idea, but my wife and I are considering refinancing for a better rate and taking out a bit extra in the equity that we have to pay off a bad vehicle purchase. My wife and I purchased a new car in 2014 and were hosed. We traded in two other cars on this and made the mistake of rolling over quite a bit of negative equity. Two years later, we have simply paid off the negative equity but are now severely upside down on the vehicle.

We have moved out of our primary residence and have rented it out for the last two years for nearly 3x the mortgage(which covers the mortgage, tax, insurance and provides some residual/passive income).The house is valued at 150k and we owe about 100k on it. I'm considering refinancing(our credit is now in the higher 700s) to try and get a better rate and to pay off this car. We owe about 26k on the vehicle and it would free up about $600 extra a month.

We have adjusted our spending habits/behavior over the last two years and do not believe that we will use the money to buy new vehicles or anything else. I have a paid off vehicle, we have no credit card debt, have a 3-6 month savings and are wanting to send the extra $600 towards paying more towards the principal on the house. This property will continue to serve as a rental, I will not be purchasing a home until I officially retire (I move every 2-3 years so renting is a better option for me).

I know that the first thought is to sell the car, but we would more than likely not be able to sell it for more than 10 (private party), leaving us 16k in the hole. We did not have the best credit when I purchased the vehicle, so we received at 4.5% interest rate. Most mortgages beat that by a bit, which is another reason I have considered this option...ill save quite a bit in interest alone.

We will still refinance to secure a better rate, but I figured that it would be much easier to roll it all into one. We have a pretty secure tenant on contract in an great area, stable jobs and are fire minded. We have spent the last few years cleaning up our prior mistakes with great success and I feel that this will help us to reach our fire goal, even if we opt to sell the place later. Thoughts? Advice? Am I missing anything? The thought of finally getting out from under this thing may be clouding my better judgement, which is why I'm reaching out to hear some opinions/options/ideas.

However, I also want to open an IRA and start contributing to that as well, but I don't make enough to do both of these things simultaneously. 

When I buy a home, I have the option of using a VA loan, which means I won't have to pay PMI and technically no down payment is required.

Quick question because this seems like I am misscalculating something, but want to be sure. It sure seems like I will be oweed a lot come tax time. Apologies if language is off at all, english is not my first language.

I earn, pretax, $106000. $26k of this is technically a signing bonus but I'm unsure of if that matters. I have contributed the full $18000 and $5500 into my 401k and Roth IRA already this year. At the onset of the year, I chose to have 3 federal withholdings as I believe that is correct for my situation.

I am ussing this tax calculator (https://www.hrblock.com/get-answers/tax-calculators.html#/en/te/aboutYou).

I put total 2016 wages as 88000 (106000-18000), and federal income tax withheld as 21472 (my paycheque shows that roughly 1800 is taken out each month). I live in austin, TX so no state income tax.

The calculator spits out that I will be owed 5816$. That seems verry high. I am just taking standard deduction as I dont have any fancy deductions really to take that I know of. Is this right?

And if it is right, how should I adjust for next year? It seems I would need to up my federal withholing allowances to maybe like 8 or 9 instead.

The deal is that all of my debt is federal. I have about $12,000 in unsubsidized debt, which accrues at 6.8%. I also have one loan that is about $5k and compounds at 4.5%, but is subsidized.

Since the subsidized is already at a pretty low rate, I want to only refinance the debt that is at 6.8% and if I do that, Sofi will give me 4.99% over 5 years (fixed, of course). With that rate, my current monthly payment across all debt doesn't change at all. I know I lose the flexibility of federal loans, but I have a fantastic job that pays really well, and I feel I'm quite secure in it. Additionally, this will save me $3300 over the lifetime of the unsubsidized debt so I think this is a good call.

My pay check during the school year should be $334.80 and it should be $744 in the summer.

Is there any way I could write off that money so I don't have to pay taxes on it?

As far as paying my income taxes, would it be better to file it individually or with my parents income taxes? How would I know how much I would have to give my parents for taxes if we filed them together?

Now it's pretty safe to say I would be paying 10% federal income tax (since I will be making about $10.5k a year) but based on [this](https://smartasset.com/taxes/colorado-tax-calculator#hwJnZ3ZX9v) website it says I would only be paying $65 in federal income tax?

Also are there any ways I could write off income or sales tax on any items because I am a student?

Should there be anything else other than college I should be investing in?

   This will result in me not using spring 2018 s federal  loans and grants which I estimate should be about 5100 in total, 1000$ grant and 4000 loans. So I will have to take out a private loan for about 9000$ total.

* Out earlier to find a job

* Means I will take out about 9000$ in private loans

* I want to graduate after 5yr total spent instead of six( this rates highly for me)

* I  will technically have more time to pay back my loans

* I would like a loan with terms like the federal one is that a reasonable expectation

I will be going back into the corporate world in mid-2017 due to the relocation.


We have worked very hard to eliminate all debt and minimize our possessions and standard of living. Now the savings are accumulating and we are frozen on what to do. In the past we have purchased individual stocks based on limited investing knowledge, just belief in the company. This is sloppy and we know we can't continue this. I moved all my IRA/Investment accounts over to Vanguard and will be moving husband's accounts over as well (from eTrade).


We also know we shouldn't try to time the market, but current events are intimidating. We can afford admiral shares of bond funds, but I keep reading not to buy bonds because of upcoming interest rate increases. We could get some overall admiral stock funds, but if we dump a big chunk in now and this rally ceases, we just said goodbye to it all.

OVERALL SITUATION:

- HHI: 110k annual; will increase next year after I get back into a corporate gig

- 401k: Husband is maxing this out $18k/year. Currently have $65k in a Vanguard target 2040 fund.

- IRAs: We each contribute the max to our individual Roth or Traditional IRA accounts. We've been in a habit of contributing to both types of accounts so we have different tax options later on in life.

- HSA: Maxing it out at $6,750/year. Currently have $7k sitting in cash. Would like to start investing this but husband has had some recent health issues so we've kept it liquid.

- Emergency Savings: $15k in cash in an account earning a crappy .01%

- Retirement Goals: I'd love to save like crazy and retire/travel the world in 10 years. Husband is not so adventurous. So I think it would be a good compromise to try to retire early (in 25 years) while not necessarily scrambling for FIRE at 40.


DEBT:

- CC Debt: None

- Mortgage: Owe about $112k, 3.625% interest. $775/month 

- Car debt: None. 2 cars, paid off. One car is 10 years old and may need replacing.


CASH READY TO INVEST:

- Random Misc. Savings: $19k buffer money sitting in the business and personal checking accounts

- My Roth IRA: $24k total. $1,800 in SGOL, $1,700 in GLD, $1,800 in TSLA, $18,700 in cash. I understand that these gold ETFs are not good to hold long-term; bought them long before the election and lost my bet. I feel like it's OK to hold a little bit of a company like TSLA that we just think is super rad. But what the heck do we do with all the cash?

- My Traditional IRA: $15.6k total. $2,300 in CVS, $3,200 in Whole Foods, $10,000 in cash.

- Joint Vanguard Brokerage: $10k cash, just sitting there.

- Husband Roth IRA: $6,300, all in LNG and VLO. Husband bought these energy stocks a whole ago - I figure if we're stuck with them we should hang on to them for when prices go back up.

- Husband Traditional IRA: $4k, all in TSLA and DAL. I think DAL was a whim purchase probably on some news story.


This is quite a mess, huh? Would love some advice on how to get this cleaned up. Should we totally ignore all news channels and sort things into VTSAX, VTIAX and VBTLX all at once? Should we really avoid bonds right now, or not worry about it if we have decades to cash out? Should we try to spread out the organization over a few weeks or months?


TL;DR - We've eliminated all debt except a small mortgage, emergency savings are sound, and we're maxing all possible tax-benefit accounts (401k, HSA, IRA) - but we are very sloppy amateur investors. We're afraid of cleaning things up in one fell swoop because of current events. Help?

Its the difference between the two year treasury yield and the thirty year treasury yield. 

For those who are unaware, in the third quarter of 2016 - ORC was able to make 85cents a share profit with the yield spread as low as .66% which is really phenomenal and speaks to how well managed their portfolio is.

Besides obviously having too much debt and feeling the daily stress of needing to pay it down quickly, my major concern right now is my credit score, which has fallen drastically due to relying too heavily on my credit cards during a period of underemployment and maxing out my cards. I am wondering what would have the better affect on my credit score---paying $2,500 against the principle amount owed on each card, or paying the $5,000 toward one card only (the card with the slightly higher interest rate). 

I know that the ratio of credit available to me:credit used is a major factor in one's credit score but I'm unsure exactly how that ratio is calculated. Is that figure an overall total of credit extended to me via all credit cards and consumer loans? Or is it more of per card calculation. In other words, is it better to have lower utilization percentages on each card, or is the utilization percentage a total of all consumer debt? Hope this makes sense.",finance,1479148398

personalfinance,When to trade in a car,"I currently own a 2008 Dodge Caliber with 100,000 miles on it. This car has been the bane of my existence for the past year. I've sunk in easily $1200-1500 in repairs this year, with another big one potentially on the horizon (still waiting to get it checked out after it just started making all kinds of weird noises and shaking). I've had to replace tie rods, brakes, ball joints, and more. Basically, every month or two like clockwork something expensive falls apart on this thing. 

I'm wondering if it's time to finally throw in the towel on this thing. I was looking at getting a lightly used Corolla and trading my car in (should be worth in the ballpark of 3,000). Still, that would involve financing at least $10,000, even after the trade in. I have a good credit history so my interest rate should be reasonable, but I'm a little cash strapped right now while I support my fiancé through the rest of her school while simultaneously planning a wedding. 

Any thoughts on whether I should trade for a more reliable car? The monthly payment would suck, but I suppose I could temporarily eliminate my small 5% 401k contribution this year to make it work (employer contributes the same amount regardless of my contribution, it's not a match). 

I'm 23 years old by the way if that's in any way relevant.

personalfinance,Laying It All Out There. Please help 2017 be the year I get in control of my finances.,"Okay I am going to share my current financial state. I am aware that some of what is listed came from bad decisions. Feel free to re-point those out to me, but I am more hoping for the best options going forward.

Stats-
28 years old, Married and wife is 7 months pregnant.
Own a home and have been there for four years

Income-
Wife works at a nonprofit and makes take home pay (after taxes) of 1650/month.
My take home pay is $3782/month from my base and right now i have very volatile commissions that fluctuate between 0 and an extra 1500 take home pay each month.
Long Story short id say take home pay is 5400/month

Savings-
Lost my job two years ago and cashed out 401k at the time to pay some debt and cover expenses until i got my new job.
So current 401k is only $2600. have 4% of paycheck going there with a 2% company match. 
Also started an IRA and have $1200 in that right now. No other savings at all.

Debt- We owe 93k on the house still and got a 3.8% interest rate.
Have 6k in small personal loan.
Down to 5k in CC debt.
Student loans are all paid off.
Owe a family member 2k still, no interest but pay a hundred here or there when I can.
So total debt not including the mortgage is 13k

Monthly Bills-
Mortgage $802
Phone bill for Wife and I - $130
Internet and Cable -$75
Electric utility $140
Gas Utility $120
We do have an auto lease for my wife of $430. This is too much, but feel stuck and haven't found a good option.
My car is fully paid off
Insurance is $150
And we do tithe 10% off total take home so that would be $540
Total Monthly Expenses = $2400
PS Day care will start in May and be $600/month

Other Expenses-
We try to budget for eating out, groceries, health and beauty, dogs, xfactors like gifts, entertainment etc, but we dont do well on this and seem to spend a lot.

Thats the gist! So here are my questions-
What should i be doing different?
How much should we budget our expenses other than bills?
Should I be saving, paying down debt, payiong extra principal on the mortgage or a combo of all three?
How can i fix my lease situation?
How much should i be saving?
Advice for time where expenses go up, like once baby is born and daycare kicks in etc.

Goal is to get debt free, other than house, get a good emergency fund built back up. have a set plan monthly to not get back in a hole, and find a way to cut bills and expenses.

finance,Mortgage REITs and Steepening of the Yield Curve,"I think the next few years will bode well for mortgage REIT's like ORC as interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens. The steepening of the yield curve means that mortgage REITs will have more profit due to the arbitrage strategy they employ. 

This is the chart to keep an eye on: 

https://ycharts.com/indicators/302_year_swap_spread

Its the difference between the two year treasury yield and the thirty year treasury yield. 

For those who are unaware, in the third quarter of 2016 - ORC was able to make 85cents a share profit with the yield spread as low as .66% which is really phenomenal and speaks to how well managed their portfolio is.

The next few quarterly reports I think will show us how ORC will perform with the steepening of the yield curve.

personalfinance,Advice for a newbie in the world of personal finance,"Hello Reddit community,

I’ve dedicated myself to learning as much as I can about personal finance—but I must admit, it’s a bit overwhelming with all of the information available out there. I was given the advice that reaching out to all different people regarding personal finance is one of the best ways to gain a deeper perspective. So, here I go, I am hoping for some advice on my current situation.

Goals: I would like to figure out the best way to pay off my student loans. I currently feel like a large chunk of my monthly salary is going to my student loans. I’m also not sure if I should try to transfer my loans somewhere with lower interest. I also have considered consolidating my loans but it seems like my interest rate might go up even higher.

I would like to figure out the best way for me to be investing. I know that THIS is the time for me to start investing money (I’m 25) but I’m not sure if it’s worth it with my student loans looming over me. I’m also not sure how to get started.

I want to commit to a high yield savings account through online banking so I can be earning around 1% interest on my savings

I want to make sure I am saving enough for things like a down payment on a house and traveling—those are, really, my top 2 saving goals.

Salary Information: 
I work at a non-profit and my pre-tax salary is $49,500. My biweekly take home salary is $1,325 after taxes—thus putting me at 2,650 per month and 31,800 per year. I am set up at my job for a pension plan. Without having to contribute, my work puts in 10% of my salary (it’s a pretty sweet deal). I have the option of kicking in extra but I haven’t yet because I’ve been feeling the burden of my student loans and I didn’t know if it was worth it at this time.

Student Loan Information: 
I graduated with a Master’s degree in 2015 with around $43,000 in student loan debt. I currently have $41,300 in student loan debt split between 6 loans—5 federal loans and 1 private loan. 
Federal Loans: 
*All at 6.55% interest 
Stafford—unsubsidized $4600 
Stafford—unsubsidized $2600 
Direct Loan—unsubsidized $8,600 
Direct Loan—unsubsidized $9,500 
Direct Loan—unsubsidized $9,000

Private Loan: *7.125% interest Sallie Mae Smart Option $6,800 I currently am on a graduated payment loan for the federal loans. I pay $272.66 per month. I pay $159.31 per month for the private loan.

Car Payments: I commute to my work and need a new car. My car is $232 per month at 0.9% interest for a 5 year loan. I recently bought it and have yet to start payments—the first one is right around the corner.

Account Information: I currently have a checking and savings account at a brick and mortar bank that I’ve been using since I was around 16 years old. The interest I accrue on these accounts is pretty scant at 0.05%. I have around $3,000 saved in my savings account. I deposit around $600 per month into my savings—although now with my new car, that may look more like $450 per month. I use the checking account to as my primary account. I also have a credit card through the bank that I use sparingly. It has 9.24% interest. It’s not a particularly fancy credit card. I don’t get points or rewards or anything.

Living expenses: Rent: $625 per month Parking: $80 per month Gas: $80-100 per month Utilities: $80 per month Groceries: around $200 per month Pet expenses: $50-100 (ish—depending on the month)",finance,1479157418

Maybe even give your take on if you think it is good to get in at this point?

Since these 2 stocks were essentially stolen by the US government during the bailout from all of the stock owners, with Trump now in office he will obviously push hard to have the stock given back to the stock holders which would obviously be beneficial to Perry and Icahn.  The stock valuations should be more around $20 and $25 respective but are selling for around 1/5th of that now.  My buddy did mention fully that this a gamble as you have no idea what roadblocks but I see it as a pretty good gamble.

Or should I apply for a personal loan?,"I'm enrolled in a pretty inexpensive public university for graphic design (har har art degrees are pointless, I get the joke) and this is my first term. I have an AA from doing Running Start and transferred to the school still not fully knowing exactly what I wanted to do, but wanting to learn more about graphic arts. I'm looking into an online school (Animation Mentor) that I've heard really decent reviews on, from people who have actually mastered the courses and received their certificates and have found jobs in the field. (I know it's a competitive field.) I'm not looking for advice to switch careers, because I know I want to do this, but I'm unsure of how to go about it.

The online courses are ~2500 USD for each two week course. People have said if you're dedicated and hard working you can balance going to school with a full time job, and to be completely honest my work load isn't too stressful right now. The online school doesn't accept student aid. Here me out, I was wondering if it would be a completely stupid idea to take advantage of my unsubsidized loans in order to fund the online school? My interest rate is about 4% for these types of loans.

I have OK-ish credit (680 something), no negative credit history but not a lot of credit history. My dad would willingly co-sign on a loan with me, but I'm wondering if that would be pointless considering the higher interest rates. 

I'm unemployed but going to start working in spring (can't drive in snow and work means commuting.) Right now I'm selling my paintings for extra cash. But this also pulls into the fact that I left a job I was at for two and a half years and now have a gap in my employment history due to trying to pursue my uni education &amp; relocating. I know lenders typically look for employment &amp; credit, neither of which I really have.

I have a car payment I could potentially cut, also, but am unsure of how to go about that. At this point the bank basically owns the car, I owe around $12,000. I pay 300 a month, almost a third of that going to interest. (Not a smart move, wasn't my first choice, and was in a desperate situation.) My fiancee has a car that basically just sits and said I can use his whenever. This is separate from the question, but if anyone had any ideas about how to go about either lowering this payment or ""selling"" back a car that has negative equity possibly to trade-in, I'd be appreciative too.

personalfinance,I'm struggling. Flat broke and struggling to make enough each month to cover cost of living. Need advice.,"So I have no idea where to start. I've read the intro guides to this sub and none of it really applies to my situation. My age group (22) is for people who've finished school and have an income they can live on. I'm in a really shitty situation where I literally don't make enough to cover my cost of living and have been trying to find a second job for months with no luck so I'm really looking for some advice.

I moved from NY where I was making ~11k/yr but I was in school and could live on that, to Va where I make 16k a year and can't. I rarely (I don't) go out to eat, don't do anything fun unless it's free, try to avoid using gas unless necessary. I'm currently in the process of switching my residency to VA to so I can apply for food stamps. 

I'll start by breaking down my expenses and income. 

* -$700/mo rent (includes internet and utilities) (and that's sharing the cost with a roommate in a cheaper apartment)
* -$265/mo federal student loans (did not complete a degree- dropped out medical issues/surgeries got in the way) (I got a forbearance for 6 months that ended 3 months ago and I already applied twice for income based repayment- this is what they came up with and won't change it)
* -$200/mo car payment (to my parents who have 0 interest and super lax about me missing payments)
* -$110/mo credit card debt (minimum payment)(have over 4.5k in debt on the card almost maxed out)(chase freedom 19.5% interest had the card for 3+ years)
* -$25/mo cellphone bill
* +$1,122/mo after taxes and the required deduction for retirement fund (paycheck of $561 on the 15th and 30th)
* $32 in my checking account. 

If I don't pay my car loan to my parents then I have $22 per month to afford gas, food, cat/dog food. 
 
I work in an elementary school as an instructional assistant (with special education) and I love the job. I want to go back to school so I can become a teacher in sped. Completing a degree would require some savings of which I have none and at the moment it looks like I'll never have any. If I can complete my degree I'd be able to teach provisionally and my income would jump to ~$3,400/mo. 

I'm trying to keep the goal of saving to go back to school in mind but I don't know how I can save when I don't even know how I'm supposed to pay my current bills. I literally have no money to even budget.

Looking for advice on how to increase income, cut bills, or any programs that could be of assistance throughout the next year.**

Family: My boyfriend (24) and I (20) moved in together (Northern California) a few months ago. He moved from Colorado after we'd had a several month LDR, so his support system is several states away. My mom is 30 minutes away (but she has three children under 12 to take care of) and my dad is a couple hours from here. Moving out of the area is a non-option for the next 18 months as I'm finishing up my two AS degrees at a community college I'm especially fond of.

Work: He works night shift as a local trucker, brings in between $1200-1500 after taxes every two weeks. I just quit my job at Walmart a week ago due to management and was hired on by JC penneys as a seasonal employee for the next 2-3 months or so, but that won't start for another two weeks and they're only offering me 15 hr/wk as opposed to the 30 I had with Walmart. I'm expecting to only make $280 every two weeks, so income is obviously suffering. My father gives me $300 per month to help me out a little while I'm in school, my mom can do occasional non-financial favors when an emergency arises. Other than that, we're on our own. 

School: I attend school full-time (15-18 units every semester), don't qualify for any grants due to my dependant student status. I'm able to take out $4000 in loans in January and another $5000 in September. I fully plan on doing this since the interest is so low (4.3% and interest only begins once I graduate in four years), but **I need advice on what to use it on.**

Vehicle: Almost two years  ago when he was desperate for a vehicle with a poor credit score he took out an auto loan. We pay $464 per month on a recent dodge ram. The interest rate is 21% and making the minimum payment per month I think it'll be paid off in five years. He originally took out a 19k loan and it's now down to 16k after two years. It also needs a few repairs due to allowing a family member to drive it for a year and they did not take care of it. Cracked windshield, thin tires, old oil, detailing needed, smoke damage, etc. Safe to say I'm extremely unhappy about this expense. His credit is worse off than before (400s) and I'm just starting to build mine (580) so I don't think we could get a better rate. **Any ideas?**

Expenses: **I'll include a sample spreadsheet of a normal month for anyone who reads better that way.** Our rent (moderately nice 2b2b apartment in a college town) is $1280, and we're stuck in a lease until February. Truck payment is 464 and insurance 97. PG&amp;E is around 130 in winter even though we very rarely use heat or ac. Internet 71, water/trash 50 (flat rate, can't be changed), phone 280, gas 300 (he works 30 minutes from home), my bus pass is 20, and we have minimum credit card payments of 75 per month (everything is 6-12mo financed though so no interest for a bit). Finally, groceries for both of us are about $300. We shop at Grocery outlet and Walmart only, and I am forced to eat gluten free (nearly died at age five) plus I recently found out I'm pregnant so I don't think groceries can be cut back much if at all. 

[Sample spreadsheet](http://puu.sh/sixDw/2da946a380.png)

Pregnancy: I found out just this weekend and we decided to keep it. I'm four weeks along right now and we're also getting married in a month--that's super important to me with a baby on the way. I'm covered by my dad's insurance until I'm 25, but I just found out that it won't cover anything baby-related for a dependant. So I need insurance for the pregnancy but am unsure if I'll qualify for govt-assisted insurance if we get married (38k annually). I know WIC is an option but likewise unsure if it'll cover me. It seems like most resources are meant for single mothers. **Any ideas on what might be available to me and where I can find them?**

Conclusion: I've been precariously balancing the budget for several months and while money is tight, I've made it work. However, with my reduced income and upcoming additional expenses I'm getting extremely worried. **Any advice on income, expenses, what to spend my student loans on** (would it be good to pay off the truck? get a different vehicle somehow? or something else entirely?), **and what pregnancy-related resources might be available to me would be greatly appreciated!**",finance,1479172973

I have to say, in over 40 years, WFB has NEVER fulfilled any financial need I've had.  Need a credit card? Sorry, no F*ing way.  Like to refinance that mortgage? Maybe, but only if you pay 3x the going interest rate.  Business financing? Out of the question!

Emerging markets have been dumping US treasuries, the Fed can't raise rates because they can't afford to pay the interest and now they'll likely have to keep rates at Rock bottom to finance the next round of deficit spending!

investing,Thoughts on bond allocation with the present interest rate/post-election environment?,"As many people do, I use ETFs to achieve my overall asset allocation with low fees and to get good diversification. Currently, my bond portfolio is composed of a mix of AGG and BND, which are government and investment grade bond ETFs with ~5 year avg maturity. The downside of using bond funds is the lack of principal protection compared to holding the bonds themselves. Given that the fed is likely to raise rates in December (reducing the share value of bond ETFs), and Trump seems to be planning on deficit spending like crazy (implying that government bond interest rates will rise further), I'm concerned about capital erosion with my current strategy. 

I have been considering diversifying my bond allocation by using investment grade or government shorter term (1-3 year) ETFs to reduce my interest rate sensitivity, or purchasing some 5 year TIPS in the next auction.

personalfinance,"Freelancing, can't find stable work, and for the third time in 3 months I've been left out to dry by a client without pay. [Current Financial Mess]","Hey reddit,

To start off, I moved from my home state 6 months ago to pursue my career as a 3D character artist, which I have more than 5 years experience as a freelance/hobbyist as, and am currently going back to college to get my degree after losing a full-ride scholarship several years ago.

I haven't been paid in 3 months. One of the firsts ""real jobs"" I landed was a start-up that sounded fantastic, and while I was skeptical as I should have been, they seemed like they had their stuff together. We agreed upon $2000 per month working part time at first, but the first 4 days were me starting in the middle of a crunch, so 40 hours in 4 days was understandable. Half a week later, I hadn't heard anything, so after calling around I got the feeling I'd been stiffed - however when I called up the CEO and asked for compensation, he agreed - but only paid me $500 for my 40 hours of work that saved their company from missing their biggest deadline, essentially $12 an hour. Pathetic, but it was pay.

The past 3 months after, I've been attempting to find work in my area and online to no avail. The three jobs I've gotten since have wasted my time, and have gone radio silent when I ask for compensation, and on all 3 of these I'd yet to send any files to the clients before they went silent when questioned on pay.

Now, 3 months later, I have $27 left in credit and -$415 (thanks to Wells Fargo reopening Overdraft Protection when I specifically didn't have it a year ago) in my checking account, and I'm unable to find work that has the explicit promise of pay, or is willing to pay more than what I could make working at a Starbucks. To top it off, I was forced to shut down my portfolio website last month as I couldn't afford the yearly lump sum payment, and as of December 1st my software subscriptions will be void if I can't make enough money to cover them.

I haven't had a car since I moved. At this point I don't know what to do. I've been trying https://99designs.com/ for the past week and a half to no avail, and I'm overqualified (2.5 years retail manager experience, 2 years experience as wholesale COO, 5 years freelance/hobby experience in my current field) for working in retail (not that there are many in my area). I ride public transportation into the city to attend college, and by the end of next week my card for that will empty and I won't have a way to get to school.

As of now, I have 2 $100 bills in my wallet, and I'm afraid to deposit them to pay back my checking overdraws as I'm saving them for an emergency (like paying fares to get to school).

To top it off, I haven't been able to pay the $1024 tuition left for me to pay this semester, and won't be able to sign up for next semester until it's paid.

I've been half-lying to my family back home about how well I'm doing, but the stark reality is that while I have found jobs I haven't been paid for any of them, and I'm on a ledge right now.

personalfinance,Balance transfers: Worth it for moderate amounts ($1000 or less) of CC debt?,"Here's the deal: Back in 2013 I had just moved out on my own for the first time, got stupid, and signed up for a ""college credit card"" from Wells Fargo. It had a $1200 limit and GODawful interest rates, but that's besides the point.

Like most 21 year olds with their first credit card, I was an idiot and didn't manage my money. Before I knew it I had almost reached that $1200 limit. So I shredded the card. I'm still carrying a balance on it, yes, but it's down to a little under $1000 now. I'm also very particular about paying on-time and more than the minimum each month (Minimum is $38, I usually toss somewhere around $50-60 at it each time).

personalfinance,Filing Chapter 7 from the EU- $37k debt,"Hi PF,

Throwaway because I don't want this associated with my main account. As you can see from the title, I'm exploring the idea of filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and I'm wondering how this is complicated by living abroad. I have done some research online and contacted some attorneys local to my home city in America, but any other advice would be appreciated as well.

I realize that bankruptcy is a touchy subject, and I full acknowledge that I am at fault for the situation I am in. I would pay this debt if I could. I **want** to pay it, but am just not able to.

I currently make €20,000/year and take home €1,600 per month broken down as follows:

Rent: €500

Credit card: €566

Personal loan: €166

Student loans: €134

Public transportation: €100

Health insurance: €40

Gym: €19

As you can see, my expenses are about €80 less than my take home pay and doesn't include my phone or food. I don't use Netflix, don't eat out and don't have a car. I could possibly scrape by with that €80 for food, but if anything unexpected comes up (as it always seems to), I basically have to choose which bills to pay and which to let go past due.

Right, my credit cards and personal loan total about $37k in unsecured debt (credit cards and personal loan), which is what would be discharged in filing a Chapter 7 (from my understanding). My credit cards are all currently on a credit management plan, which is the €566 payment.

My student loans (federal and private) total about $45k.  It's my understanding that student loans cannot be discharged, which is perfectly fine with me. I'm on income based repayment for the federal loans and I was able to work with my loan companies for temporarily lowered payments on my private loans. If my secured debt were to be discharged, I could make these payments easily.

I racked up most of my credit card debt when I was making considerably more money and living at home. There is about $25k in unexpected medical expenses and the rest was frivolous spending. I'm aware that this was a careless and short sighted way to live, but it's the situation that I'm in and I want to do as best I can to rectify the situation.

Right now, I am in a professional trainee position in a European capital city and this is the standard rate of pay with nominal increases each year of your contract (3 years). If there is a silver lining to any of this, it's that I love my job, and in 3 years I should be at a much more sustainable level of income. If I could press pause on my debt and repay it then, I would.

Because I have little to no assets in America (~$50 in a bank account), I've been told that creditors will have little recourse in coming after me, but if I just stopped paying everything will fall into collections and I'll get judgments against me, so while it's an option to just not pay, it doesn't sit well with me and I feel like it would just be more stressful in the long run.

My questions are:

* Does anyone have any experience with filing Chapter 7 from overseas? I have contacted a few attorneys in my home city and am waiting for replies, but any anecdotal information might be helpful too.
* I'll still be responsible for paying my student loans, but will this affect my cosignor in any way? My aunt cosigned for me and the last thing I want is for her credit to be affected because of my mistakes.
* Does this seem like the right course of action? Any other advice?

If you've read all of this and have any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. I know the subject of bankruptcy can be touchy so I just want to thank you sincerely if you have any advice to share.",finance,1479204231

financialindependence,Should I change my bond allocation post election? (based in USA),"Hello FIREs! I am well on my way to FIRE, and I am concerned that I am using the wrong approach for asset allocation in this post-Trump world. The AA I'm using is 80% equities, 10% bonds, and 10% REITs, with all REITs and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

With Trump's plans pointing towards large amount of deficit spending on infrastructure projects (which will increase interest rates) and the market stability pointing towards the Fed finally beginngin to raise rates, I have become concerned about capital erosion.

I currently hold my entire bond allocation in BND &amp; AGG, which are roughly equivalent government &amp; investment grade bond ETFs with an average maturity around 5 years. My worry is that even though bonds have already taken a hit, when the rates actually rise, they'll continue to decrease. (For those who aren't familiar with bonds, rising interest rates means increased yields but existing bonds become worth less than their par value).

My question is this: should I buy some actual bonds, like series EE, TIPS, or corporate bonds on the market? The advantage here is that they'll actually pay out their par value, which would solve the capital erosion problem, but then I lose the diversification benefits of bond funds. Another choice would be to alter my bond fund allocation by exchanging some of the 5 year avg maturity funds with 1-3 year avg maturity funds, which would reduce the rate sensitivity (so capital erosion would be lessened) at the cost of reduced performance.

How do you manage your bond allocation? What do you think about holding individual bonds vs. bond funds?

edit: The idea here is that for FIRE, I am more concerned about capital preservation than a normal investor would be. The retirement horizon I'm looking at is the 5-10 year range.",finance,1479221097

personalfinance,"24 year old looking for advice on retirement, loan repayment, and savings.","I was going to post a simple question on the moronic monday thread but then it became more complicated as I thought it through so I thought its own thread might be better. So I'll start with my question after I give some background on me that might help make everything make more sense:

Recent(2 years out) college grad, barely scraping by at the beginning of this year and decided to make a career change into tech, but I had to take a loan out to cover the $8k bootcamp to do that. Money aside, it's been completely worth it. I was miserable and now I'm much better off as far as happiness and finances go. So starting in July, I've been making 40k and getting my shit together. The company is switching to a new 401k provider(if that's what it's called?) so I figured it was time for me to take a minute to figure out a plan for retirement, or at least think about it. So here's my question:

Is the only difference in 401k and IRA when you put in the money? I tried reading up on it but they sound the same other than 401k come straight from wages and IRA you put in money out of pocket.

My work has a 401k that has no matching that I'm automatically enrolled in at 4% of my wages. I can change the percentage to up to 90% but so far have just let it do its thing(hasn't been a priority since I've moved to a new city and have been living on my own for the first time ever, learning to adult is hard).

I'm wondering if it makes sense to keep putting money into the 401k(I can choose between traditional or roth) or looking into an IRA or do a combination of both? The CEO has been saying that the company is working on getting matching for the 401k but that seems like one of those Soon^TM situations that may never happen.

Also I've read up that 10% is the minimum of what a person should look to put into retirement which I'm not at currently, but I took out a $7700 loan back in April with a pretty high interest rate(it's like 30% I think? I'd have to check and report back here) that I want to pay back ASAP. Does it make sense to hold off on upping my retirement contributions to pay off this loan faster to avoid that interest? I've been working on saving and building up an emergency fund so I could cut down on how much I'm putting in for that but I'd rather not since I don't have much in there in the first place.

Anyways, I'd really like some advice on what might make the most sense for me to do, what my options are etc. It's been nice just focusing on creating a budget and having enough to take care of myself the past few month(replaced a 2.5 year old broken phone, got new glasses for the first time in 4 years, and am a happy owner of a kitchen table, and etc. things I haven't been able to afford before).

personalfinance,What now? I have followed PF for the last two years and am doing great financially. How can I take it to the next level?,"Hello, long time lurker, and this is a throw away as I am very private.

I am M26y/o from New Zealand. 

I used to have personal debt of NZD$10,000 and NZD$37,000 student loan. I have paid both off as of October 2016.

I have also bought an investment property in another city for NZD$315,000 using a 10% deposit which I saved for. There are tenants renting out the house, covering the mortgage, I only pay rates &amp; insurance which equates to $100pw. That $100p/w also covers contingency such as repairs &amp; maintenance. I have put aside 1% of the property's value for repairs and maintenance per year. Sidenote - the house has increased in less than a year quite substantantly due to the crazy NZ property market and is now valued at $370,000. I am not going to sell it, nor take equity out of it. I have taken advantage of historically low interest rates to lock in a couple of years at 4.19% (this is very low for NZ, we can only lock mortgages in for 5 years max)

I recently got a new job, remote only for an international software company and am moving overseas - France probably. This job pays NZD$100,000p/y or approximately USD$71,000 depending on the currency exchange rate. 

I want to save for my MBA at a very good school, but expect that I will be able to get some scholarships to pay at least part of the estimates cost of $120,000.

My expenses are very low - just rent &amp; food. I grew up poor, and made a new years resolution this year to see if I could not buy anything (excluding food &amp; toiletries) - apart from experiences. I am doing much more travelling and have a travelling account which I deposit money into every fortnight.

I also have approximately $30,000 in my retirement account, am actively contributing 3% of my salary (Not sure if I should keep it or get it out based on the fact that millennials will not retire until they are in their 70's. Perhaps super will not even exist then based on the burden that has been placed in it by baby boomers living longer and longer).

I have an emergency fund of approximately $10,000 &amp; a couple of thousand in a peer-to-peer lending account at 11%p/a. 

I am nervous about buying another house in NZ as the property market is extremely overvalued and due for a crash. The share market seems to be unstable due to high P/E ratios resulting from investors moving to shares as bonds are historically low or negative. Index funds seem to be a good options, but I am wondering what else could I look at? Perhaps investing in emerging markets like MINT countries?

I'd like to add a few more points:

1. The $7500 electric car subsidy only applies to the first 200k electric cars sold. It will start phasing out after that point and will be completely gone after selling 350k cars. Tesla will pass that point sometime after early 2018, and the market should have priced in this fact long time ago.

2. Current federal solar subsidy or rather the [Solar Investment Tax Credit](http://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/ITC%20101%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%2004-19-2016.pdf) was passed end last year. It's good at least until 2020, and overturning it will not be easy.

personalfinance,Interest rates about to spike. Should I sell my house now?,"I live in the Midwest in a town that experiences a ton of growth over the past 5 years. My house is very centrally located in town and has increased in value about 25% since I bought it four years ago. With my current mortgage, I'm locked in at a very low interest rate - 3.6%, 30 yr fixed.

My previous plan was to sell my current house and move to a similarly-priced house farther out of town in the Spring. This would take advantage of higher housing prices and the more competitive market (as a seller), but the recent election and rising interest rates have me worried.

If interest rates are going to spike, I could sell now, but winter is coming quickly. This is the real midwest--regular snow and temperatures will be below freezing in month. It seems like the market is generally depressed with snow on the ground, so there will be fewer choices for a new home, and fewer buyers for my current one. Personally, I'd also have a lot of work to do right now to get my house cleaned up and ready to sell (not a lot of free time at the moment).

Do you think 4-5 months could make such a significant amount of change in interest rates, that throwing out my previous plan would be a good idea? I feel like I'm being brash by even considering it, but I really don't want to be signing a 7% mortgage in April.",finance,1479238400

# Description

CSX Corporation provides rail-based transportation services, including rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers. 

* The Company's merchandise business consists of shipments in diverse markets, such as agricultural products, phosphates and fertilizers, food and consumer, chemicals, automotive, metals, forest products, minerals, and waste and equipment. 
* The Company's coal business transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and industrial plants, as well as exports coal to deep-water port facilities. 
* The Company's intermodal business combines the rail transportation with the short-haul flexibility of trucks and offers long-haul trucking.

So it looks like the perfect cyclical play on the economic recovery.

## Recent financials 

Sales have been stable for the last 5 years, profits too, which is a surprise to me. And the management's been busily buying back stock that's helped drive up earnings per share.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $11.8bn | $12.7bn | $10.0bn | $11.8bn | $11.8bn|
|Operating Profit | $3.6bn | $3.6bn | $3.5bn | $3.5bn | $3.5bn|
|EPS | $2.00 | $1.92 | $1.83 | $1.79 | $1.70|
|DPS | $0.70 | $0.63 | $0.59 | $0.54 | $0.45|

And looking at the figures for the first 9 months, point to a flat to declining topline and margin. So it's really strange to see the stock has performed really will this year!

## Competition

In their annual they say

&gt; The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive.  Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price.  Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. CSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory.  

In fact there really aren't a lot of railroad companies to benchmark them against. Though we can see that their margins and returns are in line with their key competitor NSC.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
CSX Corporation | $10,813M | 41% | 15%
Union Pacific Corporation | $19,981M | 46% | 21%
Norfolk Southern Corp. | $9,916M | 40% | 13%
Kansas City Southern | $2,334M | 48% | 12%

## Cash / Debt?

CSX Corporation has $9,764M of net debt. That is 2.2x it's latest operating profit. So nothing much to worry about here.

# Wall Street thinks?

Oddly, The professionals on Wall Street have a $32.34 for CSX which is 7% below the current price... but their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. It's as if the brokers haven't updated their forecasts! Or worse, they are upgrading and upgrading to keep up with the stock price's rise. :(

# Valuation

Wow are the valuations bunched... and they aren't far off the ""asset light"" logistics businesses UPS on 19x and Fedex on 15x times forecast sales.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/csx.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
CSX.O | $32,577M | 19x | 6% | 2% | 11%
UNP | $81,942M | 20x | 7% | 2% | 10%
NSC | $30,359M | 19x | 11% | 2% | 11%
KSU | $9,155M | 19x | 9% | 2% | 10%

So, it doesn't feel expensive, but it still feels strange that the prices have ramped even though the earnings aren't increasing.

Why is the market re-rating the railroads?

# Dividends

CSX Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.73 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.70 per share. The forecast dividend of $0.73 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.79.

And on top of dividends CSX likes buying back stock too.

# Catalysts

So here's where I start to scratch my head:

* In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 24% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%.
* In the last 6 months the stock price has moved by 38% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%.
* the forecast for 2017 is for $1.97 of earnings versus $1.79 today, i.e. up 10%

So why on earth has the valuation gone from 14x earnings to 19x earnings in the last 6 months when the business...seen sales off 11% in the last 9 months and earnings down 16%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they said

&gt; Overall our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar.

So what am I missing, if this a tangential play on a recovering oil price? On a more friendly oil price?

personalfinance,27 years old making 120k a year with 200k student loans. How do I get out behind this?,"Hey all,

So here is my situation:

I'm 27 years old, making 120k plus bonuses. I am currently living in NYC, where my rent and utilities are $1300 a month. 

I went to a private art college and needed a bunch of private/fed loans to make it work. Currently, I owe about 200k to Navient and another loan provider. My parents were not able to pay off any of the interest while I was in school so it just sat there, growing larger and larger. I have 5 different loans in Navient alone some of which are at a 12% interest rate. With the current amount I am paying now ($1000 a month) I am barely touching the principle balance. I looked into SOFI to consolidate but they are looking for payments of $2300 a month, and I don't think I can swing that. 

What other options do I have to get out of this mess?

personalfinance,Seeking Any Advice On Student Loan Repayment,"Hi /r/pf,  
  
Long time lurker, 1st time poster. Posting on behalf of my girlfriend who is not savvy to the ways of Reddit.  

She recently graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree that isn't very marketable (Wildlife Conservation).  
Her grace period for loan repayment ends at the beginning of December, and neither of us really know what to do.  
  
Here is the breakdown of her loans:  
* 4 Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loans Totalling $25k  
* 1 Direct Stafford Subsidized Loan Totalling $5.5k  
* Sallie Mae Smart Option Student Loan $17k @ 8.625%  
* Sallie Mae Smart Option Student Loan $17k @ 7.625%  
* Sallie Mae Smart Option Student Loan $22k @ 9.125%  
* Grand Total around ~$86k  

She is currently employed part time as a dog walker, making a little over $1k/mo. She is in the process of seeking an additional part time job, but so far has had no luck. Correspondence from Sallie Mae indicates that her minimum monthly payments will total $800/mo for those loans alone.  
  
While we are both familiar with the idea that she should be paying off her largest interest rate loans first, we're struggling to wrap our heads around whether she's even going to be able to make the minimum payments on time every month. We've done some preliminary searching, but we're not fully sure what her options are, in regards to both her federal and private loans. I am still in university, and as such I don't have experience dealing with this stuff personally.  
  
We're both in panic mode at the moment, and probably not thinking as clearly as we should be. Any advice or consolation would be greatly appreciated.  
  
Thanks /r/pf",finance,1479245837

personalfinance,What Else Can I do to Boost My Credit Score? (620),"Hi! Recently I have taken charge of my finances, all thanks to this subreddit! A little over a year ago I got a new job that pays pretty well-after taxes, 401k, stock purchase plan and all insurances I take home about 2400 a month. I've used that to buy a new car, make consistent payments on my student loan and get a $500 credit card. 

About a year ago my credit score was sitting at a 432 (I know, cringe worthy) but was able to get my car, and that's when I started making payments on my student loan (my score jumped up about 100 points). Then when I got my cc card about 2 months ago, it jumped up another 100 points to where I am now at a 620. 

My question is would there be any other obvious things I can do to boost my score more? I know keeping my cc utilization under 30% will help, and I've never been late on my cc or car. (I have been late on the student loan) 

One of my goals is to get my car payments down ($216/month @ 17%) as my score was so bad before I couldn't get a low interest rate. Should I refinance now? 

I really would like to build toward getting some sort of travel rewards card, as I would like to start traveling more often. However those types of cards normally require you have a really good credit score.",finance,1479249929

First, the tl;dr:

Now:
I'm an engineer who makes good money and I need to improve my credit score to prepare for my future. Last year I financed a car at a horrible interest rate, but making payments on that (my first car loan) has brought my credit up substantially, 80-100 points.

I keep getting settlement offers from collection agencies. Should I save the cash and settle them? Is it far better to pay in full? Should I request a ""pay for deletion"" like I've seen others mention?

Last week, less than 3 weeks from our closing date, my lender emailed me asking for proof of my amortized student loan/info on my repayment schedule.
A number of problems with this.
1) I currently pay less than what that would be
2) I am in the middle of a loan forgiveness program for public sector workers
3) Why am I being asked about this now, if I have already been pre approved ?

If my monthly payment is too low, the loan won't be amortized, and if it is too high, my debt to income ration is a deal breaker.

What options do I have here? Can I ask fedloan for a longer term on my loans so that my monthly payment is lower? I've already gotten pre approved, doesn't my lender have to honor that agreement? What happens to my earnest money if this falls through?

How does your credit card know if it is making a balance transfer? 

I have a direct debit for the minimum amount set up each month, in case I don't have enough to cover charging the full amount. 

It shows up in my bank statement as ""Direct Debit Payment to Capital One Ref xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx""

When I pay extra on top to clear the balance it shows up as ""Card Payment to Capital One Europe, XXX.XX GBP, Rate 1.00/GBP on XX-XX-XX""

This is my second house, just sold the first one last month and am just waiting on a closing date for the 2nd house. When I originally applied for this mortgage I opted for the 30 year that also included the closing costs because the house I am buying needs some repairs so I figured I would save some money up front to put towards that. I never locked in my rate and since last weeks election the rate went up .75% which is now probably an extra $100 a month for the monthly payment. I called the bank to switch the loan to a 30 year without the closing costs rolled in as it saves .25%. The woman at the bank called me back to tell me they could switch it but had I thought about the 10/1 arm. I told her I would call back in the morning and let her know. I've never looked into adjustable rate mortgages as I would prefer to know what I am paying each month. But the interest rate right now for the 10/1 is 2.5% and for the 30 it's 3.75%. Obviously the first 10 years the 10/1 is the better option but is it better in the long run? Barring an early death or divorce I will definitely be in this house for at least 30 years. The mortgage amount that I am borrowing is $296,000 if that's relevant.

So I have about $3200 in CC debt with a 10% interest rate. My credit union offered me a 12 month, $1200 holiday loan at a 6% interest rate. Would it be wise for me to accept the loan and apply it all towards my CC?

TLDR: Was a Wolf with Wind Pirates.

Alright, for all the hate it gets, mine was Minecraft.

I joined a Pirate themed server about 2 years ago (haven't played in 8 months) and eventually joined a crew. We called ourselves the Wind Empire. My name is actually taken from the founder, but don't tell him that. 

We had some amazing times, the three of us that were active. There was Prank (I'm not giving their real username, just what we called eachother), Ventura (a CoC wizard), and me (Wolf). 

We lived in this awesome castle on a mushroom island called Shroomwind, where the coast was griefed from huge attacks by enemies. The things we did were so damn fun, we raided people, got drunk off the brewing plugin, made ships, and blew eachother up with cannons. 

The best story I have is the Siege of Shroomwind. Prank was gone that day, and we had pissed of some people. Luckily the crew had grown, because there was a shit ton of people attacking the castle. We ran around the walls and shot a fuckton of arrows at the invaders and blew up a member of the staff (lol). Took a long time, but we won. Called ourselves the Wind Pirates afterwards.

Eventually Prank went inactive after several months of our Brotherhood. Ventura followed. Then my computer crapped out. I came back months later and it just wasn't the same. Ventura was back, but he had joined another crew. Prank had secretly made his own server, which I found out about via some stalking. 

Still wish we could get the gang back together. Its been 2 years. Doesn't even have to be Minecraft. Whoever said internet friends aren't real friends, go fuck yourself. We were bros of the highest caliber (in my mind at least). 

Thanks for reading this. I have a lot of good memories and emotions from the Wind Pirates. Wish we could go back to the simpler days without school and just chill all day. Side note, I found Prank a while ago and we binged Minecraft for 14 hours.",technology,1479266164

I have two sets of loans. For the sake of simplifying numbers, I have $36,000 total in loans from Firstmark (four loans, all with variable interest rates, currently at 3.4%), and $27,000 total from Navient (five loans, unsubsidized and subsidized, all with different rates varying from 3.4%-6.8%).

The RePayment Plans-

Navient-
I currently have enough money in my bank account to completely pay off the entire 27k  loan. I am currently living at home and have always been a frugal person, so my monthly expenses are minimal.
 
Firstmark- 
When I was born, my parents invested money into some mutual funds for me to use when I grew older (ta-dah!). I am not well-versed at all in the language of mutual funds, but I do know that I have enough money (and my parents' blessing/encouragement) in those funds that I can pay off the whole 36k for the Firstmark loan.

So...
Is there a downside to using the mutual funds to pay off my loans? 
Are there holes in my plans that I'm not seeing?

Also, I have no plans to buy a house when I move out (looking to live in a condo)., if that makes a difference in any of this.

personalfinance,"I'm a trans woman who won a sweepstakes (50k Scholarship or 25k Cash). Would like to know how to maximize effect of this to help pay for transition-related surgeries, and have your input on what I should otherwise do with the winnings.","Hello /r/personalfinance!

I am a 25 year old transwoman who is a medical school student. Recently, (just this evening, as a matter of fact,) I received a notification from a sweepstakes that I previously hadn't thought twice about that I was one of the ""Grand Prize"" winners. 

* ""Up to 50k student debt forgiveness for eligible debt incurred from an accredited postsecondary educational institution...""
* ""Up to 50k scholarship to an accredited postecondary educational institution...""
* Or $25k cash. (Approximately $18,500 after federal taxes--there are no state income taxes where I live).

(Note: the $50k would only cover tuition, fees, books, supplies, and ""necessary equipment,"" which at my medical school would cover 2 years of tuition. I would still be receiving ~$24k in living expenses--Rent, food, bills, maintaining my car, etc.)

My initial gut reaction was to take the $25k cash. I do not have any student loan debt from undergrad due to a full-ride scholarship I had, and my (naive) gut reasoning for not taking the $50k in scholarship is that with my future career prospects, the issue of medical school debt is not one of feasibility, but one of time. (i.e. I ""know"" I'll be able to pay it off in the future.)

After I ran through my mental list of essentially disposable things I could spend the money on, I realized that such a windfall would be able to pay for my GCS (Gender Confirmation Surgery), something that I didn't think I would be able to afford (much less fit into my schedule) until I finished residency. I would be able to take a year off of school to have my surgery, recover, and would be able to do research during this time frame since being up on my feet for clinical rotations would be out of the picture.

As I think more about this, I'm wondering how I could find a way to take the $50k option and somehow be able to use that to pay for additional surgeries--on my list is facial feminization surgery and breast augmentation. From having had a full-ride scholarship in undergrad, I admittedly do not know much about the process of how scholarships affect my federal loan disbursement. Sometime in the past I think I have heard that whatever scholarships you receive essentially displace what you would receive in federal loans--in essence ""transferring"" the extra money that would have been applied to tuition/fees into the living expenses disbursement. I don't know how accurate this is, however.

So--all of that to say: How can I get the maximum amount of money from these winnings? Would I be better off taking the cash, and perhaps paying for one out of my three desired surgeries, or would the complicated (and still unknown to me) logistics of taking a scholarship and figuring out how to turn that into cash I can use be worth it? 

I already know it would be more ""prudent"" to take the larger sum and have less debt to pay off in the future, but having previously accepted the fact that I will have a buttload of medical school debt, and that I will be able to pay for it in the future... I'm not worried about that aspect.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to offer their input.

(If this is the wrong place to ask such a question, please point me to the correct subreddit! Thank you.)

personalfinance,"25/yo with a question about renting vs. buying in the Bay Area. Somewhat unique situation in mind, details inside...critique my reasoning!","I’m a 25-year-old guy living in the Bay Area. After four years of living at home and working full time I have $154,000 saved. If I put it down as a 20% down payment I can afford a maximum $770,000 four bedroom, single family home. The location I am looking at is Oakland, CA if that matters.

If I bought that house, property taxes + insurance add about $10,800/year. With a 4.2% interest rate (maybe optimistic?) my monthly mortgage would be about $36,000/year. My plan is to get three roommates who each pay me ~$1300/month rent (normal for the Bay Area :/ ). I would be able to cover all of my monthly costs just through the rental income and effectively live for free.

But that rent is taxable--here’s where it gets interesting. I would first be eligible for all the normal property deductions. Furthermore, since the place would be 3/4 a rental, I could depreciate 3/4 the value of property and deduct that, plus 3/4 of the minor improvements + appliances to prepare it to rent. All told, I can deduct almost as much as the value of rental income I will be taking in. I will also be eligible for a $2000 MCC tax credit.

Taking all of the above into account, the net effect on my finances is that I would be saving around $11,000 each year owning instead of renting. I recognize most of that would probably go back into house upkeep, but that would be 3/4 deductible, too.

Meanwhile, I would be sitting on an asset that would (hopefully) be appreciating. Oakland is catching up to SF in priciness but is still in the process of gentrifying. My plan is to live in this house in the situation I’ve described for at least five years.

The biggest danger I’m aware of is if real estate value in the area decline, though there may be other dangers I am not seeing. What do all of you think of the reasoning I’ve outlined above? So far it seems like buying is the more intelligent option, but I am not dead set on it yet. Am I missing anything? Wrong on any basic assumptions or tax rules? Additional thoughts?

Any help would be so, so appreciated on this huge decision! :)",finance,1479288595

personalfinance,19 F Unexpectedly has to pay for college,"Hi PF, this is my first post to reddit so if I'm not doing this right I apologize! I'm a 19 year old college student who is pretty much lost. 

Backstory: I graduated high school in 2015 and went out of state for my freshman year of college last year. My parents agreed to cosign my student loans so like any normal college student I expected to be in school for four years, graduate with four years of loans on my back, and look for a job. 

To make a long story short, when I came home in May, my parents told me that they were getting divorced and that as a result/punishment/whatever, my dad would not sign any more loans for me. At the time my mom was unemployed so she had no income to show as a cosigner, and I applied for loans on my own but wasn't approved because of the amount I needed. I've been working full time since then but due to car issues I've only been about to save about $2k. I'm enrolled in community college courses for the upcoming spring and summer semesters so that I can start to get back on track, but this is where my issue comes in. My grandma is pretty well off and while she doesn't feel comfortable paying outright for me to go back to school, she's willing to cosign my loans. My mom won't let her. She's convinced that I'm going to fail out of school and default on my loans. 

TLDR: dad is too dumb to sign a loan, mom doesn't trust me enough to sign a loan, grandma is more than willing to sign a loan but mom won't let her. 

Any advice? By the time the summer rolls around I'll have spent all of my savings paying for community college, and working full time will be tough while I go back to school. I know it can be done- just looking for any advice at all.

My wife and I are well aware that ignorant, stupid decisions have been made, but we're ready to stare this problem in the face and take action. I'd appreciate solid advice and not a bunch of financial shaming. We get it, we fucked up. Bad.

**Here's the important info (let me know if I'm missing anything)...**

* Wife has $40-50k in federal student loans - all government backed. *(Might be closer to 29k. See edit below)*
* All loans are in default and have been for 6-7 years without a single payment being made. (So stupid, I know.)
* Wife doesn't know exactly how many loans she has nor does she know the exact balance.
* All loans were under her name only (we weren't married at the time) and were taken out between 2004-2009

**Questions for PF:**

1. How can we find out exactly how many loans she has, and the balance of each?

2. How do we go about starting to make payments? I'm pretty sure all of these loans have been sent to collections, but since they're government backed loans I'm not sure how that works.

3. Is there any hope at all for negotiating a settlement? Or does the fact that these are government backed give us no hope here?

4. Speaking of collections, my wife used to receive annoying phone calls regularly from collection agencies, but since we were married 2 years ago they've mostly stopped. Maybe it's related to her changing her last name after marriage? Not sure, but obviously we want to avoid waking a sleeping monster if at all possible. Any tips are appreciated.

PF, your advice and help are desperately needed here. I don't even know where to begin. I look forward to your wise words!

Edit 1: Formatting.

Edit 2: After running her credit report, I see 7 open accounts with ""US DEPARTMENT OF ED"" totaling a little over $29k. Is it possible I'm missing something here?

""you are born in Clovis?? cool...Buddy was a great influence on a lot of bands, Beatles &amp; even Lemmy

investments, there are always good ones or better ones

go to Scottrade &amp; open an account, even when you are in cash they give you interest

https://www.scottrade.com/

suppose you have $10,000, that is $10K, K means thousand

the best interest you get in a bank here in 1.5% if you get a CD for a 5 year term

you know the official govt. inflation rate is 2% a year, &amp; actually that is understated, meaning really inflation is higher...you know what is inflation?? your money buys LESS than before because prices rise...so in those 5 years, your money has gained 1.5% interest, while it has devalued 10% or more...&amp; on the 1.5% they give you, you have to put it into your taxable income...do you know what that is called?? robbery...it's official theft by the federal govt....

so first off, pay off ALL your debts...being in debt makes you a slave...then save up $5K...that is a good way to start investing...

a safe investment is to buy a mutual fund, there are many, a fund is a group of stocks that some smart guy who is called a fund manager has put together...how do you pick a fund?? by it's performance...some people have a social conscience, they want to invest in something they believe in, &amp; not in some other thing they don't like...you know what I believe in &amp; I like?? what makes the best return...

&amp; it should be safe, Morning Star gives a rating on funds, 5 star means it's the safest &amp; least likely to drop like hell...if a fund did well over the last 5 years, that will probably continue...that is called momentum...

so go to a different broker, go to Fidelity Investments...they are good for mutual funds, they have some health science ones that are good...like FBIOX...see this...

https://www.fidelity.com/

go to investment products - mutual funds...Morning Star highly rated...

https://www.fidelity.com/fund-screener/evaluator.shtml#!&amp;ntf=Y&amp;expand=%24MorningstarRatings&amp;msr=4%2C5

at the top of the list is FBIOX, 12.9% return since Jan. 1st, 2015, not bad...click on it...

https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316390772

see Hypothetical Growth, if you put $10K in FBIOX 10 years ago, today it's worth $56K, not bad...if you can find a better one, buy it...

the minimum to buy this fund is $2,500 &amp; there are no fees...Fidelity put the fund together, you could buy it thru another broker but then there is some cost...if you want to buy a Fidelity fund, you buy it from Fidelity...Scottrade is good for stock trading, their fees are lower...

suppose you get bored with a mutual fund (coz once you but it, ther ei nothign to do but watch it grow LOL)...you can buy a leveraged ETF...for example, you know the Standard &amp; Poor 500...S&amp;P500...it is 500 stocks that Mr. S &amp; Mr. P selected that demonstrate the health of the American economy...they go up &amp; down as a group, do you want to be diverse &amp; buy them all?? so one is down &amp; the other is up?? &amp; they are hitting record highs every week now?? sure, you can buy an ETF that is based on this index...there are TWO, both are leveraged...UPRO goes up 3% when S&amp;P goes up 1%...that's nice...3 x the gain...&amp; then there is SPXU, it is inverse ETF, it goes UP 3% when S&amp;P goes DOWN 1%...how do they do it?? I have no fucking idea...but I don't care...so when S&amp;P is rising, you buy UPRO, then when you think it has gone as high as it can, you sell it...then you buy SPXU &amp; when S&amp;P drops, you also gain...GREAT, like riding 2 elevators...but you have to buy enough
 of it to have a decent gain, because each trade costs you $7...so you have to gain more than that when you sell, of course...or you could very simple buy UPRO &amp; hold it...in the last year, S&amp;P is +12%, UPRO is +40%, go to Yahoo Finance &amp; see it for yourself...if you just did nothing more than buy UPRO &amp; hold it, you have a 40% gain...&amp; until you sell it, you have an Unrealized Gain, so no taxes...only when you SELL do you pay the taxes...the broker sends you a 1099 tax form, they report to IRS &amp; you put it into your 1040 following the instructions, very simple...

do you have $10K to invest?? put half in FBIOX &amp; the other half in UPRO...learn the market while you sit on the money &amp; make 40%...then start to trade between UPRO &amp; SPXU &amp; maybe you can double your money in a year...does this beat 1.5% return in 5 years?? fuck yeah...

I just gave you $1,000 dollars worth of free advice...

why does the govt. prop up the market?? because the average person sees the news, when he sees that the market is UP, he thinks the entire economy is good, so he votes for the incumbant politicians, &amp; those guys keep their jobs...when the economy sucks, people vote to kick out the incumbant politician, so that politician will use all his power to make things look good so he keeps his job...

&amp; also, when people are making profits in the stock market, they pay more taxes so the IRS gets more money in...

I am planning to attend a local university (California State University, Northridge) this coming fall for my Evening MBA.

 I have opted out of attending ""top"" programs due to my opinion that the cost will outweigh the overall benefits.

With that said, the program is looking like it's going to cost about $30,000 for the two years including tuition and books. I can get away with no loans if I deplete my cash savings and put a good chunk of my monthly income into my tuition. A second option would be to take out a few small federal loans, and pay these back over time - I would assume this would be interest free for at least 6 months post graduation.

I am just recently graduated, am 25, work full time at $13.75 per hour, have $1,500 in my Roth IRA ($100 per month contributions), and have $500 in my 401k (100 per month contributions). While my cash savings are split into various envelope style funds - I only have about $13,000. 

I currently have zero debt, and after my monthly expenses (rent, food, car insurance, leisure..etc) I usually am stashing an additional $500 into these various envelope style funds (emergency, future mortgage...etc).

In addition, my work will contribute $2,500 per year if I am willing to sign a 2 year work contract. I am still deciding if this is worth tying myself up.

I would love advice from any and all of you, and I will gladly provide any more information if need be.

personalfinance,Considering selling my house and moving to an apartment closer to work. Does it make sense from a finance perspective?,"Background - I currently live a 30 minute, 22 mile drive from work, in an area of a town that I don't really care to remain in. I bought the house 9 1/2 years ago, when I was 21. It was cheap, I got a 30 year mortgage, but paid 0 down, which means I've had PMI in my payment for the entire time. I will be reaching 20% LTV in May of 2017, at which point I can request cancellation of the PMI.

My current payment is $381/mo, with taxes escrowed and $37/mo of PMI included. Interest rate on the mortgage is 5.75%, but since the amount is so low, mortgage interest doesn't ""help"" me on my taxes at all, and I still take the standard deduction.

Due to some poor decisions and a few years of heavy drinking, I have a good amount of debt that I have been working to chip away at for the last 2 years. Those payments leave me with less cash at the end of every month than someone with such a low mortgage payment ""should"" have.

Back to the housing change... The town and specific section that I live in is pretty rough. Lots of drugs around and the crime that comes with it. I generally keep to myself and don't bother anyone, and as such have not yet been a victim of any crime myself. But it's the kind of place where you don't walk around after dark if you can help it.

The area I'd like to move to is much closer to work... maybe 5 miles. The houses are nicer, further from each other, it's a rural area, and I feel that it would be much better for my mental health to move back into the country air. However, housing is also more expensive. For a 1200 sq ft apartment in a farm house, it's $700/mo. If I want a full house, it's going to be $1000-1200/mo, which I don't think is feasible with my income and current debt payments.

The logistical part of me says I should stay in my current house until I get some more of my debt paid off and can more comfortably afford a higher payment. The other part of me says I'd be much happier living in a different area, it would save me 50 minutes in my car every day, and if I was forced to cut back on spending to make my housing payment, it would just lead to me not spending extra money on crap like eating at restaurants (which should already be going to my debt payment but isn't).

Please, however, do not send me emails about how I am just a kid or how I haven't taken a Series 7 exam.

I hate to feed into this stereotype and reference The Big Short, but among the guys that predicted the housing bubble in 2007 were a medical doctor and two kids in a garage. It doesn't take a rocket scientist if you read the articles.

I originally wrote this as a facebook post for my friends. Please excuse the entry-level explanations, we all know how the bond market works here, but I'm at work and don't really have time to modify it right now. This was also written last Thursday, treasuries have moved even higher still since then.

It is important to begin this breakdown with the notion that the stock market as you know it has been fraudulently inflated since 1982. The Reagan Administration, in their ever-prescient wisdom, enacted SEC Rule 10b-18, creating a safe harbor whereby corporations could buy back their own stocks. This effectively legalized price manipulation, but worry not! They set a limit on the amount of money these firms could spend… at 25% of the average daily trading volume PER DAY. This rule overrode the anti-fraud measures enacted in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and set the market off on the 34-year bull run that people love to cite when they say that the market is “doing just fine.” The chairwoman of the SEC has admitted that they aren’t even monitoring this rule, but that is beside the point, as it is a ridiculous rule to begin with. Long story short, the record setting DJIA quotes that we constantly see are no more than a product of price manipulation and financial engineering.

Here are a few facts:

1) Stock buybacks have accounted for a little over one fifth of the buildup of S&amp;P 500 market capitalization since the 2009 crash. ([source](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-stock-buybacks-have-become-wall-streets-new-drug-2015-07-17))

2) In 2015Q1, firms’ shareholder cash distributions (buybacks + dividend payments) exceeded their net income for the first time in a non-recession year EVER. ([source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-26/s-p-500-spending-on-buybacks-dividends-exceeds-operating-profit))

3) While companies are sitting on record-setting cash piles, they have been issuing bonds to borrow money to finance these distributions, since they cannot repatriate the money they have hidden in offshore tax havens. ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/30/with-all-of-apples-cash-why-is-it-issuing-bonds/))

It is that third point where President-Elect Donald J. Trump becomes relevant. His proposed tax plan would create a $6.2 trillion budget shortfall over the first ten years it was enacted according to the Tax Policy Center ([source](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan)). To cover this shortfall, as the government does when public revenues do not meet public expenditures, there will need to be a bond issuance and increase in national debt. This is just the baseline, and does not account for increases in expenditure to repair infrastructure as he spoke about in his victory speech, nor does it include expenditures on “the wall” that Mexico said on Tuesday that they will not be paying for. That already high number is only likely to increase.

This is where economics come into play. When the US government issues bonds, they increase the supply of bonds available for purchase in the marketplace. As with any “good” (a term loosely applied to a financial instrument here), the mechanics of supply and demand dictate that the price of US treasury bonds will fall as their supply increases under constant demand. Because of the way that bond yields are computed, this will drive up the interest rate that US treasuries pay out. For those of you that don’t know, the interest rate paid out by a US treasury bond is referred to as the “risk-free” rate of interest, and it is the rate on which other interest rates are based. This is a fundamental rule of economics and of the credit market. An increase in the risk-free rate will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the ultra-low rates that firms have been borrowing at since 2007 when the Federal Reserve Bank instituted their near-zero interest rate policy. When the cheap credit dries up, it will no longer be economically viable for firms to leverage buybacks on bond issues.

The rising interest rates have an added effect of decreasing demand for stocks. As investors are enticed to flock into treasuries and other bonds for their new, higher yield, their demand for equity investments will fall. This means that the companies that were already accounting for almost 20% of the trading volume on the NYSE by dollar amount will have to spend even MORE money on buying back their own stocks to continue to perpetuate the massive fraud that has been going on since before most of us were born. This increased demand for debt will lead them to issue more bonds which, as we discussed earlier, will only serve to push the interest rate even higher and make the system more unsustainable. When firms cannot efficiently borrow money to finance their price manipulation operations, and a fifth of the demand for equities rapidly disappears, the stock market as we know it will fall apart.

This is why I am scared of Donald Trump. Not because he is a racist, not because he is a misogynist, and not because he has outstanding allegations of child rape and fraud against him. It is his hubris and ignorance to the fundamental laws that govern the functioning of our financial markets (despite his claims to be a “terrific” business man) that scares me the most. You can deport anybody you want, grab whoever’s pussy you want to grab, and rail against any faith you choose, but you cannot implement such a drastic tax proposal and such grandiose public expenditures without collapsing the United States’ (and thus that of most of the world, by ripple effect) equity market.

If you made it this far, congratulations! Now it’s time to answer a few questions that some confused people have been asking me lately.

1) If Donald Trump is so bad for the economy, why is the Dow Jones up? Well friend, I’m sorry to burst your bubble but the DJIA is not the only indicator of a robust and healthy economy. I think this is a result of firms getting in as many buybacks as they can before rates go up, but I could be wrong on that. Take a look at the yield on a 10-year US treasury bond, which is up over 25 basis points from its pre-election level. This means that a lot of smart people who manage a lot of money are scared of what rates will look like in the future, and are selling off their bond holdings. The futures market (a more complicated system that I don’t have time to explain right now without typing an entire other diatribe just like this) for treasuries looks even more grim, down almost 2% since the election.

2) What other impacts could this have outside of the stock market? If you have an adjustable rate mortgage or student loan, now is the time to refinance. Check your cardmember agreements for credit cards, and any auto finance agreements you may have as well.

3) Why didn’t you say anything before the election? I knew this bubble was inflating for a long time, but foresaw it bursting in 2018 when the rest of the market believed that the FRB would hike interest rates. I (along with most other economists) did not foresee what a massive and expedient impact that electing Donald Trump would have on rates, nor was the likelihood of a Trump presidency believed to be that high.

Was pre-qualified for a two-family up to $750k with a $200k down payment. Ever since the election, the interest rates have been rising and housing rates are pretty high right now as well. Based on that I'm leaning towards waiting a while and seeing what happens.  

I also currently have a mortgage on another property in another state that I'm renting out. The rent I pay to live in New York is covered by this rental income. I still owe $212k on this property and at the current rate I'm paying it down ($2.5k/month) it'll be paid off in just under 9 years with about $28k in interest. If I were to pay the minimum due ($1.2k/month) it'll be paid off in 20 years with about $76k in interest. It's an ARM so these are based on the current rate.  

Since I'm leaning towards waiting, I'm left with the decision on what to do with my $200k down payment. I could invest it, put it in an interest bearing account...or I could leverage it to have my current mortgage paid off within 6 months (Or right now...have about $125k in investments besides the down payment). Once that is paid off my take-home instantly goes up by the $2.5kish per month that I'm currently putting towards that mortgage and stop paying interest. According to a couple sites, my property is currently worth around $310k-$350k which I could take a HELOC against for a down payment. Would this be a good idea at all?

Here is my situation. 26 Years old. 65k federal student loans maxed out and I still need 30 credits to graduate. Undergrad in chemistry. No family to cosign for private loans. Credit score 680. I'm not sure whether to get private loans because going more in debt sounds like a bad idea when entry level jobs in my field pay $12-15/hour. 

Total expenses every month (I don't go out or waste money on stupid shit like booze, i have no social life whatsoever):
rent 550
utilities 100

car maintenance (oil changes) 35
personal hygene (medications, soap, contants) 30
misc (clothing from goodwill, housewares) 30
TOTAL 1515/month
or 18180/year

Income: I drive Uber and make about 450/week working about 40 hours a week outside of school mostly on the weekends. Total income 1800 on a good month. Thats 21600/ year. Just enough to not qualify for medicaid but not enough to buy my own health insurance. 

21600-18180 = 3420 possible savings per year assuming I don't have any medical bills or my car doesn't need breaks and tired and shit like that. Realistically there are other unforeseen expenses so I am able to save about 3000 a year. 

65k in student loans / (3k if I use my entire savings) = 22 years approximately before I can pay it off. But with interest accruing at 2k per year that means only 1k of my savings per year actually goes towards the principle so it will take 65 years to pay off my loan??? 

Obviously the solution is, get a better job or eliminate expenses....

SO I've had my resume professionally looked at and applied for somewhere about 40 jobs in the past month or so. I've got a few interviews and a couple of offers but most of these jobs that only require a highschool diploma pay less than what I make driving uber. Those that don't, do not offer benefits so after I buy my own health insurance every month I'm only making like 300 more dollars a month for the same amount of hours. I have an offer to drive for a fedex contractor where I'll make 650 a week after taxes with no benefits for 40 hours a week. Thats 31200/year

If I take this job 31200-18180 = 13020 potential savings per year, realistically about 12k a year after unforeseen expenses. Of course that's not factoring in health insurance costs and assuming I contribute 0 to any kind of savings. So 65k/12k = 6 years if only principle, 7 or 8 considering the interest. This looks a little better but Ill be almost 35 by the time I get out of debt with absolutely no savings whatsoever best case scenario. 

So some questions.... 

Do I save money in a roth IRA or some other savings account while making the minimum payments on my loans, or do I not save anything and use all my money to pay off the loans as fast as possible?

What should I do about my work situation? What kinds of jobs can I get that pay more money that I don't need a degree for?

stocks,The difference between this year's rate hike and last.,"Assuming Yellen pulls the trigger next month we can assume a market movement.  However, there's some key differences between this year and last year. 

Primarily, Wall Street is ready.  The hike is already 90% priced into the market anyway.  Not raising may even spur a bubble and cause next summer to rival the 2014 taper tantrum. 

Next, with oil rising and trump in office it's healthy to do a little inflation prevention.  

Also, with so much uncertainty about future relations with china and the Middle East (and even Mexico and Canada for that matter) it's a good idea for the Feds to give themselves so slack to play with in the event of a global shock.  

With that said, I don't think the market will dip as far as it did last year if they hike.  In fact, since Wall Street likes certainty so much we could see equity prices steadily rise through the hike.

I will be moving into an apartment close to my university in January for $340/month with all utilities included. I currently make $12.50/hour working 25-28 hours per week, although I will be getting another job once this semester ends.

Here are my monthly expenses:

Car + Insurance: $300

Cell phone: $33-50/month

Dry cleaning: $20

Groceries: $200

Gas: $60

I know my 2010 Honda Accord is fully up-to-date with maintenance, so I won't need to worry about it for a while. Despite my hourly wage, I get paid on all federal holidays and get vision and accident insurance through my work. I will be asking for more hours at my current job, and if I can't get more, then I can go to my previous job and at least try to get some extra hours there, as I am on very good terms with my former employers.

personalfinance,Need help with student loan repayment options,"Hello everyone! I am a recent law school grad who is trying to decide what student loan repayment plan will work the best for me going forward. 

The financial information:

- The DEBT: approximately $190k in student loan debt (all federal loans)

- The INTEREST RATE: 5.89% with the .25% bump for setting up auto pay.

- the INCOME: I didn't want a biglaw job and instead opted to go to a smaller firm. I get to go home at 5:30 and enjoy my life, but I make much less --&gt; **$75k salary** (bonuses at $50/hour for all hours billed over 130 per month). We can assume I will not be making much more than the base $75k my first year.

- It is probably safe to assume 5% annual increases per year. I will actually likely jump more than that in the first few years, but then it will probably slow down.

**Under the Extended Fixed payment plan**, I will be making payments of $1,218 for 25 years, ultimately paying about $370k to be free of debt. I can afford this, but it is tight.

- If I paid $1,380 I could be out of debt in 20 years and pay a total of about $330k.

**Under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan**, my payments would be capped at 10% of my discretionary income. My wife and I probably have a combined pre-tax income of about $85-90k.

- From what I can see, starting here and estimating income growth at 5% annually, I would end up paying about $220-240k over 20 years. After 20 years of payment any remaining balance would be forgiven and treated as taxable income. The total amount forgiven likely would be $120k-150k. Assuming I am being taxed at 33% at that point on that income (I know I can't predict exactly what the tax rate will be in 20 years), I would have a tax liability in the range of $40-50k.

- To me, PAYE looks like it ultimately results in savings, as my total amount paid over the 20 years plus the tax liability on the forgiveness ($240k + $50k = $290k) is still less than what I would end up paying if I actually just made the payments necessary to pay off the full loan amount in 20 years ($330k).

My problem is that this seems like it must be too good to be true. Whenever I see something that could somehow result in a financial boon to me, I assume it is actually a trick and someone is gonna whack me in some way I didn't foresee.

So please, can people weigh in on the pros/cons here? Am I missing something that would make PAYE less beneficial?

I know that if my income were to increase too drastically the result could potentially be my payments going up to a maximum of what they would be on a 10 year pay off plan, roughly $2,100. In that case I would end up paying more because I would have to pay off the full amount owed, which would include capitalized interest I built as the result of negative amortization while on the PAYE plan.

However, my income would have to get pretty high for that to happen.

Right now it looks like the smartest plan for me is to get myself on the PAYE plan and start saving a small amount ($200-300/month) so that I have the money to pay off the tax liability of my eventual loan forgiveness. It appears that by doing this I could actually pay anywhere form $30-80k less over the life of my loans.

The thing that scares me about PAYE is that it varies based on factors like income and family size and things like changes in income tax rates can impact the end result.

So please people, poke holes and tell me how I am wrong in thinking that PAYE is actually the financially superior option.",finance,1479352004

personalfinance,"Question about debt verification and ""collections"" agency","Hi r/personalfinance

So in August I moved out of my old apartment complex and into a new one. When I left the apartment I checked out with the front office and was not informed of any outstanding balances on my account.

Fast forward to October and I receive a call from Hunter Warfield  a debt collection service saying that I owed $750 with the approximate breakdown of $125 for unpaid rent, $150 for unpaid rent late fee, and $475 for damages to the apartment. I requested an itemized list of all the things I owe broken down, and I received a letter from Hunter Warfield stating that they received my request for verification of debt, and that they need more time to gather the info I requested.

Ihave no problem paying what I owe the complex. However, I have proof showing that I paid the $125 in ""extra rent"" for the few days past the end of my lease that my 60 days notice left me. I am also concerned that the ""damage"" they are charging me for is for ""damage"" that was in the apartment when I moved in. I have dated pictures showing the damage that was in the apartment when I moved in, along with work orders I put in to fix it and other issues that were there. There's also the matter of a $150 security deposit that I never received back.

How should I deal with this? I'm a bit miffed that the old complex didn't contact me at all before sending the debt to collections. Nothing is showing on my credit report yet but I would like to keep it that way.

What I really want to know is should I take all of my evidence in to the apartment complex and try and discuss this with a manager? Or should I package all this information together to send it to Hunter Warfield? How long should I wait for the verification of debt to come from Hunter Warfield and should I try and contact them again at all?

Again I do want to pay what I owe the complex, but I don't want to pay for anything that I didn't do or already paid for.

(2) Should ViaBTC open-source their private relay network software? (3) Which is more anti-fragile: a ViaBTC/BU future, or a Core/SegWit future?","Some of these issues were raised briefly in today's AMA with Haipo Yang, founder and CEO of ViaBTC:

**Mining vs non-mining nodes**

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5ddiqw/im_haipo_yang_founder_and_ceo_of_viabtc_ask_me/da3wszm/

&gt; What do you think of the influence of non-mining node operators under Bitcoin Unlimited's model for voting on maximum block size? Do you think that non-mining nodes signaling for a certain size would truly motivate miners to not exceed that size?

~ u/ChronosCrypto (Bitcoin Vlogger)

&gt; I believe that with the Bitcoin Unlimited method, the influence of non-mining nodes on the block size is very limited.

~ u/ViaBTC

---

**ViaBTC's closed-source relay network**

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5ddiqw/im_haipo_yang_founder_and_ceo_of_viabtc_ask_me/da3uvpv/

&gt; Are you using the Bitcoin FIBRE relay network bitcoinfibre.org?

~ u/core_negotiator (Note: This person is not a ""Core negotiator"". There is no such thing.)

&gt; No, we use our own system [which was] developed by myself. It is much better.

~ u/ViaBTC

&gt; [Have you] Thought about having that incorporated into BU (even giving access to BU miners)? I ask because looking at some of your pool's first-job times, it looks your system is quite impressive and it'd be a massive slap in the face for core's RN et al

~ u/ViaBTC

~ u/messiano84

&gt; haha so when will you open source it? 

~ u/yeh-nah-yeh

---

**Should we be concerned that ViaBTC will have a lot of hashing power - and they will be using a private, close-source relay network?**

There is probably a lot of discussion we could have on this topic.

I like ViaBTC - but it seems strange that he did not address this point very much in his AMA.

Are we going to have to ""trust ViaBTC"" now and ""trust"" their closed-source private relay network software?

This seems like this would be a point of centralization / vulnerability in the network - where ViaBTC could abuse his power, or other players could attack ViaBTC, and harm Bitcoin itself.

---

**How does BU ""signaling"" work - in a non-mining (fully-validating) node, vs a mining node.**

One question quoted above from the AMA was:

&gt; [Do you think that non-mining nodes **signaling for** a certain size would truly motivate miners to not exceed that size?](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5ddiqw/im_haipo_yang_founder_and_ceo_of_viabtc_ask_me/da3wszm/)

I understand there are multiple parameters involved in ""signaling"":

- EB = excessive blocksize

- AD = acceptance depth 

(Are there other parameters too? I can't remember.)

Here is a Medium post by ViaBTC where he proposes some strategies for setting these parameters, in order to safely hard fork to bigger blocks with BU:

Miner Guide: How to Safely Hard Fork to Bitcoin Unlimited

https://medium.com/@ViaBTC/miner-guide-how-to-safely-hard-fork-to-bitcoin-unlimited-8ac1570dc1a8#.akijaiba7

Could we have some more discussion on how ""signaling for"" blocksizes works - under various possible future scenarios (optimistic / pessimistic... likely / unlikely / black-swan)?

---

There are various future scenarios (*after* the network has eventually / presumably forked from Core to BU) where people could use BU's parameters to realize certain results on the network.

(1) What are some of those future scenarios?

- economic / political / technical events which could abruptly affect Bitcoin network traffic

  - already: Chinese currency (Yuan) dropping against US currency (dollar)
  
  - already: India demonetizing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes
  
  - likely: major ETF getting approved in the US (Winklevoss or other) 
   
  - possible: additional spam attacks on the Bitcoin network 
  
    - ...from white hats (testing the system; pointing out vulnerabilities; making a statement)
    
    - ...from black hats (another coin; a bot-net; pro-Core and/or anti-BU users; state / corporate actors; Mircea Popescu?)
  
  - black swan: some government does something weird &amp; unexpected impacting financial markets and/or Bitcoin
  
    - ... Trump administration : some high-level person (who's actually just an alt-right blogger that Trump hired to run some major governnent department) makes some crazy pronouncement / ruling about the internet / about the markets (FCC eliminates network neutrality? T-Bill sale fails?)
    
    - ... Fed : rate hike? more helicopter money?
    
    - ... Europe : Deutsche Bank collapses? Merkel / ECB decides to rescue / not rescue them? bail-ins?
    
    - ... China : China bans Bitcoin again? releases their own crypto? imposes new capital controls? Bitcoin price goes moon and CNY crashes so Chinese govt imposes emergency ban on all traffic across Great Firewall - cutting off 80% of mining from the West?
    
    - ... Russian hackers? some 400 pound guy on his bed? 4chan? whoever took down a big chunk of the DNS a few weeks ago?

(2) What are some possible (typical, atypical... benevolent, malicious... altruistic, selfish... defensive, proactive... pessimistic, optimistic ) **BU parameter-setting strategies** which people might adopt in those scenarios?

- Which software is more safe / more dangerous... more anti-fragile / more fragile in the above scenarios?

  - *Core/SegWit* 1-1.7M blocksize (assuming wallet / exchange software gets upgraded for SegWit)?

  - users ""signaling for"" blocksize on the network using parameters in *Bitcoin Unlimited*?

(3) Can we start putting together a comprehensive strategic **""threat (and opportunity) assessment""** on those various possible future scenarios / strategies - ranking various threats (and opportunities) in terms of impact as well as probability?

- How would the network react to threats/opportunities using BU (with most mining still concentrated in China, and maybe also concetrated on ViaBTC's private closed-source relay network)? 

- How would the network react to threats/opportunities using Core/SegWit?

(4) A lot of the discussion about BU is among miners - mostly in China - and maybe later many miners will be using the ViaBTC pool - which is also offering a cloud mining option... so perhaps it is normal &amp; expected that *most* of the discussion about BU parameters revolves around *miners*.

- **What about non-mining (fully-validating) nodes in a BU world?** 

- What about SPV clients and servers in a BU world?

- Do *non-mining (fully-validating) nodes* **_also_** have some role to play in helping to set the blocksize, and helping to secure and grow the network, based on setting BU parameters? Or with BU, only the miners decide?

- Can non-mining (fully-validating) nodes *prevent* blocks from getting too big?

- How would SPV clients and servers work in a BU world? Can they actively participate in helping to decide blocksize?

(5) **Does BU give miners ""all the power""** - and so blocksize goes to 2 MB, 4 MB, 8 MB - and then some users from low-bandwidth geographic regions can no longer run full nodes at home?

(6) If we have *a period of 1-2 weeks* where ""bigger blocks"" get mined (eg, 2 MB, or 4 MB), and then we decide we don't like it, **can everyone ""signal for"" smaller blocks after a couple of weeks of bigger blocks?** Can the chain reverts to a smaller blocksize, after a brief, one-week ""bulge"" of bigger blocks?

(7) If we have *an isolated incident* where a *single* very-big block gets appended to the chain &amp; accepted to a sufficient depth (say, an 8 MB block or a 32 MB, that some miner somehow managed get accepted on the chain)

- **Can the chain revert to smaller blocks after an isolated incident of one very-big block?**

- Or are we ""stuck"" with that bigger blocksize forever, simply because one got mined in the past?

(8) Remember BitPay Adaptive Blocksize? One of the nice things about it was that its consensus-forming mechanism was based on taking a *median* of what people were signalling - and the *median* is a more robust statistic (harder to fake/sybil?). 

**Can any ideas from BitPay Adaptive Blocksize (eg, using the _median_) be incorporated into Bitcoin Unlimited?**

---

These are just some initial questions.

Other people probably have many more.

Hopefully we can have some good discussion and analysis, so we can keep the network safe &amp; growing.",cryptocurrency,1479390793

Bitcoin,New York Encounters Bitcoin Backlog,"New York has enforced digital currency companies doing business there to get a BitLicense to hold clients reserves and exchange crypto coins for dollars and other regular currencies since 2015.  The Department of Financial Services (DFS) was managed by Benjamin Lawsky when it developed those regulations, acting as an campaigner of virtual currencies when other regulators were still in doubt.  Even though it stays vague whether such currencies will ever gain dominant approval, they are now part of a broader, promptly-increasing business that combines finance and technology, and which leading financial centers are keen to draw attention.  For Corporations, a trademark of approval from a tough regulator cited a chance to win over clients who stayed reluctant about the product.  With New York, it was an opportunity to get ahead of rivals around the world that were also trying to charm fintech industries.

After the regulations came into charge, Lawsky quit the agency.  Few leading personnel with BitLicense expertise soon followed him.  DFS has released just two BitLicenses.  Another 15 operations are still pending, with four others retreated and four refused.  Two virtual currency companies have received trust charters, which treat them more like traditional financial institutions.  Patrick Murck, a lawyer and fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society, said ""by putting the managements together and having key staff members leaving almost thereafter, they really put the business behind the eight-ball in terms of competing with traditional service  providers"".  Nearly all firms that were operating in New York when the regulations took effect can still do business there while waiting for a license. However, start-ups may face trouble raising money or expanding their business.

The digital-currency business is very small compared to traditional finance, but it has grown rapidly since bitcoin's launch in 2009.  There are now other virtual currencies, and broader uses for underlying technologies that create and distribute them.  The bitcoin market is now worth about $10.7 billion, compared to less than $1 billion just three years ago, according to the information site CoinDesk.  Financial markets all over the globe have competed vigorously to entice new business, as the market has developed while some have depend on light-touch regulation, the appeal of New York's BitLicense was that it offered a clear permissible foundation.  Nevertheless, the slow licensing process and strict requirements are driving some companies away.  Application worth $5,000 to file, and once completed, can run 500 pages including everything from compliance manuals to executives' fingerprints. Regulators then drill deeper, asking for details of business models, organizational charts or ownership information.  Washington State, has issued seven licenses to virtual currency companies since 2013 under its longstanding law for money transfer industries.  North Carolina has licensed two.  A uniform virtual currency law that any state can opt into is also in the works, and there has been talk of a possible federal charter.

When getting quoted on a mortgage I had the option to put down a 1.25% deposit to lock in a 3.875% rate for 6 months (my current rate today is 3.5%) with the option of a one-time rate float down if rates are .125% lower than my locked rate. 

With the talk of rates rising, does it seem like a good idea to lock in the rate? It is slightly higher than market right now, but if the mortgage rates go up a significant amount in the next few months it'll still be a deal. 

The one thing keeping me from doing it is that if the house gets delayed ill be out the 1.25% deposit AND have to pay the higher interest rate when I close on the house.

* Spending money: $432  


I allocate $108 per week ($432/4) for food and extra expenses. Whatever is left over after the week goes into my savings, which is pretty low right now, only $2000. I’d been overspending my spending money because of unexpected purchases, so my savings have been pretty stagnant. I have no emergency fund, but I do live with my parents so they can help me if anything happens.   


Since assuming payment of my loans, I've been aggressively tackling my highest interest loan while making the minimum payments on the rest. I calculated that it will take about 6 years to pay everything off, assuming I get no help from my parents, I continue to live at home, and I maintain the same salary.  


Here is a breakdown of my student loans:  


* Private Loan A – $22,200 (8.625%)

* Private Loan B - $15,300 (6.35%)

* Private Loan C - $14,700 (5.995%)

* Federal Loan D - $10,100 (5.49%)

* Private Loan E - $27,422.11 (4.25%)


I'd also aim to start paying for my own auto insurance and phone bill within the next year, so that would be an added expense in the future. I'd eventually want to go to grad school in the next few years as well (but that's a problem for another day).


I have several concerns.


* **I want to move out in two years. Should I go for it or not?**

I know the smart thing to do would be to stay at home while I pay off my debt, but I don't want to be 30 and still sharing a room with my sister (because chances are, if I haven't moved out because of debt, she hasn't either tbh). I really want to embrace my 20s. 


My boyfriend and I have talked about moving in together, so I would have a roommate. Plus, I’d be closer to work since my commute is 1 hour 15 minutes, which would save on gas and car expenses.


I believe I’m good at my job, so I believe it's likely that my salary will go up if not this year then possibly next (which is something else I'll have to tackle entirely--asking for a raise).


Either way, I know that this would delay my payment plan, but I think it would be worth it for the freedom.


* **Should I consolidate my private loans? Would it be better to go with a separate company like Sofi or Earnest or go through one of the banks that my loans are under?**

From my research, consolidation seems like the best way to tackle enormous student loans. I can’t really see any reason not to, except that I wouldn't be able to tackle certain loans.


* **Should I hold back on aggressively paying off my loans to build an emergency fund/savings? Is there a difference between emergency fund and savings?**

I would be comfortable with at least $5,000 in savings. But I know that it’s wise to have at least 3 to 6 months’ worth of income in your savings/emergency fund.


**TLDR:** I have a 6 year plan to pay off $90k loans with a $42.5k salary. Is it wise if I move out? Should I consolidate? Should I build my pretty non-existent savings/emergency fund?


Any advice is very appreciated!

Sorry for the upcoming essay. I'm not sure what is superfluous to you being able to give me advice. I've bolded my actual question in the text in case you want to cut to the chase.

**My Info:**

I'm a 23 y/o with 10k in student loans in my name. However, I also have 150k in student loans in my parents name. I know it's a lot and this subreddit has reinforced that it was a bad idea. 

I've been following this subreddit's wiki since I got a full time job in 2015. I now have a 4 month emergency fund and paid off any 4+% interest rate student loans (25k) in my name. I will be paying off the remaining low interest 10k of student loans at the minimum amount required, and am on track to save 15% of my pre-tax income for retirement in the form of a 403b and a traditional IRA. 

**Parent's Info:**

I have started to pay my parents back, and am on track to pay them back over 7-11 years depending on my income growth. Their interest rate is 3.3% which was manageable until my dad had to take an earlier than expected retirement 10 months ago. They have retirement savings, but are struggling with that loan due to the unplanned retirement. They will begin pulling social security in 2 years at age 62 and lose the full benefit amount, so I'm trying to pay them back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I took out a 10 year life insurance policy so they get paid no matter what. 

**His Info:**

Now enter my bf. He's 30 and is in good financial form. I taught him what I learned on this subreddit, and he is completely student loan (his only loans) free as of this month, saving 24% for retirement (to catch up on the years he was saving under 15%), has a 6 month emergency fund, and we've set up a YNAB living expenses budget since we live together. Now that he's not using his extra income for loans he's starting to save for a house. 

We've been dating for 4 years, and he's been ready to get married for at least 3 of those years. Not that he's ever pressured me. I've told him no because I wanted to be settled into a full time job and help provide for us, get my finances up and running, and grow up a bit. I'm starting to think I'm ready for marriage and we've been talking about it more. This got us thinking about having to share finances, and here's my question:

**Once we get married, would it be better if he helped me aggressively pay down my student loans under my parents' name so that they lose less social security?**

**OR would it be better if he saved and paid for the house for 7-11 years by himself while I paid off my student loans? After I had done that I would jump in and help pay off the house.**

We aren't in a rush to get a house since we may not stay in the area for the next 5 years. Also, I've used some of the links this subreddit has provided to determine if we should be renting or homeowners, and it basically said we could go either way. Still, we could be saving for the down payment earlier than later.

What do you think?

Thanks reddit.",finance,1479406683

personalfinance,"[25] Have about $3,000 extra every month. Need help deciding investment vs debt payoff.","Hello PersonalFinance!  
  
I've read through quite a bit of OP's on this subreddit and have found that disclosing as much info as possible up front generally yields better advice. So here's my situation and the things I'm contemplating.  
  
25 Year Old living in LA working in the VFX industry making roughly $120,000 before taxes.  
Currently taking home roughly $6,800/mo after taxes. After my rent/utilities/minimum loan payment I have about $4,200 left. I currently give myself $1,000 every month for food/entertainment/hobbies, leaving $3,200 for savings.  
  
I currently have 3 months' worth of bare-minimum living expenses including food stashed away in a savings account that I haven't even activated the ATM card on so I can only touch it in emergencies.  I try my best to protect myself from my impulsive self.  
  
Given my current income I should have more stashed away, but I've only been working this job since July and before that was only making a 65k salary and barely scraping by after paying my loans.  
  
Now the bad part. I graduated two years ago from undergrad at a private school and currently have $82,000 outstanding private student loan debt with Navient (Sallie Mae's evil twin), meaning I don't ever apply for any kind of consolidation or anything like that. I have tried for the past month with several companies to get a private consolidation of my debt to get a interest rate, but none of them will do it because my credit score is terrible from the thing I want to refinance; my student loans. This is my only current debt.  
My first year of school was paid for with scholarships, but the other three years I had to take out massive loans. They are currently standing at the following:  
1. $31,295.80 @ 8.375%  
2. $32,263.18 @ 6.125%  
3. $18,725.19 @ 9.750%  
  
I just turned 25 this month and my goal is to pay off my student loans by 30 using the Avalanche method so I can purchase a home or condo in the lucratively expensive LA area by time I'm 35.  
  
However, I'm also in a rut because I don't have any sort of long-term savings started. I'm a freelancer with a steady long-term gig at a company here and I'm confident that I won't be be changing jobs any time soon, but I do not have access to an employer 401k or anything like that. I want to invest in an IRA to get myself started but I'm not sure if that's the smart move given my current debt.  
  
My loan interests rates are pretty high, but investing the maximum in an IRA would give me considerable ease when thinking about retirement.  

  
Given that I have roughly $38,200 extra money a year, my current idea is to max out $5,500/year in a traditional IRA and then throw the rest at my loans and I could most likely have them paid off by 30 at the latest.  
  
I've only really started educating myself on the consequences of debt and the benefits of investing in the past three months and have since become very serious about taking control of my finances and no longer living in the negatives.  
  
Does anyone have any advice for me?  
Should I forgo the (possibly volatile) investments for now until I have paid off my debt?  
Is there another strategy I have not considered?  
  
Thank you!",finance,1479407769

personalfinance,Is NOT buying a house a good financial decision?,"Hello all! I know less than Jon Snow, so I'm hoping you guys can give me some direction. I'm not sure if this is an appropriate post for this sub, so direct me to the right place if its not. This post might also be a bit long, since I'm not sure what info is or isn't relevant.

In March of this year I sat down and decided it was way passed time for me to grow up, start getting responsible with my money, and to set some goals. I had reached my one year anniversary at my job and was finally in a place where I could comfortably look to my future. My number one goal quickly became having a home of my own. I grew up in a military family, moving around a lot, so the feeling of ""home"" has always been something I wished I could have. However, my father always told me that renting was a waste of money, so I stayed living at home all this time and always assumed that home ownership would be what I would pursue when the time came to finally settle down somewhere. I opened a savings account and started making deposits so I could eventually have a decent down payment. I figured I could look seriously into buying my first home around the time I turned 25 or 26 (a year or two from now).

When I set this goal, I figured it would be a good idea to pay off my student loans before trying to save for a house, so I've been working on that. I started with a little under $10,000 in debt and have exactly $2000 left. My parents are going through a bit of a nasty divorce and my father moved states, so I've stayed with my mom and have been helping her pay for a lawyer. I've lent her $2350 out of my savings, which she will be able to pay me back by the end of the year. This money will go immediately towards paying off the rest of my student loans and back into savings. So essentially my student debt is gone (though, technically, not until after I've been repaid).

I also started this year with three credit cards. They are the cards you can apply for at retail stores, but can only use in their stores. I had gotten them about two years ago, but no longer used them. I canceled two of them, but kept one because I thought I might still use it in the future, but haven't really. It just lives in my wallet. Shortly after canceling the two cards I never used, I applied for and got two other credit cards that are like normal cards you can use everywhere. One is associated with my bank, where I have my savings account, and the other is through a different retail store that I shop at often, but doesn't have the ""you can only use it here"" restriction. I've had both cards about 7 or 8 months now. My credit score just broke into the excellent bracket, but I don't have a long credit history. Should I cancel the other card that I never use or keep it?

I get paid $19.68 per hour (I will be getting a small raise in about a month and another in March 2017, but I don't know how much either will be yet) and barring federal holidays when my work closes, I work 7 days a week. I also go in two hours early at least 2 days a week, but sometimes as much as 3 or 4 days a week. As it sounds, I get plenty of overtime, during which I get paid $29.52 per hour. Because my overtime hours can vary, my paychecks also vary a bit. My last one being ~$1740 and the one before that being ~$1650. My next check should be even higher since I've put in more overtime than normal this last week. When I work no overtime at all I usually make ~$1100, but I hate not working so I take all the overtime available.

10% of my paycheck (before taxes) automatically goes into a retirement fund that my job matches 5% of, but I know very little about this account other than it exists. I set up the 10% when I got hired because that seemed like a good even number and then never thought of it again. I don't know how much is in this account and am not entirely sure how to find out, how it works, anything about it, honestly.

In my savings account I have about $2450 that's just been sitting there for a few months. I opened the account, put money in, and have sporadically contributed to it since it opened.

My monthly bills are (rounded up):

Car Payment: $251 (about $10,000 left to pay on it. APR 1.9%)
Car Ins: $105
Cell Phone: $100
CCs: Pay them off (various amounts each month)

Anyways... I've reassessed what I want recently and realized I really am not too keen on buying a house. I was just sort of doing what I thought I was supposed to, I think? I'm not too passionate about the area I live in, at least not enough to commit to setting roots down for life. I might want to move closer to family in 5 or 6 years when my sister has a baby and don't think I want to go through the hassle of selling a house when/if that happens. With my budget the houses available to me are kind of awful, in awful areas, and would require thousands of dollars to get to a condition that I would be pleased with, which would take years. I will be living alone and don't like the idea of being solely responsible for repairs and renovations for the rest of my life.  

In general, even if I lived in a better place, close to family, and had a good quality house, I still don't like the idea of being bound to a mortgage for 30 years. Apartment life appeals to me, but I can't shake the feeling that its a bad decision financially. There is an apartment in the city that I love and I could afford it and still continue to put money into savings every month (although, admittedly, at a slower rate), but is it a waste of money? Is owning a house really better?

I guess I just want to hear from some people about their experiences owning a house or renting an apartment and what they would suggest. What are some unexpected things you had to shell out for in either situation? What would you caution against? Should I just suck it up and get a house? I realize in the long run I'd be paying more money to rent than if I just bought a house, but I almost think its worth it to avoid a mortgage, renovations, repairs, lawn work, property taxes, being unable to sell if I wanted to move.... Is that just short sighted? When I'm older and, hopefully, able to retire, is it a terrible idea to still be paying rent instead of living in a house I own? Or does it shake about even when you consider property taxes, life long repairs, and other expenses that come with owning a house?

1. Lower my tax liability from a personal/business expense.
2. Invest more towards retirement funds.

So I have a bachelor's degree in psychology (I know, bad choice), that I obtained about 7 years ago. Since then, I've had a few different jobs, and right now I work full time making about $15.50 hr. I live on my own, and with my student loans, i'm stressed to the max.

To make more money, I thought about going back to school part time for an in demand field (nursing). My employer will pay the majority of the cost, although to keep up with the program, I will probably have to drop to 30-35 hours a week (which is fine with my employer).

I have about 16,000 in federal loans, and 25,000 in private loans. My private loans are what destroyed this chance of happening. They have no in school deferment, and while I can go on an economic hardship forbearance for 1 year maximum, after that I have to pay about $208 a month. 

I can't afford that being in nursing school.

So.... to go from here: My only options I see are to try to move up at my job (which I don't like, but I have to suck it up to pay these things back) or try to find another job where I make more money (I've been looking, and my only option is another warehouse :/).

Here are my current expenses:
Rent: 790 a month (my lease is up next fall, I know I have to find cheaper rent)
Car insurance: $36 (no car payment)
Renter's Insurance: $13
Phone: $66 (my contract is up next fall, afterwards cheap prepayment plan)
Electric: $30-40 a month (heat, hot water included in rent)
Internet: $55 a month (including netflix)
Groceries: about $250 a month (can probably reduce this on rice and beans, cheaper cooking)
And my student loans: close to $400 a month

I bring home about $910-1000 every 2 weeks.

personalfinance,"[Auto] Soon to be grad, car just died, parent's signing loan vs. cosigning. Advice Appreciated!","Hello PF,  
  
My ~200k beater (purchased with a salvage title due to cosmetic damage) recently died. Luckily, my parents have a spare car they are letting me drive while I look at getting a new car. Right now I am paying 200$/mo to my dad. 100$ of which is going toward a down payment for a new car.  I'm graduating in May, and I think I want to buy either a lightly used Honda Civic or a new one. I am leaning toward buying a new one to take away the luck and guessing away from buying a used car. If I do buy a used one, I think it would be in the ~10k range which would still require me getting a loan.  

If I go new, I would be getting the cheapest model available. Manual Civic LX. I prefer manuals (both my previous cars were manuals) and I have heard that their average maintenance is lower. MSRP is $19,575. Honda has a $500 discount for soon to be grads/recent grads. This is applied toward the down payment. However, you have to be the primary owner/signer. I have good credit with a score of 737 when I checked ~2 weeks ago. However, I fear this may be inflated since my credit card has a ~2k limit and my income is pretty low since I work as a server.  I have worked out my budget for the next year, and I can afford the payments.  
  
Sorry for the long preface. My questions are  
1.  What is the difference between my dad cosigning the loan vs. the contract being in his name? I fear my  income is too small to get a good interest rate even though my credit is good. If the loan is in his name I lose $500, but a lower interest would make that back over the course of the loan.  
2.  Can you convince me to buy used instead? My thinking is that civics hold their value well. If I buy used, I'm likely going to spend ~8k for a car with 100k+ miles on it, or 13-14k for a car with ~30-70k miles on it.  The extra money is worth the warranty and not having unexpected issues arise. This way, I can also get exactly the model I want, manual, color, and base model with no costly frills.  
3.  Is a honda civic the best car to get? I want a compact, fuel efficient car. Specifically, I was looking at a vw jetta, mazda3, etc. [I made this excel spreadsheet to compare models.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxMxb986L37TcndXR0xDMlQyZWs/view?usp=sharing)

personalfinance,Pay off car loan early?,"Hey y'all,

I started full-time, post-college work in July. I make about $70k a year and live with my parents. I bought a car this summer with a 1.9% APR and a 60 month payoff plan. I am trying to figure out whether I should work to pay it off early.

I know 1.9% is a pretty low rate, but most of the money I am saving is going to an Ally account with a 1% interest rate (I am putting 15% of my salary toward my 401k and another 10% toward an Employee Stock Purchase Plan). 

I don't want to invest the money I am currently putting in Ally because it's possible I will want to buy a house for a few years and I don't want that money tied up (the impression I got is that if you invest in a Vanguard fund or something of that nature, you really can't touch that money for ~3 years).

So my question is: would it be advantageous to get this car loan out of the way? Or are there short-term investments that can return over 2%?

gaming,Idea for potentially new RTS game mechanic... Maybe there's something that already does this?,"So, I've been playing Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void recently, and it made me think about Warcraft and how it can move forward as a game without just being the same thing, different story.

What I came up with was to bring an RPG style element to it, as they did with heroes, but for all units. Now, hold on a second and give me a chance before saying that's stupid.

First, do away with different unit types, like Grunts and whatnot, and instead, each unit that you can recruit is unique and can be trained in different ways. So, let's say you start off in a campaign and you have 5 guys, and you need someone to build structures and gather resources, so you grab Floyd and put him to work doing that stuff. Now, Floyd gets stronger and more efficient, so he can carry more stuff and build faster as he does this type of work more. Then, you've got to have fighters, so you tell Harold to grab some gear and start clearing out creeps and shit, and he becomes better at hitting things and avoiding damage, fighting stuff. Same goes for researchers and everything. Just like an RPG, except for every individual. Now, each individual has say a village, or tribe, or whatever you want to call it, and members of that tribe will slowly replenish but they will learn from the ones that you are actually using in battle. So, if Harold becomes a gifted warrior, members of his tribe will start out as better warriors when they're first recruited. 

Along with this, all units are permanent and have permadeath. So, let's say you've taken Harold and Floyd on 5 missions, and Harold is a really good fighter, but then he dies, he's gone for good, but you can still recruit other members of his tribe who will have gained some of his attributes, but not be exactly the same.

As you might imagine, this can lead to some really complex game mechanics where you can train your units through giving them multiple different tasks. Like Floyd might be bad at hitting things, because he hasn't been a fighter, but he's really damn strong from hauling rocks around all day, so when he does connect, he does a lot of damage. Do a bit of cross training, and you can get a really powerful unit. ]

Additionally, it opens the door for between mission mechanics, for example tribe relations. If you just use Harold's tribe as cannon fodder and sacrifice a bunch of them, maybe they won't offer as many replacements. Or if you have limited supplies, you have to choose if one tribe stays fat and happy and another starves, or if they both feel the pain equally. These decisions could have longitudinal effects as well, where if a tribe gets fed well, the units that come out of it get larger and more plentiful. If starved, they get smaller, weaker, and fewer.

Beyond the mechanics outlined here, I think it would bring a very interesting emotional component to the game, where you have to make a decision about sending unique units in to possibly die. No more of this raise 30 Orc Grunts, send them to die, then raise 30 more, the only reason you care is because of the time and resource cost. If Floyd dies, it not only is a loss of an important unit, but it has a lasting effect on how the game will play out in the future, since that tribe was hurt by the loss of that knowledge/genetic material.

I think this could be a really interesting way for the franchise to move forward into something much more involved and interesting. As much as I love the stuff they've come out with in the past, I think this would be a valuable addition. Plus, it just begs for a pretty kickass name: Warcraft: Bloodlines.

personalfinance,My credit score dropped precipitously after I opened a new credit card and did two balance transfers. What am I missing?,"So I've never had incredible credit, but it's hovered around 750 for the last few years. I did build up $5000 in credit card debt in the last year with some employment troubles, but I always made my minimum payments at least and my credit was stable (according to creditkarma)

But in October I figured I would transfer my balances to avoid paying such high interest rates. I opened a new credit card and transferred $1200 to it (pretty low limit). I also transferred $3000 to another card.

Since then nothing has changed - I've kept making payments on time (now more than minimum payments since I'm working). I have one new card opened, so that was a hard inquiry according to Equifax.

But my credit score immediately dropped to 630. I figured this might've been a weird timing issue? Like they looked at my info in the middle of the balance transfers? And thought that I had suddenly incurred an extra $4200 in debt?

Two weeks later my score jumped back up to 700, so I thought it might fix itself, but it hasn't budged since then.

personalfinance,Back to school part-time to get some breathing space on student loan payments?,"So here's the situation:

I have a $115k in student loan debt, approximately $90k in private lenders and another $25k in federal.  This is actually from essentially two bachelor's degrees (got my first bachelors, paid down approximately 1/2 of the loans in 5 years, realized I needed to switch fields, went back to school for 2 years, added $70k more debt).   

I'm also sitting on about $9k of credit card debt (mostly from unavoidable major expenses related to health and auto).  I've paid down when I can (I destroyed the credit card last year so I can't use it even if I wanted). 

I've gotten a job at a prestigious research group, but I had to fight to get $17/hour -- but between state and federal taxes and company health insurance I'm losing about 25% of my paycheck (take home is approximately $1800).  If this job didn't look so good on my applications to medical school I would've moved back into my parents' basement and started to pay back my loans ASAP like I did last time.  

So, now the student loan deferment period comes to an end in January and even with the graduated repayment plan from Sallie Mae (taking an $800/month payment down to $450/month), between the loans and my credit card debt, I'm shelling out $1000/month in payments.  My rent to live in Boston is $750/month.  After taxes and health insurance my take home pay is $1800.  The job's schedule is so irregular (and when I say irregular, I mean:   I worked until midnight last night and have to show up for shift at 4AM tomorrow, I work 9-5 next week) that going out to find a second job is going to be incredibly difficult.
 
I looked at loan consolidation but currently my credit's in the low 600s due to a medical bill that I never received and my my high level of debt -- I just don't think I'm a good candidate at this point and from what I have seen it wouldn't lower my monthly payment by a significant amount.

My thought was to enroll in my home state's community college remotely part time (tuition would be $1200 total and a family member has volunteered to help me with some of that) and take some additional prerequisite classes I'd need for medical school, while still working full time.  That puts my loans into deferment and so I don't have to pay the full amount.  My thought is to pay a small amount monthly to my private loans, pay as much on the credit card as I could, and set back enough money in the semester to cover the full loan costs once summer starts -- then rinse and repeat in the fall until I get to medical school.  

It's not a perfect solution, but I can't see any better ones currently.  Any advice?",finance,1479446512

-$7000 on a car loan ($9k initial loan, 11%)

-$17k in student loan (3.0% interest, all federal).

-Credit score: 585 (yikes!)

1) I cannot for the life of me refinance my car loan. This is the biggest factor and I am just plain stuck. It's probably the biggest thing eating at me besides credit cards. My credit score is the biggest factor.

2) Is there a legitimate way to refinance all credit card debt into 1 payment, with a low credit score? I have looked online for options but I cannot find anything trustworthy.

2a) Additionally, what is the smarter play? The credit card debt is split amongst 3 cards. Is is smarter to split payments equally ($300 a month is what I can afford, so $100 each card) or to weight the payments differently toward each card? Is it better to try to get one to ""zero"" faster than the others or is it the same as paying each equally?

that I will need to pay for school all on my own. They have also left the country and since moved to Florida and I am living on my own for my last grade 12 year. I do not understand how this is fair that I submit their T-4 when they will not be helping me at all? Is there anyway to get around this or who could I talk to about getting financial help?

We have a MM Checking account with $4,900 in it, a .1% interest savings account with $750 in it, a 1% with $12,000 in it, and a few smaller accounts with about $400 tucked away.

We have a 15 year $55,000 mortgage at 4.65% with 1/11 paid off (first year owning). She has federal loans that are IBP, around $50 a month. I have IBP Fed loans around the same.

My personal loans are terrifying her though. I have around $30,000 on three 10 year student loans that average around a 9.5% interest rate.

We make around $33,000 annually. Work subsidizes our health insurance (I pay $120 monthly for Excellus Platinum), we both have two life insurances through our employer, and we both get 8% no matter the contribution to our IRAs from our employers.

We also have some credit card debt, around $1,000 for revolving credit, and a car payment of $350 monthly (one year from being paid off).

She keeps talking about getting a second job because we are financially in trouble in her words, and worries that my $500 student loans will cripple us. I am working on refinancing with a different bank, but the better rate loans require one year worth of payments.

personalfinance,"Six year old car needs repairs often, worth it to trade in?","Hi,
I got my 2011 Hyundai Sonata back in April, after my grandmother (sole owner and driver) wanted to get a new car. She bought the car in May, 2010. Since I have had it, I have put about 10k miles on it, and there are a total of 70k. Between me and the family, we have put $2k in repairs into the car since April, with the KBB initially being $8k. I am grateful for my family purchasing this car for me (mom and dad bought it from my grandma), I truly am, but it has caused me what I feel to be so many issues. My previous car was a 2002 Honda CR-V which had $3k in repairs over the 3 years I owned it. I am 21 years old, a senior in college, about to graduate in May, have an internship that I've been working at since July when I had to drive 2 hours each way to, and now I'm still here 20 hrs a week at only a 10 minute drive each way from my school. I'm about an hour and a half from my parents (with moderate traffic which there always is), and they'e had to visit me (and me go home) every other weekend because my car keeps breaking. At this point, I don't find it reliable, and I'm thinking I should trade it in before I have even more problems (we currently own 3 Hondas and a VW and never had this many problems with a car). I drive quite a bit admittedly, but I needed the internship, so I had no choice, I was putting about 6-700 miles a week on this car for 2 months, and now I put about 1-300 miles a week on it (if I go home, that is 150 miles round trip, otherwise only about 100 for 10 miles a day to and from work, plus the extra trips I take for coffee, shopping, a night out). I go back to my retail job too starting Thanksgiving, so I'm working every day during the week in the town next to school, going to school full time, working about 10 hours on the weekend at $10/hr and driving about 100 miles a day on the weekend (once home, once back to school, and each way to work because I live in West Bumblef***). 

We're almost positive the last fix (known as my breaking point) was caused by the dealership that f***ed it up when they replaced the steering column under warranty, but then when my parents brought it back to the dealership the next day, they charged $300 for their screw up. I feel that $2k in repairs on a 6 year old car with only 70k miles is excessive, we have a mini-van that is 3 years old with 80k on it already and needs less in repairs. Is it worth it to trade it in soon, or should I wait until it dies for good? I'm not sure what other information I would need to give you for an accurate assessment, but I'm really looking for advice! I have all of the information on the car and what had been done recently. I feel like I pushed my parents into agreeing to this, but maybe it is the right decision? 

Financial information:
2011 Hyundai Sonata, approx. value $7500

Deal at Honda- $500 extra down

Job- making $12/hr, will go up when I am offered the full time position. I started at $10 in July, went up last month. Virtually no expenses but gas, some food, and entertainment. Will live with my parents after graduating. 

Savings by the time I buy/lease- approx $2k to put down (with enough to cover my own expenses)

Other- Parents/grandma would be willing to put in about another $1-2k. 

I have approximately $5k in stocks, but I'd rather not touch those. Initially I wanted to save that to buy a car in 5 years, but I'm thinking this car may not last me and I may need to pay off student loans with this instead, or use for an apartment (aka renting my aunt's spare bedroom for like $200/month) when I go to grad school.

Total- approx. $10k to put down including trade-in.

Looking at: 2017 Honda Accord, Civic, or CR-V

Edit: In regards to credit history, I'm at about 730 FICO, my family each at about 780-800.

Not for me (perhaps at some point, but not today), but I'm sure some here are going to be interested given the subject matter.

I will say, this actually has real names among management - ""Before Innovative Industrial, Gold co-founded San Diego’s BioMed Realty, a publicly traded REIT that owned dozens of biotechnology buildings across the country. Before that, Gold was a top executive at publicly traded Alexandria Real Estate Equities, which specialized in office properties.

BioMed was acquired by private equity firm Blackstone Group early this year for $4.9 billion. 

Innovative Industrial has five workers. Others on the management team are from Iso Nano International, Realty Income, CoreSite Realty Corp and Real Estate Management Services.""

_____

""**Innovative Industrial doesn’t own any buildings yet**. It has non-binding letters of intent to buy two properties – one in New York and another in Illinois -- for $36 million. It expects to qualify to become a Real Estate Investment Trust.

REITs commonly specialize in specific property types – such as office buildings or strip malls. But Innovative Industrial is going after an unusual niche.

The company believes state-licensed medical cannabis growers sometimes struggle to get bank loans or other traditional financing for their businesses – in part because marijuana remains illegal under federal law.

One way they can free up capital is by selling indoor grow facilities to Innovative Industrial and then leasing the buildings back, according to the prospectus.""",finance,1479485024

Anyway, I have only $8600 in my 401k as I only started saving it at my current job.  I had to withdraw, take a tax penalty, and use my previous savings for a hardship years ago.

investing,"The upcoming rate hike, the VIX, and gold miners.","1) As many have noticed the VIX is down considerably, 13.22 with a 52w range of 11.02 - 32.09.
2) Gold, and miners to a lesser extent, are falling off a cliff due to the impending rate hike and perceived strength of dollar.
3) The rate hike percentage is about ~90%.

Admittedly, I am not the most experienced investor and trader, having only been active for the last few years, but in my experience rate hikes have caused the VIX to spike dramatically because of how they effect the market.

This time last year, the Fed hiked rates a quarter of basis point in December, and with the turmoil in China's yaun devaluation, caused massive market instability and selloff.

If the Feds hike rates next month, shouldn't VIX rise considerably (since stronger dollar would imply less stock/$ value)?

[Moreover, the yaun is at an eight year low as reported two days ago.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-16/china-s-yuan-tumbles-to-eight-year-low-as-banks-weaken-forecasts#media-1) If the US hikes rates it will make the dollar stronger and consequently further damage the yaun.

My experience suggests that the Chinese will try to modify their monetary policy and value to compensate the hike, as the capital 'flood' away from China and into US investments has been ongoing.

In short, if rates hike, the VIX should pop, especially with the current condition of China (not to mention Brexit/Euro issues). We should see a minor sell-off. If China pulls the trigger before raise rates then, like Brexit or China last year, Yellen would likely sit on the sidelines.

What am I missing? Can rates be raised in the current global environment without the VIX going crazy?

Edit: If China devalues before rate hike, gold skyrockets. I feel like gold miners and VIX is 'the play'. Oil also factors. If we hike and oil drops vs. the dollar, do we also see a market that follows oil into the depths of sub $40/b?",finance,1479485460

personalfinance,"Bank of America is refusing to give back $9,800 to my dad's account after someone fraudulently stole his funds.","On the night of November 1st/early morning of November 2nd, someone made 8 separate withdrawals of $600 each(Total $4800) at ATM machines in Tarrytown, White Plains, and lower Manhattan from my dad's account and then phone transferred another $5000 from his savings account to his checking account. Then the thief made three purchases at Target with a debit card, charging $1000, $2000, and $2000 respectively. The total amount that was taken out of my father's account was $9,800.

When he checked his email on November 4th, my father immediately called Bank of America and notified them of the fraud and filed two claims (one for the saving and one for the checking accounts).

After waiting several business days for the result of the investigation, my father called BofA to check on the status of the claim and was told the claims could not be paid because they did not see any errors on their part with their system! They reopened the claim but then closed it again several days later.
I don't understand how the bank can deny responsibility. My dad has never told anyone the pin number for his debit card(not even members of his own family). When you put money in a bank, it is suppose to be safe and now he feels violated because not only was this money stolen from him, but now they are trying to say that they are not at fault.

He was informed by a BofA associate that someone had called in requesting a new debit card on Oct. 27, 2016, but he did not make a call to BofA on that date. I don't understand why the bank would allow this unusual activity to go through, or how they could let a thief phone transfer his money between his savings and checking accounts! Also, how can the bank authorize a new debit card to be mailed and what exactly is required for this request to be granted? He did not make the call to request a new debit card! Where are the security checks in place for any of this?
My father filed a police report and the detectives assured him at that time that the bank would return the cash. They said that as long as the fraud is reported within 60 days, the bank has an obligation to return the funds.

The last time he spoke with a BofA manager in a local branch, they actually reassured him that he would be getting his money back and that the process just takes time.

But this is the letter that my father received from BofA today:

We’ve completed our investigation of your above referenced claim and based on our findings, we’re unable to honor the claim

Fraud and Claims


At this point, what should he be doing? Contacting the local news? Getting a lawyer and suing BofA? I asked him to mail a certified letter with return receipt to BofA so that there is a paper trail of all of this.

According to the FTC, he should be fully covered.
https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/…/0213-lost-or-stolen-credit-a…


Edit:  Thank you all for your replies and comments.  I will do research into what federal agencies to file complaint at and I will keep everyone updated on any additional details.  In the meantime, I will try to answer some of the questions that were posed:

1) The thief called BofA and requested a new atm/debit card on October 27th and it was mailed to my parent's home address.  I believe that whoever called BofA to request the card also stole it from the mail.  My mom's account at BofA was not compromised but my parents were very upset and did not want to take any chances, so they requested replacement cards for both their accounts (their accounts are not linked) after the incident. 
BOfA mailed my dad's debit/atm card and pin on separate days as requested, but my mom's new debit/atm card and pin still arrived in the mail on the same day.  I am guessing that this is how the thief was able to get ahold of the card/pin.  

2) A lot of people are asking why the withdrawal limit was so high.  My dad received a letter in the mail a few days after the fraud occurred letting them know that their withdrawal limit was increased to $2400.  Apparently, the thief called in and requested to increase the daily limit.  They then made 4x$600 withdrawals right before midnight on November 1st, and 4x$600 withdrawals in the early morning of November 2nd.  By the time my dad got the notice that his withdrawal limit had been increased, his money was already long gone.

3) I have no idea why the thief had to do a phone transfer to move the remaining 5k from the savings account to the checking account.  I would think that you could do a transfer right at the ATM. I think there should be a recording of all of these various phone transactions and BofA frankly does not care to look into them.  They also don't care to look at the videos from the ATMs.  

Edit#2: Update
Great news!  Bank of America has returned the money to my dad's bank account.  He received an email to log into his BofA account to check some new messages.  After he logged in, he saw that his funds had been returned and the messages stated that his subsequent follow up claims had been approved.

The next step is to find out from BofA and exactly what information the perpetrator had that allowed them to request a new debit card from BofA to be mailed to my dad's address.  I saw a lot of comments that asked why my dad didn't file a police report, but he did!  I realize that the first post was a huge block of text, but I did mention that he filed a police report. It's just buried in that text.  A lot of people also mentioned that it might be someone close to him such a a family member, but this is pretty much impossible.  My mom and dad immigrated to the US over 30 years ago, so we actually don't have any other family members here, as the rest of the extended family is overseas.  I'm their only child and I live on the west coast while they still live in NY.  I also doubt that they fell into bad company because they are some of the most straight laced boring people you'll ever meet, lol.  They don't drink, gamble, smoke, etc. In any case, the next step is definitely to figure out how this happened in the first place. Hopefully BofA will be able to provide us more information in that regards.",finance,1479488839

The Blockchain technology allows us to send assets in a Peer-to-Peer trustless way. 
So why not develop an Internet of Things the same way we developed an Internet of Information, an Internet of Communication and an Internet of Values? 
Furthermore, creating a Peer-to-peer C2C transportation system of objects is a way to share work and economic value inside a growing Community.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMolrKu6T4

**Main features:**
- Self-executing contractual states (smart contracts)
- Localization and events tracking of luggage or postboxes
- Deposit insurance
- A global Democratic Organization to serve a global and distributed Community

**Delivery smart contracts**
Smart contracts are self-executing contractual states, stored on the Blockchain, which nobody controls and therefore everyone can trust. They are computer protocols that can make traditional contractual clause unnecessary and even provide security superior to traditional contract law. Furthermore, smart contracts reduce other transaction costs associated with contracting.

Smart contracts run on a global and decentralized machine (the Ethereum Virtual Machine). They are stored in a ledger that anyone can watch. There is no need of additional server and database for the storage of contracts. 

Smart contracts use digital assets for the payment of fee or deposit. Sender does not need to make a prepayment and receiver can easily buy a specific local product from or to a remote region. In this last case, the courier buys and sends the item to the receiver. Because all the characteristics of the item are predefined and stored in the Blockchain, disputes about the item should be rare. We think that this will allow reducing frontiers in particular with rural regions.

For a delivery, the smart contracts are between physical or virtual objects (postboxes and luggage). Users and couriers ""sign"" the smart contract as owners of objects and have no legal obligation because of the smart contract. On the other hand, because objects do not lie and can be tracked, delivery smart contracts can check delivery conditions in a flexible, trustless and automatic way. For instance, the delivery conditions can foresee to reduce the return of deposit by 10% per day after a predefined date. The smart contract applies delivery rules with no need to go to court or make a complaint to insurance company. 

**Smart luggage**
Each traveler who wants to work as a courier just needs to use the courier application. He can even deliver parcels without any luggage. In that case, the luggage is “virtual” and as physical luggage has a specific public ID key. Th­­­­­­e courier can increase the quality of service fixing an electronic device into a “smart” luggage.

The electronic device includes the next features:
- Micro sensors (temperature, magnetometer)
- GPS module
- Microcontroller and Cryptographic Authentication
- Low-energy consumption and low-cost communication with a global network

**Smart postboxes**
A user who wants to send or receive a parcel without necessity to meet the courier can use a physical smart postbox with a network connection, a digital scale, a camera and an unlocking system for the couriers (with their Blockchain private key for instance).

- If the sender wants to meet the courier, he can in the same way take a picture and weigh the parcel in attendance of the courier.
- If the receiver wants to check himself the parcel, he can meet the courier with the parcel.
- In these two cases, the postboxes are “virtual” and as physical postboxes have a specific public ID key.

**Deposit insurance**
The reputation tokens of the couriers involved in parcels transfer will be updated according to their accuracy. 

For the senders and receivers, tokens are used for deposit insurance. Couriers will be able to transfer only packages with a price less than the reputation tokens they can lose in case of not or bad delivery. If the receiver does not receive the parcel, the sender receives valuable tokens of the person(s) in charge of the transfer of parcel and which were hold as insurance deposit. 

In this way, it will be more profitable for couriers to operate with urgently or to transfer expensive parcels, but will have more risk to lose some amount of their reputation.

**Disputes**
The smart contracts, which are between physical or virtual objects, self-execute contractual states concerning the payment of fees and deposit insurance with tradable digital assets. It is important to note that because we have no contract between legal persons or entities, users or couriers cannot refer to the law in case of disputes concerning a delivery. **For this reason, the courier should check that there is no prohibited items in the parcel before taking it**.

Furthermore, using smart luggage’s or postboxes will prevent many disputes given that these objects generate automatic events. With smart objects, disputes must be rare or easier to fix. Another point is the ability to store comments from users about previous courier services. Because contracts are between objects and not persons, it will be possible to publicize information of a delivery without infringing the right to privacy. This point will avoid many disputes, as couriers know that proved bad deliveries can damage the reputation of their service. 

However, we understand that it will be difficult to avoid any disputes using technical, smart or not smart, objects. In addition, we understand too that it could be easy to damage reputations giving information, which are not confirmed. Therefore, we think that it is important to allow a mediation, arbitration and resolution of eventual disputes. In case of dispute about a delivery, we suggest a decentralized consensual arbitration of the Community. Because it is decentralized, it means that no central authority can affect the decision. And because disputes will be rare, the shared cost for arbitration will be low.

**Whitepaper Rev1.1.pdf** - http://pacifics.org/uploads/s/l/4/e/l4ejxqrwsl3p/file/SIQStcXA.pdf


The next diagram shows how we can transfer parcels in a Peer-To-Peer way (without any server or central organization) using the Blockchain for registering the smart contracts and the events, and using the Internet of Things for tracking smart luggage or postboxes.  

An electronic device is fixed once in the suitcase of each courier when initializing. When the courier takes the package, he signs with his phone a delivery smart contract with a payment of a deposit in the Blockchain. And he closes his suitcase after having put the package inside. The delivery characteristics were initially pre-recorded in the smart contract by the sender or receiver of the parcel. When checking and transferring the package, the second courier gets the events from the first courier suitcase, signs with his phone another smart contract and puts the package in his suitcase. This unlocks the deposit of the first courier and blocks the second deposit in the Blockchain. 

Note : in a smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain, it is possible to store events with the smart contract.

**Correlation between the delivery smart contract (How it works ) and the Dao (Why)**
The idea is to serve a Community of couriers, or central postbox services, using a global distributed and democratic organization. In this way, we can serve a global Community without creating a new centralized courier service like FedEx or DHL. The PassLfix team will serve only as the project managers of the PASS Dao. Marketing, communication, electronic supply and/or other services will be realized by others companies. The PASS Dao shareholders will make those decisions, and the project will belong to them, and not us.



**Why?**
**To set up and revise the user and courier mobile applications without any end date**
By creating a DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) on the Blockchain for the project, we create a system for a Community that will live and grow without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. DAO shareholders will be able to get reputation tokens during the project stage. 
 
**To manage the project of the creation of a Peer-to-peer C2C transportation system of objects**
Everyone can be a member of the Community participating in the crowdfunding, which will allow starting the project. First, the Community needs a Project Management and IT team to set up the application for our new DAO. Our team proposes to do this work step by step. We will be motivated to do a good job for a fair price. Unless, the DAO can decide to stop contracting with us.
 
**To contract with the best specialists offering to help developing a global system**
The DAO Community can organize a new funding and chooses its contractors. The application will be global but some tasks can be better or cheaper when they are done locally (marketing, electronic devices ...). Every contractor can offer our DAO to sell products or to execute services. Every product or service, which could help developing the system and, consequently, increase the reputation tokens value will be interesting for DAO shareholders.
 
**To serve a global Community of people who shares work and economic value**
After launching the application, travelers wishing to use the system will buy reputation tokens from Dao shareholders and form a couriers Community. Everyone can be a member of this Community and all the couriers are autonomous travelers. In this way, the organization will serve a global and distributed couriers Community without any central authority and without any frontier.

**Read the Smart Contract Description** -  https://github.com/pacifics/Dao

**Pass DAO** is a transparent distributed organization where governance and decision making system are immutably programmed in the Blockchain. All the decisions regarding the organization are taken by the shareholders of the organization with voting procedures called board meetings.

During the development phase, the organization pays contractors for project management, marketing and communication. Reputation tokens are rewarded to the shareholders of the organization by the Project Manager. 

During the exploitation phase, the central postboxes (logically located at railway stations or airports) and couriers (autonomous travelers or organizations) will buy from shareholders reputation tokens that are used to pay deposit by the application. And they will pay fees to the organization for technical assistance, mediation service with users and electronic devices if provided by the organization.

echnically, the Dao is a smart contract runing on the Ethereum blockchain. The Dao smart contract is set with a primary funding linked to a first Project Manager proposal. If the funding is fueled, the proposal can be completed, otherwise the sent amount can be refunded. The Dao rules are set to allow voting on new proposals after the primary funding. After this first funding, the Dao smart contract will live according to the democracy law.

**Rules of the Primary Funding**

**Read the Project Manager Proposal** - http://pacifics.org/uploads/s/l/4/e/l4ejxqrwsl3p/file/QjLMYY2E.pdf

Only registered normal Eth accounts (and not smart contracts) will be valid addresses for the funding. Each Eth account can send between 1 Eth and 100 Eth. Before the end date of the presale, the Project Manager can close the presale setting the limitations rules (amount and percentage of ether balance share for all partners) for the funding. The amount sent during the presale below the set limits funds the Dao and the amount sent during the presale above the set limits is refunded. 

Partners become shareholders and get Dao shares according to the sent amount, the set limits and the share price* set in the Funding rules. The Dao pays the Project Manager the amount of the Project Manager proposal and the Dao shareholders receive Pass Reputation tokens according to the amount funded and presale date, the initial token price and the inflation rate** set in the contractor proposal. An initial supply of 2 millions Pass Reputation tokens will be rewarded to the Project Manager. This step will last a couple of days. After the presale deadline, all the sent ethers that didn't fund the Dao can be refunded.
 
* 1000 Pass Dao shares = 1 Eth. The price is constant during the funding. 
 ** 1000 Pass Reputation tokens= (1 + 365*(presaleDate - presaleStartTime)/(100*365 days)) Eth. Inflation of 1% per day during the presale.

**About us**
Our team includes 2 main engineers with a 40 years combined experience in project management. Located in Moscow, we have been working together since 2008. Our interest for the Blockchain technology started in 2011 with Bitcoin and became strong since 2014 with Ethereum and the concept of smart contracts. In june 2016, we had the idea to use the Blockchain in order to help the delivery of parcels to or from remote regions and when postal services are not efficient.

personalfinance,"Community college wrote me a bad check, won't take responsibility for bank fees, advice?","I am a 39 y/o freshman at a community college. A few weeks after getting the bulk of my federal financial aid money, I received a second check from the school for $4.00, with no explanation, but that happened last year with a larger sum and it was no big deal. So I cash the check for $4.00, and my credit union informs me yesterday that a stop payment has been issued, and they are taking a $15.00 fee (WTF!?). I call the school today, and after several calls and a major run-around I get the Director of Enrollment Services who won't tell me why this $4.00 check was sent out, or why a stop payment was issued, only that they insist I was notified of the stop payment (I most certainly was not) and there is nothing else that they are willing to do.

$19.00 might not seem like a lot to you, but I have almost no income and struggling to keep a roof over my head, that's my food budget for a whole week and to not get that back is really going to hurt, especially this week since I'm not able to work any hours while things are partially shut down for the Thanksgiving holiday (I don't have the type of jobs that give holiday pay).

I have been with my credit union for years, always in good standing, never any overdrafts, fees or anything like that, I am going to see if I have any luck getting them to waive the $15.00. I got an old bank to do that once over some matter outside of my control.

Is there anything else I can try? I will not be going back to this same shady fucking community college next semester, that is for sure, there are plenty of others in my area.

Thanks a ton.

personalfinance,Call your cc companies and ask them to lower your rates,"I spend a crap ton of money on one of my cards (Barclaycard US) for my business and typically carry a decent balance from month to month. Most months I'm able to pay off last month's purchases and I avoid paying interest, but sometimes I have some larger purchases that take a few months to pay down. Getting hit with those high interest charges can take your breath away!

I have a very good relationship with Barclaycard US so I decided to call them up and see if they'd lower my rate down from 25.24%. I had no clue if they would or could.

Apparently you may have ""offers"" that go onto your account after they do a review of your account (they do this automatically 2-3 times a year, I was told). They will NOT notify you in any way shape or form of this offer and you have to actually call in and ask them. They told me that all cc companies do this, but your mileage may vary.

They reduced my rate from 25.24% to 21.24%. Not a huge decrease IMO, but it will still save me a bunch of money. I'll start asking them twice a year or so, probably when I ask for a CL increase. 

TL;DR: call and ask your cc companies to lower your interest rates if you carry a balance. They just might!



Edit: 



I sell and repair appliances and typically spend over $10,000/month or more on my cards between purchasing materials and inventory. I pay this off usually within the month so I don't pay interest. Sometimes a special deal comes up from a vendor where I might want to buy an extra $10,000 in inventory for stock and sell it at a later date to make much better profit. 

I am still building my inventory and showroom displays, so until I finish in will be purchasing more appliances than I sell.

Carrying a balance in those instances is good short term option since I do not have any lines of credit from a bank. I need to get one, working on my books and whatnot in preparation of going to a bank.",finance,1479522362

personalfinance,What am I missing here with refinancing my house,"Background: I bought a condo with my brother, it's under a ARM and the condo is under my name. I got married moved out and my brother continues to live in the condo and make payments straight to the bank. He got married and wants to continue to stay here, but he wants to roll the loan over to him. I'm fine with this btw, I didn't live here more than 3 years and my brother has since gone to bat and co-signed for my wife and I new home. 
Fast forward 2 years. He wants to start the process of rolling(assuming the condo loan) and I want to remove him from my loan and title. 

Here's my specifics:
Original loan: $485000
20 pct down to avoid PMI
Conventional fixed 30 yr loan at 4.25
Current loan sits at $365000
House Value (on Zillow $589,000)
Payments at $2450
Called my lender and they fine with me refinancing, removing my brother from loan and title, paying the appraisal and closing cost at $1200. In addition, cash out of $35000 to pay off wife's school loans (every month $300)
This is what they offered:
New loan amount with cash out: $405000 (closing cost rolled in)
New rate of 4.375 (because of cash out bumped it up, is that correct, I thought rates dropped)
New payment of $2550
This would be a savings of $200 a month and her students loans are paid off and I can throw that at her car payment and pay it off sooner. My brother will be assuming the loan soon as well. I still don't understand with the rates dropping and my debt to ratio would be fine because of the equity as he indicated, why the rate bumped. Can someone help me, I called penfed earlier, and they offered 4.00, but the payments where pretty on par with what I'm paying now, minus a hundred but my closing would be $5000 and I'm only allowed to take $25000 cashout and with the closing, it'll be $20000. How can the rate be lower and paying about the same that I'm paying now? So confused... Thanks, I'm not the best when it comes to understanding mortgage and points and rates.",finance,1479532574

personalfinance,Is it better to rent out an older home or sell?,"Currently owe $109,000 with 3.99% interest rate on a house I bought in 2012 and it was appraised February 2016 at $180,000. I refinanced for a lower interest rate and a cash out for some repairs to the house, so I still have 29 years left.

I'm currently debating whether to sell or rent. I'm interviewing property management companies that seem to consistently say that it could be rented out for $1100- $1250 a month, which after my mortgage, taxes, insurance, management fees, etc. leaves me with $250-450 a month in profit. There is also about $3000 in updates and improvements that would need to be made for renters, but if I was selling it could just be sold as is.

Neither selling or renting has a clear financial advantage (that I can see). The house is in the phoenix area in a good neighborhood, but it was built in 1975 and and I'm most likely going to need to replace the roof in the next 5-10 years and the AC unit passed it's warrantee period 6 years ago so I could end up sinking a lot of cash into the house on top of the cost of cleaning up and repairs after renters. 

I won't get a lot from selling and I'd be losing out on a good investment, but keeping it and renting it out could be more costly than I can handle. I'd be a long distance landlord, and since I'm moving to a high cost of living area I don't know if I can balance rent, the mortgage and unexpected repairs. 

I'm not emotionally attached to the house, it's not my dream house and I don't think I'll be coming back to Phoenix to live there again. I'm 28, single, no kids and I have a lot of student loans and almost nothing in retirement. 

I'm personally leaning towards selling the house and using any profits to catch up on things like maxing out my 401k contribution, emergency fund, and other investments. However, I know that I could be missing out on a valuable future payoff by selling it.

Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1479560586

* FERS buy-back would give me an extra 1.6 percent, which would equal $2,080/year.  It would take me 103 years to make up the cash-value.

Is this thing totally locked up until then? Can I grab it out of there and pay a fee? (My thought being that if I figure out where to save my money and its about 1%, its an easy calculation to see if the fee is less than the interest I'd make otherwise, sure it's down to pennies basically but I'd like to have everything in one place)

I basically work for a clown company, I'm an engineer and when works good I can make up to 130k, when it's iffy, I bottom out at 71k. Sure that is totally a livable salary at 27 and single, but at the moment there is no 401k match etc etc. I put in 6% now (the old match was half up to 6%, and I never adjusted it after it was suspended) And have about 18k in my 401k after being in the workforce for 5 years.

**Total estimated:** ~$290k *(&lt;- not eligible for IRA)*

**Net worth:** $370k (low as income has grown 3.5x in 4 years. SR net of tax is ~65%)

**FIRE timeline**: ~2035

As the dreaded tax season starts to loom in front of us, I’ve been doing some preliminary tax calculations. We’ll be going from ~37.3% to ~43.2% (+5% Fed, + 0.9% Supplemental Medicare) next year.

At present, we are committing a cardinal sin by only using 36k of our 54k tax advantaged as we are saving for a down payment (SF Bay Area). We have a tight timeline due to family history with fertility/birth defects and are thinking 2018 for kids &amp; house.

I am considering maxing out the remaining 18k of space, which would save $8k in 2017 taxes. If I then took a 401k loan for a down payment in 2018, we could pay it back with money taxed in a lower tax bracket (due to kids, 529 and a mortgage) in 2018/19, netting us a $1.1k tax saving. This would not affect our ability to contribute to our retirement accounts. Paying off the loan in the event of a job loss is not a concern.

I’ve no interest in having a long term equity position in my employer. Given these are leveraged, &lt;10% of our portfolio and are taxed at exercise, not vesting, I’m considering holding until 2018 (save $2k in taxes at current values).

personalfinance,Advice Needed: Attempting to Wrangle in my Finances,"Hello there Everyone!

This is my first time posting and I'm looking forward to some awesome advice. So, let's get to it!

I am 27 years old and currently make $51,000 per year with a lot of opportunity to grow in my current position. I am planning on speaking with my employer the beginning of the year and asking for my salary to be bumped up to $60,000 per year but expect my boss to counter with around $55,000 per year.

I currently own my house and it was appraised at $127,500 last year (purchased for 125,000). I got a HELOC on the house for $30k to spruce up the house and I let the stack of money get the best of me. Since July of 2015 I've spent the entire $30k on improving the house and also other things it shouldn't have been spent on.

My bring home per paycheck is approx. $1352.80 (paid bi-weekly). This amount does not include my 401k contribution. I also put 10% of each paycheck into my savings. This leaves me with about $1217.52 per paycheck. My total monthly bills come out to about $2744.29. Here is a quick break down of my monthly bills:

- Netflix.com - $12.71
- Gym - $10.00
- Car Ins. - $74.00
- Apple - $0.99
- Comenity CC - $50.00
- Kohls CC - $50.00
- Barclay CC - $100
- HELOC - $430.00
- Verizon - $270.00
- Charter - $160.00
- GHS (Hospital Bill) - $40.00
- Student loans - $300.00
- Spotify - $10.59
- Attorney - $200.00
- Home Ins. - $110.00
- Water - $60.00
- Electricity - $150.00
- Natural Gas - $100.00
- Garbage - $16.00
- Property Tax - $75.00
- Food - $300.00
- Spend Money - $100.00
- Car Fuel - $75.00
- Car Maint. - $50.00


You can quickly see that with my current monthly income I'm in the red by about $309.25 per month. This is largely due to me boosting my monthly payment on my HELOC by $130 per month and also the $200 Attorney fees I have which started 2 months ago. The reason I am paying more towards the HELOC is to cover the insurance I have on the Loan. I pay .043 cents per $100 of the outstanding monthly balance of the loan which comes to about $129 per month. This insurance covers Life/Dis/UnEmp so that if one of those events were to occur then I can have breathing room or whoever I leave the house to can. The minimum payment is $300 per month on the HELOC but once I pay that and then the insurance comes in it wipes out what I have paid on the principle. This has caused me to not have touched the principle. Since starting the loan I've paid $4k and I still owe $30k, this is why I have to pay the extra $130 to cover that insurance.

Additional information: I do pay into a 401k and Roth IRA that my employee matches at 3%. I put $50 into the 401k and $50 into the Roth each pay period. I also have the 10% per pay check that goes directly to my savings account. I also have a SIMPLE IRA from my old employer with a little over $1200 that I don't contribute to any longer, and I don't really know what to do with it. Since my Dad passed away a few years ago my Mom has come to live with me and I pay for everything, hence why the power, water, natural gas, food, and cell phone is so high. I also pay an another bill of once every few months, depending on if my Mom needs assistance with it. I also have student loans in the amount of about $23k.

So, I would love some advice on how to wrangle in my finances and make them work for me a bit better. I recently (this week) started using YNAB in an effort to help. I am young and make some decent income but at this time I'm starting to feel like I'm slowly sinking under the weight of my debt. My total debt is coming in at $56,234.85 which scares the living day lights out of me. Any suggestions would be much appreciated and if you can spot areas that I can tidy up please let me know.

personalfinance,How to Choose the Right Bank for Me,"Hello. So I'm a college-bound 18 year old, and I'm getting tons of conflicting info on which bank is the best for me.

I have a family tradition of never using credit. Ever. And I intend to go off of cash and debit only until I get a steady job. I'm extremely money-cautious, and I want to open a savings account that allows me to make transactions using a debit card in a bank that has both a great reputation, and a good interest rate.

The problem is that I'm naive and have no idea what to look for in a bank (aside from the things I mentioned above), and I want to avoid banks with hidden fees.

What should I look for in a bank, where can I find those (detailed and unbiased) things to look for, and what are some good bank suggestions?

Any input at all is greatly appreciated.

Edit: Made my search more realistic (and less naive).",finance,1479593952

personalfinance,Trouble deciding a budget program,"Hi PF, thanks for all of the data and stories. I am looking forward to whittling down and eliminating my student debt while at the same time saving for travel and life experiences.

Info about me: I am 28/M, employed FT, have a manageable amount of student debt, want to begin saving for retirement.

I currently do not own any assets other than a few bars of silver, my net worth is entirely liquid at the moment. I also have enough for a 3-6 month emergency  fund.

I have the basics down and I am a good saver, however, I am having trouble finding a good budget program to use. 

I was using [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4odwob/psa_google_sheets_has_monthly_and_annual_budget/) google docs as a monthly budget expense tracker and annual budget, however, I am having issues with categorizing my expenses. I found the monthly categories did not seamlessly match up with the annual categories. It is a headache trying to come up with a system of categorization that tracks my money.  With these google sheets I find you have to treat expenses and their categorie(s) either quite generic or overly specific. 

I am not sure there is a perfect way to budget but I am not happy with these google docs. I find they don't allow me to track groceries vs. eating out without either making me create too many individual spending categories for each purchase, or requiring a lot of manual input to get the specific data points I want.

Basically, I want to see how much I spend on ""healthy"" purchases (necessities) like groceries, insurance, fuel vs ""unhealthy"" purchases(frivolous) like eating out and coffee/alcohol. PLUS, I want to be able to see how much money I plan to contribute to student loans and my retirement.

What have you found to be helpful with your budget? Do you use one or multiple tools to track your expenses and savings/investments?

I have only briefed myself on YNAB and I don't see it being easy to rectify my student debt and also track a retirement account but perhaps I am mistaken. (I qualify for the free year as a student *thumbs up*). Also, I hear that MINT is buggy and Personal Finance doesn't allow a lot of customization with expense categorization.

I'm losing motivation with this budget. I don't mind manually entering in expenses as long as it is specific enough to categorize my preferences. I am hesitant to auto-upload my data to a website, however, I am not opposed to it.",finance,1479598515
personalfinance,What is expected to happen to the US housing market over the next 2 years?

Now with the Donnald winning and all the economic uncertainty, I have no idea what to do as I'm scared interest rates will go up and hurt my ability to get a decent house payment . Are they predicting any major changes in house prices or interest rates in the next year or 2? Google searches didn't give me any good results. Maybe this question is too speculative.

economy,Free market,"The idea of individual freedom in our society, dominates are politics and political views. This is the idea that individuals are free from oligarchs and old elites, and not be subjected by class or income. This has manifested into a global revolution towards Democracy and it ideals.

But under analysis this is a system driven by targets and numbers. The government today who are responsible for looking after and enforcing individual rights have actually seen a rise in inequality and the return of the super wealthy and privileged few.



After the Second World War freedom from Nazi oppression wasn’t the only thing people wanted. People believed it to be the start of a new era. Freedom from the economic chaos of the 1930’s which led to the depression, couldn’t be allowed to happen again. In Britain we see this regulatory view point take off with the rise of the labour party after the war. Essentially governments thought it was their role to try and control the economy and protect society from the self interest of capitalism.

Friedrich Von Hayek was an Austrian aristocrat who fled Nazi occupation during the war. He then began to lecture at the University of Chicago. His argument was that the use of politics to plan society was by far more dangerous than any problems produced by capitalism, because it eventually led to the end of freedom and to tyranny. The example that he used for this was the Soviet Union, who in their desire to plan and control everything, eventually it lead them into Tyranny and dictatorship. He said that the same would happen to the west in a book he published called “The Road to Serfdom”. Friedrich Von Hayek ideas went on to influence Ronald Reagan and also Margret Thatcher, and what economic policies they would in force in their own countries.

In 1979 Margret Thatcher had come to power in Britain. What she promised was to create was a society based on the ideas of individual freedom. To do this she would turn to systems based on the objective power of numbers. The Thatcher government had begun in the early 80’s by selling off state owned industries. After some time it became clear that certain sectors of society would have to remain under government supervision. But Margret Thatcher wanted to take control of these too.  To achieve this Margret Thatcher would bring in a system that public servants would be encouraged by incentives to follow the own self interest.

Are economy today is centrally planned. It is planned by central banks. The low interest rates favour speculators, to the point where unsustainability has now gripped the global economy. This is going to force one of two outcomes.

Central banks begin to raise interest rates, which would in turn spur interbank lending, which would be inflationary, which is what is needed to curb a deflated economy. Or raise the minimum wage, which would also cause inflation and resolve the problem. To favour anything else is only benefitting the speculators and the borrowers. This is at the expense of everybody else, who is not in this inner circle of borrowing with impunity at 0 risk.",finance,1479604908

Bitcoin,Danger of Scaling Bitcoin,"I've noticed lots of discussion about how to scale bitcoin, and very little about why.  It is my understanding that the purpose of scaling would be to enable the network to process more transactions per unit of time.  It is not clear to me whether this would be wise.

I invest in bitcoin like it were gold.  Although I've made a small number of online purchases with BTC, I mostly trade fiat for BTC on exchanges and then send the BTC to my wallet.  When I send fiat from my bank to an exchange (or to another fiat bank), it usually takes about a week before I can access the funds (or longer for large checks).  When I purchase gold coins and have them shipped to me,  it usually takes longer than a week (and costs a nice chunk of change).  When I transfer bitcoins between wallets/institutions, it takes a few seconds to appear and perhaps a half hour to be confirmed.   This is lightning speed compared to gold and fiat.  I would be completely satisfied if the duration of bitcoin transactions were several times longer than they are now; bitcoin would still serve the investment function of gold very well.  Since I do not trust the security of the spying devices we call smartphones, I have no interest in buying stuff or transferring money (fiat or bitcoin) using a smartphone.  
 
Do people want to scale bitcoin so it can compete with bank-issued credit cards, Paypal, and other retail payment systems?   Was this Nakamoto's intention?  Do bitcoin entrepreneurs think the large banks (and their political beneficiaries) will surrender their profits without a fight?   When the governments of America, China, and the EU decide to help their partners in crime by shutting down bitcoin exchanges and other popular websites that facilitate the buying and selling of bitcoin (using the pretense that BTC facilitates terrorism, tax evasion, and other illegal activity), what will happen to the value of my digital gold?

I used to make money playing online poker (which I declared on my taxes), using PayPal and then Neteller to easily transfer money between my bank and the gambling sites.  Online gambling was opposed by the ""legal"" casinos in America, as well as perhaps some state-level politicians who feared that customers of online gambling sites might spend less money on state lottery tickets.  The feds eliminated the ability of Americans to easily transfer fiat to gambling sites (e.g., via Neteller) and the FBI raided and closed some sites; they even arrested employees of foreign poker sites and got them to ban American customers.   I believe the ""too big to fail"" banks are far more powerful than casinos. 

EDIT:  I forgot to mention the other reason I have no interest in making small everyday purchases with bitcoin; it creates an accounting nightmare for Americans!   Every purchase is a taxable event requiring that we calculate the cost basis of the bitcoins that were spent.  If using bitcoins to pay for goods and services became widespread, we could wind up in the dangerous position of most bitcoin users (at least in America) being tax cheats.",cryptocurrency,1479609964
investing,Taking out a mortgage for investing purposes,"Hello, first time caller here.

We (wife, 2 kids) own our own house and have a modest income from our small business (approx 35k). I'm interested in taking out a mortgage on the house with plans to re-invest the cash in assets susceptible to inflation. I suspect the presidents policies will cause both inflation and therefore interest rates to rise in response.

I can get 300k at 3.2% on a 15 year or 300k at 3.9% on a 30 year. 

My instinct is to take the lower APR for a shorter time, but I understand that may be wrong. Can you explain to me in what situation the higher APR/longer loan term would be better?

gaming,I am a bad dad?,"Ok, here is the story. I'm a seperated dad who sees his kids every other weekend. Around 1 year ago I let my son play Rainbow Six Seige on my gaming PC where I live. He has now fallen in love with it. He loves unlocking new operators putting little peek holes and is AMAZING at the game. Once he roamed outside and snuck up behind the enemy team and knifed all of them and got accused of hacking! Anyway, to cut a long story short, he loves the competitive nature of the game and follows it on YouTube and has recently seen the new operators and unlocked caveira. He loves the game!

Anyway fast forward one year to now. Over the last two days I had an early Christmas around my mates house whilst Cat sitting his house while he was away with his wife. We had Christmas dinner and everything. My 13 YO girl and my 11 YO boy were there and they played Chubby Brussels with the sprouts, it was fun. They both got multiple presents of which one was an XBOX 1 with rainbow six seige for my son (my ex said I couldn't get him a gaming PC because they didn't have the room. That's another story).

We spend several hours setting up the game and his own UPLAY account after his sister went home. She's 13 and doesn't like sleeping over anywhere but home. Anyway he played the game until around 11pm and he slowly got used to the controls and started to unlock more operators. He was loving it having his own copy of Rainbow 6 Seige to take home.

The time came for him to go home as his sister had already gone but he just wanted a few more games of rainbow six seige of which by now he was getting MVP on multiple games be loves the competitive team play of the game.

So anyway. This is were is all goes wrong, I get him home and the first thing is his little step brother says to him is you are only allowed to play the 12 games not the 18 games. I found out that older 13 yo sister had told on him to his mother who is a teacher. I had some argument with her about how much he loves the game and it's more about competition than violence and how I thought he was emotionally mature enough to play and she went on about the usual mother armuments and added teacher ones to boot. He was so upset and was crying that he couldn't play his favourite game and even offered to give me the XBOX 1 back. We were both very upset. In the end I gave up arguing and felt really bad that I had done this to him.

I think I'm a dick for not thinking about the fact he shares a room with a 6 YO step brother and The fact that I didn't ask his mam if he could have an 18 YO game in the house. In fact I got him 3 18 yo games and one U game FIFA 16 which he already had for the 360. Anyway the light at the end of the tunnel is he might be able to play overwatch as it's a 13+ but his go to game will always be Rainbow 6 Seige when he comes to see me. Anyway I feel I have failed as a Dad for bringing up so high then setting up for an upsetting fall :( I just wish things different I'm sure he doesn't get effected by the violence and just sees what most of us see a fun competitive shooter. I hate age ratings and I don't see any difference between the violence overwatch and the volence of seige apart from the blood and that its more realisitic.  Has anyone else had a simlar experience to me? Have I failed as a dad :( feelsbadman",technology,1479632355

personalfinance,Student Loans: Which IBR Plan? [Info inside],"So I have been reading a ton about the different plans and I still cannot figure out which one is best for me, so I figured I'd ask for some help.

Federal Loans: $41,000; Effective Interest Rate: 5.15%

Private Loans: $24:000; Effective Interest Rate: 0%

2015 AGI: $19,075

Estimated 2016 AGI: $50,000

Right now, I'm stuck in a limbo position between my degree and licensure in the field where I'll be working. Once I get out of limbo, I'll be moved from hourly to a salary position of about $80,000 (with bonuses its difficult to predict exactly). The uncertainty of my salary is what concerns me, so I'll just let you know where my thought process is.

On it's face, it seems like REPAYE is my best option. This will drop my monthly payment from $418/month to $10/month using my 2015 tax return. This would mean that the government will pick up 50% of the unpaid interest accruing on my loans. My plan is to start directing payments of about $400/month to the high interest loans over and above the required $10/month.

The drawback of this plan is if my salary were to increase to the $80,000 before I was able to switch out of REPAYE because there is no cap on payments under this plan, whereas the other plans are capped at the standard repayment amount.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Feel free to ask any questions that would help.",finance,1479657092

I currently do not have anything saved other than ~1k, and use a part time job I am working now for gas and groceries and helping my parents out.

 I have approximately $13,800 in federal student loans with interest rates average 4% (3 subsidized from 3.5-4.8%, and 2 unsubsidized both at 4.3%), and a Sallie Mae loan for $2,200 with only $125.19 in interest so far with an interest rate of 8%. I have one credit card from Sallie Mae, and I only use it for gas and groceries and pay it off every month in full. According to them, I have a FICO credit score of 730. The loans will be my only source of debt after I graduate. I will be living at home for the first month or two after graduation.

We will be staying in the same area (95% likely) for the next 10+ years. Renting in the area will be anywhere from 1k-1.3k a month.

I got my first degree about 4 years ago, and now am going back to school for a field I will actually make money in and love. I am currently going to school full-time and will be for another year. So far I have managed to get all of my schooling paid for with minimal debt ($2700 in federal loans). Unfortunately I had to leave my job this year to focus on school. So I have literally burned through all of my savings and cash. I will have to take out big loans to finish school next year (~$50,000). Which will be worth it for me in the end and I am ready to take that step. I was actually thinking of cashing out my retirement ($6000), so I could use it for rent and living for the next few months. It is the only savings I have, but if I need to I will use them. I am wondering if it is better to use my retirement or get a private loan? I know I will probably have to take one anyways, but wouldn't it be better to have less interest accrued? 

Also, does anyone have experience with FAFSA? Since it is my second degree, I haven't had any of it paid for by grants. Even though I made under $30,000 last year, I still got no grants. This year I made under $15,000, so do you guys think I will be eligible to receive grants for a private school?

I know I need my birth certificate and social security card, but I don't know what else. A friend of mine has offered to rent me a room for very cheap, but I do not have a job. Part of that is thanks to my mother not letting me get one. She is a single mother with a low income so she has been getting public assistance, and her argument was that any income I make would be taken out of the benefits, so I would be working for nothing. I am not sure if this holds any weight.

I am a full-time student enrolled in a private university, but scholarships and grants allow me to attend for just over $1k a semester.

personalfinance,"Buying a (used) super car, is my plan reasonable?","After taxes / 401k / insurance / etc; I take home 5600 / month, 100k/ year.


I'm 23, I've been working in my field for 4 years.


I do not pay rent since I live at home. (I moved back after being away for 4 years to take care of an ill family member, please do not comment on my status of living at home.)


I just paid off all my debt except 5k left on my current car. Just finished paying my student loan debt!


I have about 15k cash, 15k in 401k. 


So since I don't pay rent, my monthly costs look like this:


Food / gas / entertainment / misc : 1500 (this was the maximum I've spent in a month over the past 4 years)


Current car payments: 300 / month


Current Car Insurance: 200 / month


So after everything, I'm taking home 3,600 / month. 


Now for a used super car (I know about reliability / depreciation / etc) I'm looking between 60k(older high-ish mileage Audi R8) - 80k(Older ferrari / Lambos) and I'm prepared for maintenance costs since I have other cars at my house in case the engine craps out and I need to save for a few months+ to get it repaired.


I've done some quotes online (putting 15k down), and for 60k car over 72 months and around 2.5-3.5% interest rates, I can get the payment down to ~750-800 / month. Obviously, the 80k loan looks a bit more expensive and I'd rather not go that high (~1000ish+ / month)


Insurance costs will be about 150-300 month for the cars (depending on which) I'm looking at so not too much of a difference from my current one.


So, lets say I put the $5,500 / year into my IRAs, and I put the max into my 401k(1,500 / month)


$458 / month + $1500 / month = ~$2000


$3,600 (after current car and monthly costs) - $2000 (retirement max) - $1000ish (car) 


Leaves me with $600 a month to put away per month just for me. 


Obviously, I can sell my current car, and that saves me another $500 / month leaving me with a total of $1100 / month to put away.


What are your thoughts on my plan? Would it be irresponsible to spend ~1k / month on a car instead of rent?


Also, at least I'm putting my equity into something (a car vs. rent), even if it is depreciating. I know that logic may not fly around here, but that's my thoughts, and I'm looking for advice / suggestions / feelings about my logic :)",finance,1479680720

I had just moved to MN two years earlier with my fiance. Because of all of this I went into a depression and let lots of things in my life lapse and fall behind. I stopped working for a while and the breakup involved a child and custody became a legal battle.

I'm just looking for advice on what to do. I'm 35, as of 2 years ago had a 750 credit score and now it's about 550. I make about 40k a year at my job, about half of which is in cash tips. I travel around a lot throughout the year. My job is mostly in Georgia, but I also work summers in Colorado (I'm a golf caddy). So I live in Georgia 7 months a year, Colorado 3 months, and Minnesota (to see my daughter) for 2 months a year. I may move back to MN for good as it's too hard being away from her and traveling is expensive. 

Anyway...
As of right now my debt is as stands:

American Express CC- $4,000, has gone to collections

Discover CC - $4,000, has gone to collections

Chase CC - $2500, has gone to collections

Custody Lawyer - $2000, she just served me with a court summons on this amount in Minnesota where the custody battle took place. I was wholly unhappy with her service and paid her over $5,000 but she says I still owe here $2,000. I got a call today from my ex (who im on good terms with now) that someone stopped by and served a summons for me to appear in court on this amount Nov.28th...I'm in Georgia...and it says if I'm not there they can issue a bench warrant? yeesh...

$5,000 Federal taxes - My ex and I claimed my daughter as a dependent the year we broke up. IRS asked us both for more paperwork. I never got the request and my ex did. She sent what they wanted and they ruled for her...now my debt. I'm assuming they will garnish my wages soon...

$3,000+ Car title loan - This one hurts the most. At my lowest I got one of those sleazy car-title loans in Wisconsin (as it's illegal in MN) for $1700 on my car. I had intentions of paying it off quick but did not come into the money I was expecting and the fees ballooned so fast the payoff was more than what my car was worth. This was about a year ago and I updated the tags on the car and it has insurance. I'm in Georgia now and still have the car. I'm not sure what I can do here. It's my only mode of transportation.

So as you can see, I'm in a mess. I'm ready to climb out of it and I know it's going to take a lot of work and discipline. Does anyone recommend bankruptcy? How much would that help? Am I screwed on the summons in MN? Any and all help is welcome. It's embarrassing to type this out but all I can do is face it head on and rebuild. I'm leaning towards bankruptcy as it's there for a reason and honestly after all I've been through I wouldn't feel guilt using it.",finance,1479693703

Here are a couple things I found worth noting:

From [Kiss Trust](http://www.kisstrust.com/maximizeFASFA.htm) 

&gt; **What does the FAFSA Handbook say About Trusts?**
&gt; 
&gt; The FAFSA Handbook provides: 

&gt; Trust funds in the name of a student, spouse, or parent should be reported as that person’s asset on the application”

&gt; Note: Such a trust, as described above, would be a Grantor Trust as defined under Internal Revenue Code Sections 671-678. Kiss Trust is NOT a Grantor Trust. 

&gt; Maximizing Financial Aid - Omit Reporting the Trust on FAFSA

&gt; Kiss Trust is NOT a Grantor Trust. Thus, the assets of a Kiss Trust are not held in the name of the student, spouse or parent and as such need not be reported on the FAFSA according to the FSA Handbook.  Every Kiss Trust is an irrevocable 3rd Party trust as defined by federal statute 42 U.S.C. ch 7. and the associated regulations: POMS SI 01120.201. This establishes that the assets of 3rd Party trusts are not considered available assets or income of the Beneficiary.

investing,My growth stock portfolio for 2017. Predicting a 50%+ gain overall. My reasoning included.,"My growth stock portfolio will be $60K, expecting a return of 50%+, so will be expecting to be at least $90K by end of next year. 

Here are my picks:
$GM
$AUPH
$RSXJ
$RSX
$AMD (will add January 2017 after Fed rate hike)
$NVDA (will add January 2017 after Fed rate hike)
$TSLA (a big maybe, will add January 2017 if it dips to around $150; if not then I will not buy)
$MTL

Reasoning:
$GM - Trump loves $GM despite what he said about his concerns regarding overseas manufacturing. $GM has better financials compared to $F and $TSLA and with new electric car lineup like the 2017 Chevy Bolt Electric, I think $GM is due for a bull run soon (which has already started). 

$AUPH - Voclosporin will most likely be approved in 2017, and this stock has a 117%+ upside potential according to the median analyst's estimates if this indeed does go through as planned. There is no reason for this not to happen unless voclosporin causes patient deaths, which the last study did not attribute to. 

$RSXJ and $RSX- With Trump's presidency, sanctions against Russia will gradually be loosened. I don't expect a dramatic loosening of sanctions as the GOP will be cautious. However, I do predict a much better relationship between the US and Russia with Trump in power as opposed to Obama/Hillary. $RSXJ has more growth stock holdings like $AFLT and $MTL, whereas $RSX has more blue chips like $OGZPY, which should improve more dramatically as oil prices rise after the OPEC meeting. 

$AMD - This is a bit of a gamble but I do think that a favorable product line-up in 2017 will boost AMD's market share in both CPUs and CPUs. AMD is mainly concentrating in capturing more market share from Intel and Nvidia at this stage, rather than investing in new growth engines. 

$NVDA - This will probably undergo some corrections by the time the Fed raises rates. I'm expecting a 5% pullback and this will be a good entry point. NVDA just has too much momentum going for it, with AI and driverless cars. 

$TSLA - Tesla has a chance to be a real growth stock if Trump takes a lighter stance on the company's inclination to green energy (solar power). Very much a dark horse ATM, but seeing how advanced its driverless car technology is, I really don't see it falling below $150 unless Trump's policies ruins the industry. 

$MTL - A Russian ADR which will see continuous explosive growth through 2017 if the Russian economy does grow as forecast. Expect more infrastructure as Russia gets back on track to improving the economy rather than fighting in Crimea and the Middle East.

- SocGen has described long EUR/JPY as an attractive long term trade

- Bank of America has described long EUR/JPY as the best relative value trade going into 2017

I don't think I can give exact details of the trades Credit Suisse, and Morgan Stanley took, but I took a long matching what Morgan Stanley took, for the following reasons: 

1. Morgan Stanley is the best performing bank on efxplus over the last two years (I know past results don't indicate future results, but still a good sample size)

2. I find that my own independent conclusions usually are in agreement with Morgan Stanley's conclusions when they are revealed

3. I don't disagree with this trade, it wasn't one that I was looking for, but not one that I have ruled out. 

Risks to this trade: There are political risks coming up in Europe, with elections and such. It could drive EUR bearish, and JPY bullish",finance,1479737326

I make about 33k per year before taxes. my main credit card (Chase Freedom) is holding a balance of about 10k/$10,500. this has been pretty steady for the past year or so and hasnt dropped below 9,000 for maybe 2 years. my minimum monthly payments are around $180.

I have a few other credit cards: Best Buy: 1500/2500, Discover: 600/750, Citi American Airlines: 2500/2700 and am financing a vehicle @ 266/month. The only other major monthly expense i have is the insurance for the car, which is about $190. I currently live with my parents, but will likel have to move out around this time next year - main reason that I am beginning to sweat. My past carelessness is catching up and i'm not sure what to do. most of the debt I've collected was before I was 20 and didnt fully grasp the consequences of my actions.. (yes, I have been carrying much of this a long time..). This is not including my federal loan debt, which is currently being deferred as I am enrolled in University. I dont have a number for that at the moment. 

So I am basically drowning and am not sure what course to take. Should I get a loan to consolidate all of my debt and pay that off? how does that work? is there a secret grant from the government for people that make stupid decisions? or should i cut my losses and become a drifter?

in all seriousness, I am an idiot and I need help. please let me know if any more info is necessary.

Currently I have private loans from Wells Fargo; one for $8k at ~7% and the other at $1k at ~ 4.75. Over the past 4 years the $8k Loan has accrued around $2,160 in interest while the $1k Loan has accrued $170.


My question is trying to figure out how much I should be shelling out each month to pay them off (I make around $2,500 per month post taxes and still live at home with no other major expenses). I should also mention the interest is calculated every 3 months. 


One plan was to pay $800 from now up until next October/ November but that would cause me to pay more in interest.


Another plan was to pay $1,300 to $1,600 per month to get it over with (probably by April/ May/ June).

personalfinance,Were Bernie Madoff's Ponzi funds returns really that ludicrous?

The average year return rate is 12% a year, or, 1% a month.

While this might be excessive in the United States, countries like Brazil, with a gigantic interest rate (credit card rates are 16%. A month. Yeah.) may operate with such a liquidity that government debt and interest rate indexed investments are considered safe AND reach these numbers of 12% a year EASILY.

If you look at the general offerings from ""Itau Bank"" from Brazil, you'll see return rates for low risk investments in 12 months (column labeled ""12 meses"") that often exceed 12%. Some speculative stock funds, albeit extremely risky (some based on state-driven oil companies like Petrobras, which I would not dare to get close) get over 40%. Here it is:  https://www.itau.com.br/personnalite/investimentos/rentabilidade-de-investimentos/

(Do keep in mind that, albeit a 1% return for post-indexed investment funds that are based on government debt and interest rates are common, the inflation rate is roughly 0.6% a month in average, thus ""eating"" part of the profits - the liquid return is often 0.4 or 0.5%, sometimes losing to inflation - yeah Brazil is insane)

I'm going back and forth if it is worth it to sell off the stocks outright and have the end of my student loan debt easily within reach by next year. My only hesitation is that the stock has a historical yield of about 5%, growing faster than a few of my loans. While this does not make a lot of mathematical sense, the idea of getting this debt off my plate and freeing up an additional $400 to put into my roth is quite appealing.

Bitcoin,Why Satoshi left us an impenetrable hierarchy: The problem with pure democracy,"**The Role of the Union Versus Factions**

James Madison explains in [The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp) that one of the many significant advantages to the Union is the 'tendency to break and control the violence of faction'.

He opens with the admission, that we all often share a common complaint:

&gt;Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.

Madison further defines his use of the word 'faction':

&gt;By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

**Defense and Responses to Factions**

Madison outlines two methods of alleviating the 'mischiefs of faction' and to methods of removing the cause of factions:

&gt;There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.

&gt;There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.

Removing its causes, he explains would be to remove liberty (whereas the purpose of government, to secure liberty, in the first place):

&gt;It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.

In regard to 'giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests' Madison suggests this would be 'as impracticable as the first would be unwise':

&gt;As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.

Madison favors diversity it seems for the same reason that Adam Smith or Richard Dawkins might appreciate specialization and division of labor. He highlights a natural tendency among a society to have differing and contrasting view-conflict is natural and therefore expected:

&gt;The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good

Historically the battle for property has been the battle for wealth:

&gt;So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property.

And so Madison expounds further to show how we can begin to reach towards impartiality:

&gt;No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens?

He makes a great and unarguable point 'the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail':

&gt;And what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail.

And so he has laid the cause for the great caution and problem of the inevitable and naturally occurring phenomenon-the faction.

&gt;The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its EFFECTS.

Madison then has skillfully shown that the 2 causes quoted previously cannot be the “cure” for the problem of factions and so now he looks to the possibility of controlling the effects of a faction arising.

First in regard to a small faction Madison notes the majority will keep the faction in check:

&gt;If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution.

In regard to a majority faction:

&gt;When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that ...

&gt;...it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.

On the weakness of morals and religious motives:

&gt;By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.

Furthermore, democracy can be shown to not address the problem of a faction:

&gt;From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.

The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are:

&gt;Delegating government to a smaller group of citizens is seen as an advantage of a republic. 

The second advantage is that such a system of the latter is able to scale to larger groups:

&gt;...first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.

The idea is that the citizenry will elect the collective choice:

&gt;The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for the purpose.

We might consider the possibility the elected official would defect from the public's intentions:

&gt;On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the people.

Two considerations arise:

&gt;The question resulting is, whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious considerations:

The first that the republic fall within a range of a certain minimum ('in order to guard against the cabals of a few ') and a certain maximum amount of participants (' in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude.'):

&gt;In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude.

Madison uses logic to show that a small republic presents 'a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice:

&gt;Hence, the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.

But also that with a larger republic 'a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates...”:

&gt;In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters.

There is an admission of complexity that WAS attended to:

&gt;It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.

It is through the complexity of differing views that the division of the Union into states present which impedes factions from arising:

&gt;The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary.

For these reasons Madison points out that both a small and large republic are superior over a democracy:

&gt;Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the States composing it.

He concludes with some questions and answers. Note security is a main consideration:

&gt;Does the advantage consist in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not be denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely to possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the Union, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the Union gives it the most palpable advantage.

&gt;The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.

Stability is created by the stalemate of multiple conflicting 'political' perspectives:

&gt;A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire State.

A republic cures an ailment that democracy cannot:

&gt;In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of Federalists.",cryptocurrency,1479760323
personalfinance,Got married. Is there a nuts and bolts list of the paperwork we need to get in order?,"Hey PF,

After delaying far too long trying to placate various warring factions with irreconcilable positions on how a wedding should be conducted and paid for, myself and my wife(wow. still getting used to that!) got hitched over the weekend in a small ceremony surrounded by a few of our closest friends and family.  Long time reader and occasional writer on an alternate account because various friends and family follow my main account and this was a covert operation.



**This isn't a request for info about stuff we should consider before we get married.**  There's plenty of good info about how to prepare, and we followed that advice already.  We're actually in good shape as far as ""stuff to get on the same page on before you decide to get married.""  We've spent years talking about life goals, financial goals, etc.  We're agreed on how we want to retire.  We've had full transparency with one another as how as how are finances look for several years now.  We're on track for saving, how we pay bills, etc.  We're DINKS and committed to remaining so.  We worked out the impact of filing jointly long before we tied the knot (its minimal, +/- 0.1%).    Basically except for the legal arrangement itself, with its associated tax status and other rights and responsibilities of being married, we've been living as if we were married for several years now.  

**What I am really looking for is a nuts an bolts list of everything we have to go update now.**  There's dozens, if not hundreds of finance related things all over the place that have a box for marital status that has us on record as single.   A lot are easy to guess what they are, but I'm sure there are others we wouldn't think of, or even know about.

Obviously, if something happened to one of us, the fact that we are married would override a lot of things during probate, but we want to get them all in order anyway.  What are those things that need to be updated.  Which need to be updated ASAP?  What can wait?


Extra details:

 * For the last several years, if we had the option to select a beneficiary while updating or creating some new account, we were already putting the other down as the beneficiary.

 * One of us owns the house we live in with a mortgage solely in their name.  Agreed intent of both parties is to leave the ownership and mortgage as is until such time that either we sell the house or interest rates are such that it makes financial sense to refinance it.

 * Nobody is changing their name.  We're both well established in our careers and fields.  A name change at this point for either of us would be ridiculous.

 * We have no joint bank accounts.  We don't really need one, but we might open one at a bank neither of us has other accounts at so we can more easily commingle funds.







Finance I've thought of so far that might probably need something updated:

 * Bank accounts 
 * Investment accounts
 * IRAs/401ks/Misc retirement accounts
 * Life insurance policies
 * Health insurance
 * Car/House/Umbrella insurances (We have shared policies for all of those now, but our status to one another has changed)

Other stuff

 * Our employers probably need to know explicitly beyond updating things directly with our health insurances we get through them.
 * We need to get proper wills written by a proper attorney.  Can we ethically share an attorney for that as were now married?",finance,1479760751

personalfinance,Returning inheritance to mother-in-law. It was her money to begin with and gave it up in a divorce with a bad husband.,"We have a fairly uncommon scenario, so I'm having trouble finding advice online.

My mother-in-law was the primary breadwinner for 30 years, owns a very lucrative small business, and had a disabled husband. He was previously the primary breadwinner until irresponsible behavior made him disabled, and she had to become the primary breadwinner while still taking care of the house and kids (because ""that's women's work""). He never worked, despite being able, because he was ""a broken man."" After 30 years of what became clear abuse, she finally got fed up and divorced him. Because he's disabled, the divorce process would have favored him heavily if he had lawyered up, and so that he wouldn't she made him a very generous offer and payment. The basics are:

- 50% ownership of 80 acres of land (where he currently lives in a camper)
- 50% ownership of a family cabin (passed down in family, but she paid a lot to have it completely rebuilt some years back)
- A million dollars
- An annual income (alimony) of something like $150,000


Now, barely a month past the divorce being final, he finds out he has a life-threatening aneurysm, multiple tumors (not yet confirmed cancerous, but one is very probable), and kidney cysts. Between his regiment of prescription opiates, pot use, and alcohol, he could never tell if he had legitimate pain or wasn't feeling well, and he avoided doctors as much as possible, and he does absolutely nothing to take care of his health, so he never knew he was in such poor condition. Everyone expected him not to last long, due to his lifestyle and general health, but the turnaround between signing away assets to him in divorce and potential mortality are ridiculously short. 

We're waiting on multiple medical tests to find out the prognosis, and my SO is both very stressed and ambivalent over the possibility of a greatly disliked parent's possible death, but we're both of one mind in that the money belongs to her. As we understand the contents of his will, my SO and SO's sibling will equally inherit from him. I don't think the mother-in-law would want us to give her back the share of the cabin property, but we can't in good conscience keep the money she earned. If mother-in-law wants SO to inherit when she dies, then that's perfectly fine.

They live in Texas, we live in Texas, the 80 acres is in Texas, the cabin property is in Arkansas.

Is there a way to give this money back to her without a massive tax penalty? Are there other things we can do with this money that might be to her benefit? I'm not entirely sure, but I believe both jointly owned properties are fully paid off, otherwise I would suggest putting the money toward that.  
Also, will this fuck up our taxes? We're currently living in a small house on 1 income of $50,000 while our son is small. We're 30.",finance,1479761043

stocks,I can't believe people are still buying US stocks at all-time highs. Buy Russia instead!,"US stocks are at all-time highs. Why are people repeating the same mistakes as 2007//2008?

The Russian stock market is different. It may be trading at all-time highs but its economy is expected to return to growth in 2017 and it has already begun its bull run. 

ETFs like RSX and RSXJ have gained 93% and 105% respectively this year alone. Industrial stocks like $MTL have gained 300%+ in 2017. 

You guys might be saying ""How can you say that the US stock market wont go higher?"" 

Yes, it might. However all indicators are suggesting that investors are hesitant to buy at the new record-highs and the weekly doji candle suggests hesitancy in the markets. And with the December interest rates striking soon, this could be another 10% drop we saw earlier this year and maybe even 20% or 50%. 

Again, I'm not saying that this will happen. The markets may go up higher. But upside potential is limited IMO. 

Russian ETFs and ADRs are a better choice in this market climate. These ETFs and ADRs are listed on the US stock exchange and can be traded like any other shares/ETFs.

However, you can see the fatal flaw in u/brg444's arguments when you notice that is tacitly assuming that *his buddies at Core/Blockstream should be allowed to determine the blocksize (and 1 MB just happens to be the right ""magic"" number).*

As we know, the current ""1 MB"" blocksize was just a random accident of history - a temporary anti-spam kludge which everyone expected would be removed:

- [Satoshi explained how it would be removed](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3wo9pb/satoshi_nakamoto_october_04_2010_074840_pm_it_can/);

- [Greg Maxwell u/nullc (CTO of Blockstream), Adam Back u/adam3us (CEO of Blockstream), and u/theymos (owner of r\bitcoin) were also fine with it being removed](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5dtfld/previously_greg_maxwell_unullc_cto_of_blockstream/).

Then in late 2014, along came that [""shitty startup"" Blockstream](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59hcvr/blockstream_is_just_another_shitty_startup_a/) - getting $76 million in funding from [some of the most powerful companies in the legacy world of ""fiat finance""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) - [paying off most of the Core devs](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5dtfld/previously_greg_maxwell_unullc_cto_of_blockstream/) - attempting to hijack the Bitcoin codebase to serve the agenda of their corporate masters - leading to artificially [high fees](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=fee+market&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), periodic and worsening [congestion](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=congestion&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and delays - which is [suppressing Bitcoin's price, adoption and market cap](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=e%3Dmc^2&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

As people like u/jessquit have [recently started pointing out](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5e4grt/ujessquit_to_unullc_youre_so_fucking_shameless/da9qad4/?context=1), we now know that Blockstream's business plan is 100% dependent on two things:

- [Preventing Bitcoin from ever having a ""full node referendum"" (also known as ""hard forking"" or ""voting"")](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5e410j/negotiations_have_failed_bscore_will_never_hf/);

- Preventing Bitcoin from doing native, on-chain scaling - so they can force people into their non-existent off-chain vaporware solutions (Lightning Network).

We also know that u/brg444 previously worked for a ""viral marketing"" firm in Canada. Now he's putting his propaganda talents to use to serve the agenda of Blockstream's corporate masters:

- *overtly* making nice *reasonable-sounding* arguments *against* letting miners control blocksize

- while also *covertly* making a *batshit-insane* argument *in favor of* letting his buddies at Blockstram arbitrarily freeze the blocksize at the pathetically tiny, empirically rejected size of 1 MB.

Because u/brg444 posted his article in [a subreddit which is notorious for heavy-handed corporate censorship](https://np.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/5djn13/rhailcorporate_condemns_rbitcoin_for_censorship/), I thought it would be useful to cross-post it here, so we could have a more open discussion, since anything critical of Core/Blockstream would probably get deleted in that other subreddit.

To start the discussion off, here's an earlier comment by u/Noosterdam which actually happens to pre-emptively destroy u/brg444's implicit argument - reminding us that Blockstream simply pulled the ""1 MB"" number out of their ass, while empirical studies (such as [the Cornell study](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4cq8v0/new_cornell_study_recommends_a_4mb_blocksize_for/)) have shown that the network could *definitely* handle blocks of at least **4 MB** - and possibly much bigger:

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5dxe42/i_am_a_longtime_btc_hodler_since_2010_this_is/da9pmkk/?context=1

&gt; The only academic study I've seen puts a floor of 4MB as the minimum size where exceeding it could cause any problems. It's only a study to determine a lower bound, i.e., ""the network could safely support at least this big of blocks."" That says nothing about 10 or 100MB blocks being a problem.

&gt; And remember that's the current network, with Bitcoin being only as big of a deal as it is now. By the time we have 10MB blocks, Bitcoin will be a much bigger deal and far more economically important, so many more people and businesses will want to be running nodes. And by the time we are craving 100MB blocks, all the more so.

&gt; Eventually we hit a limit where off-chain scaling starts to be a worthwhile tradeoff, but we have no reason to believe that point is even in the ballpark of 1MB. It would be a spectacular coincidence it if were, and yet this is what we're asked to believe. Most of all, to even calculate where that tradeoff would be, you would need to provide a [minimum node spec](http://www.coindesk.com/how-to-save-bitcoins-node-network-from-centralization/) you want the network to maintain support for. So far I don't know that even that first step has been done, so it's constant moving goalposts.

So... be careful when reading posts by u/brg444. He works in for a ""viral marketing firm"" so he's got a lot of training in Public Relations in order to make soothing, ""reasonable-sounding"" arguments to manipulate people's opinion to get them to submit to the agenda of his corporate masters at Blockstream.

- His *explicit* arguments against *allowing miners to unilaterally increase the blocksize* are perfectly reasonable, and can and should be discussed further.

- His *implicit* (nowhere stated) arguments that ""we need a blocksize limit and 1 MB is the right magic number"" are totally unfounded and manipulative - just his usual bullshit and propaganda and psy-ops - trying to [prevent you from voting](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5e410j/negotiations_have_failed_bscore_will_never_hf/), using psy-ops to try and make you forget that [Bitcoin is essentially *about* voting](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5e410j/negotiations_have_failed_bscore_will_never_hf/da9r33j/?context=2) - all so that [his corporate masters at Blockstream can stay in power](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=hard+fork+blockstream&amp;restrict_sr=on) and hijack Bitcoin and force people onto [their centralized off-chain ""solutions""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=lightning+routing&amp;restrict_sr=on).",cryptocurrency,1479779291

**Debts**:Student loan with $53,500 outstanding as of End of Nov 2016, Interest rate is 3.2% locked with a term remaining of 8 years 9 months, minimum payment each month is $594, currently paying $600 to make myself feel a touch better

**Savings**: I've saved about $2,000 as an emergency fund, but know this isn't enough as I should shoot to have three months expenses worth, or roughly $7,500

**Retirement**: Currently offered by company a 4% payment with 4% match that I am doing, was told once that I should be shooting for 10%, figure being off 2% and putting it towards student loans is fine for the time being. 

**Monthly Expenses**: This is one I am particularly proud of, I've been extremely stingy on my bills taking advantage of everything I can with Rent excluded due to living in a big city. 

Rent: $1850/mth

personalfinance,How to deal with the $150k debt I'm about to inherit?,"10 years ago my mother asked me to co-sign a home equity loan for 100k because she was having health issues and needed money. She assured me that she would repay the loan and she only needed me because a co-signer was required. I agreed and went in to sign the document. She recovered and was I was made aware that she was paying off the loan. 

3 years ago, I ran a credit check on myself and discovered that there was a 100k loan in our name. I thought there was a mistake because there was no way it was still at 100k because she was paying it off! I immediately brought it to her attention and she flipped out and accused me of illegally obtaining fiancal information on her. It was a red flag, but I felt guilty because she was going through another health scare so I dropped the issue. 1 year ago she was diagnosed with stomach cancer. 

Now that she only has a few more months to live, she is now sharing with me her fiancials. She makes the monthly minimum ($244) on the laon but there is also a ""periodic fiance charge"" of $244. The interest rate is 2.99%. She is also 50k in credit card debt. In her irrevocable trust my sister and I will inherit her house (may be worth $500,000 but she is a horder and has not maintained the house since the 90s) and maybe 70k if she doesn't spend it all before her death.

personalfinance,Pulling myself together,"Hi Reddit, need some advice and reassurance. 
27 years old, married, recent chapter 7 about 4 months ago. 

I filed chapter 7 because I had a small business that failed and had 25k in debt and no job for 6 months. 

Bills are as follows. $584 car payment, $127 car insurance, $160 cell phone, $90 health insurance and dental. Wife's debt includes $220 and $2700. Wife is currently looking for a job, and is not working. 

I found a new job working as an executive Chauffeur, basically a driver. Paid $15 an hour for specific jobs and $20 flat for transfers from point A to B. Paycheck 1 was $960 after taxes. Paycheck 2 will be $1860 before taxes. The hours and pay are erratic and unstable however it can pay well. 

With the wife not working currently my main goal is to pay down her debts as quickly as possible with my extra income each month. Pretty much to lower how much we owe and increase our savings. After that I want to make larger payments on the car, which is $7k upside down in negative equity and at a 15.8% interest rate. I'm hoping to get her debts squared away quickly, pay off the 7k upside down and hopefully refinance the car into a much lower interest rate. 

My goal is to eventually start a larger savings, and begin a retirement and investment portfolio.

personalfinance,Is it better to apply for a credit card with a bank that you already use?,"I'm 23, two years out of college with no credit history. I don't make much money (~25k/yr) but I live frugally and have no bank or federal loans. I have been thinking recently about getting a credit card so that I can start establishing credit. I've applied for Chase Freedom since I've had a checking account with Chase since high school, but was declined. Reading up on secured cards made me grudgingly decide those were probably the best bet, and I plan to apply for a Capital One Secured Mastercard.

Here's the thing: I already have a checking account with Chase, and a savings account with Schwab, and if all goes well, a line of credit with Capital One-- that's 3 banks. I don't have the financial knowledge to really get why that seems off to me, but I guess I don't like the idea of being spread kind of thinly across multiple different banks. So far using two different banks to differentiate checking/savings hasn't been a problem for me, but I'm not sure if adding another into the mix is smart.

Is what I'm talking about even an issue? Are there any pros/cons associated with using the same/vs. a new bank for opening a line of credit?",finance,1479795689
personalfinance,Found out SO hasn't made CC payments in &gt;2 years. CC debt + unpaid loans have been charged off. Need advice.,"Made a throwaway to maintain anonymity. Like the title says, I found out my SO has some accounts that are seriously delinquent. One is for a credit card that hasn't seen a single payment made on it since summer 2014. The other is for a government 'loan' that he stopped making payments to earlier this year. I put loan in quotes because, long story short, after getting out of the military he received backpay from the government in the form of direct deposit *and* as a check. He deposited the check, and the feds said give it back since he'd essentially received twice what was owed to him. He'd been paying that off until this spring, and hasn't made a payment since. He ignored letter after letter that was mailed out informing him of his outstanding balances. Both accounts have been charged off, and we have no idea to whom.

He hasn't made any charges to his CC since he stopped making payments. I checked his credit report, didn't even bother looking up his score because I assume it's destroyed. He has incurred an incredible amount of interest on his principal credit card balance, though I'm not sure exactly how much since he hasn't logged into his online bank account through his CC's original creditor in years and doesn't remember his login info/account number, etc. He is currently in school under the GI Bill, which means tuition is waived (he'll graduate in 1.5 years), and he gets a monthly housing allowance that helps cover some expenses and isn't federally considered income. Aside from that, he has no job, and no other debt. 

*In total, he has nearly $9,000 in collections.* 

There have been some serious changes since last week, and after a few years of feeling ashamed for hiding this from me, he's feeling relieved that there finally seems to be a path forward.
Finding out about this debt was shocking, but not world ending. I told him in no uncertain terms that this is extremely serious, and after running his credit report, we started making a plan. Briefly, he is to cease all frivolous purchases immediately, and until we figure out how to move forward, he is to pay half of our rent and utilities (of which he has only paid about 1/3 since I became employed last spring while he's still in school), while a portion of his leftover monthly income will go toward slowly building an emergency savings account, and the rest will go towards paying off his debt. Since I can afford it I will take care of miscellaneous expenses. He is going to get a part time job ASAP, and all income from that job will go towards paying off his debt. 


We've moved in the last 8 months, and one of his original creditors (the government) said his debt has been sent to collections and there's nothing they can do to help him further. He has yet to contact his former bank, but I have advised him to read up online about how to deal with collection agencies in the event that he receives a phone from one very soon. We are both eager to have this debt paid off as soon as possible. To be clear, he is adamant about paying this off *himself*. I will not be making payments for him. Rather, I will regularly monitor his spending and very regularly check in on his progress.

**My main questions are in regards to paying off debt that is in collections.** 

*1. His credit report doesn't say who his debt was charged off to - how can we find out who owns it, and who to make payments to?*

*2. Should we try to find out who the collections agency that owns his debt is and reach out to them? Do we wait for the CAs to contact us?*

*3. He has no idea what his account number is for his former bank, let alone online login info - should he call to get that information before moving forward, or just avoid calling them all together until he hears from the CA?*

**Some of my background.** We've been together for several years - we are unmarried and have no kids, do not share any bank accounts, but we do live together and share expenses. We are both in our late twenties. I have about $10k in student loans, but have excellent credit and make it a point to put as much of my monthly income that I can afford toward paying off my loans, which I plan to have paid off within 5 years. I have one credit card with balances that I have paid in full every single month since opening it. I have always been in charge of our monthly bills, and until I landed a well-paying full time job 8 months ago we contributed equally to our shared expenses. I have a diversified retirement plan that I monitor closely and feel very secure about where my money goes and always know how much I have in the bank. I have a graduate degree that I owe no student loans on, and a steady income. 

I'd been meaning to probe further into his financial state a long time ago, but avoided the topic as talking openly about money is very difficult for him. Still, I try to encourage those discussions since we share our lives and expenses with each other. He grew up screening calls to his parents from debt collectors; I grew up saving for college and learning about personal finance from financially literate parents. Our different backgrounds have done much to inform our very different relationships with money as adults. While we both try to be extremely honest and respectful with one another, I know him very well and I understand why he hid this from me, as upsetting as it is. In general we communicate openly with each other and I have no plans to end our relationship. I'd just like to do whatever I can to help him make it through this.

personalfinance,How do I go back to college and do it right this time?,"Hello /r/PersonalFinance,

I need your help. I'm 19 years old and planning on going back to college. This time, I want to do things right. That's why I need your help. I'll do my best to leave no detail left out but, if I fail to do so, please don't hesitate to ask for more information.


From Aug. 2015 - May 2016, I was enrolled in a Community College. There I was on the Dean's List both semesters and was finding success in my major. However, here's where the problem began. I was a Criminal Justice student and enjoyed the material for the most part while I was there. However, after the dust of the final exams settled in May, I was left thinking ""CJ is not for me"" and ""Being a cop is not what I want to do for the rest of my life"".

Thus began the summer and the job hunt began. Luckily, I was able to find a job in a distribution center making pretty decent money for an 18 y.o. (approx. $1800 a month). Then, towards the end of July I was left with a burning question, ""Do I want to go back to college?"" and I decided not to for multiple reasons, but the main contributor was the fact that I was not happy in my major and had no backup majors set in my mind. 

So here I am, over $4,000 in my bank account (and that number will only go up until the week before I leave for school) and a $5000 loan through Great Lakes that still has not had a payment made on it. I plan on applying and hopefully gaining admission to a state school for the Fall 2017 semester but, until then there are some things that need to be done. 

Here's a list of some questions and POE that I've been wondering or thinking about.

* What do I do as far as paying back my loan?
* Will I still be eligible for FASFA money since have a steady job (for now)?
* If I'm not eligible for FASFA money, how do I pay for school? I know my Credit Union offers student loans at some pretty good interest rates.
* I still need a major. Possibilities are but, not limited to; Fisheries and Wildlife Management, Finance, and History Education.

personalfinance,"i took 6 months off work, and survived!","Hi PF! 



In November last year, I decided that I would take extended time off work to spend time with my long distance (Transpacific) SO in California. I preferred unpaid leave because I believed it’d improve my chances with US Border Control (demonstrate intent to return home), and also since I would rather keep a bird on hand and my options open.



I managed to pull it off without burning a hole in my pocket, so maybe PF will enjoy my tale (all figures in USD)!



**Phase 1: Laying the Groundwork (aka, research and negotiate)**

I’d been working in a fairly large organization, where extended unpaid leave was rare, but did happen. There were no HR guidelines or formal process, so I dug around, speaking to people from HR, people who knew people who tried taking time off. I found out that taking time off “to accompany a spouse overseas on temporary assignment” had a high-hit-rate while bearing the closest resemblance to my own reasons. I also knew that I had some leverage including being generally high performing (and since HR was measured on negative attrition, they had a vested interest in keeping me from leaving).

So I made my request sound as close as I could to the proven narrative, while remaining factually accurate (in effect making it seem that my SO and I may be closer to getting married than we actually are). I also reiterated that I desired to stay and grow with the organization in the long term, but it was also balancing this intent against the shorter-term exigencies of being long distance with my SO (hinting that I would consider resigning as a last resort).

The process of getting support involved multiple conversations with supervisors and bosses, HR and higher levels of HR. It took weeks for me to get the approvals, and many more weeks to lock down an actual period and start date.

In the meantime, I read up on long-term visa options for the US, horror stories about US border control, etc. Alas, my visa bid for a longer-term (6 mth) visa was not granted (embassy staff said I would need to be visiting my family / spouse to qualify), which sent a $200 processing fee down the drain ☹. My only option was to enter the US on an ESTA, which meant staying 90 days at a time, and managing the risk of being denied entry by border control in subsequent visits.



**Phase 2: Making a Plan (aka budget like crazy)**

With a date in clearer sight, I was starting to crap my pants, because holy shit this is happening. I’d never been one for very detailed budgeting and tracking, but I knew this would be an expensive year, with only 4+ months of guaranteed income. On the upside, generally healthy PF habits have left me with no debt, an emergency fund, some money set aside for retirement/investments, and some liquid savings in various high-interest savings accounts. My financial goal was to make it through the year without drawing down on my savings. 

This was how I saw my financial situation:

***Guaranteed income for 2016***: ~$24,000 (4.5 months salary + bonuses from work last year)

***Budget for 2016***: $23,450

***Lumpy Expenses (Annual Budget)***

-	Flights &amp; Related Costs: $4200 (2x long haul return flights)

-	Healthcare: $500

-	Clothes: $350

-	Personal Care &amp; Hobbies: $800

-	Gifts: $500

-	Income Tax: $1000 (my tax is billed after year of assessment)

-	Emergency Fund / Contingency: $2000

	
***Recurring Expenses***

-	Accommodation in the US: $500/mth, 6 mths [SO said I shouldn’t pay for accommodation, but I decided to budget for it anyway]

-	US Phone Line: $30/mth, 6 mths

-	Rent &amp; Phone (Home): $600/mth, 12 mths

-	Food: $200/mth

-	Transport: $60/mth

-	Entertainment: $50/mth



**Phase 3: Hitting the Tracks (pun intended)**

To keep track of my finances, I started an excel workbook with the following itemized and categorized spreadsheets:

-	expenditures 

-	income 

-	holdings


The data from these spreadsheets were summarized and consolidated into a overview page which provided a month by month breakdown of my expenditures, incomes, holdings, tracked my cumulative savings/debt for the year, and gave a rough sense of my overall net worth.



**The Result**
 
***Actual Income for 2016***: $35000 (and ~$4000+ expected in December)

***Actual Budget for 2016*** (extrapolated from 10+ mths actuals): $24,200

***Lumpy Expenses (Total for the year)***

-	Flights &amp; Related Costs: $4500    *(+300 from budget)*

-	Healthcare: $900     *(+400 from budget)*

-	Clothes: $1300    *(+~1000 from budget)*

-	Personal Care &amp; Hobbies: $1500    *(+700 from budget)*

-	Gifts: $1000    *(+500 from budget)*

-	Income Tax: $1200    *(+200 from budget)*

-	Contingency Money: $100


***Recurring Expenses***

-	Accommodation in the US: ~$500/mth, 6 mths *(no change)*

-	US Phone Line: $35/mth, 6 mths *(slightly more than budget)*

-	Rent &amp; Phone (Home): $600/mth, 12 mths *(no change)*

-	Food: $175/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

-	Transport: $55/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

-	Entertainment: $40/mth *(slightly less than budget)*

I ended up keeping fairly close to budget, but splurged a little on some of my discretionary spend, particularly doing some travelling within the US, shopping for cold wear, work clothes, and high quality clothes/shoes for camping, and because I got into gardening. 

In our initial plan, my SO insisted that I should not pay for accommodation, but I had budgeted for it anyway. Along the way, some crazy shit happened but in short his mum became flat broke and homeless, moved into the half of his duplex that was meant for rental out. She stayed rent free and borrowed money. He didn’t want to burden me since I was technically unemployed, so I ended up squirreling money to him through a seemingly neverending stash of cash I had in the house. I also spent less on food, transport and entertainment than expected since we spent a lot of time cooking, cuddling and watching Netflix. 

On the income front, I ended up earning more than projected in part because I didn’t count on returning to work immediately after my break, and also from the following:

-	taking up illustration commissions (~$2,000)

-	interest and dividends (~$2,000)

-	nice relatives who were worried I might run out of money and stuffed me bunches of cash (~$1,000)

-	more bonus than I expected (~$2000)

-	selling stuff (~$200)



**Random things I learnt along the way**

-	Manually keying in expenditures definitely made me a lot more mindful of my spending, and think twice about splurging on things I don’t need. I highly recommend it!

-	Being prepared goes a long way. On my second leg back into the US, the border control officer held me back for a bit since I’d just spent 90 days in the US fairly recently (I buffered 2.5 weeks before returning). But when I whipped out my binder with documentation for every visa guideline (ESTA, flight tickets, travel insurance, employment letter back home, approval of leave dates, last performance appraisal, latest statements of all my savings, retirement and investment accounts, and pictures with my SO, etc.) he was like whoa, ok. I guess you did your homework, and he let me through pretty much immediately.

-	It’s 100% worth spending on items of good quality. During the trip, I got a pair of very good, very waterproof hiking boots ($70, on sale!), and it feels amazing waddling through streams without having to worry about my feet getting wet!

-	Plan using only your guaranteed income, and budget with contingency in the picture. Living the plan gets a lot less stressful when any additional income becomes a bonus, while unexpected emergency expenses are soaked up by your contingency budget.

-	Looking for work in the US is really hard! I tried testing the waters and sent out my resume, customized cover letters, etc. to maybe 50 companies. Most didn’t reply, some rejected me, and I got a grand total of two (informal) interviews from companies that weren’t actually keen to consider me at all (cause of visa), but thought my CV was interesting enough to meet me. Welp!

-	It feels pretty damn good to be on the airline priority list. It is an inexplicable joy exiting a long haul flight and seeing your luggage be one of the first out on the belt. If you fly often, don’t forget to sign up on a frequent fliers program and be sure to claim your miles. 

-	Sometimes life sucks and you just have to deal with it. ☹ Prior to my rejection at the US Embassy, I had tried calling them, and emailing them to clarify the visa eligibility and guidelines specific to my situation, but they gave unhelpful and non-committal replies that neither affirmed nor denied my eligibility, and stated that I should make an appointment with a visa officer who could better assess my request. Unfortunately the Embassy is not like a place where you can call in to demand that they process a refund / fee waiver.



**TL;DR**: I took six months off work to spend time with my long distance SO in the US. The goal was to be budget neutral this year. I made it through with net savings of $10,000, while picking up new hobbies (gardening), great experiences in the American outdoors, and some pretty cool learning points relating to budgeting, planning, employment, immigration and being prepared in general. 


*edited for formatting*

EDIT: 

Holy crap, i woke up this morning and my inbox was totally flooded. I've been responding to comments, but am back home from work and can do a proper update. 


1) Several of you asked if some of the things I did were legal. I clarified this in some of my responses. Basically, I did my best to research as much as possible, keep within the legal limits of what my visa type allowed me to do, and err on the side of caution when in doubt. For instance, taking on commissions only in my home country, keeping most job hunting activities outside of the US, and returning home with some buffer during the course of 6 months so I did not overstay. When in the US, I didn't work, but I did try a bit to fish around for possible future work opportunities. As I definitely did not wish to run afoul of immigration policy, I kept any job-related enquiries general, informal and exploratory, while caveating my emails / letters with my visa situation and how I was open to exiting and entering the country on a different visa if they would sponsor me on a valid employment visa. 

2) Some were curious as to how I eventually tracked my budgets and 'kept to plan'. There's a lot of very personal information in my 2016 sheet that I don't feel comfortable sharing, but here's a cleaned up version of the spreadsheet I made, with some placeholder info in each of the tabs to show how it works. The overview page is automatically populated by subsequent spreadsheets [Spreadsheet here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uuyj3JQrkj-wWdOz6VOzvE5sLGBHrcRrTN_RFU1LlHo)

3) A few mentioned that you are in a similar long distance relationship with someone in a different country, and would like to do something similar in future. I thought that you might find a cleaned up version of my projection spreadsheet, with placeholder information useful, though you may need some excel knowledge to customise it for your specific purpose. [projection template here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X6ThpIFXEfo-kB0iob_Xiq4U3K5NBl9Z7xwHdg-Pe1Q).

I had always intended to refinance, but life got in the way, and over the last year I never got around to it. We all know that now rates are at 52-week highs (in fact, several year highs) as the markets try and digest Trump's presidency. When I looked a few days ago, we were playing with 4.1, now we're already up to 4.25. The Fed has been talking about raising rates, and making it sound like it is coming in the short term.

I know this is asking about reading tea leaves, but does anyone have any good insight (or articles) on deciding whether now is a good time to refinance or whether its worth the risk to push this down the road. Our rate won't adjust for another 9 years.

I figured since this is a more macro level discussion (as opposed to daily/weekly/monthly lock discussions) people here may have some insight that was worth keeping out of the megathread.

personalfinance,Eliminating PMI,"Hi,

I recently purchased a multi family home using an FHA loan. At the time of purchase the loan to value ratio is 77%. I expect this has gone up even in the last few months.

My initial plan was to do a cash out re-finance in the spring to eliminate the PMI and get some $ for renovations. With talk of interest rates going up (they already have a bit) I'm wondering if it makes more sense to try and get the bank to eliminate PMI early instead and then take out an equity line.

My FHA rate is 3.5 and cash out re-fi rate was 3.5 when I closed, but now has gone up into the 4's. I can secure a 15 year equity line at 4% right now. 

Any advice? My main concern is the PMI over the other things. I can deal with $$ aspects of renovations later. Is it even possible to get rid of the PMI within 6 months of getting an FHA loan?

Thanks!

Edit: Several people have asked this. We went FHA because of the downpayment options. Don't want to go into too much detail as I forgot to post this with a throwaway. The intent was to Re-Fi in 6 months anyway as we knew we had instant equity. With rates creeping up now, i'm not sure it'll be worth it to re-fi anymore.",finance,1479832905

personalfinance,Are there any worthwhile mortgages you can get with less than 20% down payment and not have to pay PMI?,"I'm asking about this to give advice to my friend, but I'm going to share my own situation first to explain why I'm asking. I don't want him to end up in the same situation I'm in.

I purchased a house 3 years ago with about 3.5% down (FHA) and I've been paying about $200/month in PMI since then. I am currently in the process of refinancing to a conventional loan now to remove the PMI, but I'll be paying closing costs again and end up with a higher interest rate. (Renovations and gentrification have resulted in my house being worth more now, and I am hoping the appraisal will put me below 80% LTV). It's really my only option because the FHA loan will not drop the PMI until I've paid down to 80% of the original loan amount, and it doesn't matter if I get it appraised and it's worth more. PMI must be paid until I pay down to 80% of the original loan amount. It will take approx. 10 years, so $20,000 in PMI payments. Bad situation, I should have waited to buy a house if I couldn't afford the 20% down payment. Live and learn.

Well now I'm trying to use what I've learned to help my friend. He wants to buy a house but only has about $5,000 to put towards down payment and closing costs. The houses he's interested in would be about $200k, so his down payment would be substantially less than 20%. 

I'm wondering if there are any worthwhile options for someone who has so little for a down payment but wants to buy a house. The mortgage company I used has this [""Zero PMI""](http://www.boulevardmortgagecompany.com/Zero_PMI_Compare.htm) option where you put 3% down and don't have to pay PMI. The interest rate is almost 5% which seemed high to me, but it looks like average interest rates right now are around 4%. The mortgage I just applied for to refinance is 3.5% and that was by far the lowest I found for a 30 year term.

Is something like this a good idea? Are there other options I should tell him about? Down payment assistance programs for first time home buyers? His income is about $55k. Or should he really just keep renting and saving until he can put 20% down?",finance,1479837712

personalfinance,Student loan interest tax deduction. Take advantage before first payment in Jan?,"So my student loans go into repayment in January. I have ~44K in loans with various interest rates and such. My question isn't so much about best way to pay them back because I understand that process, focusing on the higher interest loans first and so on. My question is about the tax deduction. 

I've read enough on it that I know it is not really worth it to chase it each year because it'll most likely just cost me more in the long run. What I was wondering is since I can afford it, should I make 1 big payment this year before I have to start making payments and have it go all towards the interest that accrued on my unsubsidized ones while in school. I know the max for the deduction $2,500, but I wasn't sure if it would be wise to just max out on that just for this year since it would basically be a free payment (I know that's oversimplifying and that it's not exactly free). 

As far as my current tax situation goes, I know I'll be getting money back as it is. I am single (23M) making ~$30K this year(gross). I currently have 0 exceptions on my federal tax so the max is being taken so I know I'll already be getting a good chunk back there. As far as other deductions go, I won't be claimed by my parents so that will help me and I did purchase a new car so I'll be able to claim the tax on that. Otherwise I won't have many others besides the pretax deductions I have on my check, benefits, 401k(8-10%), and my HSA (1,800 for the year). I don't know I whole lot about taxes, but I know some basic stuff. I just do my taxes using TurboTax each year. So I know I'm in a good situation take wise. (I know I'm overpaying to the government when I could be putting that in my own pocket)


As far as my financial situation I'm in a good situation that even making that $2,500 payment won't hurt me at all as I have $10K in my savings/emergency fund. (Before you ask it's in a high interest savings account 1.05% with a bonus 2.5% bonus (of earned interest over 6 months) if I deposit every month for 6 months and another 2.5% (of earned interest over 6 months) if I don't withdraw for 6 months) The only thing I'll lose is the 2nd 2.5% bonus as I would have to with that money otherwise there would be no potential repercussions for making such a large payment. 

As far as other debt goes the only other debt I have is my car loan which is $23K at 2.5% interest. So I know I should focus on my students loans instead of paying extra on my car loan since they have higher interest rates. I have no credit card debt as I have one card that I use just for the cash back benefit and pay it off each month. (I'm rather proud, never paid interest on it. Sorry not trying to gloat.)

My loan payments will be about $125 as I put it on an income driven play as I couldn't afford the 10 year plan with my car payment and other bills. But I will be paying more than the minimum each month as I would like to pay it off as quickly as I can. I will be able to get it back into deferment as I am going to be going back into school (still have a year left) but I am going to continue making payments anyways.


**&lt;tl:dr&gt; Long story short. Is it worth it to make a large interest only payment for this year just so I can claim the deduction essentially getting it back in my return? Or just save it and use it on my payments focusing on paying off the higher interest loans first. &lt;\tl:dr&gt;**

Ask any additional questions. I'd like to think I'm rather financially smart, but I know there is always more to learn.

gaming,"Am i being finicky and hard to please? A yarn about crafting, researching and upgrading in games.","Warning: wall of text!

Although i've been playing games for over 20 years now, it's finally occured to me what i really don't like.

It's all do to with things like upgrading of units in strategy games or crafting and upgrading of skills or buffs. 
The initial games that come to mind are the crafting and upgrading in The Division, crafting in games like Farcry and researching and implementing upgrades of units in games like Homeworld and Warhammers Dawn of War.

What got me to really notice this recently was The Division and Homeworld.

Homeworld is hard enough as it is for me, what with the controls, remembering what the formations do and different interfaces etc. 
After a while of playing this game and getting used to how to run things i realised to make any decent progress i really needed to research and implement upgrading of ships and technology. 
With so much going on in the game i find it confusing as hell to deal with all this other stuff that i really don't think is necessary.
Just give me the units or let me gather resources to build them or get the game to release more powerful units as i progress with out me having to upgrade and research just to make my armour better by 5% or increase the power of a laser weapon by a factor of 2 or whatever.

I have a similar issue with Dawn of War.
Ok so this particular level sees me having to build a lot of units and fight in 3 different areas simultaneously.

Oh wait my headquarters is at a certain level, this now allows me to upgrade my barracks which will allow me to research a certain something to allow a squad leader to rally the troops and boost firepower.
Seriously i just want to get on with my tactics and make sure i'm building the right units and putting them in the right place to counter the enemy. I don't have time to research special underpants that will heal a unit it if a nearby machine happens to fart at a certain point.

I really enjoy The Division but the whole crafting and skill mods just complicate things and make the game far more complex than it needs to be. I find that to make progress in this game you have to spend a large chunk of time at the crafting bench creating things to modify literally everything. If you don't then you will find things get very difficult despite how well you play. Enemies just soak up your rounds like they're nothing and their rounds hit 10x harder. Sure balancing may well need to be looked at but a lot of it comes down to how you've modded your weapons and what mods you've put on your damn knee pads or backpack.
I want my skill of planning the approach to an enemy or getting good at aiming and using the right tools at the right time to win the fight. Not slog it out and lose just because the other guy was buffed more than me. That's not skill.

Crafting in general i find pointless in a lot of games.

Farcry 3 and the 2013 reboot of Tomb Raider highlighted the annoyance of crafting for me.

Running around and killing animals or picking plants to craft something to give me a stat boost felt like something they just threw in FC3 just to give you something else to do, like a filler.
In Tomb Raider it appeared that crafting etc was essential to move along in the game - although to be fair i didn't get very far in the game because all the crafting put me off so much i stopped playing. Thats not Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider is figuring out puzzles, blitzing things with weapons, getting different and more powereful weapons as you progress, feeling like Indiana Jones. Not spending 30 mins creating a certain type of arrow that will heal you for a certain percentage if you hit the enemy in the left elbow. To be honest i don't remember much about the game as i think i only spent an hour or 2 in total so i could well be talking tripe...

I wonder though if i'm being a bit contrary. 
There are other games that implement upgrading and crafting that i enjoy. 
I don't know if it's because i love the games so much or the developers just got it right.

Skyrim and WoW require crafting and i found that enjoyable, but also non essential so you weren't forced to do it to progress and it didn't make you play poorly just because you didn't enchant your codpiece... You still get loads out of the game and don't have to go gathering or crafting if you don't want to.

War Thunder and Elite: Dangerous have you spending in game currency to upgrade various parts to your vehicles and to really make an impact you really do need to spend a bit of time looking at and reading information on the upgrades and purchasing them.
This doesn't bother me at all for some reason and i find the goal of getting enough xp or credits enjoyable.

I don't mind complexity in games. I like SimCity and the odd flying sim. Hell i even appreciated Eve online. Even though i could never git gud at these games i could appreciate that putting the hours in and learning and eventually being able to play would be rewarding but nothing really seemed pointless, unlike the afore mentioned.
The games i mentioned at the beginning seem to have been bulked up and inflated with pointless activities. The games are already great. They don't need to be made more complex.

Anyway, this was all a bit of a yarn and i hope my rambling made some sort of sense.

I don't consider myself a particularly good gamer but i likes what i likes and can enjoy a game even if i'm mediocre at best at it.

With a lot of games i want to use skill and tactics and good ol fashioned trial and error to 'beat' the game. 
Don't force me to spend time crafting and buffing just to make myself stronger than the enemy. It's just a chore.",technology,1479870744

personalfinance,Need advice on investment vehicles,"TL;DR: Does life insurance make sense for me?

Hi Reddit,

I recently spoke with a personal wealth adviser after a family member suggested that I do so and have some questions regarding the adviser's suggestions on what investment vehicles to explore.  Some more details before I get into the bulk of this question: 

I am a 27 year old single male in the US making $80k pre-tax after salary/bonus.  I was lucky in that I graduated college with no student debt and have accumulated no credit card debt.  I bought my first house in April of 2015 for ~$163k (4.75% interest rate, may refinance eventually) and have roughly $7k left on a car loan (2.24% interest rate).  Mortgage payment is just over $1k/mo (I have 2 roommates paying the bulk of this) and my car payment is $316.  I'm maxing out my Roth IRA ($5,500/yr) and have 6% going into an unmatched company 401(k).  The non-match is a bit unfortunate but they may match down the road.  

All said and done, after expenses (i.e. phone, utilities, food, beer, etc.) I've been able to accumulate anywhere from $1k-$2k per month depending on how frugal I was that month.  I could probably budget a bit better but that's a different topic.  I've saved up roughly $18k in cash over the past year or so and anticipate that to continue growing, hence why I'm speaking with the adviser.  

Think that covers the important points, now to my question.  The adviser recommended that I start a brokerage account with mutual funds, which is in line with what I was expecting to hear all along.  He recommended I put $5-$8k into that account for starters with a $463/mo recurring investment, leaving the rest of the cash as my emergency fund.  Makes sense.  

He then recommended that I invest in a perm life insurance policy ($350/mo) which is where I start to get confused.  I'm fuzzy on why this might be the right fit for me and how exactly it works in my favor, or how it works in general for that matter.

My questions:

- Does a life insurance policy make sense for me considering I'm not married and have no kids?  Life insurance itself doesn't really appeal to me at this stage in my life but what would the benefits be as an investment vehicle given my situation?

- If life insurance doesn't make the most sense, what other routes could I utilize as investments so that I don't have cash just collecting dust?

personalfinance,Just got in a fenderbender. To go through insurance or not?,"Alright, so I just got out of an accident about an hour ago.
I was in the center/right lane, turning right into a gas station. There was a BMW on my bumper briefly beforehand. I was slowed down, almost to the point of stopping, I had my indicator on and was making it obvious I was going to turn. The BMW cut to the right of me and tried to beat me around the turn. I didn't think he'd do that, rather just wait until I was done turning. I didn't see him cut around me and he ended up in the path of my turn, smack goes the cars. I drive a 2012 Ford Expedition, big car and all. No real damage on mine, some scuffed paint, a very slightly damaged hubcap, some marks that will buff out. His car, on the other hand, was all sorts of messed up.
I'm not sure how to post a URL, but this is a link to the album of the pictures before and after the crash. I took pictures before while we were stopped just because I thought his car was.. well strange. Regardless, you can see the damage to his car and his license plate(which is very blurry, probably past the point of censoring). Stupidly, I didn't call the police. I'd assumed we can figure it out on our own, incase we want to avoid insurance.
What should I do? Do I go through insurance or not?
Take note, we're both young. I'm 18 and the guy I had an accident with is 20.
I had a mild fender bender before this that we decided to not do through insurance, as the damage was minimal. http://imgur.com/a/NDQYC",finance,1479892478

personalfinance,How can I feel less stressed about money when I have nothing to be stressed about?,"Initially I thought this was a good trait. I am one of the most frugal people you'll meet. Now that I have the money to do what I'll want with, I'm savings solely for the purpose of life savings. It's almost an addiction. I'll pick up any/as many shifts at work as possible to speed up and increase my bank figures. 

Some details about me:

I'm 19 with about $12.5k saved (AUD). I own my car (4K) and my camera (2.5k). I have other things which would probably net me around 1-2k if I sold them. 

I'm planning a backpacking trip around Europe with a budget of about 12k, but that isn't until the end of next year. Between now and then, I have planned to work and save as much as possible for when I start uni in 2018. 

But my main issue is I see nearly everyone else just casually strolling through life. I simply can't do that financially/emotionally. I check my bank balance at least twice a day on any given day, even if I haven't touched anything. I will also frequently calculate how much money I should have by the time I leave for Europe daily. I like numbers. I like watching them grow. I like to calculate my interest rates also. It's almost compulsive. And I think it's unhealthy. 

I feel slightly guilty when I go off the strict budget I have put myself on. Knowing if I go out with friends, or go out for tea then it's money I won't get back. I'm not sure if this is destroying my life or anything, but I think I have concluded it's not healthy.

The issue is that if I don't do this, I won't be happy. I only pay $50 a week rent, car insurance/rego, petrol and occasionally other things. This is the time for me to be saving as much as I can. But I'm not sure if it's worth it in the end?

personalfinance,Investing in leveraged ETFs and paying back debt,"Say I have debt in the form of mortage or student loans, with a decent interest rate.

I also have 1000$ in savings which, considering my risk profile, I'd rather invest than directly use to refund debt.

Would it make more sense to invest 1000$ in, say, a SP500 ETF, or 500$ in a leveraged 2x SP500 ETF, and use 500$ to repay some of my personnal debt?

In **theory** the question boils down to: 

Is it reasonable to assume that the ETF provider is paying less in explicit or implicit interest than I would be on my mortage or student loans?

In practice is that all we have to consider?

Implicit interest rate here is the ""interest rate"" that is hidden in the option prices the leveraged fund would be using. 

EDIT: I should probably make it clear that this is hypothetical and the 1000$ is an example... 

The idea is that, for all intents and purposes, if you're going to invest in an index fund and also have personnal debt, investing in a leveraged version of that fund and repaying your personnal debt is a way to swap your interest rate for theirs.",finance,1479912181

I'm getting my first paycheck on Friday 25th.

Here are the details:

- From October 3rd to November 15th: I was supposed to get $13,538.
They are paying me this as a ""Transition Bonus"" and are rounding it to $15,000 (meaning they gave me $1,462 for the trouble)

- From November 16th to November 19th: I am getting $1,269 (at a $52.88 rate, for 3 days)

I am getting this paycheck on November 25th. (paychecks work with a week delay)


The total is **$16,269** and here are the taxes:

* OASDI: $1,008.69 (6.2%)
* Medicare: $236.90 (1.45%)
* Federal Withholding: $3,909.57 (24%)
* State Tax - NY: $1,493.55 (9.2%)
* City Tax - NY: $670.31 (4.1%)
* NY SDI: $1.20

here's what I'm looking for/paying attention to, am i missing anything or looking at this wrong?

currently owe $116,000, when purchased (3 years ago) the duplex appraised for $184,000. I know this is a bad way to gauge value, but it raised my interest and kick started this whole idea: zillow.com currently has my duplex valued at $470,000.

I want to refinance from an FHA into a conventional loan, so that I can open up the option of using FHA loan again.

my current interest rate is 4.25% and I do not want anything above 5%.

while refinancing I would like to pull out about $15,000 from the loan to purchase the next property and do a little bit of interior work (hang ceiling fans, cabinets etc.).

I want to make sure the loan is a fixed rate 30 year loan.

I want to make sure all fees that are applicable to refinancing are rolled into the loan so that I pay nothing out of pocket. 

am I missing anything really important? I'm waiting to hear back with what my property ACTUALLY appraises for before deciding how much to pull out, but looking at other comps I am pretty confident that it will appraise for around $200,000.

*side note* if my duplex appraises for more than $300,000 I will probably sell it outright, and buy the other investment property cash.

personalfinance,New Grad Nurse Seeking Financial Advice,"Hi PF!

First time poster, long-time lurker, and soon to be new grad looking for some financial and budgeting advice. I’m a soon to be new graduate nurse who has secured a job around the triangle area of NC and planning my next move in life. My goals are to: 1. Move out, 2. Pay off my loans as soon as possible, and 3. Create a savings for a house or future investments.

Currently, my future employer pays 23.50/hr base pay, which is equates to about 43k gross a year give or take. This has potential to increase due to shift differential pay, which I plan on working primarily nights and weekends for the extra cash. Also after the first 6 months I will probably pick up at least 1 day of overtime a month. I’m graduating with approximately 26k in federal loans, which I want to get rid of ASAP. It has an estimated repayment of $267 a month over 10 years. Hopefully I don’t drag out the payments that long lol.
From my calculations I reckon 43k annually is approximately 2.8k take home pay. My budget includes 
&amp;nbsp;

Rent: $830
&amp;nbsp;

Utilities: $150
&amp;nbsp;

Groceries: $150
&amp;nbsp;

Transportation: $100
&amp;nbsp;

Medical Insurance: $100
&amp;nbsp;

Entertainment: $100
&amp;nbsp;

Misc: $100
&amp;nbsp;

Student loans: $350 (play on paying more than the minimum)
No other outstanding debts. No credit card. No car payment. Car is in good health and properly maintained. I don’t exactly plan on spending $100 on entertainment, but it’s more of a buffer.
That puts me at a grand total of $1880 in expenses for the month, with a savings of $920. Is this a good budget?

I’ve considered living with a roommate to save money on rent, but I’ve only met people who are looking for a 2-3 bedroom that’s almost the same as me living on my own. Plus I do prefer the added privacy and freedom of living solo. However, moving out is a must; I cannot live at home because my future place of work is about 2 hours away and the hospital near home pay significantly less.

The added benefit of my job is that they do offer loan repayment, up to 25k over 3 years. The only downside is that it’s distributed once a year in lump sum payments. Essentially, if I pay my monthly payments plus the loan repayment program, I could pay off my loans within that 3 year period.
Does this sound like a good plan? Or should I adjust some adjust my budget? What do you recommend?
Thanks!",finance,1479929126
personalfinance,(US) Is anyone familiar with NASA Federal mortgages?,"I keep hearing commercials for NASA Federal; I think it's a credit union.

Bitcoin,If bitcoin becomes (significantly) more costly to transact people will spend fiat (faster) and hodl/save bitcoin,"Then creating a massively back-log of transactions is both a stress test and like sparking flint onto a well built fire. Governments would be forced to tone up the quality of money as the velocity increased from people exchanging fiat for bitcoin (https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43339.pdf):

&gt; However, if the scale of use were to grow substantially larger, there could be reason for some concern. Conceptually, Bitcoin could have an impact on the conduct of monetary policy to the extent that it would (1) substantially affect the quantity of money or (2) influence the velocity (rate of circulation) of money through the economy by reducing the demand for dollars.

&gt; Regarding the velocity of money, if the increase in the use of Bitcoin leads to a decrease in need for holding dollars, it would increase the dollar’s velocity of circulation and tend to increase the money supply associated with any given amount of base money (currency in circulation plus bank reserves held with the Fed).",cryptocurrency,1479962067

investing,"For those who take the view that a recession and/or market crash is likely to happen in the near term (within nxt yr), what do you expect to cause the ""shock"" that results in the recession/crash?","People often forget that recessions and market crashes usually only happen when there's some sort of economic ""shock"".  In the most recent crisis, you had the housing market and toxic securitized products, the early 2000s had the popping of the tech/telecom bubble, and oil price shocks contributed to recessions in the 70s and early 90s.

Currently, it seems to me that there are actually more bright spots in the economy that would make it even more difficult to tip the economy into a recession. The consumer is in better shape then it's been in in a long time, manufacturing, which has been a weak spot, looks to be improving, housing continues to be pretty strong.  

People thought the fall out from the drop in energy prices could be the trigger, but the economy held up. 

The Fed has been super sensitive to the reactions of the market. Interest rate increases are likely come at a very gradual pace, in my opinion. 

So, my question is, what's going to cause the ""shock"" that drives a near term crash?",finance,1479967004
investing,What is up with the dollar vs treasuries ?,"The way I don't understand Trump is this. Either he's going to print boatloads of money, or he's not. Let's analyse each situation:

1) boatloads of money print + infrastructure spending with massive hiring

Immediate consequences would be a drop in the dollar, medium term inflation and employment would improve. Also this ought to provide investment opportunities for the big banks who would be able to deploy capital at higher interest rates. Mortgage rates should go up and so should treasuries. Combined with a Fed hike this should lead to far higher borrowing costs for governments around the globe who are already borrowing to pay interest and have mostly been saving money for the past decade or so. So this should lead to Euro printing, Yen printing, ... so medium term you'd expect things to get back into equilibrium and the dollar should rise again, but to a different level.

2) (he has to get spending approved in the Senate/Congress after all) no money printing/infrastructure spending

Given the FED's rhetoric the interest rate would still rise, but far more modestly. The dollar would rise, because it's slowly on it's way to become a high-yielding currency again (or at least that'll be the going theory until the next crisis, just like in 2005). This should result in a rise in the dollar. We would however remain stuck in our slow secular drain-circling ""where the fuck did demand for X go ?"" loop. Governments would continue on their current path of slowly making things worse for ever more citizens with austerity, but nothing has to change until the pension crashes actually start happening, which won't be until 2019-2020, maybe even 2030, at which point they'll still be forced to print money.

I would like to add option 3:

3) The market suddenly throws a tantrum and after the SPX drops 30% the FED, with the donald's agreement resumes QE in earnest, but of course without infrastructure spending because at this point congress and the senate block any large debt increases in the government, and they're pretty upset at having to approve the next round of QE ""or face certain doom"" (again). Dollar drops back to previous levels against the Euro/other currencies.

Now Trump has promised to implement options 1 and 2 both. Obviously both happening together is out of the question. Given his appointment of Steve Bannon and what Mr. Bannon has posted when not in a hateful drunk stupor, e.g. [1], one would assume that (1) is the current plan.

But the market seems to believe that (1) and (2) will happen at the same time, and has pretty much fully discounted (3) (I'd put it on, perhaps 10% odds of happening) :

Spectacular dollar rally

Rally in short term interest rates, including treasury interest rates

Rally in bank stocks (a rally starting from the lowest level these banks have been at for a long time)

So markets seem to predict massive government spending, serious rise in inflation and no extra government debt at all, ie. a serious reduction in government spending. Does anyone know why were seeing these things at the same time ? Are we really in a situation where significant parts of the market believe Mr. Trump is a magician, unbound by economic realities that affect everyone else ? To me, this doesn't make sense.

That would mean, if you take Trump at his word, a lot of money can be made betting against the dollar. If you assume he's lying or he's incompetent (both distinct possibilities), a lot of money can be made betting this latest financials rally will come off the rails, a bet which would pay off even better if (3) does come to pass, even temporarily.

personalfinance,"Credit a mess, little retirement savings, wanting to buy a house in a couple years....Please help me prioritize and give me some hope.","Hi all

I'm feeling overwhelmed. 

Husband is working at a good job finally. He makes $47,000 base salary but that also comes with free housing, approx $20k extra in travel (we live overseas), a monthly allowance towards a car payment (we pretend it doesn't exist and it goes straight to paying off the car we bought for about $8k) and free healthcare.

Sounds like the sweetest deal ever, right? Like, so easy to save? Yeah. 

Except one year later, we have only saved about $10,000. We got our $20k bonus and somehow ended up with $7k on credit card debt when a previous windfall of $10k allowed us to pay them all off. 

Oh, and before the $7k in credit cards AND the $10k windfall that got out out of debt, I cashed out the $11,000 we had invested that was meant for retirement (not an IRA since we are overseas).

Seriously, WHAT THE FUCK. 

**HELP ME**. 

In the midst of all this, my husband's credit got completely fucked. He had a long-standing credit card (history of about 10 years, which for people under 30 is a big deal) with a high limit, like $15k that had like $100 unpaid for months. Since we live overseas, we didn't get the mail and I guess we both assumed the other person was on top of our accounts....so long story short the credit account was closed. 

I paid off the balance and called to ask to have his account reinstated, but my research shows it's pretty much not possible anyway. Fuck. 

THEN, he finally got his $17k in student loans forgiven after getting the run around for MONTHS. Thing is, he never paid the damn thing while it was going through this whole loan forgiveness application process. So he was in default. FUCK again. 

The student loan is paid off. 

We have a previous car loan from Wells Fargo that was paid on time every time and in full in less than 3 years, so that's good I guess? He also had a mortgage that was never late, and obviously got paid off when we sold the house. 

Here's our situation:

$16k in a retirement account through the state 

$2k in an IRA (Vanguard)

$15k in a savings account with 1% interest rate

$10k in a regular savings account with our bank stateside

-$7k credit card debt

Monthly income of about $4,000

2 kids

My score is 660 and his is 605. 

We want to buy a house and live like normal human beings when we return home, but I am extra worried. I am currently not working and he is a school teacher. So it's not like our earning potential is great. We need to have our shit together when we are done here, and I have royally fucked us over this year. 

We wanted to have $25,000 saved by now. We haven't even made half that goal AND have credit card debt despite an extra $20k. SERIOUSLY WHO DOES THAT.

I feel like a failure. The stress of this keeps me up at night. 

How can we improve our score over the next year? 

Currently, it is our goal to save $2k per month. How is it that we only have $10k saved? Like, where the fuck did all that money go? Last month we took out the remainder of salary and all our purchases--groceries, gas, and fun money--came out of the cash fund. That seemed to work well. Transferring savings into the less accessible online bank account seems to have worked well too.

What should our priority be here? **Savings, paying off debt, or retirement?** I am so overwhelmed.",finance,1479990461
gaming,TIL of a potentially fun game called Rising Thunder (Fighter Game),"It's a free-to-play fighter game, similar to Skullgirls or Street Fighter, but with robots, bringing you the feel of Real Steel. It was made with very simplistic rules in mind. Simple controls, but there would be more depth in it, and the roster would be balanced, so there aren't gonna be any ""nerfed"" or ""OP"" characters.

I thought this game had a lot of potential in the free-to-play market. Certainly looks ostentatious. I mean, who wouldn't wanna do a 'robot vs. robot', right? Play style is very similar to Street Fighter IV. It was still in its Alpha.

But because of Radiant Entertainment being acquired by Riot Games, the developers decided to dump it, to focus on other games. Like, really?

I would've had such high hopes for it, if only I knew about this game much earlier. 

I downloaded it to see if I could still play it. Needed a login. That means I needed to register. Which is impossible because their website is shut down. I don't know if there are dedicated gamers who'd mod it, or if there's already a fix to this, but it would be brilliant if there was.

personalfinance,Refinance Advice (x-post on Finance),"Hello Everyone...I just joined, long time lurker.  
This is my first post on reddit, and I'm hoping to get some advice on a home refinance.  
My situation: I will likely be in this home for another 5 years. I would like to make extra payments and pay off the loan in 10 years, but still have the flexibility for cash flow a 30 year mortgage provides.  
Current Loan:  Interest: 4.15%  Loan Balance $329,478.46   Escrow Balance: $2,591.74   Recent Home Appraisal: $395,000   LTV: 83%  
Current Payment Breakdown  Principal: $627.19  Interest: $1,134.74  Escrow: $943.98  Total Payment: $2705.41  
Proposed Refinance Loan:  Interest: 3.5%  Loan Amount: $335,750  
New Loan Payment Breakdown:  Principal &amp; Interest: $1507.67   Mortgage Insurance: $53.16  Monthly Escrow: $922.06  Total Payment: $2,482.89  

I asked the lender about the huge increase in the loan amount, and I hope reddit can help me evaluate the response that I received from the broker:  

--Begin Broker Response--   
At the current loan amount you are due to get $384.50 in cash back upon the loan funding.  

At the bottom of page # 2 of the closing disclosure you will see a lender credit in the amount of $6,231.52 which covers the following closing cost.  

Origination Fee (Section A) - $4,125.00   
Credit Report Fee (Section B) - $75.14  
Flood Certificate Fee (Section B) - $12.00   
Title/Settlement Charges (Section C) - $1,794.00   
Recording Fee (Section E) - $183.00  
Total - $6,189.14

As you will see the lender credit fully covers these cost and provides an additional lender credit above and beyond these cost of $42.38  

The payoff of your existing mortgage is identified on page 3 of the closing disclosure in the amount of $331,240.50 which includes all interest from November 1st through the day your loan is due to fund. The new loan amount is higher than the payoff by $4,509.50 which is going towards covering the following expenses.  

Monies To Fund New Escrow Account (Section G) - $3,688.20   Prorated Principal Reduction (Section H) - $479.18   
Total - $4,167.38  

The difference the loan amount and the payoff exceeds this amount by $342.12 which in combination with the $42.38 that our lender credit exceeds your cost, make up the monies you are getting back in the amount of $384.50.  

Please note the principal reduction of $479.18 will be a principal payment in this amount made on your behalf upon your loan funding, when you receive your first mortgage statement your principal balance will reflect this payment being made on your behalf and be lower than your current loan amount by this principal payment amount.    

You will not have a December mortgage payment on your old or new mortgage, your first payment on your new mortgage will be January 1st. Any monies in your existing escrow account with your existing lender will be refunded to you within 30 days of closing.  

--End Broker Response--  

My plan:  
1. Fund the escrow account myself for the new mortgage out of my savings account, and replenish my savings account with the escrow amount that I am refunded from my previous lender.  

This will reduce the principal amount on the new loan.

2. Approach the new lender about reducing origination fees, as well as lowering the interest rate.  

Questions:  
1.Does what the mortgage broker's statement make sense? Why is the loan amount so inflated?  
2. Does my plan make sense? 
3. Mortgage insurance: my old loan doesn't have mortgage insurance, but my new one does. What gives?

personalfinance,Refinance student loans before applying for mortgage?,"So here's our situation. My wife and I are looking to sell our current home and purchase another in Spring 2017.  My wife has student loans (approx $26000, the highest interest rate is close to 7%) that have been in deferment since she decided to change careers and needed a different degree.  I was planning on getting her to refinance when she lands a new (and higher paying) job, to help lower our debt to income ratio, in addition to just paying less overall.

Now to the question. I know that it is highly discouraged to take on more debt and open new lines of credit prior to applying for a mortgage. When we are in the approval process, will lenders see this as new debt, since it's a new loan being created?  Or can they recognize that she's had this debt prior and that it's not really new, and thus doesn't hurt our chances of securing a mortgage?",finance,1479994206

If the writer does not want to see him nailed up on the pillar of humiliation, go learn some economics, plow through Satoshi’s whitepaper again esp. the economic logics in it. Also the writer needs to learn coding so as to avoid a mentality of a liberal art student. TBH your article is getting dramatic.
1. 1)	Core never said the block size will stay at 1 MB, SegWit is a robust strategy at this moment.
2. 2)	Your so-called HK consensus is nothing but a paper with seals from a few pools, a one-sided opinion. It’s not consensus.
3. 3)	What an interesting conspiracy theory, you sound like the rest of the world is against China. How sick is that? Bitcoin has no national boundaries.

**lxq990061**

Back in 1840 in San Francisco, miners got rich with gold. But many more joined the game later on and with more ppl leaving the west empty-handed. How tragic. This is history, just like the one happening with Bitcoin. It was the pubs and inns opened near the gold mines earned real money: like the platforms today. Devs at Core are just like the merchants back in the day sipping their tea and trash-talking. But Core is indeed stupid: an 8-year long decentralized system requires support from a 95%? Some serious shit in their head.

**讨厌装逼犯**

You guys trash talk everyday non-stop...be quiet! This kind of argument cannot convince anyone. Harsh words+personall attacks just make it more chaotic. Politics...parties...freedom...conspiracy: disgusting. And this kind of article? Who you can convince? This is not the day 1 of the debate. True decision makers already have it in their mind. You ordinary ppl can change nothing even if you are convinced. My guess is whoever writes this kind of story must be someone who enjoys being worshiped by ppl on top of the ranks of “revolution”. You just like to quench your own thirst for fame. Worst case has nothing to do with tech, it’s a match for computation power, capital and strength. System set that C.power decides so let it be. Bitcoin will take on its due course no matter what. The disgusting part is the incitation, the manipulation of ppl’s emotions, and cap everything “a matter of revolution”. We Chinese ppl know this too well. Scaling is no longer about tech, but winning. Is it meaningful?  The shame is not with the devs, they (inl. Core and BU) contributed their wisdom and labor. The real shame is with you talkers who humiliate ppl. You are so good, why not show me your money? Bitcoin is a merely 10B system, go buy it. If you cannot, just don’t trash talk.

**idgui.com**

 1)	lots of companies and apps are waiting for segwit, and OP is not against segwit, then
https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/
why not implement it in the easiest way? SF is quite close , as long as enough miners support. HF egwit delivers community splitting risks.
2)	LN can be decentralized enough should there be enough LN nodes. It won’t be concentrated on a handful of nodes. We can implement some limits on the main chain if we see an inclination toward centralization, such as higher tx fee for big nodes to limit big centralized LN node.
3)	Main chain tx fee won’t be ridiculously high. If it does, miners get RICH, no? now we have 4% in tx fee, raise by 25 times you get more reward from it than the block reward. Then it’s acceptable even now, let alone future. Big amount tx are few. Small amount can be offchain, on LN or on sidechains.
4)	SegWit has been thoroughly tests, and it’s a SF, compatible to previous nodes. There won’t be a major issue. Any code has risks, can you call BU risk-free? It depends on the level of risk. Segwit SF is acceptable, at most rolling back to 0.13.0, and segwit can increase little by little, not a sudden change. BU’s HF is different, with risks of splitting the entire ecosystem.
5)	Miners have freedom of voting, but do consider the interests at large. You must represent the interests of the entire ecosystem, at least try to. We need decentralized nodes and unified ecosystem. SF segwit needs to be activated under consensus, and we can wait. HF needs even greater consensus or we risk losing it all. If we cannot have enough consensus for either HF or SF segwit, then we should let the SF segwit happen, since it has no risks of destruction.

Maybe I wrote it in bad order, let me edit it in the future. Don’t jump to conclusion OP. Segwit should be activated in the future.



 **Support**

**gjw**   

Core knows nothing about the spirit of contract. They ignore their public ann. a few months ago. A direct scaling is the simplest and most effective way of solving our urgent problem. Why roll out this thing that requires long-time testing?
To have a worldwide success for Bitcoin, you need to provide ppl with access at low costs. It’s just like Internet. Core either has a vicious intention or has no faith in Bitcoin. If one day Bitcoin is being used by 9 digits of ppl, the main chain block size cannot be enough even at 100 MB. Micro payment still needs to go through something like LN. What’s the meaning of keeping the block size at 1MB?
7 years ago the block size was set at 1MB, what’s the hardware like 7 years ago? What the growth of bandwidth and storage in 7 years? 10 years or 20 years from now?
The main battlefield of Bitcoin is in China. We Chinese ppl should not be satisfied with mining a few coins or gamble on a few exchanges. Take the responsibility and obligation of contribution. But, words are so much cheaper than codes. We need advanced devs for the main battlefield.


**changyong**

I appreciate Jiang Zhuo’er’s main points, they coincide with my opinions on the Chengdu blockchain conference:
1. scaling, segwit and LN should all be implemented.
2.it is highly wrong to make the main chain a settlement network
3. LN and the main chain are for different purposes and should not be inter-placeable.
4. main chain jam is driving towards LN Matthew Effect and monopolies.
5. miner decision is most rational and trust-worthy
6. tech and propaganda monopolies are endangering the whole system
7. SF increases long-term systemic debt and risks

A supplementary 8 points
1. blocksize cannot meet with the market demand for a long time---this is no less significant of a tech loophole. So a HF is a worthy action.
2. HF is an important instrument for Bitcoin to metabolize. Demonizing HF is suicidal.
3. The lack of incentives for devs and the centralization of tech are the paramount systemic risks at this moment
4. BU is a good start for competition, which will eliminate tech centralization.
5. HF scaling will not change the current landscape of profits and power, turning the main chain into a settlement network will. The latter carries great risks of Bitcoin failure.
6. Demonizing HF is a coverup for the changes and risks associated with the settlement network roadmap.
7. Democracy of Bitcoin requires ration, not loyalty and passion from the Bitcoiners, else, we are en route dictatorship.
8. For the sake of the wealth and energy you put into this, plz resort to reason, not blind worshipping and personal attacks.

**myx**

If you can compete with confidence, do compete under the same level of consensus.
Bitcoin is the flapship of cryptos. An easy HF and an influential forked chain in the aftermath can be catastrophic. Miners can benefit in the short run after the spilitting. But in the long run, we all lose. A lowered threshold in anticipation of an easier fork is much worse than staying put.
Based on Boss Jiang’s statement, 95% consensus can produce a 5% forked chain...then there will always be minority miners forking. In the end, the recognition of Bitcoin comes from users. Self-important forks by some miners are nothing but Alts. We have enough alts, no? So, 95%+ consensus is the only way to maintain unification. A coin without support from most of the users is an alt!
Miners do get to decide, but the ultimate right is with the users’ recognition! If a 95%+ consensus is with a solution, then the rest minority do not matter. So, a solution without a high degree of consensus in a way is splitting the ecosystem. If BU dares not to bring up a 95% threshold, and in your own words, if a 51% HF is enough for a HF...you will end up splitting the ecosystem!
Boss Jiang is a miner, and he feels he’s investing bigly, and he gets to decide. But in fact you are just for profit, not some Samaritan. Miners are just making profits on the most-recognized coin. Nothing to do with ethics. But a fair competition, by your own words, must be on the same criteria. Just like the 270 electoral votes in US presidential election. A common threshold.
So, if BU wants to compete with segwit, do so under the same level of consensus. Any solution under a 95% consensus is just trolling for your own cowardice!

**indexindex**

The scaling debate involves 
1)scaling for Bitcoin’s future and 
2)breaking dev monopoly. Dev is the easiest part to control than hashing powers and users, literally the weakest part in the decentralization course of Bitcon.
Spend 7 or 8 digits of USD on core devs, then you can control a multi-billion level product...that’s a good bargin for numerous capitals.
Devs must realize that they can be abandoned should they do harm to Bitcoin in exchange of their own interests. Not just Core, but every dev team should understand this. BS’ investment must go burn, so as to make it a good example for future players.

2. 2)	You mentioned LN will become a giant-dominated market based on Matthew Effect. Is our main chain facing the same risks?

**sfire to bikanyong**

Yes. LN is a secondary network with no need to broadcast network-wide. So LN has more frequent tx than the main chain. Small amount fast payment can be allowed.
There is a price for not broadcasting network-wide: serious centralization risks (as seen in the article). So it can only be used for auxiliary purposes, but not as a foundation. The main chain is free from this risk becoz all miners on the main chain are equal. Gov may shut down 99% of the miners while the remaining 1% could still be handling tx.
LN differentiates nodes with big ones and small ones. In the end, the big ones may end up huge and be banned by the gov. With the remaining allowed un-compliant small nodes, you cannot (very possibly) find a route of transfer in the LN, causing you failures in transfers.

**bikanyongto sfire**

You mean: Nodes on the main chain are equal, while in the LN, big nodes are more powerful than the small ones. Or put it another way: the nodes on the current main chain are inter-dependent, while they could get competitive against each other on the LN.---is it ok to put it like this?

**sfire to bikanyong**

It’s not that big nodes on the LN have more power, but connects more users. E.g. many ppl may, for the sake of their rate and service, connect to a giant “Coin-Pay or Coin-Pal” kind of node. If they want to transfer to users on another node called “Coin-Wechat”, they have to go through a route provided by “Coin-Pal”. Then, the giant node “Coin-Pal” bans you, leaving you in de facto ban from transfers to most ppl on the LN.

**kok99999 to bikanyong**

LN changes the topology of the network, and changes the whole game.

**独行**   

Just becoz you need to enlarge the userbase, you need to scale up? It’s hilarious. The transfer of tx requires cost. No matter how wide is the highway, you don’t charge ppl, you will have a heave traffic. Via the market’s hand, only big amount tx are allowed on the chain---this does not affect the liquidity of onchain assets.

**sfire to 独行**

You can go offer some advice to the gov and ask them not to build up our infrastructure, since it’s so costy. Just charge ppl money, how convenient is that? Only luxury cars are allowed on the road....this does not affect the vitality of the city.

**wz to 独行**

What you are saying is not market’s hand. Leaving ppl with no choice is a market behavior? Free competition is the market’s hand.

**无名 to 独行**

No hard facts other than trashing ppl...no reasoning...these resemble your Core masters.

**BTC专业工**

I just wanna say: Hail to Multi-Party system! One-Party Dictatorship is doomed.

**mellowtone**

Support miners, support PoW and computational-power-consensus is the real consensus.

**pyjx306**

If tx fee goes up, I will quit.

**savage**

Since Core is so determined to castrate the main chain and revolution miners out, why did they set the 95% threshold? Core has no computation power, and they are so confident that miners will load their heads with enough shit and support Core?

**sfire**

It’s just a routine to set the 95% threshold for SF. If Core does not use the figure, the anti-Core voice will only grow, furthering their success rate down.

**amo1998**

95% could be of more complicated reasons. I think BS should have taken into consideration that they control at least 5% of the C.power. (S pool and BTCC pool). If I were BS, I’d have a contingency plan for worst-case scenario. Even 95% means we fail, we BS will not allow for a HF. We can also bash you from a moral high ground and accuse the onchain scailing side.

**caitong**

I cannot tell which one is better, HF first or SegWit first...both seemed to be practical and dangerous. But both sides have their own political agenda---that’s for sure. We avg. Joes prefer that, no matter what solution taken or risks what come along, just march on. We cannot stay here and die.

**wz**

No development=you will be taken by someone else. The network jam is significantly hindering its future. SegWit and LN cannot be replacements for a HF, Core knows that, but they still want to use them to replace a HF solution. Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency out there. No user, no value.

**yangzi666**

Still, no matter what solution, if we have 2 chains and 2 Bitcoins, there will be chaos esp. for newbies. Miners and exchanges will take side and cause even greater chaos. Attention ppl: those were bashing Bitcoin with short positions all day long are now also in favor of THAT solution! Newton had it: I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people! HF is not a good solution at this moment. No matter which one, there must be no risk of forking into 2 chains---that qualifies an option on the table.

**wz**

SegWit and LN are not the replacement of a HF. Core has their own interests. You ostrich ppl just keep your heads in the sand, the risks won’t go away.

**yangzi666 reply wz**

1)I am no osrich. I will not be speaking here if I had my head in the sand, esp. at the risks of your bashings.
2)I oppose the risks of Bitcoin forking into 2 coins: you need to live longer to have the experience of humanity.
3)Seriously suggest you guys use some mild words, don’t be so dramatic.
Just get your opinions clear no matter what you are proposing. Don’t just attack other ppl and their solutions. And plz don’t use harsh words. I believe we miners have wisdom. Given time, just wait and see the chart.

**睿思通-专注比特币交易平台开发**

Only miners, who invested millions-worth of personal wealth, the sunk cost, cannot leave like a bitcoiner, thus can be qualified as the Bitcoin’s safe guards.

**nodouble**    

Scaling is what all users want. We just have different opinions on the solution we choose. It’s hard to judge Core’s manipulation, but they do oppose a simple direct scaling. They broke the deal with pools and manipulated the public opinion. You do see these as facts.
You know about IT and finance, and probably with your butt on finance. You earn monopoly profits that others cannot touch. Bitcoin is the genius, the genesis of this sick market. Core’s segwit and LN are in fact copying financial sector’s monopoly nature to Bitcoin, and with an overly engineered tech threshold to solidify the position of interest groups like Blockstream. The scaling of the main chain, a market that naturally embraces users, will bring the disillusionment of LN, a market naturally forcing users.
The conflict of opinions is in fact the fight of power of at a certain level. For Bitcoin, it’s Satoshi’s brilliant design and judgment that has it: we let the miners decide. This is also most reasonable in reality.
Like you said, should we realize it, we are all happy.

**idgui.com**

1)	I’m pro segwit and LN, segwit solves a lot of historical problems and improves efficiency; LN provides greater room for timely confirmations and high frequency tx.
[reply] good, welcome for your choice on segwit+LN. It’s good improvement for the development of the ecosystem. Segwit has a good structure for app developments. LN can realized second-level confirmation and low tx fee that everyone wants.

 2)	Miners being trust-worthy don’t mean all miners can tell the future. Miners are trust-worthy because they see profits. They analyze the interests of all parties. Their behavioral pattern is predictable.
[reply] There are short-term interests and long-term interests. Not all miners are limited to those before their eyes or those in their dreams. Only when interests short-term and long-term are consistent can they be predicted. But you cannot do that now. Also, different miners have different standards of judgement.

3)	ETH HFed many times, not produced a forked chain only once, why? Because this very HF violates the basic principle of cryptocurrency: immutability of blockchain. That’s why ppl reject ETH and would welcome ETC. Then you have trades and markets and price and miners. Previously loyal miners can turn. That’s why I say Chandler’s statement was irrational. Just don’t talk about loyalty and friendship when it comes to cryptos, just talk about interests.
[reply] There’re active and forced HFs. We had one in our history. Along with the later HFs of ETH, they are all bug-fixes that serves only good. But the in the ETH/ETC case, the HF was to find the stolen coins, not for a bug fix: an active HF. Active HF has great potential for splitting the ecosystem, and forced ones are safe. HF scaling is apparently an active HF. Blocksize limit is not an imperative bug fix target; and HF scaling is not necessarily good for everyone, at least it raise the bar to run a full node.

4) Landscape of interests: I’m saying the interests and decision-making patterns of all parties in the system (miners, corps, users, investors, devs) stay the same, not that all interests should remain the same. HF scaling produces no change to the original running mechanism, so the landscape does not change. Even if ETH forked into 2, their interests are in the same old landscape and an Alt relationship between each other.
[reply] You are not aware of the dangers and harms of a split ecosystem. You should read some other articles first. A split is not just about simply see another Alt, it’s overwhelming.

Let’s see what Chinese comments under the article (post on BitKan Chinese news page):

**Against**

**独行**
If the writer does not want to see him nailed up on the pillar of humiliation, go learn some economics, plow through Satoshi’s whitepaper again esp. the economic logics in it. Also the writer needs to learn coding so as to avoid a mentality of a liberal art student. TBH your article is getting dramatic.
1. 1)	Core never said the block size will stay at 1 MB, SegWit is a robust strategy at this moment.
2. 2)	Your so-called HK consensus is nothing but a paper with seals from a few pools, a one-sided opinion. It’s not consensus.
3. 3)	What an interesting conspiracy theory, you sound like the rest of the world is against China. How sick is that? Bitcoin has no national boundaries.

**lxq990061**
Back in 1840 in San Francisco, miners got rich with gold. But many more joined the game later on and with more ppl leaving the west empty-handed. How tragic. This is history, just like the one happening with Bitcoin. It was the pubs and inns opened near the gold mines earned real money: like the platforms today. Devs at Core are just like the merchants back in the day sipping their tea and trash-talking. But Core is indeed stupid: an 8-year long decentralized system requires support from a 95%? Some serious shit in their head.

**讨厌装逼犯**
You guys trash talk everyday non-stop...be quiet! This kind of argument cannot convince anyone. Harsh words+personall attacks just make it more chaotic. Politics...parties...freedom...conspiracy: disgusting. And this kind of article? Who you can convince? This is not the day 1 of the debate. True decision makers already have it in their mind. You ordinary ppl can change nothing even if you are convinced. My guess is whoever writes this kind of story must be someone who enjoys being worshiped by ppl on top of the ranks of “revolution”. You just like to quench your own thirst for fame. Worst case has nothing to do with tech, it’s a match for computation power, capital and strength. System set that C.power decides so let it be. Bitcoin will take on its due course no matter what. The disgusting part is the incitation, the manipulation of ppl’s emotions, and cap everything “a matter of revolution”. We Chinese ppl know this too well. Scaling is no longer about tech, but winning. Is it meaningful?  The shame is not with the devs, they (inl. Core and BU) contributed their wisdom and labor. The real shame is with you talkers who humiliate ppl. You are so good, why not show me your money? Bitcoin is a merely 10B system, go buy it. If you cannot, just don’t trash talk.

**idgui.com**
 1)	lots of companies and apps are waiting for segwit, and OP is not against segwit, then
https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/
why not implement it in the easiest way? SF is quite close , as long as enough miners support. HF egwit delivers community splitting risks.
2)	LN can be decentralized enough should there be enough LN nodes. It won’t be concentrated on a handful of nodes. We can implement some limits on the main chain if we see an inclination toward centralization, such as higher tx fee for big nodes to limit big centralized LN node.
3)	Main chain tx fee won’t be ridiculously high. If it does, miners get RICH, no? now we have 4% in tx fee, raise by 25 times you get more reward from it than the block reward. Then it’s acceptable even now, let alone future. Big amount tx are few. Small amount can be offchain, on LN or on sidechains.
4)	SegWit has been thoroughly tests, and it’s a SF, compatible to previous nodes. There won’t be a major issue. Any code has risks, can you call BU risk-free? It depends on the level of risk. Segwit SF is acceptable, at most rolling back to 0.13.0, and segwit can increase little by little, not a sudden change. BU’s HF is different, with risks of splitting the entire ecosystem.
5)	Miners have freedom of voting, but do consider the interests at large. You must represent the interests of the entire ecosystem, at least try to. We need decentralized nodes and unified ecosystem. SF segwit needs to be activated under consensus, and we can wait. HF needs even greater consensus or we risk losing it all. If we cannot have enough consensus for either HF or SF segwit, then we should let the SF segwit happen, since it has no risks of destruction.

Maybe I wrote it in bad order, let me edit it in the future. Don’t jump to conclusion OP. Segwit should be activated in the future.



 **Support**

**gjw**   
Core knows nothing about the spirit of contract. They ignore their public ann. a few months ago. A direct scaling is the simplest and most effective way of solving our urgent problem. Why roll out this thing that requires long-time testing?
To have a worldwide success for Bitcoin, you need to provide ppl with access at low costs. It’s just like Internet. Core either has a vicious intention or has no faith in Bitcoin. If one day Bitcoin is being used by 9 digits of ppl, the main chain block size cannot be enough even at 100 MB. Micro payment still needs to go through something like LN. What’s the meaning of keeping the block size at 1MB?
7 years ago the block size was set at 1MB, what’s the hardware like 7 years ago? What the growth of bandwidth and storage in 7 years? 10 years or 20 years from now?
The main battlefield of Bitcoin is in China. We Chinese ppl should not be satisfied with mining a few coins or gamble on a few exchanges. Take the responsibility and obligation of contribution. But, words are so much cheaper than codes. We need advanced devs for the main battlefield.


**changyong**
I appreciate Jiang Zhuo’er’s main points, they coincide with my opinions on the Chengdu blockchain conference:
1. scaling, segwit and LN should all be implemented.
2.it is highly wrong to make the main chain a settlement network
3. LN and the main chain are for different purposes and should not be inter-placeable.
4. main chain jam is driving towards LN Matthew Effect and monopolies.
5. miner decision is most rational and trust-worthy
6. tech and propaganda monopolies are endangering the whole system
7. SF increases long-term systemic debt and risks

A supplementary 8 points
1. blocksize cannot meet with the market demand for a long time---this is no less significant of a tech loophole. So a HF is a worthy action.
2. HF is an important instrument for Bitcoin to metabolize. Demonizing HF is suicidal.
3. The lack of incentives for devs and the centralization of tech are the paramount systemic risks at this moment
4. BU is a good start for competition, which will eliminate tech centralization.
5. HF scaling will not change the current landscape of profits and power, turning the main chain into a settlement network will. The latter carries great risks of Bitcoin failure.
6. Demonizing HF is a coverup for the changes and risks associated with the settlement network roadmap.
7. Democracy of Bitcoin requires ration, not loyalty and passion from the Bitcoiners, else, we are en route dictatorship.
8. For the sake of the wealth and energy you put into this, plz resort to reason, not blind worshipping and personal attacks.

**myx**
If you can compete with confidence, do compete under the same level of consensus.
Bitcoin is the flapship of cryptos. An easy HF and an influential forked chain in the aftermath can be catastrophic. Miners can benefit in the short run after the spilitting. But in the long run, we all lose. A lowered threshold in anticipation of an easier fork is much worse than staying put.
Based on Boss Jiang’s statement, 95% consensus can produce a 5% forked chain...then there will always be minority miners forking. In the end, the recognition of Bitcoin comes from users. Self-important forks by some miners are nothing but Alts. We have enough alts, no? So, 95%+ consensus is the only way to maintain unification. A coin without support from most of the users is an alt!
Miners do get to decide, but the ultimate right is with the users’ recognition! If a 95%+ consensus is with a solution, then the rest minority do not matter. So, a solution without a high degree of consensus in a way is splitting the ecosystem. If BU dares not to bring up a 95% threshold, and in your own words, if a 51% HF is enough for a HF...you will end up splitting the ecosystem!
Boss Jiang is a miner, and he feels he’s investing bigly, and he gets to decide. But in fact you are just for profit, not some Samaritan. Miners are just making profits on the most-recognized coin. Nothing to do with ethics. But a fair competition, by your own words, must be on the same criteria. Just like the 270 electoral votes in US presidential election. A common threshold.
So, if BU wants to compete with segwit, do so under the same level of consensus. Any solution under a 95% consensus is just trolling for your own cowardice!

**indexindex**
The scaling debate involves 1)scaling for Bitcoin’s future and 2)breaking dev monopoly. Dev is the easiest part to control than hashing powers and users, literally the weakest part in the decentralization course of Bitcon.
Spend 7 or 8 digits of USD on core devs, then you can control a multi-billion level product...that’s a good bargin for numerous capitals.
Devs must realize that they can be abandoned should they do harm to Bitcoin in exchange of their own interests. Not just Core, but every dev team should understand this. BS’ investment must go burn, so as to make it a good example for future players.

personalfinance,Need Help/Advice with Student Loans! (already tried /r/studentloans to no help),"Hey guys, been looking at this subreddit for a while and trying to get my head around some of the ins and outs of these student loans. Getting a bit of knowledge but now that I am coming face to face with mine.. I need some help if anyone can.
I went to a public university in New Jersey (probably easy to guess - RU!) for 5 years and have accumulated some loans, which I'm sure we all have lol.
I just graduated in May 2016, so my grace period is about to end. Last year, I worked as a restaurant server while in school and am still doing that currently. I have a major in accounting/finance, and am hoping to acquire a job in that field in the next 6 months, with a starting salary around $50k-$60k, with a ceiling in the next decade that is TBD.
Here is my loan breakdown: Loan Balance - $33,803 @ Interest Rate - 4.470%
Direct link to all the types: http://imgur.com/wYC0Ltd
At this point, my question is basically what is my best approach to taking down these loans? I am about to post the results from the ""Repayment Estimator"" on studentloans.gov.. with an Adjusted AGI of ~$6,000 (because I was a restaurant server last year) in NJ with a family size of 1 (myself).
Repayment Estimate Calculator: http://imgur.com/o3xCzkM
As you can see, I can make monthly payments of $339/month for 10 years and be done with it, paying roughly $41k in total when all is said and done.
However, the REPAYE and IBR options say I can pay only $0 at the moment, while of course extending my repayment period.
To keep in mind... I am hoping to be employed in the finance/accounting field soon making much more income. I can also technically make the $339/month payments starting even now with my server income, but it obviously takes a toll on my budgeting. Despite the fact that I can pay it and will be able to in the future with a ""real job,"" I am willing to make ""extra"" payments later on to finish it in 5 years or so if I can. However, cash is king... and if there is a way that REPAYE or IBR can have any of my loans forgiven as the calculator suggests, I would obviously want to pay LESS money, even if it extends my repayment period in the long run.
Just looking for your guys' thoughts on this topic. Thanks in advance!!!
P.S.:
This is a side topic, but a friend of mine (also in the finance/accounting field and not in the public sector), has loans but was pursued by my-nsls to help ""process his loans."" Through reading this subreddit, I have learned myself not to pay roughly ~$600 in fees to a company to handle my loans because I can ""do it all myself.""
However, I am puzzled at what they have promised him. Though I do not know all of his variables like I do mine, I know he has more debt ($47,000 from a college in NJ that wasn't RU), and that he is not public sector. However, they have promised him loan forgiveness after TEN years, and he is only making monthly payments of $105/month.. (after a $600 fee of course lol). However, he is making that monthly payment while pulling a $70k/year salary. Furthermore, I saw on his fedloan.org site that the repayment term is indeed 135 months (I THOUGHT income based driven bumped it up to 20 years???). Lastly, his loan is currently in ""forebearance,"" which I do not know if it is good or bad.
Once again, this is a side topic that does not have to do with my situation but I just wanted some clarity regarding it. Thanks!!",finance,1480019187

Is there any reason why my federal loans would be in my dad's name?","So I'm a little in debt, to the tune of 80k in student loans, 50k in private and 30k in federal. I have enough income to pay for the minimum and live comfortably by myself; my rent is cheap, my job is really close to where I live, no car payments yet, so everything is looking good at the moment. But, my dad is trying to refinance his house and other things, and because he cosigned for my loans, the loans show up on his credit report, and his interest rates are kinda terrible. I'm trying to remove my dad's name from as much of it as possible by consolidating only in my name. I have gotten 30k out of 50k of my private loans only in my name through consolidation (and my rate was almost halved :D). This leaves 20k in private loans in his name (that can have his name removed in a year) and 30k more in federal loans. For some reason, the federal loans are showing up on my dad's credit report, and I am at a loss in how to remove his name from them. The loan servicer insists the only name on the federal loan is mine, but my dad is saying it's affecting his credit score. I've looked everywhere and asked everyone I could why this would be, but no one has a good answer. I filled out the FAFSA form to receive the federal loans, and I don't remember having him cosign or do anything, really.

personalfinance,"25, Canadian and just got a job with one of the big 4 in tech. Questions about taxes in USA, budgeting, and loan repayment.","Hi PF.

I recently landed myself a Software development job with a company out of Seattle. While I'm very excited about this I have a ton of planning to do before I move. 
I've read that I would have to pay taxes first in the US and then (assuming Canadian taxes are higher) pay the difference to Canada. This seems to be dependent on residency status. Assuming I start in February or March would I not be considered a US resident for spending more than 183 days in the USA? 
&gt; Significant ties to Canada include things like having a spouse in Canada, a Canadian driver's license, bank accounts or property in Canada and staying in Canada for 183 days or more in the year.  

I have a Canadian drivers license, is that weighted higher than the number of days spent in a country?
Another thing I'll need to do is build my US credit from zero. I bank with TD Canada and while they have an American version, TD Bank, I don't think they operate in WA. From the quote above it might be better to just close my Canadian bank accounts anyway.

For loan repayments, I have a $21,000(CAD) federal loan at 5.2% and a $17,000(CAD) provincial loan at 2.3%. I'm planning on paying back the federal loan ASAP but I don't mind paying the minimum on the provincial loan since the rate is so low. 

As for my offer and budget, I'm looking at a salary of $110,000 (USD) and signing+relocation bonus of $31,000(USD). I plan to use the bonus for first months rent and damage deposit which is looking to be around $3,600-$5,000. I'm torn between using the leftover money to immediately pay off my federal loan or establish a 6 month emergency fund. Or maybe 3 month emergency fund and take a chunk out of that federal loan. 

As for budgeting my first draft looks like this:

* Rent $2,200 - $2,600 (I've been looking at small houses in and around Seattle)
* Util $300 (this is close to what I pay in Canada, but I expect it to be less in Seattle especially in winter)
* Internet $100
* Phone $40
* Food $ 450
* Home $ 740 (My girlfriend is currently finishing her first year teaching and I plan to help her out with rent and util, technically I'm on the lease until August)
* Total $3,830 - $4,230

For the leftover, I'm planning on opening and putting 1k towards a 401k until I hit the 9k match max. There should be enough left over to hit at least the minimums on the student loans until then. 

Transportation should be covered by the company. Does this look reasonable? 

Also, I'm guessing my CAD student loan tax credits won't be useful in the USA? Any advice or pointers or things I might have overlooked would be extremely appreciated. Thanks very much.",finance,1480035978

personalfinance,"20k in debt repayment plan advice, where to allocate extra money (CAN)","After poor choices in my early twenties and a partner who encouraged these poor choices, I've ended my relationship and am finding myself about 20k in debt + tax debt. I'm now in my early thirties and I'd like to get this paid of for good. Spending habits have changed, I use mint for budgeting and I am able to stay within my budget.

I will make about 50k this year, and each year it seems to go up by 10% or so. I work on a commission basis, used to be self-employed and am now employed. During my early years of being self-employed I was not smart about my finances and didn't put away enough money for taxes and always found myself in a viscous cycle of paying back my taxes. Now, being an employee I will no longer be in this crazy cycle because my taxes are being deducted from my paycheque. 

My agreement with the CRA is to pay back $700/month which will be fully paid off in 1.5 years, and I am paying another $700/month on my paying off my debts (largest sum going towards highest interest rate at 13.9%) 

Earlier this year I sat down with a financial adviser and applied for a consolidation loan with an interest rate of 2.5%. I was accepted but only on the condition that I had no outstanding taxes owed. My plan is once my taxes are paid off, I will get this loan and will be able to pay it off in no time. 

So here's my question. Sometimes I have money left over at the end of the month. Is it smarter for me to use that extra money to pay back my taxes faster so that I can get the low-interest rate loan sooner, or would it be a better idea for me to put the extra money towards my credit cards with a higher interest rate?",finance,1480045901

personalfinance,Mortgage refinancing with secured LOC,"Hello all...need some advice...

My wife and I  have a home worth $422k with a mortgage (3.1%) currently at $278k.  Attached to the mortgage is a HELOC with a 28k balance (3.7%).

We also have an unsecured LOC (5.5℅) with a balance of 8k at another bank.

I own a small corporation with a 19k secured operating LOC to my home equity. 

Our current mortgage is up for renewal next year (november 2017).  

We would like to refinance (break penalty $1700) and add the personal HELOC and unsecured LOC onto my new mortgage to increase monthly cash flow.  We would close the RBC LOC and decrease our HOLOC to 8k.  

I have shopped around and found a broker who can get me a rate of 2.24% 5 yr fixed. 

I approached my (credit union) bank and asked them if they could come close to the brokers rate. There posted rate is 3.49% 5yr fixed.  They came back with a rate of 2.5% blended. 

She then proceeded to tell me that my personal and corporate LOC would need to be paid in full and closed if I chose to pay out my mortgage with them.  I asked if it could be secured with the new mortgage and she told me no. 

 I have all my personal and corporate banking with this bank and need the operating LOC to remain active. Is this a standard practice or is there really not a way for them to resecure it with a new lender?

personalfinance,The gravity of my situation has finally settled in and I'm starting to freak out.,"I've always been a lurker in this thread because I try to keep thoughts about money on the backburner as much as I can. It's lengthy, so I'll make a tl;dr, but I would really appreciate it if some of you guys would read my story.

I flunked out of college after my first year straight out of high school in 2012, having everything covered completely by federal loans which put me at about $18,000 (tuition + room and board for 2 semesters).

I was extremely overweight and unmotivated at this time and regret my miserable attempt at being a college student. I then went through a strange period where I made several half hearted attempts at creating every possible hobby of mine into something profitable (gaming, art, music, food; nothing panned out because being largely unmotivated will, shockingly, do that).

Fast forward to 2014 and I'm working a crap job at a restaurant with a bunch of other big dudes, and one day, one of them comes up with the idea of doing a workplace weight loss challenge. We all throw in $50 into a jar and whoever loses the most body fat % by a certain date gets it all.

I won, and not only did I win, but I RAN with it. After a certain point, I became obsessed with health and fitness and the world of nutrition, and I essentially became a different person. I was the happiest I've ever been, realized that a dead end restaurant job was definitely NOT what I wanted to do with my life, and decided to go back to school in 2015 to obtain a degree in dietetics.

Unfortunately, my GPA was absolutely trashed from my first year, and I didn't qualify for ANY form of financial aid--not even from the private loan companies. (Which, in retrospect, is probably a good thing, considering I hear their interest rates are ridiculous).

Fortunately, however, I'm lucky enough to have an amazing mother who was gracious enough to dip into her retirement fund to pay for that first semester back at college straight out of pocket, but only if I knew that it was right for me and also if I agreed to pay her back. ""This is the one and only time I'm able to do this! Everything here on out is up to you now!""

I kicked ass that semester, was able to bring my GPA back up to an acceptable level for federal loans, and I have now transferred schools where they actually offer dietetics.

Only 6 credit hours transferred. I'm roughly $24,000 in debt already and I only have 6 credits to show for it.

Dietitians in America are required to have a masters degree to qualify for a clinical position. Ok, so let's see what I'm working with here!

~$6,000 per semester for 12 credit hours. I need 70 to obtain my bachelor's (I think). Counting the $24,000 I used just to put me at 6, I need $32,000 more to get me to 70. And I'm only halfway there. Cool.

Oh, and by the way, losing all that weight? It left me with the excess skin thing. Everywhere. It sucks and I want it removed. Getting a full body lift can cost upwards of $50,000. I'm not budging on this subject either; it's seriously affecting my quality of life and if I have to choose between hating my body forever or dealing with even more debt, I guess I'd go with the debt.

So, calculating student loans plus interest for a master's degree to get a job whose median salary in the U.S. is about 50k to 60k a year, piled on top of a ridiculously overpriced surgical procedure, puts me at a how-the-fuck-am-I-ever-going-to-have-a-normal-life amount of debt, and I frankly have no idea what to do with myself.

I feel like being a dietitian is what seems right for me as of right now, but all of this is seriously making me reconsider my life choices. Do I tough it out and try to do what I can in the meantime? Switch majors to something more accessible? Get out while I can and become a coke dealer?

Joking, but seriously this is all making my head spin and I just want to curl up in a ball and have someone tell me everything is going to be okay when I almost feel like for a fact it is absolutely not.

tl;dr - I'm a 23 year old born-again college student with $24,000 of debt with almost nothing to show for it whatsoever. I'm working a minimum wage part time job with 0 dollars in my savings, living off of student loans with additional plans to have a $50,000 ""cosmetic"" surgical procedure in the near future, who realized I am quickly going to have to deal with $125,000+ of debt if I don't figure something realistic out now.

Anyone who reaches out to me about this, I thank you in advance. Seriously. I just sort of need a voice of reason right now and any little bit of advice will help.",finance,1480053842
investing,Ray Dalio &amp; Bill Gross offer different takes on the markets under a Trump presidency,"Last week, [Bill Gross of Janus Capital](https://www.janus.com/insights/bill-gross-investment-outlook) and [Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflections-trump-presidency-one-week-after-election-ray-dalio?trk=prof-post) had conflicting views on what the near future of investing will look like. 

Mr. Gross is quite pessimistic on the outlook, suggesting that lower corporate taxes and heavy government spending will end up not in the hands of middle America but rather go toward propping up the markets and driving prices higher - which will eventually backfire, lowering GDP growth and quickly driving the country into an inflation-fueled recession. 

Mr. Dalio, in contrast, suggests that the Trump picks so far seem to have a good understanding of how to walk the fine economic line and ""probably won't recklessly and stupidly drive the economy into a ditch"". From an economic standpoint, he says, this major shift from increased globalization, free trade, and weak fiscal policy to decreased globalization, decreased free trade, and aggressive fiscal policy will drive up interest rates, increase dollar prices, and spur domestic growth. In the markets, this means that bond prices **decrease** and stock prices and the dollar **increase**. 


From an economic standpoint, these are basically two sides to the same idea: The presidency will either be good on timing and this growth period will be appropriately managed, or aggressiveness will breed that stupidity (that Dalio thinks will be avoided) and end up reversing any good it has caused, driving the country fairly quickly (i.e., 1-2 quarters into the presidency) into a recession.

financialindependence,Input on emergency savings,"I've always been very risk averse. I like to consider what could reasonably go wrong in my life and do what I can to prepare for it. My job is very secure and I perform very well, so I am not concerned about job loss under normal conditions (and if so, in addition to emergency savings, I could withdraw money from my portfolio or even sell my house if need be). My major concern would be a recession that hits the stock market, housing market, and leaves me jobless. Under this situation, my portfolio maybe wouldn't get me too far, I would be unable to sell my house if needed, and I would have a very difficult time finding a new job. This would mean that I would have to rely on my emergency savings until things turned around.

For this reason, I think that I should have at least 1 year worth of emergency savings, but would like 2. I could have this in an ally savings account (1%), the Vanguard GNMA Fund Investor Shares (VFIIX) fund (or maybe this would be a bad idea for the moment since rates have further to go up than down), or at a credit union that offers a comparatively good interest rate.

I understand why the FIRE community does not like too much in emergency savings - that money would do much more for me over the long term if invested. However, if such a worst case scenario as described does occur, I would stand to lose a lot of money if, for example, I couldn't make my mortgage payment. Note that I will still be maxing out my retirement account and investing in a Vanguard index fund/making extra mortgage payments.

personalfinance,401k loan vs. HELOC for short term loan,"My family is purchasing a new house and because we have young kids and keeping a house in showing condition is impossible, we opted not to sell our current house until after we have moved.  

So, that will leave us with two mortgages which is fine but we want to keep as much cash in our savings account as possible so its there for emergencies and/or for necessary costs to get our current house in condition to sell.  

That led us to these two borrowing options for the downpayment on the new house which can be repaid in full once the first house is sold.  We're assuming 6-12 months to move, prepare, sell.

* 401k loan.  4.5% paid to myself.  5 year term, but I can pay it in full once the first house is sold.  Larger monthly payment, but it's manageable.  I understand I'd miss out on market gains while the loan is being repaid, but the short term nature of the loan makes me wonder if maybe I shouldn't be too concerned about that.

* HELOC.  There's enough equity in our current home to pay with a good chunk of the downpay.  My employer (a bank) has an introductory interest rate of 2.5% for 12 months.  Interest only payments, tax deductible.

I think both options have about the comparable setup/closing costs, not more than a couple hundred dollars.

personalfinance,Personal Finance cheat sheet,"As 2016 winds down, many of you are are prepping for midterms and finals, trying to cram complex topics onto a single 3x5 card.  (Many others are celebrating not having to worry about these any more!)  Readers of this forum are likewise looking for ways to summarize personal finance knowledge.   A holiday gift to you follows: Personal Finance Spark Notes! Some of the key organizing ideas behind personal finances are listed below.  Details have been omitted to focus on key ideas.  

1.  *""I am indeed rich, since my income is superior to my expenses, and my expense is equal to my wishes."" -Edward Gibbon.*   You need to have more income than expenses; ideally, a lot more income than expenses.   This is your primary personal finance goal.  Your credit score, or your 401k choices, or your travel rewards, or your savings account interest rate are just small parts of that overall landscape.  Don't let yourself get so distracted chasing small gains that you lose sight of this big picture.  

2. *""A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of."" -Jane Austen.*  Actively seek out higher income if you find yours is not yet adequate.  Make yourself more valuable by learning valuable skills.  Seek out employers who will pay you to use them.  That usually means job changes, rather than getting a 5% raise from your current employer.  For more income if you have more time than money, look into second / part-time jobs.  When  you have more money than time, look into investments.

3.  *""Action expresses priorities."" -Mahatma Gandhi.*  Money you spend for one thing is unavailable for anything else, so spend wisely and focus on your top priorities.   Your rent / housing cost matters.  Your car costs matter.  The sum of your recurring monthly bills matters.  If you don't know what you spend today, that's the first thing to address.  Once you know that, you can make adjustments, perhaps by sharing housing expenses, reducing transportation costs, or saving on utilities and insurance.

4.  *""Never spend your money before you have it."" -Thomas Jefferson.*  Most bad personal finance situations happen because people take on more debt than they can afford.  While some debts like modest student loans and mortgages are low risk, running up credit card bills or big car payments is often a prelude to hardship.   Spend within your means; pay back your debts; pay your credit card bill in full every month; save for big purchases and emergencies.  

5.  *""“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world."" -Albert Einstein.*  Investments in well-understood products like equity index funds can produce very large returns  if you make regular contributions and allow them to grow for decades.   This is why we recommend 401k and IRA investments for people early in their careers.  Short-term investments (less than five years) will likely have only modest gains, or even no gains at all.

6.  *""By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."" -Benjamin Franklin.*  Bad things happen.  What would happen if you were in a car accident and and couldn't work for weeks?  Could you replace your transportation, pay the hospital, and handle the lost income?  Make sure you have adequate insurance for foreseeable risks, including car accidents, plumbing leaks,  medical bills, and loss of income.   

7.   *""We shape our dwellings, and afterwards our dwellings shape us."" -Sir Winston Churchill.*   Your housing needs should reflect your lifestyle, not just your monthly payments.   Buy a house because you plan to make it your home indefinitely,  when you are ready for the responsibilities of homeownership.  Financial return is a complicated topic that depends on many factors, but longer-term ownership favors buying vs. renting in the majority of cases.   

8.  *""The most important thing for a young man is to establish a credit... a reputation, character."" -John D. Rockefeller.*  You establish a credit history so people will trust you in the future when you want to lease an apartment or buy a house.   You want to think long-term here, rather than focusing on short-term fluctuations.  Don't pay interest just to establish credit, and don't lose sleep over ten-point changes in your credit score  

9.  *""Speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest."" -Warren Buffett.*  There are many investment ideas that assume increasing asset prices, such as can't-miss stock picks, limited-supply cyber currencies, essential precious metals, or hot housing markets.   This works great...until it doesn't.  You can pay to play, but winning isn't guaranteed.  Don't risk money you can't afford to lose.  

10.  *""If you count all your assets, you always show a profit.""  -Robert Quillen.*  Your attitude is key to happiness.  Take time to appreciate the things you do have, even when it's tempting to focus only on those that you don't.   If you're reading this, then you have much to be thankful for.   Best of luck to you in the future!",finance,1480098048
personalfinance,Student Loan Debt Consolidation?,"Hi All, 
First time posting here, so please bear with me if I'm missing any information. Long story short, my parents and I split my student loans 70 me / 30 them after I graduated a BS/MS program. My father had a stroke some years back so all loans fell out of his name and only in my mother's. He has been unable to contribute and now my mother is in danger of losing her home because of poor financial decisions outside of the student loans. 

I want to know if it is a good idea to consolidate the current Federal loans I have, along with one of the Private loans she is paying, with a private institution in order to reduce my payments and some of the stress on her. I cannot outright pay for both or even one of the loans she is paying, but below are the loan details I have:

My loans:

-DIRECT SUB CONSOLIDATION LOAN, Federal, Balance: 20,288.05, 6.5% Fixed, $203.17 monthly

-DIRECT UNSUB CONSOLIDATION LN, Federal, Balance: $26,581.79, 6.5% Fixed, $266.32 monthly

-NM YESCHIN LOAN, Balance: $2,181.00, 0% Fixed, $50.00 monthly

and the loan I would possibly acquire:

-NAVIENT PRIVATE LOAN TRUST, Balance: $59,265.94, 3.0% Fixed,  $262.44 monthly

I can't afford almost $800/month in student loans, and I'm not sure the best direction to go. Any and all input would be most appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1480100588

personalfinance,"2 Credit Cards, which to pay first? (Interest similar)","I'm sure this is a common question, but I find it hard to find the words to use in a word search.

I have 2 credit cards carrying balances on them.

First card has a lower interest rate of 12.99% with roughly $4,000 balance. It has a higher minimum payment of about $126.

Second card has a lightly higher APR of 17.49% with roughly $2,500. It has a lower minimum payment of $64.

I recently came into a windfall of $2,000 that I plan to use to pay down one of the cards. Does the rule of paying the card with the highest interest rate still apply when I'm trying to get a little more relief from minimum payments so I can hopefully pay a larger amount each month?

I know the choice might be obvious, but I'm hoping for a little more insight. The first card with the higher balance, but lower interest rate is with a smaller bank that doesn't have it set up to more easily make payments from a different bank.

Update: Thanks for the help guys. I appreciate your input. I went ahead and put the money towards the second card with higher interest. No point in waiting longer since each month I am accumulating more interest.",finance,1480104104
personalfinance,Considering bankruptcy or just blowing off credit card dept. Thoughts?,"Ok so blowing off the credit card is probably a bad idea, but at this point I am seriously considering bankruptcy as an option which I never thought I would do. Here is my situation:


I'm 33 years old, married with two young kids under 4. I was laid off 6 years ago and used it as a chance to switch careers into IT. It was the best move I have made and my salary has been increasing ever since but being on unemployment 6 years ago killed me and the salary cut that I took from switching careers has hurt ever since then. My salary is finally creeping back up now but I built up so much debt that I really feel overwhelmed. If I didn't have the weight of this CC debt around my neck I feel like I would be in decent shape but I pay the minimums and extra when I can, but I feel like I will never pay anything off or it will be a decade before I do. I'm worried that as my kids start to get older and start school etc. they will get more expensive and I will start falling behind again. I am not putting anything away for retirement. I would be able to do all of these things without this damn debt. I have about 23,000 in debt. If I add up all my minimum payments they come to around $600 or so per month and it hurts knowing that the money could go into savings and retirement etc. At the same time, I did run up this debt in the first place and I feel a responsibility to pay it back. The interest is just absolutely killing me and making me feel like there is no way I will get out. OK sorry for the rant. Here are my details:


We clear $4,000 per month. My expenses are $3,600 per month, that's bills, mortgage, the credit card minimums etc. That only leaves $400 extra per month and it usually gets swallowed up by home or car maintenance or some other unforeseen thing that pops up.


This is my credit card debt:

* card 1: $15,600 owed 15.5% APR $312 minimum payment
* card 2: $5,270 owed 24.24% APR $160 minimum payment
* card 3: $920 owed 17.99% APR $60 minimum payment
* card 4: $890 owed 17.24 APR $25 minimum payment

* Card 5: I charge things to this card during the month but pay in full at the end of the month so I do not pay interest. All of the above cards are just carrying balances but not used.


I know I should be paying off card 2 first and the minimums on all the rest, but I still feel like I'm not making a dent. I am not buying a new house anytime in the near future. So I am not sure if I should really worry about my credit. It is already in bad shape (around 600 - 650). I know that bankruptcy stays on your report for 7 years? I feel like I will be paying off these cards for longer than that amount of time anyway. Do I declare bankruptcy? Do I just stop paying? I live in PA and I heard that PA has very strict guidelines for being able to garnish wages and that credit card debt does not qualify. What are the chances I would be sued if I stopped paying? What happens if they do sue and win since they cant garnish my wages? They can garnish my bank account but I read somewhere that they almost never garnish a joint account so couldn't I protect my money that way? I don't know what to do. Rereading this post it really sounds like I am trying to weasel out of my financial responsibility. I would really rather find some way to pay back what I owe but with these interest rates I just feel like I have no shot. Any thoughts?

Additional info on budget:

personalfinance,Total Loss Car Insurance Questions,"Throwaway.

I was in a car accident a few days ago, and heard back on Tuesday that the car was totalled.  The car inspector said that another person, a total loss adjuster, would tell me how much I would get for the (former) car and what the next steps would be.  My claims adjuster was on vacation this week, and I haven't heard from the total loss adjuster yet.  

I think I can get a better deal on my replacement car this weekend for black friday than next weekend.  Is this reasonable?  I won't be able to transfer the insurance over until Monday at the earliest, so will there be an issue with driving the car uninsured on Sunday and Monday morning, and not having documentation until they can mail it?  Will there be an issue with the insurance dealing with the claim from the previous car while they set up the policy for the new to me car?

This will also be my first car loan.  I could drain my emergency fund to buy a car and pay cash, but I think it would be better to get a loan and pay it off over the course of a year.  I plan to get a pre-approval from my bank, and see if the dealership can beat their financing.  Is there anything else I should know about car loans?  (I do know how interest rates and making monthly payments work, and my credit is pretty good from revolving credit).

Loan started in May I have 11,600 dollars left to pay on it because I have been paying every extra dollar I have towards the car. I talked to a dealer and he said the car model I have is trading at 8-9K currently.

~$4750 in Roth IRA

~$2500 in Series EE bonds (current value) with interest rates of either 4% or 1.24%

Debt:

~$100k student loans (all fed) ranging from 4.5-6.8%

Plan:

Okay, so I am starting my career in Spring 2017 in a secure job making good money.  I am also buying my first house in the same time period.  My family's income this year will be in the 15% tax bracket (0% capital gains).  The following two years we will be in the 25% and 28% brackets respectively (15% capital gains).  

I am planning on liquidating all three of the assets listed above.  The stock and the bonds before the first of the year in order to benefit from the lower tax rates (0% for the stock and 15% for the bond interest).  Since I am purchasing my first house, I can cash out my Roth IRA without penalty as well once I get closer to closing.  I have the cash for the down payment without doing any of the above, but by cashing out I can make a significant dent in my loans with the highest interest rates as well.  

My logic is that I can get a guaranteed return &gt;6% by paying down my loans while I get 4% on the bonds and who knows in the IRA.  Further, I lose 15% overnight if I wait until 2017 or later to sell the stock.  It could be years before the value of the stock makes that up.

personalfinance,"Hey, PF. I left university this fall to help my family and now I want to go back for good. The only problem is I owe the university $2,500, I have no car, I owe $5,500 in student loans and I'm pretty much on my own financially. Sorry for the slightly coherent wall of text.","First, a little background just so you all know where I'm coming from. My senior year of high school started during the fall of 2014 and that's when I got my first job. Throughout my senior year, I never really saved any money and used it on my family. I thought university would be covered completely given my family was not well off. I also thought I wouldn’t need a car given I would be at university and if I needed a ride home for breaks I could ask my family.

Fast forward to the fall of 2015 and I start off university with $800 in my bank account. Federal aid covered most of my expenses although I had to decline all of my parent PLUS loans. I wasn’t going to put that burden on anyone. My mom hasn’t had a job in over 4 years and relied on my two younger brothers SSI checks. She has also had a drug problem for the last 3 years. That left me $1,500 short each semester which I supplemented with a part time job.

Come the summer of 2016 and I’ve finished my first year of university. I was home for the summer and couldn’t wait for the fall. Once the fall of 2016 came I went back to university, but immediately withdrew and went back home. My mom was in jail and our house was being foreclosed. Yeah, I thought she had everything covered given she was receiving the two SSI checks for my younger brothers. It turns out one of the SSI checks was cancelled during the fall 2015 and she has been foregoing the mortgage payments. She also has at least $20,000 in general debt.

So, I come back and get her out of jail. I’m also paying the half of bills with my fast food job. And the other half with one SSI check. She refuses to get a job and refuses to go to rehab. My aunt has been begging her to go to rehab. I can’t take it anymore. I have to leave. I’m going to claim my younger brothers on the spring of 2017 tax return (the spring of 2016 I claimed them and received $8,521 which went to my mom minus my $1,000 from my job and the $1,521 she gave me). With some of that money I plan on buying a used car.

**Question 1: Do I even give my mom any of the money?**

Once I get my car I’m going to get my own apartment. My younger brothers are going to live with my aunt.  If she doesn’t get a job she is going to lose the house once I leave. I hope you guys don’t judge me for leaving her in that position, but if she doesn’t want to better her life that’s her problem. I really do empathize and sympathize with lots of things I see in everyday life and it hurts me to do something like that. But, I have to move on with my life.

Ok, so initially I went to university because I wanted to study pure mathematics and do research. That is my first passion in life. This whole experience made me want to go back to university to study computer science. That is my second passion. With a CS degree, I believe I can land a decent paying job and its more versatile than my original pure math degree. I also only have to study for 4 years opposed to 8. This lets me start my life as soon as possible. Ultimately, I would like to live in Austin or Los Angeles doing software development
.
Problem 1: My first problem is no car, but that can be solved with the tax return.
 
Problem 2: My next problem is that I owe UT $2,500, but that could also possibly be solved with the tax return. Right now, they have me on a 15-month payment plan paying $155 per month. I’m going to check with UT to see if I can still go back with this debt if I continue paying it monthly.  If not I will plan on getting a higher paying job to pay it off as soon as possible.

Problem 3: I owe $5,500 in federal loans that are deferred until the fall of 2017. If I end up back at school the fall of 2017, I think this will not matter. If not, the money below accounts for the needed payments ($70/month).

Problem 4: I don’t want to work during university as I want to focus completely on my studies. When I was working part time I ended my first year with an ok gpa, but it was not ideal trying to study and work at the same time. This leaves me needing $28,384 or $14,192 per semester if I want to go to school without working. This includes money needed to stay in Austin during the summer months. My last FAN was for $25,128 subtracting the parent PLUS loans leaves me at $22,815. Leaving me to find $5,569. This is manageable if I work part time during the school year and full time during the summer, but I really can’t deal with working during school.

**Question 2: How easy/hard would it be to get approximately a $6,000 private loan with no credit history and no cosigner? What if they give me less aid and I need a higher private loan? How long would it take to build a good enough credit for private loans if I got a CC right now?**

Ultimately, I could stay in my home town, teach myself CS, make a good portfolio and start looking for jobs in Austin and LA. But, I really loved my first-year university experience and would also like to be formally taught CS instead of me buying books and watching YouTube videos.

personalfinance,High Interest Car Loan - Seeking Guidance,"I was desperate and low on cash and needed a vehicle to commute to and from work. I ended up with a car and a 29.99% interest rate... I paid the minimum payment on it for a year and low and behold the car needed repairs that I didn't have enough money to cover so I put another $1,000 back into the loan. 

My question is... how do I get back into a better car situation? The car is a 2004 Acura TL nearing 199k miles. My unpaid principle balance on the loan is $8,311. In the last year of making all my payments on time I've improved my credit score up to the 590's (which I know is far from stellar). 

Kelly Blue Book suggests the following values for the car in ""good"" condition. 
Trade-In: $1,967
Private-Party Sale: $3,043

I have made a basic budget my income is $1,600/month. Expenses (car payment, car insurance, cell phone, student loans, rent) equate to around $1,200/month. I get paid on a weekly basis which has proven to be difficult for me to figure out how to manage. 

I am frustrated and feel hopeless. I look at my debt and finances and get lost in a downward spiral of depression and feeling like I'll never get out of this hole. I made a lot of mistakes when I was younger by losing jobs and just letting things go to collections and not really realizing how much of a living hell it would make my life later. 

Is there any hope for trading this car in and getting something else? Do I try and sell it and buy something with cash? What happens if I can't sell it for what I owe on the loan? Am I stuck paying the difference? Do I just keep the car and continue making payments and just hope it doesn't explode one day?",finance,1480149937
personalfinance,Car Buying Scenario - Looking for the Catch,"I have an 8 year old car that has been having little things go wrong here and there.  It is paid off, but I will need to put $1,200 into it in the next year between tires, brakes, and (known) repairs - about half its value.  We also have a newer car (car #2) that we are paying off a year early and still have about 16 payments left.

The local dealer is overstocked on a car that I like and is selling it for a good deal.  Additionally, they will finance the new car plus the payoff amount of car #2 then give us a check to pay off car #2 to maintain one car payment.  They told me that it is cleared with the bank since we have good credit and the financed amount is close to the car's MSRP (10% higher)

I have looked at the numbers and it seems to work out: I do not have to pay money into the old car (will be traded in), financing is a lower interest rate (0.9 vs 2.4), monthly payments will be less (though only $20), and the total money paid will be less than if we pay off the current car then buy another (even ignoring old car maintenance costs).  We would also be done with car payments a year earlier than waiting to pay off the car then starting a new car payment.

I know common advice (and my wife's preference) is to keep a paid-off car, but that is often because the new car adds cost.  What is the ""catch"" that I am missing?  This seems too good to be true.

I will definitely be getting gap insurance, but that cost should be offset by the fuel savings.  The only negative that I can determine is that we lose a 7-month ""grace period"" for skipping the current car payments since we are so far ahead.

Thanks!

**EDIT:** I am running off the assumption that I will need a new car in 2-3 years (basically waiting until car #2 is paid off)

MSRP: $41k - driving is one of my few escapes, and I have yet to find anything that I like for less
Purchase: $34k (minus trade)
Financed: $45k ($46.5k total payments)

Comparison math for the same car, same purchase price in 2 years and 0% interest shows $1k more out of pocket (I am assuming the old car is worth 60% of current value).  The delta goes up with more repairs, non 0%, etc. but I want to go by the harshest comparison.",finance,1480150264

To start, capturing and storing the carbon from coal combustion is estimated to consume 25 percent to 45 percent of the power produced, depending on the approach taken. 
That translates to not only higher prices for coal-generated electricity but also the need for more power plants to serve the same customer base. Other technologies designed to make carbon capture more efficient aren’t commercial at this point, and their full costs are unknown.
Altogether, the Energy Department estimates that wholesale electricity prices with the initial generation of CCS technology would be 70 percent to 80 percent higher than current coal-based power—which is already uncompetitive with natural gas, wind, or even new solar PV installations.

personalfinance,(CAN) Thoughts on car down payment?,"I've been saving up towards a down payment to buy a new Jeep Wrangler so that the monthly payments would be in a range I feel comfortable with, and I've finally reached the amount I felt I needed.

But now I'm second guessing if I should do that (the down payment, not buy the Jeep - I'm definitely doing that)  I'm rounding off the numbers slightly here but this is the thoughts I'm having:

-I have $15,000 to go towards the down payment. If I use it all, my monthly payment will be around $400.

-If I do not use my savings for a down payment, my payment will be around $700.

-I can afford a $700 a month payment but it would leave the rest of my budget tighter. (IE much smaller budget for impulse buys or extras).

-Making the down payment would drain my savings (This is separate from my Retirement savings which is a separate line on my budget so I'm not dipping into that at all)


What are your thoughts - should I make the down payment to have smaller monthly payments  or should I go for the higher monthly payment and use the savings to contribute $300ish a month to the car payment and leave myself with that nice safety net incase of change of life situation?  The interest rate is 3.49 at the moment from Chrysler (Actually through Royal Bank I think)

I looked into refinancing to a 15 yr loan but was told I would not get a better interest rate if I did that.

I would like to try to treat my 30 yr loan as a 15 yr loan or 20 year loan so that I save as much money as possible. Is there an online calculator you recommend or any other tips?

Also, just curious, is it possible to pay mortgage with a credit card in order to get the points/miles?

With a 72 month loan, I was getting offered about 6% (which isnt great for me)-- no hard pulls at this time, that was the ""estimate"" offer from the dealer

The finance guy told us we can always refinance after 12 months, and by that time my score will be much higher and I could get a much better rate... The salesman said (""off the record"") that he would take whatever interest rate we're given but he recommended a credit union that supposedly has very good rates.  He claimed that if I were to have a credit union, after 3 months or so (apparently my credit score will be climbing quite a bit by then?)  I could apply for a loan through them at a much lower rate and pay off my outstanding balance.. is that a good plan?  Should I not just go straight to a CU in the first place?

Also, my boyfriend has a very good credit score (770+) and is offering to cosign.. Is this a good idea?  Is there a difference in the benefits to my credit building?  (in other words, would I climb faster if I was by myself).. The dealer was also saying that if that's the route we plan on taking, my bf should be the primary and I should be the secondary (because apparently banks have become privy to this method, and realize the secondary person is usually the one backing the loan and therefore the secondary's credit gets the benefits?)... we're aware of the risks involved with going onto a loan together (this is his idea)- but in the first year alone, apparently I can be paying close to 2k in interest.. If I was to do this with my boyfriend, would it be smarter to just go through the dealers finance guy (who claimed to have access to 400 loaners) or through my bf's credit union (Consumers Credit Union)

Any help much appreciated!!!!

EDIT: one more comment-- this is somewhat time-sensitive, and I currently do not have access to a Credit Union..

personalfinance,Advice for an 18 year old college student,"As the title states, I am 18 and in college. Let me explain my situation. I don't attend a huge, fancy college that is already a black hole of debt for some of my friends, but community college. My state offers a free (tuition) community college program and along with that my parents' income qualifies me for even more assistance. I receive approximately $1500 in the form of a check from the FAFSA each term (3 terms). I am anticipating 0 debt after a year and a half of community college, then I will head off to a university. Schooling aside.

Currently I have approximately $6000 and a reliable car that I paid off in cash the day I drove off the lot. This subreddit and the lady at the bank convinced me to start building credit. So 4 months ago I acquired a ""college credit card."" From my understanding they aren't in it to screw me over but actually help me. Interest rate is relatively low, but that doesn't matter because I pay off the balance online right after I use the card. I've read that using half (or less) of your monthly cap benefits your credit score more than using 100% of our limit or using it to buy a candy bar every other month. I use about 40% of my limit each month, let me know if this is a wrongdoing, because I'm only four months in and could reverse my damages I hope.

My monthly expenses consist of rent, electricity, internet, and utilities. These all total up to $500 a month. I currently don't have a steady job. I maybe make $150 a month but am looking for a job. Meanwhile my parents and step-parents pitch in $150-$200 a month totaling up to $350-$400 which is really helpful. 

Even though these past 4 months living on my own has shown me a whole new side to life I never knew existed, I am adapting incredibly well. My money managing is really good I think. Spend about $150 on groceries a month and $30 on gas.

I have looked at the sidebar for what to do if you're between 15-20 and also the 18-25 section. As the 15-20 section states I should attend a CC to save money (done), fill out FAFSA (done), have a plan for my education (done), get a bank account in my own name (done), start building credit (done), get a job (eh, almost there), purchase a reliable car (done), and to get roommates to save on rent (done). And now as the 18-25 state I should manage debt (don't have any; done), invest (not done), explore retirement options (not currently doable), look into student loans (won't have debt until senior year), look into grad school (grad school is the plan), look into health insurance (on my parents), and save money (in the process).

Out of these two categories I would say I have a good grasp on 90% of the things that I can do with my current state. Investing is really the only topic that I see myself needing work on, but is that right? Surely there has to be other things I can do that slipped through the cracks. Ask away any other info you need to know to help me out, but other than investing what can I do to make sure I'm building a solid foundation for a financially sound rest of my life?",finance,1480238162

personalfinance,[Auto] Best way to manage my upside-down auto loan?,"Hello PF! Long time viewer here, I haven't posted much on Reddit but I wanted to see if I could get some advice. My goal is to free up as much cash flow as possible to reduce my overall debt.

A little bit about myself - I am in my late 20's, making around $75k/year (Around $2k per paycheck after taxes - one every 2 weeks) and have around $60k worth of debt including student loans/personal loans/ and the auto loan with around 10.5k in an auto loan. I am seriously considering buying a house within the next year or so, so I need my credit to be pretty healthy.

The debts take up almost $1200 of monthly payments, and I am on a quest to reduce that as much as possible so that I can snowball my debts off and free up as much cash flow as possible.

My main problem is that my current debt is $10.5k with a major bank and the value of the car is about $6k - $7k at best and is quickly depreciating in value. I have even seen similar cars on Craigslist (maybe in even better conditions with less miles) for around $3k-$4k.

Is there any reasonable way to improve my situation to increase cash-flow and reduce my payments?

I have thought asking around for a refinance to lower my payments and then use the extra cash-flow to pay off other debts that have higher interest rate etc. But I think my pros and cons are the following:

Pros:

* Lower monthly payment = more cash flow for other debts

Cons:

* Probably won't receive a better interest rate

* Don't want to do too many credit inquiries if I seriously want to buy a house in the near future

* Will extend the life of the loan

I have also considered seeing what type of trade-in I can get for the car to see if there is anyway they can put me in a cheaper car or another car that is less ""upside-down"".

I've tried doing some searching online and listening to podcasts etc. typically they say that best answer is to keep the car, but i'm not so sure in my situation.

I just graduated in June 2016 and am fortunate enough to have a pretty good job right after college. I work for a startup, $100k salary, w/ stock options, and decent healthcare. While our company is doing very well at the moment with no apparent signs of slowing down I do recognize the risk. I have a good chunk of student loan debt and I'm about to start paying it off. Here are my questions so far:

1. Wow taxes are expensive. Right now my take home is ~$5k/mo. That means after taxes I'm taking home ~~~$60k/yr, a 40% tax rate~~! (My rounding was too drastic, ~66k/yr, 33% tax rate) It seems like I'll be getting some money back come tax time at that rate but maybe I should declare more allowances so I can put the money to better use now? Also looking for any tips on taxes that I might be missing. 

2. I was approved for a student loan refi/consolidation. ~$58k @ 4.4% fixed rate (3.64% variable) 5 year term and then I have another $7k @ 3.86% of federal loans. The 5 year term seemed appealing at first because I want to pay off my student loan debt ASAP but that would mean my monthly payment on the larger amount is $1000/mo. I will likely be paying more than that most months to finish even faster (at least that was the plan) but if something were to happen like I lost my job I would be on the hook for a big monthly expense. Should I go for the longer term higher rate loan to reduce my risk or just refi again if something bad happens?

3. Retirement/Investing: So my employer doesn't offer a 401k, just stock options which I'm collecting over 4 years with monthly vesting (and 1 yr cliff). Who knows what these will be worth some day but I'm of course thinking I should be saving something now. My hunch says that of my $5k/mo I should put 25% into student loans (at least), 25% in to monthly expenses (that's about how much they are right now), and the remaining 50% into my future.

What do you recommend I do with my remaining $2.5k/mo after I build up my 3mo emergency fund? All in on paying off student loan debt fast? Vangaurd index funds? Save for a mortgage and rent it out? Thanks for the help!",finance,1480268313

I started a job last month paying $180,000 and would like any help as to what the best way to pay off my student debt is. 

I have a total of 6 gov't loans: 3 Direct Glad PLUS loans (approx. $35k at 6.410%, $36k at 7.210%, $37.5k at 6.840%, total approx. $109k) and 3 Direct Unsubsidized Stafford (approx. $24k at 5.410%, $23k at 6.210%, $23k at 5.840%, total approx. $69k). My monthly payment is set to be just over $2k/mo.

I was thinking about refinancing through SoFi (to consolidate all the loans into one) with the following options: 10 year with a 5% interest rate (paying about 1,900/mo) or 15 year with a 5.49% (paying about 1,500/mo). I'm not sure if there's a disadvantage in doing so, or if I lose any protections offered by my government loans. Should I refinance?

Any help/advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1480269575

personalfinance,"(UK) 24 years old, £50k pa job, £27k debt, not sure what to do going forward","Hi all, here's my current situation:

I graduated last summer with £27k of student loan debt. The interest rate on this is RPI+3% from my first year.

I graduated last year and started my graduate job right after. I now make £50k pa base. I live at home with my parents and have no other loans, so I have no significant expenses/liabilities.

I have around £46k in savings. £24k is sitting in a 123 Santander current account, which has served me well in the last year but not so much going forward since the rate is now halved to 1.5%. The other £22k is in a stocks &amp; investments ISA which has averaged about 10% since I opened it in February 2016. Half of funds are in S&amp;P500 and FTSE100 ETFs, while the rest are invested in 5 individual stocks. I want to move the £24k in my current account into an investment, considering rates have gone even lower and are unlikely to change soon.

My parents aren't well-off enough to significantly help me with my finances and they have no experience, knowledge or contacts to leverage for aiding my career or finances. Both my parents will retire in around 5-6 years with just £70k in savings. So if anything it seems like I will have to help them out financially. 

Right now I'm not sure what I should be doing in terms of investing, and if I should prioritise my student loan. My portfolio has performed well partly as I work in the investment industry, but I work 12 hours a day 5 days a week and I'm starting to become tired of managing my own portfolio and stock picking. Should I just stick it all in a fund and not worry about it even if I may make slightly more by stock picking?

I was also considering getting a mortgage and investing in property to rent out instead of investing in equities, but this is pretty risky with no experience and not a huge amount of savings as you'd probably need for real estate investment.


On the other hand, my student loan is beginning to worry me. Perhaps naively, I only found out about the high interest rate a couple of months ago but I think it was a little known fact given that student loans before 2012 were capped at below 1%. Slightly annoying that I joined university the very year the government, rather quietly, hiked the interest rate on new student loans (while at the same time hiking fees from £3k to £9k). 

With the rate at RPI+3%, and the depreciated sterling introducing a huge rise in inflation next year, my rate could soon become a whole lot higher. Should I just use my savings to pay it all off in one go sometime early next year, or start paying it off in slightly larger instalments over several years? My worry is that the interest is just going to pile on even more from next year onward. At the same time, I don't like the thought of depleting my hard-earned savings so quickly and feeling like I'm starting again from scratch.

I also want to buy my own house to live in eventually (preferably by the time I'm 30, although I appreciate this will be difficult). Obviously property investment and paying off my student loan will delay this further. I do have a credit card which I treat like a debit card in order to build up my credit rating. Ie always pay off on time at the end of the month and never buy anything I can't afford.

I've also tried to think of ways to make more money on the side (such as flipping on ebay), but with my 12-hour work days its hard to find time to make some decent side income.


Despite my job, I feel I need to aggressively save as I don't any financial support from family if anything goes wrong. Growing up without a lot of money has made me very frugal and reluctant with spending regardless of how much I make. I barely spent anything until I built up a decent cushion of savings and even now I can't bring myself to make big purchases. It's not long until I'll have to start financially supporting my parents as well. To add more stress, my older brother barely makes £20k a year, lives at home, supported by our parents and really doesn't seem like he'll be making any progress anytime soon. Particularly as my parents retire, I wouldn't be surprised if I'll have to start giving handouts to him. I'm on my own hereon out and will have to support my family in the not too distant future when I've just started my career - it's really stressing me out and worrying me, so I just really want to figure out a solid plan for my finances while it's still early.

My situation:

* My wife and I are very solidly in the 28% tax bracket, just a few thousand in income from the 33% bracket. (This means we can't deduct any student loan interest from our income.)
* I've got an emergency fund equal to 1.25 years of my wife and I's current expenses. 
* Current student loans are about $37k between 6.05 and 6.55% and $37k (yes, roughly the same amount as the higher interest loans) between 2.0 and 2.4%. I don't plan on paying the low interest loans in advance... 2.4% is hardly above inflation.
* Zero debt other than my student loans.
* I don't expect any shocks to our financial picture in the next year. No kids, no new debt, her job is secure (tenured teacher) and mine is fairly secure (been there ~ 9 years and am receiving good reviews and periodic promotions). I live near NYC and work in a in demand career, so there's very, very little chance of me being out of work for 6 months or more.
* If for some odd reason I happen to get laid off, I've accrued 4 months severance and could roll the 401k loan to my wifes 403b (through a 403b loan) in a worst case scenario move to avoid the loan being treated as a taxable distribution.

Before considering the 401k loan I had planed to pay the $37k off between now and June, but I got to thinking... why not take the guaranteed return of 6.25%. The only real risk I see here is market timing... that is there's a chance the market goes up greater than 6.25% over the next 6 months. 

Am I missing anything? Anything else I should be taking into consideration?

To outline my situation right now, I graduated with no debt, and my job is about 20 minutes from my house so I don't pay rent either. 

I know this all sounds great right now, but the issues here are:

1) My parents aren't very current with their mortgage and I help out whenever I can, I expect this to continue for a few years. This is about 4000 a month, but I contribute infrequently, sometimes 1K or sometimes 4K every few months.

2) My brother goes to college, and he doesn't have federal loans so we pay for his out of pocket. He's not a citizen so he never applied for loans as we couldn't get a co-signer. This is about 12K per semester, I usually contribute 1K - 2K per semester for this. He's still got 3 more years so this might go on for a bit too until he works. I graduated without debt thanks to my parents, and I want to be able to put my brother in a similar position. 

My expenses aren't much, although I expect them to be for the first year as I'll buy clothes, and various hobby items if possible. I probably pay 200 in lunch for work, 300 for various other expenses, and other than that nothing else. 

Now, I've worked an internship in designing and maintaining benefits programs so I know a decent amount about savings strategies about 401k's, IRA's, diversification, the whole nine yards.

To get some things out of the way -
I am planning on marrying her in the near future (say year to year and a half, just need to plan some things)
I know that general advice would be to not pay anything to her loans until officially married as things could go south, etc. - I am not concerned about this and am just looking for advice on the monetary aspect.

My main concern is how this will go over during tax season. What would be the repercussions of making this payment? I know there is a gift limit which I believe won't actually cost me anything extra in taxes, correct?

Are there any other hidden costs to making this payment that I could avoid by waiting until officially married?

I would be paying off private loans so no issues with federal loan programs/deferrals 
They average to about 6-7% interest rate so it would be good to knock these out before thinking about mortgage/other investments.

I plan to get 2 jobs. A night job at a hospital doing minimum wage work (or close) - which I expect will yield me about $600 a month. I plan to put this money directly into a savings account for two reasons.

1) I would like to purchase a new car at the end of 2017 and hope to find a good deal during a clearance events /black friday. I would like to buy a brand new civic coupe - I am considering going 4 door to save on insurance but this is one luxury I would like for myself.

I'm graduating from uni in May next year with a job that pays a total of 43.5k for the first year. Its in the Big4 of accounting, so the yearly increments are substantial.  

With reference to: https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employers/employerguides/employer-guides/paying-cpf-contributions/cpf-contribution-and-allocation-rates
A 37% contribution rate to a government-run retirement fund (CPF) that can be used to pay for public housing and medical expenditure is mandatory here. So effectively, I'll be taking home slightly less than 30k in the first year out of work. 

I've kept a budget using YNAB and have some amount of an emergency fund from the allowance my parents give me. Student loans are at 22k but they do not bear any interest (its a loan from a non-profit) and my parents want to pay for this 22k once they get access to some of their retirement funds in 2019 (its a partial payout, govt makes you buy an annuity with them using a substantial amount of one's fund that is not paid out. the annuity starts disbursing 10 years following this initial payout).  

I don't have any debt and about 7.6k in savings. Some of those savings would be used to finance graduation trips with friends, in total I expect it to cost 5.5k. 

My major expected expenditures in the future would be: 

A. Wedding/Marriage @ approx 15k in total cost, but definitely above 10k due to a dowry.

B. Housing @ slightly less than 500k in total, approx 50k downpayment + other costs. It can be paid via CPF as mentioned earlier. Optimally, you would pay this by cash since CPF has an interest rate floor of 4% p.a. for now.

Personally, I've been able to save an average of $80 a month from my $500 allowance. I really will try my hardest to avoid lifestyle inflation. 

With a take-home pay of approx $2400 a month, my plan for the next few years is the following:

1. Keep expenditures + nominal amounts to my parents to less than $700 a month.

2. Work towards an emergency fund containing 5 months of expenditures.

3. Work towards saving for purchases A and B.

personalfinance,Paying off additional principal on 30 year mortgage vs refinancing into 15 year (TX),"All,

I am in need of a bit of advice for my current situation. I appreciate your help with this because I am looking for a bit of perspective. My gut is telling me to refinance, but I am trying to see if I am missing something with my analysis. Here is my current mortgage situation:

**Current Mortgage:** 30 year, refinanced to 4.0% interest in January of 2015, owe $223k

**Current Home assessment:** $305k fair market value, condominium, Houston TX

What I am currently trying to figure out if whether or not refinancing into a 15 year mortgage makes sense. I have plans on buying a new residence in about 12-24 months, and I am trying to build up equity as quick as possible while preserving capital. When I original bought my condominium back in 2013, I had a game plan to sell it within 3-5 years based on construction and property assessment patterns in my area of town, and the strategy has paid off. Last year, I was intending on moving the unit during Q3-Q4 of this year, but Houston has been hit due to the oil glut, and property across most of the metro area has taken a sharp decline over the past nine months. To provide a bit of scale, I could of sold my unit for a conservative estimate of around $340k at the beginning of the year. 

As stated previously, I am looking for the best strategy to employ here given my current mortgage situation. Does it make more sense to refinance into a 15 year or just pay off huge chunks per month based on my current mortgage? The mortgage broker I have used in the past offers a re-finance where the closing costs are included into the interest rate, I.E I pay +.125% in lieu of paying closing cost. Assuming I can lock in a 15 year rate at around 3% for the balance of my current mortgage (so not a loan-to-value refi like I completed in January of 2015), I would be saving about $2200 a year in interest assuming I don't move within 24 months.

personalfinance,"24 years old, 11k in student loan debt, considering going back to school","Hi /r/personalfinance, I was hoping you could give me a little perspective on something.

I graduated from college in May, with 11k in debt and a degree in advertising and communications. I have to pay around $120 a month, but have been dropping around $200 in as I can afford it. I'm very lucky, as this is my only real bill that I'm responsible for.

I work in the marketing department of a non profit organization, and take home ~$850 every two weeks. 

I moved home after graduating so I am living rent free, though I do buy some groceries and cook for my dad and brother a lot. I probably spend around $200 on food for family meals.

I have a low limit credit card (through a credit union) that I use to put around $200 on monthly, and pay it off in full before it's due in an attempt to build my credit.

I am beginning to put a little less than half of each paycheck into savings, combined with savings for a trip I never took, so I have around $1.5k in savings, but it is growing.

I am moderately unhappy in my job. The money is fine for where I am in my life right now, and I love my coworkers, but I know that I can't move into the job I want in my current place of employment or really even the city I live in.

In order to transition to that, I want to attend a 12 month vocational school that will cost me around $18k, and that is not including living costs or higher rent in a larger city. (A one bedroom here would cost me around $500-700, there at least $900.) Hopefully I will attend in about a year.

If I attend the vocational school, I don't think that my (federal, subsidized) loans will go on hold. I'll keep having to pay them. Federal loans also don't apply to vocational schools, and so I'll have to find a private loan.

Should I continue saving my money, or pay off as much of my loan debt as fast as I can before I take on any new loans?

What is your advice to me to put myself in the best position to move to this bigger city and take classes while experiencing a loss of income?",finance,1480312904
personalfinance,"23, Discovered Collections Bill Previously Unaware of, Screwed Credit","I'm a college student. I went to apply for a personal loan recently and was rejected. Surprised, I checked my credit score, which had previously been unavailable, and discovered that my score was around 530. My payments are listed as being 100% on time.

The reason for this low score, it seems, is a massive medical bill for around $4500+ dollars. In 2011 I fainted and my boyfriend called an ambulance for me. I had insurance, but apparently did not indicate my insurance provider at the time. I received NO notification that my insurance info was needed: not by mail, phone, or otherwise. Fast-forward to now, the debt was sent to collections in 2013, has been racking up interest ever since, and has totally decimated my score. I cannot apply for the personal loan I need, nor the car loan I need, because my credit is so low that I have been entirely rejected in my application process. I am, otherwise, in great financial health: I have no other debts besides a few school loans which are federal only, and I have zero credit card debt whatsoever.

Is it too late to call the insurance company and see if they can do anything? Do I pay it off? How do I speak to the creditors, or the collections agency? 

Side note: my family is in no position to lend me anything to pay the debt, and I have no savings due to unexpected medical concerns which have prevented me from working in college. If anyone has advice, please let me know! Thank you.",finance,1480313297

one credit card is 6000 and the interest fees are kicking my ass. I tried calling the bank to see if they could help me out with lowering the fees. They said no. Understandably so. I got myself into this mess with my own decisions. I've just been paying on the interest.

I will be driving 25,000 business miles a year.

Old plan:  $800/month with company fuel card and could expense 100% of maintenance.

New plan: $623/month with $.19/mile reimbursed for business miles and maintenance.
Vehicle must not be older than 5 years or 150,000 miles.

2015 GMC Sierra 4x4 All Terrain.

Currently Owe $19k.
3 year loan through Penfed, $700/month note.

Naturally, I take the biggest depreciation hit in the first few years, so I would take a bath on trade which is making me question if this is the best plan forward.  I hit up several dealerships that have used Accords on the lot and I’ve been getting offers around $29-30.5k for my truck.  The depreciation hit is making me question if I should try and trade my vehicle in now verses waiting a year or two.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,[Auto] Sick of my car loan payment.,"Hello all.

I have been thinking about paying off my car loan for quite a while now. Bought the car in January of 2015. The loan started off as $26,212. Monthly minimum payment is $385, which I have been paying +$50 towards principal, for a total of $435 a month. 

Interest rate is 1.9%. Owed with Principal is 17,405. Payoff would be 17,425.


I make roughly about 50-60k a year with my job that I have been at for 2.5 years. I have $36,000 in savings currently. My bills are roughly $1,470 a month (rent, car insurance/loan, cellphone)

The only thing that is holding me back currently is the outlook of my employment. The field that I work in is in a tough bind. We currently have no jobs after this one currently finishes (mid December). I get paid salary  (22.5k) plus a field bonus for the work we do (that is where my 50-60k previously stated comes from).

personalfinance,"[USA] GF looking to pay off debts, not sure where to start","My GF and I are looking to buy a house together, but she wants to pay off some debts first. She's unsure of how to approach them. She currently has an annuity that she is supposed to receive until 2027. She receives monthly payments of $730 from the annuity. Her plan is to take approximately $29,000 as a lump sum from the annuity and apply it to part of the down payment of the house as well as pay off some other debts. This would essentially stop her from receiving monthly payments from the annuity until 2020.

The first debt is a student loan. She owes $2500ish on it and there's a 9.75% interest rate.

The second debt is a car payment. She owes $13000 on it and there's a 2.14% APR. Her car's value has depreciated rather quickly and the Kelly Blue Book value of her vehicle is approximately $8500. She really likes the car, so she intends on keeping it.

The approximate down payment she would like to place on the house is $21600.

What is her best course of action here? I believe she should definitely pay off her student loan debt first because of the high interest rate and the low remaining balance. I think also putting the down payment on the house is a good idea too. I am currently putting the same amount down myself as 10% of the cost of the house. Her matching my amount would bring us up to 20% and remove the cost of PMI from the house. She's very unsure of what to do with the car as she owes more than the vehicle is worth.

After speaking with several people in the banking industry as well as a couple of lawyers it was suggested that I file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 

Cost to file is around $1600.00, and it will resolve me of around 50k of debt between unsecured credit cards (all around 22% interest), a predatory loan (10k loan with 33% interest rate)  and a underwater car loan (cars worth $9500, I owe $18500) I would like to keep my car, I've read that you can file, and the purchase the car for its current value post bankruptcy.

Every where I look shows that it is a federal program ""set to begin in 2007"" and there is nothing really updated.

The payments will be 247.47 a month. I called the number for the program and the worker there related that it is a 10 year program in which the first year, I will pay $110 a month and the program will pay the rest. Next year, after I have my child and have a dependent, the payment will go down to $58 a month. After the 10 years, I will have paid $7625 of my loans, and the program will forgive the rest of my loans. 

Sounds amazing, but here is where it got kind of sketchy. The worker stated that I would have to pay $595 to actually get started in the program then wait 4 months to get it going.

The more I investigated it the more it seems like a Ponzi scheme. The owners have received millions in distributions on their equity that has been mostly funded by the sale of their subordinate notes. The founder and majority shareholder also gets a 20% dividend on preferred equity that only he owns. As well as a salary. Aspirity has been bleeding money and their latest 10-Q shows a significant equity deficit. 

I'm kind of convinced that this whole business is a scam that has no intent on paying back the loans just shuffling money to the owners and will allow the company to explode in the next couple of years. They recently upped the interest rates on the notes, which to me implies they are getting desperate. 

Does anyone have a take on this that it is not a scam? (By scam i mean little to no chance of getting the money back even if its not illegal) I'm really interested to see if my logic is completely flawed. 

If you agree its a scam is there anything that could be done about it? Should this be reported to SEC? Or you think any media company would be willing to cover it?  I feel bad that there are people like my friend who might not know better are buying into this.

I'm looking to take out a loan for improvements for an investment property that I own, and am looking for some advice on getting the best deal for the loan. I own the investment property free and clear, and it's valued at a bit over $40K.

My current debts are 1) roughly $9K personal loan 2) roughly 20K vehicle loan 3) one credit card that I don't carry a balance on, with about a $7K credit line. I have somewhere between $10-$15K cash available to apply to whatever, or not. I expect the improvement loan to be in the vicinity of $30K

My credit score was in the high 700's but recently dropped to the mid 700's after taking the vehicle loan.

I'm looking to obtain the improvement loan within 2-3 months, ideally, and expect it to be somewhere around 30K. That time frame can be pushed back if it might mean better terms for the improvement loan, or might buy time to prepare/set up for better terms.


Given the above, I'm wondering what the best approach to obtaining the improvement loan might be. I'm wondering if it makes sense to pay down or pay off the personal loan, which circumstantially has a relatively high interest rate, prior to applying for the improvement loan? I'm also wondering if it makes any sense at all to obtain an additional credit card (or two?) in order to increase my available credit, prior to applying for the loan.

investing,"To predict the stock market with some indicator X, we do not need a causal relation between X and stock returns.","I posted the original question in a [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/5f0eew/to_predict_the_stock_market_with_some_indicator_x/).

A few people came to the right conclusion that X does not need to be causal in order for it to be potentially useful in predicting returns.

A simple example shows why. Smoking causes cancer. It also causes people to huddle outside their buildings a few times during their work day. Does standing outside cause cancer? No.

But does the fact that we see someone standing outside her office building on a regular basis, change our prediction of whether she will get cancer? Yes. (For clarity you can assume that you can see them standing, but not what they are doing.)

This is no different from what all the machine learning people are doing in Silicon Valley. These engineers don't care (nor usually have a clue) about causation. They just want to make predictions. And for this purpose we don't need causation.

When would knowing a causal relationship help? It's necessary if we are making some sort of change in the situation and want to predict the outcome. For example what will happen to the economy if we change fiscal or monetary policy in some way? This is why macroeconomists are so focused on establishing causal relationships.

In our example, suppose we observed that standing outside is correlated with higher cancer. So we change our policy and allow people to smoke in designated smoking rooms inside the building. Would this decrease the incidence of lung cancer?

**TL,DR:** Don't blurt out ""correlation does not imply causation"" without thinking whether it applies. The statement is true, but may not mean what you think it does in the context of prediction.",finance,1480357336

personalfinance,Do I benefit more from re-financing under my name (making payments toward a loan with higher interest) or my father re-financing in his name (with me making payments towards the lower-interest loan)?,"I have been taking a closer look at my current student loan situation as I am getting spammed with re-financing offers from various banks. As background, I graduated college in 2014 and have been employed full-time since the day I graduated. I have never missed a student loan payment and currently have two ""loans"" in re-payment; a pool of Federal Un-subsidized loans at a weighted average interest rate of 6.06% (10YR Term) and a pool of private loans at 8.09% (15YR Term).


I am currently earning above average income for my field (corporate finance) living in Boston. I am 24. My fixed expenses are rent, utilities, a gym membership, and these loans ($610). I don't have a car payment and paid insurance up-front. I make a monthly credit-card payment to pay-down purchases and a revolving balance. My expenses aren't exactly the focus of this post, my lifestyle is what it is and I live comfortably while putting away approximately 20% of my net weekly income (getting paid weekly is pretty sweet!) into savings, on top of contributions to a 401k. I very rarely dip into my savings unless I feel it would be advantageous to do so (ie. I used savings to switch auto insurance providers and pay the policy up-front, saving myself $300 over the prior policy and in the process extending my coverage another 3 months). I am comfortable with my current spending habits and am slowly making adjustments to bring my discretionary expenses down without materially affecting my quality of life. 


Anyways, my question is really focused on the benefits of re-financing and taking a loan in my name (with my father as a co-signer) or my father taking a loan in his name (with me as the co-signer). My father owns a business and has excellent credit which allows him to get a significantly lower rate than I can get on my own. Now, I have not yet completed an application for a loan, so I am using pre-approved rates (subject to change) for my analysis. My father is pre-approved for a 7YR loan at 4.5% that would equate to a lifetime cost of $56.5K, with a monthly payment of $672.80. I am pre-approved for a 7YR loan at 6.49% that would equate to a lifetime cost of $62.8K, with a monthly payment of $748.29. These scenarios offer me a potential incremental savings over my current loans-in-repayment of $14.8K &amp; $8.5K, respectively.  I would be making the payments towards the loan regardless of the scenario I choose, and can reasonably afford the increase in the monthly payment. 


So, my question is, does it benefit me more in the long-run to take a loan in my name, make the payments towards the loan (I will likely be in a position to afford an more aggressive pay-down in the next few years) and reap the benefits of the recurring payments have on my borrowing history and creditworthiness? Or, do I allow my dad to borrow and take advantage of the lower interest, lower payment, and increased lifetime savings, while not benefiting from the payments being made in my name as the primary borrower? I want to make sure I am not weighing the monetary benefit too heavily in the short-term considering the earning potential and career trajectory my field offers me. At the same time, I do not know enough about credit history to make an educated guess as to how a monthly payment over that term materially affects my creditworthiness. 



**TLDR; Do Do I take advantage of monetary savings while paying a loan that I am only a co-signer on, or take a loan as a primary borrower where the savings in lifetime cost are approximately $6K less?**

I've talked with the person who is considered 'landlord' and she said pay half and to keep her in touch how I'm gonna find the other half (but then I have no money and they can still kick me out) . My 2 options I  think are to either withdraw a loan from those shitty places that aren't with the banks (I asked from my bank but they declined) and then look for a job and when I start one withdraw a loan from the bank to pay the 1st shitty loan with high interest rate, and then I think I'll manage after I've found a job .

I'm slightly perplexed in regards to my contribution percentages towards my 401k with a 4% company match.

I understand that income is taxed on a progressive tax system, but if I'm getting taxed now for roth contributions wouldn't it make sense to have all of it taxed at 15% after traditional contributions instead of having a portion of it at 25%?

I have 49K in Federal loans.

25K is Subsidized loan
24K is unsubsidized loan.
They are both at 5.75 interest. I am in school right now so they are deferred and I am not making payments but interest is accumulating on the unsubsidized loan.

I also had 96K in private loans but I got them to settle for 37K. This 37K is paid over 96 months so $385 a month. I also owe my lawyer 14K also paid over 96 months so $145 a month. 

I know the smartest thing towould be to put it all towards my federal loans since there is no interest on the private loan settelemt but as you can see it is over $500 a month in payments. I can make the payment but its tighter then I want it to be. Also, not that I expect it but if I lose my job the federal loans will work with me. My lawyer and the private loans wouldn't. 

Next year when I finish school I will have to pay my federal loans and I believe the payment will be around $400 a month regardless if I pay off the unsubsidized loan or not.

My thinking was to pay off the unsubsidized loan in full, and then use the remainder to pay off my lawyer leaving the $385 payment and the 25K in federal loans.

personalfinance,Help! We're running out of debt to pay off.,"Hi PF. My husband and I (we're 29 and 30) have spent the last 3 years paying down our debt, and it’s gone well thanks in part to this sub. In fact, it’s going so well that we’re nearing a crossroads and unsure where to go from here. We’re admittedly pretty overwhelmed by the info on the sidebar, but we have read it. That said….


The numbers:


Combined, we net about $90k. We are both maxing out our Roth IRAs. We have excellent credit (both hovering just at or under 800). We’ve paid off close to $90k in student loans, car loans and mortgages since March 2014. We put as much as we can each month toward paying down debt and as of December 13, we’ll finally be down to one loan – a mortgage of about $100k with an interest rate of 2.5%. Our minimum payment on that is $900 and some change. We do have one credit card that we pay off monthly and our emergency fund is in progress (currently at ~$4k with a goal of $10k). 

Aside from adding to our emergency fund each month, we put a small amount aside for both of our kids (a 3 year old and a baby) on a monthly basis. Nothing crazy – maybe $50 for each.

 

So all of that said – now that we’re down to a mortgage with very low interest, what do we do with the money we’re bringing in? All told, after bills and kids and life, we've still got over $3k in income each month to put toward *something*. We don’t know much about investing, but I'm sure the answer lies somewhere in that department. Where the hell do we start?

personalfinance,Housing. Question about financing options for our first house.,"Wife and I are buying our first home and it's time to choose which loan we want. Our lender sent us three options. 1) $34.5k down, 3.75% at $2,675/month. 2) $28k down, 4.0% at $2,736/month. 3) $22k down, 4.25% at $2,800/month. The house is 3 bed/2 bath with a detached MIL 3/1 that we plan in renting out. The MIL needs new paint but that is really it. We are going to do a lot of work to the main house flooring, both bathrooms, take down some walls and update the kitchen. Before we move in we need to paint everything, take down the walls, put in laminate flooring and update the kitchen. We do not have the money to put the most down and do a lot of the work we want so we would have to stay at our current place until we can fix everything. We stay at her parents house for free so we don't have to worry about rent. Also considering getting 24 month interest free credit card to Home Depot so we can do all the work now and pay latter. If you do the math it about 7-9 years of payments if we went with the higher interest loan before we paid back the money we would have spent if we went with one of the lower interest rates loan. So it seems to me if we refinance in the next 7-9 years we would be ok. The long term plan is to stay here for 2-5 years while we have kids and save money for a bigger house on more land. We can rent the MIL house out for about $1,800/month and when we move out we can rent the main house out for around $2,300/month. This is in the Seattle area. I make about $120k/year and she makes about $60k. 

Does my idea of not putting a lot of money down now seem reasonable? What are some things we might not be thinking about? If we plan to own the house for a long time as a rental property how concerned should I be with locking in a low interest rate?

Let me know if I can provide anymore information.

   I play a collectible card game called magic the gathering. The game is extremely expensive, and I'm a 17 year old student with very little expendable income.  Buying booster packs, (comes with 15 cards, and one guaranteed RARE card), is around $6 at my local Walmart. I live in Canada mind you. Recently I discovered that my local dollar store sells packs for $1.50, with 15 random cards from random sets. One of these being a GUARANTEED rare card. It says this directly on the packaging. 

   Now, one must keep in mind that the only real reason to buy booster packs is for said rare card. This being because they are always much better cards. I went into my local dollar store today and bought 12 booster packs, coming to just over $20 total with tax. Excited, once home I began to open them. On the second to last pack, I flipped through the cards and I didn't see a rare at first glance. I flipped through them once again, and sure enough, no rare. The 11 other packs delivered what was promised, but this one didn't. I'm curious if this would be considered false advertising, which I believe is a federal crime in Canada. It says directly on the package that there is a rare in every pack. 

   Once again, I will not do anything to attempt to battle the store, I'm just wondering if there could be an option to do so. 

Note- the cards are packaged by a company that isn't the dollar store. However, the dollar stores name is clearly on the packaging, next to the price. It is not a sticker, it is part of the packaging.

She passed away exactly one month after I received the loan. I graduated in spring 2009 with two degrees.

Anywho, after college I worked for two years ($10/hr) before going to grad school to get my Master's degree, starting in fall 2011 (literally had 1 cent in my bank account after applying). I took out a Grad Plus loan during my first year. The second year I paid tuition mostly through a small inheritance that my father left me (he passed during my first year of grad school), but that money dried up as soon as I was done with grad school in September 2013. I moved back home and did research for another year (making only $17/hr). I made payments to my loans before and after grad school as best as I could, but didn't make a dent whatsoever. I consolidated my government loans at one point, but I'm not sure when (I believe it was before grad school).
I started med school in July 2014, having to take out federal loans and more Grad Plus loans to survive. I had to briefly step away during my spring 2016 semester to address some family issues, and because of that am retaking my second year (although I'm academically fine).

Last week I started getting call from Navient. Apparently I have to start making payments on my Tuition Answer loan and I am already two months behind. They had been sending letters to my grandmother's old house, but not mine... which was kinda pointless as my address was updated in the system and my grandmother has been deceased for 8.5 years now. I told them I was in school, but apparently I had maxed out on monthly in-school deferments. I also only have one month left on forbearance (which I mistakenly liberally used right after college). This loan was originally $15,900... but it has had a 10% variable interest and the total balance is now  $29,919.66, almost double the original amount. My payments will have to be $291.06 monthly.

Here are all of my loans:

I have 2.5 years left of medical school, so even more loans will have to be taken out. My credit score is in the high 600's/low 700's. I have desperately applied for scholarships but to no avail (I'm hoping for my 4th year I will be granted a scholarship that will erase all of my medical school loans in return for 5 years of practicing rural medicine).
I don't think that I can make these additional payments in addition to my present living expenses (rent, phone, study materials, food, etc.). On top of all of this, I'm quite certain that my mother took out Parent Plus loans during my freshman year of college that she has never made payments on.

So yeah... I now am being told I have to make payments on one loan while living off of other loans. I'm looking to be around $450,000 (rough estimate) in debt upon graduating medical school in May 2019. I'm desperately fearful of what lies ahead. I'm in my early 30's and doubt that I will be able to have any financial security or be able to start a family within the next 20 years.

I have no idea what to do, both handling the current situation and the future situation. Please help.",finance,1480407130
personalfinance,"Early 30s, need investment advice for what to do next","My wife and I recently purchased our first home and are now trying to figure out what our asset allocation should look like. We're 31 and 33 respectively, so we've got a ways to go before retirment.

We don't have any particular goals right now. I might quit my well-paying job to try and move to contract work / consulting with a more flexible schedule. The only other goal we would eventually have is financial independence, though we currently live in southern california and I think we'd need to move to a cheaper area to accomplish that. Additionally, we're not super interested in restricting our current lifestyle anyway.

We have $115k in cash that we keep for regular expenses, emergencies, and random things we want to buy (vacations, new computer, etc.) in savings accounts. There's also $38k in 1-year CDs that are staggered. These were my original emergency funds from way back in the day. The idea was that a new CD would come up every 2 months, so if anything unexpected ever happened, I could just stop the renewal of the upcoming CD. I'm not sure this makes as much sense anymore since they're only earning a 1.1% APY vs. the 1% APY of my savings accounts. Before when I was renting, the CD would cover rent, groceries, etc., which is where my emergency funds were likely to be used. Now I think I need larger chunks (for house emergencies), so I'm thinking about getting rid of these and converting them to cash.

Between the two of us, we have $480k in 401ks. These are all distributed into index funds with low management costs. We both max out our 401k contributions every year. As far as I can tell, we are not eligible for a Roth IRA as we make more than the joint income level limits.

We finally have $95k invested that's an extension of our money that's our investments for purchases down the line / things before we retire and can use our 401k. $11k it is invested terribly in individual stocks (gotta be a sucker with some of our money), $75k is in index funds with low management fees. There's another $37k that we were about to invest in the same manner as the $75k, but I held off on investing it beacuse of this reddit post!!

We owe $628k on our house that was appraised at $810k when we purchased it last year. The interest rate is 2.875%, so it doesn't seem to make sense vs. just investing. We have no debts other than the house.

I'm concerned that we're over-invested in cash / savings right now. If I do move the CDs to savings, then we have 153k in cash, which I think is probably way too much for two people (with no kids nor plans of them - we just need an emergency fund and money for fun stuff like vacations). I'd like to invest more of this money as I'm worried about basically losing a significant amount of wealth over time due to inflation, but I'm not sure where to put it. We could pay down the house as that's at 2.875% (for now), but that's still well below the S&amp;P 500. We could invest more into the stock market, but with some paranoia about a potential crash due to high P/E stocks, I don't know how good I feel about putting all of our money into the stock market since that's where basically all of our 401ks are allocated and where all of our non-house, non-cash currently is invested. I think maybe I should look into bonds / t-bills / other things, but I don't know much about them, and what I have researched about them, their interest rate is moderate but not that favorable (more like 2-3% right now by comparison to 1%, but nowhere near the 8% of the stock market investments). If it's really in the 2-3% range, then it seems like we could potentially pay down our house instead, though I suppose that could also be seen as a difference in investments between the housing market and whatever the bonds / t-bills represent.

What do you all think about our current distribution and concerns? I'm mostly self-taught for personal finance, so I'm guessing at a lot of this stuff from advice from parents + reading things on the internet (like this subreddit!) but I worry about whether or not I've got things allocated in the ""best"" way possible.

Last but not least, if reddit isn't the best place to get this advice... where can I get to get professional advice where they won't try to sell me something? One of my banks has offered free consulting services, but my experience in the past is those people always try to sell you on high-management fee funds.

personalfinance,"My parents took out a loan in my name during college which I got forgiven (or deferred?) based on my employment as a ""civil servant"", but am I trapped in my job?","I'm hoping this is the correct place for my question. Here goes, When I was a freshman in college (I'm now 24), I qualified for some federal loans based on my parents income. However, I had a scholarship that covered full tuition and housing so all that I had to pay for was a meal plan the first year and my books, so I chose to work part time at various jobs to cover that. My first year my parents told me they wanted to use that loan money since it was only $2,500, low interest, and would help them make ends meet. At 18 I wasn't really concerned since they seemed confident that it wouldn't be a problem for them to pay back. Mistake. Fast forward several years to 2016, and I get a call from my mom asking me to look into loan forgiveness since they had gotten a letter in the mail saying I qualified. Long story short- they continued to take out loans every year it seems (unbeknownst to me- we only ever briefly discussed that my freshman year) and now I had 20k in debt. I only every saw a small portion of that (couple hundred) to help pay for a meal plan my freshman year. My parents had been making the payments every month- I never saw a statement- but now I have two younger sisters about to go to college, and it was putting a financial burden on my parents. I was able to get the loan restructured where the dep't of education covers my payments and after 10 years the loan is forgiven. All of that was based on my salary (24k/year) and bc I work at a University and qualify as a civil servant. But I don't like my job. I want to leave, but I'm not sure what happens if I do. Will I have to pick up the payments? Would a job change affect any of the payments already made? My parents say that they'll continue to pay if I want to leave my job, but I'm not comfortable with putting my financial standing completely in their hands now that I know this is going on. I tried to reach out to the fed loan people who set up the restructuring, but they never answered.  I worked really hard to graduate debt-free, and now I realize that's not the case.",finance,1480426582

personalfinance,Worth refinancing student loans due to potential credit hit if purchasing house soon?,"Over the past 2-3 years I have gotten my student loans down from 130k to 22k.  I have recently decided to hold off on paying them to save for a house to buy roughly a year from now.  My credit score is good ~800 but I do not have many accounts, and do not have a high age of accounts.  My age of accounts consists of my 4 student loans that are all  6-9 years old.  A 1 year old credit card in my name.  A 1 year old and a 4 year old credit card in my wife's name that I am Authorized user on.  And a 1 year old auto loan.  That's pretty much it.  
 
Since I have put my student loans on pause.  I was thinking about refinancing through SoFi.  My concern is that not only will I have a hard inquiry on my credit report from doing so, but I will end up closing 4 of my oldest credit accounts in doing so, dropping my average age of accounts significantly.  My student loans are at 6.55%.  Another thing to consider is that they are with mygreatlakes, which allows me to pay any extra (after the monthly autodraft) on my loans with a credit card, giving me 2% cashback in rewards.
 
I am having a tough time deciding what to do, as refinancing will likely hurt my credit, raising my mortgage interest rate.  But refinancing will probably save me some money as well, unless the rate difference isn't much more than 1.5% or so, as I can get 2% cashback when i do pay off my loans aggressively.

personalfinance,"Lady hit my parked car, causing $559 in damage. Question about the possible insurance check she'll send me.","So a lady ran into my parked car last week when she was pulling into her own spot. Luckily, my boss saw it and told me about it before she was able to get away. So I have all of her information, insurance, etc.

The damage she did was on the bumper, and the scratch was significant enough that they can't be buffed out and the bumper itself needs to be replaced costing $559. I personally would rather just have the cash considering the car is pretty old already, and I don't think the scratch will lower the value of my car by $559 when I eventually sell it, so I'd rather just take the cash.

I have not called her to tell her how much it is, but I'm thinking she'll want to go through insurance when she finds out the cost. My question is, if she DOES go through insurance, am I able to cash the check the insurance company sends me? Meaning, can I just go to the bank and deposit it into my savings, checking, etc? Or does that check HAVE to be used on repairing my car? If the check does need to be used on my car, would an alternative be to give her a lower number than the $559 in hopes that she'd rather give me the cash to fix it than go through insurance?

I hope I was clear enough in this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1480435190

personalfinance,"Recently came into a large amount of money, unsure how to pay off loans.","Hello all!
I am a 23 year old working full-time as a medical assistant. Right now I make $35,900/year. I don't pay rent and my monthly living expenses are not very high. Pretty much, I don't live paycheck to paycheck and have been pretty good with saving up money.

An old house that belonged to the family recently sold and my portion of the money that I received came out to $30,000. I went to an expensive private university in NYC during undergrad and have a bunch of both private and federal student loans. Obviously I would like to pay all of those off ASAP.

For the past couple of months since I've gotten the money, my dad has been sending me ~$800/month to cover (some) of the cost of the minimum payment on loans (I am usually able to pay off a little more than the minimum every month of all the loans but Sallie Mae and Navient are screwing me over with the interest rates).

Here is a summary of loans:
Sallie Mae- $22,035.69 @ 11.75% interest
Navient- $11,690.48 @ 8.875%
             $20,710.51 @ 9.125%
Wells Fargo- $3,334.44 @9%
Citizen's Bank- $15,020.85 @ 6.5%
Federal Loans-$29,061.45 @~3-6%

The Sallie Mae and Navient loans are my highest payments every month and obviously that 11.75% interest rate is awful so I think the best idea would be to pay that one off first and divvy out the money after that to the other loans.

Extra notes:
-For the federal loans, I'm currently on a pay as you earn repayment plan and I would like to avoid paying that one off for now because I may qualify for loan forgiveness later down the road.
-Because my dad has been sending me the money in increments the total amount of money that I have access to is now probably around $27,000
-This is the only debt I owe; no credit card payments, car payments, etc.
-I do plan on going back to school in the future (currently in the process of applying to nursing and PA schools. So more debt is possible, but I also have the ability to earn more yearly)

I moved back home with my parents who have said that they want me to focus on paying off my loans first before helping out with the other bills around the house so I basically have little to none living expenses. I just paid off my remaining credit card balance as well so the only debt I have are from the school loans listed below.

My grandfather passed away in June and my mother had taken out a life insurance policy on him. She has given my brother, sister and I $5,000 each to pay for our loans (so $15,000 total). My understanding from browsing this subreddit is that since she and my father are married she would not have to be worried about the gift tax since their total allotted would be $28,000. Is this correct?

The bulk of my loans (with current balance) are through Great Lakes listed below:  
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $3,507.75 | 3.150%  
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $4,576.22| 3.150%  
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $5,617.61| 3.610%  
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $2,001.45 | 4.040%  
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $5,519.29 | 4.410%  

Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $1,033.63 | 4.040%  
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2,168.84 | 4.410%  
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2,611.20 | 6.550%  
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2,471.89 | 6.550%  

In addition to the ones listed above I also have a Federal Perkins Loan with a payoff amount of $8,976.17 at 5.000%  

Now, some questions:  
1. My parents suggested that I consolidate my loans. Would this be a wise choice?  
2. Would it be better to pay off the higher interest loans first? I read about the snowball vs avalanche methods but I'd really like some thoughts on this.  
3. Each month after taxes and everything I'm bringing in about $2,200. As mentioned above I have no credit card debt and little expenses. Is it too crazy for me to allocate ~$1,000 a month to go towards my loans or am I being unrealistic? My goal is to pay off my loans within 5 year - the sooner, the better.",finance,1480437040
personalfinance,Deciding whether to refinance private and/or FAFSA student loans? How to assess risk on refi gov loans?,"I've read through a ton of threads regarding student debt but haven't come across a question quite like mine yet since most folks are worried about their private loans. I have about ~$31k in private student loans (all from the same lender) broken down as follows: 

1. $7,217.65 at 3.25%
2. $7,830.25 at 2.50%
3. $8,966.66 at 6.50%
4. $6,797.09 at 5.25%

Weighted interest rate is about 3.69%, which actually seems reasonable considering I can pay off each individually (meaning I can target the highest rate first). Based on a quick search on Credible, I have a lower fixed rate already than anything they can offer and I'm competitive with many of their variable rate options. I believe my rates are fixed. I don't have the loan terms, but the rates haven't changed in the 5 years I've been out of school. 

I also have an additional $32k in unsubsidized Stafford loans at 6.55% interest. This is obviously way worse than my private loans, but I've heard a lot of cautionary talk about refinancing government loans. 

My husband is an engineer with zero student debt and we have a combined income of about $150k annually. I'm also expecting a raise next year of an additional $5k. We are renting in a busy metro area and hope to buy a home within the next couple years, but haven't yet begun saving for the down payment. Also potentially relevant, we both have very good credit (~765-780). 

He's a gov employee and I have a very stable job, so I'm really struggling to determine what risks might come with refinancing the gov loans. Anyone have any info or advice on risk assessment and whether it makes sense to refinance either/both/none of my student loans? 

**TL;DR:** I have good interest rates for my private loans, but pay nearly double in interest for my FAFSA loans. What are the risks associated with refinancing gov loans? Is it worth it for me to refinance any/both/neither of my two types of student loans?",finance,1480437272

personalfinance,"401K confusion: 22 y/o, first job, top of 25% tax bracket - traditional or roth 401k? Thoughts on my investment allocations?","Hi all! I have read the wiki and FAQ, which has helped me decide how to invest within my 401k, however I need a bit of guidance on whether it is best to contribute to a traditional 401k or a roth 401k as I have both options available in my plan. I understand the difference between traditional and roth - how contributions to a roth 401k are taxed at my current rate and contributions to a traditional 401k are pre-tax and taxed upon retirement. 

I am currently contributing 5% to my tradition 401k and 2% to my roth 401k and my employer matches on contributions up to 6%. I am 19% invested in bonds, 57% invested in domestic stocks, and 24% invested in international stocks. Mostly in index funds and all have low expense ratios. I am at the top of the 25% federal tax bracket.

So my question - Do you have advice on how I should contribute to my traditional 401k and roth 401k given my tax bracket (25%)? From my understanding it is best to contribute to the traditional 401k if you believe your tax bracket at retirement will be lower than your current tax bracket. This might be a dumb question but won't your tax bracket at retirement always be lower than your current tax bracket because you won't be working? So, I should go all in w/ the traditional?

personalfinance,[Taxes] Am I being taxed correctly?,"I'm sorry if I don't give enough information in the original post, I'm not too great with taxes but hoping somebody could help clarify things for me:

- Gross salary: $72k/yr
- Withholdings: None. I'm married but I put 0 on my W-4.

Until September, I lived in DE and worked in DE. I recently moved to MD, and expected to start being taxed by MD. I filled out W-4 for MD and claimed 0 like I always do.

My first paycheck came (keep in mind I changed my address mid-cycle) and I was taxed the same as I always have been from DE ($132.53), but now $172.14 from MD as well. I expected DE to go down since I moved and I thought it was less if you _only_ worked there.

The breakdown is as follows:

- Taxable Gross: $2,725.26
- Federal tax: $497.04
- DE Withholding: $132.52
- MD Withholding: $172.14

**1. Am I being taxed too much? The MD state income tax seems to be 4.75%. If I tax my full paycheck at that percentage, I get $129.45 taken out.**

**2. Should DE have gone down, or does moving out of state not matter?**

The reason I'm so shocked is because a couple years ago my permanent address was in NY and I worked in DE (I didn't really live in NY, just had my permanent address there as I was in school). I made $65k and NY only took out $12 a paycheck. Now with $340 a month being taken out by MD, I'm trying to figure out if this is right.

Thanks for your help guys. Please let me know if you need more info.

Edit: Do you guys recommend not claiming 0 on your W-4?

personalfinance,"How do you pay off a credit card ""every month"" when you use it daily?","I recently got a Chase Freedom Unlimited card with a high interest rate.

But after two months of usage I'm having a hard time understanding how I can ""pay it off every month"" when I use it daily.

If I use this card every day, I'll always have a balance on it, no matter when I send in the monthly payment. For instance, let's say today I have a balance of $1000 due on Dec. 2. If I paid the $1000 today and then used my card between now and Dec. 2, come due date, I will still have a balance accrued.

personalfinance,Financing of engagement ring,"Ok so I am trying to determine my best option for buying an engagement ring for my girlfriend and I thought I could try tapping into the infinite wisdom that I have seen in this subreddit after lurking for some time. So here is the situation... The timeline agreed upon for engagement between me and my girlfriend is quickly approaching and like most men, I do not want to disappoint her. The ring has been picked out already and I know about how much the total cost will be but not exactly so let's just say it's $7,500. I do have some savings but definitively not enough to cover the total cost of the ring. The jeweler that I will be purchasing the ring through does not offer any financing options but they do offer 9 months same as cash.

I am currently almost debt free with about $1,000 in credit card debt and $27,000 in available credit but none of which are in any kind of introductory interest period so my lowest interest rate on my credit cards is 14%. I also have an auto loan in the amount of $7,500 that carries a very low monthly payment. The car securing the auto loan is roughly worth $30,000 so I have plenty of equity here. I have a good credit score but I am trying my hardest to avoid putting any of this purchase on a credit card.

Would a cash out refinance on my auto make sense to cash out some of the equity that I have tied up? If so, where would likely entertain the idea of this type of refinance? Would applying for a new credit card with an introductory 0% interest rate be a better option?

personalfinance,Student Loan Reporting,"Despite occasionally forays into credit card churning I've been able to maintain a high FICO score (ranging from 800-830) over the past few years.  I believe this is in part due to large number of credit accounts I have reporting, my relatively long average age of accounts and mix of credit accounts (credit cards and student loans).

I'm in a position to fully pay off my remaining student loans.  My question is this, is it worth it to pay my student loans down to a nominal amount (say sub $10 each) to keep the credit lines reporting?  The student loan accounts are each around 10 years old and have always been paid on time.  My interest rate is pretty low (sub 4% on each of my four loans) so if I do so would be paying a buck or two a year in interest tops.  I kind of like having those lines reporting as other than my student loans, my only accounts are credit cards.  

I'm leaning towards not fully paying off each loan as I would like to get more into the credit card churn game and seems like benefits of maxing my FICO and maxing my approval chances for any credit card would outweigh the nominal amount of interest I would be paying but curious if others have done something similar or disagree.",finance,1480441861

Unfortunately, he had just come off a two month ""break"" at his contract job, and our savings were meager at best, as this job came up for me when I was least expecting it. Now, thanks to the cost-of-living increase, we're really struggling to pay off the move, and are trying to find the right priorities for paying off our debts with what little money we have. Our finances are separate, at least when it comes to our bank accounts, and we split expenses that are shared (phone bill, internet, gas/electric) depending on whose paycheck came in and who has the most spare money to help cover it. I can speak to our shared expenses, but not necessarily what he has on his plate. As a note, he's about to get a moderate lump sum from his father's estate that he's hoping to use to pay off a personal loan we took out for the move, his credit card, and his car payment. He makes about the same amount I do ($36,000/year before taxes), but his paychecks vary widely depending on whether or not he works Sundays for time and a half.

My take home pay on a monthly basis is $1955. My bills are as follows:


Name | Cost | Interest Rate
----|----|-------------
Rent | $925 | 
Car insurance | $158 |

Internet | $50 | 
Car Loan | $288 | 3.69%

Credit Union CC | $30 (min) | 11.24%
Audible | $15 (every other month) | 
Gas/electricity | $30-35 | 

I have a bunch of outstanding debt, including being upside down on my car loan since the car is worth much less in MA than in WA. Here's what I owe:


Loan Name/Type | Outstanding Balance | Interest Rate
--------------|-------------------|-------------
Discover Card | $2,862.95 | 15.24%
Credit Union CC | $1,448.73 | 11.24%

Subsidized Fed Loan | $3,368.54 | 5.6%

The value of the Forester is now around $4,500 if I sold it to a dealer. I did look at quotes from my insurance (which is the lowest price I got when we moved to MA) to see which car would be better to keep on, which is the Forester, but the car is at 104,000, needs new tires, is due for the timing belt to be replaced, and has the check engine light on. My fiance's car will be paid off soon, but will still cost around $105/month if we keep insuring just it. It's RWD, which I know isn't a horrible option in Boston in the winter, but he's not comfortable dealing with his first snowy winter without some kind of extra help, like snow tires, or AWD/4WD. Plus, honestly, the Grand Cherokee (what his car is) is a BEAR to try and park. 

One thing we were discussing doing, once he pays off all his debt with the lump sum, was seeing about trading both cars in for one smaller car (we were looking at Subaru Crosstrek), preferably used, so we could have a single payment, a car that does everything we need, fits my fiance's very picky wants for a car (he's the one who drives for work), and would save money in the long run. 

We already make lunches in the crockpot, buy anything we use a lot in bulk (toilet paper, eggs, cereal, etc.), don't eat out, and I use public transit/walking to run most errands and to get to work. My fiance pays for basically all the groceries, so if I were to say what I pay, it's about $50/month. 

I had my finances pretty well under control, and was really good at budgeting while we were still in Seattle, but our rent doubled, and we were stupid enough to put most of the costs of moving onto credit cards. I want to tackle all this debt, and I know to prioritize the credit cards, but I'm really overwhelmed by trying to balance it all out. Especially because it's now happened twice where I've just gotten everything balanced out, and either a check deposits late and 3 bills go through so I get overdraft fees (at $29 a pop), or early on in Boston, each of our cars got towed thanks to street sweeping (thank God it's almost December and we can face snow instead.../sarcasm). 

I also have been contributing 3% towards retirement since my company offers a match. The best part of the match is at 5-6% (100% match), but we couldn't afford that much of my paycheck being taken away. I have about $5,000 in retirement, no savings, and about $20 in my checking account until I get paid on Friday.

In the midst of all this, my husband and I are beginning to look at homes. Our budget is modest -- $150,000 to $175,000. This is a bit on the low side in our region but certainly not unheard of. I think this is reasonable on a $82,000 household income, with $35,000 in savings. The goal is to make that 20 percent down payment, and my parents have said they would chip in a bit for a down payment (aka they want us to live closer to them). We do have some student loan debt, but at $30,000 between the two of us and low interest, it is manageable.

The rental market in our region is awful, and everything I've read indicates that it is far better to buy here if you plan on sticking around (we do). Our rent isn't bad, but it does get hiked up each year and we don't get a lot for what we pay (right now, $900).

In an ideal world, we'd save up for another year and continue to pay down loans until we had, at minimum, an additional $15,000 to add to our down payment. I optimistically assumed that interest rates would still be low at that time, and figured this would give us a little more flexibility as we search for the right home/school district.

In the UK, there are super low interest rates at the moment for mortgages (2-4%).  The area I'll be wanting to work has 2 bed homes available for £125k. Most people my age struggle to save up a deposit but fortunately have £20k saved up from previous internships which is enough.

My student loan will stand at £55,000 when I finish and current interest rate is 4.6% but this could rise to 7/8% after Brexit. The loan is 3% + inflation (RPI). The strange thing with these loans are they get wiped after 30 years if I've not paid it off. I took a gamble the other month and borrowed £10k interest free from my parents to pay off some loan bringing the total from £55k to £45k. It's a gamble incase I die or become incapable of work. It also risks not paying off the loan before the 30 year threshold and the £10k being wasted. However, if I earn enough to pay off the loan before 30 years, I will have saved thousands in interest payments.

investing,confused about the price of bonds determinant.,"(1) In investopedia it is summerized that
&gt;When price goes up, yield goes down, and vice versa.

I think i get this, as in the return will stay the same no matter the price difference .

&gt;When interest rates rise, the price of bonds in the market falls, and vice versa. 

Now I am confused by this part does this say the same thing.

(2) Is coupon then just your predeterment value of your yields because of the par value e.g. 

&gt; If you buy a bond with a 10% coupon at its $1,000 par value, the yield is 10% ($100/$1,000). Pretty simple stuff. But if the price goes down to $800, then the yield goes up to 12.5%. This happens because you are getting the same guaranteed $100 on an asset that is worth $800 ($100/$800). Conversely, if the bond goes up in price to $1,200, the yield shrinks to 8.33% ($100/$1,200).

(3) can someone explain what they mean by "" bringing them into line with newer bonds being issued with higher coupons"" and ""bringing them into line with newer bonds being issued with lower coupons.""

&gt;When interest rates rise, the prices of bonds in the market fall, thereby raising the yield of the older bonds and bringing them into line with newer bonds being issued with higher coupons. When interest rates fall, the prices of bonds in the market rise, thereby lowering the yield of the older bonds and bringing them into line with newer bonds being issued with lower coupons.

personalfinance,My credit card just offered to lower my interest rate to 0% for the next 6 months. Is there any reason to NOT do this?,"First and foremost: I pay my credit card balance in full every month, without fail. I will continue to do that for the foreseeable future.

Anyway, my credit card company emailed me today with:
""We want to thank you for your continued loyalty by offering you a promotional APR of 0.00% on eligible new purchases on your [card]. The promotional rate begins the day after you enroll and expires 6 billing cycles later. After the end of the promotional period, the APR for these purchases will be the standard Purchase APR on your Account, which varies with the Prime Rate.""

My question is if there is any reason to NOT take this offer. I do not imagine taking advantage of the lower rate at all (again: I pay my balance in full every month), though it seems better to have a lower rate if possible just in case there was ever an emergency in the next 6 months. But if it would affect my credit in any way, or if there is some negative I am not seeing here, it doesn't seem worth it since I will likely not be affected by the interest rate change.

personalfinance,"23F, $3400 in CC debt, have been making payments for a year and seems like I haven't made a dent. What am I doing wrong?","I graduated with my bachelors degree last December. My parents bankrolled my college tuition and my rent for two years while I had two internships and went to school. When I graduated my parents went through a nasty divorce and financial help froze. Moved back to my home town on credit cards and racked up $4000 cc debt in two months, $3000 on a cc that had a 23% APR and $1000 on a cc that had an intro 0% APR for a year. (Dumb I know, but I didnt see myself having another option)

Currently I am still in debt $3,300 on 4 different credit cards.

I make about $37,000 before taxes and between rent and other bills I cannot pay this debt off in full. For the past year, I have been making payments upwards to $300 dollars a month and it seems like I haven't made a dent whatsoever. The only charges made to these accounts after the initial 4k were for emergencies, totaling $550. 

I think what I'm basically dealing with is compounded interest from the CC I originally had 3k on with 23% APR? So I opened two separate credit cards that had 0% APR and did balance transfers. 

Here's a breakdown:
Amounts shown are debt/max for each card

* CC $1290/$3000 (APR 23%). 
* CC $770/$1000 (Intro APR 0% that expires next month, then 23% APR)
* CC $970/$1000 (Intro APR 0%, expires in 6 months, then 22% APR)
* CC $270/$500 (Intro APR 0% that expires in 6 months, then 23% APR) 

So finally, I'm at a loss for what exactly to do because it seems like I'm in the exact same place I was a year ago. 
Should I consolidate the debt from the cards with high APR to get a lower interest rate? 
Should I just ride it out and let hurt my credit score for a while and just pay the interest I'm at? 

To end, lets just say I learned my lesson with credit cards the hard way. Seriously considering burning these things after all this is paid off.

personalfinance,Loan refi bait and switch?,"I need some help I feel completely duped by Navy Federal Credit Union.

So I'm 27 and just starting a job where I'm making roughly $30,000 a year before incentives. I'd like to assume it will only be $30k though so I can plan correctly. Extra would just be a bonus. 

I have $9,000 in a private student loan at 7.5% and $65,000 in federal loans with various interest rates, would say average is probably 6-6.5%. 

My fiance is a teacher and makes about $40,000 currently though he's on a teacher salary so he does get raises regularly. He has no student debt or car payment or anything. He's also able and happy to pay our rent, utilities, and food and such. 

Anyway this will let me put basically all of my money (minus gas and stuff and a small amount so I can have some enjoyment) towards my debt. My thinking was that I should pay as much on that private loan at 7.5% to knock it off as quick as I can. But I'm unsure of what kind of payment plan I should get on with the federal loans. Would it be stupid to put it on an income based plan for a year or two while I pay off the private loan? 

Finding the best or at least a good approach to dealing with my debt is my main concern/question.

My secondary question is what should I do in regards to taxes. Should we file jointly or separately? My income this year will be about $9-10k and his is about $40,000.

I fucked up years ago and had a car repo'd and it dropped my score to sub 500 levels so between this, an ATV and a couple credit cards that I've been paying off it's slowly climbed up to almost 600 over the last couple years.

personalfinance,Soon-to-be first time homebuyer... Have some questions,"So in a completely unrelated chain of events, I was helping my gf go car shopping... One of the salesmen had mentioned that he agreed with our sentiment that a credit union would be better than going with a loan from the dealer... Not only that, but he recommended one in particular that he had shopped around to find to get a good mortgage (he said it was the best in the state he found).  He also said that he believed they required you to be a member for a year to take advantage of their mortgage rates---- this is something I had never even thought was a reality, but it really got me thinking...

I checked his Credit Union, which does have lower rates than what is advertised at my CU (I use Consumers CU which has very nice 3+% interest rates on checking accounts, so I assumed that if someone beats them in the mortgage department, they should be a good option).   Is this 1-year wait period a typical requirement for mortgages?  If so, I think I need to find the best CU immediately... My lease runs out this summer, and I would either buy a house at that point, or more likely the following summer.  

Something else I am puzzled by---
For a 15-yr fixed loan (which I envision myself getting) his recommended CU has a rate of 2.875% and an APR of 3.158%.  Another good one I just stumbled upon has advertised a 15-year fixed rate of 3.00% and an APR of 3.065%.  I am no expert in APRs, but I am very number oriented, and I can't figure out how this can logically follow (I would expect one to be lower in both, not half and half?).

If this 1 year waiting period is a requirement, how can I research good CUs?  Google is just directing me to lists advertising poor rates compared to what I just mentioned.

I live in CT, and am currently renting with my gf, but there is a very good chance we are married (or at the very least engaged) by the time we buy a house.. Are there any positive financial implications (besides from a personal risk perspective) of being married when purchasing a house?  Also, I've heard that there are low-down low-rate options for first time homebuyers, though it seems each one requires different qualifications..  Are any of these worth consideration?  The two of us make well over 100k combined, so I can't imagine qualifying for any low income options (my initial thought was more down is always the best idea, but I've been contradicted that if we can get a low rate with little down, that is the smarter way to go)

I know I got a lot of stuff in here, but I'd appreciate comments on anything.. It's at least half a year away (and more likely 18 months), so I certainly have a lot more research to do, but I want to make sure there isn't something I should really be doing now (like I said, the 1-year waiting period comment scared me a bit)",finance,1480481381

- Back in 2014, when I was still in high school, I enrolled in a college level class at my high school that offer credit for both high school and college. For this reason, a XYZ bank account was created under my name, even though I still don't know why they needed to create a bank account under my name.

- NONE of my friends got their Federal Student Aid through the bank account first. Normally, they would receive a green package through mail, and in that package it has all the information on the options how to receive the money, e.g, through check, through personal bank account transfer, or through XYZ bank account. I thought I would receive my bank account information in that package. I didn't receive any package, and I had to call XYZ bank to ask about my bank account

- When I called bank XYZ, I found out that the bank account was created using my information. After many phone calls and emails, I finally got access to my account by providing my information. I thought that was it, but unfortunately it wasn't. I login to my XYZ bank account online just to found out that the initial refund preference was electronic deposit to another account and my Federal Student Aid has already been transferred to the initial refund preference bank account.

- I called bank XYZ again, asked about the bank account that they transferred my student aid money to, they said that I am not allowed to know about that account, and there is no way to reverse the deposit. 
- I contacted my business department at my college for help, they told me to go to my high school which I attended to ask. I did, and the answer was that they do not do any financial anything with my college.

Bitcoin,Real world economics of Bitcoin,"According to BitPay, their Bitcoin merchants are receiving about 400 000 transactions per year. If we assume that BitPay serves 60% of all Bitcoin merchants as it claims, then there are ~670 000 merchant transactions per year total. 

According to blockchain.info, the value of an average transaction is currently about $768. 

If we assume that Bitcoin merchants are receiving transactions of the average value, then it's about $500 mln per year total.

It's unlikely that the average merchant transaction is ~$768. It's probably much smaller (more than 50% of all merchants are IT services, marketplaces and gift cards services). Thus, the $500 mln estimate is the upper bound.  

I think the average merchant transaction is almost certainly bigger than $7. If it's true, then the lower bound is $5 mln.

So, it's **$5 mln - $500 mln per year** of buying real goods and services with Bitcoin.

gaming,problems I've noticed with Skyrim I hope they fix in TES 6,"(this is not Me complaining this is a objective look at issues and annoyances I see between the latest game in the series and the ones before it) 

lack of armor and weapon choice/customization: ok Morrowind a game form 2002-2003 had Medium armor armor a good balance of light and heavy armor benefits light armor was faster and heavy armor was more useful as far as protection. There where 18 armor slots on Your character You had helmets, chest pieces, left shoulder, right shoulder, right arm,left arm. right leg , left leg, boots, necklaces like 4 ring slots, belts which where optional &amp; You could where a robe over most of all the combos of armor an cloths.  Not even mentioning the weapons there where 19 different styles of weapon in morrowind throwing knives, throwing stars,throwing darts,throwing spears and possibly axes,bows, crossbows, long and short swords, war axes, maces, clubs, battleaxes, daggers, crescent blades, tontos, die'kitanas war hammers and more. also I wouldn't mind seeing something like being able to decorate weapons and armor with things like gems &amp; jewels and gold, silver, moon stone, dwemer metal etc. being able to crush up certain things to dye armor, cloths, weapons certain colors on certain parts        

Lastly different weapon styles:blacksmithing and what they had in ESO was interesting and it made each Race a little more unique. if You make a Imperial and You try an smith a iron dagger You can make a Cyirodilic style iron dagger. while a Redguard would be able to smith a Red guard styled iron dagger that would be the exact same damage (unless tempered or enchanted) would be more or less the same weight.

some people might pay more for exotic styled weapons like if Your in Skyrim and You have a Khajiite long sword some might pay the same as a nordic style sword for it others more knowledgeable (people from those other lands, former adventures, former soldiers, researchers and collectors) or more savie traders would possibly pay more. 

Also being able to do a quest or a series of quests for certain smiths that either come form other lands or are just well traveled an though You could learn a new style of smithing like if Your a Imperial  and You helped a Argonian smith they may teach You the Argonian style of smithing to go along with the cyrodilic style a imperial would already know.

Towns: they felt dead and they really stretch the definition of a ""Town"" or ""City"" in skyrim Windhelm, Solitude ,Whiterun, Markarth &amp; Riften are the only real Cities in skyrim they have stone walls, watchtowers and are the proper construction and size to be a city of some description. Dawnstar is a port village everything is only there cause the ships stop there. Falkreath is a village and honestly I don't know what keeps the place populated and the Jarel in wealth or the guards well staffed an armed aside form a small lumber mill they have nothing same going for Morthal. Winterhold used to be a town now its really only just the collage.   Also theres only ever like 5 people outside at a time during the day not counting the infinite amount of guards and over all theres only 35 people in like Solitude ya know the ""capital of Skyrim""  as for in Morrowind or Oblvion there'd be at least around a 100+ NPCs in the capital cities and they both came out in 2003 and 2007  Skyrim came out in 2010-2012.....  

Leveled loot/one Dimensional villains-Leveled loot: it needs to be gotten rid off it ruins what little realism a fantasy game needs. like if Your level 10 and You find a level 30 enemy an You fight and they end up falling from on high and dying an You can reach them then level 30 armor, shields ,weapons, staffs etc. should be Your reward for being able to out battle an out wit a though opponent but with leveled loot the ebony sword they had will go from doing 38 damage to 15 the second Your level 10 character touches it  which logically makes no damn sense even in a fantasy setting. Now some will say higher end gear that early gives You a god complex but I argue its not logical and it makes that encounter an weapon more special and memorable and that leveled shit applys to deadric artifacts and artifacts of the nine which is just stupid!  there weapons, armor and gear forged by gods they are supposed to be vary powerful.

one dimensional villains: ok finally the last bit flat as hell villains like ok not every villain needs to be interesting but the main ones need to be like the Thalmor. You know they are supremacist High Elves and act like secret police and dark age inquisitors. but You can't side with them You don't learn anything about them You don't get to see there side of it why they do what they do. hell and they are just a army faction. in Oblivion You could Join the cult that was worshiping the god trying to destroy the freaking world. like Bethesda even said ""We don't like the mad cackling villains we like ours more gray. the ones that show You there side of the story that try to convince You they are right or tempt You with immortality, god like power, unlimited wealth money, women , men and some that may try to seduce You into there service thats a good villain not just ""We're the bad guy cause Your different""",technology,1480494022

personalfinance,"F.I.N.A.L.L.Y getting my shit together. This sub has been a great help. 40k a year for income, about 10,000 in debt between medical bills and small beans on credit cards. Credit score of 550, looking to make drastic and big changes.","I met with my bank today,  and applied for a credit card (to start getting some good stuff on my credit score).  I have an appointment tomorrow with a mortgage company that some friends recommended that 'don't' give credit counseling but they explained in their office today as we chatted that they will very gladly help me figure out what to start paying off, which things to attack first, and what my game plan should be. 

I'm looking to get a high enough credit score to get a decent loan for a house without a crazy interest rate or having to do mortgage insurance.   

For reference, I would be buying a place for between 70 and 120 thousand, which in my area can buy you a decent small home (Or a kinda shitty big house) with some land.  Job is steady, it's time to take care of this whole mess. 

I basically just ignored the whole 'medical bills' and two credit cards after some things in my life fell apart (NOT an excuse, I fucked up and am responsible for my actions or rather, inactions) and after I ruined my credit, figured ""I'll just pay cash for everything"".  This worked for the last 6 years, but now it's time to fix my credit.  

Some things are poised to fall off my credit report, others would need to be paid for to have them removed (Do I understand it correctly that I would want a guarantee from the collections agency that the debt is wiped clean upon payment, not showing up at all afterwards?)  

I was VERY encouraged by things I saw on this sub over the last few years, that made me realize that maybe this was fixable. Maybe it wasn't too far gone.  And now that I have good steady employment, it looks like it's time for me to rebuild my credit. 

ANY tips would be welcome, any guiding advice.  Hell, just talking about it is encouraging and helps keep me on track.

personalfinance,"Student loans, IRA, Living Abroad and finally saving money","I'm 29 and living in China. I finally have a bit of financial stability and want feedback on my plan. Here’s my current situation…

 - I have $6500 in the bank (a bit more than 6 months living expenses). 
 - I can save between $1000 and $1500 per month.
 - I have $26,430 in student loans @ the following interest rates
    --$2,437 @ 6.8%
    --$14,510 @ 6.55%
    --$4,663 @ 5.75%
    --$2,340 @ 4.25%
    --$2,481 @ 3.15%

 - I was broke and on income based repayment for the last year so only paid $100/mo on the 6.8% loan and nothing on the rest.
- Starting next month I’ll be off income based repayment and the minimum will be $235/mo +$70ish/mo for the 6.8% loan. 

I have nothing saved for retirement but have started considering opening a Roth IRA. I read that I would have until mid-April to contribute to an IRA and have it count for 2016. I’d be able to max it out before then if I contributed $1375 each month, which I think is doable if I min pay my student loans. Then, for 2017 I could pay the $5500 max and pay another $10k or so towards student loans. Is that a smart way to do things? Or would I be better off ignoring the IRA or putting less in right now and pile the money to the higher interest student loans? I also haven’t lived in the US for many years and don’t really expect to live there in the future. How would living abroad affect things?",finance,1480501281

Forex,Thought I'd list a few macro risks that I've been looking at recently for some discussion points.,"TEDrate went above VIX for 3 months consecutively. Last time it did this was 2006… During August – December.

Last time initial jobless claims were this low in the US (43 years ago) the economy went into recession straight after.

Equity risk premium compression means stock markets are so highly levered based on minimal reasons. 127% of SP500 rallies during 2002-2008 were due to earnings. 92% of Rallies during 09-15 were due to ERP compression (yield seeking behaviour due to low interest rates (risk free rate)).

The BoE has quietly asked its U.K. banks to check its exposure to Deutsche Bank at the end of October.

Italy’s non performing loans continue to rise. Monte dei Paschi’s stock price continues to fall.

Banks are doing a load of accounting off book called ‘customer accommodations’ (Wells Fargo for example said they didn’t own any specific derivatives, but they do and call them customer accommodations which don’t have to be accounted for in a specific way on their balance sheet… To the tune of $1.2tn).

LIBOR is steadily rising still, the same as it did just before 08. Cost of hedging currency risk is becoming more and more expensive (ccy swaps etc). Could lead to thinner margins on buying US assets &amp; therefore reduce demand of USD.

A proposed rate hike could deleverage the US economy with a reintroduction of a risk free rate.

Further unrest in the Middle East.

LATAM issues could easily spread through region further.

China’s credit bubble – shadowy investments, huge household debt, asset bubbles forming in equities, iron ore. Depreciating Yuan. PBoC have been dumping 2-3 yards of USD per day on their FX swap lines. They hold USD reserves in US treasuries and they have been heavily dumping these reserves to support the Yuan. Also dumping US equities to finance other spending behaviours.

What are your thoughts on any of these?

financialindependence,"Mortgages vs cash, also taxes, fun stuff in here","It appears to be a commonly held belief that paying off a mortgage or buying a personal residence with cash is not a great financial move, but is more important for mental satisfaction and reducing anxiety.  

I have a hypothesis that this isn’t necessarily true and the reason is personal income tax.  A mortgage is approximately 4% today, and with the primary residence interest deduction it's roughly 3% actual cost.  That's a super low rate for access to a large sum of money.  I can understand why some would say to pay the minimum and invest the rest because if it makes more than 3% annually you're doing better than paying it off.  This is how I’ve done the mental math in the past.

But what about personal income taxes?  A $1,000,000 mortgage at 4% is about $4700/mo, or $56,400 per year in mortgage payments.  For easy calculation I'm going to estimate 3k/mo is interest, the rest is principle.  This means I'd have to make an extra 20k in principle payments that are not tax deductible.  If I spend 80k/year for my family (married, 1 child) without mortgage, my federal tax burden would be about 7k (standard deduction, child credit).  

Adding in the 20k needed to support my principle payments and an additional 36k for interest payments (adjusting the standard deduction to itemized, $36000) I'd be paying $14, 518 in federal income tax.  The child tax credit of 1k is phased out starting at 110k for married filers so that’s part of it.  But $7500 in extra taxes each year because I need the extra income to cover the loan payments.

Since we’re all focused on FI, I think capital allocation is extremely important and this type of analysis can help with decisions of where to focus our money to achieve the FI goal.

TLDR; a short hand way of looking at this is to consider the mortgage rate without the interest deduction when planning for investments.  $7500 is 0.75% of the hypothetical million dollar mortgage so it’s roughly negating the benefits of the tax deduction on mortgage interest.  The next time I’m making a mortgage decision I’ll think, paying this loan off (or not taking it) is a guaranteed 4% return, do I feel comfortable getting that from another investment?",finance,1480529861
personalfinance,Are we getting boned on this 80/10/10 mortgage loan?

We gave them our salary, they pulled our credit scores ($185,000/year and 803 &amp; 717), and talked about a max price of $580,000 with 10% down. $550k is our sweet spot, but we wanted to know what our ceiling is. We got a prequalification PrimeLending this morning and they offered the following for a $580k house in Riverside county in CA, and we were hoping to get educated before talking to them tonight:  
  
  
**Combo loan**: 30 year fixed is 4.50% with 0 points. HELOC rate is prime interest rate of 3.5% plus a margin of 1.99% of 5.49% (what does this mean?)  
First loan amount: $417,000  
HELOC 2nd: $105,000  
P&amp;I payment on 1st loan: $2,112

Estimated taxes: $604  
Estimated insurance: $145  
Total payment: $3,341  
Total move in: $69,121 (incl. down payment and all closing costs)  
  
  
**Jumbo 10% down**: 30 year fixed is at 6.0% with 0 point and NO PMI (how is this possible? I thought PMI is always included when down payment is &lt; 20%)

My main concern is why are the interest rates so high? Is this typical for jumbo loans? We don't mind the PMI on the jumbo, but we don't know how there can be no PMI when it's less than 10%? Are they making up for lack of PMI with higher interest rates? What is ""3.5% plus a margin of 1.99%""?",finance,1480530344

personalfinance,First-time home buyer. Should I ditch my realtor?,"Edit: Yes, I know--this is really long. Apologies, folks. :-\

It would seem that the realtor with whom I've been working for the past 1.5 years has underserved me. I've had a sense of this all along but haven't quite been able to put my finger on it until recently. Maybe /r/personalfinance can help either validate or invalidate my suspicions and provide some direction as to how I might proceed.

I've been looking at houses in a fairly expensive side of town and have been seeking some means by which to determine a reasonable offer for a given property. According to my realtor, the listing prices of the properties is all but invariably what they are worth and that I shouldn't submit an offer for less unless I want to offend the seller. Intuitively, I have known that a good many of the properties are grossly overpriced, because properties that are reasonably priced sell quickly in this area. Properties that are overpriced sit on the market for months until they eventually sell for (often significantly) less than the listing price.

A week ago, I submitted an offer on a house which, in retrospect, was (and still is) overpriced by over $100,000. I had the realtor submit an offer on my behalf for $35,000 off the listing price (and still well above a reasonable value for the property), and that offer was accepted. I stayed up practically all of that night, trying to determine whether my offer was at all reasonable. I trolled around the Internet and learned about comparative market analysis, which is a good heuristic for determining the value of a property. I managed to acquire data from Zillow about recent sales of comparable if not superior properties that had sold in the area and formed the crystal-clear conclusion that, even after the price reduction on the property, I was still about to be overpaying by some $65,000 to $80,000.

I was furious. I rescinded my offer and had a chat with the realtor, inquiring as to why he had not offered comparative market analysis as a tool by which we could determine a reasonable offer for a given property rather than taking wild stabs in the dark and speculating about offers--especially with those speculations about 85% of the time being inaccurate and horribly against my favor.

He didn't really have a great answer. He fed me some line about how he performs an analysis himself prior to our viewing any property and goes into the viewing with a good sense of the worth of the property. In response, I drew upon some of the data I've acquired regarding properties we'd seen for which he'd provided wildly inaccurate estimates (again, insisting that houses that were massively overpriced were reasonably price at or near their listing price).

It seems apparent that he has not been paying due diligence to helping me get the best deals on properties. I ask for him to provide me a list of all properties that have sold within the neighborhood in which I've primarily been searching. This inquiry yields a list of some 50 homes that have sold within the last 18 months. (I realize that the last six months are most relevant to banks and realtors, but there was not a substantial difference between these time frames.) Sure enough, properties in the area have been horribly overpriced. They are list at $X and, over the course of months, are gradually reduced to $X - $25,000 up to $X - $125,000, depending on how inaccurately priced they were to begin with. The house on which I submitted an offer falls on the latter end of this spectrum. As mentioned earlier, according to the data I've evaluated along with having walked through several of the properties myself during open houses, the house for which I've submitted an offer would more accurately be priced at $X - $115,000 or so. The realtor says we have to watch the property, which I get--sometimes, getting a seller to arrive at the conclusion that their property is overpriced can be an attritive affair. Still, you'd think there'd be measures one could take to expedite the process.

Now, I'm thinking. I decide to anonymously contact the seller's agent in the hope of getting a better sense as to what would constitute a reasonable offer (for the seller). It goes without say that the seller's agent is a brick wall in this regard, which is fine. I explain my situation--again, without revealing my identity or that I've already submitted an offer on the property--and, without my mentioning it, the seller's agent, who is a ""super agent"" explains that the first thing my realtor should have done is to perform the comparative market analysis and to aide me in getting the property at the lowest price possible. I'd been thinking about presenting an offer as though I were a lawyer working to convince a jury or an entrepreneur presenting a new product to an investor, when suddenly, the next word out of the seller's agent mouth were, ""Sure, you may think the property is overpriced, but it's your agent's job to make a case on your behalf that it is overpriced--and, yes, that would likely involve a comparative market analysis.""

TL;DR - All right. So, that was a drawn-out explanation all for me to ask the following--should I just ditch my agent and resubmit my offer with a different agent, given that I have historically been underserved and that he obviously does not care that I get a good deal on a property?",finance,1480533242

Also, I am 28 year old single parent. My daughter and I live with my parents, so I don't pay rent.

Some questions I have are:

- What's the smartest way for me to go about tackling my debt?
- Should I consider consolidating my loans?
- What's the difference between the traditional TSP and the Roth TSP?
- How much should I set aside from my paycheck for the traditional TSP and Roth TSP? Should I even worry about retirement right now or should I just focus on my debt?
- Does anyone know anything about FEGLI? I've never had life insurance. They offer 3 options. I don't want to pay for something unnecessary.

personalfinance,VWI TDI Settlement Situation,"I own a VW Jetta TDI, and I have the option to either take a buyback or a payout for getting the car fixed. I owe ~$11500 on the car and the buyback would be for ~$14500. I could also get a payout of ~$5000 for getting it fixed. The interest rate on the loan is 6.79%. So, if I was to take the $5000, I would still owe the money on the car with a pretty bad interest rate. However, I also don't have a large emergency fund built up, so that $5000 could go towards that. If I take the buyback option, I can use the $3000 difference as a down payment on a car, to get a car with a smaller payment with a lower interest rate, and use that extra money to build up an emergency fund over time.",finance,1480535061
personalfinance,Long term capital gains,"I am 23 years old and I am lucky enough to be set up well financially but I want to do my part in educating myself on personal finance to make good decisions. 

When I graduate in May, I will be making around $110,000/year. My current income is about $15,000/year as a full time student. I currently live in NJ, where taxation is based on a tax table and to my understanding, long term capital gains are included the same as other income. I plan to move to Texas upon graduation, where there is no state income tax but I will still be subject to federal income tax. 

My question is, in investments I have done well/made money in the long term, would it be best to sell them now while I am below the federal tax bracket on long term gains? 

One example, I bought into a certain stock for $20 and have made about $5000 in long term gains on the investment in total. Would selling it now then buying it back make sense to avoid long term capital gains taxes later? Or will the advantage be lost in paying my state income tax now?",finance,1480535366

worldpolitics,Why I am with Standing Rock (wall of text),"This is going to be a rant/ essay going through several topics and explaining each of them as I am aware and why they contribute to my disdain of the DAPL and why it should be stopped immediately. I welcome dissent, so please share your thoughts in the comments. It is going to be a long post, so I really encourage you to read all of what I have to say before responding to bits and pieces.
Premise
In order to properly address this situation, it is natural to ask ""who is right?"", ""who is acting in accordance with law?"", ""who owns the land?"". I see a lot of people who seem to be set very strongly on one side or the other. The plain truth is, there is not a simple answer. There is about 150 or so years of complicated nuance behind this.
Time for a history lesson. The legal ownership of this land dates back to the 1851 treaty of Fort Laramie between the federal government and Sioux Nation. This treaty designated a huge region of land spanding several modern day states as one big reservation. Several years later, this treaty was altered. It was seen unrealistic to have one big reservation so many smaller reservations were made and the rest of the land under the treaty was designated as ""unseeded"" Sioux territory. This meant that the Sioux owned the land, the settlers were allowed to use the land for travel out west etc. but neither party was to build on the land (""seed"" it) without an agreement between both parties.
Well, as we all know, in the late 1800s homesteaders started making their way to the prairie. These people were mostly new immigrants and knew very little about the current laws in place. As a result, over the next several decades settlers continued to violate the treaty more and more. Instead of upholding the treaty, congress simply continued to just not care, even passing laws in clear violation of the treaty claiming unseeded territory without buying it from Sioux nation.
In 1944, congress finally saw the error of their ways and failure to enforce the treaty and offered to compensate Sioux Nation for all the land they illegally took over the years, but to this day, Sioux Nation has refused.
To this day, the protest site remains unseeded sioux territory under our treaties.
DAPL thinks they own the land, but really the land that they bought was taken from the Sioux illegally in the first place, WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGED IN 1944.
==Oil==
So before I write this section, I want to just say that I am an engineer. I am not trying to play any sort of superiority card, and anybody is entitled to their opinion, but I am just establishing that I am a member of the STEM community and do know a thing or two about this.
With that being said. Oil is BAD. People don't realize that because the sheer amount of money in the industry works really hard to keep public opinion, media, and politicians in dangerous denial. But the truth is that the STEM community is very very clear that our climate is in a state of emergency. Long term climate models are not funded by lobbyists. They are powered by scientific knowledge, pattern recognition, and algorithms, and right now, what they tell us is if we do not make a very swift change to renewable energy with the next few decades, the effects will be devastating and possibly irreversible. This is not a question of whether it will get a little warmer here and there. Millions of people WILL die. This is coming from someone who is in the STEM community, has read the literature, has worked with climate scientists... I am warning you. People are going to die.
When faced with such a crisis, do you know what we don't need? MORE OIL! America is a drug addict, and our drug of choice is oil. Making DAPL is like giving America and brand-new crack pipe. It's not helping us in the long run, it's very much fueling our destruction.
Now, I understand the economic need to be energy independent. I understand that getting rid of oil will have short-term negative economic effect. But the thing is, this pipeline isn't contributing towards energy independence AT ALL. In fact, large majority of this oil is being sent to filthy refineries down south right before being shipped to... China. That's right, not only are we violating law and the rights of our people and cutting up our land and polluting our air. We are doing it all so that a private corporation can profit off of China. All the while we are using law enforcement (who are supposed to be used for public safety) to defend this corporation. Are you kidding me?
If you are so concerned with energy independence, as an engineer I can tell you that the answer is green energy. We have so many resources for green energy in the country which we haven't tapped even close as we should. The technology is there, the engineering is there, we could have it RIGHT NOW. However, most of you probably think that green energy is not a viable solution for all of our energy. In the words of your beloved Trump: ""WRONG"".
The only thing keeping green energy back is corporate greed keeping all the money in the established industry of oil and all the money out of green solution.
Now that's climate change. Now what about something more tangible. Something for which you can observe the devastation in real time. That's right let's talk about...
Spills
It is shocking to me the sheer amount of people who simply have no idea how often oil pipelines break. The answer is... they rarely don't break.
In one two year period analyzed by the state Health Department found nearly 300 oil spills that were largely unreported to the public. One of these was the largest onshore spill in US history saturating water and farmland in the surrounding area with approximately 20,000 barrels worth of crude oil. This decimates local wildlife, kills crops, makes fields barren, and makes people sick. In fact, the pipeline was originally supposed to go closer to Bismarck, yet they moved it further away from the city. Yet the assure us that the pipe won't break and contaminate water. Well, if that were the case, why not put it right through Bismarck?
==The Police==
If there is one thing that no reasonable person can deny, it is that the police have shown an unwarranted, unreasonable, and unacceptable amount of force towards peaceful protesters. Let's get this straight. These protests are peaceful. Only one side has the weapons here, so the use of ""less-lethal"" weapons on people who pose no threat to you is hideous, unacceptable, and, above all, illegal. These police are using military-style riot control tactics, but there is no riot, it is a peaceful protest, so that right there is strikes 1-3. You don't ever use weapons on protesters. That's not what America is about. So how exactly has have the police violated the rights of the protesters and the constitution they swore an oath to uphold?
Use of rubber bullets on non-threatening civilians
Rubber bullets are a ""less-lethal"" riot control weapon. They are used to control violent and out of control riots. They are meant to be used at a range of approximately 100yds and shot at the ground so they skip up and sting people in the legs. What we have seen at Standing Rock does not match this description at all.
First of all, the protesters are completely peaceful, so there should be no riot control measures at all. Yet what we see is not police shooting at the ground, but there are videos of police firing directly at protesters from close range. There have been several dozen people sent to the hospital, concussions, broken bones, internal bleeding. They have been lucky though. 1 in 45 people shot with rubber bullets die, and 1 in 22 and 1 in 5 suffer permanent damage. This is not something you should be taking so lightly.
Freezing Water
This one goes without saying. Since when is it okay in America for police to literally spray freezing water at protesters? That's sounds like something that they did in Soviet Russia. The only positive thing about this is it shows how bullshit the governor's evacuation for the protester's safety in the wake of the snowstorm really is. He wasn't worried about them getting cold when he was freezing them with water!
Mace
This is supposed to be used for self-defense like pepper spray, but look online. You can find videos of police running up to people and macing them in the face. Not cool.
Dogs
More video evidence can be seen on youtube and many other places of cops literally just letting their dogs go nuts at protesters for nothing.
Tear Gas
Banned in warefare as a chemical weapon. Potentially lethal. Used on peaceful protesters liberally.
Concussion Grenades
Tons of eyewitnesses to confirm the use of concussion grenades by the police. One nearly took off that Sophia girl's arm. Police lie saying that she was making an IED? Really? So you expect me to believe that the protesters who have shown NO violence so far all of the sudden were trying to commit an act of violence, and police, who have been violent all along, are the innocent ones. Right. They even have pulled fragments of the grenade from her flesh and plan to use it as evidence in court.
Mass Arrests
There have been countless instances of people arrested in mass numbers, without charges, without rights read, and without habeas corpus. Independent journalists have been targeted in particular. One independent journalist was arrested for livestreaming the protest. What law that violates in a mystery to me.
The police have even jammed signals from drones after footage from the drones showed the company drilling against the order of the US Department of Justice and the ACoE.
So this is why I am against DAPL, please share your thoughts.

personalfinance,Reality Check For Wanting To Purchase First Home? (24),"Hi,

Wanted to spew my plan here and hopefully get a reality check if I am going about things wrong. 

My fiancee and I (23/24) are getting married next fall and would like to purchase our first home shortly after getting married. Our rental lease expires at this exact time too, so it all sort of falls into place. 

I have a pretty set budget already, but I will lay out the finances below. Incomes are separate right now, but once married, everything will be combined. 

Income:

* Mine: $55k 
* Hers: $30k 

Debt: 

* Mine: None
* Hers: Student Loans. $5k private (Will be paid off in a few months). $34k federal 3.4% (Approved for IBR, so the current monthly minimum is $80) 

Current Monthly Budget: 

* Rent: $985
* Groceries: $300
* Utilities: $120 (Water + Electric)
* Internet: $56
* Parking For Work: $110
* Gas: $75
* Insurance (Auto + Renters): $120
* Fun Money (going out): $200
* Misc: $75
* Total: $2k / $5k total take home

Other Stuff: 

* Investments: $14k (My 401k + IRA)
* Current amount set aside for down-payment: $10k. I should have another 10-15k set aside over the next year. So this puts us at a down-payment of 20-25k. 
* Other cash (Outside of house savings): 10k (emergency fund + month buffer in checking)

We have set our house budget at $255k. This is 3x our combined income once we are married and gives us plenty of options in our area. A handful of houses I am interested in are &lt;200k. Currently targeting 3-4 bedroom, 2.5 bath houses. 

By next fall, when we will be looking for a house, I will have $20-25k in a savings account for the house. I have 10k in my IRA but I would rather not pull from that. My thoughts are to put 5% down. Assuming we buy at the top of our budget, 5% on 255k is $12,750. That leaves 5% remaining for closing costs (I read they are between 2-5%?).

I am pretty clueless of the whole process and am already getting overwhelmed. I was hoping for a bit of a reality check here if I am completely out of my element. 

I am happy to answer any questions to provide more information.

Thank you!",finance,1480537983
personalfinance,Stock In Kind as part of 401k withdrawal?,"Just looking for clarification, no 'coulda woulda shoulda' necessary.

My question is why was part of the withdrawal 'distributed' as Stock In Kind??? I understand that money taken from the total amount goes to state and federal taxes before they cut the check...

personalfinance,[Debt] Just refinanced $100K+ in Graduate Loans,"Hi PF,

Throwaway since there's personal info and some friends know my username. I wanted to share the great relief and news I received these past few weeks now that everything is signed and established. I recently refinanced over $100K in Graduate Loans through a smaller bank (though still national) and will save my wife and I almost $16K over the next 10 years. 

A bit of background: My wife and I have been living together since we were 19 and shared all finances since I went to work and she went to law school when we graduated undergrad. During law school I supported us both, and we got married last year right before she got her bar results (pass!). When she graduated, her loans were a little over $110K, with an expected repayment of around $151K with a consolidated interest rate of about 6.8%. I wanted to try to pay it down as quickly as possible while still allowing us to save for a home in the relative future. We were looking at 10 years of $1260 per month. I have a 795-805 credit score and make $90K annually, and shes just under 750 and makes $45K annually. 

Refinancing: I knew the 6.8% was outrageous to carry over 10 years and spent the last year looking into refinancing. I tried talking to Chase (our primary bank) with no luck, tried SoFi with no luck, and a few other companies that reached out via mail. The lowest rate we could find was 6% fixed. Long story short, I met a banker at an event that works at our new bank and we got to talking. She encouraged me to come in and apply and within two weeks, we completed the refinance process at a new fixed interest rate of 2.95%!

Old plan - $1260 x 9 (1 year into 10 year repayment) x 12 = $136,080
New plan - $1002 x 10 x 12 = $120,240
Savings = $15,840

Note* - Yes I co-signed on the refinance. I fully understand that before refinancing, I was not liable for the original loans since we weren't married until after law school. I supported my wife's decision to go to law school and knew the financial responsibility it included.

I haven't included the name of the bank in case it's against sub rules and didn't want to seem like an ad. Happy to share the name of the bank if it's cool.

Edit: For clarity, we also left Chase closing all accounts except for Credit Card. Our new bank's savings account provides a .05% interest rate instead of Chase's abysmal .01%. It may not be much but it's something. They also don't have the random $5 monthly service fee that is waived by jumping through 6 hoops.

stocks,$KBE before and after an interest rate hike,"So my understanding (mostly coming from economics and banking classes) is that a bank is more profitable with higher interest rates because they have a higher spread.

When looking at the bank etf $KBE, it shows that the price took a hit after rates were increased December of 2015. 

Was this because of the interest hike, or was there another factor that caused bank stocks to slip in early 2016?
