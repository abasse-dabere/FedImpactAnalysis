investing,I'm calling a market crash,"We are hitting record highs. When was the last time we heard this? Oh... 2007. It has also been some years since the cyclical storms have raged. Ergo, each day that passes is one day closer to the next recession, or even a depression. The federal reserve has been pumping and dumping the economy into states of boom and bust for a long time already, there's no reason here to expect they will not continue to do the same, perhaps even dump us into another great depression. 

My warning to the growing herd of perma-bulls would be to stop trying to time the market, and expect that they will know when to sell out their gains before stock prices come collapsing down. It never works.",finance,1480550486

I pay very aggressively in order of interest rate and have 4 loans left to pay, currently almost done with what currently has the highest rate.

personalfinance,Setting up fund for parents,"Hi everybody,

My parents have always been bad with money.  They always want to invest in things like real estate and other lucrative ventures because of the promise of high interest rates and returns.  They are now in their mid-50's and still don't really have a concrete plan in regards to their retirement.  Is there a fund I can set up for my parents where I can continue to put in money and have it grow for them to be able to use either in their 60's or even 70's?  It wouldn't be a lot of money (maybe like $50-$100/month) but I would like for them to see the funds continue to build up and how the interest would add to it so that they can see how they can perhaps  put their money towards something similar as opposed to always wanting to buy a condo or house with money they don't have. At the very least, they'll have money for them when they're older.

I've looked at options such as CDs and Savings Bonds but they're not exactly something I can continuously pour money into.  I live in California in case that might play a factor.  Thanks!",finance,1480559366
personalfinance,I need to be told if I'm right or wrong: Kinda pissed at my bank,"Going to summarize this with mostly facts and then what happened.

 - I declared Bankruptcy (Chapter 7) in October of 2014.

 - I've significantly improved my credit score in the past couple of months by disputing some things that were not accurate.  Because of that, my credit score (according to CreditKarma) is somewhere between 680 - 700.  This is just about the highest it's ever been.  I'm actually pretty proud of this considering.

 - I'm trying to save for a house.  Getting married in October of 2017, would love to be in a position to purchase in mid to late 2018. 

So, all that leads me to this.  I called my bank to discuss my account and while I was on the phone, the banker (who I later found out is the Branch Manager) tried to talk me to converting a Secure $300 Credit Card with nothing on it to a more conventional card.  My current card has interest somewhere around 25% and an annual fee of $24.  I've had it for about two years, got it just after the Bankruptcy.  It may be also worth noting that I have a card with Chase with a $2000 limit and not much on it (just bought a PS4 for Black Friday, so I'm thinking around $250ish).

I told her that I'd come in to discuss my options.  Came in the bank today and sat down with her for a bit.  

I let her know what my intentions are.  I would love to qualify for a home in late 2018.  I make a heck of a lot more then I spend every month and am in a position to save for this objective.  I'd also like to minimize my interest rate going into it, although being only 4 years into a Bankruptcy could really complicate it.  I'm aware of this.

She pushed on me filing for this Credit Card.  She said there was no way I'd qualify for a Home Loan with only two lines of Credit.  I told her I wasn't comfortable really applying for the card without my fiance's input.  She said she could only help me plan if I applied so she knew what she was dealing with.  

I gave in.  I'm pissed at myself for this.  I fucking know better than letting me make that decision against my better judgement.

I was, of course, declined.  She acted surprised that I wasn't and said more-or-less that I should have known with the Bankruptcy being so soon.

The part that really pissed me off is after the decline, I wanted to still talk about the path to Homeownership.  She then informed me that because I didn't qualify for the card, there really wasn't anything she could do for me.  

I stated my dismay, considering the only f-ing reason I applied is that she said she'd have to see my credit to help me ""plan.""  And now she wasn't going to help me even?

I'm switching banks.  I called the Corporate office and complained but think it's going nowhere.  

Am I being silly here?   Part of me feels that it was extremely unethical and that I was lead on.  I did say yes to her applying for a Credit Card for me.  But I feel the way I was guided to that decision was not with the best intentions.  However, at the end of the day, I did give her permission.

I kinda want to write and voice my concern but not sure where and am not sure if I'm being silly.  I've banked with the same bank for all my adult life.  I'm pretty livid right now.",finance,1480560213

personalfinance,"New job starting next year, how to balance financial priorities","Hi there,

I am 25 and about to start a new job in February. I was hoping you all might be able to help me out organizing what my financial priorities should be. I have next to nothing saved up because of some traveling and low-paying salaries; I have a small job right now, but I won't be able to save up much more than a couple thousand before I move for the new job (the company will be covering my moving expenses). I'm pretty much just in Conservation Mode until I start. I owe about $4,500 on a school loan with a 3.5% interest rate (I've been making $56 payments every month for the past two years). Rent in the new town will likely be around $1,000 to $1,300 plus utilities. Health insurance will cost $90/month. I don't have a car, and can stay on my family's cell plan until I'm steady on my feet.

I will be making about $4,000 net per month in my new position, and will probably receive my first paycheck at the end of February. I was wondering where I should put that money first. Here are my options, as I see them:
A). Opening a Roth IRA and, if not maxing out 2016 contributions, then putting in all I can. I know that the deadline for contributing is mid-April, so at that point I will have only received two paychecks.
B). Paying down my loan completely, to minimize the interest I will have to pay in the future.
C). Starting off contributing to my company's 401K. They'll match up to 50% of the first 6% of my income contributed (maxing out at $5K), based on company performance. It will be 20% vested after two years and 100% after five years.

I'm having trouble seeing where I should be directing this new income and how to balance money choices at the very start. Right now, I'm leaning towards maxing out 2016 Roth IRA contributions and participating in the 401K plan at a very limited rate (like 3-4%, which I think is the automatic starting point for our company's plan), while upping my loan payments slightly to something like $100. I don't have a car, though, and I would like to save up and buy one pretty quickly once I've moved. I realize that most of this could be sorted out with the flowchart, but I don't want to miss out on this year's IRA contributions and I feel like I can put off the school loan for a little bit before I get myself established. Is that foolish? Do you usually follow the flowchart when making your money decisions, or do you have a system that works for you better?

Coming from a job where I was making just about zilch, I really quite desperately want to be at a good place financially where I'm actually looking out for the future, and maybe even where I'm able to help out my family when needed. Any help you could see to give me would be VERY much appreciated. I always love how helpful people can be on this sub, and the different insights that come from people who have had similar situations. I look forward to hearing your advice!

personalfinance,"$70k in student loan debt, have been denied by two refinancing institutions, could use some advice","It's a long story, but the short version (for me cause I talk a lot) is this:  


As an 18 year old applying for colleges, my parents said not to worry, they would take care of everything - so I graduated in 2010 with about 20k in student loan debt.  That debt is now down to about 5k and I pay 75 a month on it.  Last February, I got a call from the loan provider, ACS Education, saying 3 loans totaling about $80,000 were over 3 months past due and were on the verge of 4.  I called my now retired parents, and basically found out my mother had no idea of their finances, that they were essentially bankrupt and that my dad was just going to let them come after him and declare bankruptcy (although my understanding is that wouldn't help with student loans).  

Thing is, I didn't realize that at 18 (poor excuse, I know, but at this point it is what it is), one of the many papers i signed was me being a cosigner on that loan, so it impacted my credit and is something I need to take care of.   I took on the loan and got it current, and my intention was to start paying it off and refinance it and help my parents because they were drowning under it and other debt too.  I have tried two different agencies - SoFi and Earnest - and have been denied because of the past delinquency that hit my credit when I was the cosigner.  I'm handling it now, but I'm now not saving any money anymore, and occasionally if a bonus check isn't heavy enough I take a step back.  I could use some real advice, here are my details:

Savings - $12,000

Loans (that i took from parents):  $13,285.96/$21,942.81/$34,342.59.  Interest rates of 8%, 8% and 11.5%

Personal Student Loan: 5k, monthly payments of 75

Current Monthly payment: $929.39

Yearly income: $55,000 (with bonuses about $60k to $65k)

Rent:$800/month

Other debt/expenses: $400 on one credit card, and my girlfriend and I typically use our shared credit card for all other purchases, which totals around 500 a month

ACS has a refinance option, but it is really just a kick the can type of thing.  25% of monthly payments for 6 months, 50% of monthly payments for 6 months, and then a year of just paying the interest.  But that would just leave me with larger payments down the line.

Before my credit was hit by all this, it was good but not great, 680.  I would really appreciate any ideas on how to best go about pay this off since I can't refinance and not start going into the red.  Thanks!

personalfinance,Formula for which debt to pay off when you can deduct interest?,"Lets say I have 3 loans and I wont be taking the standard deduction.

One is a student loan of which I can deduct the interest, the others are a mortgage and car loan.

The student loan(s) vary from 4.5-6.8%, the mortgage is ~4%, and the car loan is 2%.

If I had a chunk of $XX,XXX to put towards a loan, how would I determine the best loan to go after since I have to factor in deductible interest payments? I'm sure my tax rate will factor in which is 25%.

It seems to me going after the highest interest-rate loans will still be the best plan of action here, but I'd like to see it proven mathematically and now I'm curious how close the interest rates would have to be for it to make sense to pay a lower-interest, non deductible loan first.

personalfinance,I need advice about my low credit score.x-posted to r/cRedit. (Very long post),"**Warning* This is a really long post. 

I'm 22 years old and I'm trying to be financially responsible and stay on top of my credit score, because I know how important it is, both now and later in life. 

That being said, my credit score is in the high 500's and I don't know why. 

**Details** 

I have only two accounts on my credit score. 

1. Opened March 2015, I have a Capital One Secured card. I opened it with a $200 deposit to secure a $200 limit, and about 6 months later increased my limit to $500. (I didn't have to pay another $300 deposit to do this, so I guess that only $200 of my limit is secured and the other $300 isn't? I'm not exactly sure how that works). I only opened it to start building credit history because I knew I would need to buy a car within the year. I went with this card because it was the only company that would approve me with zero credit history and no cosigner (more on that later). Anyway, that's my only credit card. 

2. A car loan that I acquired in August 2015 of about $20k at a high interest rate. 

*Those two accounts are the only accounts on my credit score. I have no other credit cards, I graduated college without any debt, and never took out any student loans.*

**Details about my car loan**

I went to several different dealerships to try to get financed for a car, all but one of them flat out declined me because I had ""no credit history"" even though I had 6 months history of a single credit card. I know that isn't much but I feel like I should have had some sort of score other than 000 when they ran my social. I also didn't have a cosigner. My parents were more than helpful in helping me find a car that worked for me and a dealership that would finance me, but they couldn't cosign for me. (They had perfect credit until I was a teenager and then ended up in some financial trouble and did what they could to get us out of it. They got us out of it, but it ruined their credit. Their credit is just now starting to improve, years after all this went down)

So I took the loan that the one dealership would give me. It might be worth noting that this wasn't some Cars4Cheap scammy used car lot. I went to a reputable local dealership. Think like *Honda of Orlando* Or *Nissan of Nashville"". I ended up getting one of their Certified Pre Owned cars with pretty low mileage. Fortunately, I liked the car a lot and it was exactly what I needed. I desperately needed a car. My old beater had broke down and I couldn't buy another crappy car as I was commuting to college every day and clocking a lot of mileage. I'm happy to have such a reliable car because I now drive about 350 miles a week, 70 miles round trip to work 5 days a week. It's a great car that was a great price. However, the loan was at a very high rate. I'm talking double digits interest rate. But, being without a car, without any credit history and without a cosigner, and without any other offers from any other lenders, had no choice but to take it. 

When I asked about eventually refinancing to get out of the high interest rate, I was told that I had to stay with their financial service for one year, before I could refinance with an outside lender. But as long as I made all of my payments on time and kept up with my credit card payments, in a year I would build enough credit history to be able to refinance somewhere else. 

I thought that sounded alright, as did my parents. I could deal with the high payments for a year and at that point, after being turned down by several other dealerships, I felt lucky to be getting a loan at all. 

So I wrote a check for the small amount of money that I had for a down payment, and signed on all the dotted lines and drove the car home that day. 


**The Problem**

I've desperately been trying to refinance this car loan, but my credit score is too low. I've been denied every time with every lender. 

It's been over a year since I got my car loan. I've made every single payment on time. 

It's been over a year and a half since I opened my credit card. In that time, I've only made one payment late, which I know is terrible, but for some reason it completely slipped my mind for over a month. Other than the one late payment, I've paid it off in full on a monthly basis about 80% of the time. The other 19% of the time I've made more than the minimum payment (the 1% being the time I forgot about it). 

My car payment is pretty high. I can pay it, but it's about 25% of my monthly income. I don't make very much money, so that's a pretty decent hit on my income. And a payment of that size means sacrificing other things, like paying rent on an apartment in the city that I work in, so I don't have to commute 70 miles a day. Not that I could get a lease anywhere that requires  a credit check because my credit score is too low. 

So my final question is, why do I have such a bad credit score? I don't understand the credit system well enough to figure out why it's so low. 

I don't have student loans, I'm not drowning in credit card debt, and I make my payments on time. 

How did I get here and how do I fix it? 

Any advice is appreciated.

personalfinance,ELI5: Investment Account Returns,"Hi everyone,

Please let me know if this is not the right place for this question.  Anyway, hopefully it’s really simple and I’m just missing something.  I understand how returns on bank accounts work- savings accounts, CDs, etc. as well as bonds.  You put in an amount, say $100 dollars, and if they pay an interest rate of 1%, over the next year, you will receive about $1 in interest.  Over time this compounds and so on and so forth.  Simple enough.

But now that I am getting ready to open up my first official “Investment” account (probably Roth IRA), I just can’t understand how returns on accounts like these work.  I understand that when buying stocks, you can earn dividends (but not always), and then if the stock increase in value, sell your shares for a profit.  However, I keep reading that long term investment portfolios average about 7%.  How exactly does this work?
Is this essentially saying that if I put $100 in an account, by the end of a 20 year period, the account will then be worth essentially what it would be if it had been earning 7% interest annually?  How does this work?  With bank accounts, interest compounds on a regular basis, but with stocks, (aside from the dividends) isn’t the only change in value when you sell? If a stock price is only up a few percentage points from buying to selling, I don’t see how that could possibly equate to 7% annually since that is a one-time event, unless the dividends themselves are returning on average 7% yearly.  Sorry if this is hard to understand, I’m really confused… I’ve read books, and a ton of on-line resources and none state this clearly.  

Thanks!

EDIT:  WOW, this has been immensely helpful! I really appreciate all of this... truly amazing the kindness of others to help teach me!  

Now that I understand how this works, it seems like everyone is in agreement that the main return on stocks is their increased value over time.  In that case, my next question is, why would you buy stocks now, when they are all doing relatively well (and at a high price) and possibly due for a downturn?  
...Let's say I invest right now, and in 5 years, prices are up 10% which is great, but in 5 years, the market has a downturn and overall everything is down -5% (from the original investment), but then over the next 10 years they are up to point where its averages to the 7% annual return.  That's all fine and dandy...
But wouldn't you be better off just waiting for the markets to go down and buying then? (since technically during those first ten years, there has been NO appreciation and all that matters in terms of returns are the last 10 years?)",finance,1480612583

My thoughts as of now are to either contact a credit counseling service and consolidate my loans into one payment, rather than paying $600 a month on high interest credit cards. 
Or, Should I start with the biggest debt or the highest APR? How much should I pay? Should I focus on one account and pay minimum+interest on the others?
Truck Loan? Stupid balloon payment loan, expensive, affordable at the time I took out a loan? Probably not, another stupid decision on my part. 
Thoughts?

Then all of a sudden it just seemed to pile up on me like a bad avalanche, and here I am, totally overwhelmed, broke, and lost on what i should do. Honestly, i don’t trust the aforementioned companies or any financial institutions for the most part. This is why I am reaching out to everyone on here.

personalfinance,Refinancing mortgage a good idea?,"Our mortgage lender recently sent a letter asking if we would like to refinance our home. We've had it for 2 years, and our interest rate is 4.125%. They said they could lower it down to 3.5% and would incur a fee of 1% of the home's outstanding loan ($2.4k). It is a 30 year loan, and we could afford the 1% fee, but we'd have to cut into some funds that we had different plans for. And would it make a difference? 

We also pay PMI on our home, but it seems our home value has increased. Accodring to Zillow, it's about $48k (18% increase) more than the Zestimate when we bought it, and $55k more than what it was assessed as (assessment came in $7k lower than the Zestimate). 

I know the Zestimate isn't something we should be basing everything off of, but I just wanted to put some numbers into perspective. If we refinance, would we need a new assessment and be able to wipe the PMI? I don't really know enough about this, and a lot of information online is confusing.",finance,1480615775

I've gotten multiple quotes on this (from private practice and dental schools) and they've all been roughly similar. The work needs to be done at some point but it isn't pressing and doesn't need to be done right this moment. 

I need help determining A) if I can even afford this B) how best to use $15,000 in savings (for this work or student loans) and C) if there are any other options I should explore.

Student Loans:

Amount Owed | Interest Rate
-----------|-------------
$3065.09 | 5.6
$3734.33 | 4.5

$5047.14 | 3.4

$1413.17 | 3.86
$2146.79 | 3.86

**Total: $21,939.48**

Currently monthly payment: $300

Minimum payment: $151.79

Savings: $15,000

Total cost of dental work: $38,000

Loan Provider | Loan Term | Interest Rate | Est. Monthly Payment
-------------|---------|-------------|--------------------
SoFi | 7 yr | 8-13% | $591-694

Gas: $50-ish

Misc. reoccurring expenses: $55 (web-hosting, Makerspace, gym, Wikipedia donation, an app)

So after everything that leaves me with about $605 leftover for anything else. 

I kinda see two options here:

1) Use $15,000 in savings to reduce the personal loan to about $23,000 and lower monthly payments by about $200 or so. Benefits include saving money on interest in the long run. Downside is I'll be $45,000 in debt and a very significant chunk of my income will be going towards debt payments. I'm afraid with such a high debt to income ratio that it could be difficult for me obtain a car loan or mortgage in the future. 

2) Save aggressively for the next 6-8 months or so and use savings to eliminate student loans entirely. Given my track record of saving, this is doable. After that, I can look into getting the dental work done. The benefits I see to this are having considerably less debt and being free of the mental burden of student loans. Downside is obviously I'd need a personal loan for the full amount of $38,000. 

I'm not really sure which option to take. Am I missing anything? What else should I consider?",finance,1480618172

I've been paying minimum payments each month, amounting in total to about $500-550. On most I haven't even gotten through paying the interest.

I don't pay rent or car payments, nor any regular bills other than subscriptions to services. I also donate about $160 each month to my church.

I have a credit card which I use regularly only to help build my credit back up, and to help as a safety net in case I run out of cash before my paycheck comes through, and then I immediately pay it off.

My credit has recovered to a point somewhere between 550 &amp; 600. 

Times haven't hit me ""hard"", but because I entered the ""real world"" during the recession, I know things can get hard again. With a car whose mileage is reaching 160k, I'm also having to pay at least once a year to have something patched up.

The downside is I cannot seem to get a good cash flow to sustain me. That is, I can't build up my bank account. Each month I have at least one period where it comes to counting down to my next paycheck, hoping an automatic payment doesn't go through before the paycheck does.

I'm also building up my retirement investment at work. So I'm always debating whether to throw more money to that, or at my debt, or into my bank account.

I also see my student loans, and feel that realistically, I can't pay them off for another 6-10 years at my current rate, which sucks since I would like to get my own place to rent, and eventually to get married and start a family with a lot of children.

I haven't consolidated my loans, because I've been afraid of what consequences could come in any form (I'm somewhat ignorant of finances, though I try to be frugal). I have no clue what refinancing is or does, and so I haven't thought about that either.

gaming,"GameStop overcharged me, billed me for items that were free, and then refused to refund me.","So I was really pumped to order a PS4 on Cyber Monday. I found the best deal through a GameStop online-only deal. I'm now wondering if it was the best deal because of how much they save on customer service.

The story:

I ordered the PS4 500GB Uncharted 4 bundle that comes with 2 free games (The Last of Us Remastered and Ratchet &amp; Clank).

I was elated when it came! I opened the box and found that..huh..odd Ratchet and Clank isn't in the box (*EDIT* *I'm leaving this in because it was in the original post. However, the fine print on the order page DID state that items could ship separately. I simply missed the fine print and that was nothing but my own fault. Sorry for the incorrect information here*). Then I checked the receipt. Not only did it not match what I agreed to, but they CHARGED me for TLOU!

I figured it was a messup so I'd check my bank account...oh..they charged me even more! **So the email receipt, receipt in box, and actual amount charged are ALL different.**

http://imgur.com/gallery/8cbTf

I figured I'd just get this sorted out, so I called GameStop. After *70 minutes* on hold, I was connected to a rep.

After providing the order number and yada yada I explained the situation. The rep checked their system and advised they had only billed me $285. I said my bank states quite differently, and even the paper receipt says different. 

I asked them to refund me the amount they overcharged. The rep absolutely refused to do this. I then offered to email or upload pictures of the various charges to *prove* they indeed overcharged me. Unfortunately to my surprise the rep refused to even let me send over evidence!

I immediately requested to speak to a supervisor - after being on hold for another few minutes she came back and advised they wouldn't refund me, and that I wouldn't be able to speak to a supervisor.

I had finally run out of time, and after 2 hours of trying to fix this came out empty handed and overcharged. This particularly annoys me since the overcharge brought the particular card I used within SIX CENTS of over drafting.

This is the single worst customer service experience I have ever had. I really don't want to go to my bank and do a chargeback as typically companies really dislike that. I figured I'd post here both as a warning to others and a last plea for help before I go to my bank to resolve this.

______________________________________________________________________________________
**UPDATE**

I went to the GameStop near me. They confirmed this bundle existed - and was Ratchet and Clank AND The Last of Us Remastered AND Uncharted 4. I looked in my history - here's the URL to the bundle (doesn't exist now so errors) - 
http://www.gamestop.com/ps4/consoles/playstation-4-uncharted-4-500gb-bundle-with-free-the-last-of-us-**and**-ratchet-clank/139295

Long story short the manager refused to refund me, said if I charged back I would be blacklisted from purchasing from GameStop, and told me to call CS again. I called my bank and they sorted it all out in about 10 minutes.

__________________________________________________________________________

**UPDATE 2**

I've yet to receive any response whatsoever from the company. I've posted on their FB, created this Reddit thread, and opened two different tickets (one includes imgur links to evidence).

All I've received thus far is an automatic 'We got your ticket' email. It has only been about 48hours, but I'd really hoped for some kind of anything given the gravity of the issue and the noise I've made about it.

and also the International Business Times: http://www.ibtimes.com/gamestop-accused-overcharging-customer-cyber-monday-retailer-refuses-refund-2453770

personalfinance,What should I pay off next?,"Ok, we just started getting serious about our debt.

Since getting on a budget in March, we've taken two vacations and paid off 3 debts. My Christmas bonus from work is $755 after taxes. We are set for Christmas, we have money in savings, and I'm focused on our next debt.

Our next smallest credit card debt is Lowe's, which is $1348. Thanks to snowballing, we are paying an extra $605 plus the minimum to whatever debt is in line (in this case, the minimum payment on the Lowe's card is $48, so it won't be a huge amount to add to the snowball figure). That should be the next, because it's the highest interest and a low balance.

HOWEVER...

My student loan balance is only $755.78. It seems stupid to pay off the thing with the lowest interest rate, but the minimum payment is $126/month to pay it off by May.

The Lowe's card would be paid off in January anyway, and paying off the student loan wouldn't change that.

I know I'm rambling and I'm not being really clear and I'm sorry for that. It seems against the grain to pay off the lowest interest balance (when the interest is a write off), but the writeoff for the interest isn't exactly going to be a huge part of our return anyway.

So, what would you do? Combine the bonus with the snowball money to pay off the Lowe's balance, or payoff the student loans and have a much bigger snowball?",finance,1480627108

personalfinance,Getting Close to Next Tax Bracket.,"Hello Personal Finance,

I had a question regarding tax brackets. I am a single filer, in the United States, and from the federal brackets I have googled, I am currently in the 15% tax bracket, ( &lt; $37,650), but I will be much too close for comfort to going over the $37,650 limit and into the next bracket, which is 25%. I was wondering, if I contribute my last few weeks of earnings 100% to my Traditional IRA, wouldn't that keep me from going over, and being taxed an additional 10%? Is this a smart move, or will I still be taxed more due to my total gross income being over the tax-bracket? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1480627954
personalfinance,Should/can I refinance my car loan?,"Hi Guys,

I have been looking into refinancing my auto loan to see if I could possibly lower the interest rate on it, but I don't know if I am already at a great deal at the moment. 

I bought a 2013 Kia Forte in May of 2015 with a loan amount of $16,870. I believe my interest rate is 6.49% and a 72-month lease. My current monthly payments are $275, and I'm at my 18-month mark. 

At the time that I bought my car, I didn't have any credit to my name at all. After I bought it, I've been making my payments on time with no issues and I opened 2 credit cards and make those payments on time too. My credit score now is 755, so I was hoping that the better score could lower my rates. 

My question is, if I want to look into refinancing, should I just try to refinance with the same loan company I have right now, or should I look elsewhere? Or maybe I am already getting a good deal and should just stick to what I've got now. I'm as clueless as a gold fish.

Thank you for your time and help. :)",finance,1480629941

gaming,Idea for a Marvel based MOBA,"Bear with me, this is my first post on Reddit and it's going to be a long one. I am a huge fan of the game Smite and had an idea for a 3rd Person Marvel themed MOBA. I don't have much now and like I said it's still an Idea, but what I do have are a list of 25 characters to start out with and 10 characters that have abilities so far. 

There are 2 main damage types: Energy and Physical, and 5 different classes with characters that aren't limited to there lane or role. 

The 5 classes are as follows: Defenders (Solo laners or warriors) Rangers (ADC type characters) Titans (Tanks or Guardians) Assasins and Omegas (Mages) 

Some characters use energy (mana) and some do not use mana and just rely on cooldowns to function. Characters of different roles are not limited to strictly mana and strictly cooldown, this means that certain Titans do not have to use mana, and Certain Omegas (so far only 1) do not have to use mana. Additionally some characters do not have passive abilities, and certain characters do not have ultimate abilities. 

Under the Defender class so far we have : Captain America, Reed Richards, Rogue, Ghost Rider, and Psylocke.
Rangers: Cyclops, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Gambit, and the Punisher
Titans: The Hulk, Juggernaut, The Thing, Venom, and Colossus
Assasins: Night Crawler, Wolverine, Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Black Widow
Omegas: Dr Strange, Susan Storm, Jean Grey, Dr. Doom, and Storm

Characters will be able to build up to 7 items that will have the typical stats you seen in a MOBA, i.e: Penetration, Crit, Hp5 and more

I will now be getting into the 10 characters I have so far:

Bitcoin,Feedback on Bitcoin startup idea?,"Hi everyone! I currently run Hodl Hardware Shop (hodl.co) and am an MBA student. I am thinking about starting a Bitcoin company sometime next year and would love to get your feedback on my startup idea. 

Right now I hodl lots of coins but don't spend any. One reason is because I use my American Express card for all online purchases. I do this for a few reasons.

1. I like paying off a bill at the end of every month.
2. I don't like exposing my debit card number.
3. A few times a year I depend on Amex's purchase protection (can dispute anything and they offer an assisted return service) and extended warranty (they double manufacture's warranty for all purchases).
4. I like getting points.
5. Lots of travel benefits.
6. They offer other great services like a high yield savings account.
7. I can carry a balance for purchases over $100 (interest rates in line with other credit cards).

I would use Bitcoin to buy things online if it offered these features (except #2, which is obviously irrelevant).

Therefore I am thinking about starting a company that works like an Amex card. You'd be able to make Bitcoin purchases but would not spend your own coins – you'd spend my company's coins, and then at the end of the month you would pay off your balance.

You would have the option to upload a receipt of your purchase, which would then give you purchase protection and extended warranty benefits.

You would also get points (or some form of cash-back) and travel benefits.

You would also have the ability to carry a balance on larger purchases, with interest rates much lower than existing credit cards (aiming for around 5-7%).

I know there are some challenges:

1. I would need a large Bitcoin reserve.
2. I would need to charge for the service (probably).
3. I would need to address volatility in Bitcoin price, which could cause people to pay more or less than the original value of the purchase.
4. I would need to credit check everyone and collect identity information (right)?

What do you all think? This is definitely a service I would use, but I am not sure if anyone else would! Your feedback is very very valuable to me. Thanks so much everyone!

personalfinance,"Sanity check: if I make excellent money but have a house under PMI, I should focus on paying down to below the threshold for PMI first, correct?","I mostly know I'm doing the right thing (I think, anyway), but I'd like a sanity check.

I'm fortunate to have a very nice job. I've got a $20,000 safety net built up. Our only debts are our cars (1.59% interest rate, so no big gains by paying that off early) and our house. No credit card debt (I use the safety net as our own personal ""lender"" for credit, so we ""borrow"" from ourselves and automatically pay back some of what we borrow each month), no student loan debt (paid off about six months ago), no other kind of debt at all.

Due to some craziness with our mortgage, though, we initially ended up financing about 87% of it (we already owned the land, so the value of the land was the down payment on the house, but construction ran over-budget, so the value of the land ended up being a smaller portion of the construction cost than anticipated, and I don't know why I'm including this much detail). So, we're subject to PMI, which runs about $100 per month.

The last four months I've pulled together about another $10,000 on top of our $20,000 safety net, and I'm tempted to just throw it all at the mortgage. It would be enough to get us down to around 81% financed, so we'd be able to ditch PMI in the next couple months. Is that the best course of action before looking into the other targets I have in mind for that money (retirement, 529, short-term investing)?

(And while I'm here, a side question: right now, our escrow balance with our bank is negative. The reason is because the county's initial appraisal was about $150,000 too high, which caused a much higher property tax rate. The appraisal has been lowered, and next year's property tax payment will reflect that, but is there any harm in leaving escrow negative unless the bank calls and bothers me about it? I could pay out of pocket to even it out now, but I don't know if there's any reason to.)",finance,1480656422

One of the amazing offers of my job is the 401k matching, with is a match at 100% up to $3,000. This means that if I contribute $3,000 to my 401k each year, my work will match it dollar for dollar. In addition to that, if I contribute more than that annually they will match at 50%. This means that if I contribute more than $3,000 and up. For example, if I contributed the federal contribution limit of $18,000, my work will contribute an extra $9,000.  
  
I make a guaranteed 98k a year and an additional 15% annual target bonus that is based on performance. Based on how long I've been here, I am expecting a 3k bonus when it comes.

But apparently, that concept only applies to financial advice. And apparently, when I'm refinancing my student loans with you, you can offer me any raw, shitty deal you want, and probably will, because you make your money through bribes, and the deals that are worst for me will probably bribe you the most.

So I feel like, no matter how I refinance, I'm being taken advantage of.

What's the least terrible way for me to refinance my student loans? Is there anybody I can *kinda* trust? Is there any company for which bribes are only *part* of their decision-making process?

Edit: Alright, here's an oversimplified example of what I mean, since people here apparently don't understand why I referenced fiduciaries:

There are two banks hiding somewhere. They are both willing to offer a 3% interest rate. But they want to pay the refinancing company too. So I end up paying a 3.5% interest rate if I go with bank A (.5% to the refinancing company), or 4% if I go with bank B (1% to the refinancing company). I want the refinancing company that is going to recommend bank A, rather than bank B.",finance,1480687880
personalfinance,Need to rebuild and I think I have the right idea but I've thought that before.,"Well I'll keep this short and sweet. (failed) I want to be firefighter after spending most of my 20's ignoring what I want to do and just coasting through life. 

My credit is crap (low 600's) and my fiance has no credit. Hell the bank said she has 0 reporting. 

My goal was to get a 10k loan for education and another for about the same for a good reliable vehicle as I'm still working full time. Before you ask provincial/federal/student loans won't apply as I make too much money. 

With the first loan and our other payments our TDSR was looking quite good. (low to mid 20%)

But. Due to my credit and the lack of credit of my fiance I am out of options. The only bad thing reported on my report was a shit credit card. (that was fully paid of 5+ years ago) But the problem is all of our bills right now have not been reporting, other than our cell bills. 

I feel, with the advisement of a new bank that I may be switching to. My best option would be to get a credit card for both me and my fiance and start building that way. Also, if possible get a newer vehicle (if possible) at around 10-15,000 which will allow me to get a 2011 or newer vehicle with low mileage and we would not have to pay tax on that purchase as my fiance is status. Therefore it should book well.

If it matters we're in Canada and have about 7000 in total savings. Not great but something.

Is this the right, best, or only way to go about rebuilding?

Summary: I have shit credit and my fiance has none. Is getting a credit card and possibly an auto loan the best way to (re)build our credit so I can get a loan for education?

personalfinance,Should I pay off student loans or invest elsewhere?,"Hi everyone,

I work sales selling a sort of ""big ticket"" item.  Because of the nature of what we sell, each sale takes about a year of nurturing to close.  I have a base salary which I budget strictly, and on the rare occasions of a sale actually closing I receive a very sizable commission.

Earlier this year I brought in a large contract which has been paying out commission over the past 6 months.  I've been sticking to my normal budget that I created around my base salary and sticking away the commission payments in a savings fund.  I have an emergency fund as well that if need be would sustain me for around 5 months.

gaming,"My ""things you may not have noticed"" for the death straining trailer","So I've made a bit of a ""things you may not have noticed"" about the death stranding trailer. Some are a little obvious but are still noteworthy. 

1. Each trailer has had dead sea life on a muddy surface. However in this trailer the water level also rises. Could the Dead  sea life be because of shifting water levels?

2. The planes flying overhead have (what I am calling) death strands hanging off of them. 

3. All of the military is outfitted in World War Two gear, even though it can be distinguished (through technology and clothing) this takes place in a near future. 

4. When the baby and the older man look together at the camera, the baby only opens its right eye.

5. The baby doll at the end only opens its right eye. 

6. The baby doll seems to have something stapled inside it. 

7. The baby doll is actually DRAGED into that tunnel. (Watch something wrap around its left leg and begin to pull it)

(Theory; Infants are being hunted and these dolls have been used for awhile as decoys). 

8. The military man at the end has his helmet fizzle off. 

9. The military man at the end is the only soldier with modern military gear and weapons. The men with him have M1 rifles and WWII gear. 

 10. The baby doll is blinking red, and when it stops, the soldiers in the background begin blinking red. 

11. And finally, the old man in the beginning is HANDCUFFED. He has one cuff on his right hand, and the other is dangling off. Suggesting that he was cuffed to a post or poll and escaped by breaking the object. (Perhaps caught smuggling and infant or creating one)

Also. One last note about the tidal. 

While there is allot of idea of death strands (the umbilical chord like attachments to the soldiers, the lines coming off the letters of the totals and planes and characters eyes). 

Allow me to introduce the other definition of the the word ""stranding"". 

Verb: drive or leave (a boat, sailor, or sea creature) aground on a shore.

""the ships were stranded in shallow water""

leave (someone) without the means to move from somewhere.

""they were stranded in St. Louis by the blizzard"". 

With all the water in the trailers (sometimes the sea itself) and the main character always on some sort of shore or beach, I can't help that it's not just strands of death, but that death has stranded humanity. To be left ashore on a small island doomed to die (metaphorically).

I've read the credit section of this subreddit but I was hoping I could get some greater insight from you guys since you've been so helpful before.

Discover (Experian): 718

Capital One (TransUnion): 741

To accommodate us, my parents (who felt bad they couldn't help pay for my college) are allowing us to live in a guest house that they recently built - basically a two bedroom apartment. They want us to be able to live there rent free until we're ready to move out. This is a great opportunity for us to pay off student loans, start investing, and save for a down payment on a house.

Our plan:
We are really eager to pay off these loans. The flowchart that is so highly praised here suggests paying off any loans with an interest rate &gt;4%. This makes up about half of the 22k loans that I have.

Should we pay off the loans completely first? Should we put some of the money we're making into saving and some of it into loans?

I also know that I'll be adding worst case 10k in student loans to pay for my credential, I'm currently saving to bring that number down. 

Monthly take home is about $3k, I put away $1500 in savings (I've got a nice 6 month emergency fund and am now just adding to that), about $800 in food/rent/bills, and the leftover $700 or so used to go towards my CC debt but that's all paid off so that's my fun/more towards savings money.

Edit: The Rest of It

If I'm being honest with myself, most months we are in the red.  We spend way too much money on stuff we don't need.  I just don't say no to anyone, myself, my wife, my kids.  So yeah, the guy below who said I knew that this stock bonus was coming so I lived it up was right, that's exactly what I did.  I flat out need to get my financial shit together but have never done it.  My wife wants to move because the schools where we live are crappy, I mean, really crappy which is having an effect on our youngest son (he's in 5th grade).  So, part of me was saving this 50k so we had a way to get out of this house and into another one but I know deep down that that's only going to make matter worse for us.  More mortgage, more expenses.  The Bank of the West loan is a camper that we bought this year, we've gone out half a dozen times since we bought it in September and we have loved every minute of it, we were big tent campers for years.  Both of our cars are paid for but they are old, a 2003 and a 2005 so I know that's coming sooner than later as well.  We have less than 40k in 401k and Retirement accounts, I'm way behind there too.  I'm only contributing 2% at this time.  It's all pretty bad and most of it is behavioral.  I've never been debt free my entire adult life, I'm 47 years old.

Edit 2: Objective Thinking

First off I'd like to thank everyone for the responses.  This has given me an opportunity to think about different approaches to what i'm facing.  When I moved all of these balances around a year or so ago I was drowning in payments.  We refinanced our house and saved about $700 a month (we had 2 mortgages) and then opened additional credit to take advantage of 0% offers.  What I see now is that the piper is coming due.  What I did was start looking at the balance transfer offers in the statements and determining what interest rate I was going to and when it was going to happen.  What I found was eye opening.  The ""ticking timebomb"" comment was the one that really made me think.  ALL of the 0% credit cards are coming up in 2017.  To the tune of $65,665.47 which is actually the lions share of my credit card debt.  This is 15k more than I even have in the bank.  So, here is my plan.  Keep putting as much towards the debt as possible, before each 0% deal expires, take the money out of savings and pay it off, do NOT let it roll to the regular interest rate.  Yes this means the 2 loans will stay where they are but all of the credit cards will be higher if/when they turn to regular rate.  What do you guys think about that plan?",finance,1480707516

I explained to the lady that I was refinancing and that if I needed to make a payment I could, but she told me that it would be fine since the check was in the mail. Fast forward to now and my credit score took a big hit because of a missed payment from them. I called and talked to SunTrust about it but they said there was nothing they could do about it now.

personalfinance,"Just got a $40,000 a year raise, still terrified of money, what's next?","My lovely personal finance gurus and friends… I am hoping you can help me.


My story: I am 29, and just took a promotion for a new role that pays me $95,000 a year before taxes. Prior to this promotion, I was making $55,000 a year, and I have spent the last 5 years of my life rebuilding my credit and paying off debt my exboyfriend left me with 4 years ago. Before I got the promotion, I worked my butt off to pay off the majority of credit card debt I racked up, paid off my car loan 4 months ago, etc. The only debt left I want to tackle the right way is my Student Loan debt, and I want to create a savings plan for myself. My past financial history suggests I am easily tempted, and want to make sure I start this new chapter of my life in the right financial direction. I never want to feel the unhappiness, stress, and darkness that I felt drowning in $20,000 of credit card debt and upside down auto loan debt like I did in the past.


So, now that I got this pretty nice raise, and am in a good financial situation with truly manageable debt, and decreased living expenses, I want to know what I should tackle first, and how. I want to make responsible financial decisions, and not become reckless. Having relatively low monthly bills/expenses compared to my new income is something I really want to take advantage of.


I am currently of the mindset that I want to keep my credit score and health high, as I have worked hard to rebuild this, and would like to keep building it higher. I know I could afford to totally pay off my student loans in a very short timeframe, but I also want to make sure I keep my credit score as healthy as it is now, so I can buy an investment property in the near future. I want to have an emergency fund, be able to go on vacation, buy myself nice things every once in a blue moon, and start investing, but I don’t know where to begin. What are your thoughts/guidance?

personalfinance,Car loan advice? Negative equity + extended warranty.,"Bit (understatement) of a backstory, girlfriend purchased a new car last year and ended up walking out paying 6 grand in extra warranty (yeah, we fucked up). Unfortunately she was in a car accident recently and totalled her car. She had just taken off the replacement insurance a few months prior due to it being too expensive..so after all was said and done she ended up with no car and nice 6700 of negative equity to pay for. After almost 2 months of weighing pros and cons of buying new/used with the negative equity, she is about to walk away with a 2017 elantra..same car she had bought previously only a year newer. The interest is only 1% versus a used vehicle that would have been at least 5.9%, which along with her negative equity would be 3 to 5 grand just in interest and would make the payments quite high due to having to run a shorter term plan. We went to banks and talked about loans and shit there and although she wanted to go cheaper it just didnt seem to make sense with the interest rate. 

Anyways, because of the situation, she now has a ""credit"" on her warranty where she can roll the 8 years over onto the new car at a discount. 2700 for 8 years (160k i beleve...might be 180k) powertrain/engine but can get it for 1800. 
""Appearance"" package is now 815 instead of 1700. And the guy suggests a negative equity coverage for 1600 so this doesnt happen again...even though that coverage still wont cover the full amount. 

Ive done some research and the general consensus seems to be take the money that you would be paying monthly for the warranty and put it in an emergency type fund. That way if nothing happens that money wont go to waste. 

But because of the discount, Im wondering if the 8 year powertrain might not be such a terrible idea. And as far as the negative equity coverage im not really sure what to do there. After what happened before for her I'm super cautious now. 

Basically this is the last day before the deal goes through and just want to make 100% sure we've exhausted all options and this is an ok way to go granted she can make the payments.",finance,1480712009

personalfinance,What are the chances of getting a less-than-total-owed lump sum settlement for a Federal loan?,"Hi all,

My wife is currently in default on nearly $200k in federal student loans.  It's a long and complicated story, and although I know this will likely bring about all kinds of suggestions on how she can get a part-time job and work toward getting out of default and into income-based repayment, please refrain.  We've been there and tried that (she was flat-out lied to by Sallie Mae about process and deadlines) and for a variety of reasons that's just not going to happen now and we've come to terms with that.  She is currently in her early 40s, has zero income, and is a stay-at-home mother of two young children.

She incurred these debts long before we met, and I have spent the past eight years or so further disentangling our finances.  Our cars and house are in my name alone, as are all of the major financial accounts.  My life insurance policy names our sons as the beneficiaries.  We still file our taxes jointly, but if there is any tax return due, I file an injured spouse form to prevent it from being garnished.  We are essentially poised to be able to ride out the remainder of our lives with her having zero financial net worth in her own name, and not a cent that can be taken from her.

Particularly for somebody who is otherwise extremely budget-conscious and responsible with everything she does in life, although she has ostensibly come to terms with this, it's certainly not ideal for the ol' self-esteem.  Although she has told me not to even think about spending my money to pay down her loans, I'm in a position now where I may be able to, and I am seriously considering the positive impact that it may have on her mental health and quality of life as we age.

**My question is this**: at this point, a massive chunk of the debt is accrued interest.  Like 40% of the total owed massive.  Is there any point in me attempting to contact the collections agency and trying to explain the situation and negotiate a lump sum pay-off of say, just the principal owed?  Or even less?  Would they likely respond to a ""well, you can get $100K right now to wipe this debt clean, or likely $0 ever"" ?  Is there precedent for something like this?  I'd rather not even bother getting on their radar for harassing phonecalls in the future if there's zero chance of such a deal being made.

As always, thanks in advance for your insight, pf.",finance,1480712952
personalfinance,Attended ITT Tech. Have some questions about a private student loan.,"OK, so I attended ITT Tech and graduated in 2014.

personalfinance,Parents did not finish taxes on time- possibly more than doubling my personal student debt. What should I do?,"I go to a private university and chose to because they gave me a nice financial aid package; everything was covered and there would be no out of pocket expenses and I was set to graduate with around 26k in debt (22k now due to early graduation!) from only federal loans. My parents did not qualify for the Parent PLUS loan, so they would pay that each semester to compensate. We have had issues with the financial aid office in the past due to late tax transcripts and forms, as well as their own internal issues, but all have been resolved.

I am on top of my financial aid. I forward emails to my mother about the things she needs to complete and I do everything on my own that I have the information for. They claim me as a dependent on their taxes because it is apparently ""a bigger tax break than I would get a refund if you filed by yourself"" which I believe; I work two part-time work study jobs on campus and have taken maximum credits each semester to graduate early. I am not rolling in cash, but I make approx. $800 a month which is enough to cover my personal expenses.

They recently made a lifestyle change. My stepdad is a real estate developer and had a decent payout at the end of 2015 since he gets paid in lump sums. They decided to move across the country and flip houses instead, because he was tired of making housing facilities. It is not going well, and they owe me about 1k for some expenses I helped them pick up. A contractor absolutely screwed them on their first project and they are meeting next Thursday for a resolution that should hopefully give my parents back about 100k of their investment. 

My stepdad does the taxes. He has always filed them very very late, as far as I can tell; 2014's tax transcript got to my university in early 2016, I believe. I have been crystal clear with regards to what I and my university needs from him and by what deadlines, and the consequences of those actions.

I have also been communicating with financial aid and recently, the dean of students, who told me that due to federal law and my fulfillment of degree requirements on December 16th (last day of classes) they cannot accept my tax transcripts if they arrive after Dec 16, and therefore my aid will not apply.

My current balance is 24,847.00. An additional $100 late fee has been added monthly since August or July, I believe, and will continue until there is nothing in the account.

He finished the efiled taxes on Thanksgiving. I presume due to the holiday, that they were registered on Monday by the IRS, so... My question is this;

**How likely is it that their tax transcripts will be available to be sent to my university before December 16th given that they were filed on Thanksgiving?** Efile should take 3 weeks according to my financial aid office. This is cutting it excruciatingly close.

And as a follow-up;

If my parents' late tax transcripts do not arrive in time and my aid does not apply... **How can I begin to take care of this massive additional debt in my name?** I will not have a college degree since I will not have finished paying for it, and the university will withhold my official transcripts. I don't know how this might affect my job prospects. Perhaps it would be possible for my university to take pity on me and waive the $100 monthly interest on the amount. But I have no idea how I'm going to pay this much extra off; my degree is Biological Sciences and I have a good amount of varied work experience, but life science jobs are not well-paying, and I have focused my career towards becoming a zookeeper. 

Should I take out a loan to cover it in order to get my degree? What if the university was willing to waive my late fees? Can I try to take out my student loans in another way?

personalfinance,Need help on making a plan to pay off debt at a young age.,"Hi everyone.
I'm a 23 year old recent college graduate, and I've got some debt that I'd like advice on the best way to go about paying it all off.
Most of the debt stems from me being ""credit card"" happy throughout the past 6 months and buying unnecessary things. Since then, I've learned my lesson, but now I need to do some damage control.


My debt is as follows:


I owe ~$17,000 on a car that I purchased in July, I have no interest for 60 months, so I am making $300 payments and that should be paid off in 60 months.


I owe $6,000 on a credit card, and I have no interest until May 2017. After that, my interest rate on this card will be about 18%. I am making minimum payments on this card.


I owe $1,200 on another credit card with 23% interest rate. Making minimum payments on this card as well.


I owe $1,300 from financing a mattress, again no interest for a year and I'm making $50 payments (I know I need to be paying more).


I have an amazon card with a balance of $600 that I have no interest until November 2017. Should have no problem paying that off before November 2017, so I'm not as concerned about this card.




As you can see, I have quite a bit for a 23 year old, and I'd like to get this under control as soon as possible because my fiance and I would like to get a mortgage in the next few years. My credit score right now is a little over 600.


My main concern are the credit cards because I know the interest rates are pretty high. Should I try to pay off the $1,200 card because I already have a 23% APR and worry about the $6,000 card once the APR starts in May? Do I tackle both at the same time? What should my priorities be?

His wife (my stepmom) died a few years ago, and before she died they spent all the money they had and then some. Some quick figures:

* House is worth ~$800K in northern Virginia (rough estimate, I wouldn't be surprised if it's over $900K).

* He owes $280K in mortgage, and $150K in home equity.

* He purchased it in 1978 for $120K, and has spent $50K in landscaping and $300K in improvements (most of those improvements were a few years ago, hence the large balance on mortgage).

* He gets around $2200 a month in social security. I think his monthly expenses are around $1100 not including his mortgage/home equity payments ($3K or so?)

My figures:

* I had a $60K job as a business analyst last year that I quit because I was miserable. I'm currently working as a professional poker player right now (self-employed), and have made about $140K in the past year from that.

* I got married two months ago. My wife has a $65K job working for the federal government. Her next raise isn't for another 1.5 years (she'll be making a little less than $80K then, I think).

* I have $160K in stocks/mutual funds (maybe a 1/3 - 1/2 is unrealized capital gains), $60K in my retirement account, $15K in bank, and $80K or so in cash.

* My wife and I combined have maybe $20K total in debt, that I've decided not to pay off in full because it's all low-interest (I'd rather keep the money in investments).

- Only debt is on a car, it’ll be paid off in roughly 3 years (about 13k left on a 3.3% interest rate)
- Owns no properties.
- Single, no children
- Company maxes out at 4.5% towards a 401K if I contribute 6% or higher.
- I live in Washington state.
- If I’m buying a condo, mortgage is around $1100/mo.

My situation:

I’ve recently accepted an job that requires me to travel most months out of the year, sometimes internationally, mostly on short notice. At minimum 8 months per year, at maximum 10 months a year. While I’m on the road, all lodging and traveling expenses are paid by the company and I get a per diem for food. I was looking to buy a condo as an asset to hold my money, but after talking it over with friends and family, I’ve been wondering if I should just put the potential payment for a mortgage into my 401k instead, and the down payment on different investments.

I was looking at the $170k-220k range for a condo (hence why the savings didn’t go to the car, I was saving for a 20% down payment). My credit score isn’t terrific, and the bank would only pre-qualify me with a 4% interest rate. Now, I realized that I’ll essentially be paying anywhere from $1000-$1200/mo in mortgage payments to a place that I won’t live in most of the year, and on top of that I’ll have to worry about HOAs, utilities, and whatever other forms of regular payments that will not go towards the equity on my property.

So now I’m Googling different investment ideas and I’m reading through them slowly, and wondering if I’m better off just putting the money into some kind of account(s), and then live in short term rentals (AirBnBs type of places) or hotels for the few weeks/months that I’m “home”. Looking at AirBnB properties within commuting distance to our office that I can immediately move into, I’m looking at $700-800/mo for rent. Also I’m only looking at AirBnB properties with a kitchen so I don’t have to eat out, and whatever other utilities that would save me trips to the laundromat or something.

I would at least do 6% into a 401k to get my employer’s match, regardless of what I do with my living situation. Since there’s a limit on 401k, I’m assuming I should just divide the remaining 50k into different investment accounts right? After maxing out the 18k/year on the 401k of course. Would that be better off than 20% down on say, a $200k condo and then pay payments each month? ($1109 /mo for 15 years) . While I’m at it, should I just clear out the loan on the car?

Goal/purpose: I don’t really know? Originally I was just wanting to put equity into something that will hold/increase in value while I’m working for at least the next 5 years. I figure putting it into a property has got to be better than just a savings account right? At least it’s better than paying rent. I’m not looking to settle down any time soon, but I’m not going to exclude that possibility after 5 years. I’m also not looking to invest more than whatever the 50k + 1100/mo does. 

So should I try to own a property or invest my money?",finance,1480751675

personalfinance,Invest money now?,"Hi all,

Long time reader, first time writer :)

I have a tidy little sum saved for my girls' college and a tidy little sum saved for an emergency fund. I was going to take the bulk of both saving accounts and invest them in something low risk, just so I can have it make some money. I work for the Federal gov't, so my job has historically been pretty stable. My spouse works as a computer programmer, and so far his skills have always been in demand. 

I plan on withdrawing the college money in about ten years (they also have a healthy 529, this is just cash we've been saving for them).

I may also immigrate to Canada in the near future, but that will depend on several factors. 

Anyway, a lot of you are more savvy investors than I am. What do you think? I'm worried that the market isn't going to do well over the next few year, but I don't know.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Anyone know if there are any federal or state agencies that handle complaints about banks/CU/credit protection company incompetence related to identity theft?,"So my friend was recently the victim of some identify theft. Some small loans taken out in his name, checks written/cashed from his accounts, etc. He actually originally caught it before anything could happen, but due to the incompetence of several companies, it happened anyway.

Someone tried opening various accounts in his name that were declined and he caught wind of it. He proceeded to review his credit reports, call the places, and put his credit on lock down.

1. He got an email saying his bank info was changed, so he called them immediately and said it hadn't been changed and that it must have been a mistake. WRONG. It was changed and they then got access to his bank account and wrote a bunch of checks.

2. The CU they tried to take out a loan didn't approve the loan. He called them and told them it was a fraudulent attempt. The scammers then proceeded to try again and use his info to cosign a loan, which the credit union approved. It's mind boggling to me that someone could call and say a loan attempt was fraudulent and then process another loan not long after with that same person's info. The lady in the fraud department started giving him shit and practically accusing him of being part of it. He naturally blew up on her over the phone when she did that.

3. He locked his credit down. They said to unlock it he'll need a PIN which they'll mail to him. He was out of town so didn't even have the PIN himself. The scammers called up and managed to get the lock taken off his credit without the PIN. My friend specifically asked if it was possible for someone to do that and they said no. Guess whining enough is all you need to remove someone's credit lock.

Needless to say, he's jumping through hoops now filing all the police reports etc to get his credit repaired etc. The police did catch the woman trying to cash checks because an intelligent teller in some other city called him and asked if it was a legit check, upon which he told them to call the police. He's tracked some people down on facebook that have all seemingly been related to this and turned the info over to the detective. 

It's mind boggling how ridiculous this all was. I can't comprehend the incompetence of places like the credit company unlocking his account with the PIN or the CU processing a loan even though he had just reported a fraudulent attempt at the same place. It's like none of these institutions have the right security in place.

Is there any agency he can make a formal complaint to regarding this kind of negligence?

I worked at my last job for over 6 years, all which they were matching up to 6% (I believe) to my retirement account to which I contributed 10% every pay period and managed it throughout at a 15% RoR. There were two accounts: 
 
1.) a 401(a) Plan with almost 5K in it
2.) a 403(b) Plan with almost 16K in it

As you can imagine the move, the income reduction, and just live in general (future investments such as a car, graduate school, etc.) are making it very tempting to liquidate this funds and cash out. I am just very unfamiliar with the tax repercussions for it would be, if it'd be worth it, can i cash out a certain amount and reinvest the rest on an IRA/401k, or if I do the full cash out what would be the best investment for the money I dont need right away ( I wouldn't want it to sit idle in a poor RoR savings account).

If there is a tax penalty of 20% or whatever it may be, but during my year of service I am exempt from federal income tax, does the penalty still apply?

What I'm hoping to do moving forward is to refinance/consolidate all of the private loans to reduce those interest rates, they're ridiculous.  I have a quote open with Sofi to refi all private loans into a single 15-year loan at ~6.5% (fixed) or ~5.5% (variable; 1-month LIBOR, up to 9.8%), but haven't signed anything yet because I'm still curious if this could be done better.  Here are some questions I have based on the plan I laid out to pay these down...

* Is it smart to consolidate everything into one loan and deal with it that way or split these into maybe two or even three loans?  I'm unsure if the splitting would reduce the overall amount of interest I'd be paying.
* Should I even bother refinancing those federal loans?  I'm very confident that if I refinance the private loans (and maybe that high stafford loan), I can pay off the three lower stafford loans within a year, probably shorter.
* What are the odds that a bank would offer me rates lower than what Sofi is offering?  I went with Sofi because they're shouting the loudest right now - email, mail, ads, etc.  I planned on visiting some banks this past week, but I got hit really hard with a rough cold and spent most of this week in bed; hopefully plan on on visiting some banks/credit unions this week.",finance,1480788026

The closet is a 1meg block, Segwit is the organizer.  It does not make the closet bigger or hold more,.  It displaces some stuff to another area (the air that was in the closet lets say).  

Now that organizer is a great thing except in this case it's built out of thin cardboard and glue (that isn't even dry yet) and could fall apart at any time.

personalfinance,Repaying an educational loan to a family member.,"Hello personalfinance, I have a question regarding an educational loan I am repaying to my mother.  Here's the back story:

I graduated from a graduate engineering program some time ago with a nominal amount of federal stafford loans to my name.  Nothing crazy, around $20,000 from my entire undergraduate and graduate time.  Shortly after graduating, my mother panicked about the loan interest rate.  She had a personal bad history with loans and desperately did not want to see her children in the same boat.  Honestly, the interest wasn't that bad and I was paying it back at a new job, but she felt a lot more comfortable paying it off herself immediately and having me start paying her back, with no interest, on a monthly basis.  I was not really financially mature enough at the time to argue with her so rolled with it (bad idea, but I was young and new to being mature wit money).  No legal paperwork was written up to show this, other than bank statements and a tally we have between the two of us as to how much I owe her.  
Recently I have looked at changing jobs and snagging a position at a good large company or federal government civil servant spot.  All of the potentials I am looking at have some form of student loan reimbursement program where I can get between 5-10 grand per year addition to my salary to pay off educational loans.  

So my concerns here are twofold:

1)  I have been looking up IRS rules on this recently and am concerned that since she hasn't been charging me interest, this could be deemed by the IRS as ""gifting"" me the interest.  This could leave us open to unforeseen gift tax liabilities in the event of an audit.  I would have no problem going to a lawyer or notary with her to write up official paperwork and terms for this loan if there is any advantage or protection it might give us here.  Suggestions as to an interest rate I could back date to the original loan payment would also be appreciated.  (Again, I have a good job and am paying everything back and could afford interest on the loan, it was her pushing against that entire concept.  I am now concerned about unforeseen liabilities.)  

2)  I would like to investigate getting the loan officially written up as an educational loan with my mother as the owner of the loan.  The proof of change of ownership of the loan would be her bank statements and records showing that she had as a sole actor paid off all the stafford educational loans and taken ownership of that debt herself.  The ideal scenario would be to then tap into the educational loan repayment programs the companies I plan to work for have in order to pay her back faster.  

That at face value though sounds kind of sketch as it leaves open possibilities for abuse.  (Charge an incredibly high interest rate on the loans and then have extra amounts of educational repayment funds channeling from the company/government into my family's coffers.)  

This is all theoretical at this point, and I could use some good solid advice on how to proceed in general.  Thanks for the help averyone and have a good one.",finance,1480791800

We live in California and the houses in our area that would be suitable for a new family range from 200k - 350k.

We have a little over 2k in CC debt to pay back. Once we do my original plan was to pay off my private student loans and then save for a house. My thought process was if we pay off the private student loan now we will have less obligations when we have our own home and thus we will be able to live more comfortable. However I am worried that if I focus on the private student loans that we will not be able to save enough for a decent down payment on a home once my friend retires and sells their current home.

One private loan is 234 a month and the term is four years. I originally borrowed $10,000 and I will pay around $11,232 once the four years is over. The second private loan payment is 39.55 a month. This is an interest only payment on a $10,000 loan. I will also be getting a windfall from some work I did while overseas. Depending on the exchange rate it will be anywhere from 5k to 7k.

personalfinance,"$100,000 end-of-year stock market gamble to offset earned income?","**My Goal:** Take advantage of ability to deduct up to $3,000 of capital loss from ordinary income to offset risks for short-term investment.

**Background:**
I am in the 33% federal income tax bracket
I will likely received $880 in qualified dividends this year
I am not married
Losing (or gaining) $4k or $5k won’t change my quality of life

**Proposal:**
I’m considering taking a gamble by investing $100k in a public company via the stock market under the following three conditions:

*Condition 1:* On the day I buy the stock, I will set a stop-loss order to sell the stock if the value of the stock reduces by $3,880.  $880 will (unfortunately) be used to offset my qualified dividends and (importantly) $3,000 will be used to offset my earned income (33% tax bracket).

*Condition 2:* If the value of the stock is above the initial investment on Dec. 31, I will keep the stock and place a stop-loss order to sell the stock if the value of the stock comes back down to the initial investment.  Thus, I will not have lost any money.  I can then reassess this strategy towards the end of next year.

*Condition 3.* If the value of the stock is below the initial investment on Dec. 31, I will sell the stock.  Up to $880 will (unfortunately) be used to offset my qualified dividends and (importantly) any excess up to $3,000 will be used to offset my earned income (33% tax bracket).


**Worst case scenario**, my loss will be: $3,880 – LongTermCapGainsRate x $880 – EarnedIncomeRate x $3,000. Of course, there is always the chance that the stock plunges during non-trading hours.

**Best case scenario**, I build a billion dollar fortune using $100k.  More realistically, I’ve invest $100k in an “okay” stock that provides returns of 4 to 5%, which may be zeroed out when the stock value fluctuates and triggers the stop-loss order, leaving me back at square one.

**Questions**

1.  Is this a known strategy and I am trying to reinvent the wheel?  If so, please point me to resources that discuss this strategy, whether encouraging or discouraging.

2.  What key factors am I missing?  If this is a stupid strategy, please let me know why.",finance,1480796892

personalfinance,Advice on Negotiating Salary for a Position with no formal experience,"Hey PF, I value the advice and resources from this sub so I'm reaching out to you for some guidance. 

BACKGROUND:

Currently, work in a call center company of about 35k employees as a team supervisor. I'm going on 5 years experience with the company and hold two Bachelor's degrees (Geography BA - emphasis in GIS and History BA). I'm essentially the middle man between Managers and base level phone reps. I have to close (til 9pm at least six nights every month) and work at least one Saturday a month, sometimes two. I have been very successful in my position (averaging anywhere from $60-$65k/yr the last 3 years while peers in my position within the company average &lt;$50-53k on a good year). We do earn commission so only about $37k of my average annual pay is guaranteed. 

I've caught the eye of our Regional VP, gained his favor and have made it known I'm ready to advance within the company to positions that we desperately need. Our center is one of the smaller ones so openings are few and far between. He's told me, as has my Manager, I'm the next in-line for promotion to a Manager position which would move me to salaried pay, a better commission structure and about $10k more annually base pay (~$37k up to ~$47.6k to go north of the recent federal OT law change). The next in-line bit was quoted to me as ""best case scenario within 12 months."" This was ~3 months ago but a position that would be directly beneath him but a step over managers was created within the last 30 days. I applied and was told in my interview with said RVP ""it's unrealistic to make this kind of jump from your current position"" and later in the interview ""it's not going to happen."" He went on to describe the person who would get the role as splitting their current managerial responsibilities and the newly created position. Short and sweet it's a glorified title to give a pay bump to a current Manager (good 'ol boys club). I'm okay with the end result as I knew it was a long shot from jump but it speaks to me that there is a slimmer chance of my ""promised"" promotion in the next 12 months if we are splitting roles rather than specializing.

MAIN CONCERN:

To the main point of this post due to my work ethic and general competence at my job/company I've made connections with other employees at various levels in various departments. One of these people is a Business Analyst (company title but effectively does Application Support for our billing software). They got in touch with me about 30-40 days ago asking if I still had an interest in the IT field. No sooner than they let me know that a current staff member was resigning and they were looking for someone internal from Operations (my department) their direct supervisor, official title is Director of IT, called me directly asking if I was possibly interested in the position and directed me to apply. This was a huge green flag to me because the last time I had spoken with him I could tell it was really a formality for him as I had reached out to him and I wasn't taken seriously due to my credentials. I was professional, thanked him for his time and went on with my current position happily. I received an email shortly after from the Director of IT I applied that they had narrowed down their candidates to a select few and completed pre-interviews via phone with some of the candidates. ""They didn't feel it was necessary to complete one with me"" and asked me to come for an in-person interview. So needless to say I'm excited yet nervous because I feel like they've made up their minds, again good 'ol boys club, that I'm the candidate they want. 

The core issues I'm struggling with is how to negotiate pay and benefits as I have no formal education or IT professional experience. The experience I do have is from my current position and the SQL (main language used on the BA team) class I'm hammering through this weekend thanks to codeacademy. Our company is known for grossly under-paying their employees. Take it with a grain of salt if you will but glassdoor for self provided salaries in the Business Analyst II position Nationwide are $69k, the local average is $63.5k but our company starts at $52.9k (per my HR department). The pay for the new position would be fixed salary which is huge, better hours (no late shifts and minimal weekends) and gets my foot in the door to the IT world, which in my eyes is almost priceless as I can leverage this job for better pay in my next position. I'd also be selling my house and moving my family two hours for this position so that is another concern. My wife and kids wouldn't be able to relocate until after HS is out as my wife is a teacher. So I'm going to be away from my wife and children for the better part of 4 months Monday-Friday which hurts to think about. 

I can't afford to take a pay cut but am afraid the compensation windows are going to be too far apart. I want to ask for the world so that if I gain minimally I'm still winning. I've been referenced by a seasoned colleague to ask for moving expenses (something along the lines $2k), for them to put me up in a hotel/apartment until I find a place and should settle for $65k salary if they offer it (would be essentially no gain in pay other than becoming guaranteed). I've also considered requesting my 401k match to be advanced (currently at 3% and wouldn't get til 5% until my 10th year with the company). I've come to the resolve that I can't use the ""next in-line"" as leverage even though that changes my window of potential earning by +$10k. The BA member that reached out to me originally recommended to use my last 6 months commission to project an offer (this would put my range from $70-75k). This position is the first real ""salary"" negotiation I'll have to do so it's the one that sets the bar for the rest of my career (especially if I can stay in the IT field). Cost of living is higher in the new city by about 3% (per Bankrate/Wolfram). So I'm looking for some help on how to proceed or just general advice. The title for the open position is Business Analyst but I've also seen titles Business System Analyst, the [job description](http://imgur.com/eK4Flvl) matches that of Application Support, they handle IT tickets, etc. 

TL/DR: Looking for advice on negotiating an IT position I have no formal experience/education in. Recruited internally to apply and can't afford to take a pay-cut. 

Income Last 3 Years Average: ~$64k ($37k guaranteed, rest is commission)

Income Last 6 Month Average: $71k (Last 5 is $78k)

Income Last 12 Month Average: $64k

HR entry pay for position is $52.9k

Glassdoor [Pay Ranges](http://imgur.com/0hVZ7BZ)

Given the variety of titles our IT team holds and the pay range should I ask high ~72-78k or would I be shooting myself in the foot?

personalfinance,Questions about repaying private and federal student loans. I'm living with my family for free and making $20/hour full time on a 12 month contract as a programmer.,"I have four higher interest (8-11% interest) loans from SallieMae that have a total principal of ~$22,000. Two of the loans have to be paid off in 60 months, another in 72 months, and the last in 108 months. 

My Stafford loans sum up to ~$42,000. 

I need to start making payments on February 3. 

I started working as an intern/contractor two weeks ago, and the contract term is 12 months. I have to save for taxes. A calculator said about 13.99% of my gross income will go toward federal taxes. The company said they'd like me to work there longer, but I could double my income as an entry level software engineer next year. 

I talked to SallieMae, and they said I can start a graduated payment program. I would be paying ~$250/month for the first 12 months, and then I'd have to pay ~$450/month until individual loans are paid off.  Not using the graduated payment option would mean I would have to pay $406/month.

Should I pay more now or try for graduated payment and PAYE plans? Should I save more money and make minimum payments on loans, or aggressively pay loans without saving as much?

I'm planning to aggressively pay off the highest interest private loans and use a PAYE plan for federal loans while putting ~30-40% of my income in savings. Please let me know if you think there's a better approach. 

I greatly appreciate your input. Thanks for your help.",finance,1480811899

It seems that great lakes, my stafford loaner, will automatically apply whatever my lump sum payment is to the interest amount first and then to my loan with the highest interest rate. My stafford loans are as follows:

Principal |	interest |	rate |        per diem
:--|:--|:--|:--
$3,500.00 |	55.28 |	0.0340 |	$0.33

$2,000.00 |	50.14 |	0.0429 |	$0.24

I've read that the interest capitalizes once the grace period is over, but wouldn't it still be better to put the lump sum (say 2500) towards the higher interest loans rather than the accrued interest on the lower interest loans? I don't see what the point of worrying about paying the interest before it capitalizes if its just gonna end up compounding the same as the future interest on the rest of my balance. 

Also in another 3 months my 11.5k perkins loan will no longer be in the grace period and it has an interest rate of 5%. I should probably just put the lump sum towards that anyway even if it won't gain interest for another 3 months right? The only reason I'm tempted to put my lump sum towards the great lakes loan is because they allow you to pay with a credit card and I could get the benefits and pay it off right away...",finance,1480839034

personalfinance,Can't buy a house - what should I do now?,"I am 30, live and work in London. My salary is £60k ($76k) of which i take home £2800 ($3500) a month. For a while I have been putting £1000 in savings and living off the rest as I was hoping to buy an apartment/house. 


I now have £18k ($23k) saved up in a 2% interest account. The plan was to hit £30k and use that as a deposit on a £200k place. However, I have come to discover that the only £200k places in London and +/- 50 miles are either: 


1) TINY apartments that are hugely overpriced (would be worth £60k elsewhere) 
2) in very high crime ghettos with poor transport at the very edges of London (1.5-2hr journey times into the centre) 
3) very rarely: renovation projects - but the few I've seen required immense work (underpinning etc). I have not yet seen any that require decorating or repair only. I have only seen 3 such properties in 5 years and they were sold in days 
4) on shared ownership for 50% at £200k and huge legal restrictions on selling, renovating/extending and a number of other issues.


I am not willing to settle for any of these types of places - I cannot justify the cost for option 1-3 and option 4) seems like a bad idea legally &amp; financially. As a result I am renting somewhere nice about 20 miles out of London for £850 per month. Transport costs in are £300 per month. It is a nice area but property prices are on par with london (although rental prices are slightly better). In all likelihood I have been priced out of London and I accept that.


I am now at a loss as to what to do with my £18k deposit. Moving out of London is not an option at this point although I would not rule it out within the next 5 years. I have a great matched retirement plan with my job so I am not looking to improve my retirement fund at this point.

The balance on the student loan is about £2.5k and the interest is at 1%. There are no penalties for early repayment on either debt.

I am considering the following uses for the deposit: 

1) sit on it for a while either tied in bonds or other low risk investment - bad idea as the interest would only be marginal. The market is also unlikely to crash so this would not remedy my situation 
2) invest in a buy to let in an area of the country id consider moving to in 5 years - I think this is the best option although I would need a higher deposit of 40-50% (£60k should be fine for outside London). Also to note BTL mortgages have unfavourable interest rates...",finance,1480849385

Two semester's tuition is about $6100.  I work full time which covers all my bills except tuition so I plan on taking whatever loans I need cover that.  That will still leave about $5200 worth of loans per year unused.

I am allowed to request more in loans than I need for tuition to cover other school related expenses such as housing, books, food and transportation.  The money is sent to the school and anything left over is given to me as cash to cover whatever else I have to pay.

Is it worth taking the max I can at this much lower interest rate to pay toward the higher rate student loan?  The way I see it, I'm basically refinancing it to a lower rate.  Plus since it's going to be a federal loan, it will be covered under the benefits of federal loans: income based monthly payments, being forgiven in 10 years no matter what, and if by the long shot they do end up forgiving federal student loan debt in the future, at least part of mine would qualify.

found out my office has partnered with SoFi to offer loan refinancing that comes with $599 offer for signing up.  no origination fees or prepayment penalty, interest rate will be somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5%


my thinking is to refinance, take the $599 and continue paying back as though nothing has changed.


Any downsides that i could be overlooking. only ones i can think of is no longer access to any of the federal forgiveness programs (99% sure will not use any of these) and the short ding to credit from the hard-pull.",finance,1480888974

personalfinance,Repeated attempts to open credit cards in my name after I froze my credit.,"I was over on r/legaladvice and they suggested I post my question over here because you guys are more versed in the way of credit.  

I live in Washington and I'm having repeated attempts of someone trying to open credit accounts in my name.

I work for the federal government and apparently a while back a bunch of personal information was stolen. So they gave all of the employees a credit monitoring service to keep an eye on our credit. Flash forward to about 2 months ago and I get an alert on my credit saying that I had applied for both an Amazon visa card that is held with chase and a discover card.

When I found out I called chase and they closed and canceled the account, and discover didn't actually issue an account because they felt it was fraudulent (go discover!). That night I contacted all 3 credit agencies and froze my credit. I also filed a police report.
Over the last couple months I have received letters from both discover and chase saying they were not able to issue me a line of credit due to a freeze on my credit (go to know that it works), but they keep showing up like someone is continuing to try to get a credit card in my name.

So my questions is, is there anything I can be doing to try to stop these?

Also it's my understanding that even with a frozen credit your credit score can still be effected by reporting creditors, but is my credit being damaged by someone trying to open fraudulent accounts?

Thanks for any advice you have. I consider myself one of the lucky ones that found out at the very beginning and was able to do something to stop it. I can only imagine what would have happened if I hadn't had that credit monitoring service.",finance,1480890163
personalfinance,Refinance online or at the bank?,"Spouse and I bought a used vehicle this May and financed at the dealer.  They gave us a really terrible interest rate (5% on $11k for 5 years).

personalfinance,Purchasing a home; should I finance or pay cash?,"My wife and I recently moved to TN for a new job. Currently renting for $1100/mo and just put an offer on our first home for $140k.

I have a few debts that I have the money to pay off, but don't know if I should because I don't know how it will affect my credit score. I can still save up for a down payment on a house, but don't know if paying off debts on a financing plan early will cause a drop or increase in my credit score. 

I have good credit in the high 700s to low 800s. My fiancé doesn't have much of a credit history so we will probably have to put the house under my name. 

I would like to get rid of the monthly payments so that I have a larger percentage to set aside specifically for the house. Plus I'd just like to be out from under as much as I can. I'll still have school loans, but there is no way I'll have enough to pay those off before the big day. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you. 

Edit: combined we make a approximately 60k a year and have a round 12k between us saved. I can probably have around 10k more saved by June or July, but the house we are looking to buy is only 120k so we would only need around 12k for a down payment.

Including CEOs of mayor mining pools and the members of the Bitcoin Core team. For example, it can force them to make some artful changes in the system, with non-obvious destructive long-term effects.

btc,Theymos secret sauce for bitcoin small block. Spoiler alert: Centralisation and trust everywhere!!,"Theymos:

Yeah, 1MB forever is entirely survivable.

Lightning relies on all participants making a few on-chain transactions every once in a while, so while all current traffic and then some would comfortably work, it wouldn't scale indefinitely on the main chain.
Probably one or more high-volume sidechains would be created for both direct transfers and eventually any Lightning channel-open/close transactions that don't fit on the main chain. There are three types of sidechain that could be used for this:

SPV-security sidechains and drivechains rely on the majority of Bitcoin miners being trustworthy. A majority of miners could steal all BTC on the sidechain. Bitcoin proper doesn't have this flaw. I think that this type of sidechain would only be reasonable for small values: experimentation, microtransactions, etc.

Federated-security sidechains use signing by a group of centralized functionaries instead of mining. If there are many functionaries in many different countries, then IMO this is more secure than the above sidechain types, even though it is technically centralized. It can also have very short times between blocks. This'd be OK for somewhat higher values IMO.

Bitcoin-security sidechains have the same security as Bitcoin, but this requires a softfork in Bitcoin, and then all Bitcoin full nodes must also be full nodes on the sidechain, so maybe this violates your assumption of no successful softforks/hardforks. Though the previously-mentioned sidechain types can usually be converted into Bitcoin-security sidechains at any point after their creation, so this is an especially easy upgrade path: by the time there's a desire to make a sidechain Bitcoin-secure, it'll probably be well-tested and popular.

Alternatively or additionally to sidechains, you could do some of these things:

Blinded bearer certificates allow a bank (which may actually be a multisig arrangement requiring signatures from many independent parties) to issue bearer certificates which can be redeemed for on-chain BTC or transferred to other people. Transferring bearer certificates involves giving the recipient a signed transaction which they then register with the bank to prevent double-spending. Because blind signing is used, this is more anonymous than Bitcoin, Monero, and even Mimblewimble. It is also extremely efficient/scalable. A wallet based on these certificates might ask the user to say something like, ""I trust Bank1 with x BTC, Bank2 with y BTC, etc."", and then the wallet could automatically diversify among certificates issued by these different banks in order to reduce overall risk.
Everyone could open a very-long-lasting payment channel with one hub of their choice, and then there would be a network of long-lasting payment channels between all of the hubs. Transferring BTC to someone would go from you, to your hub, maybe through some intermediate hubs, to the recipient's hub, to them; all through payment channels which probably already exist. There would be only a few main hubs, though the only barrier to creating new hubs would be somewhat higher costs, sort of like how email works. This is called the hub-and-spoke idea, and it results in significantly fewer on-chain transactions than Lightning, which doesn't have hubs.

Before the current incarnation of Ripple, the idea of Ripple was something different. It was sort of like Lightning, but using debt and trust rather than guaranteed payment channels. You would say, ""I'm willing to loan 2 BTC to Alice and Bob"", and then maybe Bob would say ""I'm willing to loan 1 BTC to Carol"". Then if Carol sends 1 BTC to you, this is executed by Bob loaning 1 BTC to Carol and you loaning 1 BTC to Bob, so no on-chain transaction is necessary. Later on, if Bob wants to pay you, you just reduce his debt, again without needing an on-chain transaction. On-chain settlements would occasionally be necessary, but as the trust graph grows they become increasingly rare. If 100% of Bitcoin users used this system and formed a connected trust graph, then I think that no on-chain transactions would be strictly necessary. The main downside of this system is that it is somewhat fragile (ie. if you trust someone incorrectly, then you can lose BTC). (Note that this has very little to do with the design of today's Ripple, whose usage of the name Ripple was a horrible bait-and-switch.)

Now, I don't think that it'd be very good for Bitcoin to be 1MB-forever:

Most of the above solutions have some downside, usually increased centralization. While centralization in upper layers is better than allowing Bitcoin proper to become insecure or centralized, it's still not ideal. Lightning is nice because it combines many of the benefits of these more centralized systems without actually requiring any centralization/trust, but it does require some on-chain transactions. So it'd be really good if Bitcoin can at least handle enough transaction volume for most people to comfortably use Lightning. And in fact I suspect that increasing the max block size to levels required by Lightning will, when necessary, not actually be controversial. (We're not even close to needing this right now.)
Switching from today's Bitcoin to a mostly-settlement-only Bitcoin would be really jarring. There's a lot of distance between where we are now and where we'd need to be in that sort of environment: in wallet design, user expectations/training, the overall ecosystem, etc. If all work on scaling suddenly stopped today, I think that we would quite quickly find the need to make this transition, and most Bitcoiners would find the process to be very uncomfortable.

I'm not sure about this, but I kinda feel that it'd be ideal for people to always be able to do large transactions (&gt;$100 or so) directly on-chain. It'd be like the difference between wire transfers and ACH transfers in the US. Then you can keep most of your BTC directly on the Bitcoin main chain as a sort of ultra-high-security ""Swiss bank account"", and you don't need to rely too much on possibly-less-secure layer-2 solutions.

personalfinance,Did I screw up my taxes?,"So, let me get this out of the way by saying that yes, I should have paid more attention.

Last year I cashed in some old savings bonds that I was given when I was born, about $1300 worth in all. I ended up doing this at 2 banks since one of them had a $1000 limit. The second bank apparently transcribed some of my information wrong - I think they took the social security number on the person who gave me the savings bond instead.

Fast forward to tax time, and I only get one 1099 for the interest I need to pay taxes on. Me being stupid, I just didn't really think much of it. I just received a letter from the bank I cashed the smaller bond at (worth about $300) saying the IRS rejected that TIN and asked me to fill out a W9. Not shocking, given that the purchaser of it is dead. But I think that also means I underreported my interest I earned by a couple hundred dollars.

Is my best course of action to get a 1099 from that bank, fill out the W9, and also amend my 2015 taxes? I'll probably end up owing a small amount back to the Feds, which I'm fine paying.",finance,1480942540

Future Milestones

* Pay off credit card balance by April 2017
* Build Savings/Emergency fund up to $6,000 by December 2017
* Keep checking account balance floating at $2,000 by December 2017
* Allocate $2,000 from yearly bonus to start Roth IRA, and contribute $200/month starting March 2017. Continue yearly for annual contribution of $5400 - $5500 a year 
* Reduce smoking expense to $0. Targeting avg. $40/month spend by January 2017, $30/month by February... etc. 

End Goal: Financial Independence / Early Retirement (at the age of 50-55) 

My Action Plan:

* Once the credit card balance is paid off (targeted for April 2017), allocate the $400/month directly to savings for emergency fund, indefinitely 
* Cut down Entertainment/Misc expenses to an average of $400 a month 
* Once current car lease ends, purchase a used car, putting $5,000 down (funded by bonus payout in March), and finance $10,000 for 48 month term to hopefully keep payments at around $250 maximum. 
* Keep paying minimum amounts on Student loans to prioritize building savings and 401k contributions
* Allocate half of yearly raise to increase 401k contribution. e.g. If the raise is 4%, I will raise my 401k contribution to 12% (Currently at 10%). 


I'd appreciate all constructive criticism, feedback, and general advice in any area of my budget/goals/action plan.


**EDIT - Please see below for an updated Action Plan based on the advice from this thread**

**Milestones**

* Quit smoking as a 2017 resolution to free up ~$50 
* Reduce Entertainment / Misc. spending to average $400 a month
* Build emergency savings to at least $6,000 by December 2017
* Pay off $1,500 credit card balance by February 2017 
* Save $4,000 for a down payment for a car by May 2017 (Total value of ~$12,000)
* Build ""Family Help"" fund of $2,500 by February 2018 for a down payment on a used car (Total value of ~$10,000)


**Action Plan**

* Multiple savings accounts to be created (Car, Emergency Fund, AutoPay Bills/Rent, and Family Help) 
* Keep 401k contributions at 10%. Allocate any increase in salary (typically 3-4%) towards student loans instead of increasing 401k contributions
* Out of the $10,000 bonus I expect in March, 25% will go directly to 401k. I expect to get ~$4,200 after taxes, which will be saved for a down payment for a car for when my current lease ends in May - total value targeting $12,000.00
* Sell company stock/employer match on a quarterly basis. The ~$1,750 that I contributed from my pay over 3 months will be deposited back into my emergency fund. The ~$500 I expect to get back from the employer match will go towards the ""Family Help"" account. At February 2018, when their lease comes to an end, I'm projecting that this account will have ~$2,500 which would be used as a down payment for something like a 2/3 year old Honda Civic ~$10,000 total 
* Cut out at least $100 in Entertainment/Misc. spending and increase the monthly payment towards the credit card balance to $500 to pay off balance by February 2017. 
* After credit card balance is paid off, allocate additional $250 towards student loans, and $250 to building emergency savings up to $9,000 by 2018.

The Wife, 35, 45k a year but she just started as a lawyer and we are hopping she'll make a lot more money in the future but that is certainly not a certaintee.

We used all our RRSP's and TFSA's (20000$) to buy the condo. So now we have :
RRSP 2400$ for me an 800$ for the wife
TFSA 800$ for me.

Here are the debts:

* House 280000$ so 1400$/month
* Student Line of credit 90000$ at 3.6% that we have to pay 887$/month for the next 10 years
* Line of credit 9500$ at 4.8%
* Volt : 446$/month 
* Leaf : 350$/month 
* Credit card 1 : 21000$ at 0% for 9 months
* Credit card 2 : 2000$ at 0% until March
* Credit card 3 : 2500$ at 19.9%

I cannot use any equity on the house as we do not have 20% of value paid. 


So I am wondering if there is something I did not think that can save me some interest and I you were me (well you probably wouldn't have ended in this situation) what would you concentrate on paying first?

personalfinance,Mulitple Mortgages-Additional Payment advice?,"Hi Everyone

My wife and I own three properties and want to put extra money down, to pay our mortgages earlier.

We plan to put $3000 to $6000 aside each year for extra payments.

Should we spread these payments to all three mortgages or concentrate on one?  

All three properties are in Toronto, Canada we have mortgage rates of 2.2 to 2.3 percent.

Our primary residence we owe $275k, and are paying @25 year amortization (~20 years left), 2.3 interest rate.

Condo 1-Rental property we owe $205K, paying @30 year amortization (~28 years left),2.2 interest rate.

Condo 2-Rental property we owe $175K, paying @30 year amortization (~28 years left), 2.2 interest rate.

We plan on keeping the rentals at least 5 more years.

Any strategy here or should we just put everything against our primary residence.

Thanks in advance from the basterd!",finance,1480958629

personalfinance,"Aspirity, Ponzi Scam","So a friend of mine asked me about Aspirity(Link Below) a few weeks ago. At first glance i thought this was very suspect, too high interest. 7-17% for terms 3 months to 5 years and varying investment sizes.

The more I investigated it the more it seems like a Ponzi scheme. The owners have received millions in distributions on their equity that has been mostly funded by the sale of their subordinate notes. The founder and majority shareholder also gets a 20% dividend on preferred equity that only he owns. As well as a salary. Aspirity has been bleeding money and their latest 10-Q shows a significant equity deficit.

I'm kind of convinced that this whole business is a scam that has no intent on paying back the loans just shuffling money to the owners and will allow the company to explode in the next couple of years. They recently upped the interest rates on the notes, which to me implies they are getting desperate.

Does anyone have a take on this that it is not a scam? (By scam i mean little to no chance of getting the money back even if its not illegal) I'm really interested to see if my logic is completely flawed.

If you agree its a scam is there anything that could be done about it? Should this be reported to SEC? Or you think any media company would be willing to cover it? I feel bad that there are people like my friend who might not know better are buying into this.
Thanks

personalfinance,"At rock bottom, Optimism isn't cutting it (Help)","Married high school sweet heart (stupid) wasted student loan money on our 'life' (stupid), divorced.. (not my choice) 60k in student loan debt is currently on forbearance, looming over my head.
I am a salaried employee in the tech field making 55k a year. I make about 2850 a month. I pay roughly 1600 a month on debt (divorce, car loans and credit), bills and rent.

Which leaves me with 700 or so month after Food and Gas.
My roommate is going to prison (stupid) so I have to cover his half of the rent(500.00) soon or find a new roommate. I injured myself last week, some kind of hernia or groin issue and my current insurance doesn't take effect until January 1st. The forbearance is going to run out soon on the aforementioned student loans. They want monthly payments of 500 dollars!!!

So I'm not 'bankrupt' but I have no money for anything. I can't get new shoes or afford to 'live' I just suffer and work and try to push myself to learn new things to somehow make more money.

It's so depressing to see that others get to just live and enjoy their life when everyday for me is a constant reminder of how in debt I am. Especially when I make decent money for a 27 year old single guy. I'm on a good career track to make 80-100k in the next 4-5 years. At this point the depression of being so spread thin while working this job is overwhelming.

If I go to the doctor for my hernia I'll be broke for sure. I've got no savings and no free credit space..
I don't know what to do or where to spend less money at in my life. The constant 'less' and anxiety about it is breaking me. I can't afford to 'be' my thoughts turned suicidal even for a moment. I always thought I was too smart for that but every day is suffering because I'm living in squalor working a good job with no friends and family and no finances to make any.

help. I don't know what I need? optimism is really not getting me along these days. My family was broke and horrible at money so I naturally made their stupid mistakes to learn my own lessons. But I've been learning for 5+ years and I'm very sad now. a broken shadow of the ambition and goals that I had for life.
I don't enjoy any of the seconds that I'm awake. I can't find happiness with others because I'm bitter about how they are not suffering from money but I can't escape it. I'm indentured to the corporate work world and going crazy telling myself 'one more paycheck', 'one more year'. Life keeps fucking everything up by making new things go wrong always depleting me of any funds when I manage to save.

I hate that others are born with money. I hate them on a different level. I don't feel that I am even the same type of man as they are. I can't relate I just seethe at the inequality and the would-have should-have stories that could have been mine if I weren't always paying everybody.
It makes hard to focus when I should be working and hard to relax when the day is over and people should just 'be' relaxed. I'm ratcheted up to a constant worry about finances and this never ending treadmill of trying to be better tomorrow. It's like pushing water up hill. I don't know what to do.
My mental health is deteriorating. by the time i can even get out of debt I'll just be too fucking sad to even know what to do.

23rd 26.00 gym membership


Big ass federal student loans like 55k at varying interest rates currently forebeared until Feb. I've got another year and a half of forbearance to use wisely on them. I was signed up for Income based repayment and the estimated payment was a little over 500 a month so I took forbearance..  

Total of 1,870.00 (as long as I can keep a roommate) before gas, food and dog food (and that nasty federal student loan) 

Averaging around 500 a month on food (groceries, cooking and bumming meals but I do eat healthy)


About 50 on gas and 25 on the dog leaves my monthly expenses at 2,040  Pulling 1480 a paycheck right now so a monthly income of 2,960 leaves me with about 920.00 a month.  I have been spending about 140 or so a month on weed, to handle the anxiety/depression issues. I'm looking for a healthier cheaper way but the struggle is real there.  So about 800.00 a month left over. That's on a perfect peachy month where nothing goes wrong and I do nothing fun, buy nothing for myself or home.


I can't seem to wield it effectively. Last month was fucked because I drove to visit family over thanksgiving. I'm not buying any Christmas presents this year but I'm still planning on going to Christmas so that'll be about 200 in gas.


Every time I break it all down like this I look at the surplus 6-800 a month and think to myself 'where the fuck does it go?'. I will check my withholdings to see if I may be keeping too much from my check. For 2017 my new salary will be 60k a year (5k increase). I've just recently moved diagonally across companies for a raise. I plan to do so again after another year or two here. The tech career path I'm on leads to 80-100k positions.
 

What am I missing here? Obviously I need to track the remaining funds closer. I may be underestimating the costs of food. I might be able to get the internet cable cheaper but I'm tryign to avoid getting locked into another two year contract there.",finance,1480964720

I am now split on where to put my lump sum (~1500) towards because the perkins loan is in grace till 4/1/16 with the first payment due 5/1/16. The loans are:

perkins: 11,500 w/ no interest so far and a rate of 5% (but &gt;3 months longer grace period)

stafford:

The 15 year is attractive because of the shorter term and lower interest rates, but it would make it difficult to save more than around 4-5% for retirement.

I am wondering if it would be better to take out a 30 year mortgage and use the extra $500/month for retirement savings. Even though we would pay a lot more overall in interest, I would assume that my 401k would make up for it over the long term.

personalfinance,(EU) Question with regards to repaying student loans,"Dear r/Personalfinance!

I'm a graduate students from the Netherlands, though I'm studying in Paris for my master's. I currently have around €60k in student debt and I should finish my degree by the summer. By then, I'm expecting to have around €70k in debt. Considering I did a 3-year Bachelor's degree and a master's degree (at a private business school) while living in some of the most expensive cities in the world, I don't feel too bad about having 70k in debt. Moreover, my school is ranked really well so I shouldn't have a problem finding a well-paying job. Okay, enough with the humble-brag, my question now is:

The Dutch government has this great deal for students where you can borrow a certain amount of money each month to pay for your living costs and tuition fees. This is how I borrowed the money and the good thing is, currently the interest rate is 0.0%. You read that right, I'd have to pay 0.0% over the €70k (basically the interest rate follows the European central bank's interest rates I think and since we're currently in a deflationary situation the interest rates are very low). The interest rate is fixed for an amount of 5 years, after which they will revise the interest rates for the next 5 years. In the past, the interest has never been higher than 3%, so it's not as outrageous as in the U.S. for example. Also, I have 15 years to pay it back, so that's around 400 euros per month as a minimum payment. Now my question to you is: should I only pay the minimum payment because the interest is so low and use the rest of my disposable salary to 1) create a sufficient buffer and 2) invest (since I'm only 23 y.o. I'm in a pretty good situation to still use compounded interest to my favor). Or should I pay down more so I get rid of the debt asap (also, bc after 5 years the interest is bound to get higher). 

I'd be grateful for any input!

# Description

Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.The Company operates through four segments: 

* Investment Banking
* Institutional Client Services, i.e. their equities and fixed income trading biz
* Investing &amp; Lending, where they take positions themselves
* Investment Management

So from a financial services perspective, they pretty much do it all, except for offering direct-to-consumer products, though recently they've started to invest in that space.

## Recent financials 

Banks haven't had it easy since the financial crisis. Sob sob. Revenues have been stable, cashflows have been good, but they are still in the process of shrinking their balance sheets and are continually having to boost their equity base. i.e. less assets on the books having to serve a large equity base. Net net, it's hurting the return on equity :(

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $34bn | $35bn | $34bn | $34bn | $29bn|
|EPS | $12.1 | $17.1 | $15.5 | $14.1 | $7.5|
|RoE | 7% | 11%| 11% | 11% | 6%|

And if you look at split in revenue, there is the pure investment banking business which has been averaging at $30bn of sales the last 3 years, and the traditional banking model (interest income &gt; expenses) which has earned $3 to 4bn a year. So you can see that it's the core investment banking business that's key to Goldmans success. 

## Competition

When it comes to the competition they point to a wide range of business models

&gt; Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking, securities and investment management services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and merchant banks. 

But in the US it's the usual suspects that could be classified as the peers. And weirdly, the Return on Equity for GS is bottom of the class. Though it's pretty bunched and you gotta look to the advisory firms, with small balance sheets, to find any high returns businesses. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|
Goldman Sachs Group Inc | $36,369M | 7%
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. | $54,590M  | 10%
Citigroup Inc | $57,540M | 6%
Wells Fargo &amp; Co | $52,248M  | 12%
Bank of America Corp | $50,775M  | 6%
Morgan Stanley | $36,158M  | 7%
Lazard Ltd | $2,283M  | 35%
Evercore Partners Inc. | $1,418M  | 18%

## Cash / Debt?

Well there's really not a lot to say about cash / debt for a bank! That's their whole construct! Instead it's a good idea to work out how much ""assets"" i.e. loans do they have out to clients and what the ""capital"" base is, i.e. equity reserves. As any losses in the loans (""assets"") eat into the capital base (i.e. ""equity""). 

In fact Goldmans has over $500 billion of assets versus it's $70bn of equity. So at a 13% capital ratio, they are one of the better capitalized banks.

Though look at the figures, and marvel. Imagine, they need to have $500bn of ""loans"" out to clients to generate their $34bn of revenues. On this they make $6bn of profit. i.e. $6bn versus the $70bn of equity and $500bn+ of ""assets"".

So shed a tear, go on... it's a tough business to make a return, honest.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $206 target for Goldman Sachs Group Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. Which is odd, since the stock would have to fall 8% to get to their target. 

Wow, imagine the Trump bounce has been especially sweet for investment banks. For most of 2016 GS traded between 10 and 12x earnings, but suddenly it's worth 14x.
 
# Valuation

Though the re-rating's been across the board. Everyone's feeling good about the banks. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/gs/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

C | $159,642M | 12x | 3% | 1% | 4%

LAZ | $5,381M | 14x | -2% | 6% | 15%
EVR | $2,957M | 16x | 7% | 2% | 7%

Sure it's logical, but won't the long-term economics come through...smaller balance sheets, more equity continuing to depress return?

If banks become ""utilities"", boring rent-seekers, like telecoms businesses and utilities shouldn't they be rated that way? For example here's the largest bank v telco v utility in the US.

""Boring Utilities""|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

T | $237,104M | 14x | 9% | 5% | 22%
DUK | $50,582M | 16x | 2% | 5% | 17%

No major shock... except for the crappy dividends the finance utilities pay!

# Dividends

Goldman Sachs Group Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.60 per share, which compares to a forecast EPS of $15.60. On top of that they are allowed to repurchase stock, and they've done a good deal of it, all with the approval of the Federal Reserve.

# Catalysts

In the last 1 month the stock price has moved by 26% that compares with a flat the earnings forecasts. That's against a backdrop of sales off 10% in the first 9 months. 

On to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CFO said

&gt; While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them and they look to navigate these headwinds. 

Which hardly inspires confidence. Especially when he follows it up with

&gt; I would like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment, as well as preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter. 

With the price above the consensus target, management showing little enthusiasm, and no sign of the economics of the investment banking business improving materially any time soon, I can't feel any love for the vampire squid's stock.

Potential new job is a one year position with potential to extend for 4 years. The main draw of this job is the security clearance that comes with it and second is potential to tap into a permanent fed position and explore new aspects of my field.

To beat my current compensation (base plus benefits cash out, $86,150) I'd have to get step 5 pay. However I'm thinking because this is a one year job and I'm giving up a secured job (as far as they know) I'm thinking I should add on another step to my negotiation. 

Should I be asking for more than step 5? How much more can I ask for without spooking them?

What experience can you share about negotiating pay for a federal position? 

I'm not crazy about leaving my current job which is guaranteed for 2 more years for one only guaranteed for 1 year but might make me more employable with the clearance. I've been on the lookout for permanent jobs but nothing so far. 

To mitigate this risk I'm thinking if they at least match my current compensation I'll take it, keep my current job since they're flexible as a part-time (I'll lose the $13k benefits and I'll be super tired for at least a full year) to keep my foot in the door in case the federal job doesn't renew. Both jobs are almost same distance from my home (20 min drive) and are less than 20 min drive away of each other. Does this sound as a decent plan?

*About me;*  
*I am currently unemployed, applying for jobs.  
*I have a business degree, in the process of starting a company, but focusing on a professional career first.  
*Most jobs I seem qualified for/have heard back from are in the $35-$40k range.  
*No big expenses/monthly payments (yet). (i.e. No car/insurance/phone bills (Thanks Mom and Dad!) )  
*I have a decent sum of money saved up, roughly enough to cover half of all my loans.  
*My family is relatively financially stable and supportive, so I am lucky enough to have somewhat of a safety net for food, housing, etc. (Would rather not depend on them, obviously want to become independent)  

&amp;nbsp;

**Plan:** My initial plan is to call and check out if there are any benefits given for paying debts in full for Loans B and D (possibly F) and pay those off ASAP to minimize the interest added. From there, I was going to stay on the standard 10-year plan, while paying extra on loans with a higher monthly payments considering interest rates &amp; higher principal, to again minimize the impact of interest adding up. Currently this order would be(highest monthly interest -&gt; lowest) F, C, A, E, G, then H.

-Note: After reading reviews of Nelnet on BBB and other sites, I am considering recording all calls to/from Nelnet about my loans to ensure they don't try and pull anything, should this help protect me or not? (There's multiple stories of representatives claiming accounts/debts are paid off, then magically they are being charged a larger amount, etc. etc.)

personalfinance,401k cash out and purchasing a home.,"Long time lurker first time poster on this sub.  New user name...because reasons.  I think i know what i am going to get from this sub but i wanted to post anyway to get second opinions.  
I have a 401k from a past job at a large company.  I have 17600.00 currently.  4 family home with 2 young kids.  i am the breadwinner and take in 75k a year.  My spouse works odd jobs and cleans and gets $350 a month under the table.  We have a $19500 in rainy day fund.  With interest rates going up we started the house search.
I locked in a 3.75 interest rate on a 225k loan.  Rates today were 4.25.  At 4.75 my total in the life of the loan increases about 50k.  If i don't touch my 401k I may be looking at 225K at age 65.

So if i cash out i lose my investment in my 401k and the eventual 200k plus that i would get at 65.  But I would secure a home that would start building me capital as well as well as securing a lower interest rate assuming that rates continue to rise.  I know no one knows...but if i did assume that rates would continue to rise would this be completely insane and would you laugh me out of the sub or am i possibly looking at something that makes half way sense.

Owning my own home is a big responsibility and not having that 401k would be a hit but i currently have a new 401k that i have been contributing since Jan.

personalfinance,Pay off student loan debt or continue maxing out retirement savings?,"I am familiar with the guiding principles of this sub: aggressively pay off high interest debt before making contributions above and beyond company match to retirement accounts. However, I'm looking to find out if my debt counts as ""high interest debt"". I've been wracking my brain with this question over the past year or so, and I'd like to get to a satisfying answer.

I am 25 and have about $60K in student loan debt at an average of 6.5ish% interest rate. Currently, I'm making the minimum payments on this while simultaneously maxing out a 401k and Vanguard Roth IRA. 

I believe I could theoretically pay off the student debt in 3ish years if I put everything I could (excluding 6% of my salary to get the full company match) towards it. However, it seems that money I put into those retirement accounts right now will be worth much more than any interest I save by paying off my debt sooner. 

I realize that is not the only factor to consider: getting rid of the inescapable debt hanging over my head sooner rather than later is nice, freeing up the $850 a month I'm throwing at it sooner rather than later would be great, etc. 

I guess I'm looking to be convinced that taking this guaranteed 6.5% return by paying off student debt aggressively is the most fiscally responsible move rather than continuing to max out my retirement accounts, giving that money the longest amount of time to compound. Please correct me if I'm thinking about this incorrectly.",finance,1480983605
MachineLearning,[D] Rot180 in CNNs (for beginners),"# Why

I saw some complicated answers to the following question:

&gt; Why do I need to rotate the filter in the backprop for CNNs?

I'd like to show where the ""rotation"" comes from in a more intuitive way.

# How to ""rotate"" the filter

First of all, note that ""rotating"" a filter by 180 degrees is equivalent to reversing the order of its elements when in vectorized form:

     filter   rotated filter
    
      1234        gfed
      5678        cba9
      9abc        8765
      defg        4321
      
    123456789abcdefg --&gt; gfedcba987654321

# Gradient in MLPs
    
Let's start with normal MLPs (i.e. fully-connected nets).

If

    O = X W           (X = input; O = output; W = weights)

then

    __       __    
    \/_X L = \/_O L  W^T         (L = loss)

# Gradient in CNNs
    
Now let's consider a simple example where the rows of X are vectorized 3x3 images and W represents a convolution with a 2x2 filter.

Let's focus on a single image/row of X:

    image      filter
   
     123        ab       st
     456 (conv) cd    =  uv
     789                 
  
It's easy to see that in matrix form we have

        X          W                   O
   
    123456789   a 0 0 0     1a+2b+4c+5d  2a+3b+5c+6d ...
    2nd image   b a 0 0  =  conv. of second image
    3rd image   0 b 0 0     conv. of third image
    etc...      c 0 a 0     etc...
                d c b a
                0 d 0 b
                0 0 c 0
                0 0 d c
                0 0 0 d
    
For the gradient we need to transpose W:

    __
    \/_O L           W^T
       
     1234      a b 0 c d 0 0 0 0     1a 1b+2a 2b 1c+3a 1d+2c+3b+4a ...
     ....      0 a b 0 c d 0 0 0  =  .......
     ....      0 0 0 a b 0 c d 0     .......
    etc...     0 0 0 0 a b 0 c d     etc...
      
Do you see how the elements of the original filter (abcd) appear in reverse order (dcba)? It turns out that multiplying by W^T is equivalent to performing a convolution with the filter in reverse order (if seen as a vector) or rotated by 180 degrees (if seen like an ""image""):

     d   c
     b  1a  2       = 1a
        3   4       
                    
         d   c       
        1b  2a      = 1b+2a
        3   4
            
             d   c
        1   2b   a  = 2b
        3   4
            
            
     d  1c  2       = 1c+3a
     b  3a  4       
                    
                    
        1d  2c      = 1d+2c+3b+4a
        3b  4a
        
    And so on...

My understanding is if I take out subsidized loans and I decide not to go to grad school, I can just pay the principle back and it will be as if I did nothing.

* Their new website hides several features that are crucial to me, and they will be phasing out the old website shortly (without adding its functionality to the other)

personalfinance,Pay student loans (huge) vs investing,"Hi all, I just started working full time as a new attorney. I make $65k a year pre tax, with bonuses but I'm not sure how large they will be (maybe 3k tops). 

I have 90k in student loans in my name (all fed), and my parents have about 80k in plus loans that I intend to help them pay down. I know, that's a lot, but I can't really do anything about it now except try to figure it out. 

My main concern is whether I should just try to pay down both loans as quickly as possible or take an IBR plan on the loans in my name. my take home each month after taxes, health insurance, and contributing the max my employer matches to 401k is $3,200. Paying what I told my parents I would help with on the plus loans (~$750 month for ten years) and my standard loan amount (10 years at $980 month) together would cost about that much, $1,800. So I have $1,400 left over for housing, car, groceries, etc. which is easy for me because I live in a cheap place/cheap car, etc. 

no credit card debt, car loan has 6k left for 48 months at 3%, no other obligations, single, $3k in savings which is maybe enough to live on for three months. 

Should I try to pay down my loans in ten years? Should I be setting up/contributing to an IRA? I signed up for income based repayment and I qualified for PAYE, so my payments are around $300 for the loans in my name, but plan to just pay the amount I would pay otherwise (the $980), I just figured PAYE would give me some breathing room if things got tight one or two months. Alternatively, I wonder if I should I just pay the minimum on the loans in IBR and put my money into retirement accounts or some other investment vehicle that may be better suited? All of my loans are 5% or higher interest, so it may be hard to beat that return on retirement vehicles or investments.

I don't know what my future job prospects would look like. Hopefully my salary will increase over time as an attorney, but as many of you probably know, the legal market is exceedingly tough right now and if I don't get regular raises it may be hard for me to leave to find better pay. I would love to work for the government or a 501(c)(3) eventually, so who knows if such a job would have a higher salary, but it could open up PSLF down the road.

What exactly are his options?

personalfinance,"[debt] 33K in student loans, expecting 14k more before graduation and need help.","I currently have $18,700 taken out in parent PLUS loans and $14,300 in subsidized/unsubsidized loans. My parents took out the PLUS loan for me to pay off so that I'm able to get the lowest interest rates possible so it's my responsibility to pay it off. (Not legally but we have that mutual understanding) 

I'm a junior at a 4-year university, I expect to be graduating on time in May 2018. My next semester I'll be adding on another 4k to my sub/unsub loans and I expect my last year I'll have another 10k+ to add onto that. So come graduation I'll be around 47K in debt. My current payments are around $200 a month for the PLUS loan. I have $500 to my name right now and will have another payment come December dropping me to $300. 

Here's my current situation. I'm working at a small franchise once a week getting around $8.50 an hour from 5pm-1am that lets me earn just enough to pay off my monthly payment. I'm currently an RA so I get free housing but I also have to buy a meal plan which costs $800 a semester (loans currently pay this). Housing costs average around $550 a month with utilities included for reference. I also work as a brand ambassador doing work whenever they have events which probably earns me around $100 a month on average.

Some important notes:

* I am not a super stellar student, my grades are just under a 3.0 which makes it hard to get scholarships.
* Going off of that I used to work more hours but I was too tired for school and my grades took a hit, so I don't think I can work too much more than I already am without losing what little scholarship I have left.
* I have a long term girlfriend (6 years, I'm 20) that doesn't quite understand the struggle of financing school as her parents pay for her a large chunk of her school. She doesn't want to help me pay off my debt until we get married which is understandable but my financial situation has caused a lot of problems because she doesn't quite get the grip of debt. She's supportive as much as she can be but it weighs heavily on us and I really don't want to sacrifice my commitment to her. 
* I don't have a car and definitely can't see myself being able to afford one anytime soon (Parking costs almost $1000 a year). But it's probably imperative once I graduate.

The little I think I know:

* Pay off the PLUS loan and the unsubsidized loans first.
* Penny pinch wherever possible (meals, free stuff, don't buy what I don't need, etc.)
* Pay a bigger chunk of whatever is due whenever I can.

I'm really not sure where to go from here or how to plan out what I need to do. I've always been so scared to look at the debt that I haven't planned or even *wanted* to plan until now.

I had two credit cards until about 6 years ago. I lost my job and was unable to find work so one card was written off and sent to collections. The other I paid off, but closed the account it shortly after because I didn’t want to dig myself a bigger hole. At the time I didn’t know I should have kept the card to build credit. 


In the summer I spoke with a financial advisor and told him how I used to get harassing calls from the collectors but they gave up because I always ignored them. When I asked if I should pay it off, he said not to because I didn’t admit to the debt and making payments would restart the stature of limitations. However he did say the debt could be sold to another agency at any time and I could randomly start getting calls again.


I’ve graduated from college and am working full-time now, I started paying my student loan on time every month but I still haven’t been able to get a credit card, just got rejected again... I’ve been getting payday loans but the high interest rate makes it near impossible to save. About two months back instead of getting a payday loan from Money Mart, I got an instalment loan that gets deducted from my bank account bi-weekly. I thought paying it off on time could help build my credit but I’m still getting payday loans and feel trapped in a vicious borrowing cycle.

Currently the options that i can see are; using the money to reduce the amount that i have to borrow, investing in the form of a deposit of a house/flat in to stay in while at the uni and taking on housemates for rent in order to help pay for the mortgage (this would be for the second year of uni when i am no longer in halls) or investing in stocks.

personalfinance,Looking for end of year advice for new earner in interesting situation,"I'm 22 years old and I recently started my first real job (I was in college before). Now I need help/advice on how to manage my money and investments. In particular, I'm interested in what end of the year actions I can take that will maximize the financial benefit for me. Here's relevant info:

-I live in the US. 
-I am a full time employee with benefits. 
-My employer does have a 401k but they don't match.
-I don't have a Roth IRA but I plan to get one before the end of the year.
-I don't have any college loans. 
-I don't have very much money saved in the bank now and I estimated that at the end of the year I'll have between $5-6k. 
-My salary is very respectable for a recent college grad but less than 60k.
-Due to some very lucky circumstances and benefits, I don't pay rent, health insurance, or state taxes and spend a very reasonable/small amount on food and transportation costs. This makes my disposable income very high (~75%). 

Although I'll definitely pay a good amount of federal income next year, since I didn't work in 2016 and by the end, I'll have worked less than 2 months, I won't need to pay taxes. I think I'm still gonna file for 2016 so I can get my tax return. But my question is what should I do now, before the end of the year, in terms of investments, shuffling money, anything, that is a smart financial move? Thanks!",finance,1481036282

gaming,Why is there (almost) no friendly fire in recently released games ?,"With the exception of indie games and tactical shooters (like CS:GO, rainbow 6) I can savely say that a vats majority of the games released during the last 24 months have no FF or only a very nerfed version of it.

Games like Titanfall 2, Battlefield 1, Star Wars: Battlefront, Overwatch, Paladins, Battleborn... etc only allow you to hurt yourself but not your teammates (with some small exceptions)

This is does not only apply to shooters but even strategy or RPG games like Tyranny (no FF whatsoever) and Total War: Warhammer (severly nerfed). 

Why leads to people *and AI alike* just spamming their AoE abilities or shooting wildly even with teammates in the line of fire.

Personally I think this is a **regression** in gamedesign!

Of course one can argue that it makes games, multiplayer shooter especially, more accessible but I think that its better to have special ""beginner"" servers with no FF than custom servers where one might enable FF.

Strategy and RPG games should not skimp on FF because, in my opinion, this leads to stupid AI behaviour (as mentioned above). There are noteable exceptions of course, like Pillars Of Eternity. Some FF-limitations for early levels/missions would be much better than have no (or nerfed) FF for the whole game.

Does anyone have more insight on this ?
Was there some big game design conference where they announced that FF was a thing of the past ??",technology,1481038780

personalfinance,Buying a 850K house with 2 other people. Wondering about how to structure the mortgage.,"So my roommates and I are looking at buying a place. The place is 850, but we can probably get it for about 820/825.  

We qualify for over a million dollars, but we don't want to spend anywhere near as much. Location is awesome.  

Our combined incomes are 250K before taxes.  

We can get a little more than 100K for the down payment right now.  Before we close, we would be able to accumulate some more cash in the meantime, which will certainly help.  The way our loans seem to be structured is that we would get 2 loans: 1 loan would cover the 20% down so that we don't have to pay PMI insurance. It looks to be at a higher interest rate (7%) though.  We'd need to put about .5%-1% in escrow for taxes, and then 2.5% closing cost to our realtor.  

We plan on paying that smaller loan off very quickly (1-1.5 years), and then our monthly mortgage would be smaller.  

With the two loans, it looks like we can get away with about 4 thousand a month, plus other expenses (cable/internet, HOA (400), electric, water).  From our finances, it looks like we can swing this. 

The market is only going to be a sellers market even more in a couple months.  We feel this is a good investment.  What are your guys' thoughts?",finance,1481039773

personalfinance,Best Long Term Investment For My Portfolio,"Hello Reddit

I am reading a lot of books on trading, I have absolutely zero knowledge on trading so am learning as I go. I am based in the UK.

However I've come here so will explain my current situation.

I run a online business that is seasonal and a bit volatile. I draw a basic salary but have been trading for 5 years. This is my main income, but I have had some profitable years.

I own three buy to let investments that is producing very good returns on rent with low interest rate. I do all my properties on a fixed interest rate to enjoy the rents.

I plan to own hopefully 10 buy to let investments (not including my own home). I have planned to either draw from my business or remortgage a property thats appreciated significantly into another investment.

I am currently living at home but will be moving out next year into my first residential property.

**So to clarify my business has ups and downs but pays a decent basic wage.**

**My property business is long term. I do not wish to ever sell my properties. I plan to clear my debts in 25 years time aka my mortgages by assuming theyve appreciated and selling a few to pay off the others that are the most valuable at the time and have them mortgage free (if that makes sense).**

So I wanted to asK:

**What is something I can invest say $10,000 a year into for the next 25 years, that will appreciate 8% average, and I can reinvest the 8% back into.**

An idea I came up with was for 25 years buy 25 long term stocks and sit on them, assuming they go up 8% the original few stocks will have almost trebled. By that stage I could sell or even draw a salary from them in my 50s? Im currently 29.

Again i apologize and have no knowledge on trading, and I'd appreciate any information.

Thank you",finance,1481040407

personalfinance,23 year old recent college grad with $0 debt that needs help obtaining their first credit card.,"I would like to get a credit card, but I'm not sure what I should look for or what questions I should ask that would help me start a line of credit. 

A little about me: 
Recent college grad: BS in Economics and Math, June 2016, 23 years old. 

Currently living at home with my parents and job hunting. I am working an internship to gain experience and another part time job that I had through college. 

No student debt or car payments. 
$1000 in checking's and about $2000 in savings. I have my own debit card with a major bank and another with a credit union consigned with my parents that I use rarely  (1/month). 

Spending habits include occasionally eating out and buying a nice pair of jeans or watch (treat yo' self holiday spending). 

I have been reported to a collections agency twice before, but that was due to unpaid bills by past roommates who I had consigned with. All collections agency debts were paid off immediately. 
Lesson Learned: choose better roommates and don't co sign on utilities no matter how ""chill"" you guys are. 

I would like to start small. Use my credit card for simple and regular purchases...gas, food, healthcare payments (yearly checkups, over the counter drug purchases), and occasionally airline tickets. 
My goal is to always pay on time and not incur any interest. 

Where can I check my credit score for free?
What is a good starting line of credit? I'm thinking $1000-$1500. 
What is an interest rate that is too high?
Is there any company or scheme I should outright avoid?
Are there an specific question to ask credit card companies so as to not get duped?

gaming,How POPCAP moved Heaven &amp; Earth to Fix a 6 year old's problem,"This is the story of how a multi-million dollar game developer stopped what it was doing, reached down and fixed a problem for a six year old boy and his dad. It's a story about caring deeply for your player base. It's a story you don't hear very often, and it deserves to be told.

Deep in the Northwestern United States, nestled in the city of Seattle are the headquarters of **POPCAP Games**, makers of *Bejeweled*, *Peggle*, and for the purposes of this story: *Plants vs Zombies*. You may not realize it, but they turned that little mobile app into one hell of a third person shooter franchise when they released *Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare* in 2014, and then *Garden Warfare 2* in 2016. It's *Call of Duty* for kids (and kids at heart), fun factor *nine-thousand*. Our story begins last week, December 2nd, when POPCAP released an upgrade pack for *Garden Warfare 2*: **Festive Edition**.

**Festive Edition** was everything a GW2 player could want for only $9.99. It included 2 new legendary characters, a pack of Christmas customizations, and over 200,000 coins for the player to spend! **But sadly, this tale takes a darker turn...**

You see, somewhere in the Southern United States, in the great state of Texas, there was a little boy. T (we'll call him) who was six, had been introduced to Plants vs Zombies when he was only two, and he had beaten the game only a few months later. He quickly moved on to Plants vs Zombies 2, and then once that was done, Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare arrived. Before long, T had a room full of Plants vs Zombies toys and books, and a bed full of plush zombies. 

Then everything changed. *Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2* was released. More maps, more characters, and a huge private backyard area to adventure in. T and his dad spent hours unlocking items and characters. In particular, T fell in love with the new playable character, **the Imp**. He unlocked all but one of the Imp variants. He begged for bedtime stories told by his stuffed Imp ""Impy"". Then ***POPCAP*** announced the **Festive Edition** upgrade with a new legendary character - **a pirate Imp**.

By the time December 2nd 2016 rolled around, T was talking about nothing else but the new Imp and when the upgrade would go live. **But alas, it was not to be...**

When his dad purchased the upgrade, **nothing happened**. They logged into the game, no new packs, no currency - nothing. They tried everything you can imagine: rebooting the console, unplugging, replugging, refunding and rebuying the upgrade - but nothing worked. Sony could not help them. EA could not help them.

And so, in desperation, T's dad did the only thing left, and reached out to the POPCAP Global Brand Manager, Owen Johnson, and Justin Wiebe, the Marketing Director. He explained how excited his son had been to play Festive Edition, and asked only if there was perhaps someone at the company whose job it was to provide help for issues like this. All he was looking for was a phone number or an email address. But instead, he got much more.

Both Justin and Owen would proceed to personally spend the next 4 days working through this issue with them. 

""*It appears your console isn't communicating with the Sony database that you have the entitlement. Not sure what's going on but we're looking into it.*"" 

""*Sorry for this headache. I'll pass the info along, and thanks for your patience.*""

""*We're connected with Sony and working through it with them*.""

Owen in particular was ***extremely*** hands on, despite having server issues and a myriad of other problems to juggle. Despite all that, they made sure it got fixed.

**Just to be clear**: this was not a 'we're making a patch for this known issue across the board'. In the end, POPCAP ***directly*** modified T's game account to unlock the content he had been waiting for.

This morning, T woke up to find the new content waiting for him, and his excitement at unlocking and playing that Scallywag Imp was something I wish that POPCAP could have seen.

They didn't have to stop and help. They certainly didn't have to personally handle the whole situation from beginning to end, but they did. And if you thought this unbelievable company from Seattle was done there, they weren't:

""*If you'd like to send me your address I'd love to send you and your son a few pvz goodies for helping us out!*""

So from myself and T, **thank you POPCAP!**",technology,1481045317
personalfinance,Question about a page on the subreddit's wiki,"I'm not sure if these are allowed, but I have what I think is a really simple question about the [Debt page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) in the wiki.

When discussing methods of paying off debt, the wiki has the following example, to demonstrate the difference between Snowball Method and Avalanche Method:

&gt; In both cases you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts before choosing which method to devote extra money to. As an example, Debtor Dan has the following situation:

&gt; Loan A: $1100 with a minimum payment of $100/month, 5% interest  
&gt; Loan B: $3300 with a minimum payment of $300/month, 10% interest  
&gt; Sudden windfall: $1300  
&gt; Dan needs to first pay $100 + $300 = $400 to make the minimum payments on loans A and B so the payments are recorded as ""on time."" The extra $900 can either go towards Loan A (smallest balance, snowball method), eliminating it entirely, or Loan B (highest interest rate, avalanche method).  

Either I don't understand loans, or the math in the example is incorrect. How can paying a $100 minimum payment plus a $900 further payment ""entirely eliminate"" an $1100 loan?",finance,1481046303

Yep that's right college kid with a New Car. Long story short got dragged into signing for this new car to help ""build up my credit"" 2 years ago. The lease I signed had absorbed negative equity from my aunt's past leased car which she paid for but I got to use. 


The monthly payments on the car I have is  **$660 a month** The **insurance is $360.** 

I was at the dealership thinking I can't afford this, I could have a fucking BMW for the price of this car. I was reassured that all the payments will be made on time. And I was young and stupid. Me signing this new lease relieved my aunt from her previous debt and I took it over in my payments.. I didn't read the fine print. AND SHE GOT A FUCKING NEW CAR OUT OF THIS.. I felt so used.  

**Current Situation**: I have never reached 90 days delinquent  but have reached 60 plenty of times. Right now it is 30 days behind and will continue to be like that until the lease is up in a year. 


**Credit Card** : I have a $900 credit limit and owe $860. I haven't been late making minimum payments on this but the interest rate is so high its like not even putting a dent into it. I tried to do a credit swap but I was denied.

I was going to a cheap community college and my parents helped me here and there so it lasted me a good while. Now I'm about to move into an apartment, pay will be about $700/month, plus tuition which I'm guessing will be around $6-8000 a semester. Only a couple more years left. I might mention that my car isn't the newest and will probably need to get worked on here and there. I will be making (some) money from work and my parents say they will send me a couple hundred a month for groceries. 

I've heard multiple accounts say that since student loans have such a low interest rate, to take out as much as I can, every time I can. In January when I move I'll be offered around $7,500, then another amount (probably the same) in September. Should I take all of it both times? I'll need money, and I would rather get it at a low interest rate, but I also don't want to get swarmed with debt. Right now I'm only about $3000 in. None of it has to be paid back until I'm out of school though.

personalfinance,Trading in car to get out of high interest payment?,"Good afternoon personal finance, thank you for all your help. After my last post I looked into getting my car refinanced, unfortunately I am still too upside-down on my car in terms of value to refinance it through anyone I have found and at this rate I need to cut my losses on the number of credit checks from trying to pursue that avenue (no place lets you go refinance it when the loan is more than 200%). 

My current idea is that since my credit has improved substantially that I will trade in my car (granted at likely a 5K loss) and carry that burden trade-in to a new car, which I am hoping I will be able to get at 4%.

From my math, I will break even on payments if I keep this number under 20K and get that interest rate.

Is this a valid strategy in my position? And frankly, is it wise? My current car has 90K miles on it and carries around an 11K loan at 17% (my credit was horrible when I got it).

personalfinance,Upside-down on auto loan and $3000 in credit card debt,"I bought my car in December of 2014 for $21,000. $2,000 down out of pocket, the rest was financed at 11.49% ($330/mo). They ran a credit check on me and I was rejected financing because this was my first time ever trying to open a line of credit, so I had no history. So I had one of my parents co-sign. Both my parents had a low credit score at the time due to a bankruptcy, resulting in the high interest rate.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, it was very spur of the moment. My previous car was a hand-me-down 1995 Honda Accord and had gotten stolen that Friday night. So over the weekend I shopped cars and ended up purchasing my first car (2012 Mitsubishi Galant SE) that weekend. I knew when I was buying the car I was paying a bit more than it was worth, on top of that I paid an additional $2,000 for an extended warrenty and to have lo-jack installed (I was very paranoid as I just had my car stolen a few days prior). So I've been paying off the $19,000 loan for 2 years now and still owe $12,000. I just bluebooked the car and found out it only bluebooks at $8,000 in excellent condition. Meaning my loan is upside-down by at LEAST $4,000...

&amp;nbsp;

What options do I have here? The few options I can think of our 1) continue paying off the car (currently at 80,000 miles) for the next 3 years. Then keep the car til it breaks down. 2) I can continue paying it off until I owe less than what it is worth, then trade it in to cancel out my debt. Then purchase a new car at hopefully a much better deal since I have a more established credit. Do I have any other options here that I should consider?

&amp;nbsp;

I make decent money for my age but I'm getting pretty tired of paying $330/mo for my car.

personalfinance,[Maryland] Stock options and taxes,"Hello, 

  I have a few questions regarding taxes and non-statutory stock options. I'm trying to get an understanding of how much cash I need on hand to cover my potential tax burden and the cost to exercise.

  For the sake of the calculation let's say I want to exercise 1000 options which have an exercise price of $0.10 and the fair market value is currently $1.00. 

  The amount of money I need to pay my company would be $100.00 because $0.10 * 1000 = $100. Given the fair market value of $1.00, the amount of money I would be taxed on would be $900. 

  So, for a federal capital gains tax at 15% the amount I would be taxed would be $900 * 0.15 = $135. And, Maryland has a capital gains tax rate of 5.8%. So, the amount there would be $900 * 0.058 = $52.20.
 
 The total tax comes out to $187.20 and the total I need to exercise the options is $100.

Long story short; my wife was a teacher in another state (MD) and had an employer sponsored savings that she, and as a result I, were unaware of. Fast forward a few months, we're in another state and we get a letter saying she can withdraw the 7k and roll it over into another account or keep it. Of course, 20% federal + 10% early distribution taxes knock it down to 4900 if we don't roll it over. :/

Here's some of our personal info:

* Debt:
2 cars, 1) 15k/17k @ 3.99% and another at 19k/27k @3.99
1 personal/home improvement loan for 3k @ 7.99- hoping to pay off in Jan.

* Savings: *Wife does not have any personal IRA/RothIRA accounts
$10k in personal savings
$31k in Government TSP + 600/month

* Total Monthly Expenses:
~4k total (food/rent/gas/utilities/car payments(500/350 per month/leisure money)Everything is slightly over budgeted

* Income:
Wife:3400/month after tax (she also has a new current employer sponsored account that I am aware of this time around. With employee contributions at 10% - but she plans on switching careers after going to school, so we'll likely be doing this sort of thing again in a few years)
Myself: 4300/month post tax and TSP contribution

So... with all this, we still have 3700/month left over. We plan to build our emergency savings to ~15k then call it quits and double down/triple down on the vehicles and then up the TSP.
But what would some of you recommend we do with the 7k? Rollover into a Roth IRA at Vanguard? Elsewhere? Keep it and pay off the personal loan and throw the rest on the 22k car loan? We're both young, and neither of us have invested in personal IRA's/etc..

personalfinance,Being taxed more and more each check. Am I being scammed or am I just uninformed? Please help,"I'm 24, and I know very little about taxes, but this just hasn't made sense to me since the beginning. I've been working for a local  company, getting paid biweekly. My weekly base pay is $500 (we can build our checks with bonuses we earn). My first payment went through a legitimate online payroll service and was taxed properly, I received a digital paystub. Since then, the company has been going outside of the payroll company, paying in cash once and then with physical company checks (loose company checks without the perforated envelope and seemingly without any connection to the payroll company)

My first payment that was direct deposit was for a week of training with no added bonuses. So $500 became $394, which means %.212 was withheld.

Since then, my payments have had unofficial ""paystubs"" (done by hand in MS Word by someone at the office) and I've been taxed at a higher rate each check.

Using the rate I was originally taxed, my next payment ($1175) should have been $926, but I received $880. (that was the time we got cash with no paystub at all)

The next time we got checks. I made $1450 and I received $1049 when it should be $1143 according to that first rate (.212%).

I was on top of them about this and they never said I was wrong in my calculations, and cut me a $140 check for the discrepancies.

But this time, going by the same standard, my check is short $45 and when I went in to talk to my boss, he told me that federal tax fluctuates (???) and that he could give me the $45 now, but it will just come out of my return at the end of the year (or something? I was truly confused and didn't want to argue without being fully informed). I said I'd take the check, and he obliged, but never followed through. I'll be asking him again today, I guess....

What I don't understand is, if that's all true, why is it only going up? I have not entered a new tax bracket. And why didn't they tell me that the last time I chased them down for two weeks to get what I'm owed? (And they paid!)  And why go outside of the payroll company and start issuing unofficial paystubs and checks? Why hand me a round number amount in cash??

All these changes happened right as i arrived, and just before a new crop of recruits came in, and just about all of the original group in my department left. For two weeks they said they were having issues with the payroll company that they will be fixing soon and they apologized etc etc and then they stopped mentioning it, and now it's never brought up. We're promised direct deposit in our contract. The new guys have never gotten direct deposit and didn't even know we went through an ""issue"" with the digital payroll company. I only got paid officially like that the first time. I asked some older employees (before they all left) and they said they've never done this until now.

Does this sound like it's on the up and up? Does the RATE you are taxed at vary like this? I always thought the percentage was fixed. The fact I've been shuffled around by them when asking for help and had to be on them every day to get my money just makes it hard for me to believe a thing they say.",finance,1481118414
personalfinance,CC payoff plan review,"So I take full responsibility for where I find myself. That being said, I'm not here for a lecture so please don't.

I have a high income ($98k gross, bonus eligible, ~$12k from side jobs, etc). However, I find myself $20k in CC debt. 99% bad decisions and poor planning but I am paying hundreds every month in interest. Here is what I have to deal with:

- Chase Bank - $10,234.52 @ 23.24%
- Capital One - $5,384.05 @ 18.15%
- Discover - $4,471.34 @ 0.00% (balance transfer)

Total is $20,359.91

I pay Chase and Capital One once a month, approximately $500. I pay Discover $300 2x/mo which is a little more than I need to in order to pay it off before interest kicks in. I've already cut the cards up so I am not adding to the balances at all.

I checked LendingClub (which I've actually used before as an *investor*) and I qualify for $20k @ 7.49% ($622.04/mo for 36 months). This seems like a no brainer, right? For $22 more than I am paying for just discover, I can get rid of the majority of the interest and be free of this in 3 years.

Upcoming windfalls:

- Approximately $5,200 from the VW diesel buyback. Some time in the next six months but who knows exactly when
- Just under $4k (net) from a contract job I will be completing. Expected in hand in 30-60 days.

I realize my grandma is allowed to take out whatever money she wants, even if it is stupid. This is more of an ethical situation and looking for opinions.

Background: My grandma received a phone call last Thursday stating that this was a California Police Dept. and they had my brother in custody. He needed $9500 for bail money, otherwise he would be held until his court date and be sentenced to a 20 year jail term. My 84 year old grandma fell for it hook, line and sinker. She promptly went to the bank, withdrew $9500, put it in a magazine and stuck in Fedex envelope and sent to PO Box. It wasn't until she saw my brother a few days later that we knew what she had done. The local and San Bruno police department both have detectives on it and are helping us out immensely. 
HOWEVER, this is the ethical part that really has me fired up. When my grandma went into the bank, the bank manager tried to talk her out of it for nearly 30 minutes. Said ""This doesn't sound right, what do you need this money for?, etc"" 
Yet, did not call my mother, who is jointly named on the account, to say your mother is down here trying to drain her savings and it sounds like a scam. The police dept. also commented that it was crazy the bank didn't call them and that they get a call a week from local banks to help assist and prevent these elderly people who are being scammed.
We have called the bank to express our concerns and have been met with ""Then take your money elsewhere. We have no obligation to notify joint account holders of activity. Your mom wasn't very nice to us."" We have taken it to Corporate too and they have assumed a defensive stance.

My mom has set up alerts to notify her if my grandma withdraws anymore than $200. Any other controls or steps you would suggest taking?
We are massively frustrated with the bank's ""oh, well"" stance, this was $9500.

investing,Here's a really excellent read on the thought behind fed policy in the depths of recovery from the GFC.,"Bloomberg - Private 2010 Records Show Dudley’s Staff Urging Bold Fed Action http://bloom.bg/2gBxUbk



&gt;The do-whatever-it-takes attitude of New York Fed staff contrasts sharply with the message the central bank is now getting from House Republicans, who have criticized the unconventional strategies the Fed pursued in the wake of the crisis and would like to see more restraint. Such an all-out approach by staff in late-2010 marked something of an evolution from earlier in the year, when worries about runaway inflation in financial markets from the excess liquidity pumped into the system during the crisis caused them to strike a more cautious tone.


Also 

&gt;In a memo in Dudley’s briefing book, Eggertsson called it “inflation budget accounting.” If a central bank misses its 2 percent inflation target for more than four years -- as the Fed in fact has -- it would commit to keeping an easy policy in place for a longer period of time. At the time, the FOMC hadn’t even disclosed its inflation target to the public, however.

&gt;Eggertsson added that the strategy needed to be followed up with actions. Buying more long-term securities was one way. Another: “Other assets, such as purchases of various private securities could serve the same aim,” Eggertsson wrote.

&gt;The Federal Reserve Act doesn’t permit purchases of securities issued by private corporations for monetary policy operations. “But the staff’s job is to explain the logic of the models and the policy makers have to fit that to the conditions and constraints they face with the law and everything else,” McAndrews said.",finance,1481127756

personalfinance,Where to save down payment: CD or Vanguard?,"Read the sidebar and searched, but couldn't find this exact question posted recently. Edited for formatting.  
  
I have been saving for a down payment and keeping it in a 1% savings account. I am seeking to enhance my return on this pool to keep up with or ideally beat inflation. Whether these savings should be placed in a CD or Vanguard bond index is not apparent. Considerations:  
**1.** Capital preservation might be more important to me than beating inflation for a down payment  
**2.** I do not foresee a *need* to buy a home in the next 5 years (28, gf, no marriage or family plans)  
**3.** I could buy opportunistically when home prices soften and/or once rates lower again (up over the last month)  
**4.** I recognize the hidden costs of homeownership, and there is a high bar for me to purchase a home  
**5.** My 401K and Roth IRA contributions will both be maxed next year and my emergency fund is in place
  
  
I can make a case for either of these options. The CD has a higher rate than savings and an early termination fee, but beats 1% if it's in for 9+ months. Bond funds are unique in that they offer capital *appreciation*, particularly during times of interest rate and home price decreases, exactly when I could see myself buying a house. The downside is taking risk with the savings. Based on this information, I am leaning towards Vanguard. What else should I be considering?",finance,1481128027

personalfinance,"Debt collector called, said I owed almost $1000. I guess my lawyer never updated me. HELP!","Thank you so much in advance! (Some details obscured to preserve anonymity) 

TL;DR: Was stuck with nearly $1000 bill from old apartment complex. Used free student legal help to dispute with pictures, lawyer sent off letter to apartment + never updated us on situation. Now, debt collector is calling and I don't know what to do.

Background: I'm a new grad with a full-time job and my own place. My last year of college I lived in corporate-owned apartments (you know the kind, 30 buildings stuffed with cookie-cutter places), which was fine except for move-in and move-out.

Move in: my roommates and I arrived at our scheduled time (the last move-in time slot of the day) to find our apartment completely trashed. It clearly hadn't been cleaned since the last residents moved out (think finding pill bottles from old residents and toilets caked in INCHES of feces) and they'd also done some construction judging from the tools and sawdust laying everywhere.
Knowing that these types of places can be scummy, I immediately started taking pictures of the entire apartment and encouraged my roommates to do the same. Maintenance people eventually came to remove the tools, at which point they tried to reassure us by saying the furniture and mattresses were brand new (we took the plastic off the sofa and found animal/human hair, coins, and crumbs underneath the cushions). Eventually though, the apartment did get mostly cleaned, and the rest of the year was fine.

Move out (May 2016): A dog in our apartment picked up fleas and after flea bombing several times, everyone just agreed to bite the bullet on letting the apartment charge us for extermination.
Then I got the bill. Nearly 1000$ for ""cleaning and repairing"" our apartment, with the flea extermination only being around $70. The charges included needing to replace the ""new"" sofa as well as painting and cleaning every room. Now, you're going to have to take an internet stranger's word for it when I say the apartment was left in decent condition. It wasn't spotless, but the walls didn't have holes or dirt or even chips in the paint, so I have NO idea why they needed to repaint and wash them (two separate charges). I called to ask and mentioned that I had pictures of when we moved in. I said I was fine with paying for the flea extermination because that was fair. The apartment manager was who I spoke to and she was fairly aggressive and rude, insisting that I had to pay all and that was that.

Naturally, I did what any broke college student would do: I went to my university's free legal help center. They have actual lawyers to help handle these types of disputes. I met with the lawyer, and after seeing the pictures I had he agreed that we should be able to get those charges removed. I sent him all of the info he asked for and then waited for him to copy me in the letter he was sending to the apartment manager.
After two weeks (and a few emails confirming he had everything he needed) he FINALLY sent the two paragraph letter to the complex, assuring me that he'd send me their response.
Another two weeks, nothing. I emailed a few times to ask if there'd been any response, to which he said they hadn't. Out of curiosity, I tried to log onto the apartment's residents' portal to see if my bill had changed, only to find that they'd completely changed the website and my login credentials were no longer valid. Seeing this as a sign of victory, I sat back and assumed the matter complete.

Fast-forward a few months, and I just got a call from a debt collector. He tried to bully me into paying and said photos were never allowed as evidence because you couldn't prove where or when they were taken (???). I remained calm, didn't tell him more than he needed to know, and gave him my attorney's name and phone number. Now I'm sitting here wondering what to do.

Was it my lawyer's responsibility to keep me informed? Will this affect my credit? What should I do?

I got into FIRE earlier this year after reading The Simple Path to Wealth. Really excited as I have always wanted to live a life where I don't have to work if I don't want to but thought the only way to do it was to start a company and makes loads of money.

I have been spending the last 6 months catching up to max out my 401k for this year and making the required monthly payments on my student loans ($585). Starting January, I am trying to figure out whether I should:

* Pay off my student loans first at $2k/month (6% fixed, $46k, Navient)
      1. Payoff Time: 2 years
      2. Max Loan Interest: $4,080
      3. Investments: $0
* Refinance, then pay off student loans first at $2k/month (4.11% variable, $46k, SoFi)
      1. Payoff Time: 2 years
      2. Max Loan Interest: $2,795
      3. Investments: $0
* Refinance, then 50/50 split into loans and index fund (100% into VTSAX)
      1. Payoff Time: 4 years, 2 months
      2. Max Loan Interest: $5,125
      3. Investments: $50,958 (assuming 4% return: $4,996)

&amp;nbsp;

I would still be maxing out my 401k in all three scenarios. Also assuming no raises or major lifestyle changes which would allow me to save more/less.

My two questions are which scenario should I pursue and what is a good interest rate decrease to think about refinancing at? 

I read a lot about 2% for mortgages but couldn't find anything about student loans. Mentally I would feel better to get the loans paid off ASAP and be debt-free but want to know which option would be better in the long run.

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe needed info:


*Age: 29

*Salary: $98k pretax ($50k-$60k post 401k and taxes)

*Loans: $46k at 6% and $5k at 1.5% (not as worried about the $5k loan)

*Credit Cards: Paid off monthly

*Hopeful Retirement Age Range: 40-45 ($600k - $1mil)

personalfinance,I don't understand why 70% of my car payment is going to interest.,"Hey Reddit,

I purchased a new car ~2 months ago (Oct. 19th) with no credit to my name. I paid a down payment of $2.5k and would be making a monthly payment of $371.10. Obviously with no credit I knew the interest would be higher than normal - higher but not unbearable. They told me my first payment would be Dec. 1st of this year. A couple of weeks later, I receive a letter in the mail from the bank that had my account info, APR (9.99%), DPR (.02737%), and next payment info on it. 

Fast forward to today (Dec. 7th). Knowing that I was late to make my payment, I created my account and made my payment at a local branch. I pay $400, sign, and look at my receipt:

Payment: $400.00
Interest: $278.55
Principal: $121.45

I call the loan officer - because there wasn't one at that specific branch - and asked the following questions:

My Q: Is my interest rate this high because I was late?
Her A: It has been two months since you purchased the vehicle and it was late.

My Q: Still seems a bit high for just 2 months, will my monthly payments be that high (edit: I meant the interest with the next payment)?
Her A: Well that's how interest rate works. I can't say what the interest rate will be on the next payment because it varies.

My Q: ...Is there not a way to calculate what my next payment would be because 70% is crazy.
Her A: I couldn't calculate it now. We would have to wait and see what it would be on your next payment in January. 


To be honest, I have no idea how this stuff works and I have been trying to crunch the numbers to figure out what the hell is going on. I have background with student loans (paid off 20k in a year with a 40k job). I make a bit more money now but  I feel like I have gotten myself into a bad situation.

personalfinance,Home Equity Cash Flow - exploring an idea,"I am a mortgage loan officer and I came across an interesting strategy using your equity to pay the mortgage thereby freeing up some/all of your monthly mortgage payment and I am considering doing it myself.  I am easily jazzed up and was looking for some grounding.  

The premise is to cash out some/as much equity from your home.  Put those funds into an account and make automatic payments for a certain amount of time.  Let's say my mortgage payment after I cash out $50K of equity is $800 per month.  That gives me a little over 5 years without a mortgage payment. Let's also assume my mortgage payment before the cash out was $600.  Basically I'm ""saving"" $600 per month.  Now I know I am not really saving it but in essence I've eliminated my mortgage payment for 5 years.  If I saved half of it $300, I would have  saved $18,600.  I could extend the ""no payment"" for another 2.5 years.  7.5 years total.  So that is very attractive to me as we could use some breathing room with our finances.

Now the obvious and biggest con in this situation is that the ""no payment"" would run out eventually and I would need to make the payments out of pocket again.  However, my wife is a stay at home mother to our two children, which the second one will be in kindergarten in two years at which point she will begin working again.  That will be a whole income we have not had for the last six years and we still have 3 to 5.5 years left of ""no payment"".  In addition, I will have established myself as a loan officer and my income will grow significantly even over this first year of 2017.

Other cons are we would have a higher interest rate, but I am not worried about that as it is just a cost of doing business and I would rather enjoy my earnings and equity rather than sending the out of pocket check and the equity just sitting there not doing much of anything.  Plus, if we pay down the principal quickly, once my wife starts working and I make more money; it offsets the higher rate, pays the mortgage off faster, etc.

The value of the house could go down and we would be underwater, but at least we got the equity out and it is not likely to happen as there are brand new homes going up like crazy.

Also, one of us could get sick/hurt but then again, we have the financial flexibility of not making a mortgage payment for a minimum of 5 years.  If the ship hits the sand, we would always sell the home as we would still have equity.

I know there are taxes and insurance to pay as well, I just didn't want to muddy the waters.  Thinking of taking care of those ourselves on the new loan anyways.

personalfinance,What is the best way to take out a loan for home repairs?,"So I've recently decided to do some long needed home repairs which will require I take out a loan, and I want to be as smart as possible with where I get the money. 


Background: I have pretty good credit, about 750 and no other debts except $14,000 left on my student loans. Student loan payment is manageable and luckily all of those have an interest rate below 5%.



I got an estimate and the repairs I'm planning to do will be about $15,000. I'm going to be remodeling parts of my kitchen, which is currently extremely dated and awkwardly laid out so I'm hoping this will increase the value of the house as well as make my day to day life much more enjoyable.

I'm tempted to open a new line of credit with 0% interest for the first year, which I've seen a lot of. A card could have the added benefit of a sign up bonus which I would also like to take advantage of if I can.

personalfinance,"Laid off from my job of 15 years, wanted to check if my plan was financially sound..","So after about 15 years in the oil and gas industry the inevitable finally happened, i'm not trying to be beat up about it, and have been enjoying my time off over the past couple of weeks.

I have revamped my resume, sent it out to many a place and had numerous call backs and a couple of interviews so i'm hopeful a transition to a different industry is not far off.

Anyway, in the mean time i am obviously cutting spending and going to try and let my savings last as long as possible, i have even floated the idea of going back to college to get a degree in computer science or engineering to help my move away from oil and gas.

So i'm battering down the hatches financially and want to see if my plans are sound.


My monthly outgoings (inc. my mortgage payments, food, gas, house bills, car insurance, dog food, pet insurance etc.) are about $2500 per month, majority of that is my mortgage which is $1400 (well, only a fraction of that is mortgage as a hefty chunk of the $1400 is property tax, HOA, house insurance, PMI etc. (PMI drops off next year finally).

I spoke to my mortgage company, surprisingly they were very understanding and said that i can file paperwork to request forbearance every 6 months whilst i'm unemployed, i'm still waiting for the paperwork so hopefully it gets here before my due date next week. 

They said that with forbearance, basically i don't have to pay my mortgage for those months, and that when the forbearance ends those payments will be immediately due - however, at that point i can remortgage (kind of sucks, but not too bad) or i can work out a shortfall payment plan, i.e. if my forbearance amount is 4k, i could pay like 335 bucks a month over a year to get my mortgage back to its current state.

I think forbearance is a good option for the time being as it removes a huge pressure on me financially in the short term.

My wife and i bought a car a few years ago that costs $600 per month (yeah i know.. biggest financial mistake of my life.. young and stupid). i talked the to finance company and im filing a deferment for 1 months installment (they wont allow me anymore  than one month), so i will sell this car in the next month, as long as the loan is covered ill take a bath on the down-payment, lesson learned. The $2500 per month mentioned above does not include this car payment, as the car is going to be gone by the end of month.

Now my credit cards, i have a couple, with about $2,500 outstanding, interest rate is pretty crappy on my Amex card and would cost $40 per month if i paid the minimum (i've always paid it off every month). 

I was thinking just to give myself a little bit of breathing room to open up a balance transfer card (my credit rating is in the high 700s), credit karma says the best one is this Barclays one that charges no fees and has something like 24 month interest free balance transfer. I'm thinking of transferring my outstanding credit card debt to this card and then paying it off over 24 months interest free (about $105 per month).

I think that about covers it, i really just want to make sure i can stretch my money as long as possible should the worst happen.. many people in this industry have been out of work for 12+ months and this city is saturated with unemployed skilled and highly educated people due to the oil down turn, so the market is tough.

I'm not even beyond working in microcenter or best buy in the short time, to be honest id love that just to have a routine back to my life - but with no retail experience, a degree, 15+ years office experience even retail doesn't want to touch me as they don't see me as a good investment of their training/time.

so yeah, please let me know if im missing anything here. I think its a solid plan, to stretch out my savings however i wanted to make sure the bank weren't pulling a fast one regarding the advice on forbearance and that i haven't missed anything.

financialindependence,Making a MAJOR life change. Moving into a 5th-wheel camper for a few years to save money for investments and hopefully retire early.,"Hi everyone!  I just decided to share my plan to live as cheaply as possible for the next 3 to 5 years and save a ton of money while doing so.  I currently have a decent yearly salary at 140k but with student loans, home debt, car debt and lifestyle I was only managing to save 15k per year in a 401k and pay off about 12k per year of debt above min payments. Admittedly I wasn't a great money manager when I graduated from grad school in 2011.  I bought a lot of toys, took trips and ate nearly every meal out at decent restaurants.  Now I'm living with an amazing girl and we decided that we want to maximize our financial potential so we're going to try to live as frugally as possible for the next few years to save money, obtain some cash flowing real estate investments, and learn to live on less than we make.  I recently purchased a used 38 foot Keystone Montana 5th wheel camper which I find to be extremely nice and cozy for about 25k.  We're planning to live free in this ""tiny house"" on my parent's property (they have land and all the utility hook ups required) for a few years and see what we can achieve.  I'm selling my condo FSBO and should clear 25k in equity to start.  Next I'm having a large percentage of my income direct deposited into savings where I can't touch it.  All in I should be able to save 60k per year if I keep my expenses low.  With this cash I plan to try to obtain 3 or 4 multi-family homes which I hope to pay off early and achieve a cash-flow of 4k to 6k per month.   I'm making the move by the end of this month and just wanted to share.  Has anyone else here done anything similar?  Happy Holidays!

**Edit 12/8/16**

Thanks for all the great responses!  A few people made some fairly wild assumptions so I'll clarify my situation and plans so that it makes more sense.  First of all I'm 31 years old, engaged and I really did live my life to the fullest when I was in my 20's.  I truly don't feel that this change will keep me from leading a fulfilling life.  I really need to sell my 2200 sq ft historic condo as it's a lot of maintenance, we have yearly assessments to keep the building structurally sound and it's going to need a new HVAC system before long. I could keep it as a rental but it would likely only cash flow for 100 or 200 dollars per month and I would likely just break even after expenses and maintenance.  My fiance is 100% all in and loves the idea.  My parents live in a beautiful rural area about 20 minutes from where I work in the medical field.  We'll be looking out the window of the camper and seeing woods and water.  I grew up there and love the outdoors so I'm happy about all that I can do there in my free time (hunting, fishing, shooting, campfires etc.) I actually save quite a bit by harvesting my own meat.

I graduated pharmacy school in 2011 with 200k in debt and I'm down to about 65k now.  I'm going to knock this out quickly and after all debt is paid and I can pay cash for rental #1 I'll take advantage of owner occupied financing for #2.   I'll bounce after a year and get #3.  If you finance a rental property without living in it first you get hit with exorbitant interest rates and fees.  Closing costs could be close to 10k and you have to put around 25% down. It makes more financial sense to live in it and then move on.  

My budget won't be horribly restrictive.  I'll be bringing home about 83k annually after all withholdings and 401k.  The other 23k will all go toward student loan debt, food, entertainment and insurance.  My fiance will also be finishing her real estate broker school and wants to rehab and flip some cheap houses along the way.  She will also bring in some income but we don't know how much yet.  

I like the idea of opening a Roth during this process as long as I can still access some of the money for investments. My 401k balance is currently 70k.  I of course won't touch that for about 29 years.  I  also have about 10k in precious metals that I obtained mostly from coin collecting and and coin roll hunting.  I may sell all my junk silver if the market looks better.  

That's my plan in a nutshell.  I know I haven't thought of everything so all input is welcome!",finance,1481167240

I ask because that seems utterly stupid to me if you want to ever have online learning(though maybe I'm too influenced form the reinforcement learning I'm used to).

Whenever there is a new word, you potentially have to retrain your whole model right?

Since then I have racked up around $12k in credit card debt with interest rates ranging from 15% - 23.16%.  I'm sick of living in debt and I just want it to go away. I've started a budget and I'm doing relatively well in sticking to it. I have a decent wage where I'm fortunate to have leftover cash at the end of paying bills each pay period. I put most of my extra funds into savings and I am making aggressive payments towards my CC with the smallest balance (I know I should be putting money towards the card with the higher interest rate but for me, I feel more progress this way for now).

I recently changed jobs and I now have access to my 401K from my previous employer, that totals to roughly 7k.  
Should I put all of my 401k funds to pay off a large chuck of my debt?  What makes the most sense, paying off the smallest balance, the largest, or the one that has the highest interest rate?  Alternatively, should I only withdraw a portion of my 401k so that I have back up savings?

Here are my balances and interest rates if this information helps in giving advice.

$468.10 - 15.15%
$1,070.65 - 23.15%

$3,905.19 - 21.24%

personalfinance,New College Grad needs help budgeting,"Hello /r/personalFinance. I just graduated college and started my new job in a new city. I have A LOT of debt and need advice on how to budget and save for the future. I have it somewhat broken down and am looking for expert advice on what to do 

So my current salary is 66019.20 per year and that's about 1781 roughly for two weeks. I live in CO so state tax is taken out already (I use paycheck calculator to get an idea of what my checks look like).

4. Paypal: $4636 APR 19.9  
5. Amazon: $2331.25 APR 0% for 12 months  
6. Carecredit: $900 APR 0 if I pay off in 4 months  
7. Mattress firm: $1000 APR 0 if paid in 6 months  

Rent: $1300 (this depends too on electricity and gas, depending on how much I use. Rent alone is $1050)

Gas: $20 (I filled up 2 weeks ago for about $20 at $1.87 a gallon. My car is great on gas and I still have half a tank left so it's cheap)

Food: ~$50 - $100 for two weeks (This depends too. I usually buy protein when it's a lower price. So chicken when it's a $1 something a pound, same for veggies)

And that's about it. I calculated it myself and I figure about $800 left per month before saving or anything else...but wanted to get an expert opinion since I am JUST starting off. My company has a 401k and medical but that comes out before taxes so am not sure if you'd need that as well.

personalfinance,Using 401k loan to pay off vehicles?,"Looking at some preliminary numbers and wanted to make sure I didn't miss something. 

My wife's car has about 10k left and my truck has about 8k for a total of 18k owed. Her interest rate is 6% with 4 years left and mine is 3.25% with 2 years left. Total monthly payment for both is 770.

I looked into the terms of a 401k loan and it seemed attractive. I have ~80k available to borrow against. There's a 25 dollar origination fee and the interest rate is 4.5%. Interest pays back into the 401k. Borrowing 18k over 3 years would make the monthly payment ~535. This would free up a couple hundred dollars a month, we'd own both cars and the interest would go back to me instead of the bank. 

I'm aware that taking out 18k would slow down gains for the time being, and that is the part where I'm not sure if this would be better or not.",finance,1481216703
personalfinance,"28yo, -$50K net worth. Considering investing in very generous ESPP instead of paying down student loans. Am I crazy?","Hey all, hoping for some of the solid advice I've seen on this sub. The ""How to handle $"" flowcharts don't address ESPP, and the previous discussions on the sub don't quite align with my personal situation, so here goes:

I'm currently spending $750/mo on minimum student loan payments for a $54,971 principle balance with interest rates ranging from 3%-5.5%. I have the good fortune of budgeting an extra $1,600/mo towards that balance from here on out should I choose to do so. This is due primarily to two factors: a new job and a new outlook on spending. 

However, this new job allows me to enroll in what appears to be an extremely generous ESPP. As long as I do not increase my contribution, I can get a **two year lock-in price** plus a 15% discount. This would begin with 15% off the share price on 01/01/2017. If the stock goes up, I'm purchasing at that price for the next two years. If the stock goes down, I get 15% off the fair market value at the time of purchase (six month buying periods).  There is no mention of a holding period in the overview document, it actually states that shares become available within 1-6 business days.

It's a high-tech company with extremely stable growth and very well positioned for the next couple years (my opinion after several years working in the space). Had I maxed out this plan two years ago and held the stock, I would have an account worth roughly $71,500 on a $42,500 investment over two years.

I know I can't count on stock growth, but I've read the logic in [participating in full and selling immediately](https://thefinancebuff.com/employee-stock-purchase-plan-espp-is.html) in a plan like this regardless of growth, and it seems sound.

However, in order to max out the plan, I need to contribute $1,771/mo in post-tax dollars.

Therein lies the dilemma. Remember my good fortune of paying off my student loans at an additional $1,600/mo clip? Well, I'm considering sticking with the minimum payments and putting that money into the ESPP instead. 

Am I crazy? The flowcharts that this sub promotes say so - paying off debt is always shown several steps in advance of investing. But the returns on this type of ESPP seem to go far beyond negating the sure 3%-5.5% return on paying the loans early. I'm also wrestling with abandoning the plan to get debt free and favoring net worth; becoming debt free has been a primary goal of mine for years, and I've worked hard to get to where I am to afford the option to now do so over the next few years. The idea of bailing on it now is causing me some significant anxiety.

I see three options:

1. Stick with the student loan repayment
2. Invest in the ESPP, selling each batch immediately
3. Invest in the ESPP, holding on to that investment for as long as I have faith in the company's future

The options are to pay monthly until graduation (3.5%, $18k extra), five years (5.5%, $9k extra) or pay in full ($60k). The interest rates and payment amounts actually work for me but there's no way to pay down the principal. It's a fixed number of payments and after the first payment, the same amount is expected until it's paid off.

So I'm leaning towards the one payment of $60k, which I don't have. What I'm looking for is like a mortgage where I have a fixed interest rate and monthly payment with the option to pay down the principal. If I get a loan of any type, I'm confident I can pay it all off in a few years but having an extended time to payoff is a nice luxury.

What would ideally suit this situation? A HELOC? A home equity loan? If I get a home equity loan, will I still have the ability to pay down the principal on my (first) mortgage?

**IRS, Partners Urge Taxpayers to Beware of IRS Impersonations and Tax Scams If you get a call from the “IRS” threatening you with lawsuits or jail unless you pay up immediately … Guess what? It’s a scam.**

IRS impersonation and tax scams by phone, email, postal mail and text are ongoing. Criminals use more and more creative ploys to trick taxpayers and tax preparers. Don’t be a victim. The IRS, state tax agencies and the private-sector tax industry are asking for your help in the effort to combat identity theft and fraudulent returns. Working in partnership with you, we can make a difference. That’s why for the second year in a row, we launched a public awareness campaign that we call “Taxes. Security. Together.” And, we’ve launched a series of security awareness tips that can help protect you from cybercriminals. The IRS doesn't initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text message or social media channels to request personal or financial information. This includes requests for PIN numbers, passwords or similar access information for credit cards, banks or other financial accounts. Here are five things the scammers often do but the IRS will not do. Any one of these five things is a tell-tale sign of a scam.

**The IRS will never:**

* Call to demand immediate payment, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill.

* Demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.

* Require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card.

* Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.

* Threaten to bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.

If you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and asking for money, here’s what you should do:

**If you don’t owe taxes, or have no reason to think that you do:**

* Do not give out any information. Hang up immediately.

* Contact TIGTA to report the call. Use their “IRS Impersonation Scam Reporting” web page. You can also call 800-366-4484.

* Report it to the Federal Trade Commission. Use the “FTC Complaint Assistant” on FTC.gov. Please add ""IRS Telephone Scam"" in the notes.

**If you know you owe, or think you may owe tax:**

* Call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you.

gaming,"Steam refund issue, KOTK Scam, rant inside.","A Friend lured me into buying kotk , i was very weary since all the bad rep for H1Z1 but decided to take the plunge anyway. 

First issue: friend that recommended it was unable to play because of some old H1Z1 account link. Took 1 day to fix. Next i ran into a battle-eye issue that required some cmd line fu to fix, and after that another reboot &amp; reboot of steam + check assets of the game because we were unable to form a team together.

 After two or three game, we realize, this is what i feared it would be a half assed attempt at cashing in on the ""battle/royale/hunger games"" stuff being popular right now. ( all this while H1Z1 is still alpha and this is basically a new mode that they stuffed under a separate game so they could grab some more $$ ) 

In hindsight i should have listened to my first thoughts and never went for it.

 As a 15+years steam user, 100s of games in library, never requested a refund before i was hoping the ""new"" refund system would save me from this bad aftertaste of falling into the H1Z1 money grab. Alas, both my &amp; my friend are now being rejected from a refund for being over the 2hour limit, ( which of course was mostly spend trying to get the game to run in the first place ). 

Is there any way i could get around the automated robot reply ? 
What does it take to get some human on the other side? 
Do i just keep sending the request over &amp; over again ?

My own issues aside. Inst this exactly what steam is supposed to be protecting us against? Im into a lot of eternally alpha games ( rust, ark, space engineers, the forest, i guess you can see the theme ). I think we can all clearly see the difference between a hard working company/ developer going the alpha route &amp; the blatant cash grab i was talking about above. A lot of times i will buy games, not even play them for 2h but still feel satisfied or judge them to be worthy to come back to later, in a later stage of development.


So this hard wall of 2hours does not make any sence at all. ( even less when considering aplha games might take a while and a bug or two to get them up &amp; running properly ).

Hi! 

So I recently got an offer from my bank to open a line of Home Equity Credit with a 2.24% Variable APR (12 months) and 3.855% Variable APR after the introductory Period.

I currently have $64,000 in student loans with Fixed interest rates ranging from 2.65% to 6.8%. I had the idea of taking the loans that have the highest interest rate and using the Equity Credit to pay those off and make payments with a lower interest rate. The Breakdown of the loan amounts and their interest rates are as follows:

16k @ 6.8%

5.5k @ 4.66%

18.4k @ 3.86%

12.4k @ 3.4%

11.6k @ 2.65%

- Annual household income $88,000

- 2 Children (Ages 7.7 and 1.5)

- Equity estimated at $49k

- $11k in Savings

I'm in my mid thirties, I just got married for the first time, and I'm about to buy my first house.

I've wanted to own my own house for a while, but due to some actions I took when I was younger my credit is just not good. Even tho I have put the past behind me I have also taken my time trying to rebuild my credit, which as I get older I'm learning that credit scores are stupid but pretty important in today's society.

So here's the situation; my uncle calls me up and asks if I want to buy a house. He tells me my cousin is getting a new house and he would sell me her house (which he ownes) contract for deed. So I tell him hell yeah.

Now my uncle is a great guy, he's always been there for me, even in my rough days. His whole family treats me very well and always helps me out when I need them, they are great great people who I love very much.

So here's the question, Am I getting a good deal?

I think I am for my situation, so we talked numbers the other day and here is what they are;

He had the house appraised for 69k, he's selling it to me for 55k. (My buddy lives right across the street and he has a comparable house but with lots of upgrades, his house just sold for 90k in one day, just a reference because I plan on remodeling the house)

I think 55k is a great deal for the house, the roof is fairly new, the mechanicals are in great condition as he updated tons of it. Really the only thing that needs done other then cosmetics is for some of the brick to be retuck pointed, which I can do. Also I plan on gutting the 2 bathrooms and doing tile and updating, and I plan on restaining all the trim, which is really pretty. Anyway probably no one is still reading this, so let me wrap it up.


TL DR
My uncle said he would basically sell me the house for 55k, at 5% interest in a 15, 20, or 30 year loan whichever I prefer (I prefer 15 obviously)

He also suggested that I build up my credit so I can get a loan with a bank which would have a better interest rate (he told me my cousin got 3.5% on hers years back)

He also said I could do escrow through him if I wanted to, it was up to me.

While getting my degree I managed to rack up roughly $225K in student debt. Most of that debt was through private lenders ($150K) and the rest through federal gov loans (becoming a pilot is a bitch).   I'm currently in full repayment mode with all loans except one of the private loans where I'm on a ""interest only"" plan for another couple of years. Today I pay a total of $1600/month on student loans and that will jump to about $2200/month once I'm off the interest only plan on one of the private loans. 

Here is where the frustration lies. My wife and I had to file for bankruptcy 2 years ago JUST so I could pay back on my student loans. We both work and bring in a modest income (a little over $70K net), however by the time we pay rent (would love to own a home but my ""mortgage"" goes towards student loans), student loan payments, and regular bills (utilities, no credit cards debt anymore!) we end the month with maybe a couple hundred bucks in our pocket which we try and put into our meager savings account.

But, just wanted to throw it out to the community here to see what ideas all you good people may have to help me pay this debt off faster.

I've also got a modest savings account that has accrued a very small amount but enough that I believe I have to file it.  That said, I need some advice.

Gross Income this year will total to $49,991.35

The following numbers will increase a bit by the end of the year, but here are the YTD totals:

Fed Income Tax Paid - $6,998.38

SS Tax Paid - $2,832.39

Medicare Tax Paid - 662.41

Amount Paid into Roth 401k Mep - $629.65 (matched by employer)

Savings Account - $2,575.85

Interest YTD - $17.07

I do have some credit card debt that I'm slowly but surely paying off.  Don't know if that matters, but I can provide specifics if that has any effect.

personalfinance,How to improve bad credit with no money?,"I'm 28 and I've acquired no credit. Well that's not true. Once when I was 18 I was given a $300 credit card. I was pregnant and broke and I just used it to buy baby stuff. Now 10 years later I've never had anything in my name. 

I don't make a lot of money. I probably make $15,000 a year as a waitress. I'm in school for civil engineering and I hope once I graduate I will make decent money. However I want to build my credit so that when I do have a livable income I'm still unable to get a new car or buy a home.  

I'm pretty responsible with my money. I currently live with my boyfriend who helps me a lot with bills so that I can work part time while I attend school full time. I've considered getting a secure credit card. I'm just wondering how long it would take to see a jump in credit. I'm patient and can wait but I'm wondering if just once secure credit card would do the trick. I know credit history is a big deal and I'm hoping having short credit history will keep my credit from going up. 

I have asked people with good credit history to add me as an authorize user and not give me access to a credit card. I just want credit history but my sons father can't because his good credit is through his family who does not like me. My boyfriend recently saw a huge dip in his credit due to maxing out his credit card in home repairs. He will be able to pay it off in a year but I'm not sure if it will bounce back soon enough. 

I just really want to have decent credit. I'd ideally love great credit but at this point I'd like to be able to actually be approved for a credit card even though I'd probably never take one out or be able to buy a car without high interest rates. 

Any suggestions would be great! Thanks!",finance,1481254806

personalfinance,Should I pay off 6.8% loan or max out roth IRA?,"I graduated college in 2014 with ~$50k in student loans. I've paid $19k so far but have $38k left (original doesn't include interest over 3 years). Here's how they break down by interest rate: 

* $11k at 7.8%
* $15k at 6.8%
* $8k at 3.8%
* $4k at 0%

I plan to pay off the $11k at 7.8% right away (should be paid off by March). 

But my question is, should I put $5500 towards the 6.8% loans or contribute to a roth IRA?

Also, if I were to transfer a former employer 401k (about $3k) to a roth IRA, does that count towards the $5500 annual contribution? so then I could only add $2500 after transferring? 

Thanks for any advice.",finance,1481258681
personalfinance,At what point is making more money not worth it?,"I've worked a supervisor job in retail earning about 32k yr since 2004 when I was going to my undergrad full time. Lifestyle was shitty, as of last year I had no job prospects and was living at home at 30 with no serious career goals, no hopes for having a family etc 

In January Finally mustered enough self confidence (lost a bunch of weight, got a girlfriend, owned my work environment) to land a 40hr week new job working at a finance call center at 35k salary . Reduced hours at the retail job but kept it on for the weekends. Without Pto/holidays, I average 1 day off every 3 weeks.

Didn't realize how brutal call center would be. Constantly screamed at by financial reps and their owners. Literally chained to a desk with a headset, working in a bad department that values all quantitative metrics/fast call times vs quality performance. Toxic auditing of calls is done where  targeting that is likely illegal. The way my dept is set up, everyone is too busy on the phones (40-70 calls a day with 8min average call times) to actually speak to each other so I barely make friends. 

From working desk job I've gained over 40 lbs (I lost 30 prior to getting the job), and sitting at a desk all day leaves me with no motivation for exercise. I've upped my alcohol consumption to deal with the stress, am going through varying bouts of intense depression, had my relationship with my girlfriend fall apart. My free time is spent watching tv and then going to bed for as long as possible before I leave for work. I literally fantasize and joke about killing myself only with the comfort that I'm too scared and lazy to ever try it. 

I've never been better financially (since turning 18) Before I picked up the new job I was 20k CC debt, 20k student loan debt, 1k in savings. I  paid 10k towards debt this year, and with that freedom/refinancing I'm able to comfortably move out of my parents house and will likely be able to come close to that number next year if I continue. 

I hate my life. No free time, no satisfaction, no social life. I attempted reducing hours at call center but they denied the request due to being short staffed. I've now lost my health care at my 1st job due to hours being reduced, completely locked into the new jobs Plan, which is upping a vital prescription to $300 when my copay assistance runs out this month. 

I've been applying to jobs with no luck, but with my worsening self esteem issues and the lack of interview clothes that currently fit my bloated body,  I don't even want to make it to an interview. 

Thinking about quitting in January once I hit my one year anniversary. I'll be able to pick up my previous job and would gain my quality of life back, but would lose out on two incomes and would probably have to pay even more through the nose for an Obamacare plan that would help pay for my expensive/mandatory medication (Google gleevec if your curious)

I wish I never took this job so I could have maintained my lifestyle and health insurance. 

I know this is long. I'm desperate, need to know if I should stick it out or bail. 

TL;DR I was poor and fairly happy, now less poor and miserable. 2016 memes currently true. 

24hr update:

Thanks for the responses everyone. I was raised to never be a quitter and to always stick it out, but this universal consensus made me firm up that I gotta make a move out of this hell hole. If you had to track it all, my situation is like boiling a frog. Here's my breakdown

1) Got the new full time job, began an easy 12 week training program minus the licensing. I was tired from two jobs, but quickly fell in love with the multiple paychecks.

2) Training ends. Get on the floor and the job is horrible, I my goal is to get good enough to evaluate if this job is worth it or not.

3)Realize call center totally not worth it. Realize I cannot have a gap in medical coverage, request to decrease hours to attempt to regain coverage with retail job.

4) Part time Request denied, I become reliant on call center health coverage.

5) If I go back to old job, soonest I would receive insurance coverage would be October.

6) Freak out and post on PF.

I've got to see what my legitimate insurance options are. Apparently I can keep my prescription copay low with a copay coupon, but that's dependent on me being on non-gov't insurance. I have to find out if it works with some private obamacareish plans. Otherwise, I have to summon eye of the tiger and get my shit together for interview enough so that I can find another (hopefully better) job and get their coverage. Also need to balance if I have to let go of my security blanket of a retail job, which will be harder to do now that I have greater financial commitments, but having the weekends off sounds pretty magical right now

Its a bind, but thank you to all that helped clarify my mind. THIS HELPED. PROBABLY.",finance,1481260769
personalfinance,"Am I experiencing wage theft, or am I just missing something?","Hey guys! I'm sorry if this isn't the right place, but I wasn't sure where else to go. 

Lately, I've been concerned about my paychecks I'm getting back. I work minimum wage, so 7.25 an hour. I'm an 18 year old college student with no income beyond this job, so I believe I would be in the lowest tax bracket. My job requires us to clock in, and we get a ticket that shows when we clock in or out.

Lately, my boss has started cashing out checks for us, rather than just paying us with a written check. I thought this might be sketchy, but I let it go. 

What I'm really confused about is this: I just got a written check today for the first time in a while. I have a record that shows that I worked exactly 10 hours this week. My state has no income tax, so I only pay federal. So, I worked 10 hours for 7.25 an hour. If I'm in one of the lowest tax brackets, I would have 15-20% taken out. Or at least I think.

My paycheck for this week was 49 dollars and some change. Does this not add up, or am I simply missing something in my calculations? 

I would really appreciate some help with this, and I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. This whole job has been kind of sketchy from the start, and it's a family run business. 

To;dr  I'm a young student making $7.25 an hour in a state with no income tax. If I only pay federal income tax, and my paycheck was $49 after working 10 hours, where has the rest of my paycheck gone?",finance,1481261465
personalfinance,What's the most effective way to pay off my loans and save simultaneously given that I will likely qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness in 10 yrs?,"I'm in early/mid-20s, just finished graduate school in June, and have been in a secure, decent-paying public sector job with excellent benefits since early October. I live in a relatively expensive city and split rent with my partner. All told, I have $89k in student loan debt that I will start paying off at the end of the month. 

So here's a breakdown of my financial situation:

- ~$3500 in checking. 
- ~$11,500 in a savings account with a 1.05% APY.
- ~$600 in a 401(a) (This is after one month - my gross income is $47.5k; I contribute 5% of my gross income monthly and my employer contributes 10% - pretty good deal)
- ~$2,200 in a Roth IRA.
- Monthly income is ~$3000 (net), expenses will be ~$2,400/month when I start paying off my loans.

In terms of debt, here's how that ~$89k breaks down:

- Two Federal Perkins loans, each with a 5% interest rate, totaling $8,000.
- One Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan with an interest rate of 6.21% on a principal of $20,500, taken out in 2014. I now owe ~$23k.
- Another Direct Unsubsidized with an interest rate of 5.84%, taken out in 2015, same principal as above. I now owe ~$21,600.
- A PLUS loan taken out in 2014 with an interest rate of 7.21%, principal of $23,442. I now owe ~$26,800. 
- Another PLUS loan taken out in 2015 with an interest rate of 6.84%, principal of $8,657. I now owe ~$9,500.

Here's my conundrum: How should I approach loan repayment vs. saving given that I intend to continue working in the public sector for at least the next decade in order to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness? Should I just say ""fuck it"" and make the absolute bare minimum payments toward my loans since the remaining balance will likely be forgiven in 10 years anyway, and just put all of my savings toward retirement/investing? Or should I be more cautious and try to get these loans paid off as quickly as possible, operating under the assumption that PSLF may not exist as a program 10 years from now? How much of my income should I be putting toward retirement vs. loan repayment?",finance,1481262966
personalfinance,How do stocks accumulate compound interest?,"This might sound like a dumb question, but how does an investment into the stock market(s&amp;p 500 for example) give compound interest? Say I buy 10 shares, for 200 dollars a share, thats 2000$. If the stock price raises 10% in a year, I now have 2200 dollars. That is a 10% interest rate, but I still only have 10 shares. Therefore, future returns will only be on those 10 shares, despite gaining 200 year one. It seems like dividend reinvestment doesn't quite matter too much in this, as dividends don't give as much as a yearly gain in stock price.",finance,1481265981

Low risk mutual funds: Highest interest while mitigating some risk

personalfinance,"Wells Fargo ignored my requests to defer student loan payments, and aren't admitting their mistake. Need advice.","I'm not sure if I this belongs here or in r/legaladvice, so if I need to post elsewhere please let me know. Also, sorry in advance for the length.

I left my job in July to move to Germany with my wife so she could get her Masters at a graduate school here. She was accepted in April, and we left the US and arrived in Germany July 28th. Because of the timeframe of her acceptance and the move, I was unable to secure a new job overseas or remotely before we moved. Once we arrived I applied for a German residence visa, which requires I move my money to a German bank account, and provide three month's statements to prove I have enough money to live here.

I have student loans with FedLoan and Wells Fargo, and continued to make payments on both until I needed to transfer money to the German account in October. At that point I still hadn't found work, and so when I reached out to both Wells Fargo and FedLoan to cancel my automatic payments, I also requested to defer payments on both loans while I looked for work. Both requests were sent electronically, as I have a German cell phone and incur large charges if I call abroad. FedLoan responded within 2 business days telling me I was approved for deferment until April 2017.

I received an automated response from Wells Fargo saying to call the number listed for Germany on their International Access Codes page. I tried calling it multiple times, but T-Mobile refused to accept it as valid no matter how I formatted the phone number. I sent Wells Fargo another email letting them know I couldn't successfully call the number listed on the IAC page, and wanted to resolve this via email. I got another automated response identical to the first telling me to call the number listed on the IAC page. Because of the turn around time between emails, a payment due on the 5th of November became past due as a result, and a late fee equal to 21% of the monthly payment was added to my account.

After a back and forth with no results, I looked up a way to make US calls from abroad (Google Hangouts is the best I found), I called their US number and got a representative. She told me that because my payments were past due, I didn't qualify for deferment, and they best Wells Fargo could offer was if I paid off my past due balance and then paid 3 months in advance, they would give me a 2 month forebearance on my loans. I explained the problems I had contacting them, and she saw records of the messages and the timestamps, as well as notes on the account that I wanted to defer payments, but said there was nothing she could do about it.

The other wrinkle in this is when I signed for these loans back in 2010, my father was co-signer on them as well. Between now and then, I've gone no contact with my family for personal reasons. I told the representative I'll do whatever it takes to handle the payment issues myself, and that I'm no longer in contact with the co-signer, but she kept repeating that she would contact the co-signer in 3 business days. I broke off contact with my family at the insistence of my therapist, and having to reach out to them after so long a period of no contact is less than ideal.

So I need to know if there's anything I can do on my end, or any particular department at Wells Fargo I can contact, to sort through this. Thank you for any and all help you can give.

TL;DR: Wells Fargo got my emails asking for deferment, made notes that I wanted to defer loan payments, but didn't do it. Have past due payment as a result, and they want to contact a co-signer I've gone no contact with.",finance,1481304257
economy,Post from r/economics I would like some of the smart people in this sub to comment on,"original post from u/ChickenTitilater

The United States is entering a new monetary era where competition for reserve currency status will result in Fed monetary policy that protects the strength of the dollar and its purchasing power. With the exception of deeper recessions where monetary stimulus is called for, the Federal Reserve is no longer going to be so generous with policy.

The idea that we have been in a ""currency war"" that was a race to the bottom is a pedestrian argument made by people who are trying to lead other people down a particular path. Their drones repeat those arguments bringing others into the sphere of influence of an incorrect thesis. The internet has made it easy to repeat something so much that it becomes believed by many.

The ideology driven thesis that the Fed has somehow destroyed the future of the dollar is a myth. Its actions have led directly to the dollar being so pervasive that it has not only added decades to its life as a reserve currency, but made that life stronger.

The coordinated efforts of the central banks, led by the Fed, have in fact fought off the worst years of the deflationary cycle and prevented an outright depression. The main reason we have seen low interest rates and QE globally is that we have been fighting a deflationary demographic wave in 3 of the 4 largest economies - Europe, China and Japan - that has years to go. [Of the four largest economies, only the United States is neutral demographically.]

It is just simply not true that low interest rates and QE are first about stealing growth from competitor nations. It is about preventing aggregate demand from falling off further and smoothing the path to the ""new normal"" of slower growth forever.

While theorists are postulating a global recession in 2016/2017 - which might be true - will prevent the Fed from raising interest rates, it is not purely on the U.S. to prevent that recession. The Fed raising rates would be seen as a signal that other central banks are now up for fighting deflationary forces and that the Fed is now the last to stimulate rather than the first. That is supportive of a strong dollar which I argue is a primary goal of the Fed now in an era of challenges to the dollar's reserve currency status.

Ultimately, the Fed's job is to maintain the standard of living of Americans. Protecting the dollar is paramount to that end. A firm dollar allows for more lucid economic and financial decision making, as well as, the ability to buy goods and services from abroad.

personalfinance,Life turned upside down. I don't know what to do.,"A month ago I had things together. I was in the army making good money. I owned outright a nice motorcycle ($4.5k), had a nice car (owed ~25k) and was in contract to buy a house at a great interest rate. I was going to college full time at the top of my class. 


About a month ago my motorcycle was stolen and my insurance did not cover it. A few weeks ago, I fell asleep at the wheel and totaled my car. I was also charged with a DUI. I did have insurance on the car but they only paid out 15k leaving me with a 10k difference. I did have GAP insurance but it turns out that was void when I refinanced my loan a few months ago. I had to buy a car so I spent most of my savings on a beater from Craigslist. I also had to buy a lawyer ($1500) which I had to put on a credit card. The army is most likely firing me before my court date so I am also going to be unemployed and have to attend court here in TN in a few months. I know all of these things could have been prevented and are my fault. I just feel so absolutely fucked and I don't know what to do. Should I file bankruptcy? I have good credit at the moment. I am only 20.

I have a PNC cashbuilder visa credit card, so I first called the pnc number and then the visa number. The immediate response from both of the employees was ""PNC does not lower interest rates. If you are interested in applying for a new card, we could discuss rates in that situation.""

personalfinance,Help: bought whole life insurance policy as a retirement investment from NWM,"I really need some help understanding this. I went back and forth at the time but ultimately decided to purchase whole life insurance from an advisor at Northwestern Mutual. Right now I am paying about $6,200/year split across 9 months (I am a seasonal worker and am unemployed 3 months of the year). I do not have a 401k as a seasonal employee and I am maxing out my Roth IRA (I just switched to Vanguard). I am 35  years old and I make ~100K/year. Thus far I have paid about $5,000 into the WL insurance. My reasoning was that I want a long term retirement investment that is not tied to the markets - I don't mind a smaller return in exchange for a guaranteed retirement savings. The policy itself is worth $300,000 and I do not have children. Frankly I don't care about the insurance policy itself. I realize that this may have been poor reasoning, but I need a deeper understanding of why (ELI5 please). If I were to stick with it and not touch it for 30 years, is there any scenario in which this was a smart decision, and if not, how to I get out of it with minimal scathing? 

Edit: I was also looking for a tax-sheltered alternative to a 401K because I don't have one. A little more info: 4.25% is the guaranteed interest rate. The life insurance policy can turn into a guaranteed annuity at age 65 in exchange for the death benefit. I can take up to 92% of the cash value out untaxed leaving the policy in tact. If I closed out the policy, I would only pay taxes on the gains at the capital gains interest rate, no taxes on the money I've put in.",finance,1481327567

I have quite the average scenario but trying to think of ways to make it easier. I wanted to reach out to the community for some advice. With that here it is...

So I have a paid off vehicle worth about 18k trade in. We are in need of a larger vehicle because our family just grew plus one. We also have approximately 20k in accumulated credit card debt at approximately 20+% interest. Payments are relatively lower but we have been paying above the minimum and plan to apply work bonuses to tackle the debt. Credit Score is pretty good. Let's say about $600mo goes to credit cards Now here is my brainstorming idea...

Is it financially better to sell the car, take the cash and apply it to the credit cards, almost paying them off. After paying off the cards finance a new vehicle that not only suits the needs of the family, but has payments around 500 and interest of approximately 3-5%?? 

My thought process was having a car payment that's the same cost of the CCs and a much lower interest rate is financially better than holding the credit debt. We also benefit from a larger vehicle. 

So what say Yee financial experts?!

personalfinance,UPDATE/Resolution Closed my Chase account over the phone. Account balance check lost in the mail. Now they don't know how to issue a new one.,"Previously posted a couple of times regarding this issue and I figured I would update everyone on how it got resolved. TL;DR CFPB helped me get my money back.

Part1: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5civdm/closed_my_chase_account_over_the_phone_account/

Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5efua7/update_closed_my_chase_account_over_the_phone/

I submitted complaints to the CFPB. As soon as I submitted my complaint to the CFPB, Chase became much more interested in getting to the bottom of my issue. I followed /u/ZeneParker's advice and went back to the branch on Monday after I filed my complaint last week. 

The assistant manager and I were able to get someone on the phone right away who was willing to help. Apparently they didn't have a copy of my original affidavit on file (surprise surprise) and the branch didn't retain my original signed copy (surprise surprise). so a check was never sent out (surprise surprise). The copy of the affidavit that they gave me had the notary stamp slightly cut off so they didn't want to take that as proof. They had me sign and notarize another affidavit.

They Fedexed a check to me after they received the new affidavit. Of course, as a final curveball, they tried to send it to the branch instead of to my address, but under my name. Of course, nobody accepted delivery of the check. Thankfully, the driver recognized that they had the wrong address and Fedex let me reroute the check.

So a few takeaways: 

1. Don't trust Chase telephone banking. They are completely incompetent. 

2. Chase Branch Operations and Chase phone operations are completely independent entities that are not even allowed to talk to each other.

3. If your case falls into a weird crack in the bureaucracy like mine, contact the CFPB right away. A complaint with them escalates your issue to someone who can talk to both branches of their business. Demanding to be escalated only gets you to the highest level of that respective branch of the business. If your issue is with 2 different sides of the business talking to either side won't get you anywhere. 

4. Threatening litigation/regulatory action gets you nowhere. File a complaint if you are in the right.

5. Shoutout to /u/ZeneParker. Dude's like the bank whisperer in my book.

I occasionally read through this sub but hardly every post on Reddit. I was dumb when I was a little younger and essentially had two credit cards charged off on my credit report. They are the only things listed as ""negative"" on my Experian credit report, so I want to take care of those. I have a car loan and a student loan that I have never missed a payment on, but the two charge offs are what is ruining my credit. I've read several conflicting answers on what I should do as far as paying back my debt and now I am in a position where I am able to afford paying this debt back.

Between the two credit cards (Discover and the Synchrony Bank Amazon card) I have about $2,000 in debt ($800 on the Discover and $1,200 on the Synchrony Amazon Card). Both of them are listed as charged off, and I have ignored the collections letters for so long that I no longer seem to be getting them. I don't know who I should contact so basically here are my options:

- Call Discover/Synchrony and see if I can make payments in exchange for a removal or changing the charge off to ""Paid"".
- Call Discover/Synchrony to find out who my debt was sold to and pay that collection agency (I have read it is illegal for collection agencies to remove or list debt as paid on a credit report) but I read that that won't change the status of the debt on my credit report. 
- Let the debt expire and be removed after seven years (I am least likely to want to do this because I am looking to help my credit sooner rather than later).

I have read several things that say original creditors are very unlikely to try and help me. It is all very confusing for me because I am hearing several different answers for each problem I have. I spoke to my bank, Navy Federal, and I can get a secured credit card for a minimum of $500 and that will start helping my credit, but I am confused whether I should just use the $500 to pay down the debt or to get the card. Any and all help regarding these situations would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"Tried to buy a used car and felt like I was being taken for a ride on the interest, so I left. Can I even get decent financing with a low income?","I went in to buy a used car today. It would have been my first car purchased. 
I found the car on a used car search website. It was a 2012 Nissan Rogue I liked the price, just under 10,000. The estimated monthly payment, using the websites calculator,  was within what I can afford. So I headed off to test drive the car then the next day to buy it.
My mistake was going to the dealer blind to the process. Before I knew it the finance manager was talking to me about monthly payments and I did not even get to negotiate with the salesman. He already knew my monthly income and asked for my credit score which is just north of 750. He goes on to tell me that because I am a first time buyer my interest rate is going to be at lowest 10% once he runs my credit (he never got to), and before I do that I should get a cosigner and it will probably be 6-8%. Both of these numbers just seemed ridiculously high. He tells me used vehicles always have a higher interest rate, and only new cars have lower rates. In the end I end up walking out of there. There was no way I was going to pay that much more, it far exceeded the budget I set for myself. Also he told me I was wrong in thinking that multiple credit inquiries for a car loan are seen as one if done in a certain time period. Which I just reread and saw that they are. 

So I came to this subreddit in search for advice. I read through some posts and the two success stories in the vehicle wiki (though they are for new cars) but I still have questions. One thing that kept coming up was getting a pre approved (is that right?) loan from a credit union. Someone mentioned DCU.org (Is that for all states? Im in California.) On the used car search website they had a link for getting a loan through a third party. I tried this and apparently I do not make enough money to even apply. I work part time and probably make 13k a year. However I do not have large bills and my rent is low so I know a car payment plus insurance is still within my budget. Will a credit union still even accept an application knowing this? Will I still be able to get a low interest rate? What is a realistic interest rate I should be getting? When I get pre approved will it be anything up to that amount or that set amount? How much more than the car is being sold for should I ask?

So to summarize real quick.

personalfinance,Considering taking out loans up to my ears in order to buy a large property and rent it out through Airbnb,"Hello all,

First, thanks for taking a peek at my query, I hope it's in the right sub. 

So, I was left an apartment after my dad, and I'm in the position of having some capital. Not a lot, but I've been thinking lately about taking out a loan and investing in a large house that is for sale in my city. It is conveniently located near the center, and I believe the previous owner has been using the house in the similar manner - that is to say as a sort of bread and breakfast. 

Anyway, I have about 300 k with my apartment, and would have to get a loan for 500 k in order to buy the house. It is kind of old, and I imagine there would accrue a lot of maintenance in the course of a year, but I have a vague idea that I could restore it to some degree and in the future separate it into three departments, selling them piecemeal. 

It has 10 bedrooms in total, which means that I could offer out 7 while me and my family occupy the remaining 3. At 50 bucks a night, that's potentially 350 bucks a day, and I figure it isn't unrealistic to expect to be able to have 50 % coverage in the course of a month? That'd amount to 5,25 k a month before expenses. 

According to the calculations I did, I'd currently have to spend about 2k a month to cover the loans, though it could rise to nearly 4k if times get tough (that's with a 8 % interest rate, which would be the equivalent to a housing armageddon in my country)

The good news is that my city is experiencing an unprecedented tourism boom, and especially asians seem to be flocking here. With the increase in prosperity in that region, I hope to have a steady stream of clients in the coming years. 

Long term I'd like to make this my full time gig, because I hate my job, but I'm prepared to have to work harder than ever for the foreseeable future. 

I have a niggling feeling that I'm forgetting something important, though. Like, can it be this easy? Of course, maintenance costs could suddenly skyrocket with an old house like this, or business might slow down, or any number of other things. But even in the event that the interest rate goes up to the dreaded 8 %, and if business slows down to the point where I'm only pulling 4k a month (about 40% coverage), I'd still manage to keep my head above water. Or no? 

What do you guys think?

The monthly payments are 1250, and we currently make 1400 in payments every month, the extra going to principal.  We now owe 170k on this house. Due to the improvements that I have made (huge backyard renovation, wiring for data, energy saving things like new insulation under house) and the amazing sellers market in our area we estimate the value of our house to be 325k. Making our equity 155k.


Our house has 3 bedrooms and is in a nice neighborhood. I work from home and need one of the bedrooms for an office. We just had our first baby and hope to have another, which is why we are looking (very lackadaisically) for a 4 Bed house.


We bought a new truck in 2015 and have been making double payments (totally 900$ a month) on it since we bought it. At this rate it will be paid off in June and we will have that 900$ a month back. Even with the 1400 + 900 = 2300$ a month big payments we still have enough income to live comfortably and save for things like retirement and kid's college. 


I kinda like this house and apart from having two kids share a bedroom while growing up, we both believe we could be very comfortable in it for the rest of our lives.

After fees and taxes we would have about 125K-130K to put down on the new house. That's roughly 30% down and would bring our monthly payments on the new house to about 1860$ after factoring in property taxes and assuming an interest rate that's hovering at 4%.

*That's 610$ more per month than our current required mortgage.

That's 7,320$ more per year than our current required mortgage.

Nearly 90k$ more per decade than our current required mortgage.*

My concern:**

We could swing it, probably pretty comfortably. It leaves us less wiggle room if something were to happen. We do have an emergency fund and a lot of fluid funds but more is always better. We won't be able to do as many ""fun"" things. We won't be able to put away as much money for retirement and kids college. We will be paying less than we have been for the last 2 years or so, what with the double truck payments... But just think about what a grand total of 900$ per month more could do!

personalfinance,How to expand beyond target retirement funds (Vanguard)?,"I have a solid amount of money tied up in target retirement/lifecycle funds, and I am looking to expand beyond that.  I am 31, single, not looking to buy a home/have kids in the next few years.


Currently, I have:

Roth IRA in Vanguard 2060 target retirement fund (VTTSX): $49k


So I feel like I am pretty well covered on the general retirement front.  I'm looking to expand into other Vanguard funds, but would buying more index funds similar to what I already have be duplicative? 

I just dropped $10k into Vanguard's 500 Index Fund Admiral Class (VFIAX), which is large cap.  Thinking about maybe doing the same with small/medium cap to spread around.  And maybe the same with an international fund.  But would this just be the same as what's currently in my target retirement funds, just on a larger scale?

btc,"(RICO) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act, mining cartels, Blockstream, and You","Note: IANAL and Blockstream is based in Canada.  We need proper Canadian lawyers to look into this.  Canada has strong antitrust and anti-racketeering laws as well as the USA.

I started thinking about this topic while I was reading that Greg Maxwell was threatening the BU team with legal action for the use of the word ""Blockstream"" in one of BUs configuration variables (absurd but true).

""That's interesting,"" I thought.  ""We're going to fight in court apparently.  I wonder what sort of legal violations Blockstream might be guilty of?""

I'm presenting this layperson analysis to stimulate discussion about two things:

1. were actual crimes committed by Blockstream (I think so)

2. regardless of criminality, the community needs to expose this harmful behavior for what it is and call out Blockstream once and for all as an *attacker*

I'd like to review the history and offer my interpretation in the hopes that actual discussion can take place:

- On February 21st, 2016, a group of miners with a significant hashpower majority entered into an agreement brokered by Adam Back, the President of Blockstream, which declared among other things:

- (a) That miners would only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems

- (b) That Core would continue to follow strategies that limit capacity to no more than 4MB, max

In my opinion, 1a and 1b taken together define a cartel, ""an association of suppliers with the purpose of maintaining prices at a high level and restricting competition""

At least in the USA, the landmark Sherman antitrust act in the USA explicitly outlaws such cartels:

- (c) Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal

- (d) Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a **felony**

I believe that a good case can be made that Adam Back, acting as President of Blockstream (1), facilitated and contracted with various miners to create a capacity-limiting, anti-competitive cartel that violates the federal antitrust statutes in the USA, if not Canada.

Now how about racketeering?  How is racketeering defined?

In the USA we define it loosely as ""a service that is fraudulently offered to solve a problem, such as for a problem that does not actually exist, that will not be put into effect, or that would not otherwise exist if the racket did not exist. ""

This one is easy.  I'd argue that the nonexistent problem is ""Bitcoin cannot scale"" and ""block sizes must be kept tiny"" which creates the ""problem of high fees.""  The fraudulent solution is Blockstream / Lightning Network, whose need is 100% dependent on Bitcoin being unable to work as originally designed.

In my opinion, that's racketeering, folks.

RICO violations can get you 20 years in the federal pen in the USA.

(1) Blockstream attempted to distance itself from Adam after he created the cartel by claiming that Adam spoke as ""an individual"" not as ""President of Blockstream"" which is ludicrous and will be laughed out of court.  Adam isn't a call center rep, and he wasn't speaking at a PTA meeting.",cryptocurrency,1481384325

He told me to come in and see him and not to worry.  

He got me approved for financing without a co-signer and no proof of income or down payment.  I bought a vehicle for $25,000 and have a pretty shitty interest rate but was told to refinance in a year once my credit improved, but I owe nearly double that on the vehicle as a result.

personalfinance,Should a Purchase an Extended Warranty? 2008 Jeep Wrangler,"I bought a 2008 Wrangler earlier this year.

I do have the option of buying an extended warranty at this time or within the next several months (through Chrysler/Mopar), which will cost around $3000-4000.

I am also trying to rebuild my credit so, if I don't get the warranty, I have considered putting around $2000-$2500 on a secured credit card (I bank with Navy Federal, which is not as terrible on interest as some other secured cards) and using that as an emergency fund for car repairs. It seems like this should help my credit score by lowering my credit utilization, but then I worry about what to do if the repairs cost more than that and with having to spend extra to rent a car while it is being fixed.

- My husband will be attending college full time starting Fall 2017, this money will not be going toward his expenses/loans.

- We plan to live on-campus for the years that we can (we don't know yet if there will be enough slots available for married housing), and he will be attending school for eight years.

- We are planning for him not to work while he's at school, but he's stated that he will work part time if it's necessary to pay our bills.

- I work part time at a job I love and don't qualify for benefits.

- We have one credit card, in my name; it's an American Eagle credit card that I used to buy two pairs of jeans and then paid off (but the card is still active). We have no credit card debt.

- We owe about $900 to the government because I didn't have health insurance last year, and will owe them about $1200 next tax season for it as well.

- I'm a college drop-out and haven't pursued higher education because I have no real passions.

- We are not having children.

- At some point before the end of next year, to visit Japan for a week.

- We have no idea where we want to live after he's graduated, but we are willing to move depending on where his job takes him.

personalfinance,"Lots of student loans, semi-unique situation as an overseas teacher. Looking for advice!","I'm reposting this from a few days ago, hoping it'll get a little more traction than it did the other day. I have $66,000 in student loans.

**Personal Situation**: My wife just told me last week she's leaving me because she's unhappy. So I now need to re-adjust my financial viewpoint (as well as a lot of other things). I'm going to continue teaching overseas, partially because it's a lot more lucrative than teaching at home (unless you all can tell me it actually isn't - see below).

**The loans**: I currently have $66,000 in student loans, and climbing. My loan provider groups them into 8 groups with various interest rates between 3.4% and 6.8% (all of them are federal loans, either subsidized or unsubsidized, taken out between 2010-2015). Starting next month, I will begin making minimum payments of $221 for the next year - I am on the income driven repayment plan, and haven't made enough to pay until now.

**The Income/Career**: I am a teacher, teaching in the Middle East. I make about $35,000 a year - tax free &amp; free rent (provided). I will be leaving after this school year, but likely to a very similar financial situation, just in a new country. I need a change of scenery, partially because of the country, partially the school, and partially the soon to be ex-wife :( 

**Spending**: I know what my wife and I spent together, and so I've taken those numbers and adjusted them to somewhat lower spending per person and for only one person, as she spent more than me and I'm willing to live cheaper than she was:
&gt; * $500/mo ($4,500 for school year) for spending (food, occasional fun, taxis - no car here)
* $1,000/mo during the summer ($3000) - it's hard not to spend more when visiting home and friends, not working (or at least not working as much - more free time to spend money), etc.
* $3000 a year for travelling on long weekends (4 $750 trips)
* $6000 a year for longer trips (spring break, Christmas, etc. - 3 $2000 trips)
* minimum $221 to student loans per month (x12 = 
This leaves me with: 35,000(income)-19,152(above spending)= **$15,848 in potential savings/loan payments a year**.

**The Catch**: There is a program in the U.S. for public school teachers that, if you teach for 10 years, while making the minimum payment the entire time (120 payments), the government will forgive the rest of your federal loan debt (and all of my debt is federal). See the options below.

**The Options**:
&gt; * **Option 1**: With this option, I would put this money into savings. Teach two more years abroad, then move home, use the money to get me settled there (car, maybe even buy a home), etc, and begin the clock ticking on the 10 years.
&gt; * **Option 2**: Move home immediately to get the clock ticking on the ten years. I could have $13,000 saved by the end of this year (this year is unique because until last week my finances were shared), and more if I travel less (although that's kind of the point of living abroad). Hope I get a job back home, as the teaching market is harder there for a social studies teacher (me) than abroad. *This is my least favorite option, as I want to ideally continue to travel/live abroad.*
&gt; * **Option 3**: Stay living abroad and teaching abroad, but ignore the loan forgiveness program. Immediately begin paying my loans off, quickly, and don't wait for the 10 years. Just settle it.

So, all that being said, what do you all this is the best option, particularly for my finances? Is it risky to wait potentially 12+ years to settle these loans? Is there a 4th, better option, I didn't think of? I look forward to your opinions.

**TLDR**: I have a lot of loan debt, don't know whether to start paying off now or not because of teacher loan forgiveness program. The situation is further complicated by living overseas and wanting to travel.",finance,1481466553

personalfinance,Should we buy a house?,"Hey everyone,

My wife and I are trying to decide whether to buy a house and could use some guidance.  Here's our situation:

My wife and I are both turning 30 and live in an expensive city with rapidly rising housing costs.  I currently make just over $75k per year and my wife makes $95k.  In late summer/early fall 2017, I will be switching to a new job.  When I come onboard, I will receive a one-time (pre-tax) bonus of around $70k-$80k, and my new salary will be in the mid-$200k range (excluding bonuses, but I'd like to ignore those for purposes of this question).  Due to the pecularities of my industry, I can realistically expect to stay in this job for only a limited period of time-- let's say 3 years to be conservative.  When I move on, my salary will probably be cut in half.

Unfortunately, my wife and I have a large amount of educational debt.  I have about $180k in student loans, and she has over $200k.  We are both on income-driven repayment plans now, so our monthly payments are pretty reasonable.  Fortunately, my wife's debt will be forgiven in about 9 years through her job.  Mine, we will half to pay off, but we plan to do so aggressively when I begin my new job.

My wife and I would like to start a family soon, and, because two-bedroom apartments are so expensive here (median, we think, is about $3000 a month), we thought it might make sense to buy, particularly in light of the mortgage interest deduction.  We met with a loan officer who told us that we could get qualified for a $375k mortgage at a 4.6% interest rate.  We don't have a ton saved up for a downpayment and think that, given the interest rates on my student loans, it makes sense to throw excess money at them.  Fortunately, due to generous loved ones, we have access to the equivalent of a few percent (&lt;5%) as a downpayment.  That would mean, however, that we'd have to pay a few hundred in mortgage insurance each month.  Our note, excluding mortgage insurance, would be about $1,900 per month.  We figured that, once my loans were paid off, we'd make aggressive payments toward the house to try to reach 20% principal paid off (so as to remove the mortgage insurance requirement).  Our goal is to do so before our combined mortgage insurance payments exceed the amount that our loved ones enabled us to put down.

Overall, I'm curious to know if people think this makes sense, or if we should wait a few years, given that, by then, our debt will be lower and our income higher.  Also, because we've never bought a house before, are there monthly/yearly costs that we should be prepared for other than note, utilities, mortgage insurance, property taxes, HOA fees, and some fixed amount that we set aside to cover repairs?

Since I am living at home currently I pay no rent and save most of my money since my only costs are gas and whenever I decide to go out with friends.

This brings me to the title in question.  I recently started looking around at apartments to which surprised me that my monthly note would be lower if I bought compared to renting.  After I mentioned it to my dad, he explained how he believes owning is better than renting, and thinks it is a good idea to look into some places in a couple months and buying if a find the right one.  He also said he would give me $10-$15,000 to help me out if I wanted it.  

So I've been looking around and have found some places ranging from $110 - $140k that are nice and in good areas.   My mother thinks it is dumb and the earliest I should even begin to look is around June/July, while my dad thinks earlier is better since interest rates are currently rising.    I was thinking I could save up a little more and start looking around February/March and maybe by April pull the trigger.

After trying to estimate a monthly expense budget if I would move out, I kept getting around $2000 in expenses a month, which would leave me with $500-$850 leftover at end of the month.  This is including me contributing 4% to my 401k for full match and $50 a week I put in savings (low I know, but  since I had over $9,000 in savings I figured I didn't need to put much more).

Oh and I plan on staying at this location for 5+ years and possibly 10 if that makes a difference.  I also thought if/when I move I could rent it out (I understand the risks)

I know kind of long winded but was hoping to hear some opinions and get advice.  I looked on sidebar and searched previously but was hoping to get some specifics with my situation.",finance,1481488912

To everyone out there with student loans, I understand that it can be difficult reading posts about other FI people’s net worth at $100k, $250k, etc.  However, I can attest that the joy of not having student loans is incredible!  Stay strong!

**Financial Background:**  

* Age 25M  
* Working in management consulting  
* Blessed to have starting salary at $75k  
* Received promotions after 6 months and 1 year resulting in salary bumps to $78k and $103k respectively   
* Parents were unable to provide any financial assistance for my college  
* Graduated with $67,474 in student loans  

**Process:**

* I stuck to a strict budget which allowed me to put away ~50%-60% of take home pay to loans  
* All tax returns, bonuses and stock options were used to max out Roth and all remaining to loans  
* Refinanced and consolidated loans (Parent Plus &amp; Stafford) with DRB.  Interest rate went from 7.14%(weighted average) to 4% 

 
**Results:**

* Overall I paid $1,312 in interest  
* Refinancing my loans saved me $4,030.39 in interest  
* Aggressively paying off my loans in 25 months vs. 10 years saved me $25,810.38 in interest

While some on here will argue that refinancing federal loans into private loans is too risky, I was confident that my employment would be stable enough to allow me to pay off my loans quickly.  Also, I am aware that a 4% interest rate is arguably low enough that you should pay the minimum and invest all excess $ in investments.  History has proven this statement, but I felt more comfortable with the guaranteed “return” on my loans vs. investing.",finance,1481493956

personalfinance,$40K in Student Loans. Repay or invest? Information overload causing paralysis.,"Hi All,

Let me start off by saying that I've read the guides on this sub and understand that I should probably pay off the debt before I invest but a part of me feels like I'm going to regret missing out on the compound interest of investing. 

I'm looking for some thoughts and/or guidance around my personal situation. Any advice would be welcomed and appreciated. 

Here's the gist:

Bio:

* 29 years old
* $92K/year
* $15,000 in Emergency Fund
* $12,000 in Savings Account 

Assets:

* $18,500 (rollover from 403b to traditional IRA via Betterment)
* $ 5,700 (Roth IRA via Schwab)
* $11,000 (SIMPLE IRA via Schwab)

Student Loan Debt:

* Loan A (Private): $8,250 @ 4.375%
* Loan B (Private): $10,350 @ 5.25%
* Loan C (Private): $6,500 @ 4.25%
* Loan D (Fed): $2,325 @ 6.55%
* Loan E (Fed): $4,850 @ 6.55%
* Loan F (Fed): $4,650 @ 5.75%
* Loan G (Fed): $1,800 @ 6.55%
* Loan H (Fed): $2,125 @ 4.5%

Here's my plan of attack:

* Go Avalanche and take the $12,000 in my savings (+ a bit from checking) and essentially pay off Loans D, E, F, and G.
* I am expecting $12,000 from a relative in the spring which I can use to pay off Loan B and H
* All the while I'm going to increase my monthly contribution to $1000. This should put me on track to pay off the rest by Spring 2018.

I am also in the process of rolling over the SIMPLE IRA to a 401K via Vanguard as our company's plan is changing. But that's another post for another time. Either way, part of me feels like the interest on these loans is relatively low that I may be better served at least maxing out my Roth IRA for 2016 and possibly 2017 (even though the FAQs on the site seem to suggest that I should pay off the debt first).

Does my plan make sense? What should I be doing differently? 

Thanks so much for reading.

personalfinance,My mother is facing foreclosure and needs advising on her options,"So my mother has fallen into a pretty serious financial hole and is in the beginning stages of having our house foreclosed. She asked me what I thought she should do, but I'm just a young soon-to-be-college grad who has no experience with finances of this grand of a scale. So I come to you, /r/personalfinance , asking what she should do. She just wants to know all of her options and which ones may be better than others; she's already considering just getting rid of the house, but she would like to be able to save and keep it if possible. And before I go any further, don't worry guys! I have no plans of signing my name on anything or taking any loans for this. She came to me purely for advice, not financial help. Sorry in advance for the wall of text, but I just want to be as detailed as possible.


Right now she has an outstanding balance of $61k on the house (that's including fees from not paying). She hasn't made any mortgage payments since this past Summer because of some poor advice from some financial adviser who told her not to make payments so a loan mod could be processed in order to try and get her a lower interest rate (her current interest rate on the mortage is 6.1%). Now, in addition to the $61k, that same financial adviser says she will have to pay lawyer fees for the foreclosure (whether the foreclosure actually happens or not), and she (the adviser) doesn't know how much those will be. My mother has roughly $16k or so saved aside from the period of time she hasn't been making payments, $2k in rent checks that she has to deposit, and she will be getting a $27k-30k tax return in 1-3 months. However, the money from the tax return will likely not be here in time to help with her current predicament. Right now she's been applying for personal/home-equity loans in order to obtain a large portion of the remaining amount she has to cover, but because of her poor credit (from not making payments) she hasn't had much luck securing one yet.


Her goal is to get a $35k-40k loan, combine that with her $18k, and borrow $5k-10k from close friends (which she has high confidence she'll be able to do), and then use that lump sum of $58k-68k to pay off the balance (plus lawyer fees if possible) in order to try and save the house. Then when she gets her tax return, she'd use that $27k-30k to pay majority of the loan she took in order to minimize interest that could accrue, hopefully leaving behind only $8k-13k . Then she'd continue to make normal mortgage payments and throw any residual income at the new loan until its completely gone, and finally then pay back the friends she borrowed from.


Basically, the main thing is she needs to be able to buy enough time for her tax return to come in and gain a little bit more funds, and then she thinks she can recover from all this and be back on track for mortgage payments. But actually getting a loan or stalling the bank any longer hasn't proven to be fruitful so far.


Other details: Her gross annual income is $118k, but after taxes, her student loans, etc, she takes home roughly $5488 a month (only $65856 annually, BEFORE bills). I am unsure of how much the electric/heating/etc bills are. The whole reason she's had difficult with payments and fell into this hole in the first place is because, unbeknownst to me, she prioritized paying for my tuition over any other bills, which I feel incredibly guilty (but grateful) for. I start working at the beginning of January, and plan to give her money in return for the sacrifices she's made and try to help out, but that can only be helpful if we can stall the foreclosure long enough for her to recover in the first place. I am graduating in a couple months, so my tuition is no longer a financial burden to her and she'll be able to make the house her #1 priority now. She also has another income from renting one of the apartments through Air B&amp;B (its a two family home, my grandparents lived in the other apartment but are moving out). That's gotten her some decent money, but it can be an inconsistent income. She and I don't really understand how equity works for the sake of a home-equity loan, but I know that the house was bought for $414k with a $25k down-payment and a $385k 30 year mortgage, and she's paid $95k towards the mortgage so far and has also made quite a few renovations to the house.


And as aforementioned, she's not completely against the idea of just letting the house go, but she'd prefer to be able to sell the house that way she can A) Continue to get the Air B&amp;B income B) Have more time to consider selling the house and not having to do a short-sale.


So guys, what can be done? What do you think she should do? Any and all advice would be appreciated.",finance,1481505639

personalfinance,I can afford a house but am currently single. Should I think about buying now just to lock in at this current interest rate?,"I am 35 years old, single and am currently renting a room at a friend’s house for $400/month. It is definitely time to make a change, but I am struggling on how to approach this. If I could find a reasonably priced house I could probably pay 20% down at this point. This seems pretty appealing (I would definitely try to rent out one or two of the house’s bedrooms unless/until I get married).

I would totally be fine with a townhome or condo as well, but since I would likely move if I get married I don’t know if I like the idea of buying a condo only to have to turn around and try to sell or rent it out within the next 5 years. I want to make the wisest financial decision I can, but I am strongly considering just getting an apartment for at least a year to continue deliberating (and saving) before buying anything. After doing the math I would probably only be spending an additional $6,000/year or so going from my current setup to an apartment. I suppose it is “throwing money away” to some degree, but I could live with that knowing that I am more or less financially ready to buy something when I choose to pursue that. I am hoping I would only need to live in an apartment for 1-3 years before being ready to purchase a home.

It has been 15 years since I’ve lived in an apartment, so I am also thinking it might be wise to get one for at least a year to see if I would like condo living before just diving into a condo. Again, I think I would enjoy taking on the challenge of owning a house too. I’m a bit pensive about the challenge of a house, but I think if a good opportunity came I would still strongly consider it.

So what this all adds up to is that I’m at a bit of a stalemate. I am wondering if the interest rate situation should factor into my equation at all. I know mortgage interest rates in the U.S. just went up a little bit recently. Everything I’ve heard seems to suggest that the pendulum is starting to swing back towards higher rates and will continue that way for a while.

Since I am considering all three of the options (apartment/condo/house) should the interest rate factor perhaps boost my consideration for buying a house sooner? I don’t see myself leaving the area I’m in, but I suppose if I got married that could potentially throw the whole interest rate factor out the window. If my theoretical wife wanted to move into a different house than the one I would theoretically own at that point, we would have to lock into a new interest rate anyway.

I am just curious how big of a factor the whole interest rate thing should be. I dread the thought of waiting several years before buying anything and seeing interest rates dramatically increase. But, I do have a good amount of money saved and should be able to keep saving. Another thing I was curious about is if mortgage rates skyrocket is it reasonable to expect that interest rates on savings accounts will also come up? I have heard that this was how things were years ago. If this were the case I think I could rest a little bit easier since I have a lot of cash in high-yield savings right now.

personalfinance,Six Figures In Medical Debt Sent To Collections - Uninsured,"I was in a pretty bad car accident about 11 months ago. Actually I was driving to my family's home in an adjacent state on Christmas Eve. Happened on the interstate. Spent about two weeks in the hospital. Had multiple surgeries and racked up quite a large medical bill. Roughly 250K before the hospitals assistance program. I didn't have insurance at the time. While I don't want the focus to be on the recklessness of being 28 without insurance, I'm sure that will come into play at some point. Yes. I should have had it. But I didn't want to pay for it. So I opted out. That's all there is to it. Yes, it was a terrible decision in hindsight but there's nothing I can do to fix that unless someone knows where I can find blueprints for a working time machine. But I digress.

According to the police report it was my fault. I have no recollection. I was knocked out cold. At the same time, I also only had the lowest tier car insurance. They covered a whopping $5,500. I've been calling myself frugal forever. Maybe I'm just cheap.

Last week I checked my credit score, like I do every week, and it has tanked over 100 points into the 610 range. Unfortunately that's not my biggest issue. I wish it were. I've come to peace with the fact that lenders won't touch me with a ten foot pole for the next half decade or say. Maybe even longer. That's fine. 

But here's what's not fine. After their assistance program kicked in my bill was cut down to roughly $146k. Obviously I don't want to pay it. And again, let's try and keep this discussion away from morality issues. Now, I received a letter from the hospital about six months ago letting me know that they had generously turned my quarter million dollar bill into one even more manageable. $146k. I called them and they said that yea it looks like you owe that much. Too which I responded that I'd have to file bankruptcy. They asked if I had spoken with a lawyer. I told them that, believe it or not, I'm a lawyer. They asked what I was going to do. I said, again, that I was probably going to have to file bankruptcy.

Now, on top of this I have roughly $180k in student loans from law school and undergrad. They're all federally subsidized direct and direct plus loans.

Additionally, I just graduated last year and went to law school with $0 in assets. So my job now is the first job I've ever had. Well, at least one in which I'm paid a salary. I started roughly 3 or 4 months ago. I have a few thousand dollars in a taxable account that I've saved up working summers and whatnot. I'm basically living very frugally off of that because I've been deferring north of 50% of my paycheck into a traditional IRA since I started (actually the month after because eligibility requires 30 days employment first) because I want to hit the 18K cap this year. 

Back to the point. I don't specialize in bankruptcy and I wouldn't dare try and undergo this on my own. I work in litigation and, again, I've only been doing this for about a year. No way I have the experience or knowledge to figure it out in a way I'd feel comfortable with.

From my calculations, I should be able to reduce my taxable income to roughly $30k this year. I don't know if that matters. But I'm trying to include as many details as possible. Next year will be quite different and closer to $100k.

I've been utilizing PAYE since graduation. Like other controversial things I may have said that run contrary to PF general thought, it makes sense for me. I'm happy to extend payment ten more years in exchange for having immediate liquidity. Yes. I could pay it off. In fact, I save a large portion of my income and always have. Having cash in the bank gives me more peace of mind than paying down federally subsidized debt. Again, I digress, and again, this isn't the point of my post. I'm happy to discuss the merits of PAYE vs. standard repayment vs. accelerated repayment at some point in the near future. But not now.

So, PF. What are the odds I get sued? I don't see any reason to speak with a lawyer until that happens. But if you disagree, please speak up. I'm looking for objective opinions and advice. Or if there's anything I'm not thinking about, I'd like to hear that too. What are my options? What are your thoughts? What am I overlooking?",finance,1481515083

She is halfway through 11th grade, and at this point is on track to graduate on time. She is not at all intellectually disabled,  however she does have some moderate learning disabilities and depression, anxiety, severe PTSD. Emotionally she is more like 7 or 8 than 17. Her father is currently in jail awaiting trial for child abuse,  and will likely be in there until his 70's, so there will be little no money coming from him. 

Another piece of information that factors in is that I was told by her father's brother that her father's grandmother is setting up trust funds for each grandchild and great grandchild with ""enough to pay for four years of college"" and it comes with the stipulation that it cannot be used at a for-profit institution. I am basically planning on handling the costs of whatever we do on my own, because you should never count on money for anything until you actually have it. 

Ok, so here's the dilemma.  She wants to get a massage therapy license after high school. I think this is a great plan. I am licensed myself, and can help her out with lots of things including job networking after she finishes. It takes less than a year of school, and isn't particularly difficult to get through. 

I've been looking at schools in the area and there are two that look like the best options:

School 1:
State funded technical college (non-profit)
Accredited and eligible for federal loans 
She could choose to stay in a bit longer and get an associate of applied sciences
She could potentially take some classes for dual credit while still in high school for free (we would need to find out more about how much of the course work she could complete before graduation)
Cost for the licensing program is about $6000 give or take, and roughly twice that for the A.A.S. 
On the minus side,  it's in another city. Taking the bus is possible but very time consuming. We do not own a car and no one in my household is currently able to drive. So we'd either have to get her a car and driver's ed, or pay for an apartment closer to campus. Those run at least $800 a month for a studio. 

School 2:
Very small privately owned school (for profit, no federal loans)
10 minute walk from our apartment
I know one of the instructors there and volunteer there regularly 
Cost is about 10,000 and we would need to take out private loans to pay for it

So, I have some major concerns about her living on her own, even though School 1 has some big benefits.  Plus there is the cost.  She's not that interested in driving either, so that may not be a realistic option. School #2 is a very good school, but there are some drawbacks with that one too.

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin might fail (mainstream adoption).,"here's why I think bitcoin might fail:

1. Transaction times: I have been using bitcoin a fair bit recently, but god the transaction times are frustratingly slow. You could NEVER and I repeat NEVER have mainstream adoption with these transaction times. They are simply terrible. From my understanding, it is due to the block size (correct me if I am wrong). If I am right, the block size NEEDS to be increased. If it isn't increased the developers are going to be shooting themselves in the foot plain and simple.

2. Isn't bitcoin supposed to be decentralized? To me it seems (I may be misguided) a few core developers choose where bitcoin is headed. Shouldn't there be a method to vote which way bitcoin goes? 
To me, this seems no different than the federal reserve choosing to print money to stimulate the economy without anyone having any say (not even the government) on the matter. We need DECENTRALIZATION like everyone claims bitcoin has (which it clearly doesn't).

3. I'm concerned about fee's. Transaction fee's seem to be a block to mainstream adoption. If I want to buy a chocolate bar and I get charged a 5 cent fee every time. That is an issue in my eyes. Also, mining is also becoming centralized because it's become too hard for the average rig to mine blocks. A majority of fees and block rewards will be going to a few miners. A big transfer of wealth would potentially go to miners if the bitcoin wasn't circulated into the economy fast enough (once again I may be misguided here).

There's many more obstacles in my mind. I think this is enough to get some feedback though for now. Please share your thoughts! Thanks.",cryptocurrency,1481529598

I am a public school teacher who teaches in a high burnout rate subject area.  I would like to return to graduate school to become a school psychologist.  The only programs I've found which would allow me to work for the majority of my program are private, and thus, more expensive.  I have approximately $37k in existing student debt, the majority being in Stafford loans and one private loan which is $10k with a 10.5% interest rate.  I pay the minimums every month, which totals to a bit over $500.  I am currently on a standard repayment plan and set to receive about $9000 in loan forgiveness in the next 3 years due to my chosen profession (distributed as $3k a year).  My rent is $1450 a month and likely will be increasing with each year by $100-$200 (I live in an expensive area and this is the lowest rent I could find in my neighborhood).  I make $63k a year.  I am single.  The minimum for the program I would like to enter is $34k, more if I choose to pursue a doctoral degree (which I want to).  I would also have to take one year and quit my current job and complete a low paying internship, which would pay approximately $40k-$50k.  I have no credit card debt and my car is paid for.  I would be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness as a school psychologist and my starting salary could be anywhere from $60k-$80k depending on where I work.  I saw a financial planner about this decision who told me to just go ahead and take out the loans and do it, but I'm skeptical.

My questions:

-What would my payments look like after taking out this amount of debt?

-Would income based repayment be smart?

-Is this a good idea or is this dream just outside of my financial means?  I really don't want to make a poor financial decision but also really want to pursue this dream as well.

personalfinance,Looking for advice - buying a house,"Hey guys,

&amp;nbsp;

Long time lurker, first time poster here. I have been following the advice of this subreddit for a while. Paying down my high interest rate debt first and trimming my monthly expenses and have almost reached the point where I am debt free aside from my mortgage. 

&amp;nbsp;

My wife and I had out first child this year and are looking to move into a bigger place in a nicer neighborhood with good schools etc etc. I have crunched the numbers and feel fairly confident but would appreciate any feedback - positive or negative to help me make this decision. 

&amp;nbsp;

First of all: The house
$399,000 w/ ~$30-40,000 downpayment depending on how much we get for our place.

&amp;nbsp;

Once we move in we will also need to spend a bit on new appliances as the ones we have now will not fit and will be sold with our current place.

&amp;nbsp;

The roof/landscaping/fence/deck/finished basement is all done so no major renovations needed in the near future.

Second: monthly income vs expenses

&amp;nbsp;

expenses:
$195 2x cell phones (Ontario cell plans are this expensive unfortunately)
$200 water/power
$50 natural gas
$120 internet/tv
$150 low interest government student loan
$650 Insurance (house/cars x2/life x3)
$1840 mortgage
$350 land taxes

&amp;nbsp;

$3500 total monthly expenses + miscellaneous + savings (retirement/education) + eventually daycare 

&amp;nbsp;

This will realistically be closer to $5000-5500 if I am saving what I would like to as well as the daycare costs/groceries/fuel for vehicles/etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Our combined monthly take-home income after taxes is $7000/month. This leaves at least $1500/month for other unexpected expenses or saving for bigger purchases. 

&amp;nbsp;

On paper I think it looks manageable. This is on a 20 year mortgage so I would have the option to extend it out at my next renewal if I needed to but I would need to make this work for another 4 years or so. What I don't want is to feel 'house poor' but at the same time, having a practical home with enough space for our family is a big priority for my wife and I so we are willing to penny pinch a bit to make this work.

Edit: as mentioned in a comment below, we were planning to wait a few years to move but the housing market is very competitive where I live and this house is being sold by a friend who is letting us have the first shot at it if we want it.

Moving earlier than we were planning will save us the hassle of fighting for a place we like and potentially having a long drawn out process of securing a place later on.

personalfinance,[UK] Is it worth it to pay back student loan early?,"I have about £18,500 left on my account. I'm living in the USA, probably for the rest of my life as my wife is American. I typically send evidence of my income every February and then pay annually as a lump sum. By this February, I'll have about £10,000. Would it be worth paying back the minimum annual repayments or just paying back this £10,000? Interest rates are related to inflation (supposedly) and its 1.25% right now. My UK ISA can get more than this I think. If aggressive, I could probably pay off the remaining £8,500 by Dec 2017.

personalfinance,Non-existent wages from a non-existent job being garnished for a tax debt.,"I'll quickly preface this by saying that I normally have no problem living within my means, settle my debts quickly, and mostly never rely much on credit or using debt as a means to an end.  So I have very little experience about what to do when something has gotten out of hand as I normally just pay my damn bills.

Just not this time.  I moved from one state to another and due to my wife mistakenly under-reporting her income from a 6 month job, we ended up owing the state we used to live in about $500.

At the time, due to the costs of moving and everything else, we were only able to pay off the federal tax that we owed.  As life threw more impossible-to-ignore expenses at us, we put the tax bill on the back burner and eventually just pushed it off the burner entirely.  We did receive a few notices, including from some private collection agency, but we never responded.

It's been about a year and a half now, and we just moved back into the original state.  I hadn't completely forgotten the bill, and I actually do have the money to pay it now, all in one payment.  I had planned on going to a local IRS office and getting that going.

Only, like the worst welcome letter ever, I received a new notice stating that there was a judgement against me and that a notice of garnishment of wages had been delivered to my employer.  My *former* employer.  Where I worked in the other state.  There is nothing for them to garnish from me there.  Otherwise I'd just shrug it off and let them do what they got to do.

I won't be working for up to a month from now but have a fair sized chunk of savings for now.  Enough to pay off this debt and not worry about it.

I suppose at this juncture I am just unsure as to how to go about that now.  The paperwork I received is quite confusing.  A bunch of letters/copies of letters about how I need to send an acknowledgement or something.  Honestly I'm not quite sure what it's asking for me to do and not quite sure which papers are meant to be for me vs. my former employer and which I need to sign or what.  This paperwork is all from the court, not the IRS, so there's nothing in there for me to address a payment to.

So, I suppose I have two questions.  One, how do I just pay this thing already?  Two, what do I do with these garnishment papers from the court?

Next time I'll certainly just find a way to pay my tax bill.  Hindsight, yada yada.  For now, I would really greatly appreciate any advice!  Thank you!",finance,1481564441

Deferred Interest – A non-amortizing loan with no payments until the principal and deferred interest are due.

Reduced Interest  – A non-amortizing interest only loan with a low interest rate. The loan has low or no payments until the principal is due.

Zero Interest  – A non-amortizing loan with no payments until the principal is due. The ZIP loan may have a forgivable feature.

personalfinance,27 years old with 135k in Student Loan Debt and 3/4 of a music degree. Need Advice in conquering this mountain of debt!,"So, here's my story:  

Grew up in a middle class household where parents fell in some kind of grey area with FAFSA and I didn't qualify for any financial aid. Though, money was always a struggle for them. I had dreams of attending Berklee College of Music, a private college with a huge price tag. So, early on my mother signed me up for a butt load of credit cards and was very diligent about making the payments on time, as an effort to raise my credit score higher than my parents. It worked. I was accepted to the college and so, my mother, I'm sure with no idea what else to do, set off on a mission to find me loans.  

I applied for these loans with a 740 FICO score and Chase (30k), Saillie Mae (60k), Berklee (10k) and the US Dept of Education (my only federal loans)(25K), all hooked me up with money. An 18 year old, only ever having held one job, making $6 an hour. HA! I'm a little bitter if you can't tell... And, some additional debt, not added, comes from interest, fees, etc. Not sure what the interest rates on each are but I know they span between 6-13%.  

I left Berklee in 2011 with 3/4 of a degree, very regretfully so. My family was going through hardship, my parents were getting divorced, and I left school. Originally the plan while my parents were together, was that, they were going to pay half my loans. But, circumstances changed as the household split.  

All of my loans are currently in default.  

I just setup a payment with the debt collector holding my Sallie Mae loans for $125 each a month, so $250, per month for SM. I also setup a $90/mo income based repayment with the US Dept. of Education, which according to them after paying that amount for 9 months on time, the account will become active again.

They've asked me if I'd like to settle the debt and in some instances are ready to take 1/3 of what's owed, ex. Sallie Mae offered to take $10k for one of the $30k notes.

investing,BOJ to consider tightening????,"&gt; The latest buzz in Japanese monetary-policy circles is that the BOJ may have to lift the 10-year government-bond target from a recently set zero..... As yields rise around the world—led by the U.S., whose Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates on Dec. 14—the gap between Japan and other markets widens. That draws money out of Japan as investors search for better returns, which puts further pressure on the yen..... For Abenomics skeptics, the yen’s deteriorating prospects ring alarm bells.  BNP Paribas chief Japan economist Ryutaro Kono said in a recent note for clients that a fall to ¥115 to the dollar could upset consumers by raising the cost of living. When BOJ easing weakened the yen to ¥125 to the dollar from ¥110 between autumn 2014 and summer of 2015, it cast a chill over the economy as rising costs for imported food and necessities battered consumers while companies held back from raising wages. Other Japanese economists say the BOJ may have to raise its bond-yield target just to give more breathing room to the country’s banks, whose profits are dwindling as their longer-term lending rates fall dangerously close to what they’re paying on deposits.

personalfinance,Car rental nightmare. What are my options?,"Over the summer I had an internship for which I needed a vehicle because I couldn't find housing a reasonable distance from the company. Before the internship began I made a reservation with some horrible company (Avis) and used the company's discount code. 

I was told by the agent making the reservation that the discount code would waive underage fees. The agent told me the rental for two months would cost about $2k. When the agent handed me a printed out quote, it was charging me $4k, instead. The agent said something was wrong with the system, but that he couldn't do anything and suggested I call customer service. 

I did as instructed and customer service said that the source of the discrepancy was the underage fee. They removed that and sent me an updated reservation. I asked to make sure that I would not be charged the underage fee, and the customer service representative confirmed.

Later, when I arrived at the rental desk to pick up the car,  the agents at the desk again confirmed that I was not being charged an underage fee. There was some confusion on the price and I again heard a number around $4k. However, by the end, I was being charged $2k and again confirmed with the agent that I wasn't being charged an underage fee. 

I later realized that I was charged $2k because the rental was split into separate 30 day periods and the $2k was for only one period. Frustrated that Avis was attempting to charge me $2k more than we agreed upon, I attempted to call Avis. The national phone line informed me that I had to deal with the local branch from where I had picked up the car. 

I tried calling the local branch literally dozens of times with no one (not even a machine) answering the phone; after a minute or two of ringing,  the line would disconnect. Eventually, I was able to speak with an agent who told me that I needed to talk to a particular manager. I left my number with the understanding that the manager would call me when he got in. He never did.

I waited a week before attempting this process again. Each time, I had to call at least ten times before I was able to speak with anyone. The manager I needed to talk to was somehow never there. 

After going through this process dozens of times over the course of a month, I decided I would again attempt to deal with the company at the national level. After several conversations, I eventually talked with someone who said that they would refund me the underage fee. All I had to do was submit (to a certain email address) documentation showing the total amount I was charged and the amount I was told I would be charged. 

Of course, I complied. I received an automated email saying that I should expect a reply within 10 days. I waited. I never received a reply. I sent another email asking what had happened. Thus began an email exchange in which every email from Avis was sent at least 5 business days later than it was received. At the end of this email exchange, it became clear that Avis had no intention of issuing a refund.

Frustrated with the long delays in the email, I tried calling the customer service line again. I talked to someone who again said this matter had to be dealt with at the local level. I called the local branch literally one hundred times and was unable to talk to anyone. 

Finally fed up, I disputed the charge on my credit card and explained the situation to the credit card company. The credit card company ruled in my favour and performed the charge back.

Now, I've received a bill from Avis demanding the disputed amount. Perhaps I should have realized this was possible after a chargeback, but I must say it seems like a chargeback offers no protection, since the company can pursue debt collection afterwards. 

The bill includes instructions on how to dispute the charge, and I intend to follow through with these. I expect this will be unsuccessful, though. If so, what are my options? Obviously I can pay the amount, but I would much prefer not to, both on principle of being lied to and because $2k is fair amount of money to me. 

I apologize for the long story, but I wanted to give lots of details in case any of them are relevant.

personalfinance,(USA) Does doing a PhD later in life make sense... financially?,"Hello all,

I'm currently looking into returning to graduate school after taking some time off from undergrad.  If everything looks good and I'm accepted, I will be in my early 30s by the time I matriculate, and since I'm looking at PhD programs (in the biomedical sciences), I am looking at 5-7 years to complete my research and from there, possibly post-doctoral work or maybe industry.

Currently, I'm working as a research technician and I make around 45k/year.  After 7 years, I've moved into the highest position that my current employment can offer me and I expect top off around 50k/year.  This is also assuming my boss can keep me employed during this time.  My goal, however, is to eventually run a lab myself as I would like to pursue my own research endeavors, maybe teach at the collegiate level, and to do this I need a doctorate in my field.

But does it make sense financially for me to go back to school when I'm already in my early 30s?  I don't expect to get into the career I desire until I'm in my early 40s, and even then, PhDs in my field can start anywhere between 45k-80k (this is anecdotal based on peers and friends with the degree in my field, and includes academia and industry salaries).  So while I can't guarantee my income would increase significantly by going back to school compared to what I'm making now, it is possible that I will be able to eventually make more than what I'm topped off at with my current company.  

Also, all the programs I'm looking at offer anywhere between 27-31k/year in taxed research/teaching assistantships that are guaranteed for all students in good standing for up to 7 years.  Health insurance is included in this, but there are no 401k/403b options.  Cost of living is low to medium (I'm looking at schools in the midwest).  

I will be living with my spouse who works full time and makes around 40k/year with no debt.  Spouse is also maxing out employee retirement and fully contributing to an IRA each year.

For finances, I'm contributing to retirement in the form of a 403b, maxed out for employer matching, and still paying off some undergrad student debt (all federal loans).  No IRAs since I'm focusing on my student debt.

Current salary:  45k
Student Loans: ~12k left (@ 4.5%) all federal
Retirement savings:  ~30k-35k (I don't remember the exact number, maxed out for employer matching - this is both mine and my spouse's)
Savings:  ~30k (this is going towards our house downpayment)

My spouse and I both have cars that are paid off, and are looking into purchasing a house in the future, and considering purchasing when I'm in school.  No plans for children.

I have a current plan to apply to PhD programs in biomedical sciences, but do I have a right to be worried about my financial future?  Would I be better off in my current position, or possibly look into a company that could pay me more and be a technician forever?  Would my spouse and I be set up alright for retirement?  Or is this financial suicide for us?  My spouse is on board with me going back to school if I decide to.

investing,The attack on Cash and the case for gold?,"Recently finished reading the book, ""The Curse of Cash"" - Rogoff (https://www.amazon.com/Curse-Cash-Kenneth-S-Rogoff-ebook/dp/B01EMADYJ2)

It lays out a pretty compelling argument against cash. The gist of the book says that cash makes crime easier. Crimes including tax evasion, money laundering and black market transactions(including hiring illegal workers, drugs, guns, prostitution, etc). He highlights the anonymity that cash provides as main reason and main problem for law abiding citizens of our society.

He goes further mentioning that there's a very large amount of unaccounted for bills. An amount so large that there's no reasonable legal use for it. Rogoff argues that it must of in the hands of criminals. Just to put into perspective how much cash is floating around, here's a quote, 

""Almost 80% of the US currency supply is in $100 bills. How many people have 34 of them in their purses, cookie jars, or cars, as each individual would need to account for his or her share? And this is for every man, woman and child, so a four-person family would need to be holding $13,600 just in $100 bills, and that is not counting smaller bills.""

As many of you may be aware of, Rogoff has some good political connections since his previous book (""This Time is Different"" - Reinhart and Rogoff)  was used as the playbook for austerity.

Recently with the attacks on cash in India and now Venezuela, I wonder how fast and how far this idea can travel. I think it's only a matter of time before China is forced to enact something similar. Meaning, the two largest consumers of gold, will likely consume even more.

Alright, so you might be thinking, ""How is gold going to rise, in a rising interest rate environment?""

I believe as interest rates rise and government begins to feel the pressure(higher interest expenses) they will look to new areas of taxation. I believe attempts to tax illegal activities may be very easy(at least politically). If you had a choice tax legal or illegal activities, I think it would be pretty easy to choose.

This isn't exactly a popular opinion around investment circles. I get it, gold sucks. It doesn't produce income, you'd be better in property, etc. I know the arguments. However, I think the anonymity that cash provides is often overlooked. Gold also provides this anonymity and if cash loses this anonymity(globally!!), then I believe we could see gold move much higher from here(over and above the rate of inflation!). 

From a sentiment perspective, there's a good argument to be made as well. Fundamentally, the story for gold has strengthened considerably(Attacks on cash) in the last few months, but gold continues to trade lower(since July). Also, combined with the fact that most people hate gold, it seems like a decent contrarian play.

Potential? To put this into perspective Rogoff estimates that the underground economy accounts for around ~10% of GDP in most developed economies(http://imgur.com/L7R4x4z). In the US (See chart) it is estimated that the underground economy accounts for 7.7% of GDP. If we take 7.7% of US GDP we have $1,256B(http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp). If we then estimate that 1% of that money will move to gold given an attack on cash(probably MORE) we have $12.56B. These are merely estimations, but it gives you an idea of how large of a move something like this could mean. Gold is the ONLY market large enough to allow for an escape from cash.

I'm sure there'll be several comments about bitcoins, but I have some security concerns and I think it would be too easy for governments to close the avenues of exchange(websites). Also, as mentioned above, I don't believe the bitcoin market is large enough.

Rogoff also makes the case against cash, because it would solve our negative interest rate concerns(If interest rates are negative, what's stopping people from sitting on cash under their mattress?). This may be a stronger case against cash( at least politically), than crime alone. Thinking about this now, negative interest rates would effectively kill the argument, ""Oh, but gold doesn't earn interest!""(At least for money in your bank account).

**TL:DR** The recent attacks on cash make a compelling argument for gold.",finance,1481578059

business,[Advice] Looking to do some grassroots fundraising to benefit urban children but don't feel comfortable routing funds to a personal account.,"Hello friends, 

First, I'm sorry if this isn't quite considered 'personal' finance as I'm looking for a way to fundraise for charity without putting funds into an individual account, but I'm hoping someone might have some info or suggestions for me.  

I, along with some friends and alums from my university, would like to do some paypal/gofundme fundraising to collect some money to buy &amp; donate toys to children in Philadelphia. We're from Temple University, a college that's surrounded by a neighborhood riddled with economic downturn, drug abuse and poor local management. We'd like to find a way to help and we want to open it up to other people in the city/community, but we're not sure how to do it.  

What we'd like to do:  

 * Set up a PayPal/GoFundMe account to accept donations from community members and university alums who aren't local enough to donate cash. 
 * Withdraw this money (using an online account is also preferable here so that we have receipts to show 100% of the money goes to the kids) and use it to buy toys, clothes, makeup, etc. for the kids in Temple's backyard. 
 * Have the ability to do it more than just once. There are some websites that will let you do a one-time donation that goes to a specific person, but it makes more sense for us - 'us' being the 4-5 people spearheading this project - to withdraw this money and spend it for what we need than for the 'recipient' of the funds to be a community member who isn't expecting it.  

What we can't do/don't have the resources to do:   

 - Start a non-profit. These aren't easy to make and generally take a record of donations prior to formation. Plus, at that, there's a limit on the number of organizations that donate toys to kids. We'd rather do it the small-town way than go full-blown IRS route.  
 - Link the donations to a personal bank account. I have no doubt that the 4-5 of us are trustworthy and would manage such donations responsibly, but I see two problems with this. First, I don't want someone to file their taxes and suddenly this is mistaken as 'income' that they then have to pay extra federal taxes on and second, it sounds sketchy to say ""please donate to Bob's account and *we promise* the kids will get the toys. By linking a donations website to a group-managed account instead of a single one, we can all have the access to see where every penny would go and in which ways the money is spent.  

A 501(c)(3) may be the end-result but we don't have the ability to do it at the moment. We'd also like to possibly expand this 4-5 person group such that we could sell t-shirts/stickers with profits going to the same kids we're trying to help now. I'm further reticent to link any personal accounts to anything involving donations because I've read that you can be denied 501(c)(3) status **years** after selling even one thing for 'profit,' even if it's a mistake.  

**TL;DR** we'd like to add links to our website for PayPal donations/GoFundMe listings and have that money go into an account that we can manage as a group without linking it to someone's personal financial history. Is this possible?

Thanks everyone!",finance,1481578370

personalfinance,What do we do about our mom?,"Hi PF,

I am a long time PF reader and commenter, but I created this throwaway account to anonymously ask for some advice.

My mother has spent the last 25 years, since my parents divorced, as a self-employed artist.  She has always had financial struggles, but one way or another found a way to keep herself housed and fed-- either through loans, windfalls (e.g. parents' life insurance), child support, etc.

Over the last 5 years, things have gotten harder. My sister and I both are over 21 and so she no longer receives child support.  After refusing to move out of her many-bedroom apartment for a few years, she finally took on roommates who have mostly covered rent.

Over the last few days, her cable/phone/internet was cut off for nonpayment (of a few months), hindering her ability to do business.  

It appears that her business is failing and she is in a pretty deep hole.  She has many tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, and with few people left to turn to, she is starting to ask from my sister (late 20s, moderate income, student loans).  She hasn't asked me (mid 20s, middle class, no loans) because I have made it clear that I am not interested in paying for her choices (e.g. not getting a job or moving out of her very expensive apartment 8 years ago when I moved out).   

She is very proud and has refused to use public assistance, nor to get a ""day job"".  However, with her circumstances looking more dire, I think it might be appropriate for me and my sister to enter the picture as a unified front, and change her living circumstances.  I am not opposed to paying some money up front to file for bankruptcy or get her set up. 

What do we do, and in what order? It appears she has missed December rent so this is a rapidly escalating problem.

tl;dr What are the steps to keep my mom off the streets?",finance,1481579272

personalfinance,"Work, save &amp; pay down debt, or debt-finance the last 2 years of school?","I'm finishing up my classwork in community college (first 60 credits), and I want to apply for [this program](http://SMCIXD.org). Its a bachelor's program at CC prices, in a high-demand field with starting salaries around 60-80k. It's a pretty interesting field too, and I'm enjoying the prep classwork for it so far. The question is, do I get a better handle on my current finances first, or go into a bit more debt in the hopes of dramatically increasing my income and starting my career faster? Here's some info on my current financial situation:

I'm 23, moving in with my GF, 22, this month. Rent is $1640/mo. for a 1bd apartment (its Southern California, that's a ""good deal"" for somewhere not in the ghetto around here). She's graduating with a B.A. next semester, and I'm currently in school. We both work service industry jobs - she works retail, as did I until a couple months ago when I found I could make basically double driving for Uber (the LA market is one of the only areas where driving Uber is that profitable right now). We're both looking into higher-paying gigs though, like bartending at one of the many craft breweries that are popping up like rabbits in our neighborhood. Here are some raw numbers:

- My Monthly Income (full-time): $2700-$3000/mo. (includes gas, vehicle depreciation, etc.)
- My GF's Monthly Income (part-time): ~$1000/mo. (she's going full-time in the next  month, expecting to double that figure)
- Our monthly expenses: ~$2800 (rent, utilities, food, cars, etc.)
- Debts:
Me:
&gt; $6k CC at 0% interest until June 2018
&gt; $1.5k CC at 0% til Aug. 2019 ($45/mo. equal-pay deal on a laptop for school).
&gt; $10k, 5yr auto loan at 15% ($279/mo, obviously high APR, but I needed a car and my parents are helping me almost entirely with the payments as of now.)
GF: none.
- Assets: I own my car (probably worth about $6k on the open market now, realizing I got mildly ripped off by the used car dealer. Live and learn I suppose.) Everything else is just electronics and a couple nice electric guitars I've acquired over the years. Everything is probably worth about ~$3k if I liquidated in on Craigslist right now. My GF owns her car outright, her family bought it for her in her name. Its newer with low miles, probably worth about 10k.
- Credit Scores: Me(670-710), GF(730-750)

In order to stop working full time and focus on school (the classes are only offered full-time), I would need to take out federal student loans to cover some living expenses. I've calculated that I would probably need about $1k/mo over 2 years, so $24k total. I'm still technically a dependent on the FAFSA until next year, so I doubt I'll be getting any grants this year due to my family's income, but that will probably change in 2018.

So, taking into account my debts, income, expenses, and projected income after graduation, does r/personalfinance think I should fast track my education with loans, or pay down some debts first?

edit: oh, and we both have about $5k in savings jointly.

edit 2: to clarify the financial aid stuff, I'm actually 22 right now - I turn 23 in a month, just said that was my age for convenience. So as of the 2017-2018 school year, I will still be a dependent on the FAFSA. I will be independent on the 2018-2019 FAFSA.",finance,1481584389
personalfinance,Which Vanguard plain IRA?,"I don't have anything saved for retirement.
I want to lower my student loan payments.  That's based off AGI (adjusted gross income in federal taxes).
If I stick money in a plain IRA, my AGI is lower, so my student loan payments get calculated lower, i.e. I get some IRA investment money back in the next year.
Vanguard looks ok.  Someone else mentioned it and it was mentioned on here.

So I set up a Vanguard account.  No money in it.

The target is a plain IRA.

Which one though?  That's my question.  

https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/mini/overview/0306

It still looks like I have to pay them to ""manage"" my IRA.  If that's how it is, that's how it is.  I'd rather pay nothing.  

Which one, if I have a choice, and what are my options for plain IRAs?  (I definitely don't want Roth since I want the lower AGI. That's the determining factor right now.)

I'm borderline age-wise, but I'm leaning toward being retired in 30 years or so.  I imagine the retirement age will increase more during that time.  Not that it's a huge deal though in terms of Vanguard's IRA plans. 

I'd also like my money invested back in the future.  That's the point.  I'm expecting it back with some interest.  (Although by the time I'm retiring I'll be in poor shape physically and maybe mentally, at least compared to now.  I might be dead by then too.  The only point for considering that is having liquid money now is more piece of mind, except I'm not earning interest on it now, so that's going to waste.)

Not married.  No kids.  No kids for sure in the future.  I'm kind of doubting I'd get married since is hasn't happened by now.  Even beneficiary-wise, the people I'll list are either going to be dead or could possibly be dead by the time this matures, assuming I'm still alive in this scenario.

So...
What plain IRA with Vanguard would you recommend?
Am I stuck paying fees with this thing?  (And those come out of the IRA itself, right?  I don't want to drop money in this and then have to pay from liquid money now too.)
Is it really just picking an IRA (if I have that option) giving them my bank account and bank routing info, and initiating a transfer?  That's it?  

And then after that I can basically forget about it.  Maybe check in on it at some point in the future, but it's not going to influence anything except that I've got some money stashed for retirement.  Still not enough though I'm sure.  As long as it works out, I'd do the exact same thing next year and for a few more years.  And if I get raise or promotion at work, I was thinking I'd just stick any extra money into the same IRA set up (or maybe a Roth or something a little different so it's not guided by lowering student loan payments).

What say you?
And is Vanguard really lower for paying them to manage my money for this?  I saw the site said that but you can't trust the salesperson.

Anything else I should take into account?  I'm thinking I might wrap this up before December ends.  I didn't shop or compare much in terms of picking a place.  Vanguard sounded ok enough.  Picking a specific IRA (if that's an option) is my goal for the rest of December.  And I think I do have until I file income taxes for Year 2016, but if it's on calendar year 2016, then it's 2016 for sure-for sure.  And this sounds like a very cookie cutter/known process.  

I suppose risky-wise, I want my money back in the future.  What are the chances or what has to happen for me not to get money back though?  I saw something about an all-in-one Vanguard IRA that's spread of top areas.  Essentially the US economy or country itself would have to crash for me to lose money?  Or something would have to happen right before I want to draw it out?  In a catastrophic situation money saved isn't going to be a great concern, and I imagine the entire planet would be worried if something happened to the US.",finance,1481586171

I've been thinking a lot about my upcoming financial options and I figured this would be the best place to ask. I am in a bit of an ideal situation for my age financially and I want to make sure I am doing the best for my future.

Since I don't have a lot of bills and already have a decent savings, I wanted to see what the best way to use this $1,750 would be.

* Current savings in bank account: $8,258 (.10% interest rate)
* Car payment: $383 per month (lease, so not worth paying off)
* Debt on credit card currently (paid in full each month): $253
* Monthly income: $1,000 (around $500 per bi-weekly pay)
* Student loan debt: ~$12,000

personalfinance,How Long Does It Take To Restore Completely Shredded Credit?,"Two years ago I lost my first good job out of college. During the three years I did work there after graduating, I managed to build a pretty good credit profile. I was making payments on two credit cards, two student loans, and a car. I would look up my 720+ score just to get a confidence boost. 

I lost my job out of nowhere, and, unable to find comparable employment, could no longer afford to make payments after my savings ran out. I sold the car and fell behind enough on my two credit cards that they went to collections, which I've continued to ignore. I managed to get a forbearance on my federal student loan, and have worked with Chase to make lower payments on my private student loan as interest accrues, so I've made those payments to keep that deal in place. In these last two years though my credit has hit rock bottom.

 I now stand to land a job at close to my last salary (~$40K, clear ~$2,300 per month), so I want to ask how to go about tackling this debt so I can restore my credit score quickly as possible.

Here are the debts:

Credit Card 1:
$6,600 balance; offer from debt collector to settle for lump sum of $770; to pay balance would be ~$180 per month.

Credit Card 2:
$2,200 balance; offer to settle for $1,100; to pay balance directly would be ~$65 per month.

Private Student Loan:
$22,000 balance; $90 monthly on current hardship plan; ~$180 minimum payment normally.

Federal Student Loan (In forbearance);
$28,000 balance; $0 payment now; ~$280 minimum payment under my new income.

So my first question is: once I start making money again, should I just knock out those credit card debts through the proposed debt collection settlements? They seem pretty reasonable, especially the first one, but I'm unsure of the implications of such settlements, and if taking them will further dent my credit. Also, the letters state they are only good until the end of the month. Will they still consider such a deal in a couple months, or be suspicious that I now have more income and demand more?

The student loans seem pretty self-explanatory: just resume full payments. At a combined $460/month, that's steep but not too bad if my only monthly debt payment -- but that's assuming my credit card settlements go through. 

So, with my credit now at rock bottom, if I abide by the above plan of settling and resuming payments, will my credit be relatively restored after 7 years? Or will the two cards in collections for almost two years be too damaging?

Fortunately, I can live with my parents while working this out. 

Any input appreciated! Thanks",finance,1481599146

personalfinance,Being recruited for the first time. What questions should I ask?,"Hi Guys, 


I am having a difficult time wrapping my head around this situation. 


Background: 
I’m a 27 year old male
Master’s- Organizational Development 
$68k in student loan debt (on income based repayment plan. Most loans are Fed rates)
No other debt. 
$10,500 in savings 

I do busines development for a small tech recruiting firm. I make $45,000 base with commissions on permanent placement and temp (contract) placement. In the last 8 months I’ve made about $4,000 in commissions and really enjoy my niche in the recruiting industry. However, my bosses are first time business owners and their leadership is subpar. I can already see the ceiling of my growth at this company, but I want to stay until I can make the money from the work and relationships I have worked hard to build. I have recently been contacted by a recruiter (a friend referred the recruiter to me) from a company based on the east coast. It’s a 50 million dollar tech recruiting company and they are trying to hire their first business development manager for my city. Here is what I would be doing: 

-Working remotely from home
-Servicing their 1 large client in my city (Master Service Agreements already established, job orders for positions pouring in)  
-The recruiter said I would be building out the organizational chart at the client then continue to bring in business in my territory. 

Here is my problem: The recruiter is flying out to meet me Q1 and I am trying to come up with a list of questions to ask about the role. 

My motivators: 
When asked what my base salary would need to be, I said $80,000 to make a move. Why? Because that’s what I believe my value is to a company and the glassdoor market average for my job is $79,000 (of course I didn’t say this). I’m also ecstatic about working remote. My last job was mostly remote and I was successful and disciplined enough to get the job done. I can’t work remote at my current job because the bosses want “synergy” (woof).  


Does anyone have any experience in this situation? What questions should I be asking? My entire career I have always applied to jobs and have never been recruited. This process is new to me. Thanks PF!",finance,1481601262

personalfinance,Drowning in Student Loan Debt!,"I graduated with a Bachelor's from the International Academy of Design and Technology-Orlando in 2007. As a single mother of 2 young daughters who was trying to get through the program while working full time, I opted to take all of the living expense checks that were offered to me to help make ends meet. It wasn't until about a week before graduating that I was called into my financial aid office to sign the exit documents that I realized the brutal sum of funds I had borrowed - nearly $100,000. Yes, I failed to do my homework and understand the results of taking nearly $30,000 in private loans on top of the $65,000 subsidized and unsubsidized loans and I've kicked myself many times for that. At the time, it was a matter of keeping lights on, gas in the car, and daycare expenses. (No, I didn't receive child support-unless you count the $40/child a month that was accruing against my ex while he was in jail back in Montana, where I previously lived, and ultimately fled, to get as far away from him as possible, but I digress.)

Anyhow, post-graduation, I had $30,000 in private loans at a 15% interest rate. Thank goodness for my parents who paid those off with a 2nd mortgage on their home. That left me with $65,000. I had a great job and was able to make the $650/month payments for 2 years, but then moved back home, got a good job, but the pay was much less. I had paid my loan down about $5000 in 2 years and owed $60,000 in 2009. I then opted for the income based repayment plan which significantly reduced my payments to a more manageable $250/month for about 2 years but then in 2014, decided to pursue a career in real estate (go figure-something that didn't require a degree). Some other life situations made it difficult to make the payment and I let a consolidation company talk me into their services. I had to pay them $29/month for the service but my payment was only going to be about $150. I was kind of at a point of needing any kind of relief and jumped into this without really understanding the implications. (Yeah, it's a reoccurring theme that I'm really trying to work on). Anyhow, back in July of this year, the consolidation company, Fed Loan Servicing, was requesting documents to renew my terms with them. Basically, if I wanted to continue paying only $150/month, I needed to pay them $29/month otherwise my payment would be assed at $580/month. (This is only the government loans - I pay $150 for the unsubsidized loans that couldn't be consolidated). I've basically been allowing the payments to be drafted monthly and haven't been reviewing my balance online (because it stresses me out!) but discovered that I owe $65,000 again. In other words, I have paid thousands but still owe what I did when I graduated in 2007 (minus the loan paid by my parents). In further inspection, I discovered that only $12, yes TWELVE DOLLARS, of my $150 +$29/month payment has been going to the principal. I've since told them what to do with their $29/month fee but am now paying $580/month. It's a move in the right direction and I've learned some brutal lessons, but FML. I don't want a handout, just some progress!

My question is, are there reputable consolidation companies I can refinance with? I feel like this company is predatory and don't want them to see another dime of my money. Is there anything I can do to get out of this hole of quick sand? I thought college would be the ticket to getting me ahead in life as a single mom and I can't help but regret it every time I face my student loan situation. Is there something else I could be doing? 

Side note: I just got licensed to sell health insurance on top of selling real estate. I had a great year in 2015 but this year has been significantly slower. I am highly motivated to work and always have done what I need to in order to make ends meet, but I need these student loans gone ASAP!!",finance,1481607401

Relevant details: My mortgage I only put 10k (5%) down. This is an in house bank loan and not through Frannie/Freddy or whoever, as an IC I would've had to wait 7 months more to buy a home but I have a connection to this small bank so I got a loan. I am not charged PMI. I would like to refinance once I hit 20% so I can get a lower rate and a 30 year mortgage to lower my payments with a big bank.

I am going to include as many details as I can but the general questions are

**1. After paying credit debt, do I pay off my mortgage to try to gain 20% equity to refinance a lower interest rate with a big bank, and use the freed up money to pay down debt OR do I pay down higher interest debt while continuing the higher mortgage payments at the slightly higher rate?**

**2. Do I withdraw my $2700 in a Roth IRA from a previous job to pay down the debt I choose**

**3. Where does an emergency fund come in? I've got about 7k in cash and $2700 in that Roth IRA. If shit hit the fan I live in a college town and can rent a couple rooms out in my house to minimize my mortgage, although I might do that either way**

The reason I am thinking about using it is because I have a student loan at about 10% interest with a principle of roughly 5k. My 401k is about 5k. I did find out i can only get about 50% of my total 401k loaned. 

My plan is to take out 2.5k to pay towards this 10% loan and then i would have a 2.5k loan to my 401k with a ~4% interest rate and 2.5k left to the original loan provider at 10% with the goal just to save the interest money.

I did read there are some downsides like paying back with post tax money and also the money i used for the loan would be ""locked"" i guess from generating interest, is this true? Even if it is true, the value of my 401k is so low that I'm not sure it would be a big difference.

I am based in Arlington, VA, not on our main campus in Blacksburg, VA.

I am in my second career at Virginia Tech. For my first career, I was a Special Agent and Senior Executive, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice for nearly 23 years. I had field investigative assignments in Indianapolis, IN, Los Angeles, CA early on (primarily national security investigations) and then mid-career in New York, NY (technical operations). I also served in the FBI (Forensic) Laboratory for 10 years as: a forensic biologist (crime scenes, method development and validation, casework lab analysis, reporting, courtroom testimony, providing training), research scientist (human DNA analysis), department head (biological, chemical, materials, physical sciences, firearms and explosive devices) and deputy director for science in the FBI (Forensic) Laboratory. For ca. 8.5 years, I was assigned to various positions in the Technical Investigative Program: as a technical operations planning officer (FBI Headquarters), engineering technology development unit chief (Quantico, VA), technical operations squad supervisor (New York) and deputy division director (Quantico, VA). I led the forensic and technical support to many major terrorism investigations and special events while in the FBI. 

I retired from the FBI in November 2002 and then worked for a Government “think tank” for two years. I have been at Virginia Tech since December 2004. I have extensive knowledge and with the development and operational use of science and technology as it relates to law enforcement, and national, homeland and global security, including at the interfaces of science and technology, operations, policy and law, as well as strategic program development and implementation. I have spent much of the last 20 years focusing on major events, terrorism, and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) terrorism and proliferation. While in the FBI I led the creation of the first—ever WMD forensic investigative program, which originated in the FBI Laboratory in 1996 and now encompasses a number of Federal agencies, national laboratories, universities and companies and collaborates with foreign governments worldwide and has many aspects to it. While in the Government and since from the university, I have worked with many Federal agencies with a variety of missions, foreign governments, and international agencies. I have served on a number of advisory boards and committees, including at the U.S. National Academies (study committees and reports on: establishing homeland security science and technology; advancing life science and technology and impacts on national and global biosecurity; nuclear forensics; improving the U.S. forensic science system; and, defense programs related to chemical and biological defense).

Currently my research and program development interests include: biosecurity and counter-bioterrorism; chemical and biological defense (including biosurveillance); advancing forensics and attribution technology, operational capabilities and policy relating to WMD (mainly bio); advancing general forensic science and policy; and understanding and developing solutions at the intersection of biosecurity and cybersecurity.
I have a B.S. degree from the University of Puget Sound, Tacoma WA, a M.S. degree in Botanical Sciences from the University of Hawai’i at Manoa, and a PhD degree in Plant Pathology from the University of Illinois, Urbana – Champaign.

personalfinance,"(UK) Overpayment of Personal Loan HSBC, what about interest?","Hi, I have a very high interest rate personal loan at HSBC UK, that I'm trying to reimburse as quickly as I can. The initial terms of the loans are: Initial Amount: £25000 Duration: 96 Month APR: ≈15% Monthly Repayment: £446.54 Total repayable value: ≈43000
As you can see, quite a big loan. I contracted it in June 2015, and have been paying the normal monthy repayment since. Recently, my finances have become better (better salary, less spending), and I have started to plan to reimburse it as early as I can. I made last month on overpayment of 2800£ (on top of my regular 450), and I intend to try to do an overpayment of 1400£ every month. It's hard but not impossible if I'm really diligent with my finances. Now, the thing is, when I made my paiement, I assumed the total repayable value would reduce by the extra-payment value and the interest of the extra-payment for the remaining duration of the loan. But my bank account only states the total repayable amount minus the extra-payment value. I'm a bit confused on how that works. Did I miss something or do my bank needs to update the value? Also, I have a sort of feeling, tell me if it's wrong, that it doesn't matter if I do overpayments now instead of putting the money on a saving account and closing the loan once I achieve the remaining capital. Is that right?
PS: as people will problably be curious as to how I came to contract such a loan, it was to buy back my student loan in France. When I got a job and a bank in the UK, my french bank didn't want me to keep my loan over there as I was not using the current account for my salary anymore, which was a breach of contract. Having this loan, my credit score was not good enough to get a better deal.

personalfinance,Telling my Nightmare Student Loan Story (update - debt free),"I'm debt free now, and just wanted to post how it happened, and some lessons I learned along the way in case anyone is interested.
A couple of years back, I posted my story on this subreddit (under a different name).
https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/2m5cx7/telling_my_nightmare_student_loan_story/

tl;dr of the story - I went into law school debt. 8.5% government rates. $200,000 balance after capitalization raped me. At the end of the story, the loan was at $161,000 and I was trying to dominate it.

It's all gone now. I made my last payment in early November 2016, and just received an email from SoFi (refinance company) congratulating me on paying it off.  I'm super happy, but have a sort of moral opposition to exclamation marks, so it might not come off that way.

Lesson 1: Law school is a gamble, especially when you're using debt to pay for it, and super especially when you don't pay attention to how much debt you're taking on. I basically took the maximum in combined Stafford and GradPlus loans, which had rates of 6.5%, 7.9%, and 8.5%. I still don't care to understand the meaning of ""subsidized"" versus ""unsubsidized"" Stafford loans. High interest rates = scam.

Lesson 2: High interest rates = scam.  In 2009, I was comforted that the government had taken over the student loan business. Unfortunately, the rates stayed high. Students have no voice in Congress because they have no money, so the rates stayed high, and a whole generation is getting fucked by its own government. Bailed out banks get access to &lt;1% rates, but students get the shaft.

Lesson 3: Be stubborn about paying off debt.  As a normal person, it's the only way you can guarantee ""winning"" in this society.  For me, there were no treats, no trips, no restaurants, no rewards.  When I got a bonus at work, I put ALL OF IT into the debt.  My inner monologue would tell me, ""you could have made 10% returns by investing it in a passively managed index fund you idiot.""  I would just say, ""shut the fuck up inner monologue,"" and keep paying.  My friends would say, ""come on this trip to Mexico,"" and I would say, ""sorry guys, I can't make it.""  Being a cheapskate sucks, but it's temporary.  If you really want to do things like date people and buy nice clothes, then by all means, go for it.  But find the deals and make friends with TJ Max.

Lesson 4:  Budgets don't work.  I tried to budget, and failed.  I choose blatant stubbornness and debt-hatred over budgeting.

Lesson 5: Be honest and forthcoming about your debt and repayment progress.  I told my friends.  I was upfront with girls I dated.  My family knew all about my progress.  It becomes ""the thing"" people ask you about, which motivates you to be stubborn about repayment so you can give an awesome update.  Girls understood too, but jeez, it's amazing the pressure I would get from them to ""treat"" myself.  ""You deserve to treat yourself,"" they would say.  ""Shut the fuck up girl,""  I would respond.  No, just kidding.  I drove a shitty old Toyota truck, and stayed in my cheap apartment (cheap for Silicon Valley is still retardedly expensive).  The pressure to buy a nice car or get a nice place was really high.  Judgment from others can be ridiculous.  Try your best to ignore it.  Rewards come later.

Lesson 6: Get help, but be reasonable. Don't be entitled to help. I was stubborn about paying, and refused help from my mother.  Eventually, I relented at the end of 2014.  The principal was still around $125,000, and I was making massive payments every month (over $3k per month + entire bonus checks).  I made a deal with my mother.  She had almost $80,000 in a savings account, and didn't know much about investing.  I made a deal with her to put that $80k to pay off my 7.9% interest loan (which had a principal of $80k.  In return, I set up a taxable investment account for her through Wealthfront (a great roboadvisor with 0.25% expense ratio), and have been automatically paying $640 per month, which was my loan payment for that particular loan.  It's made a 10% return and has almost $10,000 now.  Making 10% returns versus losing 7.9% is a no-brainer.  I will stubbornly pay into it until it reaches $80,000.  

Lesson 7: Refinance. The remaining $45,000 on my loans were at 6.5% interest.  I signed up for a 5-year, fixed rate option with SoFi, and got a rate of 4%.  This actually didn't matter much, since I handled this in less than a year.  Actually, I got lazy and started buying some nice things.  I got engaged and had to get a ring.  I went on some vacations.  So, it took longer that it should have, but it's done.  In any case, I should have probably refinanced earlier, and then done it again and again to keep lowering the rate.  I was stupid about it, but don't regret the focus on repaying.

Lesson 8: Buying property is stupid when you have high interest debt.  I didn't make this mistake, but have been in countless arguments with people about this.  Sure, the /outcome/ can be great, but you're just piling more debt onto your existing debt, and debt will always be a headache. Tell all your friends and parents and coworkers who think this is great advice to fuck off.  It's been ingrained in our thinking because the 80s and 90s were so good.  Property is different now.  It's more of a gamble.

Lesson 9:  Stick to the basics.  After debt, get the emergency fund up to five months expenses.  I'm currently doing this (I'd like to get it up to $40,000).  Pay at least up to your employer's 401k match.  Learn the 401k expenses (mine are stupid; around 2% in fees).  Don't max out 401k contributions if your plan sucks.  Select cheap, passive funds for your retirement accounts.  If your plan sucks, start a taxable investment account (I use Wealthfront).  The mental state here should be, ""contribute and don't worry about losses.""  Paying fees to some human advisor or financial firm is worse than taking some losses, because they get paid to lose your money.

Lesson 10:  You can't really time the S&amp;P 500, but you can sort of time the housing market.  If you're going to buy a house, consider the local market, and the fact that low interest rates and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve have artificially propped up housing prices (and stock prices).  It's not a good time to buy a house.  It's a sellers market right now.  It's going to blow up soon.  Trump is President for Christ's sake.  If you still want to buy a house, you'll probably lose money at this point, but go right ahead.

Lesson 11:  Financial literacy and responsibility have nothing to do with intelligence.  Some of my smartest friends and family members are horrible with money.  r/personalfinance was a game changer for me.  Thanks everyone :)",finance,1481636195
personalfinance,28 y.o. earning 34K and I'm in 13K worth of debt how do I get out of this situation?,"I'll say I'm using a new account because my other account has some doxxing information on it with the sub I post to. But I'll try to be as clear as I possibly can.

My situation currently is I'm living at home with my parents.  They told me specifically they do not care if I live with them and I don't have to pay rent, electric, food, or any of the major costs so long as I can cover my bills and I'm working full time. I've held a job every year out-of-school. Graduated in 2011 with a degree in liberal arts.  Right now I'm making ~34K with benefits, I have about ~15K in a 401K and ~$450 in a savings account with the bank.

Few years ago I foolishly bought a PC which I thought I could pay off (I didn't) but I never missed a payment, but now I'm stuck paying what was originally a ~2K debt (I splurged) which now has become a $4,372.69 debt on a Capital One card with 18.15% Interest Rate.

My student loans were going well I originally started out with 21K worth a debt.  I was working 2 retail jobs before 2013, making annually 28K and I was making the minimum payments.  Then in 2014-2015 I started paying off the loans aggressively.  I managed to get them down to collectively $8,706.26.  (I'll give a break down of each loan at the end I have 6 separate loans from Stafford/Unsub Stafford)

Before 2016 I couldn't drive.  Then I got a license.  I got a free car from my grandparents, who no longer can drive.  Unfortunately that car is 18 years old, and needs repairs ranging from the 2K-5K range.  Which I don't think it's worth repairing (although it has only 70K worth of miles on it).  My expenses each month are as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

CC Monthly Pay Off--$150.00

Cell--$118

Gym--$20

Entertainment (Netflix, Hulu, Paper, Spoitfy)--$51.02

Insurance--$151

Gas(I fill up once a week)--$100

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now on the New Year in February my car won't pass inspection because of the need for repairs.  I don't live far from work, but I do need a car of my own. I don't feel too comfortable having another $400+ bill with a loan, not to mention I'm guessing my Insurance will go up because it's a more expensive vehicle. 

Just a last few notes--I stopped paying my loan back in May/June because I couldn't afford the payments I was making.  For almost a year I was paying $600 dollars split between the Unsubbed Stafford Loan and the Fed Stafford Loan.  Since then I haven't been able to save money, because frankly I suck at being frugal.  I'm not sure what my budget should look like and I don't know what target I should be aiming to save.

Now my parents would sell me their house they said for $200K.  Now mind you we live in a city on the East Coast (won't say where) but $200K is completely undervaluing the property. But I don't see how I can save for a down payment for that house with the current debt I have plus the little amount of money I make. I'm currently looking for a new job, preferably one that pays in the mid $40K range within my field.  But until then I could use help with coming up with a budget because I'm not sure how to tackle this.  I would like to have my debts under control in a few years and I wanted to tackle this starting next year.

I AM 22.
 

I'm content with my living situation, but I live RIGHT at the edge of where I need to be financially, so each month I either make a little money or lose a little money. My income is quite variable, but thanks to my savings I'm almost always fine. I'm just curious what I should do to improve my situation.



I have a 2007 Corolla with 38000 miles, paid off.

Checking: $500

Savings: $9k

STUDENT DEBT: $32k 


(I just paid off my large 6.8% loans (I used to have 14k savings) and am now working on the second highest interest ones at 4.6%. All federal.)
Work: I am a TA at a college for 15-18 hours a week at $20 an hour, so I usually end up with between 900-1100 a month during the months that I work. (September-May)



My company, while doing well and being like literally incredibly stable, doesn't make much profit as most of what we make goes back into the company or is used to pay developers. It is a game development studio and we are sub 100k a year rn. Currently, despite having a lot more to ""spare"" I pay myself only $200 a month while we try to amass some savings for other projects (we're not doing great on the saving yet since our income is so low). If numbers here matter, I can post them, but otherwise I try to ignore the more variable side of this income if possible.



Overview: $1100-1300 a month during school months



I'll probably be working as an adjunct professor next school year (2017) making about 1.8x what I make now (4k a class and I'll be teaching at least two classes). Probably will make closer to 1800 a month at that point.


Expenses: 

Rent - $329

Car Insurance - $160

Parking - $67.5

Thoughts? 


Am I in a good place? I know I am probably ""safe"". I graduated summa cum laude, could probably pursue an industry job for money, but I am happy as I am, just wondering if there are CLEAR things I should be doing to be even safer with my current trajectory.


Notes:


Company is award-winning for multiple projects, but we were students, so we don't make a lot (mistakes, marketing, etc). I anticipate we will continue to grow, but we are trying to take it VERY slow. Goal being a stable outlet for creative works versus a giant money-maker.

Will likely teach at my university for a little while, but don't want a full-time position.

I have a tendency to want to buy expensive technology, but usually it's directly related to work, so my company buys it and we use it there (which fulfills my desires...sorta).

I am in my last semester of college and will be graduating in May at 23 with about 70k in student loan debt. The breakdown is as follows:

-$39,626 College Access Loan 4.5% (20 years)
-$7,250 Direct Subsidized 4.66% (10)
-$10,500 Direct Unsubsidized 4.66% (10)
-$14,004 PLUS 3.75% (10)
 *These are all federal or state loans

I am also serving in the Army Reserve and am expected to get 40k in student loans paid off through a contract incentive. I am estimating the actual number is going to be ~30k after taxes. They will only pay a maximum of 6k (before taxes) a year.

I got offered a job and will be starting that in January, working part-time pay should be about 2.4k per month.

Once I graduate and can work full time the pay will kick up to about 6-7k per month. (~70k a year before taxes)

I will have virtually no expenses because I am moving in with the folks to save money and manage debt better.

Should I prioritize saving over debt payments? If I do handle debts first, should I pay off the smaller figures while the army payments go directly to that 40k loan? Should I consolidate?",finance,1481645355
personalfinance,Frequently asked (and answered) questions,"Since we get new people coming through all the time, let's  highlight common answers to common questions.  (This is not every common question, just all that I could fit in one post.)  Many  of these are also discussed in the wiki.  

**I have $X000, what do I do with it?  What about $X00,000?**

See [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) for handling modest sums, these for [windfalls](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) / [investments](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing).  If you have no other better options, it’s ok to just put $X000 in savings; that’s relatively small as investment principal.  

**Can I afford this much rent?**   

A reasonable guideline for many people is 30% of your takehome pay.  If you live in a place with high costs, you might have to pay more, but then you need to cut back elsewhere, e.g. no car.  If you have very limited income, consider roommates, or renting a room in a house.  

**Should I get a credit card, and if so, which one?**

If you can pay off the balance every month without fail, then a  [credit card](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/creditcards) is a good way to establish credit for free.   If you don’t think you can / will pay it off, or you think you will spend unnecessarily, don’t get one.   The choice of card doesn’t really matter, they are largely similar.   If you have no credit, you might need to get a secured card as your first card.  

**Which debt should I pay off first?**

Make at least minimum payments on everything (since we assume you have no credit card balance).  To build wealth, make extra payments on the highest interest [debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt).   If you need cash flow or want to see progress, paying the lowest balance is another way to go that will cost you a bit more over time if it's not the highest interest.  

**Should I pay down my loans, or invest (more)?**

Yes.  Paying down loans is certain gain equal to the effective interest rate.  Investing is statistical gain at an assumed rate.   We [recommend](https://i.imgur.com/1rPEkGQ.png) prioritizing repaying loans with more than 4-5% interest given today’s economy.  Investing is historically better than paying extra on 3-4% mortgage/car/student loans in terms of wealth building, but if you just don’t like debt, then you can pay it if you want to. 

**How do I negotiate a starting salary?**

Find out what the position is purportedly worth in your local market on sites like glassdoor and payscale.  Focus discussion on your salary goals, not your current income.  Aim high if you are very well qualified or don’t need the job; don’t price yourself out otherwise.  More offers?  More leverage.     

**How do I negotiate a raise?  My co-worker gets paid more than I do.  What do I do?**

You’re not owed more just because of salary differences.  Look for ways to be more valuable, either to your current employer, or another one.  You might find it easier to get more money from another employer that doesn’t see you as being willing to work for your current salary.

**Is this online job offer / Craigslist transaction a scam?**

If you have to ask…  Any time  some Internet stranger wants you to send someone cash / western union / iTunes cards for some sort of “expenses”, it is a scam, whether or not they send you something that looks like a check, or a paypal transfer.

**How much should I spend on a car?**

You can own reliable basic transportation for less than $10,000.   You can choose to spend more, but it’s not financially the best choice; you’d do it for other reasons.  If you’re paying cash, then you are in a better situation to pay extra than if you have to finance the car.  

**What can I do if I owe more on my car than it is worth?**

You owe the balance on the loan no matter what you do.  You can trade / sell the car in if you can pay the remaining balance owed.  If it’s repossessed, you still owe the difference.  Continuing to make payments might be your best option until you have the cash to pay it off.

**What should I do about this old bill in collections?**

You can’t undo credit impact from [collections](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections) just by paying now.  (If you can get pay-for-delete, that would help.)   Creditors can garnish your income / levy your bank accounts if it’s worthwhile for them to do so, e.g. $X000+ debts to banks.  Consider negotiating old debt if you can’t wait for the statute of limitations to run out. 

**Should I buy a house?**

Yes.  I mean, no.  Well, maybe.  Do you want to live in the same place for an indefinite period, or might you have lifestyle changes / job opportunities that would change that up?  Do you have the income history / credit / savings to get a [mortgage](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/housing)?   Do you want to be a homeowner?  You don’t buy a house just based on monthly payments; you do so because owning a house makes sense for you. 

**I should buy the house anyway even if I think I’d move, right? I’ll just rent it out.**

That sounds better on paper than in real life.  If you want to be a real estate investor, buy investment real estate.  The house you don’t want  to live in any more is probably not your best real estate investment opportunity.  Being an absentee landlord is not for everybody, and maybe not for you.

**Where should I accumulate my money for a down payment?**

Put it in a savings account or equivalent for less than five years.  That’s too short to count on investment gains when your principal is at risk.  For longer term, use a taxable investment account, or possibly a Roth IRA.  

**How do I pay taxes on self-employment income?**

You owe [self-employment taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employed-individuals-tax-center) of about 15% on your next business income (after deducting costs).  Then you owe income taxes based on all your income and deductions.  30% or even 40% is not unheard of for total tax on self-employment income.  You can / should pay quarterly taxes if you are not having enough taxes withheld in other ways.  

**Should I cash out my retirement account?  I could use the money.**

If you have to ask…  This is probably a bad idea if you would owe penalties on the money, which is typical.  You often lose 30% or more in taxes if you cash out an IRA, and you lose future growth.  This would be a last resort if you have no other source of income.    

**I haven’t filed / paid my taxes in years.  What do I do?**

File your taxes, possibly with help of a tax accountant.  You won’t go to jail; the IRS wants your money, not you.  (If you were knowingly committing fraud, an attorney couldn't hurt, though.)  If you had money withheld, you might even get refunds for the past up to three years.   If you owe money, you would have to figure out how to pay that, perhaps with a payment plan.  

**Do I owe taxes on receipt of a large gift of money or property?  What about an inheritance?**

No.  Even if it’s more than $14,000.  No federal taxes on [gifts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/gifts) / inheritances of money / investments / property.  There are some very limited scenarios where you might owe state taxes, but you almost certainly don’t hit those, either.

personalfinance,Is living with family to save money worth the added stress?,"I'm 28 and a pharmacist making $130k a year with $400k from my undergrad and grad school student loans. Loans are beginning to come due (federal loans aren't due yet so I'm focusing on the private, higher interest loans and trying to save some money while still knocking out a few small loans in the mid-high interest rate category just to knock them out), so I'm looking for ways to save money. I can pick up shifts to make extra money as well here and there, but the main focus is going to be on spending less. 

I currently live in a one bedroom apartment for $1205 per month. Utilities and internet add $100-125. It's 7 minutes from my boyfriend, 20-25 minutes from work, 5 minutes from my best friend and her family, and 10 minutes from a dog park (I have 2 dogs). I also pay a dog walker ~$215/month to come take care of my boys during my 10 and 14 hour shifts. 

My aunt and uncle are buying a house 30-40 minutes away that would be only 10 minutes more of a drive from work, so the only time expense there would be driving down to see friends (the bestie has a baby so unlikely to drive up) and boyfriend (who would also be willing to come up occasionally and meet halfway as well). They have a yard and would watch the pups for free, and have offered to rent a room to me for much less than I currently pay for my place. All told, we're thinking if I lived with them, the savings would be about $1000/month. 

Saving $12k a year is pretty significant and definitely tempting, but I'm mostly torn due to adding distance to the boyfriend, which would probably be no big deal, and dealing with my aunt, who has a...strong personality. (For example, she tried to argue with me yesterday for 15 minutes about my hypothetical future wedding and her opinions about it...) She's sweet, fun, and I love her, but living with her opinions day in and day out isn't all that tempting. 

The extra money would be great for putting toward loans and/or savings; it's definitely the financially sound decision to make. However, is it worth it to lose my independence (I haven't lived with family for 10 years now) for what's essentially a drop in the bucket of my loans? 

The added distance from the boyfriend and friends doesn't affect me every day, but I do appreciate the convenience of being near them since in the past I've been the main one to drive to them (one person driving versus three plus the baby). My salary is based on 44 hours per week but I frequently stay late so my free time is fairly valuable to me; however it's probably not worth $12k. 

Therefore, the main question I have is: is it worth it to live with overbearing family to save money? Has anyone else moved in with family after a decade of not living with family? How much value can be placed on emotional savings versus financial savings? My best friend is saying it's absolutely not worth the savings, boyfriend and I talked about it vaguely (we'll probably discuss in depth this weekend but he's supportive either way) but my aunt jumped into it headfirst and is already telling people I'm moving in with her.

personalfinance,Financial Thought Experiment: Walter's real estate retirement.,"Here goes nothing: I am going to give my best go at laying out a theoretical real estate investment plan that would yield close to an exponential return. Feel free to dissect it and put your own take on it. This is primarily just a financial thought experiment. First lets meet Walter:

Walter is like any average american. Went to public secondary school. Attended a public university subsidized by federal aid. Went on to graduate and earn a modest net wage of $40k/year. Walter marries Skylar who's wage is similar to that of her husband's. Walter and Sklyer have worked hard to pay down their debts and have accrued 100K in savings over the years and now want to grow their savings by investing it in real estate. 

Walter and Skyler start really paying attention to the housing market in their area and the areas surrounding them. They finally find a deal on a 3br 2ba home in a nice area near a great school. They are a busy couple with their day jobs so they partner with a real estate management company who agrees to place tenants, collect rent, provide a level of maintenance, and evict tenants when needed for a 10% cut of rent. The rent is 1K/month

So now let's see how long it will take for their investment to yield a return. Given 10% to management and 15% to unoccupancy/maintenance/taxes (I am not sure of the average percentage to allow so 15% is estimated for simplicity) we have an average of $750 a month income or shall we say 12 years to reach their initial investment of 100K. Of course they could reach this 100K mark faster by reinvesting some of their expendable income but for this case we shall say 12 years. At this point you are wondering about inflation and housing market fluctuations which can be rather unpredictable at times. Given all external factors, this 12 years becomes rather arbitrary but we need to designate a number to keep our thoughts linear here. 

Now Walter and Skylar have another 100K to invest. What do they do? The same as before, same management company, same rate of return. $1,500 a month. 6 years or rather 1/2 the time to reach their original 100K investment. They now repeat this same process. 3 homes. 3 years 8 months to 100K. 

4 homes = 2 yr 9 months 
5 homes = 27 month
6 homes = 23 months
7 = 19 months
8 = 17 months
9 = 15 months
10 = 13 months
11 = 1 year
12 = 11 months 

100K in 1 year = +/- 34-38 years

Now the first home is 38 years older from when Walter and Skylar purchased it. They can renovate it, sell it, and replace it with a newer home. This can be done with any of their 12 homes. 

Walter and Skyler began this investment model at age 27. This 100K investment is now passively earning 100K/yr when they decide to retire. Now Walter and Skyler can buy that car wash.  

Yes, I know that there are over a billion factors that can affect this return model. It is neat to ponder though, given all external factors, would this return curve retain it's exponential properties? What are your thoughts?",finance,1481653613
personalfinance,"(US) Dear Personal Finance Gods - Trying to build poor credit with a needed car, as expected, interest rates are high and I have some questions.","Hello PS! Thanks in advance for the help!

After a much needed kick in my ass to start improving my credit, I have finally seen the light and want to start working on my shit score (480), I have mostly student loan debt counting against me from subsidized and unsubsidized loans which I have been working on. I've had a full time job, which pays about 18/hr, for about 3 years now. 

I need a car and have one I picked out after doing research on the type and dealership. I talked with them and this guy is honest and keeps really good care of his cars. I have one right now that I want to finance. So here's the deal:

Priced at 3450 I have set aside 1600 to set down. He knows that my credit is crap and said that he has two finance options (small dealership) One through the *Seaboard credit union* and the other (and he admits they are ""subprime"" loans) *Credit  Acceptance*, he tells me that they could go as high as 18%, but that neither will take less than 150 per month (totally fine with this, and I can definitely afford it). I have no kids, I'm not married, and I pay 600 bucks towards rent, I pay for absolutely no utilities -this part may be important- because I live in the guest room with my sister and brother-in-law, who really need the money right now. I only mention it's important because the guy who deals the car says I will need pay stubs and *utility bills*.

So to add another layer in regarding rent, this is something that my brother-in-law shouldn't be doing as it is in direct violation of his house loan conditions. I'm happy where I am and I know they need the help, someone mentioned that I could simply say I live there rent free which may be more attractive to the credit union. Is this true?

Is this amount down a decent enough amount to possibly get approved through the credit union? If not how much more would help?

Any other advice you could give me?

Communicating with Canadians about nuclear safety

Canada's nuclear industry is dedicated to transparency and proactive communication, but these are a shared responsibility among regulators, write Jason Cameron and Sunni Locatelli.

Transparency is important for increasing public understanding and trust in the CNSC's role of protecting Canadians, their health and the environment. The CNSC also believes that establishing an atmosphere of openness with the public should be a key priority for all national nuclear regulators, and that transparency and proactive communications are a shared responsibility among regulators, facility operators and international organizations involved in nuclear safety and security.

With a mandate to disseminate objective scientific, technical and regulatory information to the public, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), as Canada's regulator, goes to great lengths to ensure that it is being open and transparent in all of its dealings. The CNSC has worked to increase Canadians' awareness of our role, hear stakeholder concerns, share our knowledge and expertise, and forge partnerships with our licensees.

Better living through nuclear energy

Significant social and industrial development are fundamental added values that come when bringing in nuclear power to a country keen to advance, writes Luis Echávarri in an open letter responding to the cancellation of Vietnam's nuclear program.

After more than forty years of experience in the energy sector and as an expert in energy policy and especially in nuclear energy policy, I write to you regarding the recent decision to cancel the nuclear power program that Vietnam had been planning for several years. With full respect for the decisions that the Vietnamese institutions take on energy policy, I think it could be very useful to consider the added value that a nuclear program could bring to Vietnamese society.

Energy in the form of electricity is the foundation of economic and social development of all societies, and to establish an appropriate electricity infrastructure is an essential element in order to fulfill the aspirations of Vietnamese society for the future. International experience on energy policy implies consideration of balance between three basic elements: diversification, economics and environmental protection. Nuclear power is very well placed to satisfy these criteria.

Before you ask why it has taken so long please understand that my initial experience in resolving this on my own was so bad that I gave up. I admit my own fault in this and am open to any advice\constructive criticism. Just please don't lecture me because I know I've made poor choices.

I was 22 years old and wanted a new car. I had recently sold a car I had financed and because the buyer paid it off in full, my credit score was up to 792(ish). When I went to the dealership 6 months later they kindly told me my credit score was terrible and that I would need a co-signer based on my age and poor credit rating &amp; lack of credit history. I was shocked. My credit score was showing in the low 400s or high 300s. 

It turns out I had taken on 2 accounts that belong to my father that have now gone to collections. One was a small urgent care bill for $58 but the other was for a dance studio totaling $1485. The mistake and the given reason why Experian won't remove the bills is that my father and I have *similar* names. We have the same first name but spelled differently, we have different middle names, and we have the same last name.

Here's where things start going downhill ~ SO my car salesman recommends me a personal friend of his who owns a credit repair company. I called her up and she explains to me what is happening\will happen:

- Experian is difficult to work with

- She will write them a formal letter on my behalf quoting credit laws and formally requesting they be removed

- They are breaking some Federal Credit Law and there is a class action lawsuit where **if they refuse to remove the accounts**, I will receive roughly $1000 per violation (so $2000 total)

- If they do not respond positively to her initial letter, then her credit lawyer business partner will contact me and take care of the rest.

This all started out fine. I received a copy of the letter she sent and a copy of the reply from Experian that they were refusing to take down the charges. ""Okay fine, so this is where the lawyer will step in."" Wrong. I waited a month and never heard from a lawyer. Then I called the company back and was told she will contact him again. Another month goes by and nothing. I call her a 3rd time and this time she tells me they have parted ways from the first guy and that another one will be stepping in. This one is in my state (CA) and he responds right away. He asks me to send him various documents and the aforementioned letters. After another couple months I have received no contact. I called the company and requested a refund. I received no responses after that. I had been scammed and I gave up. 

One other time I was motivated and contacted a credit lawyer in the bay area. He seemed a little uninterested in helping me but he scheduled a phone-call appointment with me. I never heard from him on the date. I sent him another email with no response so again I gave up.

What I am asking today is for any advice on who I can talk to or what I should do to get Experian to remove these delinquent accounts from my name. 

**And thank you if you've taken the time to read all of that.**

tl;dr: not my delinquent accounts, experian won't remove them, scammed out of money, lost motivation to fix the problem

personalfinance,Saving for retirement VS paying of student loans,"26 years old, married. Started working at first job post-graduation as physical therapist with salary of $79,000 in mid August.
Student loans total $62,000 and are split into 3 groups: 

* $16,700 at 6.21%
* $23,700 at 5.41%
* $21,700 at 5.84%

I have the option to enroll in a 401k, but my employer does not match contributions at all, instead my company is an ESOP where I get 20% per year starting after working a year. I plan on working here 2 years max. However, they do offer student loan assistance plans starting Jan 1, 2017 of $600/month.

I also need to buy a car in spring of 2017 for my wife to complete her grad school, as she has to commute/move around during her final year. 

I currently have about $10,000 saved in the bank and had been making payments of about $2,000 per month into the loan with the highest interest rate.

I am not sure how best to proceed with saving for retirement versus paying down student loans. Is it better to maximize payments into loans and try to get rid of that debt as fast as possible, or divert more into retirement savings? I have considered a brokerage account for investing in stocks as well but that doesn't feel smart right now as I have no experience doing that.

Any help is appreciated, thank you.",finance,1481682080
personalfinance,"Financing first vehicle, wait it out or pull the trigger?","Quick background on me. I’m a 26 year-old with a yearly income of 56k and am currently still living at the rents with no rent as an expense (please don’t hate). I take home roughly 3,400 a month after taxes. I have a shitty credit score of about 560, mainly because I got a dui a couple years ago and couldn’t keep up on my credit card payments when the dui occurred because I had legal fees that were no. 1 priority. All my legal fees were paid off and I recently just paid off all of my credit card debt and other collection payments about 6 months ago. I wanted to give that information to provide a little more context into the predicament I’m currently in.
About three weeks ago when driving home from a family trip, the clutch on my 2008 Corolla went out. My parents bought the car for me back in 2008 and then transferred the title over to me but now it doesn’t have much value in it due to some depreciation on the car, a couple small body dents, the clutch being broken, and having 98k miles on it. The dealership is willing to give me $1,700 back for trade in value. With the condition it is in currently, with the clutch being basically gone as of now, it’s a pretty generous offer. The Kelly blue book value on it is about max $2,300 in good condition for a manual 08 Corolla. The lowest offer I’ve received on the repair for the clutch is about $1,000 - $1,200. Basically ¾ of trade in value and almost as much as the car itself at this point. So it almost makes no sense to repair it. I guess it’s time for a new car, right?
I wish it were that simple. Due to my shitty credit score of about 560 right now, my interest rate is going to be through the roof. The lowest rate I’ve received when shopping around was through Centris credit union, which is giving 13.2 for 63 months. On a $16,000 - $14,000 auto loan. So I have a few questions and sorry I’ll try and condense this it’s just a lot to explain because it’s a weird situation. 

1.	First of all, I was originally looking at a pre-owned 2015 Corolla with 1,300 miles on it at $15,100 and a 2014 Corolla with 27,000 miles on it at $13,800. The 15 sold last week but the 14 is still available. When I told the sales rep I’ve been working with a third party to finance the vehicle he told me he spoke to his sales manager and with the time of the year with all the dealerships holiday sales events and it being the end of the year / quarter, they are willing to drop the 2017 Corolla L down from starting point of $19,000 to $15,000 which is pretty awesome. I also want to point out that they’re willing to give me $2,100 back on the Corolla 08 on the terms that I make a purchase through their dealership. But my father also told me to at least go to another dealer like Hyundai and inform them of what Toyota is offering and see if they would offer you a 17 Elentra which has a longer warranty, same mpg basically, and lower starting price then the Corolla. All seems awesome but even putting $15,000 to $14,000 in a auto loan calculator at the rate I have with Centris it’s still a very large monthly payment for the caliber of car. 15k / 13.2 / 63 months comes out to be $331 a month. 14k / 13.2 / 63 months comes out to be $309 a month. The catch though about the Elantra though if they were willing to wheel and deal with me on lowering their price as well is that I wouldn’t be getting the $2,100 back on the trade in value of the car. So what in your mind would be the best bet? I would like to point out the estimated car insurance for full coverage with a $1,000 deductible on the Elantra is at $223 a month versus the Corolla at slightly higher $234 a month for the same coverage. The lower Elantra I would be paying around $540 a month for the car payment and insurance together. Yikes right? I could do all of this and have the luxury of a new car and have car payments that could really boost my credit score since I really need that and can’t get approved for credit cards currently. 

2.	The other option would be to pay the repair cost of the clutch of about $1,200 and drive it for another year or so. Once 2018 comes, I wouldn’t have to have a sr-22 for my auto insurance giving me the auto rate of a normal person. Also my credit score would most likely be above 600 which would drop the interest rate of an auto loan to about 6.6-6.9 which really does make a huge difference in the long run. I would also be making a little more annually at my current job which I have no plans of leaving for at this point. So is it worth to bite the bullet for the repair and wait it out till I’m in a better position to finance a vehicle or not? There would definently also be more maintenance cost on the car between now and 2018, I’m guessing probably $800 not sure. The other drawback of this scenario too is that I would definitely not really be getting much back on the car if I want to try and sell it for parts like I would now where I would get $2,100 back on trade.

I’ve spoken to my friends and family about this and it’s about 50/50 on what everyone thinks I should do. I need to raise my credit score badly but would need to sacrifice very large monthly payments which is possible since I don’t have rent now but I would be under so much on the loan in the long run. If I do the payment on the repair I take the risk of maybe not building my credit score up to 600+ by 2018 (even though I really believe it’s likely I would as long as I make on time payments) and dealing with more maintenance cost on the old car. It’s possible I could be in the same position a year from now worrying about the same scenario. Please reddit, give me some advice on what you would do if you were in my shoes. I think waiting it out is probably the best scenario financially but definitely not the convenient route. My parents seem to think I should just adult up and finance the car and then refinance the loan after a year when my credit is above 600. Thanks for any reply’s or advice in advance.",finance,1481683481

Effective February 1, 2017, Street Capital Financial will continue as Street Capital Bank of Canada (""Street Capital Bank"") and will commence its operations as a federally regulated financial institution.

Approximately four years ago, Street Capital Financial conducted a strategic review of its business as well as the Canadian mortgage regulatory environment and concluded that there was an opportunity to ensure its continued growth by becoming a bank.  Street Capital Bank will have the ability to access additional sources of liquidity, strategically positioning it to better support its current mortgage business, its planned expansion in this segment and future retail banking opportunities.

""The approval of our Schedule I bank licence concludes a four-year process for our company and represents a significant milestone in our long-term strategy,"" said Ed Gettings, Chief Executive Officer of Street Capital Group Inc. ""We are ready to commence the next phase of growth by building upon our enduring relationships with mortgage brokers and our base of over 130,000 valued customers. I would like to thank all of our employees, our senior management team, our board of directors as well as our professional advisors for their hard work, dedication, and guidance throughout this process.    I would also like to thank the application and supervision teams at OSFI for their time and dedication to ensuring Street Capital Bank will operate successfully within the Canadian banking regulatory environment.""                            

Following commencement of operations, Street Capital Bank is targeting launch of its new uninsured mortgage product suite in Q1 2017 which will be funded through GIC products distributed through registered deposit dealers. In the coming years, Street Capital Bank will focus its energy and capital on continuing to build its banking platform and plans to introduce additional retail banking products starting with the bank's credit card offering in 2018.

 ""As we enter our 10th anniversary, we are confident that the Schedule I bank licence will provide us with a significant competitive advantage as we continue to prudently grow our business,"" said Lazaro DaRocha, President of Street Capital Group Inc. ""Approval represents a validation of our operating model and the risk management practices we have applied since our founding in 2007.  With our capital base, the infrastructure we have built and the experience of our senior management team, Street Capital Bank will operate from a position of strength as it continues to execute on its business plan while generating revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders.""

I just started, but I'll be making 41k pre-tax.

For my new job in my new town, I need a car for the first time in 7 years. Unfortunately, I've got very little credit history. My credit score is very high (high 700s) from being an authorized user on two of my parents' cards, and for that I've been consistently ""pre-approved"" for some great interest rates through a soft pull of credit info. But I've been denied both for a credit card application and 2 auto loan applications due to insufficient account data to establish credit. I've applied for a secured card instead, but I'm not sure what I should do about the auto loan.

The car I'm looking at is ~15k pre-owned and, luckily for me, my parents are going to help me with a substantial down payment. That leaves me wanting to take out a $6000 loan that I'd like to pay off over 36 months in order to work on establishing my credit. The problem is, I can't establish credit if no one will approve a decent loan in the first place.

It seems like my options are to find a loan with a really lousy interest rate and go with that, or again, luckily for me, cosign with my parents, or take a 0% interest loan from them (they know I'm good for it). Would the latter options put me in a vicious circle of never building credit? Would it be better to work on building credit with credit card usage, rather than taking a higher interest auto loan if I don't have to? Is there some other option I'm missing?",finance,1481697604

With short-term breadth once again turning up today within the long-term up trend, tomorrow’s open is again an opportunity to jump on this scary bullet train of a rally as it continues to whoosh by.

Stocks from my nifty-fifty stock list giving new individual buys today were FIVN, LSTR, TRMB, and TWI. Others of note giving individual buys signals for tomorrow included FB, CMCSA, AMZN (might be an option play) and NFLX (ditto the option play).

But virtually all index ETFs, even though overextended, are in play on the short-term breadth signal — TQQQ, TNA, UPRO — for day trades certainly, and possibly swing trades for more than a day.

Much of the prospect for success on this setup will depend on the Fed Reserve decision tomorrow and the market reaction to it.  Just saying…

Yes, much depends on the market's reaction the Federal Reserve's rate hike.  And the reaction was down and as the market goes so go most stocks.

personalfinance,Odd student loan disbursement - who do I contact?,"I just noticed something weird on my student loans, and I'm not sure who to contact about it. I graduated from college in 2013, and have been paying my loans since (all federal). Throughout my college education, I took 2 disbursements per year for a total of 4 loans per year (2 subsidized and 2 unsubsidized). They were transferred from US Dept. of Education to FedLoan in 2012.

I was just going through my loan payment history (almost done paying them off, feels good!), and noticed that there are 4 loans that were disbursed on the same date, all for the same amounts, but they were added onto my account in different months. For instance, disbursement 1 was made on 11/28/12 with $1,320 subsidized and $2,847 unsubsidized and added onto my account in 11/12. Disbursement 2 was made on 11/28/12 with $1,320 subsidized and $2,847 unsubsidized and added onto my account in 1/13. This resulted in 3 disbursements for that school year.


 I find it to be INCREDIBLY strange, since the subsidized and unsubsidized portions of these loans varied at each disbursement as I was working full time to pay as much tuition as I could while in school. Every other disbursement amount is so wildly different from the rest, that the double identical disbursement on the same date is concerning.

Before my husband and I were in a serious relationship, he bought a motorcycle from HD with their financing at 22%. Awful. The principal balance is still $5,200 and we are throwing $500 a month at it, with $100 going toward interest.

Personal loan: I can get a 12 month $5,000 personal loan from my bank at 8.99% APR with ~$430 monthly payments.

New credit card: I am thinking about opening a Chase Freedom card which would give me 0% APR for 15 months. I could pay $500 a month and have it paid off in 10 months. Downside: possible credit score reduction due to carrying a balance/higher credit utilization.

We are both in very stable positions and are okay with our budget, so I am not concerned about being able to pay the loan, I am just sick of watching so much money go toward interest. In your opinion, which of those two options is the best, or is there an option I am missing?",finance,1481723142

btc,ELI10: Why lightning network (payment channel) will reduce bitcoin's value,"Suppose that two large exchanges bitstamp and kraken had established payment channel between them, this is the simplest and most frequently used lightning network

During a period of 24 hours, bitstamp sent 10000 transactions to kraken, each of them is 1 bitcoin. At the same time, kraken sent 10000 transactions to bitstamp, each of them is 1 bitcoin too

At the end of the day, those transactions cancel each other, so that the net result is 0. However, during this 24 hours, sometimes bitstamp sent more coins to kraken, sometimes kraken sent more coins to bitstamp, so the payment channel should be able to deal with the variance in positive/negative balance between them, let's say 100 bitcoin at maximum

So with payment channel, you only need 100 bitcoins to do all these 20000 transactions

What if all those transactions happen on-chain? Since each transaction need 6 confirmation to be sure, one bitcoin can only handle 24 trades during a period of 24 hours. With 20000 transactions, you need at least 20000/24=833.33 bitcoins. In reality, many coins would never get spent again after the transaction, so the real demand chould be much higher, maybe 5000 bitcoins

So, 100 vs 5000, you can see that with lightning network, the demand for bitcoin for doing transactions will shrink by magnitudes, this will definitely drag down the exchange rate of bitcoin, and cause all sorts of negative impact for the whole industry

Lightning network/payment channel is not only a technology, it is actually a monetary policy similar to QE: It greatly increase the money supply, thus should be considered carefully before even enter the inception phase",cryptocurrency,1481724774

personalfinance,"160K contractor income, no financial understanding. Need advice on how to tackle multiple loans, non-work 401k, and planning","Hello /r/personalfinance! I've been a lurker for a while and have checked out some of the reading in the sidebar but I still feel very lost and could use some direction. It seems my issues are more about my spending habits, budgeting, and general financial strategy, and I find that most of that stuff either doesn't apply or I don't know how to make it apply to me. I am a contractor in the tech industry and I am currently on a contract that pays a bit more than I normally would get at a rate of 160k/y. Normally I expect to make around 120k. They don't offer any sort of 401k match, and at the moment I am contributing nothing to a 401k. I have one or two 401k type plans (roth? ira?) that I contributed to in the past, but I switch companies so often, I am not sure how to combine those or how to bring those into any sort of use.  I don't expect to be at the same company for a very long time, so investigating a personal plan I can put into during the times I can't take advantage of an employer match may be a good idea, but I have no idea how viable that strategy is.

I have multiple student loans which I have only ever made minimum payments on. I think only one of them is a federal loan, as I have had trouble consolidating in the past.

Loan #1: $12,000 @ 6.88%

Loan #2: $18,000 @ 4.8%

Loan #3: $5,000 @ 2.1%

Loan #4: $10,000 @ 1.5%

I have personal loans/debt too.

Prosper Loan: $5,600 @ 8.32%

Car Loan: $11,500 @ 5.98%

Credit Card $8,500 @ 0% (Until July 2017, 22% afterward)

My poor spending habits (which I am working on) have not let me chip away at the above debt, but now I have excess cash in spite of that and I need help making a strategy. Do I just pay the highest percentages first? Is there a point to paying the quick wins to allocate those monthly payments into another? Should I open another CC (temporary 0%) to move some of the debt? Is there something I'm fundamentally missing?

I fear I am not diligent enough to use ynab, and my Mint account is out of date as I have not used it in quite some time, but I am trying to get back on track. I feel I should be putting away for a savings and a 401k but I am not sure where to start, or if that even makes financial sense if i have this much credit card debt.

personalfinance,Stopping 401k contributions in favor of eliminating debt and saving money to open small business. Good or bad idea?,"Good morning,

I am faced with a difficult decision while preparing to quit my full time government job and open my own small business mid-2017. The decision is whether or not to submit my TSP election for 2017, and if submitted, what % of my pay to continue allocating into the TSP.

For those who don't know, ""The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal employees and members of the uniformed services, including the Ready Reserve. It was established by Congress in the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 and offers the same types of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their employees under 401(k) plans.""

Some info about my current financial situation:

*27 years old; credit score in the 700s

*Full-time government employee making $67k. By March, a pending promotion will effectively raise salary to $80k.

*I have been contributing 10% of my pay to my TSP since 2009. Current balance is a total of $37k spread across 3 index funds. 46% C Fund, 38% S Fund, 16% I Fund.

*$7k in personal debt (spread across two CCs)

*$0 in savings/emergency fund

*Have side business which brings in $500-2,000 a month but is volatile

Also just put $1k retainer on business lawyer and pending the quality of their first deliverable, plan to consult more with them before opening the business. These costs are out of pocket for me right now, but are being recorded as startup expenses for the business, so if all goes as planned I will recoup this.

I also have $17k left in student loan debt which my generous parents are currently making monthly payments on. However, I have not told them about my business venture yet and I do not feel they will support me because of the industry it is in. My student loan debt is currently spread across three loans in which the monthly payments are $125, $55, and $42 ($222 total). I may have to begin paying for this myself at the time I open my business in the middle of next year.

So, with all of that said:

My idea was to actually elect to raise my TSP contributions from 10% to 15% this year. Because of the pending $13k raise, this seemed as good a time as ever to make the increase. Right now, the 10% I am contributing equates to just over $250 each pay period, or, $500 each month. My employer matches 40% of this.

I then considered the huge risk I am about to take in ~6 months opening my own small business. This is especially risky since I have no savings/emergency fund and a considerable amount of outstanding debt. By my calculations, I will have the $7k of personal debt paid off by March, April at the latest. At that point, I feel an emergency fund will be necessary and I would like to start fundraising on top of that (if possible) by saving my own money so that I can reduce the amount of outside investment needed and retain the most equity possible in the business.

Basically, my goal is to be free of the $7k personal debt, build an emergency fund ($10k), and then continue to save money on top of that to help open the business. This is all at the expense of forfeiting my TSP contributions. I figure if I stop the TSP contribution, I can funnel that $500 (or more) into a savings account until the business opens. That way I should have at least $6k in savings/emergency funds by mid next year. I should be able to pay off the $7k personal debt by March/April as mentioned just continuing doing what I'm doing. However, I'd likely just be aggressive with this debt before starting to save. And this way, if my parents choose to stop making my student loan payments, it will be my only debt or expense outside of normal living costs.

Now I will no longer be able to contribute to this TSP once I quit my job any way, so with the above reasoning, I don't think I'm harming myself too much by stopping right now. Tell me if I'm wrong though, or just give your thoughts on this situation. The 40% matching I'm losing definitely hurts but I'm trying to be as risk averse as possible opening this business. With debt, no emergency fund, and potentially no income, if the business fails I'll be in a very bad situation.",finance,1481732154

personalfinance,"27, $48K income, $10k debt, $1.9k/mo mortgage","Hey PF, 2017 is upon us and I want to start budgeting and investing correctly but I'm a bit confused and was wondering if you guys could point me in the right direction.

I'm single and I recently changed my job (starting 2017). With my current job (2016), I set up a SIMPLE IRA with 3% match. It currently has $2k in it. I guess I'll have to talk with my current employer and my employer in 2017 if I could transfer the SIMPLE IRA over right?

For my new job (2017), I'll be making $48k/yr before taxes and in (2018) I'll get a raise and will be making $60k/yr. I have about $10k worth of student loans left. I already paid off the ones with highest interest rate (6.7%, 6%, 5%). The rest of my loans currently ranges from 3-4.5% interest rate. 

I also recently acquired my parents mortgage and I'll be paying $1,900/mo mortgage; 20 years @3.25%, owe $270k on $270k loan.  

How should I approach this situation? I want to start an ROTH IRA and start investing. 

Summary:   
Age:27  
Income: $48k/yr   
Loans: $10k student debt @3-4.5% interest  
          $1.9k/mo mortgage @20 years, $270k left  
IRA: Simple - $2k  
       Roth - None  
Savings: $16k  
  

EDIT: I forgot to mention, it's a 3 bedroom house and my parents and I are currently living in it. My parents will help with some of the housing expenses but the plan is they'll move out once everything is settle down and I plan on renting the remaining 2 rooms out ($1k per room) to help with the payments.

personalfinance,"Company's odd 401k policy, is this normal?","I work as a federal security contractor for a major security firm in large metropolitan area on a contract with over 200+ other officers. As a federal contractor I receive a health and welfare stipend of $4.10 an hour for the first 40 hours worked on top of my normal hourly rate. This money can be used towards the company's very overpriced health insurance plan or toward a 401k account. I chose the 401k account as do most of the other officers.

What I find odd is that the 401k account that is used to manage the health and welfare fund is entirely seperate from my 401k account that I deposit my pay deductions into. Different investment firms and investment options and I have very little control over it. 

What I also see as strange and in my opinion very sketchy is that my company ""holds"" all health and welfare money for 4 months until they deposit it into the 401k account leaving the employees 4 months behind while they collect interest on the fund. When they do deposit the money it shows up as an ""employer contribution"" but the stipend is considered part of the employees earned pay.

Even when an employee quits or is fired they have to wait 4 months until their 401k contributions finally catch up to try to roll it over.

Something about the whole process just seems fishy to me or is this normal and I'm just over analyzing it?",finance,1481736545

personalfinance,I have two retirement accounts and no employer contribution. Should I roll them into one? Which one?,"My employer does not offer any retirement options whatsoever. I have two retirement accounts from previous employers and I am lost on what to do with them, if anything. Here are the quick facts:

- 27 years old
- $60,000 salary
- No credit card debt
- No car payment (but driving an older car which will need regular maintenance)
- Only about $600 in monthly bills including rent
- Currently have student loan balance of $6,000. I recently returned to school and am taking out student loans to the tune of $10,000 a year for the next 2 or 3 years. I have been making payments of $100 a month against these student loans. Interest will not accrue on these loans until I am out of school and the interest rate looks to be 3.76%

My retirement accounts:

- Merrill Lynch 401K from when I worked at Walmart. I have not contributed to it since I left in 2012 but it has grown 10% this year on it's own. Beginning balance on January 1st was $4,500 and today it is $5,000. The total fees for the year are only $12.29

- LPL Financial Simple IRA current balance of $7,700. It shows an ""Unrealized G/L"" of -2,077. So it looks like I've been losing money on this account, although I understand you should contribute to your IRA over your 401K. I have not contributed to this in a year - when I left the old company. I was focused on paying down debts first and now I want to make sure I'm saving/investing wisely.

Should I roll over either account? Should I leave them be while only contributing to my IRA? I would like to contribute about $500 a month while throwing the rest into savings.",finance,1481739553

investing,Canadian banks are fucked.,"The recent rise in Canadian banks doesn't make sense in the Canadian banking environment. Interest rates that are falling(2 rate drops last year) and a housing market that is significantly overvalued by any metric mean banks have a lot of headwinds. Debt levels in Canada are also higher than in the US in 2007 and the Canadian banks are severely under capitalized because of the CMHC. Arguably, the CMHC will save the bank from collapse, but they can't help earnings when they eventually plummet.

The bank of Canada has a very difficult decision moving forward, because they're dealing with a falling $CAD while housing is getting ready to collapse. Either they raise rates to protect the dollar and kill the housing market, or they lower rates to protect housing and kill the dollar.Thoughts?

personalfinance,[Debt] Credit Union Loan vs. CarMax Loan,"Yesterday I got pre-approved for an auto loan from my credit union of up to $15,000 towards the purchase of a new car. After scouring most of Central TX my wife has made our decision on what to buy. Last night she called up the CarMax dealership to buckle down a time for us to go check it out. The person on the phone guaranteed us he could get us a better interest rate on the car if we go with their banking institution instead.

My credit union's loan would be at a rate of 3.55% if I went with them. The CarMax person said they have gone as low as 1.6% in the past, and swears he'll be able to beat the 3.55% rate already offered up by my banking institution. At first glance this seems reasonable enough, but today I'm starting to have doubts.

My credit score is currently 692, and after the CU ran my credit report yesterday I can expect it do drop (not sure by how much or how soon though). If CarMax person wants to run my credit again I'll see it dip down more, am I right in assuming this? 

IF Mr. Max does run my credit and CAN find a better rate for me should I take it? What, if any, is the difference between taking a loan from a CU as opposed to one offered through a dealership? Should interest rates be my first, only, or last priority when considering loans from different institutions?",finance,1481742785

I am in a bit of a pickle.  Im 29 years old and am a 3rd year resident (out of 5 + 1 to go), and no matter what company I try or how long i spend on the reconsideration lines I cannot be approved for a credit card.

 I make about 62k a year and have approximately 285k in medical student loans (mostly federal) which are in financial hardship forbearance. I have a single credit card with a 1200$ limit and an astronomical interest rate that I obtained nearly 7 years ago before medical school. I have tried to have the limit increased and was denied now twice despite not having a single late payment in that time. I also have tried to apply for a new card and was also denied. The stated reason is obligation to income ratio. I have checked my credit reports and aside from the student loans my record is pretty spotless 

I have about 3k in savings accts and direct nearly 15% to savings/retirement.  I am hesitant  to take some out of of that stream to make payments to loans and to do it out of discretionary income would really make my budget tight given the IBR and PAYE are pretty darn high and cost of living isn't cheap here in the slightest. But even then i dont even know if making payments would let me qualify anyways.

gaming,You Can Train Trico With The Blue Barrels [Last Guardian],"So, Trico loves these big blue barrels, and through some experimenting, and me being stupid and not recording any data, I was able to conclude that giving these barrels to Trico after he performs a command that you ask him too, makes him more likely to perform that command. Like I said, I didn't record any data, thinking that there would not be a difference. I was wrong. AI is too good. Despite not recording any data, my 3 playthroughs varied significantly. In my first playthrough, I just fed Trico the blue barrels at random, like any normal player would. Second, Only fed Trico Barrels after Trico performs the task that I wish. Third, Tried to feed Trico as little as possible. Trico did not like me feeding Trico as little as possible. Trico no longer gives a fuck about your life if you feed Trico as little as possible. *""Catch Me Trico!""* **No.** I noticed a decent difference in Trico's Behavior when I fed him barrels after he does what I want. The difference when you Feed trico as little as possible is ridiculous. Do Not Feed Trico As Little as possible.

TLDR: Trico is your pet. Only Feed Trico after he does what you want. That way Trico will start to learn that when he does what you want, he gets food.  

Sorry, I had to throw this together real quick. I had a study hall this period and I procrastinated on deciding to write this post.

personalfinance,Paying off Mortgage vs Investing in ETFs (x-post from personalfinanceCanada),"Hi All, entered this on the Canadian sub where I had answers all over the place, thought I'd ask here too!

I have been thinking about asking this for a little while now. 

I'm 30 years old, married, with a baby on the way. I am at a job where I'm around 100-120k per year, and I feel like I'm stuck between a choice to pay off my mortgage (condo), or try to jump into ETFs and Index funds to try to beat the interest rate on my mortgage. Not actively looking to move out just yet, as we figure we can stay in our condo for another 2-3 years with a small child on the way. 

Here is what I'm working with right now:

130k in Scotia Powersavings
10k chequing

50k coming due in February 2017 from a Scotia market powered GIC (global) 

10k in various stocks with Questrade

45k in TFSA (maxed)
60k in RRSP (maxed each year, matching with employer, why leave money on the table)

3 years left on 5yr lock in with mortgage amortized over 25 years, 2.20% rate... reasonable payments,with about 180k left on the mortgage.

So I'm hoping for some guidance, I'm generally a fairly risk averse investor but this might be an opportunity to pay off the mortgage, on the other hand there is value in keeping those chequing and savings funds freed up in case we found a new construction home that we'd like to put a down payment on. Should I look into investing those funds into ETFs over the next few years to see where we're at when the mortgage is up in year 5?

personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans (federal and private)?,"Hey all, just started following the sub and have already learned a ton so just wanted to start off by saying thanks to all of you for being amazing. :)

So, I was recently approved for a refinancing of my student debt from SoFi. The grand total would be $88,353.57. 

$21,677.57 is in Federal Loans - multiple loan types, different interest rates on them ranging from 3.15% - 6.55% Currently I am on the income based repayment plan and paying $247.25 a month. I made a lot more money this year however, and expect that to go up quite a bit once I submit my taxes for 2016

$66,676.00 is in private loans with a variable interest rate of 6%. Currently paying $652.80 a month.

SoFi is offering me a FIXED interest rate of 6.74% which will be reduced to 6.49% when I sign up for auto-debits. The payoff is a 15 year term at $781.36 a month. That would be a finance charge of $52,291.23.

I guess in the short term, what's appealing about this to me is that my total monthly payments on my student debt would instantly go down. It's at about $900 currently. I also like the idea of locking in a fixed interest rate so in case the economy crashes, I don't have to worry about my interest rate going up.

My big concern is giving up my federal loans and switching them to a private lender which takes away any opportunity to switch payment plans or have any of that debt forgiven. 

Right now I'm leaning towards refinancing. I would use the extra money that I'm saving monthly to pay off a bit of credit card debt and my car, and then start driving Uber to more aggressively pay down the new lump sum. There are no penalties for early payoff.

I realize this is a huge commitment and would love to get some thoughts before I make a decision one way or another.

Thanks everyone. Big hugs and kisses to you all!",finance,1481761856

personalfinance,"2012 Maryland tax lien, but was living in DC","​I have an unusual tax situation and would **REALLY** appreciate any thoughts, input, or guidance you may have. I am very much in over my depth.

I just found out that the state of Maryland has an exorbitant tax lien against me for unpaid taxes in 2012 (they had an extremely out of date address, which is suppose why they didn't contact me any sooner).

**Background**

In 2012 I moved multiple times between Maryland and Washington DC. I worked in Washington DC as a waitress. Because I didn't know any better, I paid my federal tax and filed DC taxes. For my DC taxes I paid ~$273 on top of the ~$1.2k they took out of my paychecks. I did not file Maryland taxes.

**My conflicting addresses at the time**

Maryland

* Address A was on my driver's license and Dept of Education paperwork. This is the address that the state of MD was assuming I lived at when they put the lien on me.

* Address B was on my 2012 federal and DC tax return because I had just moved in

* Address C was on my DC &amp; federal tax returns because I had just moved in when I filed

DC

* Address C was on my W2 for that year and for the previous two years

* Address D was on my tax paperwork from my university


​​**Today**

I called MD to ask about the tax lien because I had no idea what it was about. They told me that I need to send them a 2012 return at which point they will take 4-6 weeks to decide how much I owe them. Because this is such a convoluted mess, I would really love it if anyone could share some wisdom about navigating this situation.


**My questions**

* Should I create a 2012 MD tax return and send it along with my 2012 DC return? Would sending my DC return prevent me from getting double taxed?

* If I get double taxed, is there any way to get my DC money back?

* Because the lien is about 3x more than what I probably would have owed (guessing maybe $1.2k?), could I negotiate with the state to pay less? I could pay $1.2k out of pocket if I really needed, but if I have to pay the entire lien as is ($3k+) it will take me a long time.

* Is it worth trying to prove that I actually lived in DC and thus would not owe MD taxes? I could use my W2 and school paperwork to prove the point and I would just say that MD was my mailing address (which was mostly true because my dad lived there).",finance,1481765476

However, how does this work for a bond fund, e.g. AGG? AGG's price has been dropping due to interest rate increase concerns. But, since rates are going up does that mean that the new bonds the fund buys will lead to higher dividend yields, therefore buffering the fall in the ETF price?

personalfinance,Got married and need to return my Roth IRA contribution. How best to use $5500 before April,"So, I added 2500$ to my roth earlier in the year, got married, and liquidated post-tax stocks to add another 2000$ and max my yearly contribution. I then read income limit for IRA's for my filing status (married filing separate) was capped at $10,000, not $100,000 as i first read. Luckily, I can withdraw the cash from my Roth with very little penalty. But it still means I have $5,500 sitting around. I could just stick it back into the post-tax stocks it was in before, but i want to do better. I have about 40 years until retirement. 


My first question is, if i file taxes in April and declare married/file separate, are all 2016 contributions suddenly void or do i only count as ""married"" for my 2017 earnings? What about the contribution from before the date on the marriage license? I was legally ""single"" when i made that transfer and well within my tax bracket... 

So, I have looked at a few options but am hoping i missed something, so please point out any mistakes. 


1) Backdoor conversion from IRA.
I could stick all $5,500 in a traditional IRA (not income limited) and roll over into my Roth.  Since I already paid taxes on that sum, it should be a free rollover right? 
Well, apparently that traditional IRA gets lumped together tax-wise with the 401K from work even though it's held in another bank. If i read correctly, that 5,500 I want to contribute post tax would be averaged against another 15k Pre-tax in the 401k and I would have to pay taxes on ~75% of any rollover, or almost $1000 in state and local taxes even though the entire 5,500 is post tax. The long-term value of this 5,500 is actually greater than the upfront tax bill (despite paying taxes twice), but i think i'm missing a better opportunity. 

2) Backdoor from my 401k
By the above logic, 100% of the rollover is taxable as it all comes from pre-tax paychecks. But at least i haven't already paid taxes the first time on this money, so it's half the true cost of option 1


3)Just max out my 401k contribution through the next few paychecks and stick the 5500 in my wallet to cover. An enticing option (and probably the best?) but according to calculators, the Roth would have outperformed by 7k over the next 40 years due to the taxes on earnings.


4)Invest the money in a regular brokerage account with no tax protections- easiest option, but even fewer long term benefits.


5) I have an HSA. Can I and should I just lump all that money in the HSA and deduct the income or do all HSA contributions have to come out of my paycheck?

personalfinance,"Student, 6k CC Debt, Living Paycheck to Paycheck and trying to save for a ring, possibly looking for a raise","To start off, please forgive me if this is scattered. I've been so overwhelmed the past few months I don't even know where to begin.

I'm 20, and been going to a public university, but next semester I'm enrolled at a CC for 1/7th the cost of the UNI. I work part time, making about 1k a month. I'll get back to that.

I've made some mistake during my first couple years of school. Failing classes and generally just not caring. I've started to turn my life around but could use some advice on some areas. I'm sitting at 35k of student loans, 25k of which is from Sallie Mae, all is in deferment since I'm still enrolled.

I've got about 6k of Credit Card debt between 4 cards with 2 of them being above 2k each. I've got two cards enrolled in the InCharge debt management program, and am about to add a third which will be 90% of the debt in the program. The program lowers the interest rate, and closes the accounts. 

My set-in stone expenses are:

* $360 a month in rent

* $210 car payment

* $150 Credit Card Payments

* $60 a month in utilities

* $35 Motorcycle insurance

I can't really change those, other than increase them.

I'm lucky in that my parents still pay for my car insurance and my phone bill, so I've yet to inherit that expense.

I basically live with my girlfriend, though she has her own studio. My actual roommate will be leaving after this year and my girlfriend and I will move in together. My rent may go down about $100 as my brother may also move in, but that won't be for another 6 months.

I spend about $40-50 a month in fuel, as I drive a Honda Civic and I don't need to drive it much except to class and back, and even then over the summer I ride a bike that I own completely.

I find myself living paycheck to paycheck, even some months not being able to make ends meet. My biggest killer right now is probably food, I eat out a ton. I tend to spend even more if I go to the grocery store, as my girlfriend always goes with me and we spend way too much on food we end up through out.

Right now I work M,Th,F and every third weekend, I work on an on-call basis after hours. During the week, I am on call from 4:00pm-8:00am the next morning. On the weekends I work, it is 24 hours both days. I get paid $2/hr that I'm on-call, and $11.5/hr when I actually receive a call, and they don't stack. I average about 72 hours per week of being on call, because I normally pick up an extra Saturday or such on weekends I don't work. I average 15 hours a week of actually being on a call.

Starting January, I will hopefully be on call M/W/T/TH/F and rotating every 2nd or 3rd weekend due to my scheduling change. I've worked here for going on 5 months, and I love it. I get my own company car to go to calls on, and I get a company phone as well, so I don't have to drive to work at all in my personal car. I never got a 3 month performance review, as my manager is actually based a couple hours away. She just said I was doing great; I constantly take calls an hour or more before I'm technically on call, and I always work to go above and beyond. My end goal is full time employment with the company.

I have been toying with the idea of asking for a raise for quite some time, and was hoping to do it at the 6 month mark. but I've never asked for one before. Is this something I should pursue? 


On to even more! My girlfriend, who graduates this year and will be working full time as a teacher is planning a Florida trip for next summer for the two of us. She is planning on using inheritance she has been saving for awhile, though if we go I will have to go half in with her. I have some money in an account, maybe about 1k, that is from my grandparents that I was hoping to use for that, as our total budget is about $1400.

I'm planning to propose during the trip, and that bring another problem; money for a ring. I don't even know how to afford a cheap 1k ring. I've been thinking of selling things I own, computer, even the bike, but nothing I really own would bring in THAT much cash. It's worth a ton to me, but nobody would pay what it's worth to me. 

I've thought about picking up a daytime job next semester, but that would mean I'm either at class, at a dayjob, or on call for my main job. I feel like I know myself, and I know I would end up becoming burnt out and drop classes.

I can't even sleep any more, guys.

We would love to pay off our student loans but we are more focused on our immediate credit card debt right now. After taxes we both make around $3,700 a month.

personalfinance,"10k in debt before 18, interest rates are insane","So basically a certain family member helped me by cosigning for a car loan with me. Great! Well this certain family member decided to go out and buy the car without me being present, and upon their return I learned that the car needed some serious motor work (Like a complete rebuild $$$).
Enter Family member #2, who said that they would help me, financially, to get my car up and running because I was unaware of the mechanical problems at the time of purchase. The total rebuild cost of the motor and trans on the car came to about 10K, which of course we put on a credit card to cover the cost and make payments with time. All sounds good up to this point I guess, until I learn that certain family member #2 was making those credit card charges all while being unemployed and not having any income whatsoever; so therefor the interest rate is absolutely insane for the payment - $300/mo, whereas only ~80 of that is going to the actual principal, leaving of course ~220 just in interest each month.
My name is on the car title and lien-holder agreement, I have no connection (physical, name, billing info) to the credit card.

My question is: what course of action can I take here? for the longest time I thought that ~$300 of my money per month was being applied to a card payment and I recently learned that only 80 of it is. I'm basically paying 30k for a 10k debt because I was not informed of the rates I would be paying for this whole ordeal.
Am I really expected to be held liable for paying that interest rate and balance total even though there was no communication of the rates/capitol/principle to me? Also note that I can't refinance the loan into my name because my credit is shot due the certain family member #2 having a joint bank account with me and writing bad checks ALL THE TIME. I don't even qualify for a loan (personal/auto) greater than $1k at this point in time.

Ultimately I would like to dump the car, dump these payments and get into something a bit more practical, but I'm concerned that I am just stuck with these payments and the car at least until I can sell the car, put a big dent in the card balance, then try and pay that off ASAP.

Since this is my first post ever, I would like to express thanks to anyone who takes the time and reads into my story. Any insight at all is appreciated!",finance,1481819034

401(k). IRA. Roth. Defined Benefit. Defined Contribution. 457. 403(b). Social Security. TSP. When it comes to pensions, there is a lot of terminology out there and it can be intimidating for  workers to wrap their head around it all. My goal with this post is to provide a comprehensive look at understanding what a pension is, what commonly used terms mean, how one kind of pensions differs from  another, how they are funded, who bears the risks, and to look at current trends in the pension landscape. I wanted to write this up because as a frequent reader and contributor to /r/personalfinance I’ve seen over time a large number of questions in this field coming from all age ranges, from the fresh college graduate wondering about the benefit and investment choices at their new job to the soon-to-be retiree wondering if that lump sum payout they’re being offered is the best choice or not. [The wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index) touches on many of the topics I’m going to talk about – namely 401(k)s, IRAs, Social Security, Roth contributions, and the TSP, but I’d like to examine those plans in the context of pensions as a whole.

*What is a pension?*

The first pension plan in the United States was [started by American Express in 1875]( https://www.ebri.org/publications/facts/index.cfm?fa=0398afact). Participation bloomed over the next century, and by 1970 over 25.3 million private-sector workers (45 percent of the private workforce) had some type of coverage. In 1974, Congress passed the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act) which still today provides many of the regulations and provisions dictating how pensions are run. 

Traditionally, the term ‘pension’ refers to a type of employer-sponsored plan that makes monthly cash payments to a former employee of that company when they reach retirement age. The amount the retiree receives is dependent primarily on their salary and tenure with the company. The more the retiree earned and the longer they worked at the company, the higher their monthly payment would be in retirement. This type of plan is known as a **defined benefit** (DB) pension, because the benefit that the retiree will eventually receive was defined based on a predetermined formula known at the outset of employment. This type of pension was the first to be created, and was lucrative to employers because it allowed them to effectively pay employees less today on the promise to pay larger benefits in the future. It also allowed employers to pay benefits with future earnings from market returns, freeing up current cash flow for investment, both real and financial. To properly fund these plans, companies would invest cash today into the markets, allowing the compounding returns on those investments to, over decades, pay for benefits in the future. In order to calculate how much money should be invested today to meet those liabilities, actuaries use an assumed rate of return on pension investments known as the **discount rate**. The higher the discount rate, the less money needs to be invested today because investment returns are expected to be higher. The lower the assumed discount rate, the lower the returns from those investments, requiring more upfront cash from the plan sponsor to meet future obligations. In 2015, defined benefit plans paid out $688.8 billion in accrued benefits, while taking in $784.2 in contributions almost all of which came from employer contributions and investment growth.[^1]( http://bea.gov/iTable/iTableHtml.cfm?reqid=9&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;903=392)

Today, the term ‘pension’, while still used most commonly to refer to a defined benefit plan, also can refer to any payment from a tax-advantaged investment account which a worker has contributed to during throughout their career for the purpose of providing income in retirement. In contrast to the defined benefit plan described in the previous paragraph, recent pension activity is shifting strongly toward **defined contribution** (DC) plans which make a fixed dollar or percent-of-pay based contribution to an investment account each period, and allow that investment to compound over the employee’s working life. However much money has accumulated by retirement age is what the retiree has to draw from. They are known as defined contribution plans because the amount of money that will be contributed to an employee’s retirement account each pay period is based on a defined formula at the outset of employment. In 2015, defined contribution plans paid out $520.2 billion in accrued benefits, while taking in $621.9 billion in contributions. [^3](http://bea.gov/iTable/iTableHtml.cfm?reqid=9&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;903=397)

All pension plans can be classified according to which of these two methods they get their funding from. Every other term you hear to describe a pension – IRA, Roth IRA, 401(k), 457, Social Security, etc. – takes the form of one of these general concepts. The differences between them lie in who is eligible to enroll and their tax implications.



*Understanding Risk*

Before we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of different kinds of plans, it’s important to understand which parties carry the financial risk in defined benefit vs. defined contribution plans. Recall that in the prior section I mentioned that pension activity is shifting in favor of defined contribution plans. Why is that? Primarily, it’s because under a defined benefit plan, the employer bears the unknown risks related to investment performance, employee lifespan, and tenure. These costs should not be underestimated. To illustrate, imagine yourself as an employer. You want to attract top talent, but can’t quite afford to offer competitive pay this year. Instead, you give them promises; promises to pay them many years in the future after they leave your company. You won’t even be CEO anymore in 30+ years, what do you care what happens! Until money is set aside for these promises, the employer has what is known as an  **unfunded liability**, meaning they are carrying the expected outlay on the balance sheet without having allocated any money to actually pay for it.

[Facts in the following paragraph are drawn from: https://www.illinoispolicy.org/reports/pensions-101-understanding-illinois-massive-government-worker-pension-crisis/]  

A real world example of the risks to the employer under a defined benefit scheme recently occurred in Illinois. Over 1 million municipal and state workers were covered under a myriad of some 667 different defined benefit plans. A number of factors contributed to the crisis including generous benefits approved by state politicians, full retirement benefits being offered to many workers in their 50s, an annual cost of living adjustment of 3%, and a low-rate of employee contributions into the system. To make matters worse, rather than fund these large obligations at appropriate intervals, Illinois’ politicians often used the money that should have been contributed to the pension plans as a political slush fund instead, spending the money on other uses. By 2015, the collective aggregate unfunded liabilities had climbed to $111 billion. The money needed to prop up these funds now consumes 25% of Illinois’ budget, compared with an average for other states of only 4%.

By contrast, under a defined contribution scheme, risks are shifted onto the employee, and some, like tenure risk, are eliminated altogether. The major risk facing workers in these plans are that market performance will be the determining factor in how much money they will have available in retirement, and without a long career of consistent contributions, it’s unlikely that it will be sufficient source of money to support dropping out of the labor force.

*Social Security*

**Social Security**, officially “Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)” is the United States’ public pension program which was enacted in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Social Security shares characteristics with both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The defined benefit features are that the monthly payments one receives are determined by their earnings throughout their working career and when they choose to begin taking benefits. The defined contribution features are that the amount paid into the program each paycheck is a fixed percent, determined by law. 

Social Security is funded by taxes on both the employer and the employee. The total tax is 12.4%, split into 6.2% for each party. Self-employed persons are responsible for paying both halves of the tax. There is a cap on the amount of earnings subject to this tax, and [that limit is $127,200 for 2017]( https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2017.pdf).

In order to begin collecting Social Security benefits, you must be at least 62 years old. This is known as the early retirement age, and if you choose to begin collecting benefits then you’ll do so at a reduced rate. Full retirement age, when the normal benefit can be collected, depends on when you were born, and has been gradually increasing over time due to new legislation. For those born between 1943 and 1954, the full retirement age is 66, rising to 67 for those born in 1960 or later. It is possible to delay claiming benefits even when full retirement age is reached, and the benefit will increase by 8% for each year, up to age 70, that it is deferred. [^3](https://www.nasi.org/learn/socialsecurity/retirement-age)

Taxes paid into Social Security are used to pay current beneficiaries. Any surplus collected is added to the Social Security Trust Fund which is then invested in special United States government bonds, backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. By law, the trust fund cannot invest in any other type of financial asset, both to ensure the preservation of capital and to prevent the type of destabilizing effects on financial markets that would occur should $2.8 trillion suddenly become available for investment. In 2015, Social Security took in $920.1 billion in revenue and paid out $897.1 billion in benefits [^4](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4a3.html), for a net increase of $23.0 billion to the trust fund. Due to demographic shifts in the United States, including [a fall in the fertility rate]( http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-us-population.aspx) and the impending wave of retirement of the baby boomers, the net effect on the trust fund will soon be negative. Since 2007 when the fund grew by $190.4 billion, each year has seen decelerating growth. Based on current trends and assumptions, it is believe that the trust fund has sufficient assets to pay out [100% of promised benefits through 2034](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TRSUM/2015/index.html) If the fund is depleted, the Social Security Administration says it will be able to pay approximately 75% of promised benefits using current-period tax collections. 


*Defined Contribution Plan Types and Their Tax Treatments*

This section will cover the most common types of defined contribution pension schemes. Two of the most important factors to look at are the annual contribution limits and whether contributions to the plan are made with pre-tax or post-tax dollars. 

Pre-tax plans, such as a traditional 401(k), are beneficial when you anticipate being taxed more highly today than you do in retirement. For example, if you are in the 28% tax bracket now, earning $150,000 per annum, but anticipate an income of only $75,000 in retirement (the 25% bracket), it would make sense to contribute as much as you can today to lower your tax burden, and only the lower marginal rate in retirement.

Post-tax plans, by contrast, such as a **Roth Individual Retirement Account** (Roth IRA) allow today’s net income to be invested, grown, and withdrawn without having to pay tax on the gains. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than you are today.



Plan Type | Contribution Tax Treatment | Withdrawal Tax Treatment |  Annual Elective Deferral Limit | Eligibility | Comments
---|---| ----| ----|----|----
401(k) | Pre-Tax | Taxed |$18,000 (under age 50), $24,000 (over age 50) | Anyone with an employer-sponsored plan of this type | Contribution maximum applies to the sum of 401(k) &amp; Roth 401(k) plans (See Next).

*The Power of Compounding*

The following tables assume that someone works from age 22 until retirement at 65. Each contribution amount listed is fixed for the entire span, compounded annually first, then adding each subsequent year’s contribution. This is conservative (versus adding the next year’s contributions first then compounding), and will tend to underestimate the actual returns in the scenarios listed. Dollars amounts are pre-tax and are listed in current dollars, not taking inflation into account. These are to illustrate the importance of contributing at a young age to your retirement accounts



Annual Contribution Amount | Market Returns % | Amount at Age 65 | Amount at age 65 if contributions started at age 30 instead
---|---|---- | ----
$1,000 | 3% | $89,048 | $63,276
$5,000 | 3% | $445,242 | $316,380
$10,000 | 3% | $890,484 | $632,759
$18,000 | 3% | $1,602,871 | $1,138,967



Annual Contribution Amount | Market Returns % | Amount at Age 65 | Amount at age 65 if contributions started at age 30 instead
---|---|---- | ----
$1,000 | 5% | $151,143 | $95,836
$5,000 | 5% | $755,715| $479,182
$10,000 | 5% | $1,511,430| $958,363
$18,000 | 5% | $2,720,574| $1,725,054

Annual Contribution Amount | Market Returns % | Amount at Age 65 | Amount at age 65 if contributions started at age 30 instead
---|---|---- | ---
$1,000 | 7% | $266,121 | $148,913
$5,000 | 7% | $1,330,604 | $744,567
$10,000 | 7% | $2,661,209 | $1,489,135
$18,000 | 7% | $4,790,175 | $2,680,442


With 7% returns, a historically achievable figure, anyone who can invest merely $5,000 a year from age 22 will become a millionaire by retirement age.

*Today’s Value of Tomorrow’s Money*

As employers continue to transition away from defined benefit schemes, there may come a time when they want to clear those obligations off their books and will offer a lump-sum pension buyout. If you should find yourself in this position, you need to know if it’s better to take the lump sum or hold on to your existing benefits. To do this, we need to calculate the Net Present Value of our steam of future income.

Our hypothetical worker Jennifer is a 45-year-old woman employed by Boeing, earning $75,000 per year. She has been with the company for 15 years, but is thinking of leaving in the next year or two to look for new opportunities. Boeing calculated their pension benefits as 1.65% * Average Monthly Salary * Years of Service less 1.5% * Social Security benefit * Years of Service [^5](http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/companyoffices/empinfo/benefits/pension/spd/spd_114.pdf). For Jennifer, assuming her salary has been constant over the last 5 years, she might be looking at a monthly benefit of approximately (0.0165 * $75,000/12 * 15) – (0.015 * 1900 * 15) = $1,546 - $427 = $1,119 upon reaching full retirement age, which we’ll call 65 in her case. Because Jennifer is 45, she knows she can expect to live another ~38 years[^6]( https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), to 83, giving her 18 years of retirement. From this we can already tell that her total expected payout is $1,119 x 12 x 18 = $241,704 pre-tax, but we need to convert that value into today’s money. First we use the present value function:

    PV = Payment * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r 

where Payment is the total annual payment, r is the discount rate (rate of return) that we will assume, and n is the number of years of retirement. We will assume a conservative 5% rate of return. With this information we have a present value of PV = $13,428 * [1 – (1 + 0.05)^-18 ] / 0.05 = $156,968. Finally, we convert the present value to the *net* present value of the pension back to our current age using:

    NPV = PV / [(1 + r)^n ]

n in this case refers to the number of years until retirement, 20. This gives us $156,968 / [(1 + 0.05)^20] = **$59,159**. Note that with the rate of return in the denominator, a higher discount rate means that the value of the pension is lower. This makes sense because if that money were available to us now instead of in the future, it could be invested earning a higher rate of return.

With this information, if Boeing approaches Jennifer with an offer to buyout her pension, she can compare it with the $59,159 net present value and see if their lump sum offer is competitive, or if their offer should be declined. Of course, the value we’ve calculated assumes we know exactly how long Jennifer will live, which isn’t guaranteed, nor are the expected market returns. If Jennifer thinks she’ll live longer, the pension becomes more valuable. If she thinks she won’t make it to the life expectancy, the lump sum becomes more attractive. The important thing to take away here is that with these formulas you can tinker with the inputs to get to your level of comfort and discover the optimal solution for your needs.

personalfinance,Lost my scholarship and my parents are refusing to pay for my education after this school year finishes,"When I first enrolled in school, I wasn't really in a good place emotionally or mentally, and my grades suffered tremendously. I started out with a full ride scholarship, and I lost it after 3 years. My state (LA) pays for the tuition at in-state schools through 4th year for students who have demonstrated academic merit, and I received this state-provided aid. My parents have been covering the difference between what the state pays and my actual cost of attendance. However, I am currently in my 4th year, and at the end of the current academic year this aid will end. My scholarship cannot be returned to me even though my grades have improved over the last couple of terms. Additionally, my scholarship would have ended at the end of this academic year anyway.

I'm on a 6-year plan because I faced some trouble making academic progress my first year and a half due to my emotional and psychological instabilities, but I'm making steady progress now and have been for a while now. I'm in my 4th year and I'm taking all junior level courses.

I have two years of college left after this one, and I will be paying for my education 100% full price. There will no longer be any state aid, and like I said, I lost my scholarship earlier this year with no chance of getting it back.

As of now, the full cost of attendance at my university is $20,406/year. That includes tuition, fees, room-and-board, books, supplies, and ""other expenses."" My parents have outright refused to continue to pay for my education, and my dad has explicitly said, ""I will not cosign with you for any loan."" My credit is average (FICO ~650), and I have pretty much 0 savings. I currently work at an on-campus job making $7.50/hour, 15 hours/week (we're not allowed to work above 15). I've always been a medically inclined person, so I sent my application to the state Board of Pharmacy to get my Pharmacy Technician Candidate Registration. It would allow me to work as a Pharmacy Technician at any pharmacy in the state until I qualify to pass the PTCB exam and get my full certification. The reason I applied for this is that the local Walgreens is hiring a Pharmacy Technician and typically pays them about $12-15/hour.

How can I take care of all of my expenses? I can probably live with a friend for somewhere around $400/month and split utilities and Internet for somewhere around $50/month and $35/month, respectively. But then I also have to somehow budget food, gas, and (most importantly) paying for my education.

Oh yeah, I also have 0 student debt, but I do have a few (5) credit cards (totaling around ~$17k) that I'm hoping to put a big dent in this summer by working full time.


How can I handle all of this?


EDIT: Currently, federal loans would let me borrow up to $7,500/year with an aggregate limit of $31,000.

EDIT (for clarity's sake and this is probably pretty important): My 6th and final year I will not be full-time. I have made sufficient academic progress such that my 6th year I will only enroll for 4-5 hours/quarter (8-12 is full time, beyond 12 you need special approval). As a part time student, my tuition and fees will drop tremendously (from ~$2,950/quarter to ~$1,500/quarter).

EDIT: I'm studying electrical engineering so with some luck I can probably make around $10k with a summer internship.

**EDIT:** I've read over all of your comments. I racked up the debt by buying stupid crap I didn't need but wanted. I recognize that my poor decision making coupled with my impulsiveness and lack of self control got me where I am. But I am ready to change. I am planning to tackle all of my credit card debt first and then worry about school. With the mountain of debt that I am facing, I will not quality for any private student loans. Therefore, I have to clear myself before I even think of hitting that ""Apply Now!"" button. Have I made some stupid, idiotic decisions? Yes. Have I been a completely irresponsible adult? Yes. But I'm not doing that anymore. I literally **cannot** afford to do it. My parents will allow me to move back home and live with them and have all my living expenses covered by them. They just don't want to pay for my living expenses elsewhere. So I can live with them and work full time. If I live with them and work full time, I can settle ALL of my debts easily under a year. I'm deep, **deep** in the hole, but I don't have to be forever. I will not be forever. I'm changing myself, and I am taking responsibility and getting my life under control.

The Fed will raise rates another 3 times in 2017. Mortgage lenders probably have this priced in and thus it's possible mortgage rates will reflect this (especially if people will be financing their homes across 15/30 years).

personalfinance,Best way to repay student loans? Can ask to lower payment based on income and pay more towards higher interests instead?,"Hello, I'm a recent college grad and it's making me dizzy trying to figure out all of this stuff.

I have about 45k in student debt. It's all direct subsidized and direct unsubsidized. My payments are about $500 a month, which is a week's pay for me. I can only afford this because my parents are very supportive - I live at home with them an they cover most of my living expenses.

I have two sets of loans at 6-7%. I know I should try to pay these off first. If I consolidate my loans, they use a weighted average, and since I owe the most on those two, it only drives up my rates in the long run. I'm sure that's not a good idea.

My big question is, can I ask for an income based payment plan and then pay extra towards the bigger loans?

I'd like to continue to budget $500 a month towards my loans. I'm sure that my income will warrant a decrease if I ask for it. If my payments were lowered to $300 a month, I'd like to direct that extra $200 towards the loans with higher interest rates.

Is that allowed? Or are they going to turn around and say if I can afford to pay extra I could have afforded the original payment?",finance,1481830442
personalfinance,Need advice for 2017.,"I am a 25-year old singer and college student. I go to a decent public Liberal Arts University in New England, where I am working on my Bachelor of Arts in Music. I have 38k in Federal Student Loans, and an additional 23.5k in Parent Plus Loans. 

In my late teens and early 20s, I suffered from severe anxiety and mental health issues. Luckily I never engaged in self-harm, but I was on psych meds that had such drastic side effects that made community college and working part-time a difficult thing to do successfully. I graduated in 2013, and transferred to the school I attend now. 

I love music, and I always have. Out of fear, I switched to Business  at community college and did horribly. I switched back to Music and graduated with a 2.29 GPA. Hooray!

I never got the opportunity to study music in detail until my early twenties, and when I transferred to the school I am at now I had a hard time learning Theory and Piano at first. I am also still a beginner as far as vocals. I feel I am improving, but I have incredible anxiety regarding my career future and finances. I don't have a car and commute two hours each day I have class, which makes working many hours difficult. I took a year off from college in November 2015-August 2016 to work in a bank and get experience in something outside of retail and music. 

I am so lost and I don't know what I should do after this semester. Happily, this is the best semester GPA-wise I have had since I started here, and I am expecting my 2.41 GPA to rise to about ~2.65. But since I don't have much support from family (never really did, my father is in jail) I am very conflicted.

He received an offer in the mail, from a card he had paid off a month ago, for 0.99% interest until 04/1/18.  There would be a 3% balance transfer on each $6,500 which is $390, if my math is correct.  One card has a 9% interest rate and the other has a 15% interest rate.  The card with the balance transfer offer has a current credit limit of $12,300.  He is thinking of asking for a credit increase on this card in order to do the balance transfer.  Is this a wise idea to do?  I know that the request for increase will hit credit report however, paying 0.99% interest for almost a year and half seems worth it.

personalfinance,Refinance rental property vs Invest $100000,"Hello Financial Wizards, I have a situation as follows:

I am nearly complete with a property subdivision that will allow me to sell off a piece of land that was previously one piece with a triplex on it. I purchased it with an owner-occupied single family mortgage (4.375%, current balance of $335000, loan matures 02/44).  I lived in it for a few years, started to use it as a triplex (legally and as it was originally built) and then moved out.

I plan to sell the new vacant property and expect to have nearly $100000 in cash after taxes, commissions, etc.

I am considering refinancing the rental property to remove the mortgage insurance ($338 per month). It will be on the loan for the life of the loan no matter the loan to value. The only way to remove it is through refinancing. I am estimating the upfront out of pocket costs to be $40000-$45000 for the refinance.

I also have another rental that I can pay down to 80/20 to get rid of MI, which will be around $20000. (Saving me $150/mo)

**Would I be better off financially to invest this money someplace else?**

Things I've thought about:

I don't know what interest rate I will get next spring/summer when the land sells. Unlikely that it will remain at or go below 4.375%.

I will need to move back into one of the units or I will have to refinance it as an investment property with a higher interest rate.  Which also means I will miss out on at least $5400 in rent (three month min). Plus that's a hassle my spouse will probably not enjoy (neither will I)

If I keep the mortgage insurance on the triplex I will pay nearly $110000 on the life of the loan, but the flip side is I can deduct this from my taxes  (my AGI should be remain under the current $109000 for the foreseeable future) .

Thoughts?  

If I don't refinance, what are some good options? I will be maxing out my 401k, contributing another $13000 to a tax deferred and $6600 to a Roth 401k.

So first off, thank you!  
  
I've seen a lot of discussion around married filing separately for couples in my situation--I have a significantly higher-paying job ($65,000), no debt, my SO is an artist and so the income is much lower ($20,000), and has about $70,000 in federal student loans. Currently, under IBR, he pays nothing, so it seems like married filing separately would be the way to go to ensure those payments don't skyrocket.  
  
So far in my searching, I haven't quite seen this question answered, though. Let's assume his income doesn't change significantly over the next 20 years, so he never pays on the loans, and at the end of that time, it is forgiven. Let's call it $200,000 in taxable income. Obviously that is a big tax bill, but we have 20 years to prepare for it.  
  
Is it possible that it's a better financial decision to not pay down the loan, but instead invest that money in something relatively stable and save up for the tax bill? It's something I've been mulling over for a while now, I would appreciate any insight you can offer.

personalfinance,"28, $30k CC debt, homeless - Is bankruptcy my best option?","I have been on PF for awhile, have read numerous bankruptcy threads, and researched the filing process, but since I can't see anything clearly, I'm looking for an outside perspective.

I have $30,000 in credit card debt, across 8 cards, with an average interest rate of 17%. My combined minimum payments were $750 and months before I stopped paying in October, I had inquired about temporary assistance (since I had never been late on any payments, I optimistically thought it couldn't hurt to ask about lowering the interest or consolidating) with no luck. The only assistance any of the cards now offer is to close them and enroll in payment plans that I can't afford, either.

Here's a breakdown of monthly expenses: 

- I have been been living in a rundown motel room with my mom for over a year. It's $340 a week and we have to leave every 28th day and go to another motel for a night, which runs between $70-110. 

- Food is $150 a month for both of us. It's nearly impossible to spend less than that since we don't have a place to store or cook food, and my mom has a severe food allergy that we need to work around.

- My phone is $85 a month but is a few months behind and will be shut off Monday.

- $40-50 a month goes to Lyft or Uber. We walk to get groceries and I walk to and from work when I can, but honestly there are just some days where I can't walk miles at 10pm.

- Once a month, I buy a $7 movie ticket early in the morning and spend a day sneaking into other movies. I spend $2 on Raisinets and $1.79 on a Diet Coke. This is cheaper than losing my mind.

My mom had a job that ended in August and has only found sporadic work since. I lost my online busines this year due to the living situation and finally found a full time job in October that paid $850 bi-weekly...just in time for the company to cut hours in half and announce they'll be closing in January. I've been applying to other places but seem to have missed the holiday hiring season. 

For a bit of background, my mom was the sole survivor of a bacterial meningitis outbreak that has impacted her memory, has several inoperable slipped discs, went through five lumpectomies, and has a gluten intolerance so severe that her liver failed before doctors realized what was wrong. There is no other family, so these are things we financially went through together. Mere weeks after she received a small inheritance that helped pay down much of the debt incurred by this, she was injured and lost permanent partial use of her hand and arm. She was a woodworker and this was...not good. While she has a lawyer, the insurance company for the party at fault for her injury is dragging it into a trial. Things have spiraled since then and we've lost basically everything. She's 61 and soon eligible for SS, but I doubt it'll be much. My point of including that info is to clarify that she is not financially irresponsible. She's an amazing person who has had an absolutely horrific life, and this paragraph doesn't even cover half of what she's been through.

But back to whether or not I should file for bankruptcy, assuming I could even get the money together to do that. I seem to be a good candidate for it - no car, no assets, and no reason to worry I'll be denied a rental in the future, because that's likely not happening either way. 

However, I keep convincing myself I can find a way out of this. Bankruptcy is something I would have to disclose for the rest of my life. I tried so hard to be responsible, save, and build credit so that I could buy a house for both of us in my 30's. You can go through all eight years of my statements and you won't find a Nordstrom shopping spree, trip to Cancun, or a restaurant charge. Hell, I've wanted a Domino's pizza for 5 years but could never justify spending $20 on a pizza. I have obviously lived above my means for the last two years, but only because my options were to charge motel rooms or sleep on the streets with my 60 something mother and dogs. 

So is bankruptcy the logical next step? Do I wait until the spring to see how the trial goes (my mom insists on giving me part of a potential settlement, but I would rather not) or will my credit be too shot by then to bother? The last time I checked my credit score in September, it was 620 (down from 740 before the accident) and I'm sure it's gone down more since I've stopped paying the cards. Is it better to let everything go to collections and play the 'please verify this debt' game?

I'm overwhelmed and appreciate any advice. I had planned on killing myself before Christmas but since it looks like I'm not going to be able to go through with that, I figured I should start trying to plan 2017.

Edit: I'll add that yes, we have contacted 211, churches, local services, etc. multiple times over the last year. There is no assistance available.

personalfinance,Considering taxes when paying off student loan debt versus investing for retirement,"I've heard the common rule of thumb that it is recommended to pay off debt that is higher than 4% interest before saving for retirement. The 4% rule comes from many people feeling that a guaranteed 4% return is better than a hopeful 7% (on average) return with the stock market.

Doesn't this ignore the tax incentives that come with saving for retirement? Assuming you're using either a 401K or IRA, you're not only getting an assumed average 7% return, but you also get to not pay taxes on the deposit. If your state and federal taxes come out to about 33%, wouldn't the equal comparison be that I could either pay X to my student loans or invest (1 + 1/3)X in a retirement account? On top of that, you're able to deduct interest paid on student loans, which slightly lessens the cost of not paying off the loan as quickly.

So what people are really saying with this rule of thumb is that paying X towards a student loan that charges 4% interest is better than investing 1.33X at a potential 7% interest.

Is this right or am I crazy? Does this rule of thumb still make sense when considering taxes?",finance,1481859581

personalfinance,About to pay off some student loans. Any advice?,"I have about $17,000 in student loans with variable interest rates that are creeping up to around 4%. I plan to use my savings to pay the loans off completely. Just curious if anyone has any advice about the best way to make a large payment like this, or any other tips I should be aware of. 

I would love to collect some points by paying with a credit card, but I'm fairly certain neither lender will allow that and fees from third-parties will offset (or exceed) the benefits. Not sure if there are other ways I might be able to use this big payment to my advantage. 

Any positive or negative tax implications I should consider?

personalfinance,Help with W4,"Hey guys I was wondering if you could help me with my w4. I had been working at a company for about 5 years and never had to change anything from my old form. Now that I have a new job I realized I didn't fill it out correctly. I noticed on my pay stub I wasn't paying any federal taxes and I had 2 exemptions on both federal and state taxes. I know I'm going to have to owe this year but I'd like to get back to what I was doing at my previous job and getting my return after tax season. 

I'm single, live with my parent (not by choice lol) and have no kids. 

I believe when I filled out my w4 (the one I messed up on) I filled in line A (enter 1 if no one can claim you as a dependent) with ""1"" and line B (enter 1 if you are single with one job) with ""1."" Everything else I filled in with ""0"" except for line H (add all the previous lines) with ""2."" However I believe I wrote ""exempt"" on line 7. And I think that may have screwed me over. I don't understand this form like most people do so it would be great to get back to paying taxes and getting my refund next year, really trying to buy a home soon.

personalfinance,"Student loan debt under litigation review for $19k, need advice.","Hey guys, so here's a summary of my situation. 

I've had looming debt for over a decade now and I finally got income to start paying this student loan debt off for $19k (with interest) that my mother cosigned for. My mother hasn't been able to pay it for four months and now it's currently under litigation review through Navient collections. I just started getting micro transactions for about 2.5k to 3k a month through Steam but is not a fixed income (and sales will dwindle down eventually). I get paid on a monthly basis but I currently do not have any funds available until the end of December. The review is going underway ""with expected results within 15 days"" so I'll have until the end of December.  My mother is currently on a fixed income with no other assets to her name. 

I've had the privilege to be able to live at home rent free while I get this situation taken care of.  I spoke to a student loan lawyer locally and is asking for $2.5k for assisting me in talking them down. He didn't mention for how much though. The current
loan amount every month is $270 with a variable interest rate of 10% . Navient is currently refusing to offer me a concession amount of $180 with a 4% fixed because ""you seem like you don't need it"" since I told them I could pay whatever X a month. Can the collection agency still push a litigation review on a federal loan or just private? Would it be worth investing money into the lawyer or should I take a different route? 

 So my current options are:

-Paying $270 a month plan for 15 months with a variable interest rate of 10%.

-Postponing litigation review for $80 and investing in $2500 for lawyer to negotiate the amount down by X dollars. What would be a good deal for this option to be even viable?

-Letting Navient go ahead with the litigation and possible judgement against me. I was assured by the lawyer that my mom wont be affected. (Not the preferred method)

I'm concerned if I set up anything with Navient that I'll start paying off the debt and run out of money half way through, only to be in this same litigation situation again.",finance,1481890195

personalfinance,Max 401k contributions or pay off car?,"Throw away, obvious reasons.

Hey guys, I stalk this subreddit more than any other, I'm crazy with my obsession over early retirement and money. I am struggling on what to do here, so here's the question. Should I pay off my car ASAP using money from a 401k, or continue to build up a bigger emergency fund, wait until that fund is bigger than how much I owe, and then pay off the car.

My info:

* age: 21
* full time income: 65k/yr
* side income: 1000 a month
* rent: 800/mo (currently have a roommate paying $400 a month, but he could leave at any moment)
* car payment: 470/mo
* insurance: $170 (for car and motorcycle)
* food $300-$400 (I'm trying to eat at home a lot more)

Current savings:

* 1k emergency
* 12k in 401k
* 2k in checking

Car Info:

* owe 21k
* Interest rate: 6.4%

I just spent $6k to pay off a motorcycle, which is why my savings is drained right now. Plan on keeping that forever, and same with the car, then no more ""fun"" purchases. Minus these two items, I really don't spend money on anything else. About $800 every two weeks goes into the 401k.

My car is my only debt. I'm currently, as of two month ago, contributing the max to my 401k, 28% of my paycheck with a match of up to 10% of my salary depending on how well the company does (5% match no matter what). If I missed anything please let me know.

Side note, I hate debt, I want to spend all my money on saving, but the one thing I splurged on was this car, it's a dodge challenger (2014). I don't want to get rid of it, would rather pay it off and keep it as long as possible. My only other expense is food, I'm trying very hard to keep it to $300 a month. If I missed anything here, please let me know.",finance,1481898532

personalfinance,Is now the time to start panicking about buying a home if I'm right on the bubble?,"I've been teetering on this decision most of the year. Between me and my fiance we make approx. $70k/year (45-me, 25-her). We have no debt between the two of us and own both of our cars, so literally zero debt and about $10k in the bank. However she is pregnant (due early part of next year), and I'm not sure she will return to work right away, which obviously drops are income.

With that we decided to wait on the whole house thing until maybe later next year once the baby is here and we know for sure what are income will be. I can most definitely afford our current expenses on my own, but I'm a little more hesitant on having a mortgage with an MIR and taxes and probably an HOA, etc.  It starts to add up. But with the feds increase the interest rate yesterday and hints that it will continue to go I'm wondering if it would be worth taking the plunge, rather than waiting?",finance,1481900698
personalfinance,"Fell off the bandwagon, need to get back on [Budgeting]","I was calculating my expected tax return this year and found out I'd get about $500 back. This is great, because it means that I almost withheld correctly. However, I also realized I made close to $39,000 and realized how much of that I must have spent. 

I paid about $8000 in taxes (state and federal). At the start of this year I had about $8,000 total in my bank accounts. I now have about $14,800. My monthly expenses are about $1300. I had to buy some furniture this year, I made a larger payment on my student loan a few times, and I'm in grad school, so I also had to pay for books. But this essentially means that I wasted close to $7,000 this year. I am disgusted with myself.  

I began grad school three years about with $200 in my bank account. After careful saving, getting a second job a year ago, I managed to have about $10,000 (after paying for furniture for my apartment, paying first, last, and security, and going on two much needed vacations)

My third year, I've managed to only save about $4,000, but I made so much more. I realized I got complacent with how much money I had saved (it is nice to have $12,000 sitting a bank account when you've never had much money before. You feel so safe). But now, I've decided to take every penny I earn and use it towards the expenses that matter: paying down my student loans. 

In theory, I should be able to take about $2000 a month for nine months and put it towards my loans. I could pay $10,000 off by May before the summer hits and I live frugally off of part-time work. 
 
I just wanted to thank this sub for its help and ask: **what have you done to maintain your motivation?** It gets hard. Sometimes I get satisfied with how much I saved, and times like now, I realize how much I wasted. But better now than three years later when I'm wondering where $20,000 went.",finance,1481901675

personalfinance,"(CAN) Budgeting, TFSA, Savings and Student Loans - Question/Need Advice.","Hi everyone, 

**Situation:** I am a late twenties, living at home (failed business attempt), and have recently changed industries to somewhere that I can actually do very well. Using YNAB to monitor my budgeting/spending for the last 4 months or so. I have not been super diligent with budget, but am not really a money-spending kind of guy. I do not go out that often, and am rather focused on self-development and building myself/my world up. I have a degree in STEM, but am working in Sales now as I am apparently very gifted. Using YNAB, and some reading here, I have managed to pay off a 5K car loan without really trying too hard, and have no other debt besides my student loan. The last month, I broke the company sales record, and brought in an excellent commission cheque - enough to destroy a chunk of my student loan. So....what follows is my breakdown for your review.

* Base Salary: $35K per year (plus commission) 

**From YNAB:**

* Monthly Income (based on the last 4 months): $5,303 
* Expenses (same time frame): $3,368
* Emergency Fund: $1,000.95
* TFSA: $1,500.32
* Chequing: $5,509.40
* Student Loan (NSLSC): ~ $7,000 

**Next Step:** Now that I have a good grasp on budgeting, I want to learn about investments, and ways to make more money. Working in Sales is awesome because I have a base salary, and my commission structure allows me to go up from there based on performance. 

**Questions:**

1. How do I best make use of my TFSA given my situation? - please assume I'm a layman despite the reading I have done. 
2. Regarding the student loan - Should I consider destroying it ASAP or let it hang and build something else up as it's really only a $100/month annoyance in the background (I don't know the interest rate)?
3. What sort of other advice can you throw my way given what you've read?",finance,1481915684
personalfinance,"Pay off a big chunk of my loans and deplete savings, or hold out for PSLF?","I'm a 28 yo lawyer with about 90K in federal, consolidated student loans.

I work in the public sector and intend to do so for the foreseeable future, although I'm not sure what I'll be doing in 7.5 years.

They would stop accumulating interest and I would have more freedom, as well as have a considerable amount of stress lifted (I hate being in debt). Or, is doing that a silly financial decision, and I should put my monies elsewhere such as a Roth IRA?

personalfinance,Should I concentrate on paying my car loan of faster or building back my savings?,"After many years of savings and building my credit, I finally purchased a newer good quality car. I've only had crappy $3000 or less cars in the past and I was tired of not having anything reliable. I was against having a car payment for many years as I had never financed anything, but settled on doing so agreeing that I wouldn't finance more than $5000 and would have a large down-payment. So after a lot of saving, I saved up $5000 to put down on a car, and my dad put in $3000, leaving me financing $5000 of it. My interest rate is 6.75% and my term is 5 years. While this keeps my monthly payments extremely low, I am determined to get it paid off much sooner and not ride out the entire loan so I can save in interest. My instinct is to use any extra cash to pay more towards the car loan to get it paid as quickly as possible. However, using all my savings as a down-payment has left me with no cushion. I am not sure if it would be better financially to use my extra money to build a savings back up, or use it to pay off my car note sooner. I don't have a lot of extra income to play with as my pay is kind of crappy, so doing both may not be a feasible option. Any advice is appreciated.",finance,1481920403
personalfinance,Has anyone out there ever refinanced student loans with not-so-great credit?,"My bf and his parents cosigned on loans for his schooling together, and his parents said they were going to pay some of them for a few years after he graduated and then he would take over. The ones he had been paying all along never had a missed payment, but when he finally ""took over"" the other loans from his parents he realized that they had pretty much never made one payment in full and on time in about two years, even though they had always assured him the loans were getting paid. It was an intense lesson of never letting someone else manage your finances. 

Anyway, that's a long way of saying that my bf's credit is still recovering. It's up from the low 500s to the low 600s after almost a year of no missed payments. He's interested in refinancing at least a portion of his loans (between $13,000-$25,000 on a ~$47k/year income) with sofi or earnest, but isn't sure if it will work because his credit is not great. We're also assuming that his parents' credit is probably bad as well, and so I don't know if having them as a cosigner would even help. 

Does anyone have an experience with these companies to know if refinancing in this situation is even possible?

Edit to add that the loans he wants to refinance are like 8.75% so they would definitely benefit from a lower interest rate.",finance,1481920981

personalfinance,Utilizing 10-year Public Service Loan Forgiveness program?,"Hi, I just got my first full-time job working at a public university and I'm wondering if I should consider utilizing the PSLF program to do a income-based repayment program and then apply for my loans to be forgiven after 120 payments (10 years). I have ~$73,000 in loans, all of which are Direct Loans from the federal government. 

Right now, I'm quoted at about $150 a month using income-based repayment, versus $400ish if I do the gradual 10-year repayment program (start at $400, it increases every 2 years, end in 10 years paying ~$1400) or $970 if I do the 10-year regular repayment program. I'm making about $2,600 a month. 

My biggest concern is that PSLF isn't guaranteed to exist in 10 years, and paying the minimum may end up throwing me off down the road if Congress ends the program.

personalfinance,The problem with saving.,"The title almost seems counter intuitive, why is saving a bad thing, surely having money spare is a good thing? And quite frankly it is, but there are certainly problems associated with it. Having money left over, almost as a ""cushion"" to catch you if you fall is certainly a good idea, one might even accredited it with being a good one. If there were some problems which arose in your life its good to know you have less to worry about and are able to support yourself. I'm certainly not saying you shouldn't do this but when people, which I see time and time again, go too far with this idea it just stops working.

What do I mean by this. Well there are two main ways in which people save. They save for either the big ticket items in life, a new car/house, or they save to support themselves if they happen to fall down a few rungs on the ladder. Lets first talk about the latter of the two. Work out how much you would need to support yourself for a few months whilst you get back on your feet and just squirrel that away, and stop there, at least that's how it works in theory. For example. You would need to pay rent, food and travel for the months whilst you are getting yourself back on your feet. Lets say it would take you 4 months to get back on your feet you would need £75 a week for food, £900 a month for rent and £100 a week for travel, plus a bit extra for other unseen expenditures. That equates to £5700 lets say £6000 to be safe. Obviously these are really rough figures and would vary based on lifestyle and location but you get the idea. Even if it would only cost you 4000 or even 1000 pounds there is still clearly an issue with this. And that is fundamentally that is a lot of money. To put aside 1/2/3/4/5 grand for a just ""in case"" moment and it is a lot to ask. This also becomes problematic as what are you forgoing to have this ""cushion"" of support. If it is not practical to do this then you can't feasibly achieve it, end of. Also in my mind it begs the question why do you bother to work if you are not going to spend the money. I'm not saying having some sort of support is a bad thing just that sometimes when you see people talk about how they have got 10 grand stored away for the rainy days in life it seems pointless, almost idiotic. My bit of advice to you would be to have some sort of support but don't go overboard otherwise you cause yourself issues.

So what about them big ticket items? Well saving isn't the best idea here either. If anything I would say paying off your debts is the best thing you can do, particularly student debts as they rise by significant amounts over quite a few years.Also by paying off your debts and therefore having a good reputation allows you to borrow more money, more easily and therefore own better and bigger things whilst having to pay less money (short term) for said items. Yes in the long term it will cost you more money and quite frankly if you can avoid it, don't borrow money, but very few have that privilege and therefore borrowing money isn't a bad idea if you have the means to support yourself and therefore you don't have to save up money to get the things in life that you want (When I say borrow money I do not mean of these websites which charge you fortunes for it, but I hope that is obvious).

It is also important to note that at 2% interest rate if you only had a few grand stored away in your savings, or even 10 grand stored away you would only see 200 pound worth of interest which over a year isn't even a pound a day... is it really worth having all that money in a bank doing practically nothing?


So what am I trying to say by all this. The bottom line is that saving is a good thing but having the means to support yourself is far more important and allows you to borrow money and having the same, if not a better lifestyle than saving would provide you. Also if you do want to have a pot of money left to the side for the dark days, that's fine but don't go overboard.

I hope this helps some people, in some capacity even if it i just to start a decent conversation about saving without people boasting.",finance,1481932730

personalfinance,Co-sign on siblings student loan or simply loan them the money?,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

Quick question here regarding a sibling's student loan.  Long story short I am the only direct family member which can co-sign on this student loan that is required for attendance in the upcoming semester.  The amount is 6000 dollars through a Wells Fargo Collegiate Loan and is at 11.14% fixed interest rate and due to my presence as a co-signer we have been approved.

Documents are pending signatures but I am wondering if I should just loan my sibling the money instead?

I have ~25k in savings so the 6k is not entirely destructive and I would greatly prefer to not incur the costs of interest and risk that come with this loan. I would rather quickly write up a loan agreement and get it notarized between the two of us and call it good.

Would this be the best course of action or should we just take the loan?  As far as my current position I am 28 and make ~60k/year.  I currently rent but will be looking toward buying a home in the next couple of years. No current outstanding debt and a credit score (according to the loan report) of approximately 750. My current savings rate is ~1,400/month. My sibling has a decent paying job (~15$/hr) with fluctuating hours.

I'm 30 years old, married, with a baby on the way. I am at a job where I'm around 100-120k per year, and I feel like I'm stuck between a choice to pay off my mortgage (condo), or try to jump into ETFs and Index funds to try to beat the interest rate on my mortgage. Not actively looking to move out just yet, as we figure we can stay in our condo for another 2-3 years with a small child on the way. 

Here is what I'm working with right now:

130k in Scotia Powersavings
10k chequing

50k coming due in February 2017 from a Scotia market powered GIC (global) 

10k in various stocks with Questrade

45k in TFSA (maxed)
60k in RRSP (maxed each year, matching with employer, why leave money on the table)

3 years left on 5yr lock in with mortgage amortized over 25 years, 2.20% rate... reasonable payments,with about 180k left on the mortgage.

So I'm hoping for some guidance, I'm generally a fairly risk averse investor but this might be an opportunity to pay off the mortgage, on the other hand there is value in keeping those chequing and savings funds freed up in case we found a new construction home that we'd like to put a down payment on. Should I look into investing those funds into ETFs over the next few years to see where we're at when the mortgage is up in year 5?

personalfinance,Can we afford for me to stay home with my baby?,"Hi PF! My husband and I are trying to figure out whether I can really afford to stay home once our baby is born in June 2017. We have a lot of savings (about $120K right now, but will be $130K by June) which we saved up over the past 3-4 years in anticipation of me eventually staying home with a baby, which is something I have always wanted to do, and we also have a lot of my husband's med school debt left (also about $130K, at interest rates of 5-7%). We might be in a somewhat unique situation given that my husband is currently in the middle of his training in a well-paying medical subspecialty making only ~$4,500-5,000 per month, but in 3 years when he finishes he will make about $15,000 per month (roughly 300K per year minus taxes) or more if he decides to practice privately, so we have not thought much about long-term savings for retirement and the like because it will be a lot easier to do that in a few years than it is now. 

Here is a breakdown of our income/expenses:

&amp;nbsp;

**Monthly Income Currently**

$4900 husband's salary

$4100 my salary (not in medicine)


**Total**: $9000/month

&amp;nbsp;

**Conservative Estimate of Monthly Expenses (once baby is born in 6 months):** 

$3500 rent + utilities (we live in a crazy expensive city)

$2500 living expenses ($300 eating out + entertainment, $500 groceries, $800 for travel on average, remainder on health/personal stuff, home supplies, etc.)

$300 med school loan repayment (this is assuming that I stop working and we can move to an income-based repayment plan)

$500 baby-related expenses (divided over 3 years, I used http://www.babycenter.com/ to estimate this cost conservatively, averaging out various one-time costs over 3 years)

$460 car payment + insurance

&amp;nbsp;


**Total**: $7260

&amp;nbsp;

If I stop working this would mean my husband's income of $4,900 would be our only income, leading to a $4900-7260 = $2,360 monthly deficit for the remaining 3 years of his medical training, which comes to a total of $84,960. His income will increase slightly over the next 3 years of training but I did not add that in because I am assuming our rent will also drift upwards as has been the trend in our city for the past few years, so the two should cancel out.

&amp;nbsp;

Even though nearly $85K of a total 3-year deficit sounds like a lot, we will have about $130,000 saved up when the baby is born, which still leaves an emergency fund of about $45,000 of a buffer. Obviously if something major changes in our lives (like my husband loses his job which is very unlikely or we have a very large unexpected expense), I can go back to work and we can put our baby in daycare, and we can downsize our apartment and/or living expenses. But as things stand now, it seems to me like we can afford for me to stay home, and I really want to. An obvious downside to all of this is that we are letting his medical debt stay put for 3 years (our monthly payments plus the REPAYE program would cover the interest every month), but we could pay it off in about 3 years after he finishes training by contributing $4K/month to his loans (which with our $7K in monthly expenses would still leave about $4K per month for other savings). It would be nice to pay his loans back sooner but not doing so is a small price to pay compared to getting to spend the first years of baby's life by his/her side.

personalfinance,Had verbal agreement to slowly pay down debt with dentist after insurance denied claim. Now dentist is demanding remaining balance ($2400) paid up by April. Wife and I cannot afford to do this and they won't negotiate again. What are our options?,"Sorry for the long title. My wife needed emergency dental work last year when one of her teeth shattered at work. She has insurance through her dad's work and called the dentist before going into make sure they took his insurance (Delta). She went in, had a root canal done along with getting a few other procedures taken care of before they handed us a bill for nearly $3000 months after the procedures claiming that they didn't accept his insurance afterall. We handed the issue off to the insurance holder since his insurance wouldn't even talk to us about why they weren't covering it, and it took nearly 8 months for them to finally tell us that her dad had Delta PPO and the dentist doesn't accept that (after verbally telling my wife they took ""All Delta""). 

We've been slowly making payments after moving because of family health reasons nearly 10 hours away from the dentist. We had a verbal agreement in place to continue paying as much as we can (not much, usually about $50 a month right now because we're working on paying down other debts with higher interest rates, and throwing additional cash towards it when we can). 

Thursday they called and threatened my wife that they would send the bill to collections if it wasn't paid off by April in full. That's roughly $600 a month, and we most certainly can't pay that. 

Our budget:

* Wife's monthly minimum income (minimum after taxes if she doesn't pick up extra hours at work): $1000
* My monthly minimum income: $1700
* Usual additional income from overtime\extra hours: $300

* rent: $1200 
* High risk fee (until Feb when that's paid off) $200
* electric: $70
* Internet: $50
* Cell: $170 (-$70 monthly from family members who contribute to a family plan)
* Credit cards: $250
* Store cards: $200
* misc payment cards: $50
* Insurance: $120
* subscription services $22 (includes yearly subscriptions broken down monthly)
* savings for car repairs\replacement $50
* Perkins loan payment $100

* Total Expenses: $2482 (give or take)
* Total remaining: $218 for gas and groceries monthly.

The majority of the credit card debit came from some stupid spending decisions when moving (putting moving truck on the card, putting move-in expenses on it, using it for groceries our first year married to get the ""points"" and then being short paying the whole balance at the end of the month, so only paying minimums, etc) Store cards are the same way, haven't touched most of them in nearly a year, and same with the misc expense cards. We have a Care Credit account that we have a large bill with, but also 18 months no interest to pay down after our dog ingested something he shouldn't have and we had to pay for.

Total debt:

* $4700 - CC1
* $1050 - CC2 (was a 0% interest card we used as a ""moving loan"", but that period has ended)
* $800 - Store card 1
* $450 - store card 2
* $200 - store card 3
* $800 - Care Credit account (interest free for 18 months, making regular payments on)
* $2400 - Dental bill
* $13,000 - Perkins loan not on income based repayment
* $42,000 - federal student loans on income based repayment ($0 a month currently)

Because we have so little left after all our bills for gas and groceries, the extra $200-300 we get monthly usually also goes towards groceries, paying down other store cards, trying to snowball a few payments away, etc. Since moving in July we've paid off 3 other cards totalling about $700, but there were a few months where we were also living with family and didn't have rent to pay, but had a car repair, and needed our deposit and moving expenses to pay as well. It's all a mess.

So, our current thought is to explore a consolidation personal loan, roll up the majority of our debt with the dental debit into a single payment, and then throw additional income at it whenever possible. I get paid every other Friday, so roughly twice a year I get a third paycheck, along with bi-yearly bonuses. We're throwing all of that towards debt, and my next additional paycheck comes in June along with the bonus. Any side cash (Craigslist sales, donating plasma, Ebay, etc) goes towards paying down our store cards and other debts.

Would getting a (roughly) $10,000 personal loan, putting our CCs on it, the dental bill, and some of the larger store cards be a bad idea? Are there any personal loan providers out there that would be recommended?",finance,1481991374

personalfinance,Negative Amortization on Federal Student Loans??,"Hi everyone,

This post has been a long time coming, as I wanted to learn more about personal finance first- I’ve learned so much from reading here and posting my questions.  I would like to get all of your opinions one more time!


I’m 28 years old and in May 2016 I graduated from Veterinary School at a large University in the Mid-West.  After looking for work for 3 months (it’s tough out there!) I finally landed a job in Mid-September as a veterinarian.  So now I can finally start working on my student loans!


I graduated with ~$308,000.00 in federal loans, all from veterinary school.  They are all around 6.8%.
This is almost entirely from tuition and school fees, as I lived very frugally throughout school, and used money I had previously saved for the majority of my living expenses. …Maybe $15,000 is from living expenses.


My pre-tax salary is $67k with no benefits (other than getting to treat my pets at-cost… yay).  Unfortunately this is pretty typical for first-year veterinarians.  So my question for everyone is… Negative Amortization on student loans?


Under the standard 10 year plan, my monthly payment would be ~$3,600 which is of course impossible at this time.  Based on my debt and my salary, I qualify for PAYE.  Using the re-payment calculators on the federal student loan website, the total cost of the loan on the 10 year plan would be approximately $410,000 by the time everything is said and done.  Using the same calculator, under the PAYE plan, my totally monthly payments would be ~$186,000 at the end of 20 years, and then approximately $600,000 will be forgiven, resulting in a pretty hefty tax bill.  However, at current tax rates, the taxes on this would be ~$220,000.  So even with the monthly payments I made, that would only be ~$406,000… cheaper than the 10 year plan and spread out over 20 years!  I talked to people at GreatLakes (my loan servicer) and the only way I would be ineligible for PAYE in the future would be if I start making over 300k a year... which almost certainly will never happen (veterinarians top out around 90k in most areas).  So overall it seems like a pretty good deal, as long as tax rates don’t go crazy.  Is there anything I am missing here?  It almost seems too good to be true.  


In order to help pay this large tax bill, I figure I would put some money monthly into a long term investment account.


I have no other debt.


Here is my budget:
My after tax monthly income is about $4,000.  

Rent:        $650

internet	$10

energy bill	$50

groceries	$150

gas	        $100

gym	        $10

Going out:  $100

Health insurance: $200

Student Loan Payments under PAYE for the next 12 months: $0


…No car payments or anything like that.  My mother pays my car insurance (Thanks!) and also cell phone bill (because I only use it to talk to her, duh : P)  So I have about $2,730 to save monthly.  I already have a &gt;3 month emergency fund and have maxed out my 2016 Roth IRA into a vanguard target account.


With all that being said…  in 2017 I am thinking of doing 


$458	monthly into my Roth IRA

$450	Into a Vanguard mutual fund for more retirement

$500	into vanguard mutual fund or etf (with the hopes of cashing out in 20 years to pay off the tax bill)


This will then leave me with ~$1,800 monthly to save for things like down payments for large purchases, starting to pay for my own car insurance, my student loan tax bill in-case that investment account crashes, etc.


Anyone have any insight on this?  How is this overall plan?  


Thanks!!!

gaming,Secret Santa made my gaming dreams come true.,"Gaming has been a large part of my life since..forever. My childhood sucked, blah blah blah, so I'd always lose myself in either books or games when I had to be home. In middle school I used to play my Sega constantly! My brothers and I would play versus on Mean Beam Machine, no idea what it's actually called, until we thought our fingers were going to fall off. Good times :) In middle school my dad got a computer and we'd take turns playing Unreal Tournament. A little later Dark Age of Camelot was released and our. Minds. Were. BLOWN.

Anywho, long story short, I've kept up with that trend. I'm more on the PC side of things and play a lot of MMO's; WoW, Star Wars Old Republic, Rift, etc. I have dabbled with console as well, Bioshock is hands down my favorite game series EVER. My husband and I actually met through World of Warcraft, crazy I know!

Now onto the information you really came here for! Today FedEx rang my doorbell and had the largest package for me that I've ever received; and no not in a sexual way, unfortunately. I'm thoroughly bemused, because I definitely didn't order something that large. I look at the shipping label and see the c/o Lia-Panda and immediately start freaking out. I was a lurker last year for the Secret Santa because I was too nervous to actually sign up. I have anxiety, so sue me. I start ripping that sucker open as carefully as I can since there's ""fragile"" stickers all over it. I rip open both layers of bubble wrap and immediately want to cry, laugh, and vomit all at the same time. 

The first thing I see are some fans. I just freeze there with blow-job mouth. I'm looking at my husband and back at the box. I don't want to get my hopes up so I tell myself to calm the fuck down and open the rest of it. My mother-in-law helps me tip it on its side so I can scoot it out of the box. And behold, a god damn computer tower is born! I'm so blown away I just didn't, and still don't, know what to say. The is my first Secret Santa and they absolutely blew my expectations out of the water. 

I don't really remember everything I put in my description, but I don't think my Secret Santa could have possibly known how much this would mean to me. I'm currently gaming on a laptop that is no longer able to play the new games that are released and I sometimes have to play on low graphics just to play some of the old ones. My husband and I are living with his parents because money is tight and we aren't able to live on our own yet; yes it's embarrassing, but you do what you gotta do. I've been researching for months how to build a computer and daydreaming about the components that I'll be able to put inside it. This is the first step! Hopefully over the next couple years I can save my nickles and dimes and build the bad-ass gaming machine that I've been dreaming about! I'm so glad that the box has a return address so that I can send a thank you card! My mind is so completely blown right now and I'm just sitting here grinning like a fool staring at my awesome new tower! I'll attempt to post a couple photos, hopefully they don't totally fail. 

Sorry for the wall of text, damn. That wasn't supposed to happen.

TL;DR: I've been wanting to build a gaming computer for ages and my Secret Santa sent me a computer tower to begin my journey! And I'm very grateful.

energy,StarTech: Clean Energy From Waste; plasma converter,"Joseph Longo, CEO of Startech Environmental Corporation, has spent the best part of twenty years designing and building a machine with the appetite of a pig. Longo’s ‘plasma converter’ turns rubbish into clean energy, consuming anything thrown into its jaws and capable of rendering almost any toxic material, besides nuclear waste, harmless.

How does it work?

Rubbish is shovelled into the machine and shredded using a large drill. It is then fed into a plasma chamber where it is heated to 30,000° F. The superheated plasma is formed from stable gas using electrodes; a current is passed between two electrodes sitting inside a steel chamber filled with gas – in this case, just ordinary air. Electrons are ripped from the air and – hey presto – plasma is created. The plasma conducts current to create an intense, lightning-like energy so powerful that any rubbish entering the chamber is torn apart, molecule from molecule.

There are two by-products resulting from this process; syngas, a compound of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which can be turned into fuel, and molten glass which has several applications including the manufacture of tiles and road asphalt. Syngas is particularly useful as it means the converter can be completely self-sufficient after its first run.

https://www.pollutionsolutions-online.com/news/green-energy/42/breaking_news/meet_joseph_longos_revolutionary_plasma_converter/34134/

Even a blackout would not stop the operation of the facility,"" Longo says. It all sounds far too good to be true. But the technology works. Over the past decade, half a dozen companies have been developing plasma technology to turn garbage into energy. ""The best renewable energy is the one we complain about the most: municipal solid waste,"" says Louis Circeo, the director of plasma research at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""It will prove cheaper to take garbage to a plasma plant than it is to dump it on a landfill."" A Startech machine that costs roughly $250 million could handle 2,000 tons of waste daily, approximately what a city of a million people amasses in that time span. Large municipalities typically haul their trash to landfills, where the operator charges a ""tipping fee"" to dump the waste. The national average is $35 a ton, although the cost can be more than twice that in the Northeast (where land is scarce, tipping fees are higher). And the tipping fee a city pays doesn't include the price of trucking the garbage often hundreds of miles to a landfill or the cost of capturing leaky methane—a greenhouse gas—from the decomposing waste. In a city with an average tipping fee, a $250-million converter could pay for itself in about 10 years, and that's without factoring in the money made from selling the excess electricity and syngas. After that break-even point, it's pure profit. Someday very soon, cities might actually make money from garbage.

http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2007-03/prophet-garbage

The Financial Status of Startech is in Chapter 11. Why with such a superb technology has it reached this point? Because of a hostile take-over attempt that striped the company of all operating capital. The hostile takeover by ""Friendly LLC"" (Cute Name??) for $15,000,000 was a front for a little company called GAZPROM. This is the Russian State Owned and publicly traded power and gas company with net revenues of over 250 billion. In 2008 If they wanted Startech at $15 million... there must be a reason. converter

Right now for $2.3 million we can acquire the entire company, all its assets, all the patents, and move forward with the billions worth of serious business that is just waiting for our management team to move into place.

personalfinance,"Received inheritance, investing for school","Hi Reddit. I've been a long time reader but never posted, so I have a very basic understanding of finances. I'm going to be attending 4 years of grad school starting in August and looking at 300,000 in total tuition and expenses. Due to an unexpected loss I'm preparing to inherit about 170,000 before the new year. I'd like to use this money in the next two years or so to pay for the first half of grad school but I'm not near knowledgable enough to handle this amount. The inheritance is coming in cash and bonds and I have planned to follow the guidance of the financial advisor that has been overseeing the accounts. He advised me to stay clear of the stock market with such a short term investment. He also advised me to basically sell most or all of the bonds due to ""increasing interest rates"" (which I don't entirely understand) and just hold cash. Does that sound correct? I would have expected to be able to invest this money in something for the time being. I'm mid 20s, living at home rent free, recently employed full time but no assets or debts of any kind. Any advice would be appreciated",finance,1482032846
personalfinance,Is it worth applying for credit cards?,"I'm a college freshman who turned 18 two months ago and, hoping to build credit, want to apply for a credit card. I'm specifically looking at the Citi Double Cash card (preferred) and the Discover It Chrome for Students card. I want to be relatively sure of my approval odds so I don't get hit with an unnecessary number of credit inquiries.

To start, I have two federal student loans in my name amounting to $4350 for one semester (an amount which will double early next month). These are the only two items on my credit report, with 100% on-time payments for each as payment has been deferred.

From what I've researched (both from r/personalfinance and the MyFICO forums), I am allowed to count both scholarships/grants and wages as income for repayment purposes. In that case, I make about $13.5k from a part-time job (as averaged from my last four paystubs, but not reported on a 2016 W2; my income this year is higher than last year's), and I also have $12.4k in scholarships and grants; summing to $27.9k in total. I also have about $2k combined from both savings and checking accounts.

In terms of living expenses, housing and food through my university this year amount to $9.8k ($1150 per month in an 8.5-month school year; housing alone is $6.1k for 8.5 months or about $720 monthly).

Though it may not need to be stated, I only plan to use my credit card (whichever one I eventually get) to pay for some of the things I already pay for anyway. I'm hoping these values are enough to be accepted for a credit card, though I'm concerned both my credit score and income may be too low. I don't want to have to ask my parents to co-sign a card for me.

A secondary question: should I use my previous home's address or my school address when applying? While I am planning on moving back to my hometown this summer, after that I plan on residing in my school's city permanently (or at least until I graduate).",finance,1482033482

investing,"To go bonds or international, and in which account?","So I am currently 100% US stock (almost all S&amp;P 500 or vanguard total market, with a slight mid/small cap tilt).  I have about 25k in taxable, ~6500 in a Roth IRA, ~6500 in a traditional IRA, and 18k in my 401k.  I'm 32, so I'm not terribly worried about short term risk.  

Next year I will be contributing to the Roth as my income has grown to the point where the traditional no longer makes sense.  I'm a little nervous about the market, but not to the point I want to pull anything out.  I just think I need to make sure my non-401k investments go to either international or bonds next year for a slightly more conservative allocation.

The bond funds in my 401k are all terrible and expensive, so the 401k has to stay in stock.

So the questions:

1)  Bonds or international?  My immediate boglehead reaction is bonds.  The things that give me pause are Trump's claims during the election that he wants to default on bonds and negotiate them down.  While this is unlikely, I think it generally speaks to the GOP attitude towards the sanctity of US debt, and it makes me nervous.  The second is that even if everything is hunky dory, we know that interest rates are going to go up relatively quickly and relatively soon.

2)  Which account to put either one in?  Should bonds go in Traditional or Roth (I can swap the stock in the traditional for bonds)?  Should international go in Traditional or Roth?  Is there any case to be made that either one is better in taxable?

3)  If international, I don't want to swing for the fences, I just don't want to correlate strongly with the US.  Should I be looking at regional, or total world (account is with vanguard)?

4)  If bonds, should I be tilting towards corporate bonds or treasuries, or should I just get a total bond fund and forget about it?

From paying it off every month and never carrying a balance my credit score is around 730.

The two technical colleges I'm looking at (was already accepted into the one)both cost right around $20,000 for  the two year programs I'm looking at.

I also have $7100 in debt to my parents at no interest, with my current average monthly payment currently at about $800.

personalfinance,Upside down on unreliable car that has an absurd interest rate that I want to trade in. What are my options?,"So my fiancee's old car basically died las summer so we went out and purchased an inexpensive used car that I thought was a good deal at the time. It's a 2011 Ford Fiesta SE, and I didn't do my homework on it ahead of time which is completely uncharacteristic of me when shopping around. These models are very well known to have transmission issues and ours is one of those suffering from them. 

I don't want to put the money into it to get it ""fixed"" (I've read plenty where the issue comes back after $500-$1k in repairs). I owe a little under $7k on it and the interest rate on it is 10%. It's worth roughly $4.5k in trade-in value according to KBB. The payments are $161/month.

Our cost of living is about to go down roughly $300/month, I'll be getting a raise at the start of the year, and I should be getting a good bit back in taxes ($3-4k). Trading it in and purchasing a brand new car with a low interest rate is definitely an available option to me, as my credit scores have skyrocketed since I purchased the Fiesta (630ish then, 750-790 now).

So my question is should I trade it in as-is being upside down? Should I pay down a good bit of it when possible before trading it in so I'm not upside down? Or would refinancing it for a lower interest rate and holding onto it for a while longer be a good idea? Keep in mind that it's known for being very unreliable and cost of ownership will likely outweigh any money I save on it with a lower interest rate, especially since the payments are already very low. I just don't know if there's really a difference in trading it in upside down or paying it off so it's worth roughly even or more than what I owe.

BACKGROUND; tmi?:

I have Bipolar II disorder, high functioning autism, an anxiety disorder, and early onset pmr (a pain disorder) and though I really work hard to manage them, I still get occassional bouts of low mania and deep depressions. 

While I consider myself lucky that I have never spent myself into debt, as people under psychosis can often do, I am aware (after the fact) that I sometimes buy thing I don't need (though I think I do at the time) when I'm not quiet right. Though I try to notice when Im becoming ill, sometimes it subtly creeps in.

For these reasons, I've put off getting a credit card, as Im scared that I can't trust myself.

When ill, I have occasionally paid household and doctors bills late. Nothing more than a week or two, but I've heard this will hurt my credit.

Also, because of my illness, I only have a part time job; I make about $1,000 a month. Im working on building my skills so I can get a full time or second part time. I once, when things were really bad, tried to get on Social Security Disability, but was denied because I couldn't give a date of when I became unable to work. About once a year, I have had to take a month or so off work to recover from mental illness or a pmr flare of pain. I've tried to look into short term disability insurance, but it doesnt look like anyone would cover me. Ergo, I try to save a lot during the good times.

 My hubby is an adjunct prof, has good credit, and while we never know how many classes he'll get, we have med/dental  benefits and are pretty secure/live in our means. He does have some college debt ($40k), but the fed government will pay it off in about two years.

I have about $85k in mutual funds from an inheritance from an amazing great grandparent.

I have about $3k in a savings account.

I get anxious and overwhelmed when trying to learn about my personal finance. I find banks and money management scary and I ger anxiety attacks. I kinda shut down and then don't do anything. I hate that I often avoid ooking at my debit card statements, because I know I need to look for discrepancies.

I assumed that because Ive never had a credit card, I don't have a credit history, but perhaps this is just me hoping?",finance,1482096001
personalfinance,Help with federal employee retirement plan,"Hey guys, I recently just started my job as a federal employee for about a month. I'm 26 years old and this is my first job so I'm still new to this whole thing. I'm at around the GS-9 level right now. I did some reading on this subreddit and I'm working on building an emergency fund while paying the last of my credit card debt which I have about 1,500 left.

I'm currently contributing only 5% into the traditional TSP and putting it 50/50 into C and S fund. I read the ""how to handle $"" and eventually I will work towards putting around 10-15% into TSP. My question is should I do a split of traditional TSP and Roth or go full into certain one? Should I stick with my distribution of 50/50 into C and S funds or put it into a different fund? 

My original plan was to only contribute 5% and try to save at least 400 each paycheck because, hopefully, by the time I reach early 30s I could buy a house. Is this a good idea or should I contribute more into my TSP like the ""how to handle $"" post?

investing,Question on starting an investment account for nephews,"Hi, 
I am wondering if I can open an investment account for my nephews - something I can put a few hundred dollars in every year. The idea is that I would choose the investments now and when they get to about 10 years I would let them choose the investments ( or whatever age they're able to start understanding the concept somewhat) and teach them how to make these decisions.

I looked into  UGMA/UTMA accounts but on vanguards website saw this as a consideration -  ""There is a significant impact on federal financial aid. The account is treated as the child's asset and weighed more heavily in financial aid calculations"". Just in case i'm able to contribute a significant amount to this account by the time the kids go to college, i do not want their chances of financial aid hampered (they will most likely need it to go to college). How much is too much?

Any thoughts/suggestions?

personalfinance,Saving for our daughter--Best Game Plan?,"My daughter was born in February of this year, and as soon as we could, we set up a savings account for her. Since then, my partner and I have been putting $20 in her account each week and hope to continue until she's 18. Her current balance is $1,050.23. What's the best game plan to maximize her wealth? I'm sure that a savings account, with its pitiful interest rate (0.05%), isn't the best way. Should we invest in stocks? CDs? 529? Etc.?

For additional information, my partner and I have not invested our own money into anything (except for our 403(B)'s through work). Together, we currently make $127k. We do plan to have more children, and hope to continue, though we realize with three kids, $60 a week would be a lot. We each have student loans (~$500 a month for ~eternity). 

Edit: More additional information: We're also paying a mortgage of $1800 a month, as well as $845 a month for childcare, sans two months out of the year (we're both teachers,which means we only get paid 10 months out of the year  and no option through district for 12 month payments. However, we budget for summer pretty well). Our total student loan debt is ~$24k each. The interest rates when broken down are about 5%.

personalfinance,"(SWE) Student debt, no real employable skills, unsure of my future plans...what do?","Hi all,
I'm a 25-year-old Swede and my personal finance is looking very, very bad in the long term.I've made terrible decisions in my life and I'm trying to catch up before I'm too old. While I'm not starving anytime in the near future, I realy need some advice on how to make better financial decisions and invest for my future.

First of all, my background: I made the insanely stupid decision to study a lib-arts degree at university right after graduating from high school. My degree? ""Media and Communications Studies"". I studied this for two years, then dropped out and tried Sociology for a year, dropped out of that too and worked a few odd jobs - waiter, bartender, a few other unskilled jobs. Later, I tried to go back to school and finish that degree, but had medical problems and fell into a serious manic depression. Another year passed, all my savings were used up, then I went back to uni and finished my bachelor's degree - at the age of 24. I realized this degree was fucking worthless and didn't want to do a master's in the subject. I was broke and moved back in with my parents. 

The problem: I am now 25k (in US dollars) in student debt, and no plan for my foreseeable future. As it is now, I'm only useful for unskilled shitjobs - which is fine for now, but it's not how I want to live my life. To be honest, I don't even know what kind of ""career"" I'm useful for. But I've always had an interest in art, so I decided to try my luck with graphic design and web design. I'm taking courses in graphic and UI design right now, while also working a part-time job designing leaflets for local bands. I really enjoy doing this, but I'm not sure how far this path will take me. My family is telling me to go for a master's degree in graphic design, and I like the idea...just not the extra 10k in student debt. That degree will cost. 

I'm ""safe"" for now, but I really have to plan ahead and decide for the next years. Master's degree in graphic or web design? Live with my family, work hard, and slowly pay my debts?

So, to make a long story short:

PROS:

- The 25k in debt are to the Swedish governenment, who are fairly patient as far as debtors go. No one's ordering me to pay up now. The interest rate is just 0.6%, and will probably sink to 0.3% next year. 
- I have a family. As long as I'm living with my parents, I'm not in a financial emergency. I hate living like this, and want to move out again ASAP, but for now it's the only money-saving option.

CONS:

- I have few employable skills. Shitty lib-arts degrees in journalism don't count. 
- My CV looks like shit: odd jobs here and there, not even a whole year of working in one place. I'm cringing as I read it.
- The student loans are only gonna grow bigger and bigger, ever so slowly. I have no payment plan yet, and graphic designer or web designer doesn't pay *that* well.

MachineLearning,[D] Help me make sure I understand the potential uses of neural networks correctly. Which of those assumptions about possible uses for neural network is wrong?,"Neural networks are used to identify patterns and it's accuracy relies on a large amount of data being fed into it.

Can it make sense of patterns without humans feeding the output to train it? For example, could I show it lots of animal pictures and tell it to group them by anatomic similarities? Or if used in tandem with NLP could a website like reddit feed it all of the users post history so it can detect patterns in their behaviours? Or even detect fake accounts or figure out that a user uses multiple accounts?

Could the same method that was used to teach it to play go teach it to play other games? Maybe by collecting replays from pro gamers and figuring out patterns on 1v1 games? Could the same, with enough data and processing power, be also used on shooters to figure out the best strategy? 

Could it feed into patient data and diagnose diseases based on that knowledge?

personalfinance,A few debt related questions...,"OK so as have a lot of people I have been horrible with past bills, and I very much want to repair my credit. I have a little over $2000 in collections, about $1200 of that being hospital bills.. I neglected to pay what my insurance didn't cover. Always seemed hard being paycheck to paycheck and all but I do realize that there is always a way.. I just didn't do what I needed to do. 

So what I've done is write down all my debt.. there is a credit card that I got in 2010 that had horrible interest rates, but I felt it was a good idea at the time. That card was closed and it is utilizing 180% of my credit. It falls off in October so I obviously don't want to touch it at this point.. is that going to be a significant change to my credit score? 

The $1200 of hospital bills is interesting... I have been offered a job from that same hospital and  start in a little over a week. I would imagine asking for a settlement would be a bad idea but obviously I want that debt paid asap. Any tips about that situation? 

The collections I have, one for AT&amp;amp;T, 3 for insurance companies that charged me the full amount after I switched companies, and a couple I'm forgetting.. I am not denying the debt is mine. However should I still request verification of the debt? If They do not provide it what would the next step be? 

Lastly, there is an auto title loan from loanmart. This is actually under my girlfriends name, but I was paying the monthly payment on it. Horrific loan but desperate at the time. I ended up losing my job, couldn't pay the loan, and they repoed the car. Now there is over 2000 worth of interest on the account so what was a $2600 loan is now well over $4000. They have not sent any notice that the car has been sold, which is what they said would happen which would have went towards the loan of course. Are we stuck with this? I feel as though the interest is going to climb higher  and higher and right now the $4000+ seems pretty unreachable.  

I very much want to fix my horrible credit score and clear my report I just feel stuck at this point. I am determined however. I will be getting a secured credit card soon from capital one, which from doing a lot of research should definitely help.

Bitcoin,Government Involvement &amp; Centralization,"I was thinking that if bitcoin had 1 gigabyte block size in the future and had mega-nodes around the world would such a scenario be as terrible as people make it seem like? As long as governments do not converge (seeming more unlikely with the faltering experiment of the EU) each independent sovereign country could run their own subsidized node with a dedicated data tunnel between other mega-nodes for other countries.

Users could connect to their own country’s mega-node farms (through SPV), banks could each have their own node too. Miners would mine the top of the blockchain and throw away old transactional data once enough confirmations have been performed (1 months worth?). It would behave much like the DNS system today with several layers of node branching with each layer down pruning ledger history more aggressively, with the added benefit of no master-keys unlike DNS’s root servers.

It would be very difficult to corrupt more than half of the governments which subsidise mega-node providers to change the bitcoin rules without consensus, and if that were the case and most of the population was against those changes then capital flight would ensue. It would be against the miners interests and every single individual/business which has savings &amp; transacts in bitcoin. Competing smaller cryptocurrencies could also keep larger ones in check since trading between cryptocurrencies is relatively easy and would be the means of capital flight (fiat money would still exist too).

As much as people like to mention that it would be much easier to attack the consensus rules of bitcoin in such a state (which is not incorrect), if it were central to the global economy such an attack would be as bigger news than the 2008 financial crisis, everyone’s living standard would decrease and war would likely ensue. All of which seem extremely likely unless you’re very pessimistic about geopolitics, which goes against historical statistics that large-scale wars may in fact become ancient history if trends continue.

Obviously, this is quite imaginary and may be considered far in the future, the first hurdle would be for many countries to accept bitcoin as legal tender.

I realize many people behind bitcoin are completely against any type of government involvement, that’s why they use it and that’s very understandable. If the governments of highly-developed nations were as bad as many make it out to be our living standards wouldn’t be as great as they are today relative to human history. Bitcoin may get people more engaged &amp; educated in who we vote for to represent us. We get all the benefits bitcoin provides and may escape the painful economic-cycle which fiat money, central banks, money printing &amp; credit creation artificially creates. Interest rates for borrowing &amp; saving money would be based on the free market since it would be impossible to be controlled in such an environment. Actual long term economic growth may be possible under such a global reserve currency rather than the economic volatility we have today which unfortunately cannot be avoided. Bitcoin becomes a true store of value.

TL;DR bitcoin becomes trustless at the country-level, rather than the personal-level. We get all the benefits bitcoin provides, with the downside being the need to trust our government (which most of us already require to live prosperous anyway).

Note that individuals can choose to trust whichever mega-node provider (and its associated federal or state government) they want, not just the country/state they happen to live in.

I might get a raise in March after being with my employer for one year, but I'm not going to assume it. I have just now paid off my 5th student loan for the year, after a very aggressive payment schedule. 

My student loans are now all at interest rates of 3.15-4.25. I had been putting around 350 a month EXTRA towards whatever my highest interest rate was. I am now considering a new approach, wherein I put this extra money into a Roth IRA. I am going to post my current budget as well as my current budget for 2017, assuming my extra loan payment went into an IRA retirement account instead of to my pocket now.

    Monthly allowances
     Food: $220
     Gas: $85
     Misc: $20

    Leftover Funds: $562

With the new budget, I am reaching the cap for a Roth IRA of 5500 per year, with 211.53 removed every paycheck. My leftover funds are kept in the bank, and used to roughly determine how much I can put towards vacations or entertainment. 

I have an emergency fund of 8000 in a savings account, plus ~4000 in a checking account, which is where my paycheck goes into, and from which I pay rent and bills, and pay off my credit card (In full every month). I consider my month to be healthy when the checking goes over 5000 and an unhealthy month if it dips below 3500.

By my calculations, this means I am putting aside 13.9% of my paycheck (pretax) into the Roth IRA. Then an additional 3% into a 401K which is matched by my employer. So 16.9% retirement fund. 

If this plan is solid, then I next need to know how to open an IRA account. I know people here mention Vanguard a lot. Is that an account I can set up to get money deposited directly from my paycheck into the IRA? I presume I need to ask my HR department how they set that up internally after the account is created. 

Any advice or criticisms are welcome. I've had a good 2016, but I didn't put very much money into retirement. So I want to remedy that now. I'm turning 25 in 2017, so I don't feel like I am in dire straits for retirement. But I want to get ahead of that curve now.

Thanks so much!",finance,1482160315

personalfinance,"Which student loan(s) to pay first: lower balance with high interest, or higher balance with lower interest?","Hi everyone - first time poster here in PF. Great community here, thank you to everyone who contributes to this sub and makes it what it is.

My 2017 New Year's resolution is to finally start putting an extra $250 each month (all I can afford) into my $160k student loan debt (all undergrad; dropped out a semester with no refund). My question is which loan to apply my extra payment to; I have 3 unsubsidized Stafford loans ranging from $2,200 - $2,454, each with a 6.55% interest rate. I have 3 private loans (all variable rates), and the 2 with the highest interest rates are $12,956 at 4.6% or a $23,431 with 5.35% (note: the latter here is on a 224 month term). FYI - the third private loan is half of my debt, a refinanced $81,686 loan with 4.55%.

How should I allocate the extra monthly payment? Into the smallest balance with the highest rate, or the higher balance with slightly lower rates?

personalfinance,How much to invest in employer stock plan,"Employee Stock Purchase Plan details:
- Can contribute 0 to 10% of gross pay, including bonus and employer 401k contribution (for me this would be around 10K).
- They withhold the money from my check and use it to purchase the stock at the end of the six-month period.
- The stock is purchased at 85% of the stock price on the lower of first or last day of the six month period (so a minimum of 15% discount but could be more).

Here is what I have already done based on the advice of this subreddit:
Step one: Emergency fund.  DONE.

Step two: Max out employer-sponsored matching funds (in my case 1:1 matching up to 4.5%).  DONE.

Step three: Pay down high interest debts.  My highest interest rate is 3.8% for one of my student loans (11K), and 1% for my other student loan (39K) and auto loan (24K).  Since these are not considered high-interest debts I am currently just making my normal monthly payments on all.

Step four.  Max out IRA.  I am currently only partially funding it, about $200 per month.  I would like to max it out but I also want to take advantage of the stock purchase plan.  

I work for a solid blue chip tech company.  They have also been averaging 3.5% annual dividends and it's paid quarterly.

The two most financially savvy people I know are split on this.  One says max out the Roth and do 5-7% in the stock plan and the other says max out the stock plan and contribute the leftovers to the roth.  I have about 12K in my budget to allocate.

Also, I am 29 years old and currently rent but I would like to buy a home in a year or two.  I am married and my husband is self-employed but he has some health problems and I don't want to overcommit our income in case and he had to stop or cut down.

personalfinance,Getting back on track: I've made a plan based off the PF Wiki - looking for feedback.,"Hey everyone. I’ve been a lurker here and I’ve read a lot of threads that have helped me in my current situation. I read through the wiki pages and tried to get a grasp on what I need to do to get myself on track. Now that I’ve done that and have tried to tighten up my budget, I’ve put together a plan to the best of my ability, but I’d really like some feedback on my situation and plan. Also, some advice on rebuilding my credit would be great. I apologize ahead of time for the length of the post and the amount of info provided, but I want to make sure there is enough here for you to give me some good feedback.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Short back story:**  
I went off to college a responsible A+ student with some established credit history who had never been in trouble or in to drugs and ended up getting addicted to heroin which destroyed my life and ravaged my finances. (got injured, got prescribed percocet, that led to oxy, that led to heroin, that led to selling everything I owned, maxing out credit cards, selling everything I bought with those cards, spending all of my student loan living expense money and requesting more, committing bank/check fraud, dropping out from college with only 2 months left to go, becoming homeless and disowned from my family, living in my car, selling my car, living on the beach, stealing from people I loved, going to jail for said things). It’s been 6 years since I started rebuilding my life from ruble and I’m at the point now where it’s time to get focused on saving for the future.  

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the details of my situation...  

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: I am 28, single, no kids and I have insurance through my employer which pays for medical, dental, vision, medical bridge, long term disability then there are voluntary supplementals such as accident, cancer, critical illness, short term disability and life insurance. I pay about $100/mo for all of the above. I realize critical illness and cancer is not necessary but it's a piece of mind and at $100/mo for everything I feel it adds comfort to my life.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Cash &amp; Investment Accounts**  
&amp;nbsp;

* **(3) TD Convenience Checking Accounts: $1,500** - 1 for automatic monthly bills, 1 for my day to day budget (food/gas/supplies) and 1 for direct deposit and check deposits which I use to allocate to other accounts. This account is also where the “left overs”, or what I pay myself, sit for small purchases, entertainment, etc. Required $100 minimum balances (or $15/mo maintenance fee). I plan to keep $1000 minimum in each and automatically have my spreadsheet subtract $1000 from each so I only see what is “available”. I keep this much in them for an extra layer of protection for overdrafting or accidently using the wrong card and also for immediate emergency funds ($3,000 equals a little more than 1 month of expenses). So far this has been working great for me (I am very reckless and compulsive with my spending). Out of sight out of mind. 
Currently I have $500 minimum in each, which is halfway to my goal of $3,000  
* **(1) Ally Savings Account (1% APR): $0** - I have not started contributing to this yet but it will be where I deposit the rest of my emergency funds. (I guess this is a partially “tiered” emergency fund since a portion of it is in my checking?)  
* **TD Ameritrade Roth IRA: $50** - I just opened it with a small initial deposit  
* **TD Ameritrade Individual Brokerage: $0** - I don’t plan to use this account until I have everything else squared away and extra money to invest. So... probably not for a very long time. (I opened it awhile ago not really knowing what I was doing which is why it exists)  

&amp;nbsp;

**Credit Cards**  
&amp;nbsp;

* **TD Cash secured credit line ($500, $0 balance)** - Opened almost 3 months ago. Graduation will be possible. Used for work expenses that I get reimbursed for every paycheck (mostly gas and parking) - mostly stayed below 30%   
* **Discover it secured credit line ($200, $0 balance)** - On its way in the mail. Graduation will be possible  
* **USBank H-D secured credit line ($300, $0 balance)** - On its way in the mail. Graduation will be possible  
* I have ~~2~~ 1 outstanding application~~s~~ for a CitiBank secured card ~~and a USBank Harley Davidson secured card.~~  

&amp;nbsp;

**Debts**  
&amp;nbsp;

* **Federal Student Loans: $18,325** - Defaulted somewhere between 2010-2012. I am currently paying $14/mo right now to rehabilitate the loan (should be done with the program around May ‘17 and then start repayment). I expect my minimum payment to be around $215/mo for 10 years at about 6.8% APR. This is currently the only thing reported on my credit as delinquent/late and I expect it to come off and then show again up as a new loan in good standing once rehabilitated. (do federal student loans report when they are in good standing?)  
* **Private Student Loans: Around $100,000** - (partially a product of my addiction and partially a product of making the horrible decision to go to an expensive private for profit college) - My Dad cosigned these loans and has been paying them. I am so very fortunate for this. I have offered to help with what I can but he would rather me take care of everything else. I feel horrible, but he makes very good money and he is willing and able, so it is what it is. He just consolidated these so they will be coming off my credit report soon. (will this help or hurt my credit? 9ish years of on time payments and credit history will be gone, but $100,000 in burden of debt will also be gone)  
* **New Car Loan: $17,750 (0% for 60 months)** - I got this loan through Ford Credit about 2 months ago (post bankruptcy). I got a letter in the mail from the dealership that had a program to help people rebuild credit. Since I needed a new car anyway and I figured it would look good for rebuilding credit I said what the hell, but only if its a great deal. With a trade-in they originally came back with close to 10% APR and I noped on out the door (but was still surprised I was approved for anything). They called me the next day and said they got me 3%, but I still said no thanks. They called me the next day and said they got me 0%... I’m not sure how this happened, or if it was a good decision or not, but it is nice to have a reliable new car with a warranty while rebuilding my credit. So I guess I am happy with my decision. Originally my payment was going to be $308 for 60 months but I added an extended warranty which I decided the next day was a bad investment for my particular situation and cancelled it for a full refund. What I didn’t know is that the refund only credits my current account balance and doesn’t reduce the payment so now my payment is $358 for basically 51-51 months. Current Car value is between $15,000-$16,000  

&amp;nbsp;

**Earnings &amp; Expenses**  
&amp;nbsp;

* Monthly Gross: $4,395 (including bonuses)  
* Monthly Net: $3,415 (after insurance deductions and taxes)  
* Monthly Expenses 1: $2,380 (without student loan repayment - will start around May ‘17)  
* Monthly Expenses 2: $2,595 (assuming $215/mo for student loan repayment)  
* Available 1: $1,035/mo (now)  
* Available 2: $820/mo (May ‘17 forward)  

&amp;nbsp;

**Chapter 7 Bankruptcy**  
&amp;nbsp;

* Filled: 2/6/16  
* Resolved: 5/6/16  
* Tens of thousands of credit card/medical debt and a repossessed motorcycle were discharged  

&amp;nbsp;

**Credit Scores**  
&amp;nbsp;

* Credit Karma: 637/633  
* Credit Sesame: 642  
* Experian: 629  
* Capital One CreditWise: 631  
* Mint: 588  
* Discover Credit Scorecard: 621  

&amp;nbsp;

**After reading the Wiki page I’ve come to understand this should be my path of priorities:**  
&amp;nbsp;

* Pay minimum payments on debt - **check**  
* Save 1 month emergency fund - **½ way there**  
* ~~Match employer contribution to 401k~~ - **not available to me**  
* Pay off high interest debts - **~~will my 6.8% student loans fall in this category? If so,~~ should I increase the payment so I can have it (6.8% student loans) paid off in less than 5 years along with my car? (after some math this would be around $465/mo to have it paid off the same month I pay my car off and save me about $5,000 in interest)**  
* Increase emergency fund to 3 months  
* ~~Pay off moderate interest debts - **or will my 6.8% student loans fall in this category? Same question about increasing payment**~~  
* Max annual contribution to IRA  
* Savings for education - **I may take some online courses at my local state college in the near future**  
* ~~Increase 401k contribution so total retirement contributions are 15-20% of pre-tax earnings - **since a 401k is not available to me right now, this is where the Individual Brokerage account would come in, right?**~~  
* Contribute to taxable investment account (Individual Brokerage account?) ~~so total retirement contributions are 15-20% of pre-tax earnings~~ **is there a % of income that should be invested in retirement between this and an IRA if a 401k is not available?**  
* ~~Max HSA~~ - **not available to me**  
* Invest in savings, CD’s or i-bonds for short-term goals - **I’d like to buy a house in about 5 years, should this be higher on the list? ~~Maybe above increasing retirement contributions to 15-20%? Pretty sure I won’t be saving enough for a house in 5 years with everything I need to do.~~ What do you recommend?**  
* Retire early - **I WISH!**  

&amp;nbsp;

So basically right now my understanding is that I should continue to increase my emergency fund as much as possible until my student loan enters repayment (I should be able to reach my goal of 1 month - $3,000 by then, at least). Then I should either A) start aggressively paying down my student loans, or B) increase emergency fund to 3 months. From there I will max contribution to my IRA and either A) start saving for a house or B) increase retirement savings into a taxable investment account.  

&amp;nbsp;

Side questions:  
- It is currently being reported that I have 27+ accounts which is showing as a good thing for my score(?). How long until that number drops to only my active accounts and how bad will that hurt my score?  
- It is my understanding it is best to invest in a 3-fund portfolio: Total US Stocks, Total International Stocks, Total Bonds (ETF's). In my current situation, when I am able to start investing, is there a different route you would recommend and why?

personalfinance,Can a home equity loan save you money if you use it to pay off you credit cards?,"I was looking at who holds our mortgage (Navy Fed Credit Union) and noticed that they have home equity loans and lines of credit. 

We have been chipping away at our credit card debt since December of last year. I read on investopedia that home equity loans are like a second mortgage and the interest can be deducted on your taxes (if you itemize).

I'm trying to gauge if this is a good idea or not. From what I'm reading, we could get a home equity loan, trade out credit card debt for the home equity loan (so lower interest rates) and then also get to deduct whatever interest we pay on the home equity loan on our taxes. I was in the tax industry for a bit so I know that it is limited to reducing taxable income. 

Also it looks like NFCU has a special offer right now where they pay the majority of the closing fees so long as the loan is not paid off within the first three years plus a 0.25% if we setup auto pay (which is how we pay for practically everything). 

Could this save us money?

P.S. - We have broken the spending cycle on credit cards and have been using YNAB for about a year now, so I'm not worried about us starting to use the cards again. The bulk of the credit card debt was from my SOs divorce where he left her everything and started over on credit and a poor routine of paying on them.

If I had been a better husband I would have switched our ARM to a fixed rate two months ago... but I didn't, and I'm not. Now interest rates are up and we've got a hard decision to make.

Some background:

3 years into a seven year ARM on a 600k loan at 3.25%

Wife and I each make enough to cover the mortgage alone, but would be hard, and I'm thinking of quitting/making much less money soon

Some options for us given by lender were - pay another 150k, have low rate and lower principal and lower monthly payments - switch to the new higher rate and have a higher monthly payment - keep with the ARM and refinance in four years.

We have the cash/stocks to do this, but we would then have over half of our wealth in our home. Also I want to make a big life change soon, kid + moving abroad for a couple years + having less high paying jobs.

Today, I went in to open a checking account so I could have access to a debit card, so I wouldn't be using/maxing out my credit card.

personalfinance,Vanguard or other business vs. bank IRA -- Negatives?,"I'm thinking about getting a Vanguard plain/traditional IRA.  More details and reasons in my other threads.

When I first thought about an IRA, someone told me not to look at a bank.  Banks have lower interest rates.  A place like Vanguard is a better deal.  So I looked there.  People mentioned Vanguard here, so I picked that one.  I wanted to get something moving.  I've my account set up now.  I think I just need to drop money in it.

But then another person told me to be careful, to use a bank for an IRA.  Why?  Because an IRA with a bank is federally insured.  I can't lose my money.  If I get one through Vanguard, I might lose my money.

Maybe that's true, but... I'm thinking a bank is something like 1% interest, not even keeping up with inflation.  The money loses value.  Plus I end up having to save more in the long-long run.  I'll have locked my money up until retirement but with that low of an interest rate, it's not so different from just keeping it in an accessible savings account.  I think Vanguard was 9 or 11% interest too.  Yes, that could change, but...  What else am I supposed to do with money for retirement?  I saw the slider where Vanguard makes it more and more conservative the closer you get to a target retirement date.  That made sense.  What else are you supposed to do?  Save with a 100% guarantee but little generated from interest?  Is that realistic?

personalfinance,"How to handle non-emergency, non-retirement additional savings?","I've been lurking here and other forums discussing handling income/savings/retirement and am trying to follow the basic steps for saving and retirement but have a question in regards to what to do with additional savings:

As a little background, my wife and I are in our late 20s with a combined income of about $160k/year. We work in dissimilar industries so we assume it's unlikely we would both be unemployed at the same time but we have an emergency fund of about $20k in case shit really hit the fan and we found ourselves both unemployed at the same time. 

We both contribute to our 401ks the maximum amount that our companies match (note: not maximum allowed annually). We have a single car payment of about $420/month with an essentially negligible interest rate and nowhere near being upside down on it as well as about a $150/month (~$14,000 balance) student loan. Other than that, good credit scores, credit cards paid off every month, etc.

So here's where I'm confused on what the best approach is: I read that you should be putting money in a low-risk (read: savings) account if you plan on using it in the next 3-5 years. We live in an area in which the median home price is $500,000 so we would need at least $100,000 cash before having a good down payment on a house in the future. 

But here's the thing, it wouldn't be absolutely necessary to buy a house in that time frame - if we had to push back the plan to buy a year or two, it wouldn't be the end of the world. So is it a really terrible idea to invest the additional savings (amount over emergency fund) in a brokerage account knowing that if the economy went under at the time that we would be planning to buy, it wouldn't be a huge deal to have to wait a couple years for it to recover before making the plunge into buying a home? Or is it really a stupid idea to not just hoard all that money as cash in a savings account?

Sorry if this has been discussed before. All I see is: if you want to make a big purchase in the next five years, put money into savings. Otherwise, pay off all debt and/or put money towards retirement. But what about if you're okay with putting off that big purchase if it was required? Is it then worth it to invest that savings to hope to make money on the interest knowing that you could just delay the big purchase assuming that after a couple years it would recover?

My wife and I are trying to do a good balance of enjoying life in the present and building up a decent retirement for the future without going full blown frugal (especially because if literally everything hit the fan, we have social safety nets: selling all expensive belongings and moving back in with family members or something - if that happened, the entire country would likely have to be in turmoil though so it's not really a huge concern).

personalfinance,Am I on the right track? How can I improve?,"Looking for a critique on my planning and current financial situation. Also seeking advice on areas of improvement.

**Background info:**  

I am a 31 year old from Oklahoma with a wife and 12 year old son. I spent 12 years in the Army before I was hurt and subsequently discharged. I currently am a full time student and a federal employee.

**Income:**

I make 36k/year from my job and take home 2k every month. This is AFTER my 10% contribution to a Thrift Savings Plan. (Fed gov matches up to 6%) I also take home 34k from my military retirement. My wife makes abour 1400 a month, take home.

**Debts:**

I owe 125k on a house, 13000 on a car and 6500 on a motorcycle.

**Investments and Savings:**

I'm contributing 10% of my federal job income to a TSP. I have a few thousand in a Roth IRA for this year, and plan on maxing those contributions by April. I have just over 10k in savings which is, i think, enough for a 6 month emergency fund.


**Plan:**

As it stands now, I plan on bumping my TSP contributions to 43% for all of next year, unless I get some better advice. I am also going to max my Roth IRA with help of my tax returns. I've been putting around 1000 in savings every month since I began to really get into planning for my future. I've also been putting on average 500 extra towards principle on my house.

That's about all I have, though.

Is there anything I am missing? If I stay federal, I am able to retire with a pension in just under 25 years. I'll be around 55 then. I'm not trying to be rich, but I would like to be able to kick back and relax while I can still get around and have energy.

personalfinance,Utilizing extended payment plan to assist with Avalanche method for student loan repayment.,"Greetings! I am in student loan repayment hell and currently putting everything I have to paying off my student loan debt of over $250,000. Some of this is federal and some private. I've been paying on this for the past two years on the standard repayment plan and am targeted to pay it off after 10 years. I'm putting $3000 toward these loans each month, which is a significant portion of my income. I work a standard 40 hour job and also have a second job that I work in a relief manner. Recently I saved a small emergency fund of $1500 and lowered my 401k and HSA contributions just to the match. With the extra $400 a month I've been using the snowball method to help keep my motivation up. I'm expecting a large bonus every 6 months intended for student loan repayment that I negotiated with my primary job, that will be utilized for the avalanche method, which will help, but it's still just a drop in the bucket. I don't plan on lowering what I am paying as I want to be done with this debt as soon as possible. Has anyone increased their term on their federal loans to the 25 year plan to lower minimum payments on the loans with a lower interest rate in order to increase payments to the high interest loans for the avalanche method? I've been considering this to get rid of some of the private loans faster and also to decrease my monthly minimum payment requirements in case of emergency. Any thoughts or experiences with this?

Last year, I made 55,000 and only had student loan interests to deduct ( 2,500). I claim 0  on my taxes so I pay the most in order to get a larger return. I received 3,000 back in taxes last year. 

This year, I bought a duplex using a 203k FHA loan. 66k for the duplex and 30k in repairs for a mortgage total of 96k. I live in one side and rent out the other. I rent out one side for 925. I pay 1500/yr in taxes and 1,500/yr in insurance. 

Student Loans- 2,500 in interests paid.

New Car- 1700 in taxes paid.

financialindependence,Pros and cons of marriage for the FI minded couple with kids,"I wanted to think through the pros and cons of getting married for the FI minded couple who has or plans to have kids.  Here's what I've come up with so far:

&amp;nbsp;

Pros of not getting married:

&amp;nbsp;

1. If both parents earn similar salaries, Federal taxes are lower.

&amp;nbsp;
2. At least one parent could file as head of household, presumably whoever had the higher salary (further reducing Federal taxes)

&amp;nbsp;
3. If you had more than one child, and each parent had full custody of one child, each parent could max out a DCFSA (2x $5k) and a family HSA (2x $6.7k)

&amp;nbsp;
4. Ability to take advantage of some one time offers (e.g. I was never a homeowner before I married, and if we were unmarried I could have bought ""her"" house during 2009 and received an $8k tax credit).

&amp;nbsp;
5. The tIRA phaseout is only $98k for MFJs, but $61k for singles.

&amp;nbsp;

Cons of not getting married:

&amp;nbsp;
1. Things would get real ugly if the couple split. The mother, who would normally have custody of all kids, may not have custody of the kid who she let the other parent take custody of. Because only one person owns the home, the owner could kick the other parent to the curb.

&amp;nbsp;
2. Each parent would have to pay their portion of a medical insurance premium for a n+1 plan or perhaps a family plan if there were more than one kid in the custody of a single parent. Note: Some have mentioned that a partner in an unwed couple can be covered under the other partner's incurance; I'm ignorant in this area so I will not comment.

&amp;nbsp;
3. If one parent earned significantly more than the other the Federal tax burden would be higher. At that point you could marry :)

&amp;nbsp;
4. If one parent is hospitalized or dies the other parent may not have visitation rights and the inheritance may not go as planned (presumably this would be addressed with a medical power of attorney and will, but I am not a lawyer).

&amp;nbsp;
5. Some pensions may not be inheritable by an unwed partner.

&amp;nbsp;

What other pros and cons are there?

&amp;nbsp;

My situation:

&amp;nbsp;

Two spouses earning similar amounts, with two kids, making too much to contribute to a tIRA as MFJs but not as singles. I calculate about $6k in tax savings (yay!), minus $3k in health insurance premiums (boo!) for a net gain of $3k/year; plus a one time gain of $8k if we were unmarried in 2009 (homewowner tax credit).

&amp;nbsp;

personalfinance,Should I let debt go to collections?,"Hello, I'm looking for advice and would appreciate any help. I have a $980 debt from May this year from overdraft fees on an account with my old bank. I had made a couple payments to the bank after the account closed, but due to car troubles and credit card debt, I stopped making payments toward this for a while. First let me say, I am NOT looking to find out how to avoid paying this - I am trying to prioritize what to pay. 

So I received a notice from a collection agency and I disputed the debt. I did this in order to buy myself time because I knew I'd be getting $1200 at the end of this month from a gig and could then use this to pay off the debt. The debt is not on my credit report yet. My only concern is I have $9000 in credit card debt on 4 different cards, all close to being maxed out, that I wish I could put the cash toward instead. 

Initially I wanted to use the extra cash to pay this debt before it goes to collections. My plan was to write them a pay-for-delete (or non-reporting) letter and once I got their response, I would then send a check (assuming they agree). I am wondering if I should instead let this debt go to collections and use the extra cash toward my credit cards (high interest rate of 20%). I will be taking classes until the summer, so I can only afford to put $300/month toward my credit card debt and can't get another job. I feel like putting the extra money toward my credit cards now would give me a boost and I won't be as crushed under interest. This means I won't be able to start payments toward my $980 debt until the summer, and it would probably take me until the end of the year to pay it off. Should I choose this option and wait to pay this debt until after it's in collections? I don't want it on my credit report 7 years, but I am wondering if I could request a pay-for-delete after it's on my report instead of now. Obviously I understand I'm risking more there and that they could refuse. But maybe this debt $980 would not look as bad on my credit report as my maxed out credit cards of $9000 do. 

I'm at a loss because money is so tight right now and I just want to tackle my debt the best way possible. Please help me decide what to pay-I'd greatly appreciate it!!",finance,1482259503

It's hard to trust the guy trying to sell me the refinance package. 

**Starting balance (30 year FHA @ 3.625%): $272,585.xx - Loan began July, 2012**

**Remaining balance $244,348.28**

**Min. payment: $1990.41**

**Principal and Interest: $1,243.13/month**

**Shortage (escrow catch-up): $38.13/month**


I spoke to a Wells Fargo refinancing agent about removing the MIP and now have the following details assuming the house appraises at $312,000.00. I expect it to appraise closer to $330,000.00.

**Refinance for a 20 year at 4.25% - Total payment $2,025/month (no MIP)**

**Out of pocket expenses: $533.00 (credit check and appraisal)**

**$2,000.00 - 5,000.00 closing costs - rolled into mortgage**


Future projections:


**Current loan (2 years out) principal balance $232,609**

**Refinanced loan (2 years out) principal balance: $221,563**


**Current loan (5 years out) principal balance: $213,328**

**Refinanced loan (5 years out) principal balance: $204,140**


At face value it seems like 5 years out, after refinancing, we would have saved $14,133.00 in MIP payments and our principal balance would be lower. What concerns me is, if we stay longer than 5 years, the value of refinancing drops because we would eventually reach 78% of the loan naturally and out MIP would drop (May, 2021). If we refinance, we rolled the cost of refinancing into the loan and now have a higher interest rate. 

So now I turn to you, /r/personalfinance, for your always excellent advice. Thanks!

personalfinance,"Offered a loan for a (used) car at 3.74% for 36 months, is this decent?","Hey /r/PF, 

This is my first car purchase. I'm fully employed and have enough income to cover the loan. My credit score is good (CreditKarma says 736 for TransUnion and 726 for Equifax), but I haven't had a car loan before. I applied to Credit Union of Texas and was approved at 3.74% for 36 months or 4.04% for 60 months.

Is this a decent rate, or should I shop around more? What's the easiest way to do so, since applying puts a credit check on my credit score (I believe that some credit bureaus may combine multiple checks?)?

The loan is for $10k (looking at cars in the $10-13k range), I have enough in savings to almost cover the cost in cash, but I've been told that since interest rates are low it would be best to borrow the money and make the payments (to build credit) while investing the rest, does this sound right?

EDIT: I applied to another lender (LightStream through SunTrust bank) and was approved for 2.74% for 36 months.",finance,1482275808
personalfinance,Financing Medical School,"Hello /r/pf. I am trying to consider my options when it comes to financing medical school come fall 2017. 
Over the last couple years with a well paying job and good saving habits I have saved about 100k in tax advantaged accounts (mix of traditional and Roth) and about 75k in after tax brokerage accounts/cash. 

The way I see it my options are:

Source 1 is of course federal loans, which have a current rate of ~5.3% (unsubsidized), which is not tooooo awful. 

Source 2 is saved up cash/after tax investments (I have already sold any losses for the year to harvest the losses during this year with my higher tax rate, and would consider selling winners next year to pay lower CG taxes.)

Source 3 is penalty free hardship withdrawals from traditional IRAs where I would pay income tax but not penalty since education expenses are a covered hardship reason. This seems great because I saved on taxes during my high income years and will be withdrawing during low income years. Even if I didn't withdraw this money I would convert it to a Roth during the low income years. The only downside i see is giving up on year of tax deferred growth in the middle. 

Source 4 is Roth withdrawals which are of course tax and penalty free up to the amount of contributions, then I would pay income tax but not penalties for any earnings (I'm not 100% clear on if withdrawn earnings for education expenses would be taxed) 

My inclination is to first use non-retirement savings unless I qualify for low interest loans through the school, but where I'm struggling is deciding between tapping into retirement funds to pay for school vs taking loans. I'm hesitant to pull from retirement funds just because they have great legal protections should anything happen to me and I couldn't pay back my loans, and more simply because once you deplete those savings you can only build them back up at the rate allowed by the govt. ""You use it you lose it"" basically.

Overall I am thankful to have money to contribute towards school, but I was hoping /r/Pf could help me prioritize my financing options. Thank you!",finance,1482277397

Personal Debt and Income Stats:

-~70k student loans

-~2k medical debt

Credit and Assets Stats:
-~$5k liquid in my checking account

-~$120 or so in medical bills

-student loans are still in deferment for 6 months, but when I start paying I intend to put at least ~$800 toward each month

-$100 in the broad category of entertainment



I have three main questions, but feel free to give any other advice that might pertain to my situation.

First, I want to get another credit card in order to improve my credit and serve as an emergency account. I would probably pay my groceries on that card and try to just keep utilization low. 

However, I'm hesitant to apply- last year, with a credit score of ~580, I got denied for like 3 applications before I realized that you're not supposed to apply for a bunch of stuff at once. Is a ~660 credit score strong enough for a Chase Freedom or similar card? What sort of card would yall recommend I go for?

Second, I am looking into getting a used car. I have never had a car before and am unaware of total expenses related to owning one. I have settled on a used Honda Civic from the mid 00's, which goes for $7-9k from a reputable dealer around here. I could put a few grand on a down payment but would also like to partially finance to both reduce that burden and improve my score.

What are the costs that a first-time car owner doesn't think about? How much would car-related expenses be on average per month, considering that it would be used almost exclusively for my short ~8 mile commute?

Finally, I was looking at refinancing my student loans. I have like 10 separate loans and most of them are at a 6.8% interest rate. I was going to throw $1.2k at the smallest one to pay it off then try to combine all of the student loans into one large loan with a lower rate. 

Is there a certain time I should try to refinance? Should I pay off that smaller loan first, or just throw that into the mix as well? What sites do you recommend for this sort of thing?

Thanks for reading my incredibly long post, and thanks in advance for any advice you might have.",finance,1482283517
personalfinance,My experience closing on my first home,"I closed on my first home purchase yesterday, a co-op apartment. I'm writing this post not to gloat, but rather to share my experience with others who are considering home buying. I was very much afraid of getting ripped off, going broke, or not having enough money to own a home before I bought my apartment. The process seemed daunting and scary. My experience was anything but, primarily due to the team working for me on the purchase. Hopefully what I've learned can help others find their way to happy and financially stable home ownership.

Here are the basics of the deal (financials are rounded off to protect my identity):

* Days from offer to close: 126
* Cash on hand going in: $31,000
* **Purchase price: $240,000**
* **Percent down: 10%**
* Percent down ($): $24,000
* Credit score: above 740
* Interest rate: 3.5% original / 3.625% after credit
* Lender credit: $1,700
* **Monthly all-in including maintenance and PMI: $1,850**
* Attorney's fee: $2,500
* **Final closing costs (including attorney): $7,000**

**What are some things I did right without realizing it:**

*Dedicated savings account:* I opened a dedicated savings account with another bank several years ago. A percentage of my paycheck has been deposited via direct deposit automatically every pay cycle. I never touch this account, except in emergencies. This made it very easy for my lender to audit my income, confirm I wasn't getting money from sources other than my job, explain any spending at all (because there was none), and calculate whether or not I had enough cash on hand to afford buying the apartment.

*Hire an experienced attorney:* Seems obvious, but I did not fully understand the value of an experienced attorney until the very end. I assumed attorney's just read stuff for you to sign. Their role is actually much larger. Mine handled title searches, financial statement reviews, maintaining communication with all parties, scheduling, calculating billing, and process guidance. Everything went smoothly, even the problem-solving. My attorney had worked for a friend on two closings and was recommended by my friend.

**What are some things I could have done better:**

*Paid closer attention to my tax returns:* Both my lender and the co-op required copies of the last three years of my federal tax returns. The co-op required *full* copies, not just transcripts which can be ordered in a few days. There were two issues with this: (1) I didn't have them and (2) they had errors. This caused the most stress during the entire process. I should have gotten this squared away in June while I was looking around for a place to buy instead of panicking in September when the co-op started asking for them.

**What would be my advice to a first-time home buyer:**

*Pick the best possible team.* I picked my real estate agent, attorney, and mortgage broker carefully. Home buying takes time. It requires a lot of patience and gets very emotional at times. My team did an excellent job keeping me focused and calm throughout. We finished the job and I got the place I wanted for an affordable price. It took an extra long time due to the seller's attorney's incompetence, which is not anything you can control. But the deal was worth it for me to stick it out. So I did, and now I'm loving this apartment. I wish you the best of luck on your journey!",finance,1482283921

personalfinance,Can't decide on which house to buy.,"I have $20,000 to do various things with.  My difficulty is in deciding if I should buy house A, which is new and needs zero work or House B which requires work.  To complicate it, I have 29k in student loans I'd like gone.  

Interest rate would be 4% on mortgage, 30 year fixed.  

House A: $195,000 and needs zero work.  If I purchased this house I would just take the 20k saved and use it as a down payment.  

House B: $157,000 but requires about 30-35k in updates (flooring, carpet, countertops, etc).  

Student Loan: $29,000 at 3.55%. 

My options are to buy house A and use the 20k savings as a down payment.  I could buy house B and use about 5k as a down payment and 15k to do some of the renovations, while saving for later renovations.  I could also buy house B, use the 20k as down payment and take out a renovation loan for 30k to do all the renovations up front.  At the same time as these options, every dollar I spend on a down payment, renovation, or saving for a renovation is a dollar I cannot put towards my student loan.  Our annual gross income is about $115,000.  I am interested in knowing how to do this for the lowest total cost, and also how to do this with the lowest monthly cash flow.

personalfinance,Paying Parents for Car Loan,"Hey personalfinance,

First time posting here! 
So I have an arrangement with my parents where Father made the initial down payment on a 2014 Silverado. 5k down into a 40k Loan, by trading in one of his older vehicles. With interest, the loan becomes 46k for the 60 months/5-years timespan I plan on paying it off.   

&amp;nbsp;

Current approach: 

Car is still in Father's name, but I send him a check each month for $700 that goes towards the car loan. I plan on continuing to do so until the car is paid off in the distant future. After which, he plans on just giving me the title.  

&amp;nbsp;

Context: 

- I'm a 23-year old post grad student with no student loans. Currently at a stable job that provides me with a take home of 3200/month (after taxes). 

- Current credit score is in the high 700's, always keeping spending and saving habits below what my paychecks can bear.

-  I didn't believe I would have been able to secure the car with a lower interest rate, so we figured father should have the car in his name.

- The only other major overhead I have is rent at 900/month. Leaving the remainder for groceries/gas/gym/utilities.

- Coming from a good family and my relationship with both parents are very strong. No chance in them pocketing my checks.  

&amp;nbsp;

Discussion Question(s):


- Is this I-pay-father-who-then-pays-bank approach the lowest cost way to pay off the car?

- Is there truth in letting my father take on the car-loan, figuring his  established credit history would garner a lower interest?

- Is this way of paying off the car building credit history for me?

- If it's not building credit history, what can I do with my future payments to build credit history?",finance,1482289998

I'm late on my payments.  I was in forbearance until October, and that was my last month of forbearance.  This completely fell off my radar.  I owe $390 per month, and though I can finally afford that, I can't afford the past due amount.  I have other bills that I need to pay, and I'm freaking out.

I can't send extra every month.  I want to switch to a different plan with a lower monthly payment until I get my other debt paid off, which should be by the end of 2018 (ironically I have a plan for this debt payoff that is going swimmingly), and then switch to the standard repayment so I'm not paying this off into retirement.  They want me to pay 3 months of the $390 before they switch me into a lower payment of $191.  

Is there any way to fix this, or am I going to have to figure out a way to come up with a lump sum of the past due amount?

Personal loan?,"Yep, she's halfway becoming an RN (2 of 4 semesters completed) but now tells me she needs 1800 for fees for the 3rd semester. There's no avenues of student aid or anything like that, it's one of those deals where shes on aid probation for a couple semesters or something, has to pay her own way for a bit before she can qualify again (from various school attempts before she got into nursing school). I believe the cutoff date that she needs the money by is Jan 7. She was pregnant and not working for about the last 9 months until a month ago (we work together at a warehouse job that is pretty physically demanding). She is quasi-married, but hubby is and always has been a  total idiot with money. They dont really have anything to sell, pawn etc (well, he has an Xbox, and motorcycle, but there's zero chance he would sell them, the Xbox is his life). Or anyone to borrow from.

There is a caveat, tax time is coming, and she told me she expects to get up to 6k back in tax returns. However, this will be too late to do any good. But the point is in theory she could pay back any loan with her tax return as soon as it arrives.

I'm trying to help her out with this, I suggested a personal loan. Years ago I attempted to get one myself from a traditional brick and mortar bank (I wanted to buy a cheap used truck and structure it as a personal loan instead of a car loan so i didn't have to pay full coverage insurance on the truck), I have stellar credit and was kind of laughed at. So, I figure there's zero chance for her at a traditional bank. However, when you google ""personal loan"" a zillion sites come up. I went through a few introductory questions at one, chose the worst possible credit score bracket they offered (as I assume her credit is) and seemed to go through fine. So I'm assuming it may be possible for her to do that. Of course the interest rate will be higher than a credit card, but she doesn't have options. And remember in theory it's just a lifeline for a few weeks till her taxes come in.

So, my questions are, is it actually possible for someone with no collateral and poor credit to get a personal loan for ~1800? Is there certain companies/websites that are known for being good ones?",finance,1482312469

* Vivint's numbers are all estimated for now, they're doing their site survey today. The internet also leads me to believe Vivint uses SolarEdge inverters, but I failed to ask their rep so I'm not sure.
* Direct Energy Solar is, in the contract, saying they will buy our SRECs for five years at $64 per SREC, guaranteed; based on their proposal this is the total we are guaranteed over five years.

Based on my energy usage calculations, they should all cover near to or more than 100% of our needs. SolarCity and Vivint might come in just under, the others will be over 100% (approximately 8,100 kWh/year). Average electricity bill is around $110/month.

Right now, it looks like Direct Energy Solar is our best option, but hoping for insight from experts here. I've done lots of research (at least I think I have), but I'm certainly no expert. In particular, some questions I have:

* I've read a lot about reliability regarding both SolarEdge and Enphase microinverters, both good and bad, but the bad seemed to be isolated to earlier generations of both products. What's the general feeling here about SolarEdge vs. Enphase?
* Shading is probably not an issue for us - we have one tree that *may* cast a very slight shadow towards the end of the day. In that case, I've read that a string inverter is the most cost-effective, but if the cost is similar to a microinverter system, is there a reason to lean towards string over microinverter?
* What I've read suggests the WINAICO panels are the best, but I haven't read anything terrible about Canadian Solar or Jinko. Any experience regarding the manufacturers and their panels?

Happy to provide more information if it helps (about warranties, monitoring, maintenance, financing terms, etc.). So far they all seem pretty competitive and comparable on their warranties and monitoring capabilities, though I'm led to believe SolarCity's monitoring will be the least informative due to the string inverter. Direct Energy Solar is also structuring their loan as one no interest loan for the value of the MD state grant and the Federal ITC, and the rest of the cost as a regular loan. That sounds like the best financing structure so far; SolarCity and Vivint are either total cost and payments based on 30% repayment within 18 months followed by reamortization, MSSI is pretty much on our own to find financing (HELOC, solar loans from a bank, beg for money, etc.).

Sorry for the wall of text, just trying to include as much information as possible. Thanks in advance for any thoughts and advice!",energy,1482335923

So lately I've seen a lot of threads where people were upset because their credit score was not rising very much even though it was totally fine (750+). I decided that we should once and for all determine what score is beneficial to have, and at what point do you get diminishing returns. So to review, here are the following tiers that we should discuss.

300 - 580: Horrible. Prepare for very high interest rates, or to be straight up denied. You'll probably have to settle with a ""secured"" credit card if you need a line of credit.

580 - 640: Getting there but still not great. You'll probably still have to suck up quite a bit of interest cost.

640 - 700: The average American. You can now qualify for standard interest rates and get approved for more credit cards/limit raises.

700 - 750: Nice! You will now start to qualify for better interest rates.

750 - 850: You've won the game of life, now keep it that way by making sure not to miss any payments! (Theory, any score above 750 will have diminishing returns. Is this true or false?)

Is this pretty accurate? Can someone provide any details I missed, or maybe delve into some real quotes as far as car loans/mortgages/APR on credit cards? Thanks you lovely people :)",finance,1482352859
Bitcoin,What is causing this rally?,"Keep in mind this is a conjecture, but with Gold or mainly PM'S doing so poorly and the recent interest rate hikes by the Fed, and the next 2 hikes which are already expected in 2017, the stock markets are all time highs and historically the markets and PM have had inverse relationships, my point is I have read over the years that bitcoin has performed a lot like gold in times of bank runs or the government effecting the currency of a respective country.


I'm leaning more towards speculation as the main driver for this current price rise, is this all just supply and demand, lowered inflation or as some might argue the rate of inflation has been cut in half the total supply remains the same or more users causing there to be less coins for everyone to share??

I'd like to hear more educated theories as I am only 31, my impression was bitcoin follows the same inverse relationship that PM'S seem to share with the stock markets of the world. An inverse one.

So I went to my local mall (for other things) and they have it at the GameStop there, as I'm checking out he trys to sell me on the insurance, and as he did he told me that once it was opened I couldn't return it. So why the fuck is something they open allowed to be sold as new but I can seriously open a brand new game in front of them and try to return it and they couldn't accept it because it wasnt new?

MachineLearning,[D] attention mechanism in current google neural translation model?,"I'm confused about the function of attention in the google model, as published in Johnson 2016.

Johnson says the model is like the one introduced in Bahdanau 2015. In Bahdanau, the attention is in a context vector which is fed into the decoder along with the output from the current encoder step. The context vector is the weighted sum of annotation vectors for each step of the input sequence. The weights are calculated through a separate feedforward network that takes as input the current outputs from low-level hidden layers in the recurrences. 

Johnson, though, says that the context vector is formed by passing the output from the lowest level of the decoder rnn through a separate feedforward network. This would imply that the weighted annotations are not being used. That also seems to be what's shown in the diagram, where the output from the attention mechanism is passed directly to each layer of the decoder lstm above the first.

Did Johnson mean to say that the annotation weight vector, rather than the context vector, is formed by passing the output from the lowest decoder lstm through a feed forward network? Am I totally misunderstanding this?",technology,1482359141
personalfinance,myRA as emergency fund,"Hi,

I've read through some of the discussions about using a Roth IRA to hold an emergency fund, including the risk that funds invested in a Roth IRA might lose their value at the very moment a withdrawal is required.

I recently came across [myRA](https://myra.gov/about/), a Roth IRA operated by the government which says that it is guaranteed not to lose value, and
&gt;myRA accounts earn interest at the same variable rate as investments in the Government Securities Investment Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. These investments earned 2.04 percent in 2015 and had an average annual return of 2.94 percent over the ten-year period ending December 2015. 

Here's my situation: I have no high-interest debt (some 4-6% student loans, otherwise a 3% car loan), ~1 month buffer using YNAB, no other emergency fund, no IRA, and I'm contributing the maximum that my employer will match in 401k. I also own a second car which could be sold to cover 1 month's worth of expenses.

I'd been trying to figure out whether my next goal should be either build an emergency fund (beyond the 1-month buffer) or build my IRA. I'd thought maybe I should set aside as much as possible until April 15, then put it into a traditional IRA and immediately use my refund to begin replenishing an emergency fund.

But now I'm thinking the better plan may be to set aside as much as possible until April 15, then put it all into myRA and consider that to be my emergency fund, at least for now, until I can build a bigger one in cash and then transfer the myRA funds to a more aggressive private IRA like a vanguard target date fund. This way I would still be able to put the max in for 2017 as well.

Does this seem like a reasonable plan? Paying off high-interest debt and building the buffer took all of last tax year and part of this one so this is the first one where this has even been a question.",finance,1482362388
personalfinance,VA requirements are causing my lender fits- and I work for the lender. Need advice.,"Let me first say that I work for a large bank in middle management. I recently got transferred to a branch about an hour from my current home. The wife and I decided to rent our condo we're currently living in and buy a second home in our new town using my VA benefit of less than 20% down. The payment won't be a problem, the property is gorgeous, my credit is glamorously high, and I can afford the payments on both properties provided I have a renter. Oh, and did I mention that I work for the bank?

But the bank just won't close the loan. 

A couple of weeks ago, my mortgage banker (who I work with regularly) told me we were just waiting on closing disclosures. At 4:54pm that same day, the underwriter comes back with several stipulations that had never been mentioned prior to that day. We sighed, resigned ourselves to having to wait a few more days to purchase our new house, and provided docs. Then, more stipulations came up. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

We're now three weeks past our original closing date, the underwriter is demanding sillier and sillier documents and tests (docs that worked before are now insufficient), and we are officially going to be homeless landlords in 7 days, unless the asinine water tests the underwriter requested come back faster than anyone seems to think they will. And God forbid that the water test doesn't come back sterling, or we'll be even more screwed.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just starting to feel like they don't want to give me the interest rate I locked at (3.0%), and are trying to push me into a conventional loan instead of a VA, all while claiming that the VA requires this information. Any prior experience with this, and any tips to circumvent these evil, last minute stipulations, would be incredibly helpful. 

EDIT: For anyone still interested, we finally got closing docs after I laid the screws on my underwriter's boss and threatened to claim discrimination due to my protected status as a veteran. I pulled the minority card and got closing docs; I... win?? God damn it, America.",finance,1482364043
personalfinance,"Did I encounter a ""shady"" car dealership? Any ADVICE??","I seen an ad for a 2017 model lease of $89 a month for the duration of 24 months. I scheduled a visit and met with a few people at the dealership. I encountered the usual tactics of a salesman (offer a drink, casual unrelated conversations, etc). 

He then wrote down a number that was close to $100 more than what I was willing to pay and made an ""unofficial"" contract (potential payment amount, followed by a x_________)  I signed a few documents that were basically a general agreement and was assured that it was not an official contract. I made it very clear that I don't agree to the price.

I guess this was just a ploy to see how resistant I would be to their potential offers. Anyway, they contacted 2 banks for the lease and I was denied by one of them. I was countered offered the same vehicle USED  with 10,000 miles already on the dash by another bank.  Here's the confusing part, I was offered an option to finance it with what the salesman called an ""awesome"" interest rate. I made it very clear I have no desire to finance anything because of the potential risks involved with such a commitment and I was much more comfortable leasing the vehicle.

I just don't understand how I was able to get approved for financing, yet denied for a lease. From my understanding, financing is MUCH riskier. Can someone please explain this to me!

I've been stuck these past days trying to figure out how to best allocate my extra money from living at home. I'm between two extremes. The first being maxing my 401k and continuing minimums on my loans, putting whatever leftover I have toward them monthly. The other extreme, which is suggested commonly, is throwing everything extra at the student loans. I currently max a Roth IRA and take the max match on my 401k. Here are my numbers:

&amp;nbsp;

**Savings:**    
Fidelity Regular 401k: $17,975    
Vanguard Roth IRA: $11,648 (with 2017 contribution ready to deposit on 1/1/2017)    
Emergency Fund in Ally Savings: $10,000 (~6 months of at-home expenses/3 of estimated city-living expenses)    

&amp;nbsp;
    
**Total Debt: ~$44,648:**

Nelnet Federal A: $7,311 @ 3.150%    
Nelnet Federal B: $6,507 @ 5.656%

Nelnet Federal D: $5,009 @ 4.410%    
Nelnet Federal E: $1,910 @ 4.410%    

&amp;nbsp;

I understand that paying more on my loans gives me an immediate and guaranteed return equivalent to the interest rate. Would it not be the case that maxing my 401k while I'm young would provide a greater return over my lifetime due to the compound interest that will accrue over the next 30+ years?    


I want to max it out, but want to make sure it makes sense before doing so? Can anyone provide some insight on why I shouldn't? Please let me know if any more details are needed to aid in guiding me. Thanks so much!

personalfinance,Trying to plan my post-graduation years as a pharmacist wanting to move,"So I'm going to pharmacy school at a private school in the midwest. Sooo student loans out the wazoo (6 years x $50k/year). My parents make decent money so I don't really get any government help besides the usual federal loans, and the loans are all in my name. So basically I'll graduate with tons of debt, but I'll make good money as a pharmacist.  I want to move to somewhere in Los Angeles. My mom says I should stay home after I graduate for a few years just to save money and work on my debt. Pharmacists here make ~$120k/yr, but I think it's a little more in LA.  I just feel like it will be hard to leave once I take a job here and have been here a few years. Would I be safe accepting a job in LA immediately after graduation? I have some family out there and my grandma has 2 extra bedrooms. I'm thinking I'll ask to stay with her for a month or so while I find a place to live. My last year is rotations and I'll have a month off, so that's when I want to visit out there and apply for jobs like crazy. What do you all think of my plan? Is it feasible? What do you recommend? Thanks!

Edit: So I'm gay and I've visited there before and fell in love with it. I think I'd have more of a chance to find love out there than in the Midwest.

personalfinance,"Have multiple tribal installment loans at once, and being eaten alive. What happens if I stop paying them?","22 year old (dumbass) male. I have been in a financial bind for a few months now, and due to a cycle of borrowing, being unable to repay, and having to borrow more, not to mention ridiculous interest rates,  have found myself being buried.

I currently have 3 active installment loans from online tribal lenders: Green Trust Cash, SpotLoan, and American Web Loan. I live in the state of Oregon.

The agreements all contain statements saying that the loan is from a business that resides within the jurisdiction ____ reservation, therefore is subject only to the laws of the _____ tribe, and no state or federal law applies.

My payments are all linked to my bank account and set to come out every 2 weeks via automatic ACH transaction, and, since I can't stop the transactions, I continue to get hammered in overdraft fees as well.

The interest rates on these are all ridiculously high (~600% APY). For my $600 Green Trust Cash loan, I will have to repay well over $2000 if I take the full term.

I need advice on what to do and how to handle this. I have no money right now (checking account overdrawn by $300 and I'm 2 weeks behind on one of the payments).

None of the lenders are licensed in the State of Oregon. Were I just to get a new checking account and stop paying, what would happen? Would they try to have me arrested? The agreements say that the only court with authority over the loans is the tribal courts. It wouldn't appear on my credit, since they don't report to credit agencies. Is the worst case scenario that they continue to badger me, or could they then sell the debt to a collections agency which would have more power, or what? And how does being sued by an Indian nation work?

Obviously those are all things I hope to avoid. How should I go about handling this? I cannot afford to keep doing this. I have been in contact with them a bit, but I just got a notice saying Spotloan is currently charging me daily interest plus a $10 fee.

Also, two of the companies had me list references, as well as all 3 of them having my work number. I'm afraid they may start badgering me at work or badgering my loved ones (I think I listed my dad and my girlfriend).

I saw something about someone from Washington sending a letter saying that the loan was illegal, and due to certain state stipulations were not obligated to repay it.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Edit: To those of you whose advice boils down to ""get a job"" or ""do sideline work"", make no mistake, I am definitely making efforts to do so, and have been doing some stuff on the side. That's not really the point of what I am asking about here, however. 

I'm really asking more about how to handle this debt, and navigate interactions with these companies, and how it works with them being tribal loans (or if I am even legally required to pay them back, since they aren't licensed in my state.) 

Also, unless they turn it over to a collections agency, I'd like to know if it would somehow affect my credit report, since the 3 companies do not report to credit agencies.",finance,1482417542

personalfinance,Target charged me a $3.18 without explanation. Check your CC statements.,"I was checking my credit card statement this morning and I saw a charge I made at Target.com for a Christmas present but right next to it was another charge from Target for $3.18.  I called their customer service number to ask what the charge was.  I gave them my previous order number and they said the total cost of the order was the exact difference from what I received in my email.  So I have an email saying the price was $122.16 but then they just decided ""nope, changed our minds.  Price will now be $125.34."" and made a separate charge to make up the difference without any notification.  They said as a ""one time courtesy"" that they would refund me the difference but could not explain to me where it came from (shipping?  tax?).  Just a warning for those of you out there because I wonder how many of these small charges fall through the cracks.

EDIT: Some extra details.  Target confirmed that they made the charge (though the call center rep couldn't tell me why) so it's not a spoofed charge to check if my cc is valid.  My confirmation email from them includes tax and notes that shipping is free.  So it's not an adjustment for sales tax.  If they did need to charge me for shipping after all, they should at least send me an email asking if that's okay or if I want to cancel the order.

personalfinance,Car Payments Are Destroying Me,"Hey everyone, I've tried thinking of everything by myself and doing some research, now I'm just hoping for some advice.

Back in October I was in a car accident. I only had liability, the driver was at fault, but his insurance only wanted to cover 50% of damages. We are now taking them to small claims court at the beginning of 2017. Lawyer says she's 99% sure they'll have to accept 100% liability with the proof given it was the other driver's fault. 

I needed a car to drive to work and other things that I do. Public transportation to work would have been really difficult, Uber/LYft to work just wasn't worth it. 

I'm 25 and just started my credit, never really thought about it before, that's why I'm so late to the game. 

So I got a terrible car loan because I had no other options. The car was $12,000, with tax about $15,000 with a 19% interest rate (I know...). I put a $1300 down payment. My monthly car payment is $360, that's fine, I could handle that because I planned to pay the car off within a year.

Now to the next part. I've always been on my father's insurance with liability, it was so cheap he didn't even make me pay for it. With this loan I needed to get my own full-coverage insurance. 

I have an accident under my belt, side-swiped a parked car reaching for something, damages were around $1200 from what I've been told. And I also have an illegal U-Turn. Those are both within the last two years, never had any problems driving before that, other than a speeding ticket like 5 years ago. 

I've called around to plenty of auto insurance companies, the cheapest I've found for my car was $390/month, I took the offer because no other place quoted me cheaper.

So now I'm paying $750 to drive this car. I just got a new job so I moved back home to save up some cash, I don't have to pay rent currently) until I move back out, but now this car just destroyed my plans.  

Being new to the loan world, I'm wondering how this all works. 

Not counting my chickens before they hatch, but I should be getting around $6,000 for my car and all of the expenses from the accident. 

I'm planning to put that all towards this car. So if this how a car loan works? $6000 + $1300 = $7,300. Then deduct that from my loan of $15,000, I'll only owe $7,700? 

If I'm able to get that $7,700 in 4-5 months, can I fully pay off my car loan? Or will interest factor in somehow?

Any other advice to lower these payments would be great.

So I've never had a credit card before, and I think it's time. I'm 25 and I just began a stable salary job at 48k/yr USD. I have great credit, so am probably eligible for most cards. Travel is my thing, so I figured I'd see if you guys have any recommendations for the best cards with travel rewards. I don't really stay in hotels, so flights are my biggest expense. I'll be paying the balance off every month, so interest rate doesn't really matter to me.

Not sure if relevant, but I probably go on about one long weekend domestic trip a month, and one or two longer international trips per year. I make 48k/yr, USD. And I'm American.

personalfinance,Friend has Credit Card and Medical Debt. Need opinions on options we have come up with to work towards $0 debt.,"I have read through most of the wiki and other articles so I hope I didn't miss this if it is covered somewhere already. I am trying to help out a friend that has found themselves in financial troubles and some debt. They came to me asking for some advice and I have been trying to help them out. We have been debating different options and are looking for some outside input and opinions on the best course of action.

Background
----------
**tl;dr Credit Card Debt $10k. Interest rate 26%. Medical Debt gone to collections. Debt Collector submitted Warrant of Debt Summons to court for $900 debt, 6% interest and $300 admin/lawyers fees.**
 
This is happening in Virginia. Their job didn't provide enough stable income to support themselves. Over time their credit card debt ran up. For even numbers let say $10k. The interest rate on the card is 26%. I know its high but that can be addressed later. Recently the person also received a Warrant of Debt Summons. This is for medical debt. They overlooked the initial contact letter from the debt collector. That original contact letter is the only contact I am aware of prior to receiving the Warrant of Debt Summons. They were making payments on the debt to the physician's office, but apparently there was some issue and the payment plan they thought they setup with the physician's office was not actually in place. The payments they were making were lower than what the physician's office expected as a minimum and it seems they sold the debt to a debt collector. The debt collector is the one that submitted the Warrant of Debt Summons for the remaining balance of $900 plus 6% interest and $300 admin/lawyers fees.

I have already helped them to create a monthly budget and other things to track their finances and spending. My friend is also picking up more hours at their part-time job and they are also looking for a more stable and higher paying full-time job. In the mean time these are the options we have been discussing:

**Debt Repayment**

1. Use Snowball Method to tackle credit cards &amp; save to payoff the medical debt.
2. Consolidate debt into lower interest rate personal loan to payoff credit cards and medical debt.

**The Warrant in Debt Summons**

1. Contact Debt Collector and pay debt with interest and fees prior to summoned court date. Go to the court date if they cannot drop it and plead not guilty since the debt is paid in full.
2. Do NOT contact Debt Collector prior to summoned court date. Go to the court date and plead not guilty and force them to prove they own the debt and possible negotiate with them.
3. Hire lawyer to deal with the Warrant in Debt and determine best course of action. This may be financially improbable though.


The biggest questions and concerns are around the Warrant of Debt in collections and the fear of not handling it correctly resulting in a wage garnishment. Currently the person is leaning towards using the Snowball method to pay the credit card debt and saving to payoff the medical debt prior to the court date in order to go and plead not guilty since it will be paid in full. Any opinions or other suggestions will be helpful. Thanks in advance!",finance,1482429337

personalfinance,Is time considered an expense when self-employed?,"Forgive me if I say anything that's ignorant; I'm not a finance guru.

As a hobby I've been making hairclips with hemp, beads, &amp; feathers. I've received a lot of compliments and multiple people have asked if I wanted to open an Etsy store. The more I've been thinking about it, the more I want to, but I have some questions in regards to taxes:

I asked my dad (who's great with money, but isn't so great at checking his facts) about paying taxes on sales if I were to sell hairclips. He said that I ""don't have to report income until I earn over $600 in profit"", and that ""expenses are not considered profit"", which made sense to me...

Each clip costs roughly $5 in supplies to make. So, for each I sell, I deduct $5 from the price?

Here's where I started feeling confused - time. 

Each clip takes a little less than 2 hours to make (they're quite nice), and this isn't including design or prep-work (such as trimming feathers or picking beads). Let's say I used the Federal Minimum wage of $7.50- that means I'm ""paying myself"" $15 per clip. 

If I were to hire someone to make these, and paid them for their time, I'd obviously consider time/labor an expense. But I'm unsure when you are hiring yourself. 

So if I sold these for $20, would I have to pay taxes at all, since I'm technically not making a profit? 

I have a couple more side questions:

To start this hobby (this year) I spent about $300 up front. Make believe I sold these for $22, would I add up the $2 profit until I reached $300 as expenses? Or do I simply pretend the $300 was never spent because I have no way to prove the money was spent (I, stupidly, did not keep the receipts). 

For each hairclip, should I create a breakdown of how I came up with the $5 supplies expense incase I'm audited? 

And for hours, if they do count as an expense, do I need to record time spent each week? This will be painfully difficult to keep track of, because I make the clips in batches (all beads done on 10, all hemp done on 10, all completed at once).

If I were to cover shipping costs, could I consider shipping an expense?

personalfinance,(US) Which loan to pay on with distribution check,"Hi all,

I'm an absolute moron with money, but I'm trying to be smarter (and to get better at paying off debts).

Background: 

I am a quarter partner in a fast food restaurant. The note for that is $477,928.37 (property and business added together). We've been in business a year, and we're about to have our first distribution, which ends up being about $30k to each partner. 

We don't have bank loans -- instead, one of our partners is serving as our bank and has given us all our loans at 2.5% interest. 

At the same time, I'm closing on a house in the next month that will have a mortgage of ~$250k. Because I am a complete moron with money, I won't have enough for a 5% down payment, and will be doing an FHA loan, which will carry PMI. The interest rate on that loan, while not in writing yet because the offer was just accepted, will be about 4%.

So, the question is, which is the smarter way to use the $30,000 distribution check?

Really, the questions break down to this:

* 1.) Should I use part of the check to pay the down payment on the house up to 5%?

* 2.) Should I use all of the check to pay the down payment, because if things go belly up, I'd rather have more equity in my house.

* 3.) Should I use all of the check to pay for the business? And if so, should I structure it half towards the business, half towards the property? Or split it in accordance to the % that the distribution came from each (60% from the property, 40% from the business).

Or, should I structure a payment some sort of other way?

I'd appreciate any help you're willing to give. Thanks!",finance,1482435314
personalfinance,Atlantic Credit and Finance Collector Harassment! Advice welcomed!,"Hoping to get some advice on a situation. About 15 months ago I took out a $3,000 loan from One Main Financial. Due to unforeseen circumstances with Cancer and my job letting me go due to time missed I was never able to finish paying this loan off. I am finally back to work and caught up and I received a phone call from Atlantic Credit and Finance. This is where the trouble starts...

Firstly they did not ask me to verify my identity in ANY way. Just asked if this was ____ my first name. The first gentleman I spoke to was decently polite but was VERY insistent on me paying something during that phone call. I did not provide any information and as per my knowledge in the FDCPA I asked to have a certified letter sent to me with proof of the debt, and that they were the owners of said debt. Then suddenly the line went quiet, and another guy rudely starts to berate me and say things including ""You could have your wages garnished"" and ""Well this needs to be taken care of today or things could get worse"". I repeated myself maybe 8 times and he keeps insisting they can just ""email"" me proof and THEN starts to recite things like my banking account number and social security number OVER the phone to me. Without my permission and without even knowing if who he is speaking to is even me! I stay firm and he continues to harass and insinuate that this could become ""worse"" for me. Finally after, I asked for a supervisor who then repeats the same things and says they will send the information as requested. Apparently today, they contact me again and say this information is on its way via fedex. NOT a certified letter as requested. 

So I guess my question is whats the best course of action from here. I am highly considering contacting an FDCPA attorney because I'm pretty sure at least a few violations here happened. They also continue to call me with an Unknown number which I am also sure that is a violation as well isn't it?

Sad part is I was more than wiling to pay my debt, but somehow turned into threats and rude behavior on their end. Any input or advice is very welcomed!

personalfinance,Considering looking at foreclosures. Could it be worth my while?,"Hey /r/pf -

So I'm looking to get some insight on an idea I have of looking at foreclosures for my first home purchase. I'm looking in the Howard County, MD area and have not been thrilled with the options that are within my budget so far.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's my situation:

* I've got $90,000 liquid of my own cash that I can spend on a down payment and closing costs for a home. (And this would still leave me with a 9 month emergency fund).

* My parents have very graciously offered me a ""zero interest"" loan of $100,000 to put towards a home. I would be paying them back over 15 years (so monthly payments to them of $555). This would be a strict payment schedule, and I'd be paying it back every month.

* I've separately determined that I would want to keep my total monthly home payment at $2,300 or less. This allows me to continue my goals of maxing my 401k and Roth IRA yearly contributions, while leaving enough to spare for my monthly spending.

* So in my case, I would need the monthly PITI to be $1745 or less. (Because $1745 PITI + $555 parent payback = $2300 total monthly)

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 1:** The first option I've been looking at is simply looking at move-in ready homes that are $425k or less. I would take my parents loan, bundle it with mine, and put what I calculate to be 40.7% down. This would then create a resulting monthly PITI of $1746.49 (using Howard County, MD property taxes and home insurance rates). That, plus my $555 parental payback takes me right to $2,300 a month.

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 2:** Or I'm thinking I could try to find a foreclosure, add on expected repair costs, and put the combined $190,000 towards all of that. Having no clue of actual numbers, here is a made up scenario:

If I found a $286k house, put 27.4% down, there goes my $90k after closing costs. Then I would put my parents $100k towards renovations. The part I know little about is what a conservative expected final appraisal value would be. If it was 10% more than the purchase price + renovation cost, that would make it a $425k home (same as the above example).

But now due to lower mortgage/interest payments (combined with taxes and home insurance off the appraisal rate), I would expect a monthly PITI of $1,520. Add on the $555 payback, and I've got a total monthly of $2,075. That would basically save me $225 a month when compared with option 1. However, I'm not sure if 10% more than total money put in is an accurate expectation. Should one expect more than that? Less than that?

&amp;nbsp;

As for further details of my situation:

* I'm obviously working full time, but would have nights/weekends available to work on renovating a house / overseeing a renovation.

* While I wouldn't want to fully do renovations myself (I'm not quite that handy), I would want to try and find a balance of doing what I could in my spare time, and letting a contractor do the rest that was beyond my ability.

* My uncle is a retired contractor, and is willing to go around with me to see foreclosures, and give me a head's up of how much renovation work I should expect / help point out big issues in homes. However, he would not be available to do the actual contracting work, so I'd need to find one on my own for that.

* I'm currently renting in the area, and am on a month to month lease. My only goal is to be in a home in one year's time, so I don't mind waiting a little bit by going the foreclosure route. But I would not want the buying process + renovation process to take more than one year. Outside of the rising interest rates, I have no external pressures of **needing** to move into a move-in ready home any time in the next 12 months.

personalfinance,Help me get my finances together,"Hello. I don't know if a post like this is allowed. I read through the rules and didn't find anything. I've also read the material written and would like to hear from others in getting my finances together

I make 70k/year. My company does 401k match 100% up to 3% of my salary. I get a bonus of 3% per year as well

My current expenses. 
- $1000/month for rent
- $1000/month for the next 9 months (friend gave me a loan for my car)
- $500 for the next 12 months for a private non interest school loan 
- About $400 a month in expenses which include phone, gym membership, gas and car insurance (this is a ballpark figure but I'm not off by much)
- About 20k in federal student loan at some interest rate(currently pay about $250 towards it per month)

Income:
- only source of income is my job which is about $4000 after taxes

personalfinance,Options in Years ahead of Medical School,"Greetings,

I am 23 y/o, employed in a position that expects me for another 1.5 years before I will hopefully enter med school. I currently have no debt and 10k saved. I anticipate that over the next 1.5 years I will save a further 17k. I expect that 3k of this savings will be needed for flights to and from interviews and for application fees. I have read the material in the sidebar for ages 18-25. I am reaching out to ask whether it is sensible to invest some of this savings. I was prompted to reach out by seeing the option for an 11 month 1.25% APR CD through Ally in which I could park all of my current savings. 

The government did away with subsidized Stafford loans for medical students in 2011 so I would expect to carry most medical school debt in the form of unsubsidized Stafford loans which are currently at an interest rate of ~5.8%. I do not know whether we are in an investing climate that a managed fund would outpace 5.8% in which case I would want all my savings available in 2 years as I enter medical school to go immediately against the loan.

Is investing 10K over the next 1.5-2 years worthwhile? Is a short-term CD such as the one above my best bet?

I should note that my current employer does not match retirement contributions at all which makes this option less attractive to me.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks in advance for advice. Please ask any questions that would help you advise me better.",finance,1482441927

I've got money in a checking account now. No interest, but no fees either. I'm not paying fees for someone to hold my money. I had a savings account as a kid but that was a nuisance at some point so I got rid of it. It did actually earn interest though.
So today saw some posts about 1% in a savings account, better than nothing, etc. I figured I'd check into setting up a savings accounts. Yes, 1% is better than nothing. Still not inflation though, but something. And surprise... 1% would be extravagant now. Savings accounts, CDs.... It's pathetic. Part of me is thinking I'd spend the time better recycling aluminum cans than meeting with a banker or setting anything up. Invest a $1,000 for a year, get $1 back. A whole dollar.....
And there's inflation.... And then cost of living increases.... I understand my money loses value.
If I still want the money available (which could be x amount immediately, y amount in a couple months [thinking CD there, but even CD interest rates were crap], etc.), what are my options? What are other people doing with money to have it available and lose as little value as possible? Stick some in a savings account with .01 interest? (It's not that at my bank, but it's not that far off either.... And .01 or .02 isn't that much of a difference with the pennies of interest generated). Stick some in a savings account and... invest some? Assume risk there in order to stave off inflation and cost of living a bit? That would have risk and then the extra cost and hassle of transferring it out of an investment back into cash/liquid money.

personalfinance,Wondering if its worth putting more money down to avoid PMI and / or purchasing points for my mortgage,"Hello, thank you for reading and offering any advice, as I am a first time home buyer and am both excited and nervous about the biggest purchase of my life.  I apologize if its a lot of text!

**My PMI Situation**
In October, I was pre-approved for a 30 year mortgage of $297,500 based on a price of $350,000 with a 15% down payment and a 3.750% interest rate (wish i locked it in back then!).  If i was to purchase a home with the maximum amount they approved me for, they estimated my PMI would cost me $54.54 per month ($654.48 per year).

Now, the seller has accepted my offer of $338,000.  My initial plan was to still only put 15% down ($50,700) and finance the rest ($287,300).  Since I'm purchasing a home below the maximum they allowed me, is it safe to assume my PMI will be less than the $54.54 per month quoted originally?  To make up the extra 5% needed to completely eliminate PMI, I would need to pay an extra $16,900 out of pocket, which dips far into my reserve fund.  Looking at an Amortization Schedule, I estimate that I would reach 20% equity at roughly the 40 month mark by just making my minimum payments.  Using the estimated PMI mentioned above, that would add up to roughly $2,181 in PMI costs over that 40 month period.  Personally, I think the extra cash in my pocket right now is worth more to me than an extra $54.54 a month.  Are my assumptions true? Can someone give me their thoughts and or correct my math if i made a mistake somewhere?

**Purchasing Points On Interest Rate**
As mentioned above, the original rate of 3.75% I was quoted is no longer available.

My credit union is telling me that the current 30 year fixed rate with 0 points is 4.250%.  I have the option of purchasing 1 point for 4.125% and 2 points for a rate of 4.000%. Each point would cost me a total of $2,873 out of pocket which is much more manageable than the extra 5% down I was talking about above.  Now, maybe my math is wrong, but it seems to me that in my situation, purchasing these points will not pay off for over 10 years, as my principle and interest payment looks like the following for those three options:

* 4.250% w/ 0 Points = ~$1,413
* 4.125% w/ 1 Point = ~$1,392
* 4.000% w/ 2 Points = ~$1,371

If i divide the difference of the 0 &amp; 2 point options ($42) by the cost paid for the points ($5,746) i'm realizing it will take over 11 years to break even.  Does my math seem to be correct? And if so, which option would you choose?

It's like clockwork, there are people making millions of dollars as you read this, and most of them are in China. If you're thinking , hey i could have made money if i bought it 4 months ago, then the reality is, not really. The profits you will realize over 6 months, will be dwarfed by what you could have realized using that fiat in other ventures, again, addressing the real hustlers out there who put in mad work, if you're a savings kinda person, then you will benefit in the long run, in spite of what happens right now.

The minimal amount to get into profit making over the time period of 6 to 12 months vis a vis using cash flow to channel into better deals is now out of reach of most people. EMPHASIS : The Minimal Amount. A person investing $100 will not see better returns over 12 months than using that money to make moves on other investments, but once you hit higher numbers, yes, it is a great investment.

Sad, but true, unless we have a couple thousand hidden techies here who're willing to exchange whatever money they have left over after living expenses for BTC, and if that money is considerable. In short, gamblers, which most rational BTC enthusiasts are not.

If it ever does become a currency, it will be like tiny miniscule amounts of gold dust being exchanged for goods.

What is the reason for the upswing? You could say chinese market fears, Trump presidency yada yada yada... but if we cut the bullshit it is simply; People are pumping the bubble to make money, once they decide to pop it like a zit, BTC rep will take a hit..again.

That's it, enjoy while it lasts. Ideally now would be the time to buy stuff with Bitcoin that will hold value so that when it crashes (not a fault with BTC but due to the market inflating actors) you will come out a winner.

Again, BTC has real value that will not go away but the market inflation and deflation from people looking to make a quick buck makes it's rise and falls look precarious to the people who would adopt it more widely.

personalfinance,Aiming to be debt free in 4 years. Have I covered my bases well enough with this budget?,"I recently revamped our budget to see how quickly we could become debt free based on certain lifestyle changes. I enjoy reading about personal finance/frugality, and feel I've got a budget that supports our plan, though it still contradicts in areas with what a lot of people recommend. I'm interested in other's thoughts on what (if any) changes would really be worthwhile to what I've listed below.

Background: Married 5 years (24, wife 26) with 3 children living in the Midwest. Wife works management in food industry, I'm an engineer in the HVAC industry. Combined we make just over 110k/year, taking home 84k not including bonuses, which we don't factor in our budget anyway. We'd like to become debt free as quickly as possible without removing all enjoyment from our lives over the next 4 years. We've financed cars 1 &amp; 2 below within the past two years (both previously drove paid off late 90s/early 00s vehicles that broke down). We both have a 30 minute commute to work, and put about 20,000 miles/year on our vehicles.

Expenses on $7,000/month take home pay:

* Childcare: $1,000
* Mortgage: $827 (3 years into 30 year, 84k left on loan, 4.25%)
* Vanguard: $450 (we max my Roth IRA in addition to my employer match on my 401k)
* Car 1: $421 ('14 Mazda 6. 21k left on loan, 3.74%)
* Utilities: $400 (natural gas, electric, water, internet)
* Student Loans: $376 (7 loans totaling 29k, ranging from 3.86% to 5.00%)
* Groceries: $300
* Car 2: $291 ('08 GMC Acadia, 9k left on loan, 2.99%)
* Phones: $220
* Auto Insurance: $164
* Baby/Toddler Needs: $150
* Eating out: $150
* Gas: $135
* Entertainment/Subscriptions: $100 (movies, books, games, prime, netflix, Costco, YNAB, etc.)
* Toiletries: $60
* Tags/Taxes: $50 (amortized)
* Clothes: $30
* Gifts: $25
* Auto/Home Maintenance: $15 (oil changes, light house work)

We've brought our budget to a point where we have just over $1,800 available each month to pay towards extra principal, but wouldn't mind hearing a second opinion. The biggest takeaway I see most people discussing is how horrible a car payment is to have, and yet we've got two. While the extra cash would be nice to snowball onto our loans even more, I'm not sure if selling them would be worthwhile at this point or not, as we'll currently pay $2,000 in interest on them while paying them off over 4 years (only down about $400 from full term considering the lower rates on these vs. mortgage/student loans), and I'm not sure what value we'd get out of them. The house is another deal I've read people mention. Our job locations switched after buying our house to the new commute, so I've found it hard to justify selling with so little equity. I understand the extra time, wear, and tear on our vehicles, but still am not sure if it's justifiable. Finally, I know some of the smaller monthly expenses are leisurely, but am trying to find a middle ground.

We'd like to move in about 6-7 years closer to work (and to have a nicer home), so the current plan would be to own our house and be debt free from everything after 4 years, allowing another 2-3 years to save (larger down payment or wife's retirement accounts), so I'm curious as to what others see as worth it to cut (if anything). We plan to snowball our debt based off the highest interest rate.

Thanks for reading.

personalfinance,Are any of these financial tips from my 2009 business college still relevant?,"I took a personal financial management class at my public university almost a decade ago.  These were some tips which stood out to me and I'm curious if these are still relevant or if they're now incorrect due to new regulations.  These may be specific for America.  

The class covered the following areas: financial statements, expenditure and credit/debt management, time value of money, insurance (disability, health, liability, long-term care), investing and portfolio allocation, tax reduction, retirement plans and estate planning.

I don’t remember everything, but the biggest tips and insights are tattooed into my brain. 

Biggest Insight = The most significant factor affecting the health of your retirement plan/investments is…’which basket do you fill first’? After you pay all your fixed living costs, where do you put your money first, in what magnitude? This has a greater impact on your retirement/investments than “timing the market (when to invest or cash out)”, or “picking the correct stocks/bonds”.

Example: You get paid. You pay your rent/MTG, taxes, (pension if required), health insurance, car pmt/INS, utilities, and minimum loan payments. You set aside a sensible amount for food/entertainment.

The remaining cash is disposable income. Now the pertinent decision arises. What basket do you fill first? How much do you put in?

If Loan Interest Rates &gt; Deposit Account Interest Rates then Paying down your debt is your 1st bucket.

If you cannot make a higher rate of return, guaranteed, than the rate your lenders are making off you, you eliminate this negative rate of return as soon as possible. This minimizes your debt cost while also reducing your debt load, which improves your credit score computation.

If you’re one of the lucky few who can get a 100% matched 401K fund through your employer, then this 401K is your 1st bucket. You contribute the Maximum amount allowed. This is a 100% rate of return [assuming you stipulate it is invested sensibly (very diversified across industries/nations/continents, with a significant % into precious metals) and you avoid all penalties when cashing out].

Your next bucket is to contribute towards a financial instrument that behaves like a Roth IRA. The money gets taxed going in, but it builds and builds until retirement age, and then you cash it out without incurring any additional taxes or penalties. There is a maximum that you can contribute, but I believe you can open 2 or 3 of these. This isn’t a problem unless you’re freaking loaded, as most of us won’t be able to throw $300,000.00 into three different IRAs each year (about $100K per IRA).

Only now, with whatever disposable cash is remaining, do you contribute towards a purely speculative stock/bond trading strategy (timing the market and trying to pick the “Winners” all on your own). This is very risky, so you fill this basket last. This is you playing blackjack at the financial market casino.

    The difference between this last bucket and the 401K and Roth IRA is that, when you open the 401K and Roth IRA you get to choose a very diversified portfolio. This limits your risk if one industry, or nation, or continent tanks. 401Ks and IRAs are managed by, cough, professionals. The last bucket is just you researching on your own and trying to guess which stocks/bonds are good, and when to put in and when to cash out. You could diversify here as well, but that’s essentially what you did with your 1 to 3 IRAs (or their equivalent).

Tip #1: Pay your kids. A very cool tip the Professor shared is how he and some of his rich friends pay their children for doing household chores, starting from the youngest age legally possible. Why? This is the best way to pass wealth/inheritance to your children.

Your children are in the lowest possible tax bracket. So as soon as they are old enough, you start paying them for sweeping the floor, or mowing the lawn, etc. But you don’t hand them cash. You pay into a financial instrument on their behalf where the money is taxed going in (Lowest taxes possible), but then is allowed to grow and build until they cash it out. You need to keep paperwork for the payments listing what they did.

I think the fund can be cashed when they need the money for college, or you can get them started on their retirement IRA super early. Either way, it’s a better way to bequeath wealth to your children than dying and having them pay the Estate Inheritance Tax. There is a maximum amount you can contribute, but you max that out. If you have children this becomes the Bucket that follows you paying into your own retirement IRAs, and before you speculatively play the stock market. This falls under ‘Estate Planning’, i.e. how your children inherit your assets and money with the smallest taxes and penalties.

Tip #2: Protect yourself with a supplemental Umbrella insurance policy. Get an extra insurance policy that blanket covers you for a huge amount, say $2 million, for any and all unexpected circumstances. The idea is, why spend time, effort, and money to execute the best retirement/investment strategy if some accident will get you sued for all of your money? I’d hate to be 2 months from retirement only to have a car accident and get sued for all of my retirement accounts.

Also on insurance…consider an insurance policy that covers you for lifetime disability, including fulltime medical care. If you have a catastrophic accident, that would pay for a nurse 24/7 to do everything. God I sound like an insurance salesmen, but this is what the class advised us to consider.

Tip #3: Understand the tax rules. Rich people can afford to pay tax experts to figure it out for them. But us little guys can at least avoid the biggest and most obvious tax pitfalls. Avoid penalties, avoid double or triple taxation. Proactive Tax Reduction!

Tip #4: Stipulate your children as the beneficiaries of all of your financial accounts and assets. The absolute worst thing you can do is allow your money or properties to fall into ‘Probate’ after you die. This is a huge pain in the ass for your kids to deal with. Easily solved by listing them as your beneficiaries.

Tip #5: Understand how your credit score is computed. A mortgage and student loans are considered “White Collar” debt, and does not significantly affect your credit score calculation. The big factor is your “Consumer” debt ratio. How much consumer debt is available to you, and how much of that max are you using? If you have an old credit card that you never use anymore, do not cancel it. Just keep it and don’t use it, or hardly use it. This increases the amount of consumer debt you can access, and by hardly using it, this helps your credit score.

My manager at my old job in the USA said her husband had a card from his early college days that he never uses. It now had like, a $50,000 credit limit. He was about to cancel it because he thought it was bad to keep it open and not use it. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Tip #6: Die with a massive amount of debt. As long as your kids will not need to repay your financial obligations, the best thing you can do is to die at a ripe old age with a massive amount of credit card and loan debt. You never pay it back, and neither will your kids. ;)

Tip #7: I can’t remember this one entirely so I probably shouldn’t even include it. But maybe someone else knows what I’m talking about.

Keep buying a bigger and nicer vacation/2nd Home every few years. This might only work in America, because it is very specific. You have your primary residence, but then if you’re rich enough to buy a 2nd Home, you keep upgrading it. Each time you upgrade to a more expensive place, you keep pushing off the taxes. You continuously postpone the tax obligation. The idea is to push off the taxes until you die. You never pay the taxes, and your children don’t either. But they can take ownership of the home. Really foggy on this one, you should probably ignore this last one.

Google search for Retirement Planning Excel Spreadsheets. Wouldn’t hurt to download one and plug in some numbers. You choose your desired target for Age of retirement, and how much money (adjusted for expected inflation) you need each year until you die. Plug in your tax rate, rates of your debt and investments, and it tells you everything. A very good tool to plan your retirement. Much better than going willy nilly. The ‘Quicken’ computer program was used for the course. I’d recommend using it.",finance,1482494924
personalfinance,Wife and I paid off student loans. Best next step?,"My wife and I are 27/28 years old. I make 64k and she makes 45k. Just paid off student loans this morning. No kids, but starting to try. No retirement savings yet because focus was on student loans (4.5+%) and some HELOC balance from home improvement. Neither of our work really has an IRA match. 

For assets we have home equity and some cash. Bought 3 years ago. Was 4.625% 30-year and refinanced last week to 15-year at 2.875%. Loan is $90,000 and monthly payment about $900. Appraised at $135,000 which I think is safe.

I have $4,000 in my checking, and we have $6,000 in our shared vacation/emergency fund. $10,000 HELOC with no balance for additional emergency fund. Neither of us has credit card or car debt but I would like a truck in the next couple years but not necessity. 

Do you think our savings are adequate, especially when trying to have a kid? Should we just start dumping our money into an IRA (*meant to say 401k) and reassess budget when we have a kid? I'm thinking we'll have about a spare $3,500 per month. Should I put extra on the house payment or not bother with the low-interest rate?

personalfinance,Holiday bonus deductions,"So today is the last payday of the year (huzzah) and my employer decided to give out a small holiday bonus to everyone. A nice gesture. The problem is, the bonus was delivered as a second check on the same pay period. This caused the check to be subject to the normal bi-weekly deductions (dental/medical/401k) that you would get hit with for a normal paycheck. Plus the usual percentage of your SS/medicare/fedTax. An already modest $200 turned into $84 take home, with the ""extra"" deductions doing over half the damage.

personalfinance,"Self employed, trying to figure out if it makes sense tax-wise to create an LLC","Hello /r/pf!

I'm 23, I started my business when I was 14 and have been growing it since then. I'm a working musician; primarily teaching, but I also have a regular singing gig and a handful of one-off commissions each year.

Nearly all of income comes as cash and personal checks/transfers. I record all of it and pay it on a Schedule-C form. This year I also started a W9 contracting job (the singing gig). I haven't paid W9 taxes before but as I understand it, it's functionally the same as the rest of my income I just have to put it on a different line.

I do a lot of driving for my job. I need to start keeping actual records (mea culpa) but I estimated that I drove 7,800 work miles in 2015, to make $24,000 gross. I expect that ratio to be a bit worse for 2016 because the singing gig pays less per hour and is more driving than teaching. In 2016 I made $34,500 and I'm confident that I will make more than $45,000 in 2017, just to give an idea of where my income is headed.

I live in Michigan, which means that I pay state income tax as well as federal. I'm getting married and moving out of my parents' and finishing college all in 2017 which will change my tax, insurance, and living status obviously. My fiancée is also a self-employed working musician.

-------

I hope that's enough relevant information for my question: honestly, I haven't put a lot of thought into an LLC (or any other formal business structure) before. I'm not sure what exactly it would help with or if it would just complicate my taxes too much to be worth it (I file by myself with FreeTaxUSA currently).

I bring it up though for a few reasons:

1. I was told that I can save on the self-employment tax by creating the LLC and ""paying myself"" a smaller salary. I'd pay the relevant taxes on that but whatever's left would ONLY be subject to an income tax, not social security and whatnot. I'd love to know more about this, if it's viable, etc.

2. Would it make sense for my future wife and I to both be employees of one entity, rather than filing completely separately? I mean as far as personal income tax is concerned we'll be filing jointly (unequal income levels) but is there any benefit to putting all of our income under one company umbrella?

3. Are there any other costs or benefits to making this change, as opposed to my current setup? Particularly concerning work miles driven, health insurance, and retirement options?

I'd love to hear more, especially from people who have dealt with this themselves and decided one way or another.

Thanks!

From what I understood, a Roth had taxes taken out now, and a Traditional had them taken out when I retire. I am currently putting 4% into a Roth, nothing else. 

Now here is where I am confused. On my pay stub, my before tax pay is $2,384.60 ($29.81/hr at 80 hrs, I am salaried). Now, from what I understood, the way my contributions would be calculated is first taking out all my tax amounts (state, federal, medicare, etc.) then from that amount, my Roth contribution is determined.

What I'm contributing to my Roth according to my pay stub is $95.38. Which is 4% of my pre-taxed dollars ($2,384.60). From what I understood, that's how a Traditional 401k would work. My total contribution amount to my Roth according to my pay stub is $1,049.18, which matches my contribution amount on my Schwab account.

Take for example the following criteria:

Also, what is ""Representative APR?""

   Initially my plan was to get a 2nd job to supplement because Americorps pays practically slave wages, but now I'm thinking I should probably just get a higher paying full time job. I was informed of this last night after I had bought xmas presents and after it all I have about $700 in the bank.

--New job I think I can get pays $15/hour for 35 hours a week working as an education assistant, so after taxes I think should be about $1600-1700 a month. 

--Assuming my good buddy agrees to be my roommate, the apartment I am looking at would be about $450/month. 

--Car insurance is currently $56/month, healthcare would continue through my parents, although I would probably sign up for MNsure (MN affordable care act). 

--Student loan payment and credit card debt about $250/month.

--Gas and other miscellaneous expenses about $100/month.

financialindependence,Your thoughts on if it's always better to put more in 401k vs extra payments on mortgage?,"My mortgage interest rate is 4.25%, which I know conventional wisdom here seems to be ignoring paying extra on the mortgage until you've at least maxed your 401k due to the higher gains. I completely understand that from a cold hard math perspective.

What about from a human perspective where you factor in risk and emotions? I'll give my situation as an example. I'm 2 years into my mortgage, in my early 30's, and just recently found out about the FIRE movement and it's extremely appealing to me (partly because I hate my job). I live in a LCOL area where the job market isn't fantastic for IT (my field), but it isn't barren either. My wife tends to vary between neutral about her job and enjoying it (nursing). 

The current mortgage plan I came up with before finding out about FIRE is if we pay $500 extra (each) a month on the mortgage, plus $4000k extra once a year then we'll have the house paid off in roughly 8 more years. ($4k extra is from tax returns. we have our tax withholding done as if we're single, but then we file jointly. I know this will probably draw criticism, but it's one of few ways I can get my wife to go along with saving more money :P). Now technically we're capable of paying even more to pay it off sooner, but I'm probably the only one willing out of the 2 of us to go beyond the current plan on a regular basis.

My wife is seemingly indifferent about FIRE at this point in time, so if I want to FIRE then i'm basically planning on it without her help other than splitting bills and such. Anyway, since this post is more about your thoughts rather than the feasibility of the numbers, basically I crunched the numbers and there's no way I can do my current $500 extra on the mortgage per month AND max out my 401k contributions.

**Main part of the question:**
My current thought process is I'd rather pay off the mortgage with my current plan above (or even faster) because that feels less risky to me. If something happened to me or my wife where one of us couldn't work, there wouldn't be much room for enjoying life with the current mortgage payment. Similar thing that if I just get so burnt out on IT that I just have to walk out the door one day to keep my sanity, and have some down time to recoup and figure out what to do career-wise. If that happens during the mortgage, that would cause a lot of marital friction due to dumping all the expenses on my wife and not having much left for vacations and other fun. If I sacrificed getting a lot of the new shiny gadgets for a few years, got house paid off, then walked out of work due to burnout..... I think the marital friction would be much lower due to much lower expenses then. Hopefully everything would remain fine with us both employed, then I'd have tons income freed up to max 401k, probably max a ROTH IRA or something, and maybe invest in some index funds too. 

What does everyone here think? Do you just go mostly by cold hard math, or does anyone share thoughts similar to mine?

personalfinance,Here is my troubling story about recent identity theft. You might have suggestions and you might learn something from it.,"It started with an email I initially thought was a phishing attempt. I put it in the trash, but took another look a few days later, and I realized it was legitimate. My application for an Amazon credit card had been granted, but I had not applied for one. I did some investigation, found out that someone had applied for several credit cards in my name. I was NOT NOTIFIED about these applications, not by mail, email or telephone. And they are all granted!

Then I found out that someone had changed the addresses on my bank accounts, gasoline credit cards, and one major credit card. Interestingly, the new addresses were all the same -- a slummy neighborhood a few miles away from my home. It appears to be an actual residence, looks like the kind of place where meth addicts would live. I don't know the criminal's name -- he is using my name. It seems likely he has a fake ID with my name and his address on it. This is interesting, because it looks like it's a local job, not some cyber-crime ring from Nigeria or Russia.

If you're wondering, I don't actually do many financial transactions over the internet. PayPal, internet banking and Amazon, mostly. I don't have internet access to any of my credit card accounts.

This is all rather disturbing. I've spent a long time on the telephone. If you ask, most banks and credit card companies will give you a ""personal password."" I did that. I locked down my credit reports with all three major credit agencies. I set up two-factor authentication with the small number of internet sites I do business with.

It looks like the perpetrator knows my date of birth and social security number. Can't imagine where he got them. I've not had any computers lost or stolen. My best theories: 1-He, or someone he knows, got into my office, found some documents in an unlocked file cabinet. Maybe a janitor or something. 2-He stole some mail from my mailbox. These are just theories, though.
I don't know if it's possible for a local thug to buy information like this, related to local addresses, on the dark web. Does anybody know?

I'm being more careful with documents in my office, and I got a locking mailbox at home. However, the damage is already done. He knows my date of birth and social security number, probably. Once information like this is ""in the wild"" I can never get it back again.

I had a long talk with my bank. My life savings are in those accounts, all my retirement savings, all my working capital, everything. How was he able to change the addresses on those accounts? I was surprised and disturbed by what I found out. It was apparently done over the telephone, but that isn't clear because banks don't keep detailed records of these transactions.

Over the telephone, banks ask security questions. I think they might be computer-generated, based on information the bank and credit reporting agencies have on file. Apparently, if he had my name, address, social security and date of birth, he had complete access.

Banks and credit companies are pretty lax. If they say, ""What is your mother's maiden name?"" I can reply, ""Gee, I was an orphan, I never knew my mother's maiden name."" The bank might say, ""Oh well, we understand. How about your social security number? Do you have that?"" And so on. They will let you fail a number of security questions before denying access. If the perp happens to know a few answers, he might get access.

I later learned that a suspicious bank representative actually let the perp change my address, but then called me, left me a voicemail message, wanting to confirm that the change was legitimate. They left the voicemail on a Friday afternoon at 4 PM on the beginning of a three-day weekend, on my business voicemail. I didn't get it until Tuesday morning. Needless to say, this was incredibly lame and lax. By then, the perpetrator had changed the billing addresses on other credit cards and accounts, and applied for many other kinds of credit, in my name.

I've talked with the local police. A young and pleasant officer came to my house. He seemed concerned, but he was completely unprepared to cope with the problem, he was poorly trained, just guessed at what had gone wrong, gave me a photocopy of a half-assed pamphlet about identity theft, containing the usual obvious advice. I asked him if the local police department had some kind of specialist to handle crimes like this. He was evasive, but the answer was obviously ""No."" Beyond that, most local police departments, including mine, seem to consider these cases ""low priority."" They don't have the resources or the motivation to pursue them.

Since someone was tampering with my mailing address, I thought it might be a federal crime, so I tried reporting it to the Postal Service authorities. I got as far as the USPS website. I tried reporting it on an incredibly shitty and user-hostile website. The Postal Service responded by holding my mail at the local post office without notifying me! I didn't get any mail for over a week, so I thought someone was stealing my mail every day out of my mail box. This caused new anxiety. I tried to talk it over with the local post master. I normally defend the postal authorities, but this guy clearly did not give one single fuck. He just told me to visit the website and fill out a form. (Of course I had already done that, and that's why my mail was missing in the first place!) That was infuriating. I eventually found out by accident that all my missing mail was being held at the post office.

Today, I got a letter from Cross River Bank, representing Best Egg, which appears to be some kind of a loan company. Somebody, probably the same guy, just applied for a $5,000 home improvement loan, in my name. Fortunately, the application was denied, because I have locked down my credit reports at the big three credit reporting agencies.

I know a private detective who generously offered to look into the matter for me - I didn't hire him. Working from the perpetrator's address -- the address he changed my bank accounts to, he was able to find out the perpetrator's name. He won't tell me the name, but he tells me that local law enforcement ""is aware of the situation."" My guess is that the perpetrator is on probation or parole and the detective was able to have a friendly off-the-record chat with the probation or parole officer. I don't know if this will go anywhere.

The good news is, I haven't lost any money yet, and I guess my position is fairly secure now, though I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.

So, there's my story. If you've been through something similar, you might find some of this information useful. I've learned a few things about this topic, so if you have questions for me, I might be able to answer. If you'd like to comiserate, I'd love to hear from you. If you have good ideas that have not yet occurred to me, I'd like to hear them.

My big-picture comment is that bank and credit security procedures are unbelievably lax. If local thugs have figured out how to commit this kind of fraud, this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. It's possible that no one really knows how to fix it. Two-factor identification seems to be the best idea going around, and that is a step in the right direction, but criminals are going to figure out how to bypass that, too.

My guess is that it is already a huge problem, but the banking and credit industries are trying to keep it quiet.

My only remaining question is whether I should change my Social Security number. There is a mechanism for doing that, but it's not easy and there are some strict guidelines. I'm not sure if I'm eligible and it might be more trouble than it's worth.
Date of Birth is often used as a secure identifier, but I guess there is no way to change my date of birth!

personalfinance,23M Filing for bankruptcy with only $30-$33k debt,"I am a 23yo male who makes roughly $46,000 a year ($31,000 after taxes). I am in Information Technology and am a bit past entry level at this point with no where but up to go, and the sky is the limit. I plan on going up the skill ladder and making $100,000+ a year before I am 30.

I am filing for bankruptcy. You may ask why since I am so young and possibly couldn't of screwed myself over that bad, especially to the point where I would want to file for something *so devastating*! To be brief, I have about $10,000 in credit card debt and about $20,000 in car debt between two cars. 

Now the credit card debt is me being a stupid child with my money, I admit that. ""New card with $3,000 limit, only for emergencies!"" Well I decided to buy a bunch of stuff for my gaming PC since it wasn't the latest and greatest. This ""small"" purchase of $500 for a new graphics card turned into about a $2,000 purchase of other things to get me where I wanted to be for my PC. This particular card has an interest rate 29.9%. The other $7,000 is me trying to credit surf. You know, pay one card with another or move debt around without actually paying it off. Well then I did a balance transfer to get the first card interest rate killed off, and then spent it again effectively raising the amount I owe again. And so the cycle continues. New card for emergencies only, spend to the limit, rinse and repeat. I also keep paying a little bit down and think, ""Well it's already this high, so why not just max it? I'll pay it down and not use it again!"" Yet I do and I've learned my lesson now. At least I think I have. Guess we'll find out ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

The car situation is odd now. I am signed onto my personal car and I am ""co-signed"" on another car. Let's deal with the co-signed one first. When I was 19-20yo, I had a friend who was always down on his luck and just never seemed to catch a break. Me being naive and wanting to help him as much as I could, not knowing what I would be doing to my credit score, went to a used car dealer ship with him and let him pick any car he wanted. He chose a 2006 Mercedes. The car was $13,000 and I don't know the interest rate but if I had to guess it was around 8-10%. The reason co-signed is in quotes in the first line is because they decided to make me the primary and him the secondary. Semantics. He was paying the car on time for about 4 months, then everything suddenly turned on him. His bosses sucked, he lost his jobs, his wife was trying to divorce him, his step daughters father put her medical bills in his name, and the car started falling apart. This guy is always having problems with other people and nothing is ever his fault. I realized what kind of person he was and cut him out. It's been almost 3 years and the car loan is only down to about $6,000 now. Many late payments and missed payments. Killing my credit and chances at getting a new car later. I can't afford to pay the loan and my bills so I've just had to deal with it. I've also asked him multiple times to refinance and get my name off the loan, but he never does and always has an excuse. 

The second car, well I bought it at $16,500 at 8.5% with 50,000 miles on it with a drive train warranty for $2,000 in February 2014. That warranty saved my ass when the transmission started acting up and they replaced it for free. So I say I paid upfront for a new transmission in that $16,500. Though I wish the transmission was the only problem. It has multiple things wrong with it and many of them are much to expensive for me to pay to fix. The car is now worth roughly $7,000-$8,000 and I still owe roughly $13,000-$14,000 on it. After two years the car has about 90,000 miles on it and is mostly mechanically safe but not worth a damn. Upside down with costly repairs. No thanks. 

Now I see why filing for bankruptcy at my age with about $30,000-$33,000 of debt seems like a stupid idea. Trust me I know. Here's my logic. I make roughly $2,600 a month. Now I live in a growing state where housing prices are still rising steadily. I currently only pay about $400 a month in a house due to a very unique living situation, but it's going away in February. My car the one I am solely responsible for costs about $300 a month for the loan and about $200 for the insurance on it. So every month I am losing $500 a month to drive a car that is breaking down more and more every passing day. All of my debt not including student loans is about $500 a month as well. Student debt is about $300 a month. So with my car, credit cards, and student debt, roughly half my post-tax income is going to debt. Now I have consider housing. Where I am a one bedroom goes for about $1,100/month and that would only leave me about $200 a month for food, gas, and other bills. I drive about a 30 mile round trip for work and I can get about 400 miles out of a tank of gas but I have to drive to other places further away for friends and family things. $200 is not enough for all the other bills I have to pay and to survive. I'm not very frugal, but I try, albeit not very hard. 

So I have started the process of filing for bankruptcy. This will effectively give me about $1,000 of my income back. Now I will need a new car and am already saving the amounts I would have to pay to my credit card debt to buy a used car that is any where from $2,000-$5,000 in price. I want to own my car and not get screwed again. Something I can maintain for many more years and really drive into the ground. I made the mistake of wanting to flaunt my success by showing off my money with a nice newish car. I have since learned being able to say I have $5,000 or even $10,000 (personal goal) saved for an emergency is better and more mentally sane than looking good to impress other people. Once the process is complete, I know I will receive offers from credit card companies begging me to sign up and I will refuse to do. I know the rabbit hole and refuse to jump into it again until I know I can control my spending habits.

To me this is a very logical choice. I can kill my credit now and rebuild it again since I am so young and not worry too much. This will lower my stress levels and allow me to enjoy life. I'm sick of working to pay for things I bought with hours I work in the future. I want financial freedom and this is how I see it. Thank you for reading this far and letting me vent out everything. Writing this out has helped me immensely reaffirm that is the best and logical choice.

Minor Edit: As I just thought about, some of you may ask me, ""How did you get the money to file for bankruptcy when you can't even afford to pay your bills?""

I didn't have a job lined up or any savings before so I lived off of it and got a new job in two weeks. Used the remainder to file and keep me going until my first check.",finance,1482570613

So I called the office for an explanation, left a message, and never received a call back. Then, since I was busy in school, forgot about the bill and moved apartments.

I never went back to that office so I never changed my address. They ended up sending me a bill to my permanent address (my parent's house) about a year later. I called them again and the biller told me she was too busy to look into it today because they were short-staffed (and a few other excuses) and that she'd look into it later and call me back. Over a week went by and she never called back. So I called again to ask about the status. This time, it was an assistant who told me the biller was not there and she'd leave her a message to call me back. Later on, I got a voicemail from the biller saying she was going to file an appeal with my insurance company because they denied paying because supposedly the claim was not filed on time. She continued on about how she had proof they filed the claim on time and more excuses...And that she'd continue to work on the appeal and let me know. A few more weeks go by with no response so I call back once again. She quickly says that she's still working on it and now there's some other issues like they can't find my insurance information, or something! But she's still working on it! (So she says). This last phone call was around October 2016.

Sorry for the long post, but my question is who is responsible to pay the bill?

financialindependence,Capital Gains Harvesting,"Merry Christmas! Here's just a PSA as we approach the end of the year that if you fall below the 25% marginal tax bracket, you pay no federal income taxes on long term capital gains in your non-advantaged account. For instance, let's say that you just got out of school and only worked for half the year. Whatever the reason, you may want to consider selling some of your investments to realize their gains. Then you can buy them right back. By doing this, you essentially raise your cost basis for free, which can benefit you in future years when you'll be redeeming your investments. Just be careful that you don't sell so much that you bump yourself into the next bracket.

Edit: As u/ialwayswinbingo reminded us, that this is federal only, and your mileage may vary by state. Many states, for instance, treat capital gains as normal income. I've also been asked to reiterate the FI aspects of this technique. I brought this topic up here since FIers may have a more varied income than others from year to year, and this is definitely something to do during those down years or upon (semi) retirement, similar to a Roth conversion ladder.",finance,1482596691

Starting with Gross Salary

Before Taxes, I deduct my 401k, medical insurance, then a standard deduction (6350) and 1 personal exemption (4050) because I'm filing by myself.


That will get me my taxable income.

I subtract federal income tax, state income tax, medicare (1.45%), and social security (6.2%).

That'll get me my total net income! Am I missing anything? The values I get from the calculator are about $500 off than my own spreadsheet. I also don't understand why the tax calculator has FICA listed separately from Medicare - I thought Medicare was part of FICA (Wikipedia).

My wife received $5,400 in tuition benefits this year. How will this affect our tax return? 

I'm assuming that I'm missing some info. On the income form I selected the maximum withholding amounts. 

I lurk here a lot and don't post or comment much because I don't know much. I am following most of the advice here, it's been really helpful.

As a part of the benefit pact my company has with the bank, I'm entitled to take a loan of around 40,000k$, with interest rate of 1% yearly over 84 payment installments.

I can afford the returns, it would be roughly 15-20% of my net salary.

Question is, should I invest money that isn't mine, and if so, what are the recommended channels to do so? I thought about investing it in some index fund, probably S&amp;P500 or something a like.",finance,1482651004

personalfinance,"Loan repayment options, which one is best?","My fiancée recently graduated college and it was time to pick a repayment plan for her loans. She has about $30k in debt. 

These were the options she was given...
Standard Repayment
Pay As You Earn
Income-Based Repayment
Income-Contingent Repayment
Revised Pay As You Earn
Graduated Repayment
Extended Standard Repayment
Extended Graduate Repayment
Income sensitive Repayment
(These repayment options are through fed loans)

I'm not too familiar with any of these options, I automatically went into a standard repayment plan when I graduated. Looking over them and researching what was the best option for her to choose, I thought that the standard was the best. Her payment however is about half of her monthly income. At the time I was concerned that if she chose another plan that whatever was forgiven in 15-20 years she would have to pay income tax on and end up paying back much more. 

Does anyone have experience with this or could give me more insight on what would be the best plan?

I'm interviewing for 2 federal jobs within my current agency.  Disregard what you know about the GS scale and your typical GS-climbing measures, because I have non-competitive eligibility and our agency isn't on the GS scale.

* Current job: 33k, temporary, extended through Oct. 1 2017
* Job Opportunity #1: 42-52k, 1 year temporary (with the ability to be extended).  They want it to start on Jan 9th, so I'd assume that selections will be soon.  I interviewed for it recently.
* Job Opportunity #2: 65-70k, permanent, definitely more up my alley as far as hard skills/long term career development is concerned.  I'm scheduled to interview for it in the first week of January.

Basically, Job Opportunity #2 is definitely the direction I want to go, but I'm barely making ends meet and #1 would certainly be a step forward.  But, because I qualify under certain hiring procedures, I could potentially try to take a **leap** forward.

I'm trying to navigate what the best course of action is.  It is very likely that if I get offered Job #1 (if), it will be before I have even had the opportunity to complete my scheduled interview for Job #2.  That being said, the federal government right now is all about rushing their hiring in lieu of Trump's alleged federal hiring freeze, so everyone is trying to start everything before the inauguration.

If I get job #1, should I just commit to it and decline the interview for #2?  Should I do the interview anyway?  If I do the interview and get selected, should I accept it (and: would I be allowed to accept it?), given that I'll have only been at job #1 for.. a week, maybe?  At that point, I feel like I'd be screwing over job #1 because then they might not be able to fill it before the freeze.

I'm leaning towards ""accept the first job that I get and stick with it,"" because it seems discourteous to renege on something once you've accepted it.  On the other hand, the only person looking out for me is myself, and it may be that I need to be selfish if I get offered job #2 after already accepting #1.  Under no circumstances am I willing to decline #1 to **hope** for #2, because I'm basically living paycheck to paycheck right now (admittedly, a little above my means.)

Basically, I'm looking for a reality check.  I've heard some opinions from friends, but I felt that I'd give PF a try.",finance,1482679346

MachineLearning,[D] Dimensionality of random vector for EBGANs,"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03126v3.pdf

A vector z is sampled which is fed into a generator G that tries to fool a discriminator D into believing G(z) is an actual data sample.

For the MNIST dataset, the data distribution will be highly multi-modal (probably 10 modes for each number). Any mapping from a single dimensional z taken from N(0,1) will not be able to cover much of such a highly multi-modal data distribution. Then if the dimensionality of z is too big, training the generator becomes impossible becomes we need to sample so many different z's to cover most of the input space.

Picking the right dimensionality of z seems to be quite important.

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year everyone!

Federal Civilian Employee  
**Income**  
*Base Pay – ~73K (It fluctuates based on current assignment.  ~60-73K)  
*Overtime – This adds about 60K on top of Base  
*Gross YTD ~ 130K  

**Savings**  
*Checking - ~10K  
*Emergency Fund – 200/month.  ~$2400  
*TSP - $18000/year before employer matching.  I’m a little over one year into the TSP.  ~$21000 in total. 100% C Fund.  
*Personal IRA ~$900.  Not currently contributing.  

**Expenses**  
*No car loan.  5 yr old car.  Great condition, low mileage. Insurance ~$170/month  
*No food (grocery) expenditures  
*Cell phone ~$120/month  
*No CC debt.  I maybe charge ~$100-150/month on gas/eating out/random necessities. $14400 CC Limit  
*Student loans $4000/month ($2000 to Federal, $2000 to Private)  
  *Federal Loans - $9122  
  *Private Loan – $24201   

Currently I live with my parents, but I am only home about 1-2 months per year.  So it’s not a big deal in my eyes.  

My general plan right now is to keep up the aggressive pace on the loans.  Once the federal loans are gone, I’m going to put that $2000 on top of the $2000 for the private loan.  All in all, my loans will be gone before the end of 2017.  I never plan on carrying a balance on the CC.  As long as I continue to have this income, I will max out the TSP.  I don’t do much driving at all (~100 miles per month).  So this car will most definitely last a long time.  There is definitely a house in the near future.  I plan on taking over the mortgage on my parents’ house.  They will continue to live there but I will own it.  That should help them cut expenses in their retirement.  And obviously I will be a homeowner!  Like I said, I’m usually home for 1-2 months during the year.  I plan on taking at least one of those months to do some travelling.      

I haven’t done any investment in stocks before.  The reason I haven’t started yet is because I (upon the advice of others) decided to use that ~6% return that I would get from stocks and just increase my loan payments instead.  

Should I be doing more with the emergency fund?   
I think the C fund is a good idea.  My personal return is ~12%.  Is there a better allocation?  
Once those loans are gone, my expenses will be practically nothing.  What is a good plan for all that money?  Begin investing in stocks?

personalfinance,Opinions on mortgage refinance to pay student debt,"Hello and Merry Christmas! 

I have federal student loans totalling about 145000 - over half of them at 6.8%. I'm currently on track to have them paid off in November of 2024, at $1951 per month. I am not eligible to reap a tax return on the loan. My gross is 150,000 and I put 10% pretax into a 401k.

My question is, is it worth the refinance to pull equity (I'm thinking around 44,000 for an 80% ltv) at a similar rate (current interest rates are similar if not slightly worse than what I have now), to put into my student loans and knock a good chunk off the high 6.8% loans?

I'm currently in a situation I never have been in before. I grew up and my family still resides in illinois, but I attend college in Minnesota. For tax purposes from what I understand though I am still considered a permanent Illinois resident. 

This summer, I worked a paid internship in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I withheld money from each paycheck for federal and Minnesota state taxes, but not Illinois. Since I am a permanent Illinois resident, the income that I made in Minneapolis is still taxable by Illinois though, correct? 

I made about $6,000(rough estimate) from my internship. From what I understand, Minnesota has a personal allowance of $6,300, so any state income tax I would end up paying to Minnesota would be minimal. 

My question is vague, but how would my tax situation work? Will I file a Minnesota tax return, and receive a credit on my Illinois tax return on any tax I pay to Minnesota (if any?), or is it possible to be double taxed in my situation? What additional forms would I need to fill out when I file my Illinois or Minnesota returns?

I'm currently making 43k/year at my full time job, saving about 20k-25k/year. I have 24k in an MMA collecting 1% interest and a thousand or two in ""play money"" scattered around.

I can't decide the best thing to do with the extra money coming in. I'm 31 years old. I'm not trying to wait until 55 to retire, and I don't think retirement is necessarily going to be a fixed state with no income generation. I would like to pursue the arts more - writing and making music. Theoretically, these can become lucrative financially. I say this because it's important to recognize that I'm ok with potentially having to work again, but I don't want to just save money and draw on it every year either. I want to retire early on a low income to free me up to pursue a simple life involving the arts more.

Paying down both properties is a possibility. I've been considering saving enough money to buy another property in cash. I could get a good $$ generator for 50-60k (which means sitting on a bucket of cash for another year). My loans are at 4.5% and I imagine moving forward into the near future that the interest rates will be the same or higher.

While that's all well and good, it leaves the daunting task of trying to think through budgeting for those two years of expenses as well as how best to finance them. I would appreciate whatever insight I can get from the good people of PF.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Costs:**
The school has an estimated total cost of ~$200k for tuition, books/supplies, and living expenses across the 2 years that the program lasts (http://poetsandquants.com/2016/03/07/mba-costs-keep-rising-four-schools-now-200k/2/). This estimate does not take into account the fact that I am also married with one child (my wife doesn’t work, opting to stay home with our child full-time), and I will have to pay living expenses for the two of them as well. I’ve seen some estimates that going through an MBA with a spouse and child adds approximately $30k to the total expense. Looking through some programs’ high-level budget breakdowns (see, for example, [Kellogg](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/tuition-financial-aid.aspx), [Booth](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/programs/full-time/admissions/tuition-financial-aid), and [Wharton](https://mba.wharton.upenn.edu/tuition-financial-aid/)), the estimated budgets feel directionally correct, but I don’t feel qualified to judge whether they match what people *actually* end up spending.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Potential Funding Sources:**
(1) As part of my acceptance, the school offered me a $60k scholarship to use towards tuition
(2) $55k available in liquid savings/investments
(3) Up to $20k from my 401k in the form of a self-loan (not looking to withdraw from it and pay early penalties for obvious reasons)
(4) Up to $41k in Federal Stafford Loans available at a fixed 5.41% interest rate
(5) Private loans at around 6.1% interest rate (available up to whatever amount I could possibly need, essentially)
(6) Some money that will likely come in during a summer internship after my first year. Typical summer MBA internships in my desired industry seem to pay around $8k/month, which is enough that it could cover all living expenses and still allow me to pocket an additional 5-10k for other expenses later on.
(7) Lastly, and most interestingly, a trust fund that was set up for me by my grandfather some time ago to use for my education. I’ve never drawn any money from the trust, instead funding my undergraduate education through scholarships and work. The trust has a current market value of about $190k, of which approximately half of it is in the form of unrealized capital gains.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Clearly being able to draw from the trust is a huge difference-maker (and a benefit for which I feel supremely fortunate). I don't have any idea where to begin, however, in navigating the paperwork, laws, and taxes around it. My limited understanding is that I would need to pay a long-term capital gains tax on the unrealized gains in addition to having to treat all disbursements as household income when I receive funds withdrawn from the trust (and given how much I would likely be withdrawing, the effective tax rate seems likely to be quite large). As a result, at this early stage I feel like I have almost no sense for how much money I could actually expect to have access to from the trust.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**TL;DR:**
I’m looking to attend a full-time 2-year MBA program, but could use PF’s help to: 
(1) Get a more accurate understanding of the likely costs (especially given that I am married with one child) and 
(2) Figure out how best to finance those costs from my available set of options. In particular, I could use help understanding how much money I can expect access to after taxes from a trust set up for me with a current market value of ~$190k.

personalfinance,Living in USA with students loans in the UK,"Hi PF!

I am currently living in the US and have dual nationality with the UK. My student loans are all from/in the UK.

The interest rate on my student loan is approx. 1% and capped at 1.5% - I know this is very very low so likely makes sense to just make the minimum payments and invest/save the rest. BUT obviously exchange rate risk is a real thing (although brexit helped me).

So my question is - does it make sense to pay off my UK student loan ASAP to negate any associated risks, OR continue to make minimum payments and invest/save the rest (this is what I have been doing for last couple of years).

My current strategy is that I am transferring lumps of money everyone couple of months into my UK Bank account - then I use that to make loan payments - logic is: soon the number in UK bank account will equal student loan, ie. student loan paid off technically, but I just keep making minimum payments and money is in the UK so no exchange rate risk and if I REALLY needed it for an emergency I could always transfer back or use it (would not be ideal of course). I think my logic is flawed here though because the cash will just be sitting there not doing anything.

Another area for some advice - I have been contributing enough into my 401k to get my company match, but nothing more - my logic is I that if I move back to the UK in 3 years or 10 years I dont want a huge lump of cash stuck in the US. I figured index funds through fidelity would provide a similar purpose and allow me a little more flexibilty - thoughts?

My specific numbers incase they help or change the advice:

Salary: $100,000

Current US Bank savings: $16,000

UK Bank Savings: GBP: 5590 so approx. $7000

Index Funds: $7500

401K: $14500

Student Loan: GBP: 17600 so approx. $22,000

FYI also getting a $25,000 pre tax bonus in a week, hence why I am asking this question actually

I'm in my mid twenties with no plans to buy an apartment/house etc tomorrow, so no imminent large blocks of cash needed on the horizon.

personalfinance,I can be debt free in 4 months if I pause my savings or 7 months if I continue saving at my current rate,"I have a solid plan going forward for the new year that would allow me to pay off the rest of my student loans ~20k within the coming months.

I can stop contributing to my savings at my current rate and instead contribute it towards loan payments which would allow me to close off my loans in 4 months. My other option is to continue saving at my current rate, which would simply push back the time to payoff by around 2.5 - 3 months.

I have a solid enough emergency fund that I won't be overly concerned about something happening and me not being able to fund it within the next 6 months. The main considerations include the fact that the money I contribute to savings can be making money while I'm still paying the loans off vs. me simply having 0 debt and picking up on my savings after that is done.

What would you do?

Update: Savings in this situation is referring strictly to my saving for a future goal (Goldman Sachs online banking with 1.05% APY). My emergency savings is funded and my retirement savings will be maxed out for the 2017 year with the bonus I'll receive in a few weeks. I think the math is telling me to pay off the loans before going back to my savings contributions. I didn't note before, but I'm 25, so I think I'll have a decent amount of time to recover from the time I'll dedicate to paying off these loans and not saving.

personalfinance,Best strategy to pay off student loans?,"Hi personal finance gurus! First off, let me say that I have both lurked and posted in this sub in the past and have found it infinitely helpful and inspiring to read all the advice given.

So.. I am a 33 year old woman, with zero debt other than my just under $57,000 federal student loans. My sub and unsub loans were consolidated and both have a fixed interest rate of 6.75%.

I was recently approved for the Revised Pay as You Earn repayment plan which will make my monthly payments about $150 a month starting in January. I currently work full time as a therapist at a non-profit and make $50K in the Bay Area CA. I will be licensed soon, and hope my income will get a healthy bump, although this will depend on what type of work I go for after I get my LCSW license.  

I have been actively certifying my employment with PSLF program, and will be three years in (of ten) in July of 2017. 

At this point though I am interested in seeing if it would be more financially, psychologically, and professionally beneficial to just try to pay the loans off as fast as I can although I am not sure where to start in that calculation.  My initial thoughts are that getting rid of the loan as fast as possible will open the doors to more professional opportunities as I would not need to necessarily stay at a non-profit for the PSLF, could begin exploring private practice options, etc. Psychologically, it would be amazing to be debt free in less than seven years, which is how long I have left in the PSLF (and this is assuming that no curveballs get thrown at me and I am able to make all my payments in that time).

My question is - how do I calculate this? What would need to happen for me to pay $57,000 off in (ideally) 3-5 years. Is this financially realistic, or should I just keep plugging away at the PSLF?  

Some other basic financials that might be helpful:

* Own my car outright, 2002 Honda Civic, drive it to death for work, may need to be replaced soonish

* Spend about $150 a month on gas

* Rent is $1100 month, includes all utilities

* I spend about $400/month on groceries, don't really eat out besides a cup of tea now and then.

* Phone is $40 a month, gets reimbursed by work

* 403b through Fidelity with no employer matching, I put $250 a month in that

* Take home each month is about $2600

* Current savings is about $4K

Can I do this? Should I do this? And most importantly, how would I do this?

personalfinance,"401k Pretax vs. Roth for high earning single new grad? Priority of discounted stock vs. IRA, HSA?","Hi all,

I'm lucky enough to be making $115k/year as a new grad. r/personalfinance says [people who see increases in their incomes should do Roth since their taxes will likely increase in the future](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k). While I feel that *my income should increase* (promotions, etc.), I also feel that *I'm already in one of the top tax brackets and that my tax rates should be lower in the future* (single right now, hoping to get married before I retire). 

Thus, **is Roth really the right way for me to go**? 

Right now, my paystub says I've been paying 40% of my salary towards federal/state taxes and I don't really see that huge number increasing in the future. If it helps, I have an employer 50% match on pretax/Roth 401k up to $9k ($18k contrib from me). 

Also, how should I order contributing to the following financial instruments if I can purchase stock at a 10% discount? 

* Pretax or Roth IRA which I believe I have up to $5500/yr
* Health Savings Account which I can max out $2850/yr 
* Stock at a 10% discount. It's a large company, relatively stable company. I need to enroll for a quarter and can put a 0-15% of my salary to it. 
* Emergency fund. I live in an expensive city and expect my monthly expenses to be ~$2300/mo if I don't have a job (+$400 with current job). 
* Investing in mutual funds via Vanguard

Note: I have no student debt and have a relatively stable job. 

What are your thoughts on this order? ([slightly modified r/personalfinance flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/1rPEkGQ.png))

* Max out 401k (via pretax/roth as in first question?)
* Have a 4 month emergency fund ($10k)
* **&lt;-- or should stock be here?**
* Max out IRA
* Max out HSA as that can cover my a$$ like an emergency fund can
* **Max out stock**
* Invest in mutual funds with remainder of $, if any.

What are y'all's thoughts on the order?
I feel that stock although at a discount is variable (even if statistically at a +10% expected value), whereas an IRA and HSA has guaranteed positive tax benefits. 

Also, if I started working four months ago, my income for fiscal year 2016 should be low, meaning my taxes should be low right? (Currently I'm getting taxed pretty highly, ~40%, so not sure if I'll get it back in tax returns)

If I've maxed out my 401k pretax and want to change it to Roth, I can't really do that right? It seems that I can only do so [if I change employers](http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/can-you-roth-ira-rollover-rules-from-401k/).

The credits don't transfer so I had to start college from scratch when I came back to US. I maxed out the subsidized and unsubsidized loans and the rest are through Parent PLUS. All loans are currently in deferment.

I go to a community college costing $2,600/semester. My parents, worried about my large student loan, decided to pay for my community college. They make about $170,000 a year between the two of them, but my father is horrible with savings (and he makes 80% of that) and is currently $11,000 in credit card debt. 

There are about 3-4 more years until I can graduate college. I'm only there part time because I work part time in retail making $10/hr. I've made two $650 payments on the biggest Parent PLUS loan. Because of where we live, most of my money goes to gas (45 minute drive each way to work or college), and the rest I save for the loan payments as I can make them, and a little treat of ice cream or a coffee once or twice a month.

Every semester we fight over how to pay for my college and books. Because of their high income, financial aid isn't available. I failed most of last year because I worked too much and often couldn't make it to class, and now that I'm down to part time it's manageable.

My intention is to leave community college after the fall 2017 semester (with a healthy GPA) and start at the state school for a botany major and math minor, and graduate to find a full time job that would support both monthly loan payments and living expenses (i.e. not with my parents). 

Given how much student loan debt I currently have and how much CC debt my father is currently in, would it be better for me to drop out of school entirely? I have no major skill set and do not live near enough to any city, so finding a full time job would be limited to call centers and maybe secretary work. If I were to drop out I would probably never be able to start college again with all the debt I am in, and at the age of 23 I already feel too old to be this far behind.

The other option was to refinance my student loans through a third party with a lower interest rate, however this would end my deferment completely and require I start making payments immediately. I do not want to live with my parents past 26, our relationship has become strained enough by me living here again, and if I were forced into paying back loans immediately then I would not be able to afford moving out. 

The final option is to take out more loans. I will have to when I get to state school without a doubt, and most of it should be covered until the subsidized and unsubsidized loans, but I had wanted to put off taking more out until I'm at a real college. This all has to get paid back, and the less I have to pay later the better! Which is why I've been trying to make small payments now to take the edge off the final amount.

Which route do I take? My parents did not attend college so they don't understand how important it is for me to graduate, and they favor the first option of dropping out to get a full time job and living with them until I'm 30. Honestly I'd rather die than go down that path, I do eventually want to have a life outside of work and school, but if there's more agreement towards that then I would put more thought into it.",finance,1482815852

Just wanted some insight to see if anyone had run into this problem before. I sent a package a few days ago to Spain via FedEx (Im in the us). The total value of the package was 50 dollars (sent calendars, snacks, luggage tags, notebook, pens, and some luggage tags), and was declared so.

My friend just told me she was told she has to pay 55€ because FedEx thought the value of the package was more and supposedly raised it. I bought the calendars on sale (5 at .99 cents), and I sent her some things I bought from my company store (so I had pretty big discounts when buying). The package was really only worth 50, and not sure why the tax is 55€?

I guess my question is, how do I dispute this? I dont want her paying more than the value of the package in taxes because that seems quite stupid. I had sent her something in the past (similar things: snacks, a shirt, small gift - that were worth more than $50 and she wasnt taxed then...)

Long time lurker and I'm now in need of some advice. Thanks to this subreddit and YNAB I've managed to clean up our my household's finances.  Paid down $20,000 of debt and up until yesterday only carried a measly $5000 student loan debt.  We've dabbled a little in churning and have more than 6 figures of available credit and both my husband and I have 800+ credit scores.  At least I thought so...

Yesterday we purchased a car.  I was quite confident we'd receive excellent interest rate offers.  My husbands score was higher than mine so we put him as the primary.  Both Experian and Trans Union report his score at 837-847 on his credit cards.  I was floored when the salesman came back and the paperwork stated Equifax reported it at 704!

We finished the sale, signed the financing and immediately went home and I pulled his credit reports.  Equifax wouldn't let us pull it up online.  We have to send in a request.  I'm baffled as to what is going on.  I suspect they are reporting erroneous information as his credit history is squeaky clean.  Once I receive the report we will dispute all that we can.

personalfinance,SoFi For Massive Student Loan Debt,"I have massive student loan debt (in the US) as the title suggests. I will not discuss how I got to where I am today but can provide raw numbers to get a general idea of where to go from this point.  


I have about $99,000 in student loan debt broken down into:  

 * Federal Loans (sub+unsub) $47,158 average interest rate of 4.6%   
 * Parent PLUS $34,066 interest rate of 7.9%  
 * Sallie Mae Private Loan $11,633 interest rate of 9.625%  
 *(one of my loans has not processed and is not calculated in these numbers but is $10,250 interest rate of 5.31% and is an unsub grad loan)  

My current credit rating according to TransUnion or the other big one is 762.  


Since two of the loans have high interest rates, one of which is a high balance as well, SoFi seems like it would be incredibly helpful in paying down my debts and saving me money.  I have read on this sub that using SoFi isn't really the best option though and that just paying down the highest interest rate loans first is the best idea. SoFi's website advertises that it can refinance all loans down to a rate of 3.18 or something similar. I have confidence I could get a decent interest rate based on my credit score so is this a good idea? Would the savings be worth it? Would I be disqualified for any government programs like the public service forgiveness program or the income based repayment?  


This is where things get a little wonky. My parents took out a massive Parent PLUS loan without consulting me and assumed that I would pay the bill when it comes. It nearly doubles my monthly payments and is something that I will not be able to cover and afford the cost of living. I know that they are technically responsible for the bill but has anyone had any luck with getting income based repayments through their servicer for a Parent PLUS loan being paid by the student? Am I really responsible for this loan or are my parents and they are just pinning it on me? If I didn't pay this loan, would it hurt my credit or theirs?  


Sorry about all the stupid questions, I come from a family who has zero financial responsibility and I am trying to improve from here. Any help and advice is appreciated but please no reminders about how I shouldn't have taken out these loans. I have undergrad and grad school to pay for so it was worth it.

worldpolitics,Countdown: 25 days until Republic Fall. Trazi regime will deliberately create as deep an economic crisis as possible. Practical steps to prepare,"The first rule of tearing down a republic is ""exploit a crisis."" When there is no crisis, one must be deliberately created. This has been standard operating procedure for the Republican Party for the past two decades. They sabotage government, cite their own crimes as evidence that government doesn't work, and then run against their own record while blaming everyone else for it.

In 2000, they ignored the wealthiest economy and most stable geopolitical situation in human history and ran against Bill Clinton's boner instead, then proceeded to tear down the national interest in short order. America went from the best position it's ever been in to both economic and security crisis within a year of the GOP taking the White House (emphasis on taking, in the larcenous sense). What follows Republic Fall on 1/20/2017 will make that look like Churchillian statesmanship by comparison.

The Obama administration has created a vigorous, strong economy and a world where Americans are not dying in large numbers abroad or in terror attacks at home. In eight years, fewer of our citizens have died in war or in terrorist attacks each year than in a single average month of the Bush era. We can now expect a steady and rising crescendo of chaos and death as the FBI is turned exclusively into an organ for investigating the regime's political enemies and rounding up minorities.
That alone will be devastating to the economy, but far more than that, the regime will deliberately try to destroy the Obama economy as quickly as possible. They need their white racist supporters homeless and hungry soon enough to blame on their predecessors, and in large enough numbers to mobilize as terrorist paramilitaries. Having zero political mandate to do anything, they need to create one through a combination of deliberate crisis and unhinged alternate-universe propaganda. Such crises must always be underpinned by economic suffering - otherwise a regime's followers are unmotivated.
As such, wise citizens - especially those who intend to be effective in resistance - must take steps to guard their own resource viability under the Russofascist occupation. It's nothing fancy. In fact, it's somewhat obvious once it's stated, but it should be stated anyway:

* Exchange some fraction of your savings for diverse global reserve currencies and metals. Become comfortable with the process of these exchanges and familiar with local businesses that provide them. Janet Yellen has said she will remain in charge of the Fed for her entire term rather than stepping down, but that (and secondary damage to the entire world economy by the regime's actions) will merely blunt the damage to the dollar. Do not buy Russian currency even if it would be beneficial. ""Ruck Fussia!""

* If you live in a reliable state, your drinking water is probably safe, but it's wise to build up reserves of drinking water and filter systems regardless.

* Canned food. The purpose of a deliberate economic crisis is for the would-be dictator to impose command economics and pretend to be a hero to those whose support they want while crushing the viability (or even survivability) of populations they want to marginalize. With resource interruptions and command economics, you can expect there would be periods where food is scarce or is suddenly all imported from China with no safety inspections.

So basically common-sense measures as long as you understand what's likely to happen. It may happen immediately or it may occur as a downward spiral, but I would say it's highly likely that serious economic problems and resource interruptions will be seen in some areas of the country within the first year. De facto monopolies will be granted by regime attacks on their competitors, leading to very high prices in some places; resource shortages will occur due to politically-motivated distributions; all sorts of market distortions will accumulate.

This is the nature of criminalized politics. Tyranny and chaos are not opposites - they go hand-in-hand.

I don't have any credit card debt, don't put anything on credit, and don't even have car payments or a cell phone bill associated with my name. 
I just pulled up my Equifax report and noticed that my ""Debt-to-Credit Ratio"" for my student loans is a whopping 138%!! This is presumably because the IBR payments don't cover the amount of interest accruing and my balance is just increasing.

I'm really freaking out about this right now.

personalfinance,synchrony bank loan seems shady,"I took a 5,800 loan out from synchrony bank about two years ago. Since then I've reduced the debt to 3,872, but have paid almost 2,500 (!!!) in interest. I called, and the service rep explained that in May of this year my promotional interest rate had ended. I can't check that far back because the site's activity account will only show me activity going 3 months back (wtf?!) but the interest charges it is showing are each for about $93. So if that started in May, there's no WAY it can have gone up 2,500 in interest since then.

They said I can pay it off and close the account, which my mom has offered to do (and I would pay her back w/out interest). But is there anything else I can do? This kind of interest rate (plus there's nowhere I can even find the actual rates involved, at least on the site) doesn't even seem legal... but idk.

btc,Base money and why we can't take the 21M coin limit for granted,"Debt creates money. Whenever anyone borrows money, money is created. Whenever a bank runs at fractional reserve, money is created. The total amount of ""real"" (non-debt ta.k.a ""base money"") US dollars in 2016 was less than 4 trillion USD. The US federal debt alone is almost 5 times as much. The amount of debt money in the world is far far more than the amount of base money. Most money is created, not by governments, but by private banks giving out loans.

With Bitcoin the ""base money"" is limited to 21M. But there is no reason why banks couldn't run fractional reserve and create many times more BTC. The main reason to believe this can remain limited with Bitcoin is that with Bitcoin it is very easy to control your own money on the blockchain instead of keeping it in a bank. But as soon as people start keeping bitcoins in a bank account, as they do with Coinbase today, banks can start creating bitcoins by giving out loans.

So if we want to meaningfully keep the 21M coin limit, we must make sure that most Bitcoin usage happens on the blockchain. And if we limit the capacity of the blockchain, and ""force"" people to use off-chain solutions, we essentially take the first step in giving up the 21M coin limit.",cryptocurrency,1482877785

personalfinance,"Should I have my parents consolidate the loan they took out for my education, should they transfer it to me, or should I leave it as is?","Hello personalfinance, I hope you can help me once again.  Long story short: My parents have two loans they took out to help pay for my education.  One is actually a consolidation with a balance of $22,800 and 6.375% interest. The other is a Parent PLUS that only has $1500 and 7.25% interest (this one I was planning to pay off in the next month or so).  The interests are fixed.  I make the payments on these loans.  My father sent me a text that he received one of those consolidation letters in the mail (from SoFi) claiming no application or origination fees and a fixed rate as low as 3.50% (with autopay, which I currently already do, but it could be as high as 7.99%).  My current monthly payment is $365 and I could afford paying about $100 more per month if I had to.  My questions are: How do I calculate whether this consolidation would be worth it?  What interest rate do I need for it to be beneficial?  Would they even allow it to be consolidated since the second loan is so low?  Is there any other ideas of how improve the interest rate?  Any suggestions/advice is much appreciated.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m anticipating questions as to why I’m paying my parents’ loans so here’s some back story: When I was graduating high school, I was pretty naive and hadn’t thought about college and didn’t plan on going.  It just wasn’t discussed in my house or at school.  Luckily I had a friend who convinced me that going to University had benefit.  I started asking my parents if they could help pay for college.  At first they said no.  I then asked if I could emancipate (I realize that probably wouldn’t have worked) since I didn’t qualify for grants or unsubsidized loans given they were both high income earners.  They said no to that too.  Then I asked if they could take out a parent PLUS loan for some of the expenses and I’d pay them back after college.  They actually agreed to this and said they would even pay for the loan amounts.  Unfortunately my second year into college, my father said he never agreed to this and told me I would need to start paying as soon as I graduated.  I’ve been paying on it since I graduated.  My parents were incurred a lot of late fees by not paying most of the time before I took it over and I think I’m stuck with a higher interest rate because they consolidated.  I researched transferring the loan to me before (thinking I have better credit and payment history) but read that at least the parent PLUS loan can’t be transferred.

personalfinance,"Let me get this straight, I should focus on investing (401k &amp; IRA) BEFORE attacking my student loan debt?","I've read quite a few threads &amp; comments here and if I'm not mistaken, most of you would suggest that one should invest in their 401k up to their employer's match and max out their Roth IRA before focusing on a low-ish interest debt, right?

A little more info. about me: I make a well above average income and I have no children. My student loans are my only debt except for my mortgage which is locked in at 3.5%. I'm in my mid-thirties but I only have a modest amount of money in my 401K (~$10,000) so I'm playing major catch up on retirement. I have a 3 month emergency fund. It was at 6 months but I was itchy to pay off an automobile debt and I pulled the trigger, cutting my fund in half. 

I'm considering a snowball type method for my student loans by focusing on the smallest loans first. I understand that focusing on the loans with the highest interest rate makes the most sense mathematically but psychologically I prefer seeing those smaller ones disappear. I'll reevaluate as time goes on. 

Here's a breakdown of my student loan debt (account 1 is for my BS and  is account 2 for my MS):

Account 1: $23421.29

personalfinance,Regarding student loan payments; interest vs. principle,"I have 4 federal direct student loans totaling ~23,000.  My income-based repayment amount recently increased, so I thought I'd log in and take a quick look at the payment history, as I'm interested in getting more aggressive toward paying this all off.  

Once within my payment history, I have found out that in the last 8 payments, I have paid them a total of 1335.61, and of that, only 298.38 was applied to principle, with the remainder applied to interest.  My question is how is this possible??  There was one month that I missed, and so paid twice the normal payment the next month to catch up, and I did have one month that was ""delayed"" because I submitted my updated income information which is required annually for my income-based repayment plan.  Regardless, how is it legal to take this amount of my payments for ""interest"" when the 4 loans are 2.5%, 6%, 6.8%, and 6.8%??

personalfinance,Delay Roth IRA contributions for a few years to avoid student loans?,"Hi PF,

I wanted to get your opinion on a financial plan that I may have to put into place, just in case there's something I'm missing or not thinking about.

Starting next August/September, I will (hopefully) be in a PhD program.  The problem is that I may have to move halfway across the country, where I am unable to apply for reciprocity.  My particular field typically reimburses PhD students in a combination of tuition waiver (worth only in-state tuition) and a stipend (for working 20 hours/week as a teaching assistant).  One of my top schools would require my to pay the difference between in state and out of state tuition for one year.  Including estimated fees, books, health insurance, and tuition, the total cost for two semesters would be just over $24k.  After the first year, I would be moved to a resident status, which would only make me responsible for fees, books, and health insurance, which would be $6.5k for the year.

I am not entirely sure what kind of stipend I would get (I currently get $15.5k from my masters, but averages (at least, ones listed online) for PhD students seem closer to $25k-$35k, depending on location).  Assuming I'm on the lower end of the range, I'd be able to save about $600-$800 per month based on some research I've done into apartments and cost of living in the area.  (Rent+utilities+gas+insurance+car payment/car maintenance+food is around $1100 per month)

By the time of the move, I will have saved $14k in combination of emergency fund/moving cost preparedness/retirement contributions.  I have not yet made my IRA contribution for 2016, and I am wondering if I should delay investing my retirement savings, and for how long.  This would allow me to put $8k-$10k towards tuition for the first semester, so that I would not need to take out student loans for the first semester (or, if I did, they would be for just a few grand).  This would still leave money for the emergency fund, deposit on a new apartment, and some funds for traveling.  I would need to take out loans for the second semester, which I could then pay over the remainder of my PhD program (a total of 3-4 years).  I don't really know what to expect for an interest rate on my loans, so if someone has some experience with this I'd love to hear it.

Is this a financially sound plan?  One of my financial goals is to retire early (I'd love to retire or semi-retire in my 40's), so I'm a bit worried about delaying retirement funds.

Other info:  I have nothing currently in my Roth IRA, so there's nothing in there that can earn interest unless I contribute for 2016 or 2017.  I also cannot go on my parents' health insurances, as that would either put a financial strain on my mom or screw up my dad's retirement.

I found that a local credit union will allow me to take a cash out refi for my car of up to $9400. I am skeptical because I have never heard of this cash out refi before with a car.  My car is a 2008 Honda Accord EXL with 102000 miles on it. I plan on keeping it until it dies. 

Come February 2017, I won't owe a dime on my car as I will have it paid off. 

I however would use the money from the cash out refi to pay off about $10500 in credit card debt. I'd look at it more as a personal loan than anything even tho it is considered a car refinance.  

The loan rate is 2.89 percent. I can get a term for five years. I'd obviously pay more than the minimum, but I'm expecting the minimum payment to be a little less than $170 per month. 

Right now, my interest rates on the credit cards vary from 0% to 4.99%. however some the interest rates specials will expire in May, June and Oct of 2017.  The minimum on these credit cards is about $150 per month, until the promotional apr ceases. 

I'm tired of playing the credit card transfer game (emotions are involved hence why I am asking this to see what the correct process is).  Does this taking the cash out refi make sense??",finance,1482936769

personalfinance,Student Loan to Pay Off Other Debt?,"I just received my award letter for financial aid for my masters. The loan would be a federal unsubsidized Stafford loan. My award for each semester is about $5000 more than I need. I have about $5000 in non-student loan debt. Would it be wise to accept the full amount of my award and use the extra to pay off my other debt?

I would continue making payments like I do now, but I feel like it would be easier to just pay the one bill rather than a bunch, and that the interest rate would be lower. Maybe it would even help my credit score? 

Or should I just accept what I need?

personalfinance,Closing Credit Cards,"Hello all!

Have some questions about closing credit card accounts after I finance a new vehicle within the next few months. I was going to wait until after as to not affect my score before securing financing.

Cards with APR, balance, and limit.

Wells Fargo 17% -- 3700/8500

Best Buy (promotional no interest) -- 2600/3000 (this is kind of skewed because I am about to make payments of 300 and 600 due to rebates)

Tire Pros -- 0/800

Gap -- 0/1024

Kohl's -- 0/700

Dell -- 0/1000

Amazon (22.49%) -- 600/5000

So my credit utilization in October was 62%, I have paid a lot down and now it's around 30% I think.

I just find it useless to have the Tire Pros, Gap, Kohl's, and Dell cards and would like to close them out as they have no balance and I don't need to use them really now with my income.

Is this is a wise decision? It should only affect my credit score negatively in the short term, right? And would eventually bounce back if there is any hurt to my credit?

Or should I just keep them open, and never use them?

Also, with the Wells Fargo, Best Buy, and Amazon cards. I would like to keep those. How do you get them to lower the interest rate?

I currently work for $10/hr at my part time job with about 50 hours or more every month ($500 - taxes). My state has no state income tax. I have $3000 in savings right now, I currently go to school but so far I have only had to pay $200 out of pocket. I have used federal student loans and scholarships and I get $500 a semester from my grandparents. I don't spend a lot of my money now, just a few things here and there like pizza every so often or whatever. 

My only monthly expenses are World of Warcraft ($12.99/mo) and car insurance ($54/mo). I usually pay $35 or so in gas a month, but that always changes. That is around $102/mo for my ""bills"". I currently live at home so I don't pay rent/food for a dorm room. I have put ~50% of my earnings into savings recently and it is now $3000.

personalfinance,Figuring out my affordability for first-time house or condo,"Hello, I was looking for advice on affordability of my first time home (looking at houses / condos) and was trying to figure out what is reasonable for me. I've gone through a few affordability calculators and I'm not sure how accurate they are, hence this thread.

Some background, I am looking in the Boston metro area, with real estate prices in the ball park of 400-450k, on a 74k salary. I have 85k in savings currently (but I'm planning to save up to 110k-120k for down payment). I currently save a lot of money because I live at home with my parents, and have 0 debt. I pay about 300$ in bills for cable / phone bill. It is important to mention that I am not looking to buy ASAP, I'm looking at a time frame of late 2017/ early 2018.

I understand the market will probably change but I was looking on advice on some other values I have trouble estimating. For example, how do I calculate debt-to-income? Zillow's calculator tells me something different from other sources. Also is 800$ a year for home insurance a reasonable number? 

Using Zillow's calculator I have some rough numbers:

* Annual Income - 74k
* Monthly Debts - 0
* Debt-To-Income - 36% (let it on default)
* Interest rate - 4% (I realize this can get a lot higher)
* Loan Term - 360 months
* Property Tax - 5k (The area I was looking at had 5k)
* Home Insurance - $800
* HOA fees - $200 (ball parking right now)

Any other general advice or tips for a first home home owner would be appreciative as well. Thank you for reading. 

*Edit - I forgot to ask what is the general tip for monthly mortgage payments? It should not exceed 28%-32% of your monthly gross income?*",finance,1482947030
personalfinance,Rent or Sell current home,"Ive been wanting to get a second opinion on this for a while, and I dont have anyone in my real life to do it with, figured this group can help give honest feedback. 

Anyways, me and my family (wife + 2 kids) are planning on moving to a new area. This is by choice not due to work or anything like that. We want to move closer to work and shorten our commute. We have a nice house in the suburbs that we are deciding whether to rent or sell. So alittle about us financially


Yearly Income: 

2 Paychecks -&gt; 3600 payed biweekly (after tax 401K etc ) = 94K / year post tax deductions etc.

Employee Stock -&gt; approx 30K 

Stock Options -&gt; approx 20K

Bonuses -&gt; approx 10-15K (pre tax)



Cash Savings:

Cash = 21K

Online Mutual Funds Account = 18K

Etrade Company Shares = 118K

Etrade Stocks = 22K (1500 cash)

Investment Firm = 68K


Retirement

Roth IRA = 25K

Trad IRA &amp; 401Ks = 445K



College 529s = 30K



Rental/Current House + Expenses 

Our current house is probably valued at something around 610K, we bought it for approx 585K 2 years back. 4 bedrooms 4.5 baths. 17 years old

Mortgage = 360K

Interest Rate = 3.375

Payment Amount = 2986  ( 20 year loan + some over payments(i know mistake)  )

Other Debt = 0

Credit Card = 500 balance between 2 cards


I do believe the house will go up in value over the next 20 years as this area continues to build and expand. Without speaking to a realtor, it looks like maybe we can get 3000 a month in rent. Again, i havent confirmed this with anyone official, just my suspicion based on zillow houses for rent, that looks somewhat in our range and in our zipcode.


New/Future House

House Range approx 750K (maybe alittle less if lucky) Its going to be a smaller house but in a more expensive area.

Commute would drop from 1 hour to maybe 10mins (for both wife and myself)



Thoughts:  
We are almost definetly going to move as both our jobs are pretty secure, and there is no reason for us both to spend an hour each way commuting. So minus anything unfortunate, we should be moving. I am not very handy when it comes to home repair, so i have to find a handy man soon, and will probably use a rental company to handle the property. I believe they charge in the neighborhoond of 10%, maybe alittle less. I have never done rental before, so i am really new to the process.

I only have to pay 5% down on the new house, and i dont have to pay mortgage insurance. So for downpayment + no rent + any pre move repairs = approx 50k ?

I can refinance my current house, and it would bring my monthly payments down to 2400-2600 maybe, no closing cost. But thats at a higher interest rate and for 30 years mortgage. 

We have daycare expenses that are around 2800/month, but one of my kids is abt to head off to school in september. so should drop by 1000 i would think.

Month Expenses with mortgage/daycare = 9K / month

Question:  
I kind of just want reassurance that we can afford to keep the current house, and if the current rental house doesnt work out, we can afford the loss. I am anticipating if its a disaster, maybe 50K loss and just sell the house. Includes closing cost plus damages etc. Seem reasonable?

Also at 3K per month, how hard is it to find a tenant? And do they tend to be better or worse at maintaining a house? Am i looking at people renting for 1 year at a time or any shot at finding someone for 10+ years? 

Would keeping my current house, be a wise financial move going 10-15 years down the road? 

Also should I look into paying my rental house or my living house off first? Rental house would be quicker, future living house would save us higher interest rate. But i assume i cant deduct the rental interest rate ? I dont know havent looked into that yet.


Do i need to do anything to protect myself from the tenants? Ie they cut themselves on a loose nail, do i have to worry about that? What if they break a window, who is on the hook for that? Like i said i am kind of new to this and i am just trying to make sure i am not jumping in ahead of myself.

personalfinance,Capitol One Phone Call Saved Me 300$+ All Because I Wanted to Lower My Credit Utilization,"So over the past year I have built up a bit of credit debt after I have finally dug myself out of it. Half is my over spending for my income the other was expenses that my emergency fund didn't cover and I didn't forecast needing to buy. But at the end of the day I was at a high of 8500$ in interest building CC debt on a Capital One card. I saw that I had jumped 4k on less than a month and in no way could sustain that. I returned a 8 month old 1000k purchase that was a nice to have but not a need to have and have been putting excess savings toward the monthly bill. The real story begins when I tried to have a debt limit increase 6 months ago while my balance was relatively low, I was denied. More recently to help limit the impact the extra debt would have on my credit score I applied for an increase, I was denied again. Knowing from this sub that sometimes talking to a real person may help I called Capital One. They couldn't increase the limit but as a thank you for being a customer they refunded 3 months interest (368$) and lowered my interest rate by 40% for 7 months. I have in a month dropped my debt to 6500 and hope to continue the rapid decrease. I know the interest return is not a long term solution and unlikely to happen again but it helped me pay down the debt much faster in the near term and save me interest in the long term.

personalfinance,My fiance(32) and me (29) trying to obtain mortgage with 9k student loan debt. Need advice on FHA mortgage. (Long),"I work for the government, earn approx 52k (2,050/mth net), will go up to 55k in June. She is a chef and earns approx 27k(1,500/mth net). 

She has prior student loan that she let go delinquent to qualify to have payments lowered because her income had dropped while injured. She has been paying the student loan again as of about 3-4 months ago. We were told this disqualified her from getting on mortgage and don't know how that works, can she be listed on it or not, and how long must she be current before being added back on.

We are in the process of qualifying for FHA mortgage. Originally we were both listed on mortgage with approval of 200k, home we want 180k, both our credit ratings are low, her approximately 550, mine about 600. She had no remaining debts except student loan. I have one outstanding store credit card I forgot about and never paid back and a foreclosure that won't drop off until 11/2018. Foreclosed around 11/2011, I believe. 

Mortgage broker recently told us that she had to be removed from mortgage because of delinquent student loan. We were originally approved 3.5 percent, which we just found out wasn't locked in as we believed. Now broker is stating that loan percent will be 4.25. Which is a huge increase in monthly mortgage rate, 1,150 to 1,295. With our budget it is still affordable but obviously we don't want to pay more then necessary. Broker told us he could not lock in rate until finalized agreement of sale and the interest rate of original quote from, 12/08/16 is no longer available and current rate as of 12/20/16 is 4.25. 

I don't know enough about any of this to dispute what he is saying and I soft called other agencies which stated with my low credit would be at or below 4%, but that's without running my credit specifically. I live in Philadelphia if that matters for rate. 

Also ideally we both want to be on mortgage, we are excited to start our life together and have been saving up for almost two years, living with serrated family with no time limit on when we have to be out for either of us but it's become a real strain on relationship living apart. We found a house we really like and don't know what to do. We were already in the offer and inspection stage before we knew interest rate had gone up, it was never stated to us, just showed up differently on documents we were signing, didn't finish signing documents so we could get info on what happened. We collectively have about 13k saved up so with sellers assist can manage closing costs without fully draining account. 

Main thing we need help with is figuring out when/if she can be put back on mortgage and if that would help rate, if rate we are quoted with just my information is correct, and if settlement isn't until 02/24/17. if we have time or ability to get another mortgage lender. Also if you have any other advice, guidance, wisdom to bestow we are all ears. This experience has made me feel more ignorant then I ever have before and just have no clue what we should do. 

good news is our offer will almost certainly be rejected, asked a little more then we wanted so we could negotiate down to what we actually want so we may be able to back out if needed, even though we hope that isn't what we should do.

TL;DR we put in offer on house, find out interest rate went up .75%, she couldn't be listed on mortgage anymore, and now if they accept offer payment will be almost 150 more per month then expected and we don't know if we are getting screwed or if we have options to go to other broker or not.

personalfinance,"Researching High Yield savings accounts. Deciding between Ally, Barclays, Barclays Dream and Discover, any thoughts/suggestions?","I just turned 33 back in September and after the birth of my daughter almost three months ago, I decided to take a more active approach regarding my financial future.  I have been using Chase for years and have zero issues with their service or the bank itself, but as you all know, their interest rate on their savings accounts is only .01% and much lower than competitors offer.  I should have done this years ago, but I decided to switch to an online account that offers at least .95%.

I plan on depositing at least $5,000 (might keep a few thousand in my chase account) and haven't decided on my monthly deposit contribution yet, but my initial thought is around $500 per month.  I'm 33M, made $86K this past year (income will increase next year) and live in Fairfield County in CT, which can be pricey.  What is the appropriate amount that should be deposited each month into a HY savings account?  What percentage of net pay is adequate?

After doing my research through various blogs, websites, etc., I narrowed down my choices to Ally, Barclays, Barclays dream and Discover.  They all have great reviews and don't have any maintenance fees, which is a plus.  Even if there is a slight fee that I have overlooked (due to minimum deposit amount, minimum monthly balance, etc.), the amount I plan on opening the account with and the amount I plan on depositing monthly, will offset any fees.

Why did some of you choose one over the other?  If one offers 1.05% compared to .95%, then the natural inclination would be to take the higher interest rate.  Discover offers .95% and received great reviews for their customer service (CS), ease of deposit or transfer (D/T) and their website (WS) for example, but Ally received rave reviews for their CS, D/T and WS as well, but they offer 1%.  Wouldn't it be better to simply use Ally?

On a side note, if I chose Barclays, I would open up both a Barclays and a Barclays dream account, so that I would qualify for the extra bonus with a dream account...any thoughts?

On a side note, I contribute to a simple IRA through work, but what other suggestions do you have for me that I should be doing as well?  Which stocks and bonds would you suggest, or should I contact the broker that handles the simple IRA for my agency?  Thank you in advance for your comments.",finance,1482956560

personalfinance,Stocks vs Bonds Question,"Hi everyone.  As part of my 401k I have a bond index fund.  However, I don't understand what is ""good"" for a bond.  

For example, if I buy a stock I want the price to go up so I can sell it at a higher price.  Things like good earnings reports, good economic reports, etc. could make a stock price go up.

Now what I'm confused about is bonds.  I read that for bonds: ""When yields go up, prices go down."" But I also read that a bond's yield is your rate of return.  So that means if I buy a bond and the yield goes up then the price of the bond goes down so I'm losing money...but since the yield went up I now have a higher rate of return? So is this good or bad? A higher rate of return seems good, but a lower price is bad.  Why is this the case?

Furthermore, I hear about the federal reserve raising interest rates.  This raises yields correct? But it also lowers bond prices? So is this good or bad?

Sorry if this is a basic question.  I tried to do some research by looking at past threads and googling information but I'm having trouble connecting/interpreting information.  I'd appreciate it if someone could explain this to me as I understand stocks but not bonds.",finance,1482960321
Bitcoin,Blinded bearer certificates,"A while ago [I wrote a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4xy0fm/scaling_quickly/) about quickly scaling via federated sidechains, which generated a lot of good discussion. Now I'd like to bring people up-to-speed on another semi-centralized solution to scaling quickly, and this one also solves anonymity. It's called *blinded bearer certificates.* This is an idea well-known by Bitcoin experts, based on a paper by David Chaum written in *1983*. Because all of the experts are familiar with the idea and are not terribly interested in it on an intellectual level, it is not discussed much. But people who don't study this stuff probably won't know about it, and it could be very usefully applied to Bitcoin.

As applied to Bitcoin, it would work like this:

* N people who are independent and widely considered trustworthy come together to create a multisig address. You need 80% (or whatever) of the N people to agree in order to send money secured by the multisig address. This multisig group is called ""the bank"", though it ideally should not actually be a single monolithic organization, but rather a more decentralized selection of independent entities.
* People interested in using the system (or, more likely, people interested in acting as market makers) will send x satoshi to the bank's multisig address and receive x signed certificates, one certificate per satoshi. Each certificate is signed by the bank (ie. because the bank is a multisig arrangement, each certificate will have multiple signatures); however, the signing is done using a technique called *[blind signing](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm)*, which makes it so that although anyone can see that the certificate was signed by the bank, the bank will not in the future know when it signed which certificate. In other words, when the bank sees a signed certificate in the future, the bank will only know that the certificate is any one of the currently-unspent certificates, not *which one* it is.
* People with the initial certificates can now send them to others. Simply giving someone the signed certificate is all the sender needs to do to transfer it. (Therefore, transacting over a secure channel is important.) The recipient has to then do some work in order to prevent the sender from double-spending: the sender gives all of the received certificates to the bank, creates new certificates, and has the bank blind-sign all of those new certificates. The bank marks all certificates used in this way as spent in a database, preventing the sender from successfully double-spending. If the sender tries to double-spend, the the second recipient will immediately get an error when trying to get those certificates reissued by the bank, and should therefore cancel their end of whatever transaction they were doing. Again, the blind signing prevents the bank from knowing the source of any coins transferred in this way, so anonymity is very strong.
* After any number of transactions, someone with some certificates can give them to the bank and instead of having them reissued, they can have the underlying BTC sent to their Bitcoin address.

For simplicity, above, each certificate was worth 1 satoshi. You can instead do a mixture of certificate denominations for increased space and time efficiency. If the sender doesn't have the correct denominations for a particular trade, then he can have the bank transform some higher-denomination certificates into lower-denomination certificates; there's no need for change from the recipient. For anonymity, there should be only a small number of different denominations. It's possible to make certificates divisible, but this complicates the scheme and probably harms anonymity.

Blinded bearer certificates have a number of excellent properties:

* Transactions are *very* anonymous, more so than basically any proposed enhancement to the decentralized Bitcoin system.
* Transactions are instant.
* It is very scalable; even the bank doesn't need particularly powerful servers. Because not much work is involved by the bank, fees would probably be very low.
* Transactions are in many ways easier than Bitcoin ever was: all you have to do in order to send money is give the recipient a file containing a bunch of certificates. If convenient denominations are used, these files may be small enough to copy/paste in the same way that OpenPGP messages are often copy/pasted. Unlike some proposed systems, there's no need for the sender and recipient to both be online when the payment is made.
* It's possible for contracts to be used, and these contracts can be much more complex than is possible on a decentralized system because the contracts will be evaluated by a small number of centralized entities. For example, you could have contracts based on the price of something according to a website, which would be impossible on any reasonable decentralized system. However, actually *using* contracts (which is optional) might allow the bank to link transactions, since they have to see the contract (in the absence of homomorphic encryption magic).

The obvious flaw, and the reason why this idea never took off despite being known and possible since 1983, is that the bank is a single point of failure and can steal all of the money. However, *when built on Bitcoin's decentralized contracts system*, it's possible to spread the trust out far more than was possible previously. If the ""bank"" is composed of 20 trustworthy and totally-independent entities in 20 different countries, and 80% of them have to turn evil in order to steal the money, then it seems to me that the system is secure enough for smaller values (less than a few hundred dollars in total value tied up in these centralized certificates, say). It'd additionally be possible for wallets supporting these certificates to automatically diversify among different issuing banks, spreading out the risk even more. For example, a wallet might ask the user how much money it trusts BankA with, how much money it trusts BankB with, etc., and then automatically trade certificates between all of the banks to ensure that these limits are not long exceeded.

This would be an excellent shorter-term solution to the problems of scaling and anonymity. It requires no changes to Bitcoin itself, and the technologies are not that difficult, requiring no complicated P2P network or anything. (Later on, as technologies mature, I'd expect decentralized solutions such as Lightning to replace these certificates in almost all cases.)

[Open Transactions](http://opentransactions.org/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Voting_Pools) already mostly implements this idea, but IMO it's way over-designed, to the extent that hardly anybody is willing to figure it out.

Hello r/personalfinance. I am having a difficult time with my student loans and was looking for some input. I’ve seen great posts in the past and want to get opinions, advice, etc. on my situation.

Like most people lately, my student loans are ridiculously high. I joined the National Guard right after high school and did not take advantage of National Guard scholarship and instead got sucked into for-profit nightmare The Art Institutes. I am left with quite a few student loans, as well as some pay-back for my National Guard contract ending early due to general discharge marked with an asterisk*.



Student Loans:

Sallie Mae: (A combined $611/mo)
- $7,512.85 at 3.875%

-$11,517.13 at 8.625%

-$14,124.06 at 8.625%

-$15,736.04 at 7.625%

Wells Fargo: $20,388 at 4.74% ($175/mo)

AES: $2,747 at 9.1% ($25/mo)

Federal Loan: $32,823.39 at 6.6% ($125/mo income-based repayment)


Sallie Mae loans are on a 12 year repayment which they will not extend and I have no forbearance to use. Wells Fargo is on a 15 year repayment. I have previously applied for a Wells Fargo Consolidation for my Sallie Mae loans as well, which was denied. Federal loans are income-based and every year rise due to this.



Other bills:

Rent at $577/mo (1br, moving home or roommates to save money is not an option) 

Car payment: $236/mo (interest unknown) 

*Department of Treasury: $200/mo (will be paid off April 28) 

*Ohio Attorney General: $1820 at $50/mo until paid 

Electric: varies, $50-100/mo 

Gym: $40 



Salary:

My pay is hourly ($19.84/hr), and every two weeks I make at minimum $1175 after taxes. I am single with no kids and claim no dependents, so my deductions are at maximum. My monthly bill total is $2044 and monthly salary is $2350.

My dad is my cosigner for my student loans, so it is imperative that I pay bills on time to protect his great credit. I am unable to ask for family help on these loans, while my family is very generous, student loans are strictly my responsibility and my dad is not an option in this matter.

Do I have any options on getting these lowered, or a better game plan on them? Sallie Mae absolutely will not extend or give me any help. I am considering another Wells Fargo consolidation loan, which my dad will cosign for, to attempt to absorb at least 2 SM loans to make the payments a bit low.",finance,1482962622
ethereum,Monax (formally Eris Industries): Intresting Blockchain thoughts for the New Year,"Dear all,

Hello again! 

Happy holidays (and a slightly early happy new year) from Monax!

Please find our monthly newsletter below. If you've got any questions or are interested in learning more about any of the technical and commercial matters we cover below, we'll be happy to continue the conversation one-on-one. Please feel free to reach out to us directly.

Best,

The Monax Industries team.

SWIFT and Monax feature in CoinDesk

Everyone's favorite industry news outlet, CoinDesk, had a long chat with SWIFT about the ISO 20022 and corporate bond prototypes they built with the Monax platform and why, in particular, they chose it. (Full article here)

Preston Byrne, our marmot-obsessed COO, features in the article. We'll spare you his quotes and provide you instead with this one from the author of the piece, Michael del Castillo, who explained why SWIFT chose Monax:

""...the Swift team had anticipated that the underlying technology would need to provide a permissioned blockchain solution that could only be viewed by relevant counterparties and regulators, be capable of supporting smart contracts, and employ a faster consensus algorithm than bitcoin’s proof-of-work. The reason for that demand is that bitcoin’s blockchain is capable of transacting about 600,000 transactions per day, whereas Swift sends on average about 26 million messages during the same period.""

Or, as Daft Punk might put it, ""Harder, better, faster."" The article continues: 

""Swift also selected (Monax)... because the building blocks of its products are open-source. Apparently, all Swift’s blockchain team had to do to begin work was scroll down to the the bottom of the Monax website and download the software for their operating system.""

If you want to be like SWIFT and get started with rolling your own chains for free, today, head over to our documentation and select our quick start tutorial. Monax SDKs and Premium Support We're pleased to announce the launch of our our first two product lines for the FOSS Monax developer stack: SDKs and Premium Support products.

The anchor of the commercially-viable blockchain application: settlement finality This month the US Federal Reserve published its working paper on distributed ledger technology. It’s a deep discussion of DLT in central banking and settlement context. We recommend a read, particularly because the Fed issued guidance on something marmots have known all along: financial market infrastructures function on deterministic settlement, not probabilistic settlement.

Clearing and settlement in financial markets depends on settlement happening at a precise moment in time, so that deterministic calculations can be made regarding liquidity and risk.

Settlement finality becomes a critical legal engineering issue when thinking about financial market infrastructure in the context of public chains with proof-of-work consensus mechanism. In existing public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is a very small chance a previously committed settlement could be ""rolled back"" or reversed due to the network converging on a different branch of the blockchain. If that were to happen, and the transaction were to be eventually included in a later block than that in which it was first placed, this would have the result that the transaction would have been in an indeterminate state at the moment when the system needs to make precise calculations regarding risk and liquidity. This means that “legal liability may be difficult to assign or be ambiguous in such a network, and the uncertainty has implications for the balance sheets of participants as well as the rights of their customers and creditors.”

We understood this problem long ago - which is why we built our permissioned ErisDB blockchain client back in 2014! Permissioned chains do not have the same problem as public chains - as soon as a transaction is entered into a system (and can be shown to have been so), settlement has occurred, with the blockchain acting as a mere reconciliation engine between the various parties and/or stakeholders to the transaction. 

Put differently, private or permissioned chains conform to market participants' expections about settlement finality as set out in market practice and legislation such as 17 CFR 39 or Directive 98/26/EC. Public chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum do not - and never will. 

2017: Year of the blockchain pilot Last but not least, as it's the end of the year, we wanted to trade some notes with everyone about what to expect from 2017. 

One word, just one word: pilots.

We've been around since before blockchain was actually a ""thing,"" so we remember when most banks - to say nothing of other kinds of companies - had only one ""blockchain guy"" in their organisation, two if they were lucky. 

That was early 2015. By January 2016, many banks had had a chance to experiment and put small teams in place - teams which have spent the year running different proofs of concept (a fair share of which we marmots participated in, including a 40-bank R3 PoC back in March. 

In the POC stage, we determine “fitness of purpose,” i.e., we ask ourselves whether the technology - which we find quite interesting - makes sense, and works, within the customer's business context. 

More exciting for us is where we see the space going next: pilots, testing smart contracts in the real world. Which is what we think 2017 is going to be all about. Once fitness of purpose is established, pilots test a problem solving tool and theory in a controlled, finite, but very real environment dealing with real people (who can, at times, be really unhappy). They are low-risk, high-reward exercises when properly controlled and scoped: if problems arise, damage is easily contained, and the allow us to test our theories and hypotheses in a way that only a front-line commercial deployment can.

That said, as we move past POC to pilots and production, legal-technical issues that are often ignored during prototype development become very important. Commercial legal ecosystems work in an increasingly complicated stack, with the simplest, most fungible functions on at the bottom level (i.e. an account balance) differentiating into nonfungible, complex commercial relationships (i.e. a bond). 

When building software that models these relationships, you'll get there more quickly if you have lawyers involved (even if they're not providing legal advice). So just a friendly reminder that Monax's legal engineering team knows how to make these disciplines blend - not only have we got the best blockchain engineering team in the business, we've got the most commercially and legally astute blockchain engineering team as well.

personalfinance,Balance transfer advice,"Hello, PF! 
I am considering playing the shell game with some of my credit card debt with the goal of minimizing interest paid. I've laid out the cards, balances and interest rates and would appreciate any insight you fine folks have to offer. 

Card A: 11% interest, 0% balance transfer special until Jan 18 with 4% upfront fee.
Current balance to limit ratio: $4,500/$10,000  

Card B: 10% interest, 0% transfer special until Apr 18 with upfront 2% fee.
Current balance to limit ratio: $4,800/$14,000  

Card C: 22% interest
Current balance to limit ratio: $1,700/$2,500  

Goal: Minimizing interest.   
Option 1:
Transfer the balance of Card A to Card B, then transfer the balance of Card C to Card A. This will leave Card C paid off.  
  
Option 2:
Transfer the balance of Card C to Card A; leave everything else alone. This will leave Card C paid off.  

Option 3:
Leave everything as is, throw all extra money at Card C as quickly as possible.   

Notes: I am unable to balance transfer Card C to Card B, since they are managed by the same parent company and do not allow this. I am aware that the creditors will apply payments to the higher interest balances first. And yes, I am killing Card C when it is clear because 22% is ridiculous. 

Which of these options is the best fit for my goal? I am paying more than the minimum payments as much as I can. I am not interested in a full blown budget review at this time, just trying to make the best decision for this goal. Let me know what additional information you need to send awesome advice!

personalfinance,Happy New Year to me! Just got an offer essentially doubling my salary!,"So I've been working for one company since graduating college (4.5 years). I'm an engineer and I just earned my Professional Engineering license (a somewhat prestigious designation). 

I receive stellar reviews but for some reason my pay had never really matched my responsibilities as I moved up. I honestly feel my boss didn't like me because I'm not your typical design engineer (I am a very social confident person). I started at 57k and have been promoted twice (most recently without a pay increase). My current salary is 67k. A new hire level I engineer makes 65k. This has me fuming.

I recently had my annual review, received stellar reviews, and my boss admitted I'm underpaid and ""I don't know how this happened"". We will revisit your pay in April when we do pay pay raises. I had done my research, and a city engineer with my experience makes 77k, and I work for a private company often working 60-70 hours a week. So, 77k would be the low number. My company is stingy with raises and I knew they wouldn't give me a raise of 15% at once. They have a philosophy of hiring new grads, working you to death, then letting you go when you get a new job and repeating the cycle; despite the fact it screws over the other engineers who have to pick up the slack. Anyways I tell my manager that I know they won't give me the double digit percentage raise, so they need to give me one now, and then in April to put me around 77k. Manager agrees to talk with the director of engineering immediately after our review. The whole thing was professional and friendly.
The next day I was called into my managers office, my manager has a very different tone, very defensive and aggressive. ""Here's what we are going to do, we will give you a 5-6% raise in April and you can do what you want with that information"" I replied, well I'm disappointed to hear that but thank you for your efforts, got up and walked out. I knew at that point I would be moving on.
Start putting out my resumes immediately, the work I did is unique and my resume is pretty impressive for a 4.5 year career. I couldn't believe how fast I got responses, almost anything I applied for I received an interview offer. Took a few days off last week and this entire week. Had interviews with three companies, one had a soft offer of 105k. Holy shit that's awesome. Had my third and final interview with another company and they asked if I had any other offers. I said yes, and said 110k, hoping they would give me 110k. Got the offer in writing at 120k! Dude this changes my life.

I do have roughly 35k in federal student loans paying the income based repayment plan. No credit card debt, and 6k left on a low interest (4.5%) car loan. I have about 8k in savings. I have a credit rating around 740-760 depending on scoring system.

Not necessarily here for advice just so pumped I had to share but any advice is appreciated. I do want to propose to my gf soon and we would like to buy a house in the next year or two.

US - Taxable Benefit Calculation

The IRS considers the personal use of a company-provided vehicle to be an economic benefit (non-cash compensation) to the driver. XXXXXXXX is required to measure the taxable fringe benefit associated with the personal use of the company-provided vehicle. Even though drivers pay a personal use fee for driving a passenger-type vehicle, this fee might not be sufficient to cover the driver's taxable benefit for the personal use. In most cases, the personal use fee covers approximately 18% personal use without additional taxable benefits (imputed income).
 
Drivers are required to report business versus personal mileage each month-see Fleet Policy - Personal Mileage Reporting. The last day to report for the entire fleet fiscal year is November 10.
 
Calculation of Year-End Imputed Income
There are four components in calculating the fleet imputed income:

Annual Lease Value-The amount established by the IRS based on the original value of the company vehicle multiplied by

Personal Use Percentage-Calculated by the reported personal miles divided by total miles (unreported months will include 1,500 personal miles at 100% personal use) plus

Fuel Benefit-The fuel benefit is calculated based on fuel purchase transaction dollars purchased during the assignment of the driver multiplied by the Personal Use Percentage calculated above minus

Personal Use Fee-The total of the personal use fee paid to XXXXXXXX between the period of November 1 through October 31
In mid-November each year, the ""gross"" taxable benefit calculation is provided to XXXXXXXX's Fleet Manager from YYYYYYYYYY. Payroll provides XXXXXXXX's Fleet Manager with the personal use fees collected from the driver between November 1 and October 31--these amounts are subtracted from the ""gross"" taxable benefit calculation. The net taxable benefit (if any) is reported to Payroll approximately November 20 for inclusion on the driver's first pay check in December. No refund will be made for any excess personal use fee deductions exceeding the fleet imputed income.
 
No corrections to the taxable benefit calculation will be made after November 10.
 
Taxable Benefit Report
When the driver enters mileage on YYYYYYYYYY's web site, the calculated ""benefit summary"" can be found by clicking on ""Edit/View Report-Current Year"". At the bottom of the report is the ""gross"" calculation-YYYYYYYYYY does not have access to XXXXXXXX's personal use fee so it is not included with the online calculation. This online report provides the driver with the current ""gross"" taxable benefit based on the months reported and displays the impact for non-reported months.
 
Taxes Withheld on First December Paycheck
XXXXXXXX has elected not to withhold federal or state income taxes on the net fleet taxable benefit. Drivers should consider this when preparing a Form W-4 or estimated tax vouchers to avoid underpayment of taxes or tax penalties. FICA taxes (if the driver's wage has not exceeded the FICA wage limit) and local taxes (where applicable) will be withheld from the driver's first December paycheck.
 


United States - Personal Use Fee

Rate
The personal use fee is to offset XXXXXXXX's costs in the personal use of specific passenger company vehicles in those instances where personal use is allowed (sedans, passenger vans, and pickups). There is no option to not pay these fees for taxable vehicles.

 
Most drivers of taxable company vehicles use the vehicles 20% for personal use - commuting, personal errands, personal travel, etc. Since the employee is not paying for fuel, maintenance, or deprecation of the company vehicle during personal use, the personal use fee is collected. This amount may change at any time based on management's discretion.  Current rates are after-tax (prorated by the week):

Payroll deduction rate for a compact vehicle is $XX per pay check (bi-weekly)
Payroll deduction rate for a sedan is $XX per pay check (bi-weekly)
Payroll deduction rate for an SUV or larger vehicle is $XX per pay check (bi-weekly)

 
Also see the Fleet Policy - Taxable Benefit Calculation.

 
Payroll Deductions
Both the start and stop of the payroll deductions are based on a weekly report generated by YYYYYYYYYY identifying all changes in vehicle assignment during the week and also the ""onroad"" and ""offroad"" dates of the vehicle. Types of delays for the start/stop of the deduction:

Delay in completing an Assignment Change Form;

Delay by the dealer notifying YYYYYYYYYY that a vehicle has been delivered; and

Delay in completing a Termination Form

 
Arrears will be included with the first payroll deductions until the personal use fee is current with the pay period end date. For example, if no deduction has started and the driver has had a vehicle for three weeks, the first two pay checks with the personal use fee will include arrears (the first check will have two weeks of arrears and the second check will include one week of arrears). Thereafter, the correct personal use fee will be deducted for the pay period represented by the pay check.

 
Any over charges to the driver will be refunded based on the date the vehicle was returned to the branch office. Timely completion of an Assignment Change Form or Surplus Form will provide more accurate charges to the driver.

 
If a driver's payroll deduction has not started or was not stopped, contact XXXXXXXX's Fleet Manager as soon as possible.",finance,1482964185
ethereum,Thinking about PoS as a Monetary System,"The process of staking coins to earn a reward is analogous to purchasing short term government bonds to earn interest.  Here are some observations on the functioning of government bond markets that might be useful to consider during the development of Casper.

1)      Risk Free:  Investors in government bonds do not expect to take losses.  Casper makes similar representations – if you don’t try to cheat, you won’t lose your stake.  Just as there are standard types of government bonds, will there be standard types of staking contracts that any layman can park their ether in and not worry about unintentional loss?  The Mauve paper gives some reassurances here, but it’s difficult to understand how lost stakes would be handled due to bugs in a sanctioned staking contract. 

2)      Market Clearing Rate:  In a traditional monetary system, short term government bonds represent the most crucial price signal there is – the risk free rate.  This is the pure price of money before other risk premiums are stacked on top – duration risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, equity risk etc.  This price of money, or interest rate, is traditionally set by the aggregate supply/demand from all the lenders and borrowers in the monetary system.  Modern day Central Banks have ruined this concept of a market determined price of money.  Casper has an opportunity to build a system immune to such centralized manipulation.  How will staking rewards fluctuate with changing a supply of stakers?  What is the effect on staking rewards if every ether wants to stake vs only 1% of ether wanting to participate?

Interest rate history shows us that cash has typically found equilibrium at low single digit interest rates, with occasional spikes following excesses of credit creation (the Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate pricing at 15% last night is a timely example).  Are these historic interest rate ranges applicable to an Ethereum monetary system?  How might these ranges influence the boundaries for minimum/maximum rates of staking rewards?  

[History of Interest Rates](http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-5000-years-of-interest-rates-2015-9)

3)      Repurchase Agreements:  Modern monetary systems use capital markets to form new pools for capital investment.  Equity capital formation is already taking place on Ethereum in the form of the ICO market.  Debt capital formation will logically follow and staking will mark the beginning.  Repurchase agreements (repos) are a fundamental component of debt capital formation in developed economies and are crucial to the liquid functioning of money markets.  This arcane market is over $2T in the United States and its functionality will likely be built into whichever crypto community develops a monetary system around their tokens.  For example, let’s say you stake some ether for a 4 month term at a 4% interest rate.  After 3 months you find yourself in a liquidity emergency and need access to your funds.  The staking contract cannot offer you liquidity for another month…so the repo market becomes your source of liquidity.  A repo-counterparty bids on your remaining 1 month staking term and a market is made when you accept the offer.  At that point the price of 1 month, risk-free liquidity might be 2%, 4% or 10%, but the market is left to figure it out for itself.  The Mauve paper suggests that the return address for staking contracts can be an intermediary account with its own logic.  Are there any security risks created by building repurchase agreements into the staking process?

TL;DR – A switch from PoW to PoS is more than just an upgrade to the network’s energy efficiency.  PoS will create a risk-free rate of return for cash investments, which is the foundation of a modern monetary system.  Choosing a mechanism for setting this price of money should be approached with the market clearing forces of supply/demand at the forefront of consideration.",cryptocurrency,1482964513
personalfinance,Pay student loans with Series EE savings bonds?

I will have $2250 or so of income from a startup I am interning at by the end of the semester.

Also, these were issued to me as early as 2002, so are they still earning 2002 interest rates, or are they earning 2016 minuscule rates?",finance,1482966072
personalfinance,How would you do this?,"Hi there,

I'm 26 years old, with $12k in savings and $8k in low interest student loans. My credit score is 765.

My original major was Psychology. I went to graduate school for 2 years and left abruptly after deciding it wasn't for me. 


I got a job at a company that specializes in adult films (don't ask), and after a promotion began to make $20/hour full-time along with some commission for affiliate sales.



Fast-forward to now. Living with my girlfriend and our cat, rent+utilities (for me) is about $810/month. Health insurance is $194/month. 




I've been accepted to an online Computer Science B.S. degree program (it's a good program) and I have decided I want to pursue the accelerated track (1 year full-time). However, that will nuke my income down to essentially zero for a year, while also requiring me to pay for life expenses + tuition for the year ($28k tuition, expected $15k-20k expenses). 





Looking at this as a huge investment is the only way I've been able to feel comfortable registering with the university and leaving my job. After all, this job is not a career by any means... but it pays the bills. I have been attempting to work out a way to work 10 hours/week remotely (or simply remaining as an affiliate) but my boss has been supremely absent for the past 2 weeks. This is my final week and I'm unsure if my income will be anything in 9 days.






So in summary, I might be looking at $15k in federal loans spread over the next year (maxed, around 3% interest, yay), but with only $12k in savings I will also need to probably take out an additional $15-20k in private loans (for which I've been approved at around 8% fixed via Credible.com).





The program is also supposed to be very challenging (1 year accelerated;No Shit, right?)






**Would you go back to school if you were in my position?**





When would you take out the private loans, if at all? I would imagine my 'Excellent' credit will drop when I take out the first Federal Loans next month. By then, I may not qualify for 8% private interest.





Is my $45k/year income worth giving up for $30k+ MORE debt and the prospect of a B.S. in CS? If you think so, what sub-field would you focus on in order to go for the quickest debt payoff?





Thanks for any and all responses... and also thanks for reading. I know it's not formatted well but I am having a minor existential crisis at the idea of quadrupling my student debt instead of continuing on my current path. Investment... Investment... Investment...",finance,1482968675

personalfinance,Should I get a personal line of credit in lieu of a credit card?,"I was doing some reading and came across personal lines of credit. It's something I've heard about in the past, but never really given any thought. After looking into it, it seems to me that credit limits are about the same as my credit cards (I'm a student in medical school, with relatively good credit). The interest rates on lines of credit, however, seem to be lower (though I'd have to confirm with my own bank by visiting a branch).

Since I'm a full time student, I tend to have a high revolving balance on my credit cards until my loans come in at the beginning of the term, at which point I pay off my two cards in full. At some point I was bad with money and I ended up in this cycle of spend money on the credit cards and pay it off when loans come in and start over.

Given that I'm paying the interest on my revolving balance almost monthly, would it make more sense for me to get a personal line of credit? What are other things I may not have considered about this option that sets it apart from a credit card?

Also, I realize the ideal thing to do is to get into a situation where I start using the loans to pay my current living expenses rather than use a credit card which will be paid off at the NEXT disbursement, but I'm not in a position to be able to do that at this point. Medical school takes up 90% of my waking hours so there's no time to work, and my expenses at this point are rent, food, and going out two or three times per term when I don't have an impending exam. Overall, my non-essential expenses, per term, are negligible in comparison to essentials. 

Edit: Some numbers:

* Avg revolving balance right before  loan disbursements: $5,000
* Avg loan disbursement: $6,000
* Loan disbursements per year: 3
* Other income: $0
* Other assets/investments: $0
* Total student loan debt at the end of medical school with annual increase in tuition factored in: $225,000-$250,000

B) $1,720
C) $1,972
D) $2,698
E) $4,255
F) $6,897

G) $8,386

As you can see, loan G is throwing a monkey wrench into my plans because I'm not quite sure how to calculate the appropriate percentage to contribute towards this loan each month. It carries a lower interest rate than the rest but at the same time has a much higher principal.

personalfinance,How much can I contribute to Roth IRA?,"Hello!

Today I started investing. I took $5,000 and split it across three Vanguard ETFs (10% BND, 60% VTI, and 30% VXUS).

I also want to open up a Roth IRA. If I open one tomorrow, how much can I put into it? I did not work much this year (I'm a student).

I have a gross pay for 2016 (August and September) of $795 with take home of $667.01 (that's with federal, social security, and medicare taken out). If I open an account tomorrow, does that mean I can put $667.01 into the account?

personalfinance,"Upside down on car loan, no longer have steady income","Hi Reddit!

I'm needing some advice/help. I'm 24 years old and I'm an IT contractor. I have ~$12.5k owed on my car that I purchased when I was making decent money (~$55,000) 2 years ago. My monthly payment is $342 a month and I've never missed a payment. My interest rate is around 13.9%, which is ridiculous. I've tried to refinance and have been denied. I'm falling behind on my student loan, although it's nothing major. ($2800 remaining) Monthly payments are $50.

I no longer have a consistent source of income and am living back at home due to this. I've attempted to get back into work, but always seem to fall short. Interviews go well and they say they like me, but I don't hear back, or the position gets cut. This has happened about 6 times in the past year.

Just recently my car started having issues, and I am unable to afford to fix the car. I AM mechanically inclined so I could fix it myself, but I am unable to afford parts to fix it unless I sacrifice the little money I make to buy parts and in turn miss a car payment.

I'm wondering what I should do. I've asked family for advice, but don't get a solid answer. I'm alright with separating from the car as long as the loan goes with it. Unfortunately, I do not believe the car is at the value of the loan, so selling wouldn't really do much but cut the loan amount down.

personalfinance,My boss started paying me cash at a lower hourly rate without notice or providing pay stubs. What can I do?,"For the last 8 weeks, my boss has been paying me in cash. As a Bumper Straightener (I repair dents and dings on vintage metal bumpers and fenders of older model vehicles by hand) at a Chrome Shop in AZ, I was typically making $20 an hour. And I was payed with a check. So I have a pay stub, as you do, showing what goes to what taxes, state, federal, as well as social security, medicare, etc. But as of November, my boss started paying me cash, saying I had my taxes taken out before I was paid. 

Now, I don't know the exact percentage that Medicaid, fed, state taxes are taken out, so I took them at their word thinking  that this was temporary, and trusting my employer was paying my taxes before I was given cash in hand. But it is the end of December, and I have no proof that my income tax is being paid.

So I decided to confront my boss about it (Who has been very evasive about talking to me about my pay the last couple months). According to him, since November, he has lowered my pay from $20 an hour to $17.50. This is the first I've heard of this, but apparently, his excuse is ""Well you weren't here that day"" when he apparently announced this change to all the employees. I was so distraught that I only had the chance to ask one other colleague (of about 15 that work there) if they had their pay lowered and the answer was obvious; ""Fuck naw! if they did that shit to me, I'd be out of here!"" My assumption as of tonight is that they have done this to me and me only, without letting me know that they are;

 1. Lowering my pay and telling me two months after the fact
 2. Paying me under the table (and again not telling me until two months later)

When I asked why I was being paid $17.50 for the last two months, I got this response; ""That's what is typically left of your pay after taxes. I can't afford to pay $20/hr because the IRS froze my accounts! But if you want me to pay you $20/hr, you would have to do your own taxes!"" MOTHERFUCKER I DO HAVE TO DO MY OWN TAXES ANYWAYS, SINCE YOU STARTED PAYING ME $17.50/HR CASH WITHOUT ANY PAY STUB!! THAT MEANS THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE OLD PAY TO THE NEW IS JUST BEING POCKETED BY... BY WHO?? THE IRS? YOU??

..damn I wish I had said that but I was so shocked by his answer I didn't know what to do or say...

So I just want to ask the typical questions...

1. Is this legal?
2. If so/If not, what can I do next?
3. Have I already made a horrible mistake, and if so, what can I do to correct it?

TLDR; Boss started paying me cash a couple months ago, minus taxes, with no proof that those missing funds are going anywhere but his pocket. Also, it sounds like he may be in trouble with the IRS already. TIA!",finance,1482999883
personalfinance,Should I pay off my UK student loan or my NZ Mortgage,"Hey Personalfinance. Long time lurker, first time poster.

So my partner and I have a bit of spare cash and want to put it towards reducing some debt. Normally the rule is of course pay off the highest interest rate but we have a bit of a rare opportunity in the exchange rates.

I have a student loan in the UK (interest around 1.5%) and we have a mortgage on our house in New Zealand (break in fixed rates coming up, anticipate fixing around 4.5%). Easy choice right? But the thing is, post brexit GBP is at an all time low which presents an opportunity to dump a load of cash into GBP before it recovers. Conversely the NZD is pretty strong.

The money we want to invest with is in AUD so either way we have to pay conversion fees. Right now the exchange rate is £0.59 GBP for 1 AUD, by my calculations if it recovers to just £0.57 (it was £0.50 a year ago) then I'm better off paying off the student loan (assuming NZD stays flat).

Roth 401k: 60K
HSA: 7K
Roth IRA: 17K
401K options: pre-tax, roth, and after-tax

From reading this subreddit, it seems like I should be using a pre-tax 401K as well as a traditional ira instead of what I’m doing now.   From my understanding, the pre-tax 401K will lower my federal income tax and down the road I can convert it to a traditional ira when I retire.  

If I work till 50 at 40 and decide that the money I have in my 401K will be enough and decide to stop contributing I’m losing a large tax break correct?  Would you plan to always contribute to your 401K while working?  If my plan is to convert my 401K to an ira, can you use an ira to fund anything else like land or home purchases?  

Again, let’s say I retire at 50 and have $300,000 in my traditional ira. For the conversion, I convert $30,000/yr minus $5,500ira deduction and 4050 person exemption, I'm taxed at 15% marginal rate with $20,450 income? I have 60 days to put that $30,00 into a roth ira corect? What about dividends or capital gains?  Those aren't taxed if you're in the 15% bracket and thus could be used to live on?  So I could take $12,000 of gains to live on and put $18,000 into my roth ira and then withdraw that after age 59 tax free? In the conversion I wouldn't need to pay the 10% early withdraw since I'm rolling it within 60 days?

personalfinance,How will refinancing my student loans effect my plan to buy a house,"Long story short, my wife and I are planning to buy a house in the spring.  We have an adequate emergency fund.  We are gainfully employed.  We have an adequate down payment (not 20%, but we weighed the costs/benefits of buying without it).  Our credit scores are 745 (me), and 760 (her).  BUT, I have $91k in student loan debt.  For the last year, I have been on an income-based repayment plan.  I didn't really need to, but we did it so that we could aggressively save for the house.  In our area, home prices are still fairly depressed, but rising rapidly.  By no metric is it worth it to rent in my city unless your life/plans are not stable.  

This year, due to my wife taking a different job, we are no longer eligible for income based repayment on my loans.  My weighted average interest rate on those loans is almost 6%.  

My question to you is how will it effect my credit score and/or my ability to be approved for a mortgage if I refinance my loans privately?  

As far as I can tell, my monthly obligation will be slightly reduced from a debt-to-income ratio perspective.  It will, however, effect my average age of credit, which is currently only 9 years and the weakest element in my credit report.

I have a surgery upcoming after the New Year.

With my insurance provider I have a total Out of Pocket Costs of 6000 dollars. This surgery will most likely being me to that max. 

There are 3 different payees involved: anistesiology, facility, and physician. Each one wants a different amount paid up front equal to what they estimate my co-insurance to be. The problem is.. I am in school and do not make enough to cover the entirety of my portion of the bill up front. As far as I know, my alternative option is to take out a credit card known as, CareCredit. This would be an interest free card for a year; however 6000 over a year would be 500 dollars a month and would be a stretch to cover. If I miss a payment, the penalty is very high.

With this information in mind.. I could conceivably go part-time this semester and use my tuition refund to cover my surgery costs. My loans are federal at 4.9% and 6.3%.

personalfinance,Can you open an account with an online bank easily? Is this common?,"Dumb question time.  If a bank has better interest rates, can I just open an online account with them?  I set up a Vanguard account and that was pretty easy.  They verified me within a day.  If I wanted to open an account with a national bank with online services, can I do the same?  Is that fairly standard?  Everything done up to now has been finding a physical bank and meeting with someone in person.  But if I want to get a CD from a national bank and they've got better interest rates, that sounds better.  I checked a couple local banks, but their interest rates are pathetic.  Hundredths of a percent.  Ones I'm seeing online are more around 1.5%.  Why wouldn't I use those?

The only negative I could think of is that it's not supporting a local business, but I imagine they're doing the same thing -- Give me a lower interest rate, and then invest my money somewhere broader at a better rate.  Plus, some of my local banks are national and still have pathetic interest rates offered.  I don't feel too bad about skipping those.

I've refinanced the student loan debt many times and after the most recent locked in a 5-year fixed rate at 3.99% with SoFi. Not great to have such a short term (min payment 2.2k/mo) but can't stand the idea of losing money to interest (I have 4 years left).

I now have 93k in savings, a combination of savings my wife and I accrued over the years and a lump sum work payment. One part of me wants to just pay it all off and get rid of it, it's been such a burden, $$ wise that also would save me the most amount of money, risk wise that's probably not smart. Without student loan payments I've calculated my 3-month emergency fund to be $10,600.

Should we just pay it all off? Should we wait until we have (Student Loans + 10k)? Should we continue to make the minimum payment and invest some of the savings (this seems risky, but I do have a borderline 'low' interest rate for unsecured debt)? We'd really like to buy a house/apartment so we can stop throwing away money renting (this would be a much bigger saver than paying off debt early), should we save up for a down payment and go that route?

We were thinking about wiping out the three small loans totaling the $13,000 and moving it to the HELOC to get the interest rate cut in half and just adjust our home loan payment up a bit to compensate. Thoughts on this? Something i'm missing? We are at no risk of losing our house as it is a lean on our parents house (who have paid theirs off entirely and could bail us out if needed) and the minimum payment on the HELOC per month is $180 for just interest but that is all that's required if we hit hard times.

investing,2017 Portfolio,"Figured I'd post my picks for 2017 with a small snippet for each. My strategy is purchasing dividend aristocrat stocks from the big sectors and adding any value stocks of well established companies that have 3-4% dividend yields, along with several small and mid-cap growth stocks. I also buy industry leaders or companies with a lot of potential i.e TSN or HRL. My top 5 allocation percentages are Consumer Staples (19%), Industrials (16%), Financials (11%), Consumer Discretionary (11%), Technology (10%). Going long on all of these FYI.

Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome. I am fairly new to investing (3 months) but I have done my DD on all of these picks with their financials so I won't go in too much into the numbers aspect. I also prefer to purchase companies that I know about or use their products or services often, and that is reflected in a majority of these picks. 

**Materials**

Scotts Miracle Gro- Mid cap exposure, Bank of America upgraded it from ""hold"" to ""buy"" this month with a $105 target. It is in a very cyclical sector and most of their revenue will be made in the spring and summer months with their garden and lawn care products. Also a weed play I guess I'll throw that in there... 

Dow Chemical- One of the first stocks I purchased, one year price targets I've looking at have DOW as high as $72 and stock price is expected to grow at least 7% each of the next 5 years. Large market cap company providing services to many consumer markets and has a wide moat.

Huntsman Corp- Don't remember how I found this mid-cap stock but company reported $0.38 earnings per share for Q3 2016, topping estimates of $0.36 by $0.02. This company sells polyurethanes, performance products, and pigments for big companies such as BMW, Chevron and Proctor

**Consumer Discretionary**

Home Depot- Industry home supplies and improvement leader, more Americans are buying homes as well. Sales and profit are at record highs and same store sales are up 6%. In my opinion Home Depot is much better than it's competitors Lowe's and Menards. Since it is also dependent on the housing market 2017 should bode well for this retailer.

Walt Disney- Huge conglomerate, Star Wars is making them money, ESPN is not, but exploring options for cord cutters and I am optimistic they will do so

Shake Shack- Introduced breakfast menu along with mobile ordering app which is doing great and they just opened their 100th store this year with more to come in 2017. They only open stores in high foot traffic areas such as malls or city centers. For example, they will be opening up a Shack in the middle of Wrigleyville in 2019. Total revenue increased 40% in Q3 2016 with same store sales up 2.9%

Under Armour- Growth stock near year lows, high potential to eat into market share of Nike, Addidas. Has notable endorsements from Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Bryce Harper. They also have a deal with MLB starting in 2020 to supply all the uniforms. They have great athletic wear based on my experience.

**Financials**

Discover Financial Services- Great credit cards and customer service and since they are a bank as well they offer services such as saving accounts and student loans which many students use and something they will continue to push. It was between Discover and Visa for me and I think the former has more growth potential going forward.

CitiGroup- Big 4 bank which I think is undervalued by many. Will be one of beneficiaries of higher interest rates. 

SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF- Regional bank exposure, more people will be getting mortgages as rates keep rising and banks will make more money on higher interest rates

Bank of America- Bought in at $17, big bank, low P/E lot of cash on hand and will benefit the most out of the big 4 banks due to rising interest rates.

**Telecom**

Verizon Communications- Industry leader, many cell towers and coverage and will lead the charge into 5G networks

**Energy**

Chevron- Dividend Arisocrat, bullish price target set at $130

Exxon- Dividend Aristocrat, Tilleron as new SOS helps as well in helping negotiate with other countries knowing what would benefit the industry domestically and abroad

**Industry**

3M- Industry leader and dividend aristocrat, we use their products every day without even knowing it i.e. post its

Stanley Black and Decker- Great power tools and locks, mid-cap exposure, more home buying will result in increased demand for tools used for remodeling and construction.

Waste Management- People create garbage and someone needs to take it. Industry leader

CSX Corp- Railroad exposure. With Trump promising infrastructure improvements nothing is more cheaper and efficient to carry supplies and materials than by rail.

General Electric- Glad they sold off their financial unit, they can focus on what made them a huge conglomerate. Good price and portfolio must have in my opinion.

**Technology**

Microsoft- Entry into the cloud market will be big, their Surface computers are nothing to sneeze at either.

Intel- Great computer chips, always use them and they will be releasing new chips in 2017. AMD and NVDA do not scare this industry leader.

Activision Blizzard- Great yearly titles such as Call of Duty and WoW. Bit down this year but their entry into E-Sports will be big.

Cisco- Industry leader in office phones, communication equipment, reputable, good dividend.

**Consumer Staples**

PepsiCo- I picked this over Coca-Cola because there is better diversity within PepsiCo in their snacks business. People are also eating healthier which is why brands such as Tropicana and Quaker within the PepsiCo portfolio will give them that extra boost.

Kraft Heinz- Who doesn't love ketchup and cheese? This merger was helped by names such as Berkshire Hathaway &amp; 3G Capital. Buffet's largest holding as well.

Proctor &amp; Gamble Co- Heavyweight industry leader offering us products such as Bounty, Tide, and Crest toothpaste. People use their products every day. 

Tyson Foods- Purchased the dip, they are an industry leader and I am certain they will bounce back in the long-term.

Hormel Foods- Mid cap stock. Net profit has steadily increased last couple of years, their acquisition of Justin's LLC who specialize in nut snacks and SPAM maker Applegate will turn out to be a revenue producer in the coming years.

**Healthcare**

Johnson &amp; Johnson- Dividend Aristocrat around since 1886. They sell most of the household items we use every day such as Tylenol, band aids, and baby products. These guys are here to stay.

Pfizer- Great dividend stock to keep purchasing. Healthcare was a little beat up this year but with the Trump administration promising less drug regulations companies like PFE have the potential to grow their revenue moving forward.

**Utilities**

personalfinance,The State of New York says I owe them money?,"This is a tax question that I'm sure the obvious answer to is ""You have to pay,"" but really needed to bounce this off people because it's so agitating. I'm 27, male, I currently live in NJ. I file my taxes single with no dependents.

In 2015 I lived on Long Island and worked 2 jobs, both of which I filled out W2's for. It was my understanding that a W2 indicates taxes will be taken from your pay as you are paid whereas something like a W9 gives you all your earnings up front and you pay the taxman at the end of the year. 

I moved to NJ January 1 of 2016 and filled out my taxes with TurboTax (I do this every year with no issues). I get confirmations both State and Federal returns are accepted and I get my small tax return. A few months later (for reference we're in April-ish of 2016 now) I get a letter from the state of New York saying they did some calculations and I owe them money on my income taxes (roughly 70 bucks). I promptly blow this letter off and go about my life knowing with 100% certainty that I paid what I owe on the money I made already -- I had to have, the taxman took his cut before I ever got my checks.

I had totally forgot about this happening and had not been contacted since. A couple days ago it randomly popped into my mind that I might owe money somewhere, but I shook it off. Then today I get a letter from the state of New York saying that it would behoove me greatly to pay up what I owe them (plus penalties -- the total is 90 and some change now) before they have to take actions to get it.

Is this legal? If this is legal, it feels like extortion and why is it legal? Why am I now paying 100 dollars for the privilege to have made (and ALREADY PAID TAXES ON) a year's income in another state?

personalfinance,Suggestions/Alternatives wanted for getting short-term loan or 'convenience check' for very brief period,"Hi all - I hope I convey the situation properly and maybe some of you will have some ideas for me. Here goes... I work full-time. I am attending NYU part-time in a program for my Master's degree. My company will reimburse me for tuition after I have received and paid the semester bill (one course). The university only accepts payments by check/eCheck. I have enough money saved right now to cover the class (~$6000) and get reimbursed, but have a large amount of CC debt (~$35K). My situation is that I have to keep this amount of cash on hand to cover each course for the next several years, which is expensive when I would rather apply the $6k towards my debt now to pay off my higher interest card, etc.

I have several accounts with Chase (checking, savings, multiple CCs) so I went to them to ask for advice and they told me 1) they don't make personal loans, even for short-term (I explained that I seriously would need to borrow $6k for something like 3-4 weeks.) and 2) they won't provide me with 'convenience checks' which I guess regardless of balance transfers or not are just known as 'promotional offers' for 'balance transfers'. Ideally, I would just write a check from my credit line to the school, and make the payment against this card when I get reimbursed within 3-4 weeks.

I still have Federal student loans which I have been paying down on schedule from undergraduate school, and don't want to take more student loans out if possible (not sure if I am even eligible - I remember that I had maxed out disbursement from undergrad long ago.)

personalfinance,"Company asked for honest feedback on yearly review plan, not sure what to do","Hi r/pf 


I work for a small company and my bosses boss pulled my coworker and I aside to tell us about a new yearly review and compensation plan the company was putting in place. Up until now there was nothing structured so some people got raises and others didn't. He sent us the details and my coworker already voiced her opinion and we are going to talk tomorrow but I'm not sure what to say to him. 


The plan shakes out to everyone getting a yearly review with a 2%-5% raise. I did a bit of research and looked around and the boss even confimfed this after my coworker mention something. The average yearly raise is about 3%. A 5% raise roughly works out to an extra $1,600. My coworker and even boss agreed that it was seemingly low. Now here is where I come in. 


I also think that the overall total dollar amount is low but I also understand we could get up to 5% and if it's 2% above average can we really complain? We all started out low for an industry average and I was hoping to scale at a much faster rate than an extra $1,600 every year. Up until  he brought this up I was hoping for at least a $5-7k bump. Which now realise is a lot higher than I originally thought. 


So here are my thoughts. I've excelled very quickly at my position and was eyeing a potential chance for a promotion entry level &gt; junior at the year mark or a few months after that (some have received the title bump faster than others) and I have a very strong case to back it up. I essentially went from managing pro Bono clients to managing  20+ and being the only employee to specialize in a certain sector as well as being the only one to help  my boss with high value clients (most coworkers are managing collectively $20k value clients while I'm closer to $200k) my hopefully not coming off as cocky backstory brings me to my next point. 


I have no idea what to say to the boss. Should I ask him for more money and or shup up and be happy about 5%. I don't want to come off cocky but I want to be confident. I just don't know if I should tell him my 100% opinion or just be a yes man to potentially save face. Is this even the right time to bring it?


 My point is that 3-5% is great for a standard yearly raise for an average employee and I would be happy about that but I'm actually looking to move up and advance in the company (some are content in the same position for years)
 and I want to not only make that known but make sure I'm not passed over a huge potential increase if I'm lost in this new structure. 


I've been at the company for less than one year and I really don't want to hop jobs every few years to get a higher salary. I love my job but was hoping for an 8k bump not 1.5k. Best case scenario I imagined getting a bump (promotion) at a year and a half, but I feel like I may miss out if they start doing the structured yearly reviews if that makes sense.


Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1483069136

Long story long-  
I'm a senior in college, and finishing my degree is going to take about $8,400. My job will reimburse about 5k of this. About two years ago, I got it in my head that I wanted to graduate debt free. This meant getting a full time job, moving back in with mom and pop, and refusing to take out any loans. I've never had a credit card, and only recently started making car payments a few months ago after being told I only have ""baby credit.""  
My monthly take home income is about $2,000 and paying tuition and my other expenses come out to about $1,700, which doesn't leave me much to save.  

As I'm sure is the same with other 23 year olds still living at home, I'd really love to have my own place, and it looks like paying rent and a student loan payment would be less than continuing to pay for school myself. Taking out a loan would also help me to build my credit so I can hopefully buy a house in the next few years with a not-too-crazy interest rate.  

TL;DR Want to take out 4k in loans so I can move out of my mom's house and start building credit.

First format, receive an email on an iOS device that appears to be from yourself!

personalfinance,18-year-old college freshman facing financial home crisis.,"I have a family member who is 18 and just finished their first term as a freshman in engineering at a state university. They lived with me in an apartment in the area for this first term, but now I am moving out of state and they don't have that option anymore. They don't currently make enough money to live on their own (they have been looking for work for awhile without much luck yet), even after accounting for a maximum financial aid loan and a renewing scholarship. Our parents have such a low credit score that even if they agreed to, they can't really cosign on a loan or rent.

Now they are faced with having to move back home (which is in the area) but the situation is not good. Due to several issues including mental illness, financial issues, a lack of bedrooms, and essentially hoarding, home is nearly inhospitable right now. Between the environment and related anxiety issues, they have been fighting depression and almost dropped out of high school while living there previously. Our parents are trying to figure out a way to make it feasible at home, but due to the previously stated reasons, this is not a feasible solution for more than a very brief period of time.

The only realistic options we see now are for them to desperately look for more work and hope to earn enough to move back out on their own within a short time, take the legal route with petitioning for independence without a substantive income (which would require multiple parties testifying that our parents cannot be responsible for this person--very bad for family relations) and lift the federal loans ceiling, or try to petition for a pause on their degree and look for work while trying to manage at home. Rooming with other people to try to lower the cost is something that one of our parents forbids, so that would be problematic since they would still be dependent on while defying our parents.

personalfinance,Student loan forgiveness confusion... different stories from different people,"So here is the dilemma: I have a LOT of federal debt. I am trying to figure out how to do loan forgiveness for public service position. I have been doing income based repayments for a little over 2 years which I thought would be going towards the 120 payments I have to make in order to achieve loan forgiveness. 

In speaking with 2 of the representatives from two different servicers (Great Lakes and Navient) I was told the bulk of them are direct loans already and my payments are working towards that and I just need to submit the employer certification which will serve as the application for loan forgiveness. A small portion of them are not ""direct"" loans and would need to be consolidated into direct loan with weighted, fixed interest (could be higher?) and payments for this portion prior to consolidation would not count towards my 120 required payments. So when I went to consolidate those loans, I ended up calling somebody from the phone number for questions about consolidation because when it was calculating my payments it said i was ineligible for IBR (income based repayment) so I would have to chose another type that would found towards the end goal of forgiveness - even though i am currently enrolled in IBR. In speaking with her, she said I need to consolidate ALL of my loans and only those consolidated will be eligible for loan forgiveness and none of what I have paid so far will count towards my 120 payments and this is deemed the ""application"" for the loan forgiveness as there is a question that asks if that is your main goal during the process of consolidation. 

So now, I am thoroughly confused because I thought consolidating them was a bad idea, and Ive been told 3 different things from 3 different representatives. Its not a small chunk of funds here, a couple hundred thousand so I would really like to get it right. Do I need to consolidate ALL of my loans?",finance,1483103828

B.  Pay credit card with 0% APR until 2018.  I had my wisdom teeth taken out recently and have a $1,300.00 balance on this credit card for the procedure with a $10k line of credit.

I'm not sure how it ended up that way, but I'm curious if I should tell them or let it be a little bit of a grace period for myself. The total monthly payment for all of them would be ~$830.

personalfinance,Coming into a position where I may be able to pay off my student loans all at once. Is this a good idea?,"I graduated from college in May of 2015 with about 18.5k in student loan debt excluding accrued interest from unsubsidized loans. I paid off that interest first and then some, and have been making payments just higher than my minimum required amount since. I'm down to about $16.9k at the moment, spread across four loans at interest rates between 4.6%-6.8%. 

This past August I was also hired at my first full-time job after pursuing some part time positions for a year. Combined with my previous savings and the new steady stream of income I have saved up about $16.5k. (My family was terrible at budgeting growing up and it has always been extremely relieving to see the highest number possible in my bank account, however absurdly high it may be).

I'm not making a ton of money, but my expenses are relatively low aside from this debt. I make about $3k per month and about half goes to expenses, the other half is saved. That combined with my projected tax return should put me in a position to have about $23k in savings by April, conservatively. 

I have the following questions about my situation: 

1. Is paying them off in one lump sum a good idea in the first place? Should I be spreading it out over the year for reasons I haven't considered? The idea of being debt-free before the age of 23 is a very exciting concept but I want to make sure there aren't any downsides to this decision I haven't thought of. 

2. I know this will hurt my (excellent) credit score, and though it would be stupid to keep the debt around specifically for that reason I may need to look for a new apartment this coming year, and every landlord I've ever had has checked my credit. How much damage would I expect to see to my credit score if I do this? (The only other things on my credit report are 3 credit cards)

3. (Slightly less related) I've read the investing wiki and do plan to start saving for retirement as soon as I have the loans paid off, regardless of when that is.

personalfinance,Keeping account open to ruin credit score?,"Long story short--I was a stupid college kid and I signed up for an online line of credit, ran up a couple thousand in debt, paid some of it back and when I switched banks shortly after graduation, I forgot to update my payment info with the lender.

I'm an idiot and don't monitor my credit score that often, my credit card serves its purpose without having an insane credit limit.  I thought all was peachy until I tried to get a car loan and was surprised at the interest rate I was offered.  That's when the online lender from a few years back I'd completely forgot about reared its head.

That's where my question comes in--I'm not denying being delinquent, but at this point I wonder what their end game is.  The $1,500 of debt has ballooned to close to $5k because of interest and late fees and they seem to be happy to keep reporting the delinquency every month (now some 20 months later) instead of closing the account and selling the debt for pennies on the dollar to a collection agency.

I am in no position financially right now to snap my fingers and pay off the debt, and I have not received any response to emails I've sent to the lender.  At this point, I'd much rather have the derogatory tag of a closed account than see a record of serious delinquency (went from 100% on time payments to low 90's) all because of one account.

personalfinance,Wells Fargo closed my line of credit after I payed off the balance without notice or explaination.,"I'm going to try to keep this simple to keep it from turning into a wall of text. 

Basically I paid off $11,000 dollars in high interest revolving credit last month after receiving a windfall. 

My FICO score has floated between 740 and 690 until this year where it's hovered around 640 then a massive dip to 550 according to my profile on Wells Fargo even though my credit union pulled up 670 when they pulled up a score from transunion at the same time Wells Fargo was saying 550.

As soon as I paid off the debt on my line of credit (17% $5000 limit) they closed that account without notice or explaination. However they left my credit card (24% $1500) alone. 

When I called for an explanation it was obvious I wouldn't receive one to my satisfaction since the girl was just listing generic factors that could affect my credit that I know have nothing to do with me since also pulled a report from all three agencies using the link THEY PROVIDED to a free credit report. 

I was angry enough that I just went ahead and closed the super high interest credit card as well even though it's my longest standing credit card. The interest rate has always been super high on it and they never backed down from it even when my score was as high as 740.

My concerns are that there's something effecting my credit that I can see on a credit report but that's being used against me and that even though I've payed off the balances on these accounts it will take forever for my credit to recover. 

I've started a new job recently and I'm making about $10,000 more per year than I was but it was still difficult because with all the debt I racked up being underemployed I was making payments over $350 a month just to make the minimum payments

My father is over 65, so he is eligible for the higher standard deduction, but has itemized deductions that total much higher due to some seriously large medical costs and his property taxes.

2015: Federal AGI $50; Itemized Deduction ~$13,000 (I don't have the exact number but it's somewhere around there)

My question is; is it okay to have a negative number appear on the form, or is there a different way I should be reporting this? In both cases, when I subtract the deductions from the income, I get a negative number, which of course works out to 0 taxable income when I get to line 43, and he of course owes no tax.

personalfinance,Student Loans vs Saving for House,"Morning PF,
My wife and I have a combined 180k in student loans in both federal and private lenders. We currently have a combined income of 150k. Our aggregate interest rate for all of our loans is around 6.5 percent currently.


My first question is if we refinance with a private lender like SoFi, how low do the interest rates go, assuming both of our credit scores is &gt;750.


Second question is assuming we make regular payments, is there a difference between a 30 year loan and a 10 year loan, assuming I am able to pay $2000/month regardless of terms? As in, am I saving in interest if I pay off a 30 year loan at the same speed as a 10 year loan.


Should we save for a house first? We have 80k saved and are looking for a 500k house in 2-3 years. Assuming we can make a 20% down payment, would it make sense to make minimal payments on our student loans to save faster? If we move into a house faster, we can stop paying our 2000/month rent. We have established careers in a stable location.


Thanks for reading and happy new year.",finance,1483121242
personalfinance,"Tax questions: bought investment property, started an indie record label at loss, bought a home... manic, messy year.","Hi PF,

I am unsure where to start. I will probably consult a local CPA to sort all this out but I thought I would seek your advice, first. Basically it was a decent year financially, but also there was money flying everywhere and it was kind of crazy. I started two businesses and I don't know what I'm doing. [Unmarried, 27M]

**2016 Overview**:

**May 2016**: Bought investment property with portfolio loan, started renting on AirBnB. Sunk somewhere around $11,000 into down payment, overhead/utilities, supplies, and remodel. Made $4700 on rentals throughout the summer. Have not paid taxes on the rental income. Did not know how/where/who. Will AirBnB issue an end-of-year statement? Confused.

**Sep 2016**: Bought a house @$164,000, 20-year loan, 2400 square feet. Using one bedroom and whole basement for business, below...

**Sep 2016**: Started an LLC indie record label to sell music through. $1800 in expenses, including home-office set up, web, some marketing. Made $12.75 in revenue... got sick, had surgery, etc. at this time. Life happens. Paid cash for recording music videos with local vendor/friend, probably cannot claim this I understand. 

**W-2**: Make $77,000 at day job. Invested $12,000 in 401k. So I think 65,000 taxable wages. Have been paying into federal and state taxes all year through employer. 

**Stocks**: Sold a few shares of this and that at a loss, don't know how to account for this. Not sure what I bought them at. Ended up with ~$180 and closed out brokerage account with TDAmeritrade. I'm no good at trading. 

**Head of Household**: What does this mean? My S/O lives with me rent free and we have a cat and a chihuahua. Does this count for anything? :) 

**Medical Expenses**: Not even sure where to find a total or if this counts for anything. Probably spent $3000+ on co-pays, deductibles, prescriptions. Some non-covered prescriptions. Luckily I have great coverage and I feel fortunate that I don't have any outstanding medical bills from my back surgery. 

I think I have enough information in my spreadsheets to file this myself with TurboTax, but I don't know if this is a good idea for me. I'm afraid of doing something wrong. I have never owned businesses before, and suddenly this year I have two. One is not registered as any kind of entity, just doing it through AirBnB. One operated at a loss as an LLC and I think I filed all the paperwork correctly to set it up, but haven't paid any taxes or submitted anything for it. 

I don't have business bank accounts but was able to isolate my business expenses from my checking statement and credit card statements and pulled them into a spreadsheet to tabulate revenue/loss.

personalfinance,[Retirement] Order of Operations Question,"Hi PF! Long-time lurker and had a question (that I'm likely overthinking). So I finally got 6 months of emergency fund saved up and was looking for my next step. Per the order of operations in the sidebar, I should, in theory, be tackling any debt above 4-5% interest rate (since my job does not offer 401K match).

However, I'm not sure if this is necessarily true. Currently, my company does a profit sharing program in lieu of a 401K match. I don't have to contribute anything and every 6 months, my company will typically deposit anywhere from 10-12% of my annual salary (40K pre-tax) into a Vanguard 401K. This is really the only sort of retirement I have currently.

So what I was wondering is, what should be next? I have roughly 20K in student loans to pay, with one $1500 loan at 6.8% interest and the rest at 4.5% or lower (most are subsidized Stafford loans). My minimum payment is $275 but I've been paying $300 each month. Should I start paying extra to pay off the student loans or should I start working on a ROTH IRA? Seems like the rate of return on the IRA trumps my student loan interest.

TL;DR-Order of operations states I should pay off my student loans first but given my company's retirement plan coupled with my low student loan interest rate, it seems I would be better served moving on directly to the IRA.",finance,1483121513
personalfinance,Consolidating debt - is it a good idea?,"Hi PF!  Short and sweet background here:  I'm American, active-duty currently (about 2 years out from separating), single.  My credit score is so-so - I took a huge hit on my credit when I got divorced 3 years ago and I've been rebuilding since.

Right now my credit utilization is killing me.  Life happened about a year ago and I ended up having to max out my only credit card to take care of it.  I haven't been able to pay that credit card down though because of it's high interest rate.  That, my car, and a small personal loan are the only debt I have right now and I'd really like to eliminate the CC and the loan before I separate from the military.  I also really want to buy a house and although the VA loan is no down payment and generally more lenient on credit scores, I don't want to worry about being at the lower end of qualifying.

To give a clearer picture:
Car loan @ 0.9%, original loan amount was 25k, now ~14k
Credit card @ 18%, ~6200/6500 limit
Personal loan @ 12%, original loan amount was 10k, now ~4k

Both the CC and the loan are through NFCU and were opened after I joined so I can't use the Servicemember's Relief Act.  Car is through Ford and I have no idea how I got such an amazing interest rate but I'm not questioning it!

I was considering consolidating the CC and the loan.  A, I've heard consolidation often lowers your monthly payments (not that I'd be paying the minimum since I want it paid off quickly), and B, doing that would lower my credit utilization which would help immensely with my credit.  I will request a refinance on both of these (the CC I opened over 6 years ago and I had zero credit, so I'm positive I could get a better rate on that) but I'm not sure how much that will help.

Is this a good idea?  I know it's not a ton of debt but I've seen way too many friends get out of the military and struggle because they still lived at the same level they were at on active duty, including with their debts.  I'd also like to be able to sock away more money in my savings before separating so paying this off completely would be a huge help.

personalfinance,Student Debt and Getting Married,"Hello!

I've always found PF extremely helpful while managing my student debt (in fact, though it's been a slow process, I've cut down 10k of debt in 2 years on a salary of 30k. Thanks guys!).

Long story short, I will have $18,000 worth of subsidized debt when I get married in April. Here's the breakdown:
$2,500 at 4.5% 
$4,500 at 3.4%
$5,500 at 3.4%
$5,500 at 3.86%

I will be out of deferment and garnering interest on these loans starting in June 2017, two months after the wedding. I've cut back on aggressively throwing money at my loans now that all that remains are my subsidized ones -- currently, I put $200 a month towards my highest interest loan. I've been rebuilding my emergency fund and currently take home ~$2,000 a month after taxes in the meantime. 

Other expenses per month:
Rent = $492.50
Car = $300 (I purposefully overpay on this now that I am dealing with subsidized loans. Fixed interest of 2.2% on 11k)
Utilities = ~$100

My spouse has offered to completely pay off my debt the minute that it is no longer subsidized (and has the financial means to do so through a nice nest egg ~30k his parents saved for him). Surprisingly, I find myself waffling. I feel that this sum of money would be better off for its intended use in the future (a house) while I continue to chip away at my debt, especially because the interest rates are not too high. Additionally, though it is small, I do receive a tax return based on the money I spent on interest (if relevant, I live in CA). My monthly required payments will be around $180 when I leave deferment and I am planning on paying $300-400. I guess I should also mention that any money we will be getting at the wedding has also been offered to go to my student debt as well (though I have no way of knowing how much that might be so I have no plans on accounting for it at this time).

To be completely honest, I'm not sure how my taxes etc will change once I am married (though I am hopefully assuming I will be taking a bit more home each month). Reddit, what do? Should I take some of the egg and pay off my highest interest loan? Am I being silly and should get rid of it completely as soon as possible?

In August of this year, I began the fall semester of college. All of my expenses were paid by federal/state aid, along with a few other scholarships. I received around $1800 of refunds, and used ~$500 on books.

personalfinance,"22, earning 60k, found out my networth is -$24k today, wanting advise on where to allocate monthly surplus funds. To be or not to be risky?","Hi all! Recent grad, working full time engineer making 60k+bonus, after paying my income earning expenses I have about $1100 in surplus a month. I basically want advise on where to allocate about 2/3 of this money (say $800), I will use the other 1/3 for personal endeavors (travel, entertainment, etc). Below is what I have going in life:

1.  Contributing $200 a month toward HSA account (only using this temporarily while I pay my orthodontic fees)
1. Contributing $2k a year toward 401k (company match limit) (total at $5.5k)
1. Renting apartment 
1. 19k car loan, 3% interest rate
1. 21k federal student loans, ranging interest rates, all pretty low.
1. Checking account: ~6k
1. Savings account: ~2k 

Ultimately, I have a few questions about the surplus usage: 1) I'm only using 6% of income toward pretax accounts, should I increase that percentage? 2) Instead of increasing it should I open up a Roth IRA and start building that up? 3) Should I just put more money toward loans even though interest rates are decently low? 4) I really want to start investing in income producing assets, but I am still learning and not confident to start throwing money away. (my millennial-like thought process is having these assets pay for my loans or at least the incurred interest over the years).

My first mistake - I chose a very limited insurance, I'm young and fairly healthy and didn't think I would end up in the hospital. Went to the ER, dr advised me to see gynecologist. Saw my gyno who insisted I get surgery. It had to be done at a hospital she was contracted at, I went for pre-op testing, due to limited insurance that hospital wanted $9,000 down or $48,000 up front for surgery which I did not have and was turned down for surgery. I'm still walking around with a 6cm cyst. My bills are as follows after insurance:

I have already called each bill to ask for charity/financial assistance the only one that accepted charity was the ER bill and I was denied because apparently the Federal Poverty Charity guideline is $990/mo which doesn't make sense to me because even the Medicaid guideline is $1350 in my state. I'm obviously asking for charity because I'm overqualified for Medicaid. Will I HAVE to pay all of this? Can anyone give any insight or have suggestions?

Bitcoin,Why I believe the value of bitcoin will surge in 2017,"The USD has been doing great since the announced Trump presidency. This has allowed the federal reserve to hike the interest rate (December 14th). A large bitcoin investor from Shark Tank South Africa says the surge (~December 16th) was a direct response to the interest rate hike and increase of the USD devaluing foreign currencies. There are an estimated four interest rate hikes coming the next year.

Currencies are destabilizing as a direct correlation to political revolutions/globalization. There are elections in 2017 in France and Germany this next year and I personally believe that the value of their currencies in such divisive political times will drop inevitably since one side will be terrified of the outcome no matter the winner.

Venezuela airlines are now only accepting bitcoin. I see this trend growing since they literally weigh their money instead of counting it. 

Donald Trump's immigration policy. Now hear me out on this one. Between deporting criminals and strong border security especially, the traditional method of buying drugs straight from border cartels will become less common/possible. This will cause drug dealers to adapt to changing times, thus switching to dark markets.

Lastly,  bitflyer has been advertising bitcoin heavily in Japan both through commercials and newspaper ads.

Of course this all pure speculation and I could be completely wrong.",cryptocurrency,1483143560

I make 50k a year, but I have a terrible habit of paying things off a day late (not rent or utilities tough).

My wife and I planned on moving to a bigger home in the next 3 years but I'm a little spooked into acting now when mortgage rates are lower vs. waiting when rates will be higher. I feel like it will cost $$$ to wait since a mortgage will be more expensive in the future and the principal reduction on my current mortgage won't come close to offsetting an increase in rates.

I had to put pen to paper, intuitively an increase in the fed funds rate will lead to an increase in mortgage rates, right?? I had to do the math to make sure and now I'm a little confused. Correlation is about 0.92 but beta is 0.00. I understand there's a difference in short term money and 30yr money but I didn't expect this result and now I'm wondering if I'm overreacting.

personalfinance,34 yo military member with no retirement savings curious about where to start.,"Hi all, another one of these posts I guess... please bear with me.   
  
I am 34 and have been in the military for 15 years. A 20 year retirement looks like a definite *knock on wood* but that might net me $2.5k a month at most when that time comes (not bad I know).  
  
I have very minimal retirement savings (less than $2k in Roth TSP) but have recently come into a good work situation and have managed to up my Savings Account to $40k in the past year (up to possibly $50k by Apr 2017).  
  
I am looking for where to start now, and what to do with the 40K sitting in a crappy Wells Fargo saving account. I was debating moving to Navy Federal Money market Savings, which can earn up to 1% APR, which is a good start but I know there’s likely smarter ways to make that small nest egg work for me. I just need some suggestions and some advice to help me maximize my remaining few years of contributions/saving strength.   
  
Finances are below:   
  
Current Monthly  finances:   
+ $4175 - Base Pay   
+ $370 - Food allowance

- $260 FICA - SS

- $80 Car Insurance  
- $45 internet  
- $400 Food/Eating out/Coffee/Red Bull  
- $200 gas

- $1250 going into a savings account (28% of after tax income, this is a new trend, past 1-2 years?)  
- $3266 (Total amount of things I can control)  
  
The rest is kind of mad money (roughly 1K a month). I keep this because a) knowing my previous horrible saving skill, spending habits, etc I dont want to budget away all my money and end up not having a ""fallback"" amount in my checking account and b) I grew up with little/no money and I hate the feeling of not having enough to do osmething that makes me happy.   
  
I use this money for unexpected bills, the occasional splurge (Amazon!), or for entertainment not already set asside/calculated (Snowboarding stuff/video games/clothes).   
  
I have been debating adding an extra $250-500 to my ""Savings Account"" (or other applicable savings altrernative) as well.   
  
My credit score is at about 675 after a few years of battling bad decisions, a horrible ex-wife experience which includes a few repossessions (thanks ~~Obama~~ ex wife). I am working to get the final blemishes off my credit report (working to lower collections payments, and have them remove or mark past accounts as payed as agreed).

I moved out this week to avoid trying to move mid-semester and have about as ideal of a living situation as possible (extremely low rent and a very understanding landlord).

personalfinance,Type of investing account to have instead of another savings account,"PF, here is my situation:
26 years old started working two and a half years ago. Since then I have gotten to a networth of about 60k and currently make a smidge over 100k. I have around 12k in a 'emergency fund' which is an ally money market account with around .8% interest. I usually have another 2.5-5k in a checking account for paying of credit cards and rent. I have a 401k and a Roth IRA from vanguard totaling about 48k over the last two years. Ive maxed the Roth both years and the rest is in the 401k. When I started work a contributed way over what I needed for max company matching, and recently scaled it back. I have paid off a federal student loan and owe about 5k to family with no interest. Rent is around 1400 a month in a big city.

Upon recent discussion with a family member it was mentioned that I may have been contributing too much to retirement and not saving or investing in something that I could use for a new car or house in the future (nothing specific, just between now and retirement).

So should I scale my retirement contributions back and set more cash aside in the ally account, or should I open another investment account that would hopefully work harder for me than ally's interest. I figure the answer is going to be a vanguard mutual fund account? Both my 401k and TSP are lifetime funds for the 2050's. If I have an investment account that I could liquidate at anytime for say, buy a car, I assume I would want to be less aggressive than my lifetime funds correct? Would it be worth trying to decipher the hundreds of funds vanguard offers, or stick with a lifetime fund that is more conservative?
