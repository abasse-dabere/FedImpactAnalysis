My private loans from Sallie Mae are all completely different interest rates. I don’t know anything about how to pay these off or what I should do… my parents don’t really know how to help me. Can someone tell me the best way to get rid/pay down this debt?!

*edit to add: my dad has been paying off the interest on all the Sallie Mae loans and says he will continue to do so. I’m not sure how much difference it is making, to be honest.",finance,1643678381.0

I’m looking to do the same thing so that I can get rid of my 2020 Jetta and get into a atlas cross sport.

personalfinance,No Federal Tax Withheld,"Hello. I received my W2 from my employer today and saw that I paid exactly $0 in federal income tax for 2021. How screwed am I??

I totally understand that it is my fault for not checking my pay stubs thoroughly. 

I worked at another employer for the month of January. Federal taxes were withheld from those checks. I filled out a W-4 when I started employment at my new employer. State taxes and Medicare are being withheld. I don't understand how this can happen.

For reference, my salary is $55k per year at this employer. My previous salary was $72k per year. On the new W4 form, I selected married filing jointly and $6000 in qualifying children (3). We are a single income household.

The only thing I can think of beyond ""I'm screwed"" is that I did not earn enough money for them to deduct from my checks. In previous years, we've received back all of the money we have paid in for federal taxes. Is that possible?

My two 2022 checks thus far have had federal tax withholding, but it has been very low. I did receive a compensation bump to $60k for the year and two bonuses, $1k and $2k. I've not altered my W-4 for 2022, so the only change is my income.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1643682611.0

The problem is my student loans are my oldest accounts. The oldest one (and with the lowest interest rate) was opened in 2015. I got my first credit card in 2019, and I just traded in my car to get a new one at the end of 2021. I'm wanting to buy a house (with a mortgage loan) by the end of 2024. 

Question: should I save $1,000 on my oldest student loan and pay the minimum so my credit score doesn't take a hit? If I paid it off, then would my credit score recover by the end of 2024 assuming nothing major changes? I'm working with 700-750 right now, and I make a high 5-figure salary.",finance,1643684048.0

CryptoCurrency,Top Post today Discussing 99 percent of Crypto has no Utility. Here is One.,"So today there was a typical ""Bear Market"" 99 percent of crypto has no utility post. That's fine, I have no issue with this persons point of view. I did want to point out my favorite utility project in response. Why? I have no idea. I mainly just get mind blown at how many people DONT use real utility that's already available to help their dollars the FED is making worthless go farther. While also stacking crypto by buying things they would anyways.  Honestly I don't care if you use it, Just a shame more people don't know. PS...Stick around for the Money Shot!

Now I'm not here to talk Tokenomics since we already get plenty of that. If anything I guess I'm here to ""Shill"" the company, not the native token. First I will talk about the utility, then the Company itself. Key information in this post ""Inflation sucks ass, Stretch your dollar further."" So, without further adu(Think thats right) I present....

StormX.

A Crypto Cashback company.

https://preview.redd.it/kwft7a2yy4f81.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab7127de5b6236aa23193942c249ba493c25f105

I think we have all heard of cashback, its been around since the first time Margaret Allen visited Sears in 1904. Okay I made that up, but Cashback has been around forever. Quote me.

StormX is a Crypto Cashback company that has partnered with over 1000 stores in 187+ countries.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jgx3lpavy4f81.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f53866e59ae250db9218fca8235ce4510311738

How to use it? Well all you have to do is follow 5 easy steps.

1. Download either IOS/Android app or the Google Chrome Extension
2. Pick an available store you want to shop at. (StormX provides a well designed list of available stores I.e Nike, Groupon, Ebay, Sonic, Jimmy Johns, etc.)
3. Once you have a store you like just click ""Activate Crypto Cashback!""
4. Shop how you would normally through that companies website, and receive Crypto Cashback based upon that stores percentage. (3% on Nike, 10% Groupon, 4% Old Navy, 9% SHEIN, etc.)
5. Receive your cashback rewards in BTC, LTC, ETH, DAI, or their native token STMX.

Its literally THAT SIMPLE!

You don't have to own the native token to use the app, you will want to but that's irrelevant. You can start shopping and stacking crypto cashback immediately.

People are making bank through this service, don't believe me? This is the current leaderboard.

Why waste money? I personally have made my fair share through purchases and Staking available on the App. Im a gold member so I earn Double percentages on my rewards. This total balance is just what I have waiting to be withdrawn. Oh yea, I almost forgot to mention the best part! NO Fees for withdrawing to your wallet! None, Zip, NADA! StormX owns a patent that allows for sending Crypto Payments, This allows users to withdraw for free!

Seriously, Why would you not use this for your Ecommerce?

A little bit about StormX now. StormX has been around through bear and bull markets alike. Recent accolades are that they entered a 5 year jersey sponsorship with the Portland Trailblazers, Partnered with PokerGO, and are hosting their first StormX Crypto and Celebrity Poker Invitational in Vegas. Attendees include Crypto CEOS, influential people in crypto, Celebrities' including Chum Lee, Bruce Buffer, Landon Cassill, NBA players, along with Poker Pros including Tom Dwan,  Phil Hemuth, Maria Ho, and the list goes on and on.

StormX is also close to releasing a Debit card that will convert STMX to Fiat at POS. That will reward users up to 15% back including up to 8% at AMAZON!

They are also about to release a Governance Token that will allow its user to have a real impact on the future direction of the company.

Like I said, I'm here to talk about the company StormX and the real world utility it can provide everyday shoppers.

If putting money you worked for back into your pocket does not interest you then that's fine.

TDLR; StormX is a crypto company that provides real utility to everyday shoppers. Crypto Cashback on things you would buy anyway! Screw the FED. Stretch your dollars further.

CryptoCurrency,Executive Order on Crypto Will Be Good,"Contrary to popular opinion and the media fud, the executive order from the Biden administration will be GOOD for crypto. This is the official acknowledgment from the powers that be that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and a force to be reckoned with. The executive order will task federal agencies with analyzing digital assets and assembling a regulatory framework that covers cryptocurrencies. Regulation will bring much needed stability to this space.

solar,Question about the Panasonic warranty,"I’m getting ready to get solar as soon as I can. There are some many choices out there and this community is a wealth of knowledge. 

I’m looking at getting a system installed in San Diego. One of the smaller dealers gave me a quote on a Panasonic system and included this excerpt as well:

Our warranty is backed by this multi billion dollar company. With other companies, if they go out of business, you will be responsible for finding a new installer and paying them to come out and fix your solar panels. With us, Panasonic will cover the labor and product warranty of the solar panels for 25 years no matter where we are.

We also stock the New Panasonic E Series AC Panels which comes with Triple Guard Warranty (Labor, Product, Power Production) on Solar Panels and Micro Inverters Backed by Panasonic. This Warranty is only from Authorized Installers of Panasonic Panels.

The price is 2.45 per watt installed before the fed incentives for a 6.66 kHw system with 18 panels and inverters. 

The panels are the Panasonic EverVolt WBS EVPV370 WBS with the Enphase Energy IQ7PLUS IQ7PLUS-72-x-US-240.

My question is about the warranty. If I went with this package and the installer went out of business would everything be covered by Panasonic including the labor? Would the inverters be covered in this case as well?

Thanks in advance for your help.",energy,1643688723.0
CryptoCurrency,Market speculation and L1 profit potential after market correction,"Hello everyone. If your net worth has decreased like mine has in the last week or so; keep in mind this crash for crypto was worse than the 2008 market crashes and even that bounced back. 😊

That being said I recently did more math and want you guys to check my numbers. Currently invested between NEAR, Terra, SOL and DOT; most of my holdings are NEAR and that is what I want advice on.

Here is what I am considering: the Fed increasing interest rates and opening an inquiry into cypto, the DOW in the last 2 weeks, inflation rates increasing worldwide – long story short this correction smells maybe half over.

I am primarily NEAR heavy, but appreciate Terra too, because I think it they have the best scalability and do historically well in BTC and ETH downswings. When the cowards flee for the hills, I reup. Drew my support lines at $10.5, $8 and $6.5. I’m still confident with them, what do you guys think? Guessing the bottom is impossible, but I’ll be damned if I can’t try.

56. Seabug has dropped a new medium article on their protocol for self-governed NFTs. This may turn out to be somewhat controversial to some since it may be seen as diminishing the unimpinged bearer bond like status of a crypto token issued under the protocol in exchange for theft protection. Many will like that. Some will not. Mlabs is mentioning a late February release for the actual NFT marketplace.

81. Looks like no SudaeSwap rewards today and no calculator yet (as of writing on Jan. 25). But, there is a calculator coming and the rewards will now be via DripDropz. Discord reports are that the rewards calculator should be in the next day or two. This is probably a big improvement for anyone staking via yoroi. They will also be adding various stats to the pools including queue depth. [https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1486030734267764747](https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1486030734267764747)

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin is King,"Fidelity Explains Why We Live In a Bitcoin-First World, Plain &amp; Simple

￼ by Eduardo Próspero

 2 hours ago

SPOILER ALERT: Asset Manager Fidelity thinks “bitcoin should be considered first and separate from all other digital assets that have come after it.” This is huge, considering the Fidelity Digital Assets division’s website opens with “We envision a future where all types of assets are issued natively on blockchains or represented in tokenized format.” That multichain-focused company recognized Bitcoin’s inherent superiority in their latest report.

According to Fidelity, “Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good” and not as a technology. This is key. They also “believe it is highly unlikely for bitcoin to be replaced by an “improved” digital asset for several reasons.” The rest of the document, more or less, consists of stating and analyzing those reasons.
The Fidelity report is exactly what Paul Krugman needs to understand the difference between Bitcoin and the rest of crypto. It starts with a fairly basic and non-technical overview of how the Bitcoin network works. It explains its “enforceable scarcity,” and how Bitcoin’s “monetary network effects” are unbeatable. It goes as far as claiming that “any subsequent monetary good would be “reinventing the wheel.”
It explains classic Bitcoin-related concepts like “The blockchain trilemma” and its trade-offs. It goes into “The Lindy Effect, also known as Lindy’s Law, is a theory that the longer some non-perishable thing survives, the more likely it is to survive in the future.” And more, much more.

How Did Fidelity Arrive At A Bitcoin-First Stance?

This paragraph summarizes the report’s main thesis:

“Investors should hold two distinctly separate frameworks for considering investment in this digital asset ecosystem. The first framework examines the inclusion of bitcoin as an emerging monetary good, and the second considers the addition of other digital assets that exhibit venture capital-like properties.”

A question arises, why does Fidelity consider Bitcoin a monetary good in the first place? They list four reasons:

A monetary good is something that has value attributed to it above and beyond its utility or consumption value. Although Bitcoin’s payment network certainly has utility value, people are also ascribing a monetary premium value to the bitcoin tokens.

One of the primary reasons investors attribute value to bitcoin is its scarcity. Its fixed supply is the reason it has the ability to be a store of value. 

Bitcoin’s scarcity is underpinned by its decentralization and censorship-resistant characteristics. 

These characteristics are hardcoded into bitcoin and almost certainly will never be changed because the same people that ascribe value to bitcoin and own it have no incentive to do so. In fact, network participants are incentivized to defend these very characteristics of a scarce asset and an immutable ledger. 

Risks And Possible Scenarios

The report doesn’t go deep into any subject, but it’s comprehensive. Fidelity covers the blocksize war and even does an Ethereum case study. They say ETH’s monetary policy “has changed and is expected to change again.” The report considers two possible scenarios;  “A multi-chain world” and “A winner-take-all or most world.” In both of those, Bitcoin is perfectly positioned to dominate. 
On the risks side, they consider a few, but they make clear that they plague every digital asset. Fidelity considers “Protocol Bugs,” “Nation-State Attacks,” “Growth of the Digital Asset Ecosystem,” and “Potential Instability of Traditional Macro Conditions.” In the end, Fidelity concludes: 

“Bitcoin’s proof of work algorithm, governance structure, and fair launch created the grounds for a decentralized project with minimal trust required. Other tokens have alternative consensus mechanisms, governance structures and token launches, which often reduce their level of decentralization.”

Fidelity ‘s Actual Conclusion

We have to reproduce the report’s last paragraph, the actual conclusion, in its entirety:

“Traditional investors typically apply a technology investing framework to bitcoin, leading to the conclusion bitcoin as a first-mover technology will easily be supplanted by a superior one or have lower returns. However, as we have argued here, bitcoin’s first technological breakthrough was not as a superior payment technology but as a superior form of money. As a monetary good, bitcoin is unique. Therefore, not only do we believe investors should consider bitcoin first in order to understand digital assets, but that bitcoin should be considered first and separate from all other digital assets that have come after it.”

personalfinance,Should I cash out my 401k or roll it over to my new job?,"Hello everyone. As the title states, I got a new job and my old job gave me an option of rolling over my 401k to my new job or cash it out. It’s about $4200. If I roll it, I don’t lose anything, but if I cash it out, I lose 20% for federal withholdings and then an additional 10% for something I forgot the reason for. It’s a total of 30% from the 4200, leaving me with $2940. 

The reason why I’m asking is because my friend told me to invest any money I have in crypto. I’m skeptical but the way he made it seem was like it was the next bitcoin (Solana). Also I am tight on cash since switching jobs (because of how each company’s pay periods work). 

I’m torn at the moment and I have until February 28th to make a decision. Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1643716259.0
personalfinance,Preparing financially to sell one house and buy another,"In 2019 I purchased a home for $280k, with a current Zestimate of around $360k (thank you housing market). The outstanding balance on the mortgage is around $187k, at 2.99%.

In a bit over a year (around Spring 2023), I want to move to a larger home. At \*current\* prices and location, that means around $450k, though with fed rate hikes throughout 2022, that might go down somewhat.

My thinking has been to stock away as much cash as possible to be in a position to make an offer a new house that's \*not\* contingent on selling my current house—my financials should allow a lender to approve this, and a fast, pre-approved offer without contingencies or Hubbard Clause would be attractive to a seller. I'm assuming that any market fluctuations will be cancelled out between the purchase value of a new home and the sale value of the old home, and if rates do go up, then having that cash available to make a larger downpayment allows my mortgage principal to be lower.

**The actual question:** Is there a financial advantage I'm missing to paying off the current mortgage sooner instead? Particularly if I'm selling in about 15 months, there doesn't seem to be an advantage to paying down a 2.99% loan any quicker. Is my thinking on market changes cancelling each other out between buy/sell flawed in some manner?

# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Check your percentages!**  There are two different challenges this month depending on your position in the [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) list of steps.

1. **If you're on steps 0 through 3, do the first challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Building an emergency fund
  - Paying down expensive debt (interest rate over 10%)

2. **If you're on steps 4 through 6, do the second challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Saving for retirement
  - Investing for other long-term goals

3. **If you're not sure which challenge applies best to you (e.g., not saving for retirement yet, but don't have credit card debt), feel free to pick and choose from either challenge.**

4. **Bonus points: do both challenges!**

# First challenge

Your challenge is to pursue improving your interest rates.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the following things:

* If you have debts, compile information on each debt including the type of debt, the amount owed, and the interest rate. Also [find out your credit score and review your credit report.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%2830-day+challenge+get+on+top+of+your+credit%29&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=year#res-hide-options)
* If you have credit card debt that you are carrying from month-to-month, [call up your credit card company and make a request to lower your interest rate](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/how-to-lower-credit-card-interest-rate/).
* If you have enough money in your checking account to cover *at least* one month of expenses, start building a second tier to your emergency fund by opening a savings account and deposit $50 or more into it.
* If you already have a savings account, [research your options](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/rates/) and consider moving your savings account to a bank paying a higher rate.  (The wiki has some [common recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).)

# Second challenge

Your challenge is to audit your investment expenses and emergency fund.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:

* Request a fee schedule/statement from your financial advisor (if you have one).
* Request a fee schedule/statement from the administrator of your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan (or find out your fees by logging into your plan account).
* Look through recent statements to see if there are any charges you don't recognize.
* Calculate your [blended expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios#Blended_expense_ratio).
* Evaluate your emergency fund and adjust it accordingly if your expenses and/or risk tolerance have changed. If you raised it, make a plan to meet your new e-fund goal sometime in the future.

The idea here is that you might uncover some expenses you didn't know you were paying, which in turn might give you a reason to make a change for the better. The impact of [costs on investments can be depressing](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost). If you find a clean slate, sleep well knowing that your money is working for you first and your investment company second. Another way to sleep well is to ensure you have enough set aside for emergencies. You may have set up your emergency fund goal and met it a number of years ago and perhaps times have changed for you. It's a great time to ensure you have an appropriate amount set aside for your expenses and risk tolerance.

personalfinance,Buying out my car lease. Seeking help.,"Hi all! Hope this is the best sub for this discussion. Here is the deal:

I am about to finish year 3 of a 4 year car lease. I live in Florida. My leasing company is Ally. 

I am interested in buying my car out of my lease ASAP. 

Why? 

Because I would be financing the buyout and if I wait till the end of the lease, interest rates will likely go up. 

Because leasing or buying a new car would be based on current prices which are inflated. 

Because the residual value of the car would be under the market value, so I could keep it or even sell it in the future if I wanted to. 

Because I think my monthly payment would go down and it would help with budgeting. 

Here's the situation:

1. I called ALLY and they told me that in Florida they are not allowed to sell me the car directly and that I have to do business with a dealer (any dealer). 

2. A friend of mine who also lives and leased in Florida bought his lease (with a different leasing company) and claims he didn't have to speak with a dealer and even did everything over the phone. 

What are my options?  
Is it true that I must go to a dealer? If yes, does it make a difference which dealer?
Any other suggestions?

Forex,ICT's Video Review Roast &amp; The Market Algorithm,"ICT Video Review file  ""ICT Forex Price Action Lesson: Advanced IPDA Insights.""  


After being informed of the trader ITC claiming to use algorithms I thought I'd peek in and take a look see what cards he's revealing. This is a brutal drive by assessment of trader ITC's techniques and methods. What is ICT about and is he using algorithms? Lets dive in and find out.  
I see ICT range trading. I see a lot of speculation on why moves happened. He's breakout trading and speculating on reasons. He's identifying ranges and break out opportunities. I think he's probably used over bought over sold indicator in the past but maybe he don't need it now. He's using candle formations to identify resistance zones. 

  
He seems a bit giddy about ""An hourly candle signature"" at the top of the range ""it's a rejection block.""  He says we ""won't know how to use it unless,"" he shows us ahead of time how it plugs into the ranges he's identified? ""It's a new animal a new gimmick but nobody else knows about this stuff but me."" I see a 1 hour pin bar candle at the top of his identified range. He called it a rejection block He says others won't know?  
    
So he's got the 1 hour rejection candle and experience to know markets bear down on Tues. He's committed to sell position based on general market sentiment, ranges, the day Tuesday and a 4th thing we'll get to soon.    
Lots of speculation on what the algorithm and interbank traders will do where their orders and stops are. Attaching ideas to chart moves. What came first the market drop, the algorithm giving a decline or the trader sentiment?  
""I teach how to trade break of market structure."" Again his best game seems to be break out / range trading.     
    
'The Fair Value Gap', he discovered it he owns it. ""if you understand this principle you'll never need to work hard again for your money."" What is a fair value gap? When a market delivers on the downside a candle moves down and there's a gap between previous candles low and the next candles high this leaves a gap. The market will go back up and re test the low of the first candle for price efficiency and becomes a balanced price range. The same works in up and down scenarios. So he's identifying areas for retrace back tests of broken levels.  


He points out another Fair Value Gap but this one doesn't fill in all the way and he says we should have known to short it but it never made it to the level he indicated in the first example. But we should have known to trade at the shorter not completed retrace to first candle he tells.   
 

He gives a nice description of FOMC news price action. ""Clearing stops above and below previous range.""      
  

Why 1.1740 was his ultimate target for all this? Because at the very beginning of the bull run there's 3 candles that appeared at the bottom of a down run. The high of the first candle to the low of the third candle there is a 1 to 2 pip gap and the middle candle joins the two price areas that has not yet filled in by 1 or 2 pips. But we've just seen in the 2nd example how retrace price doesn't always completely fill in the gap, but we're suppose to know this time that it will give him the overall target?     
  

On the 4 hour chart the last down close candle before the bull run it's high was 17413. He's saying he knew price was going to go back there and he rounded the target to the nearest 10.    
    
    
He knows a lot of clues in the market that he's collected over 30 years study. He takes simple basic trading techniques and combines them for maximum effect. First I thought he's getting to excited about simple trading techniques like candles, gaps, ranges, breakout stuff. All seems like basic things but they are so effective and when you put them in an overall framework (what he's calling algorithm?) with it's many elements he calls macros you can build a powerful framework of ideas. So you've got something to measure moves against those ideas. Even if your plan is wrong having a wrong plan in place makes a framework which will let you know when things are going wrong. Simple but powerful little things that you gain over a career in trading.   


He's obviously good at these things: range trading, over bought over sold signals, rejection candle formations, over all dollar bullish sentiment, knows when the market likes to move,  He's always on the look out for broken level to be tested.  


Things he speculates on: Market manipulation and how to take advantage of it, where orders are where stops are Interbank trader sentiment Algorithm behaviour  


This is a summary of what I've learned about ICT in only 1 40 min video, he must know a ton of other stuff he's gained in 30 years of trading. I'm probably gonna check out more of his videos for tips and tricks.  


He's not using rocket science as far as I can tell so far, he keeps it to basic signals on the chart. He strives to trade on bare charts, I have to commend that. You just don't need lagged indicators clogging up the screen. I havn't used it for a decade but I was a big fan of the 123 method using 'Trend Signal' indicator and ADX MA cross over. You can combine few indicators to form a solid system like 123 method to get you into trades and stay profitable. In the right combination with the right systems they can be used to great effect. So they're are not to be rejected lightly.   


THE ROCKET SCIENCE   
The actual market algorithm is 1231425364567. This arrangement creates a vortex linking all waves in sequence through every degree in every time frame. ICT knows there's a hidden force at work here. He's putting in maximum effort to try to reason with it's logic.",finance,1643721812.0

Microsoft declined to comment about the review. The FTC didn’t respond to a message seeking comment.

The Activision investigation will focus on the combination of Activision’s gaming portfolio with Microsoft’s consoles and hardware systems. Regulators are likely to look closely at how Microsoft’s ownership of Activision could harm rivals by limiting their access to the company’s biggest games.

personalfinance,Taking a 401k loan (~4%) to pay off student loans (~4%),"Please be gentle, I am not a wise nor seasoned investor. I'm a working salesperson. Last year I took home about $160k after taxes. I maxed out my 401k contribution, my HSA, and some education accounts so I believe I am following the proper play. 

I have no credit card debt but I do have a few cards that I use for cash back/points. We have a small nest egg around $60k in cash. Last year was my first year in sales and prior to that my income was around $80k. 

Basically my question is to know if it would make sense to take out a 401k loan with a percentage around 4% to pay off my student loans which total around $20k and have varying interest rates between 3.75% and 4.5%.

My understanding is that I could potentially miss out on market gains on the $20k loan but I would pay everything back and get the 4% interest in my 401k back anyway. Since the market has been choppy and it looks like we might continue to see a short term market downturn, I feel like it could be an opportune time to do the 401k loan.

If I did, I would still have around $40k in the 401k. 

Since there is still a moratorium on student loans does it make sense to just pay off my student loan while interest isn't accruing, using the money in my 401k? I think I would rather keep out nest egg liquid than dip into that.

cybersecurity,Grading the Biden Administration on Cybersecurity,"Hi everyone,

As global tensions continue to heat up, I've been thinking about how the federal government has been responding from a cyber warfare angle. Surely, many of their efforts are hidden from the public, but at the end of the day the private sector will be the front line if any full-scale cyber attack is launched against the US.

Early in his presidency, Pres Biden has made cybersecurity a key priority, although judging by the results in 2021, there hasn't been much headway. The head of CISA, Jen Easterly, seems to be doing a great job, but it's rather hard to judge from press releases and interviews.

CryptoCurrency,How to gain a guaranteed 15% - 40% ROI on your money. This is financial advice.,"Pay off high interest debt. That's it.

Particularly credit card debt and personal loans can have absurd interest rates easily amounting 15-40% if not higher. If you're unfortunate enough to of gotten in the whole at some point and haven't climbed back out yet, you probably shouldn't be DCAing crypto or stocks or bonds.

Paying off a credit card debt with 40% interest is THE EXACT SAME thing as making a 40% profit.

Im just some guy so what I say isn't gospel by any means, but I would suggest any debt you have above a 5% interest rate, you should pay off as fast as you possibly can and avoid extra debt like the plague where possible.

A mortgage loan isn't great either, being debt free is one of the best feelings in the world, but being a homeowner is another, taking out a 2.5 - 5% mortgage is probably worthwhile for most people. 

Ideally you should get a locked rate 15-30 year loan, but that isn't always available depending on your local area and financial situation. 

At 2.5 - 5 % you will even in some cases be making a profit after inflation which is crazy to think. 

Ideally you should probably still pay it off as early as possible, but it is fair to say that your money will probably do better elsewhere such as in the stock market with an average 8% annual return since like the 1920s, or maybe even in BTC if you want a little more risk and it would probably be somewhat reasonable to target a 20% annual return with that.

personalfinance,"First time homebuyer,- down payment or student loans?","So, first time home buyer here. Currently a medical resident in my final year of residency, with $100,000 in cash saved. Will be earning \~$250,000/yr. The options that I see here are with $300,000 in student loans (med school):

1. Conventional mortgage, $100,000 downpayment on a $400,000 (max) home. No PMI. Equity in the home (does that even matter?)
2. Physician mortgage, no downpayment, \~0.5% increase in interest rate (compared to conventional), no PMI. No equity in home. $100,000 to student loans
3. Physician mortgage, no downpayment, \~0.5% increase in interest rate (compared to conventional), no PMI. No equity in home. $100,000 to investments

We plan on being in this home long term. Plan on paying off the student loans in 5 years at an interest rate of 6% (? not sure off the top of my head, all federal loans).

personalfinance,Overpayment after leaving company,"Hi guys, here’s the situation. 
I live and work in SC. 
My last day with this company was 11/26. I was “hourly-salary” - so basically I was guaranteed a minimum amount of pay per week, but was paid an hourly rate for anything over the minimum requirement. 
I noticed a few weeks later that I was still receiving direct deposits from them, so I set the money aside and let them know. 
It took another couple of weeks to get worked out and my last payment from them was 1/6/22. In total, ~$6600 was direct deposited. 

Over this weekend, I received my W2 from them and a little letter stating that I owe ~$8500 to my surprise. 
I called and they said originally I owed $9375, but they were able to get social security withholdings back, so now I owe the $8500 to cover the net+state and federal taxes. 

Obviously, I’m annoyed. That’s basically $2k that I have never seen and they expect me to pay back. 

So questions: legally, what am I obligated to pay back? If I pay back the $8500, when would I see that $2k if at all? Could I just pay back the $6600 and get a corrected W2?

vet,is it time? what causes this,"hey I have a 14 y/o cat that's been diagnosed with kidney failure 1+ months ago. When she got diagnosed she looked awfully bad, didn't have balance at all, didn't eat or drink and didn't walk at all. I thought once we get to the vet she'll die on the spot (maybe me being very panicky) and she was left there for a few days connected to infusion in hope she'll fight it through. And she did, she got so much better since with close care. Now she again sort of coming back to that, but I'm not sure if it's old age, maybe dental depression (vet saw she had a problem there, and a few days ago I fed her and she sort of tried to move something in her mouth with a paw and each time stumbled down like in pain), or she's back to her kidney symptoms.

It didn't come back all of a sudden, but slowly ate less and could feel her losing balance, eventually turning worse. Now she's not eating except very rarely her wet food, and constantly licking her lips even though I water her a lot. Didn't even go to the bathroom but peed herself. Barely moving or responding..

personalfinance,"Vanguard Roth IRA - Buying Vanguard ETFs, credits and debits questions","Hello,

I just bought 3 shares of VOO in my Roth IRA account this morning and noticed that I was able to do so without transferring money from my bank. I then saw under the section \*Total credits and debits\* that the balance was approximately -$1200 signifying what I believe as $1200 in debits. I then contributed that amount of money from my bank account to my \*Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund\* to pay for my debits. So my questions are:

How much money can you take out on credit to invest with Vanguard?

What are the negative and positive aspects of investing with credit from Vanguard?

Is there any way to streamline buying Vanguard ETFs without contributed to Vanguard's Federal Money Market Fund then buying the ETF, where you can just have Vanguard take the money out of your bank to buy the Fund immediately?

Any answers to these questions would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",finance,1643731720.0
personalfinance,Short term strategy for my RRSP investments,"Hi all, 27M who is in his final semester of a 4.5 year electrical engineering degree (I'm mentally hanging on by a thread, haha).

In Canada, we can use an RRSP to fund the purchase of a home, this purchase will happen some time in the summer or the fall of this year. I liquidated all my RRSP positions in early December 2021 which actually turned out to be a pretty sound move. That being said, that money is not currently creating any wealth.

My question is basically, what are some safe options for short term investments in an RRSP account ? Not looking for anything that would make record breaking profits. Simply looking for solutions I could put my RRSP investments on for around 6 months to create a bit of wealth.

Bonus question, what are your thoughts about rolling student loans into a mortgage? Not necessarily something I'm considering at this time, just a thought, my current position on this subject is that it probably isn't such a good idea considering that most my student loans have fairly low interest rates (3.5%).

CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA+ Experiment - Week 15 Update,"It's that time again (albeit a couple of days late yet again). It's time for the weekly update to my DCA project and I think this is an interesting one. We're entering February on a bit of an upswing. The Fed news seemed to be no worse than the market had already priced in and I'm honestly slightly optimistic about February. I think we could see some modest gains this month.

Let's start by setting the stage. For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix  of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi)  as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the community  to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my own  research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some DD. I  have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous posts  and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be chosen by  the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end of the  experiment. For the starting point you can look here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3 and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sbyo5q/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_14_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

For those of you who have been following this, you may have noticed that as of last week I started calling it a DCA+ experiment. I felt this was necessary because twice I have ""bought the dip"" where I purchased all 19 coins in the project in the midst of a dip in addition to my normal DCA buys. At a quick glance those dip buys have not fared well over time, but I have established more formal rules going forward and I am currently planning a dip buy the next time BTC dips by $10k. The current threshold was tripped at $40k, so if BTC hits $30k I will commit to another one-time buy of $25 of everything in the project. If BTC continues to rise, that limit will rise with it like a stop loss order that I will manually place.

I mentioned at the top that I think this is an interesting update. What I found really interesting in this week's update is the fact that the two coins which had been my best performers over the course of the experiment (ATOM and LUNA) were by far the worst performers over the past week, down 19.2% and 21.3% respectively and the coin that had been my worst performer (TRAC) had by far the best week of the coins in the project and is up 32.7% since this time last week. Other than ATOM and LUNA, FTM is the only other coin in the project that is down over the past week and the big dogs, BTC and ETH are up 5.6% and 13.9% respectively so while the experiment is still down a fair amount, I'm in better overall shape this week than I was last week.

Due to the dip in ATOM, there were a few times when I had checked the portfolio over the last week and BUSD was the only coin in the experiment in positive territory. This marked the first time since I started the experiment that BUSD was in first place, although as of the time of this update ATOM has reclaimed the first spot by a slight margin.

I also mentioned that I think February could be a positive month. The reason I feel this way is that I think the bad macroeconomic news is mostly over in the short term. The earnings reports I've seen coming out in the stock market have been mostly positive and we've seen rallies in tech stocks in particular over the last several trading sessions. These broad macroeconomic signals look good in the short term, although when the Fed actually starts raising interest rates in the US in March we'll see if those trends can continue.

Without further ado, here are this week's financials:

|Coin|Suggested By|Buying Group|Qty|$ Invested|Current Value|% Gained/Lost|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ATOM|u/Proud_Appeal_6807|A|4.453|$125|$129.65|+3.71%|

|AAVE|u/jetlaggedandhungry|B|0.7003|$150|$80.40|-22.39%|
|ETH|N/A|D-Control|0.04068436|$150|$113.56|-24.29%|
|XRP|u/pundixmaster|D|175.419|$150|$110.08|-26.61%|
|SOL|u/MrHeavenTrampler|B|0.9619|$150|$106.13|-29.23%|
|OCEAN|u/Ultra_burger|C|167.8|$150|$97.19|-35.21%|
|VET|u/newbonsite|A|1441.67|$125|$79.60|-36.31%|

|Total|N/A|N/A|N/A|$2750|$2178.47|-20.78%|

A couple of additional noteworthy items to point out. Last week the portfolio as a whole was down over 25% and there were 3 projects in the positive. Due to the negative movement from ATOM and LUNA there are just barely 2 in the positive now but overall it's down just over 20%, a significant improvement from last week due to the other coins in the project mostly having good weeks. Looking at the bottom section of the list, last week there were 4 projects down over 40% including one that was down over 50%. As of the time I'm making this post, there are no longer any down 40% or more. Overall it's been a bit of a ""reversion to the mean"" week where BTC remains very close to the mean over the overall experiment.

Next week's update will feature a point where all 19 coins in the project will have the same total spend, so it's one of the more exciting ones. If I have time I'll also provide an update specific to the dips I purchased and how those decisions are working out for me so far (it won't be good unless we have a really good week!).

Unfortunately, the interest rates here have been relatively low until now. When I say relatively, I mean that you get between 2-5 percent on stablecoins like DAI, USDC and USDT on various platforms like Binance and coinbase.

For the longest time, the strongest competitor has been anchor protocol, which has offered about 20% annually for stable coins. However, even this pales in comparison to certain crypto projects that have APY of over 50% (for example, CAKE and AXIE on Binance.)

However, WhiteBit is now offering 28% on USDC  for a one year contract. Which I feel like is an absolutely amazing plan for if you would like to store away some cash for a little while.

I can do 2.65% but the monthly payments double.

To me my thought is the lower monthly payment could free up some money to invest for a home. Im already investing a significant amount for retirement outside of this equation BTW. It will lower my monthly payment from $425 to $180. I could always just, later in life pay it down more aggressively if I have more money and bought a home. 

I'm going under the assumption that loans won't be forgiven/0% much longer too...and these rates will go back up after.

I'm refinancing some public loans in the mid 4% interest and private loans that are mid 3% interest.

I'm not particularly worried about losing federal protections on some of my public loans. I still get 12 month forbearance if I lose my job or other ""situations"" and the loan is forgiven if I die or have a long term disability.

Background:

* Approx. 4-5 years of engineering experience + a few years of hands-on fabrication production
* I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering spring 2021
* I'm in my late 20's
* $41k Federal Loans - payments start May
* $20k current assets
* I got a job as a low-level engineer at a large refrigeration company for 6 months, but it ended up being terrible, so I am currently not working.

I have been in contact with several recruiters, and was able to do very well in an interview with Cook Medical for a mech. eng. contract position.

Their offer:

* $38/hr contract work for 12 months ($79k/yr)
* Essential benefits (health insurance, etc.) included, no 401k match
* 4 weeks of immediate, intensive job training

I'm not super familiar with the medical device industry besides some of what Stryker Corp does. I am confident in my skills and abilities to learn what is necessary for the position.

I'm hesitant since I would need to move to another new city away from anyone I know, which is a lot of work and without any social safety net to help with the move.

The biggest hesitancy I have is I moved for the refrigeration job and it went horribly.   
(The short version is HR went from extremely competent and fast during the hiring period to very unaccommodating once I was hired. I wasn't trained into the position or even given task deadlines by my manager, even after requesting them. Meetings for addressing this were blown off more than once. Everything seemed good at the start; good online reviews and personal stories from people I'd talked to at the company before and after starting.)

The recruiter emphasized during our last phone conversation that having Cook on my resume would be a ticket into almost any other engineering corporation, even if I decide to not pursue being hired as a regular employee at the end of the 12 months.

Naturally, I'm a bit skeptical.   
At this point, I am completely burned out with the idea of doing more work I don't want to do so I can get a higher paying job later in a field that I have no motivation to continue in.

CryptoCurrency,A New year’s Insight into Blockchain Index Investing.,"""
A major characteristic of traditional loans is their inaccessibility for the less privileged. Therefore, I was really impressed with the concept of Microloans/Microlending when I stumbled upon it. Microlending is the act of granting small loans (microloans) to those in financial need. These loans are generally used by entrepreneurs with a business idea or SME’s who need extra cash to expand their business. They can range from $20 – $1000 and have extremely affordable interest rates (or in some cases no interest rate) and terms. The main goal of microlending is to help entrepreneurs who would otherwise be unable to borrow money to launch or expand their businesses, thereby reducing poverty in impoverished areas. 

Today’s microlending system involves a website like suku.world, investors, (a microlender that lends to borrowers in a particular location like a financial institution such as a small NGO or large commercial bank), and a borrower. Investors browse the microlending website for one or more people or ideas in which they may want to invest. The microlending website collects the funds and channels them to the borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. The borrower then invariably pays back the microloan with interest.

stocks,STEM is about to explode because 50-60% of their revenues are in Q4 and they aren't priced for it,"Edit - in hindsight I should have just posted this in WSB because this isn't a ""stable alpha"" type of play. This is a medium-intensity speculation with some positive signs.

50-60% of revenue in Q4 (so current P/S isn't accurate). Massive (over 300%) revenue growth, high margin energy management software contracts, electricity storage growth, utility-scale energy management aquisition, fantastic balance sheet, experienced management team, sticky product.

Already brought gross margins positive in the last quarter which is better than Fluence (their main competitor in energy storage)

STEM already has lots of contracts and just won the biggest energy storage contract for NYC. Their software also assists in commercial EV charging integration. They are a ""pick and shovel"" play for the green energy transition and they have a long term high-margin vision with low capital cost.

They just recently raised debt at a 0.5% interest rate and a super high conversion price, proving that institutions have conviction. Strong buy.

An analyst recently raised their FY 2022 revenue forecast.

Edit - their management from the beginning has projected 50-60% of revenue in Q4 because energy contracts are seasonal. He has reaffirmed this on every interview including in Q3 earnings. He's an ex-GE guy with a lot of experience running utility/electricity companies.

I'm not someone who gambles on startups but this is actually a genuinely undervalued company and has the management to run it well. They beat revenue and EPS massively in Q3.

Edit - here's sources. I'm a ""shill"" for this company because it's geniuinely undervalued.

Edit again - I'm aware this is speculative. But it's less speculative than vaporware companies or penny stocks. 149M of revenue on a 1.7b market cap is a P/S of 11 on a company with a multi triple-digit growth rate, improving margins, recurring business model and a green energy pick-and-shovel play. 

This is risky, and I think it'll pay off.

personalfinance,Why does my tax refund decline when I have two W-2s?,"I graduated college late 2020 and I was granted a post graduate student worker contract. I was able to work for my school 40 hours a week until March 2021. 

I am fortunate to say that I landed a job by the time my contract was over so it was a pretty seamless transition. I got my W-2s from my student worker job at the university and it amounted to those 3 months of work. My current employment spans over 9 months from March 2021 to the end of 2021.

I entered my student job W-2 into TurboTax and it calculated a pretty nice federal return. Once I entered my current job's W-2, my federal tax return plummeted and I owe a bit now. Both jobs were full time. I didn't have one main job and a side part-time, it was one full time transitioning to the next. 

I am single, no dependents, no assets (yet) and I'm pretty certain that I claimed 0. The state of Oregon taxes me a lot more on my income than other states I've lived in before so I don't really know what I was expecting. 

Any quick insights that I can learn from here? Thanks in advance!",finance,1643754219.0

Long story short, I had someone help me with my taxes and over December 2021, my place of employment has changed ownership. I like to get taxes done each year as soon as I get my W-2 forms in, so I got my taxes done with my first and only form that I *knew* I had. Today comes and I go into work, and I was then told that there was a second W-2 form and I should have waited. Once again, I *was not* made aware that we had a second form coming. I never received it in the mail through paper, but through an app that out company uses as a digital W-2 form. I'll note that the total on that W-2 was around $396, not anything huge.

I always file through TurboTax and got off the phone with an agent not even 10 minutes before making this post. They said that there is nothing I can do until my 1040-X form arrives in the mail thorugh paper, and when it arrives I can amend it then but through paper only, and not through TurboTax.

Now long story short, I am paranoid about getting in trouble with the IRS over this. The agent I spoke to said it's unlikely to happen, but I am still worried. Please help me ease my mind and let me know if there is anything else I can do besides amend my state and federal taxes over the paper form or if I can get in trouble for this at all.",finance,1643755149.0

personalfinance,1st Mortgage Application Questions,"So let me preface this by I've tried asking a few mortgage originating folks but have received vague or no answer at all. I can't blame them. This is a new situation and I have a lot of dumb questions. I'll try to give info as specific and relevant as possible without obviously doxing myself and keep it short.

Circumstances:We're moving a few states over this summer for my wife to begin a federal job this fall. Due to the nature of this job, she has a 3 year contract (civilian) and thus as guaranteed as income can be. The first year should be about 60k (paycut) but the next years after that are about 85k yearly. She has a long work history that's rock solid, and a credit score in the low 700s.

I've been a paramedic for over a decade now, the last 8 years with the same outfit. Last year I was injured and workers comp and the medical community don't give 2 fucks, so I reduced from 7 years of full time (wages around 75k/year) to part time. I've been part time 1 year now, but I'm not sure what my income will be as I'm in the process of figuring that out for the IRS. My credit is OK, I have old debt and running in the mid to high 600s depending on the credit card balance. I am the weak link here, clearly. 2020 AGI was 130k and I expect this year to be around 100k AGI.

That said, during my down time this last year I got my investment advisor license and a commission only type financial advisor job. (i.e. insurance sales lol) so aside from carrying consumer debt, I'm in outstanding condition financially. I have about a 5% down payment sitting around in assets that I'm converting over to cash depending on the markets. I'm also working on nuking the revolving consumer debt, expecting that to be significantly reduced by mortgage application time. There's a large chunk of assets besides that as well, that the bank would likely be assured by.

Edit for extra detail: Looking to qualify for a ceiling of 400k so we can operate in the low to mid 300's which is easily reasonable for the market we're getting into.

Questions:

1. Is my current part time status going to hold me back on finding pre-approval for a mortgage?
2. If so, should I go back full time? It's a matter of when, not if I'm injured again, and I don't know how disability looks on a mortgage app. Might it be worth the risk?
3. I'd like to move 1 month prior to my wife starting her new job, which means pre-qualifying for a mortgage probably 3-4 months prior? I know I'm supposed to have a new job lined up in the new state, but I don't know how to bridge the gap between leaving my current job, moving, and landing a new gig. What is the ideal timing for these things lining up from the lender's perspective???
4. 1st kid is on the way, and being a stay-at-home-dad is on the table for me as well. Kid doesn't arrive until later this spring, so at least for a while I'm going to stay working. Unsure if I will though, since childcare costs as much as an average income as well. How can this be approached with respect to the mortgage?
5. So far income doesn't suffer too much from my part time status to being a stay-at-home-dad. Can supplement a part time income fairly easily, collecting interest on USDC through a US registered broker company (Voyager.) I know banks tend to hate crypto, so I don't know if this is something that's even worth mentioning.
6. Do you see any other pitfalls or problems I don't seem to be addressing? I've never bought a house before and have \*NO\* idea what I'm actually doing. Roast me if I can learn from it! (Or even just for fun!)

Thank you!

personalfinance,Huge life changes and needing budgeting advice,"Hi all, as title states my spouse and I are going through some huge life changes and our financial life needs a major renovation. We recently welcomed out first child late last year and that has been a great change. However, we aren't sure where to start with our finances. We have kept our finances separate throughout our 6+ year relationship, as we both have different spending habits and hobbies. Prior to 2020, Spouse 1 had been the main income earner as Spouse 2 started college and worked part-time in a trade industry. Household finances were split about 70/30 during that time because Sp1's income was 2-2.5x Sp2's income. Both of us were heavily affected by the pandemic and industries shutting down, leaving us both on UI while trying to get into our desired careers. Our 2020 &amp; 2021 incomes were less than any years prior. Both of us were finally able to get jobs in our new career in the second half of 2021. We had no money saved and \~1k of credit card debt when wife had an 8-week maternity leave. We came out of that with an additional \~1k of credit card debt. We live in a MCOL (bordeline HCOL, post-pandemic). Our home - a very moderate, starter home - is paid off in a trust, but we do make monthly ""mortgage"" payments, as if the trust was acting as the lender. Once the trust is executed in the future, the house will be in our names and no additional monies will be owed.

To start 2022, we both now have matching net incomes after health care plans &amp; taxes are deducted.   
Monthly net income: $4,600  
Total Expenses: $4,415  
Our average monthly expenses are as followed:  
\- Mortgage = $860  
\- Utilities (Gas, Water, Electric) = $350  
\- Internet = $140  
\- Mobile Phones = $70  
\- Car payments (1 leased &amp; 1 financed) = $520  
\- Auto insurance = $190  
\- Housekeepers = $250 (this is a non-negotiable expense we have decided to make after baby arrived)  
\- Fuel = $250  
\- Groceries = $400   
\- Baby supplies = $200  
\- Child care = $0 - We are so fortunate to have family members watching our baby while we are working!  
\- Eating out = $300 (breakfast/lunches during the work week and a monthly date night)  
\- Subscriptions = $300 (needs to be reviewed and some cancelled; a few big ones are software for school &amp; work use)  
\- Charitable Donation = $25  
\- Sp2 Hobby = $400 (non-negotiable, does side jobs -not included in net income- to cover at least half every month &amp; Sp1 not expected to pay anything towards this)  
\- Investments &amp; 401k = $60 &amp; $100

Debts:  
Credit Cards = $3,600 (20%-26% APR)  
Federal Student Loans = $16,000 (both still in school; no payments being made, no interest accruing)

We're both in entry-level positions right now, as we are transitioning into our careers. Sp1 is at the entry level average for the position. Sp2 has more experience than what is considered entry-level, but is taking \~$15k less annually than the market average due to having an irreplaceable workplace.

We are considering opening a joint checking account strictly for hard monthly expenses, in which we will both have a set amount of money contributed from our direct deposits. Everything in that account will be on autopayment, and no debit card will be available for use. Contributed amounts will be rounded up to account for any unaccounted for increases in utilities. We will still have our own individual checking accounts for separate subscriptions, hobby, etc.

We know that our eating out expense can be decreased, but then our grocery expense will increase. As we're both working full time, full time students, and have an infant, time for cooking is incredibly limited.

I got 97K HELOC on my home that is estimated at 395K. 

Do people actually pay the HELOC off -- or do they just pay interest only ?

I have 3 draws available on my HELOC.

I used the first 2 on a Earnest Payment for a new home, a rate lock deposit on a new home, and will draw a 3rd time for the Cash to Close on a new home. 

I locked the interest rate on my first draw at 5.5%.

The 2nd and 3rd draws - i'm not so sure if I should lock the rate - or if I should just pay interest only?

It's a 10-15 year term I think - so if I pay interest only for 10-15 years -- the assumption is that I will just sell the home before that -- or pay off both the mortgage and the HELOC before the 15 year term. 

Paying interest only is alot cheaper than paying the principal on 97K.

I thought locking the interest rate on the first draw was a good idea - since interest rates were going up. But since I can't even reclaim that 20K into my available line of credit after I pay it back -- it seems like that was pointless.

CryptoMarkets,Walmart NFTs? Seriously??,"""
A major characteristic of traditional loans is their inaccessibility for the less privileged. Therefore, I was really impressed with the concept of Microloans/Microlending when I stumbled upon it. Microlending is the act of granting small loans (microloans) to those in financial need.

 These loans are generally used by entrepreneurs with a business idea or SME’s who need extra cash to expand their business. They can range from $20 – $1000 and have extremely affordable interest rates (or in some cases no interest rate) and terms. The main goal of microlending is to help entrepreneurs who would otherwise be unable to borrow money to launch or expand their businesses, thereby reducing poverty in impoverished areas. 

Today’s microlending system involves a website like suku.world, investors, (a microlender that lends to borrowers in a particular location like a financial institution such as a small NGO or large commercial bank), and a borrower. Investors browse the microlending website for one or more people or ideas in which they may want to invest. The microlending website collects the funds and channels them to the borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. The borrower then invariably pays back the microloan with interest.

30. Reports say Solana went down again for several hours on January 4th, 2022. Maybe this is a strategy to normalize the idea of “decentralized blockchains” that can be turned on and off at will. [https://twitter.com/ChainNewsBTC1/status/1478467293478895620](https://twitter.com/ChainNewsBTC1/status/1478467293478895620)

35. Liqwid Community Call #4 happened on Jan 5, 2022.

56. Seabug has dropped a new medium article on their protocol for self-governed NFTs. This may turn out to be somewhat controversial to some since it may be seen as diminishing the unimpinged bearer bond like status of a crypto token issued under the protocol in exchange for theft protection. Many will like that. Some will not. Mlabs is mentioning a late February release for the actual NFT marketplace.

74. Alessandro gives us a big update on exactly what was going on with Nami wallet over the last few days (blockfrost mempools full) and how Blockfrost has gone about fixing it (spun up more nodes…30 now…with more mempools).

personalfinance,Is 529 unqualified penalty tax on top of capital gain or income tax?,"Hello. I just opened 529 plan account for my son but highly likely we will move back to foreign country within 10 years. So I want to know about the unqualified withdrawal penalty. 

They say penalty is 10% federal tax plus additional 2.5% state tax (in CA). Are the penalty taxes on top of the capital gain tax? 
Like 15% capital gain + 10% penalty totaling 25% should I pay for? Or it’s just only 10% and 2.5%?

personalfinance,Rate lock on ARM for new construction in the current interest rate climate?,"We paid deposit and signed purchase agreement on a new construction that is supposed to be completed in June this year. $700000 home with 20% down, excellent credit.
The builder's lender called about a new product they have. It's a 15/1 ARM with a rate lock of 9 months. If I lock today, I can get 4% on the fixed rate part of 15 years. The rate caps after that are +2% annual and +5% for the life of the loan.

The sales pitch from the lender is that they came up with this product specifically to address two things: rising rates and the very real supply chain related likelihood of the house not being done in June.

With this lender, the other option is to wait and do a 90 day lock. If I lock today (not an option really with my construction schedule) the 30 year fixed rate is 3.75%. Lender predicts this will go up to 4 or more by the time I'm 90 days within the realistic close date.

My thoughts have been fluctuating. On one hand, with inflation and polls suggesting at least 3 federal rate hikes this year, the 4% lock for 9 months is not bad. On the other hand, should I not be getting into an ARM at all, even with a 15 year fixed component, and just risk paying more for a fixed closer to my actual closing?

personalfinance,I’m wondering if a cash-out refi on my mortgage is worth it.,"My current mortgage is a 20-yr at 4.25%. I owe $91k-ish on it; purchased at $113.5k. The house appraised at $130k-ish when I bought it, but would have definitely increased in value since purchase in 2018 (the house 2 doors down, albeit bigger, just sold for $215k a few months ago). 

I’ve been saving cash for a small 15’x14’ addition on the back of the house, but with the pending rate hike I was considering a small cash-out refi to pull out maybe $20k or so, and also obviously to lower my interest rate. I’m curious what all I should consider here. The obvious option is to just save more cash for a couple more years and not mess with it. My thought was if I could pull out a little equity, lower my rate, and keep my monthly payment more-or-less the same, it’s sort of a no-brainer.",finance,1643810151.0
CryptoCurrency,All the world's Bitcoin can only pay 2.43% of $30T US national debt,"All the world's Bitcoin can only pay 2.43% of $30T US national debt


The latest grim milestone for the U.S. economy means that its national debt total is now 4,000% larger than the Bitcoin market cap.

The United States’ national debt has passed $30 trillion — and even all the Bitcoin (BTC) in the world would hardly touch it.

According to the latest official statistics, U.S. national debt is at levels never seen before, passing the psychological $30-trillion barrier for the first time this week.

Bitcoin is worth less than 3% of U.S. national debt
After two years of liquidity injections fuelled by issuing even more debt, the Federal Reserve is attempting to rein in what has become a practically incomprehensibly large debt burden.

$30 trillion — $30,000,000,000,000— is a number so vast that it makes even the entire cryptocurrency market cap look like a drop in the ocean.

Looking at Bitcoin specifically, with a market capitalization of $731 billion, it is 2.43% of the national debt tally.

As such, even if the U.S. were to purchase all the BTC in circulation, it would still only pay off that tiny fraction of its debt.

The sheer size of the total did not go unnoticed by Bitcoin proponents, who discussed the topic in earnest on social media.

“As the debt spiral grows, the purchasing power of the Dollar will continue to be sacrificed for political interests and Wall Street bailouts,” on-chain analyst Dylan LeClair summarized.

# [Nasdaq futures jump 1.5% after Alphabet pops on strong earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Nasdaq futures jumped in early trading Wednesday, after the technology-focused average gained for a third straight day.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the index rose 1.6%, while Dow futures were up 50 points, or 0.1%, and S&amp;P 500 futures gained a more robust 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Google-parent Alphabet jumped about 10% in premarket trading after the company’s quarterly results beat on the top and bottom lines. Alphabet also announced a 20-for-1 stock split, indicating the company might soon be included on the Dow Jones Industrial Average as well.
*****
&gt; Chip stock Advanced Micro Devices also gained 14.5% on strong earnings, while Starbucks dipped 2.7% following its results. PayPal tanked 17% after hours after issuing disappointing guidance. General Motors shares rose 2.6% premarket after the automaker reported earnings that beat estimates and raised its 2022 forecast, though revenue came up light.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, private payroll data fell by 301,000 for the month of January, which was down from December’s growth of 807,000 private payrolls, ADP reported Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones were expecting 200,000 private jobs were added in January.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the major averages rose for a third day as stocks attempted a comeback from their tumultuous January where the S&amp;P 500 has its worst month since March 2020.
*****
&gt; The Dow added more than 270 points, helped by a 4.1% gain in Boeing. The S&amp;P 500 also registered a gain, climbing 0.7%. Bank stocks were some of the best performers Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.75% as investors await key technology earnings after the bell and throughout the week.
*****
&gt; “The market has strung together a few solid up days,” said Jim Paulsen, Leuthold Group chief investment strategist. “This strong showing is causing more investors to wonder if the correction is over and raising concerns that they could miss out on a nice post-correction rally.”
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues on Wednesday with key reporting from Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook, and Qualcomm. AbbVie, D.R. Horton and T-Mobile also report earnings on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; So far this earnings season, more than 36% of the S&amp;P 500 has reported and more than 78% have topped Wall Street’s expectations.
*****
&gt; “While the earnings season began with some disappointments last week, it has become more solid in recent days,” added Paulsen.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off of a volatile month, mainly spurred by a pivot in the Federal Reserve. However, some Fed members have have offered reassuring commentary that they do not want their pending rate hikes to disturb the financial markets and that few see any appetite for a 50 basis point hike.

I noticed that there was nothing on the signature line (I did use my drivers license and my AGI from 2020 for the electronic signature through TaxAct) and that TaxAct claimed that both my federal IRS and my state returns were accepted minutes to hours after I filed.

I had to request a return transcript back from 2020 and use the AGI and also use my driver's license to verify my identity in lieu of an electronic signature. Is this also legit?

When I checked on the status, the IRS said that they received my return and didn't accept it. The state website (which is MD) said that my return wasn't even processing.

I understand that I may be acting impatient, but I am only paranoid because this is my first time filing with TaxAct.

How do you convince yourself to invest it vs. just leave it sitting, especially at a time where the market is high and there's chatter of interest rates rising to quell inflation and churn the market?

A little background - I am single, M, and I max 401K &amp; HSA for the year. Earn too much for Roth IRA contribution without backdooring it. I am planning on using some of my taxable account to increase my diversity into small/mid cap stocks &amp; a bit of international as my 401K does not have good options for those (most of that is in a S&amp;P 500 index + a small percent in an emerging markets index with ultra-low expense ratio). That money is beyond my emergency fund, which for me is around 9-12 months of expenses, as well as other funds that I will need when I move in June/July to my new house.

The hardest mindset is to convince myself that a drop in the market is temporary, especially since these funds will  be held for years and years (31 y.o.)

ethereum,Deflation is economically sound for Ethereum,"Some recent comments on this subreddit have suggested that Ethereum should be made inflationary to spur economic activity, so I wanted to give my perspective on why deflation is economically sound for Ethereum.

TL;DR: *Inflation* of a fiat currency erodes savings and *deflation* can bankrupt debtors, slow down economic activity, and lead to unemployment. Central banks balance by targeting a 2 % inflation, keeping some margin for lowering nominal interest rates to 0 % in recessions. For Ethereum, the potential issue with deflation is restricted to slower economic activity. Participants have two attractive choices in the proof-of-stake ecosystem, locking up their tokens for staking or participating in the smart-contract economy. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. Inflation can thus be produced by increasing the yield, but this will slow down activity, not increase it, since it incentivizes people to lock up their tokens for staking instead of interacting with smart contracts. A deflationary Ethereum where the burn rate is higher than the issuance rate attracts capital and developers that wish to capture that capital. Thus, deflation is economically sound for Ethereum considering its forthcoming proof-of-stake consensus.

\--------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, it is suggested that cryptocurrencies should be inflationary like fiat currencies so that users are motivated to spend their tokens, not just hold them. It is important to understand the difference between a central bank trying to balance the desire for high employment and low steady inflation of its fiat currency system with that of a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency trying to make its smart-contract economy flourish, maximizing network effects.

Central banks commonly target a 2 % inflation. A too high inflation will erode real wages and savings, lead to rising tensions between social groups and costly periods of disinflation. Periods of deflation on the other hand are often associated with economic crises and bursting bubbles. As demand falls, companies reduce their workforces. Debtors have a hard time paying back their loans denominated in nominal terms and the subsequent defaults remove liquidity, risking a deflationary spiral. Wages would need to fall each year to keep up, but a downward wage rigidity can be expected. In the absence of workers accepting yearly pay cuts, unemployment may rise further. The fact that people can increase their wealth by hoarding cash is also detrimental to economic activity in periods of deflation. Thus, a 2 % inflation target gives central banks some margins down to 0 % so that they can lower nominal interest rates in recessions to spur economic activity, avoid deflation traps, and reduce unemployment.

The realities of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are a little different. Deflation causes a rise in the value of the ETH token, but wages are not denominated in ETH and neither are mortgages. Deflation does not bring potential unemployment or spiraling debt burdens. It is rather a fall in price that can be destabilizing, with cascading liquidations among those that lent out their tokens in return for some other form of value, like stablecoins.

The risks of reduced economic activity due to increased wealth from hoarding cash stands out as the most applicable also for Ethereum (hoarding ETH in this case). Certainly, it is desirable with high economic activity and demand. It brings developers to the ecosystem and helps build the network effects that cement Ethereum as the engine of Web3. But now consider the two most interesting options available to token holders in proof-of-stake Ethereum. They may lock up their tokens by staking them, earning yield, or they may use the tokens for economic activity, interacting with smart contracts. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. The higher the yield, the higher the inflationary pressure. The higher the yield, the more desirable to lock up tokens instead of participating in the economy. Thus, the relationship between deflation and economic activity is *reversed* in comparison with the fiat economy.

Stakers are a vital part of the ecosystem and should of course be rewarded for their work. But venturing far away from minimum viable issuance to produce inflation will simply constitute a transfer of wealth from those that participate to those that lock up their tokens. Of course, not all forms of ""participation"" may result in high transaction volume. But the mere fact that capital is available and ready to be deployed is arguably important for enticing smart-contract developers to build. If the staking yield is pushed up to produce inflation, the tough competition from the yield of the staking contract discourages development on the chain. It is perhaps not surprising that innovation and economic activity exploded on Ethereum. The promise of an economically sound proof-of-stake consensus in the future in combination with 0 % yield due to proof of work in the short term is an attractive proposition for developers because it produces a lot of capital willing to invest in their DApps. Higher-than-needed staking yield would also force willing participants into a “money lego” of staking derivates, which brings systematic risks to any ecosystem of DApps dependent on them. In a deflationary Ethereum, people can hold ETH tokens without seeing their savings eroded and use them for transactions whenever needs in their daily life arise.

Naturally, it would be possible to produce inflation without pushing up the staking yield if the issued tokens could fund some other desirable development. The problem is that public goods funding is very tricky and would undoubtedly lead to friction in the community. Ethereum is not all-encompassing in the same way that fiat money is within a country. Participants can leave the Ethereum economy at any time if they perceive that their holdings are diluted for questionable reasons or projects. This is a good thing. By preserving the value of the token, we attract people to the ecosystem in open competition. Another way to look at this is to recognize that the deflationary pressure comes from high demand for blockspace (via the burn mechanism of EIP-1559) and the inflationary pressure exists to keep the chain secure through issuance. As long as the chain is secure, deflation is a sign of an in-demand protocol.

One last thing in relation to [Gresham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law):  ""bad money drives out good"", which is often quoted in support of inflationary policies. It is important to note that Gresham's law is applicable for two forms of money with different inherent value but where legal-tender laws specifies that they must be exchanged for the same value. This is not applicable for Ethereum, especially considering the fact that competing forms of money in crypto, including ETH, can easily be reacquired on the open market after using it for payment. For all these reasons, I believe that deflation is economically sound for Ethereum.",cryptocurrency,1643819580.0

CryptoCurrency,For those of you thinking your crypto tax in the USA is a good thing. Here is a brief history of taxes in the USA,"First off, I'm at a strong stance in thinking taxation as theft

What this means is the gov can make up some random number per year or in some cases in a much shorter time per year. And you now legally owe that %. If you don't pay, then they basically have a gun to your head.

Then to make things worse, you have 0 control how the money is used after it is taxed. Like if I think an x industry is over corrupted like the education system. I have no choice but to

1. Just ignore the fact part of my money is going to some corrupt systems which I didn't approve.
2. Make less or no money. Yes while that system gets less money or no money from me. I also get less or none.
3. Somehow change the system. This being finding a way for the corrupt side to work for me, or somehow getting voted in (bypassing a corrupt system) and then get a corrupt system to vote in my favor.

# History

Now as far as the historical on this, remember the American Revolution ended at 1783. Congress issued the first paper money around 1791. Between this time and 1913 there was no Federal Reserve and this is when things went to hell. Note this is the same system Jerome Powell today is over. The one behind the money printer brrr machine. But note war is a major reason for taxes.

Note there was legit reasons to making it, but THIS is why we have an income tax at all and the bulk of our taxes. Prior to this each state was their own thing but unified together. Similar to how EU has a bunch of countries but unified under one system (but I think the EU has a bit more teeth where as the federal prior to 1911 didn't.)

NOTE: the USA did try to do this prior in 1791 and it lasted until 1811 because it was so freaking corrupted.

NOTE: Some blame the Civil War on this one. But the fact is, Civil War ended 1865. Almost 50 years prior. So I call BS on that one.

&amp;#x200B;

* July 6 1797 - an estate tax was made to help fun the U.S. Navy. This was basically an inheritance tax.
* 1802 - Congress repealed the stamp tax on inheritance documents (along with all other internal taxes, preferring to rely solely on tariff duties instead).  After this point there was no inheritance or estate tax for 60 years.
* 1862 -  Congress imposed a ""legacy tax"" to help pay for the Civil War. The basically brought this back but with some small changes.
* 1864 - Congress raised rates for the legacy tax on personal property and imposed an additional ""succession tax"" on the transfer of real estate.
* 1866 - a special revenue commission headed by David A. Wells declared the legacy and succession taxes a failure, noting their low yield and ease of evasion.
* 1870 - lawmakers repealed both the legacy and succession taxes.
* 1872 - they repealed the stamp tax, too, ending another chapter in the history of federal wealth transfer taxes.
* 1894 - The Supreme Court struck down the income tax in its entirety
* 1898 - Another inheritance tax
* 1901 - Congress amended the levy to exempt gifts to many charitable organizations
* Dec 1912 - Glass-Willis proposal was put to the table and debated until Dec 1913
* 1913 - President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law
* 1913 -  Sixteenth Amendment: The first constitutionally mandated income tax.
* 1913 - Capital gains taxes were made (this is why we have to pay the gov even if we are taking on all the risk and time in research)
* 1916 - Congress revived the estate tax
* 1916 - The Revenue Act of 1916 raised the lowest income tax rate from 1% to 2% and raised the top rate to 15% on taxpayers with incomes above $2 million.
* 1916 -Democrats on the committee defended the new estate tax (as well as the bill's higher income taxes) as a move toward fairness. In particular, they emphasized the importance of ability to pay as a standard for policy formulation. As Rep. Charles R. Crisp explained to his colleagues:

&gt;The Democratic Party, while having no fight to make on wealth honestly acquired, believes that a man should contribute to the support and maintenance of the government according to his ability to pay; that great wealth should bear its just and equitable proportion of the expense of the government; and Mr. Chairman, the bill we are now considering raises the entire amount necessary to pay the expenses of this preparedness from the wealth of the country \[53 *Cong. Rec.* 10532\].

(doesn't this sound familiar. Someone taking our money, paying themselves with our money, and then complaining that many aren't paying enough. But while leaving massive loopholes for the extreme wealthy and elite.

* 1921- Sales taxes were first enacted in West Virginia. Eleven other states followed suit in 1933. By 1940, 18 more states had a sales tax in place. Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon are the only states without a sales tax.
* 1924 - The gift tax was made
* 1932 - Under President Herbert Hoover as part of the Revenue Act the federal excise taxes on gasoline. (This started as 1 cent per gallon. In 2020 it rose to 18.4 cents per gallon. Which means the gas station has to sell it above that per gallon to make ANY money before it can pay for anything. If you're wondering why gas cost so much. It is this tax.)
* 1935 - President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act
* 1936 - Dividend taxes were enacted.
* 1937 - The Social Security taxes in January 1937, although no benefits were paid until January 1940
* 1939 - The gov got rid of Dividend taxes
* 1954 - The gov brought back the dividend taxes

Because I don't have the time to keep diving into this, and because I doubt anyone will read this deep into a reddit post. I will end it here with mentioning the centralization of powers is the reason why we have all these taxes in the USA. Even more income and capital gain taxes which heavily mess with us.

Note that during this time and after there was taxes like sin taxes to get people to stop doing something the gov wants them to stop. There is a ton of booze and other taxes I didn't list in here because this would already make this post far far far far longer than it needs to be. Same with hidden taxes like taxes in  NY there is even a taxed for when someone buys a pre-sliced bagel but there isn't if they buy it not sliced. Some of these taxes were caused by lobbying. Like Airline tickets it is expected about 20% to 30% of the ticket cost is a mixture of hidden taxes. This was caused by train lobby groups which wanted people to ride the train more. AND IT WORKED purely due to people paying more in taxes just to fly a plane. So when you hear the gov cares about something, there is something like a worker shortage, or whatever. Look at the tax system first to figure out if they even tried to fix it. If that hasn't changed or got worse, then you know they are talking out of their end.

So in the future, when a political person says they are in favor of crypto. Look at how they are helping us in taxes. If they aren't even trying to fix or get rid of some of these taxes. Then it is most likely all lip service.

&amp;#x200B;

I do think one day in the future we could see a hard push for the gov power to be fully decentralized.

Starbucks is facing a fast-growing union campaign just weeks after the first U.S. corporate store unionized in Buffalo, N.Y. 

Employees at 54 stores in 19 states are pursuing union elections, according to organizers. Fifteen of those stores joined the union drive on Monday, petitioning the federal labor officials to set a vote. The filing coincides with the start of contract negotiations between Starbucks and unionized workers in Buffalo. 

Last month, Starbucks workers at three New York stores held union elections. A majority voted in favor at two of the three locations, unionizing 64 workers. Now, some 30 Starbucks workers in Mesa, Ariz., are wrapping up their own union election by mail. Employees at three more Buffalo-area locations also begin voting this week. Starbucks workers form their 1st union in the U.S. in a big win for labor.

Altogether, the union-election push affects only a fraction of almost 9,000 U.S. stores run by Starbucks. But the quick and high-profile first union victory in Buffalo became a watershed moment for the company, especially as restaurant workers are among the country's least unionized.",finance,1643832669.0
CryptoCurrency,Market rebound by end of February?,"Nobody really knows where the market is going but historically trends show that the market should be on the road to recovery.  A few stumbling blocks that could mess with that theory.

1.  Fed raising interest rates will spook all markets.  It has to happen sooner or later, can't keep the interest rates at 0 for too long.  Its been almost two years and I would expect at least a half point to full point hike by March.  That will definitely cause a dump across the board.

2.  Taxes coming due soon and folks will need to sell un order to pay for their profits in 2021.  Its an ugly cycle but most people don't set aside the necessary monies to pay for their taxes on the profits that were taken in 2021.  So now its time to rob from Peter to pay Paul (a.k.a. Government).

I'm looking to take advantage of that and find a good bank to deposit my salary.

Some of the things that I value:

- Consolidating my logins and interaction points (I'd rather have one bank than two)
- A well-designed and evolving web and phone app
- Having the ability to deposit cash
- ATM reimbursements for out-of-network use 
- Really good mortgage rates for having the relationship
- Zelle support
- No fees on ACH/wires
- Some level of physical presence for same-day cashier checks
- A sound security posture; meaning two-factor auth, ideally through WebAuthn or TOTP, that can't be reset through weak second factors like email or SMS. Knowing the banking industry, I'd be willing to be OK with a weak second factor for my account, but not no second factor at all.

Things I don't care about

- Foreign transaction fees (who uses a debit card abroad anyway?) 
- Overdrafts.
- Interest rates -- I'll only have my biweekly cash flow in there, unless the account requires some amount of money parked there in which case I'd consider the difference in rates vs market as a cost.

Some of the checking accounts I've been looking at are:

- HSBC Premier: Surprisingly not that bad, considering the bad rep that HSBC gets. They pulled out of the US market but still have their Premier accounts. It includes a rewards CC with ~$400 worth of signup bonus and TSA precheck reinmbursement for free. It also has a global view if you have accounts in multiple countries and emergency cash if your wallet gets stolen. Jade does not seem like a useful upgrade since it requires parking $1M worth of assets on what I can only imagine is the crappiest trading platform ever

- Morgan Stanley CashPlus: Gives you a ""free"" Amex Platinum, basically. Requires parking $25k in cash. It's not clear if the ""qualifying investment relationship"" can be an etrade brokerage account. Wording implies that you'll be taxed for the value of the Amex Platinum.

- Bank of America Preferred Rewards: Boosts cash back credit cards over all of their competitors, which is appealing. Also mortgage rates seem good. Not always advertised and I'm sure subject to availability, a small security box is included. Merrill Edge doesn't seem very good but at least it doesn't require parking any cash.

One obvious option is student loan, which is sitting at around 5.3% interest rate and the first payment will be after I graduate in 2 year's time.

Another option is refinancing my current mortgage and getting a cash-out. However, since I had a really low interest rate on my current mortgage, a refinance would actually increase my mortgage interest rate by 0.625% and the first payment would be due 2 months after closing. That said, the rate would still be lower than 5.3%, so I'm borrowing the same amount of money at a lower cost compared to a student loan.

I'm hesitating because putting my house on the line seems rather risky, especially since our mortgage interest rate would increase and we'd be paying more per month for the next 30 years. In comparison, a student loan doesn't require any collateral.

This could be huge for everyone involved in cryptocurrency.

The Jarrett couple argued that new coins are tax-payer created property and should not be taxed until sold or exchanged.

##When you sell, trade, or dispose of a capital asset you incur **capital gains tax**. 

##When you receive crypto through staking rewards, mining, airdrops, the IRS views that as income and it’s subject to **income tax**, just like interest you earn on fiat in a traditional bank.

I am told by lenders that I can lower (3.3-3.49) the rate if I opt to pay monthly PMI or if I buy points by additionally paying some amount over down. My question is what would be a better strategy given the current market scenario.
1. Take up slightly lower rates for PMI and once 20% of property is paid off, continue to pay for rest of the tenure at lower rates without PMI
2. Take up higher rate right now and remove PMI from the very beginning. 
3. Buy points and lower interest rate

Question related to closing cost, is there a way to negotiate on any component of closing cost?

I have talked to Union Bank, Fairway Mortgage, Etc for mortgage pre-approval but not able to decide if I should be getting it from larger banks or mortgage companies? So any advise on that would be super helpful as well

personalfinance,First Time Filing Taxes; Being A Student Lowers Refund by $1000?,"Just  graduated college, and never did taxes before in my life. Both my  parents live outside the country so never had a figure to ask about  taxes.

Anyways, I'm not sure what to even include, but basically 3 different incomes.

* Internship W-2: $8211
* DoorDash: $1838 - $1470(expenses) = $368
* 1098T: Received $12500 scholarship, $5500 was for tuition, so $7000

Took standard deductions and that's about it.

I'm  using TaxAct since it's free, but the federal refund went from $1940 to  $1330 after 1098T. However, it asks me if I was a student during 2021,  and when I click Yes, the federal refund drops to $388.

- $289,000 mortgage with a rate of 3.45%, 30 year loan also with $200 monthly PMI. Hoping to have the house appraised again this Fall to try to get rid of that PMI. 

- $6,000 left on a car loan with 3.7% interest.

investing,Has the Fed ‘put’ been put to bed?,"The writer is chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab via [ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/9e2a743d-5420-4470-a204-abaa2253475e) (non-paywall link [here](https://archive.is/DFI53)):

&gt;Don’t count on the central bank intervening over market volatility  
&gt;  
&gt;If market volatility occurs in a vacuum, it is not the Fed’s job to contain it, unless it actually threatens the stability of the financial system  
&gt;  
&gt;**Don’t fight the Fed.** The saying was popularised by the late Marty Zweig, this author’s first boss and mentor on Wall Street in the 1980s and 1990s. Zweig also coined the phrase: “Don’t fight the tape”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The tape — the record of stocks transactions through the day — is decidedly not fighting the US Federal Reserve, with the prospect of monetary policy normalisation clearly behind a very rocky start to the year for US shares. It is typically a pothole-riddled path that is created when central banks begin to normalise policy — even more so during this anything-but-normal pandemicycle (there’s a new word for you).  
&gt;  
&gt;Conceding that inflation is not quite a transitory phenomenon, the Fed is now on a mission. The launch point for the Covid-19 tightening cycle is unusual, in part due to what appears to be a much later phase in the cycle for the economy than the calendar might suggest. The post-2020 recession expansion is only 21 months new but the inflation, labour market and asset valuation backdrop is decidedly later-cycle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Much recent analysis of past tightening cycles have been limited to just the prior three rounds of Fed rate rises, but those only date back to 1999 — an era characterised by secular disinflation and the attendant positive correlation between bond yields and stock prices. It is different this time.  
&gt;  
&gt;The inflation cat is out of the bag; and arguably, the Fed opened the bag on purpose when, in August 2020, it implemented a more flexible monetary policy strategy. In, short, the Fed has been actively pursuing higher inflation. The aim is to let inflation run hot to compensate for the lengthy era of disinflation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another key difference between the current path towards policy normalisation and past episodes is the Fed’s $9tn balance sheet. Markets are perhaps keenly aware of the perceived implications of its quantitative easing programme of bond buying on yields and asset prices; but they have much less experience with pending quantitative tightening.  
&gt;  
&gt;The plumbing system that connects QE (or QT) to asset prices is indirect and complex. But the psychological system connecting them tends to be more direct. Signals from the Fed about balance sheet plans have been important market drivers — highlighting the power of the Fed’s words, aka jawboning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed officials are now explicitly stating their desire for tighter financial conditions in the interest of moving away from hyper-stimulative policies, squeezing aggregate demand and bringing inflation down. No, imminent rate rises do nothing to solve the semiconductor backlog problem, nor do they bring down the number of container ships sitting off the ports of Long Beach. However, coupled with the Fed’s jawboning, they can arguably change the trajectory of inflation expectations and/or aggregate demand via consumers’ behaviour.  
&gt;  
&gt;The hope is that both the economy and financial markets can adjust to monetary policy normalisation in an orderly fashion. But here is where things might get tricky. The notion of a “Fed put” has been in and out of play since the Alan Greenspan era; with many market participants believing the central bank will step in if markets begin to riot. Do not count on that in this era.  
&gt;  
&gt;For now, financial markets are volatile, but functioning properly. The volatility and weakness are occurring alongside the repricing of risk assets — not being driven by any serious deterioration in liquidity conditions or financial system functionality. In fact, the equity market is a component of most indices measuring financial conditions. As such, equity market volatility-induced tightening of financial conditions could arguably be a feature, not a bug, as it relates to prospective Fed decisions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Back in 2018, Fed chair Jay Powell spoke about the crucial difference between financial market volatility and financial system instability. They are not one and the same.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed’s job is to try to bring about policies — and often create new tools — to ease instability in the financial system. There are times that market volatility can lead to financial system instability. However, if market volatility occurs in a vacuum, it is not the Fed’s job to contain it — unless it actually threatens the stability of the financial system.  
&gt;  
&gt;This year’s increased volatility and correction in stocks is indicative of a less friendly monetary policy. For all the benefits having accrued to the economy and investors’ portfolios of asset appreciation, the Fed is keenly aware that it is time to begin reining in some of the excess liquidity. Absent the renewal of the Fed put, not fighting the Fed remains the market’s modus operandi.",finance,1643860572.0

Forex,Will the Euro get a surprise boost from the ECB today?,"Yesterday’s inflation data from the Eurozone came in well above expectations and may finally push the European Central Bank to implement a more aggressive plan. 

EUR/USD began testing resistance at its 50-day MA as the Euro continues to rally against a weaker US Dollar this week. Given how dovish the ECB has been recently relative to their counterparts, namely the Fed, even the slightest hawkish pivot could see the pair attempt a breakout above this level. 

However, President Lagarde has also been clear in her belief that inflation is temporary and there is no need for the ECB to react in the same manner as the Fed. Therefore, it is very likely that the central bank holds their current approach, putting bearish pressure on the EUR. If the US NFP report on Friday also comes in stronger than expected, EUR/USD could find itself topping out at these levels as the USD regains some strength.

Im not saying the crash is imminent as no one truly knows when institutional selloffs will fully occur but Im sure many know the markets are being propped up and many individuals will realize ""buying the dip"" does not pertain in the coming months because it will continue dipping. We've had a long bull run and a ""serious"" correction is bound. In fact correction will do no justice this will likely be one of the largest bubbles bursting in the coming year and long term investments may gain from a reduced position. 

Many are trying to sluff it off as ""the boy who cried wolf"" since it has been predicted for years but the signs are alot greater than they once were a year or 2 ago. This will likely lead to a 50% reduction for the S&amp;P from its all time highs but take it as you may. Just dont be a 'blind bull' is all im saying. In otherwords blue chip tech isnt even safe. Reverse repos is at an all time high, the feds are printing money like crazy to keep everything propped up. They can't do this forever and the raising of interest rates may be the catalyst that sets off a bigger play in motion. Im not saying Im a guru but if you dont have your finger on the pulse theres no excuse for complaining why your down and out in a bear market.

solar,Help with a proposal and seeking advice/suggestions (new home owner wanting to go solar),"Greetings all. I've read most of the ""rate my quote"" threads on page 1 here and I must say, my quote already seemed awfully high compared to the ones I have on EnergySage, but seeing the ones here and reading comments has me feeling even less positive.

Geographical info:
I live in Central Texas, Austin ""adjacent."" My house has a single sappling out front, there is no shade from trees, etc. I *do* have a 2 story home owning neighbor to the ESE of me but we have 10-12' between our homes for what that's worth. Front of the house faces SSW, the largest sides of the roof face ESE and WNW. Sales guy was saying the panels would be installed on the front SSW and side WNW faces. 

The company now making its way through this new construction neighborhood is Powur. The quote is for a 9.8kW system size, estimated yearly production of 15,170kWh. Cells are ""Hanwha Qcell 350 (BOW) - 60 (x28)"" (apparently not that great of panels at something like 17-18% efficiency but the sales guy is claiming they're the same ones that Tesla uses) and the inverter(s) would ""Enphase IQ8PLUS-72-2-US (x28)."" They're pitching paying for the first 3 years worth of payments at $83/mnth, after which I'd be on the hook for $275/mnth (which is almost $100 more than my highest electric bill this year, which got close to but didn't hit $200). Estimated Federal Tax Credit is $17,423.09, plus a $2,972.12 ""customer incentive."" The loan (through GoodLeap on a 20 year, 1.48%) would be for $67,011.90, with a ""Net System Cost"" of $46,617. This also includes a 10kW battery and they are ""throwing in"" a outdoor/indoor generator connection on the garage as well as $599 towards a generator. The other day the Sales person called and told me they were throwing in an additional $500 gift card if I signed up soon.The price given is supposed to cover everything as an ""out the door"" price. They'd handle HOA/architectural committee, permits, labor, etc. The one figure missing from this proposal that I see others discussing is the price per watt. I seem to recall mine approaching $5/w which I saw being treated as laughably absurd in the other ""rate my proposal"" threads.

Now, I have my electrical data for the last 11 months, by month. I can only look at daily consumption for roughly the last 30 days. The first month kWh usage is not accurate as I came over from another provider who ""threw in the towel"" after Snowpocalypse (pretty sure my current provider is the same as the old with a different name, the website and tools etc. are *exactly* the same). I'm currently averaging 1163.796109kWh per month with a total use of 12801.7572kWh. Peak usage was in August with 1630.017kWh used.  Lowest usage was last month at 901.6388kWh. Currently paying 14.5¢ per kWh. I honestly estimate usage for the past 12 is going to be in the high 13,000 to low 14,000kWh range.

My primary goal is grid independence. I want a system that supplies me with power even when the grid is down, or when the sun isn't out. I want to be generating enough power to have headroom to run the AC a bit colder (I generally run it at 74 when home, but set it to 80 if no one is home) during the summer or worry a little less about falling asleep with the TV or my monitors on, etc. (which is why I am quoted for a system that provides 15,000+kWh even though I feel that's probably not enough for the headroom I'm seeking). I'd prefer just not ever having a lack of available energy to cause me to dip into a pool of credit with a given provider (I'd be using a provider who provides 1:1 credit if at all possible, though it seems like everyone who credits back has some limit or caveat built in so you can't win too much). Right now it is just myself and my roommate I rent a room to. We work at the same place the same hours (we're gone from about 7:30a to 6p) though we trade of work from home days, each of us working from home 2 days and both of us being in office one day. We're night owls and heavy computer users. Roommate has a 4K tv and 2 1080p screens, I have my 1440p and a 1080p screen as well as a NAS running 24/7. Networked house, Enterprise grade 24 port 10Gb switch in the ""attic."" Roommate and my PCs and the NAS run 24/7 as well (UPS for my PC says it's currently outputting 137w sitting here posting on Reddit, ~418w playing ARK, NAS is using ~75w idle, starting a large transfer has it hitting 108w). Roommates PC is a very similar build, but one generation older video card.

The reality is, I am far too ignorant about so many of the nuances that are involved. It would be great if there were a site that I could plug my known monthly usages in, and say something like ""I want to produce enough power that even if all of those months were 400kWh more I still wouldn't be dipping into the grid regardless of time of day"" and have it spit out what I needed to achieve that. Hopefully I haven't gone too far out in the weeds or forgotten important info that might be needed. I'd just really like some help understanding all the numbers and figures and makes sure I'm maximizing anything to reduce cost while still meeting my primary goal of being completely grid independent.

2. When I move my pay will change but I don’t know what it will look like yet. My best guess is that it will balance out or climb a bit. So this is a 6-mos starter plan. 
3. I can’t sell my house until I move.
4. I can’t sell my car until I move (but I won’t anyway. Bought it new but plan to drive it to the ground)
5. You will notice my rental income is less than my mortgage. I have family watching my dogs at my property while I am unable to be there. 
6. Car rental - wish I could ditch this but not possible right now. Chalk it up as a must pay. Willl end when I move.
7. credit card #1 only used by family watching dogs for dogs and/or household emergencies (I.e busted pipe). Credit card #2 only used when #3 doesn’t work. Basically neither 1 or 2 have additional expenses accruing. 


Income: 
- $6814/mos after taxes 
- $550/ mos rent 

Savings: 
- HYSA $8325

- Card 2 total: $3512 (4%, min payment $50, pay between $100-400 dependent on what I spent on it) 
Card 3: pay-off monthly. 

My thoughts are once the house sells I will have enough to pay off everything but I don’t want to count on that. I prefer to start getting ahead of this now. Options may be to refinance the remodel loan to a lower rate then aggressively pay off credit card 1, 2 followed by remodel loan and car.

# [Nasdaq futures drop as Facebook leads tech shares lower](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell early Thursday, as traders pored through the latest batch of corporate earnings, which included disappointing numbers from tech giant Meta Platforms.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 dropped about 2%, and S&amp;P 500 futures slid 1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 68 points, or 0.19%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Facebook-parent Meta Platforms plunged more than 22% in premarket trading after the company’s quarterly profit fell short of expectations. The company also issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter.
*****
&gt; “There was a lot to not like” from Meta’s report, Metropolitan Capital Advisors CEO Karen Finerman told CNBC’s “Fast Money.” She noted that the company’s revenue growth expectations were the “spookiest” part of the release.
*****
&gt; However, Finerman added that the move down seems a “little overdone.”
*****
&gt; Other social media names, including Snap and Twitter, followed Facebook shares lower. Snap shares slid 15% premarket, and Twitter dropped about 6%.
*****
&gt; Spotify Technology, meanwhile, fell 9.6% premarket after the company’s latest quarterly figures showed a slowdown in premium subscriber growth. Google-parent Alphabet, which gained 7.5% on Wednesday following blockbuster earnings, fell 1.4% premarket Thursday. Amazon, which will report after the closing bell, fell 4% premarket.
*****
&gt; In early earnings news, Dow component Honeywell’s shares fell 3.1% after the company beat narrowly on profit but fell short on revenue and provided lower-than-expected guidance.
*****
&gt; Thursday’s moves come after the major averages notched a four-day winning streak during the regular session.
*****
&gt; The Dow rose more than 200 points on the day, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively. Those gains were driven by a jump in tech shares, which were led by a 7.3% rally in Alphabet.
*****
&gt; That four-day jump has helped the major averages trim some of their steep losses after a downbeat January. Last month’s declines came as traders braced for potential rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; “It’s been a crazy, volatile environment, which is what happens when you’re in this transition period of monetary policy and economic growth,” Canaccord’s Tony Dwyer told CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, investors will keep an eye out for the latest weekly U.S. jobless claims numbers released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect initial claims to have fallen to 245,000 from 260,000.
*****
&gt; Those numbers will follow the release of surprisingly downbeat private payrolls data. ADP said Wednesday that U.S. private payrolls dropped by 301,000 in January, while economists polled by Dow Jones had forecast a gain of 200,000.
*****
&gt; There also will be the four-quarter update on productivity at 8:30 a.m. and the ISM services index released at 10 a.m.
*****
&gt; In central bank news, the Bank of England announced a quarter-percentage-point interest rate increase, while the European Central Bank held the line on its benchmark rate despite inflation in the euro zone rising to a new record.

economy,The Bank of England is careening out of control,"Today, the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England announced that they’re raising the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.50%. They said they expect annual inflation to accelerate above 7% within months because of low unemployment and surging energy prices. Markets were off slightly on the news, with the FTSE100 falling after the announcement.

Monetary hawks and doves will both be disappointed by this raise. Doves will argue that consecutive raises—like this was—will burden the economy and put pressure on private and public finances during a spiralling cost crisis, while hawks will argue that it is too-little-too-late to reign in inflation. Whatever your view, the Bank of England is in an unusual position and monetary policy is careening out of control. The economy has been on life-support since the ‘08 financial crisis and the Bank will struggle to save it.

Firstly, the Monetary Policy Committee is too sluggish. At no time in recorded history has the U.K.’s central bank rate been so low for so long. Moreover, the last time the bank rate was this unresponsively low for a sustained period was the 1932-52 Great Depression—getting out of which led to the high-inflation ‘60s and ’70s where rates reached 17%.

https://preview.redd.it/a4xy69c00nf81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=285bb85db0135dc98e635a251610952509edb16c

Rates have been low for too long and unless the Bank gets serious about raising them, it risks reacting to an inflationary spiral too late to do anything about it.

Secondly, the Bank’s balance sheet is enormous and is likely to be contributing to inflation. The total value of Bank of England held assets has never been this large, nor has it ever been this large when compared to the U.K.’s economy. The quantitative easing following the ‘08 financial crisis was never reversed meaningfully; rather it was expanded upon.

https://preview.redd.it/z1q1gea20nf81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92852194d0792aeee28e889354f3f6e19be58479

The last time the Bank of England’s balance sheet approached 20% of national GDP was in the late ‘40s. As inflation began rising, the Bank had to promptly reverse course by raising rates and selling assets. However, it took roughly 40 years to get the problem under control and by the time the Bank’s balance sheet was below 5% of GDP and the policy rate had normalised, the GFC hit.

Interventionist monetary policy of this scale has never been seen before. It is an experiment in the extreme. If policymakers fail to act boldly enough by raising rates and selling assets to control inflation, they risk enabling an inflationary spiral the likes of which we’ve never seen before. If they act too quickly, they risk pulling the rug out from beneath a struggling and debt-laden economy.",finance,1643902425.0

Should I sell any or all of his BNDW and invest it in something more reliable for the long run? He bought them at around 80 and they’ve fallen to 76.5 right now and are continuing to fall due to rising interest rates as per some commenters (whatever that means).

CryptoCurrency,Can someone explain how burning affects those who have coins?,"Forgive me if this has been answered, but I have been researching and this question hasn't specifically been answered in any of the articles or posts I've read so far. 

Mainly, I understand the concept of burning tokens. It's much like removing old bills and coins from circulation or a company repurchasing its stock. However, in each of those instances something of value is traded to who holds those items.

An old bill is usually removed from circulation when it reaches a bank that sends it back to the Fed Reserve top be destroyed, but this is countered by new bills issued into circulation. 

Similarly, when a company repurchases its stock it buys them from shareholders thus providing the shareholders with something of value based on the stock's market value.

In each of those scenarios, there is a 1:1 (or close to) exchange. The way I'm interpreting crypto burning is that the developers destroy coins periodically to remove them from circulation. One of the articles I read on this suggests that an effect of this is that early adapters are less likely to have and maintain a majority share of the value of the coins and encourage newer miners and investors to keep mining.

Are they suggesting that investors' coins are being destroyed? Like, are previously validated coins simply invalidated and then they are useless and sent to a burn wallet? How do they select which coins get burnt off? 

I may be looking at the coins themselves wrong. If each coin has an intrinsic value then burning those older coins would be a capital loss for those whose coins are burnt. But, I guess if we look at each coin as simply being representative of its proportion of the entire market cap of a coin, as in ExampleCoin Market Cap is $1B, and there are 1 million ExampleCoins in circulation, they are worth $1,000 each. However, if you burn off 100,000 coins the market cap remains the same and each coin is then just worth roughly $1,100.   


How are the coins selected and who decides which coins go?",cryptocurrency,1643907866.0

solar,Tax Credit Questions: Re-roof cost eligible? PV and skylight tax credit same year?,"Doing a re-roof and solar install on house in next few months. Replacing 1 skylight during the re-roof. Questions: 

1) I'm replacing the main ashpahlt shinge roof on my house. About 50% of the overall roof surface being replaced (entire south-facing side) is going to be about 90% covered by panels. Does that portion of the re-roof qualify for federal tax credit? How do I got about that (e.g. asking roofer to split the quote into two parts?) Do I need to somehow ""prove"" that the roof needed a re-roof for solar? 

2) My understanding is that if I install a solar shade the skylight it qualifies for solar tax credit BUT I also think that I can't double dip on the solar tax credit for both the PV system install and the skylight in the same tax year. Do I have that right? Skylight is on the north-side of main roof (side not getting panels) if that matters.

CryptoCurrency,Federal reserve already solved blockchain trilemma. And that is gonna change the game.,"You remember blockchain's trilemma? According to Vitalik, a blockchain can't be secure , scalable and decentralized at the same time.






Every blockchain project tried to solve this problem one why or another.

Some acknowledged it by sacrificing one for the other two:





Ripple and Stellar sacrificed decentralization.
NANO and IOTA security. And as you all know BTC and ETH have scalability problems.
Some like Algorand tried to solve the trilemma completely. 








But what few knew was the fact that the Federal reserve already solved trilemma. How?
Easy! There was no trilemma for them to begin with!
Only things important for feds (or maybe any other government around the world) are security and scalability. They don't want decentralization!
In fact decentralization itself is a bigger problem for them than having a scalable or secure blockchain. 








It is the whole idea behind their upcoming CBDC. They even have it on their report. They want full control. And this will change the game.
Why? Because not only their own stablecoin will be the definition of ""centralized"" but also they will fight decentralized blockchains tooth and nail.






Another result is that chains which are less decentralized , likes of XML, HBAR and so on, will most likely benefit from federal backing.
Just like they have the backing of corporates right now. (also XRP once it settles with SEC).
It means they might experience a surge in market cap after federal waves of regulations hit the cryptomarket.









Ofc no one can say for sure what is gonna happen. For all we know BTC price might dive and bring the whole market down with it. Or it might go up! It happened before. specially when the ""penalty"" or ""regulations"" that feds imposed was milder than what the market expected. Still you better keep an eye on those coins.








Best of luck.

defi,"A brief overview of some of the most used DeFi protocols Hello everyone, I've compiled a list of some of the most popular DeFi projects, along with a brief description of each:","**Maker DAO - Borrowing/Lending**

MakerDAO is a decentralized mechanism for collateralized loans in which users may lock up their ETH in exchange for DAI, the DAO's stablecoin. When someone locks up their ETH, they may take out a lesser loan in DAI, which is tied to the US dollar. A deposit of $1000 ETH entitles the customer to a loan of around $650. When the individual wishes to reclaim their ETH, they just repay their loan plus any costs. MKR, the protocol's native token, is utilized in two ways. As the price of ETH falls, it largely serves as a kind of support for the lending system. When a large number of loans are liquidated at once, MKR is formed and sold to pay off the loans, as well as purchased back with the profits of the liquidation fees. It also functions as a governance token, enabling holders to vote on how much fees should be charged and what sorts of collateral should be accepted by the system's smart contracts. Maker has become one of the DeFi boom's flagship protocols, however as we witnessed with the market crash caused by Coronavirus, there is still substantial danger in investing/pooling money in these protocols, which may suddenly become destabilized due to unanticipated occurrences. Though Covid isn't Maker's first existential crisis, having dealt with hacks in the past, the community has persevered and demonstrated incredible endurance to move through these difficulties, frequently emerging stronger and with a more directed path. With a locked value of $6.57 billion, it is the biggest DeFi protocol.

**CRD NETWORK**

The CRD Network is a decentralized bridge that connects crypto and traditional currency transactions. It functions as an API infra Hub – a data stream aggregator — and is an ETH sidechain. In other words, it has a direct relationship to crypto through its connection with Ethereum, but it has a link to traditional finance through connecting into bank APIs.

As a result, this ecosystem enables you to send and receive payments in any of the world's main currencies, digital or fiat, as well as create apps that use this environment. At its heart, the CRD Network is a location where you can develop innovative decentralized finance apps that can interact with the rest of the world.

Because the ecosystem is open-source, everything goes; the only restriction is your creativity.

**Aave - Borrowing/Lending**

Aave is a decentralized network of collateralized lending pools that are managed by smart contracts and allow anyone to freely lend or borrow cryptocurrency. They plan to release version 2 of their protocol in December 2020. Previously, when holders supplied cryptocurrency as security on loans, it was tied to that collateral. Users may now quickly shift their collateral from one coin to another without having to repay their loan or withdraw it from Aave. This improves people's capacity to manage liquidation risk by allowing them to exchange their collateral if the original asset's price began to decrease. Holders of the governance token, AAVE, utilize it to make modifications to the protocol's rules and regulations. In addition, holding the token grants the user numerous benefits like lower fees/rates, bigger borrowing limits, and early entry to particular pools. Aave has also developed ""flash loans,"" which are uncollateralized short-term loans issued and paid in the same block of transactions. This project is far from over with Aave's version 2. According to CEO Stani Kulechov, planned reforms will strengthen and add subtlety to both governance and its quick loans while also striving to cut gas prices across the board.

**Kusari Network - Web3 Substrate and Full EVM**

The fully integrated and operating EVM is now undergoing testing on the Kusari chain. Once operational, the EVM will allow for the simple implementation of current smart contracts and D'Apps to its own chain, as well as the ability for crypto aficionados and traders to exchange their favorite currencies and tokens with ease and at minimal transaction fees.

Furthermore, Kusari empowers its community by putting blockchain power in the hands of its members. The Kusari Chain slogan is ""No Restrictions, No Whitepaper, Just Pure Innovation,"" and we think that this is the only way to accomplish real decentralisation.

The Kusari Chain has an extensive Staking and Voting system to which the community has complete access. Allowing each user to have a say in the chain's future direction and providing them with the tools to ensure that the project and chain remain decentralized.

**Yearn Finance specializes in asset management.**

Yearn Finance is a DeFi platform that provides customers with tokens in exchange for crypto deposits, which are then loaned out through different other businesses such as Aave or Compound for the best rate of return. Yearn finance was founded by Andre Cronje, who quickly abandoned the protocol in favor of a smart contract that required a supermajority to implement modifications. There is a limited amount of 30,000 YFI tokens available. Yearn finance automatically reallocates investors' assets and locates the greatest yielding DeFi products. In other words, it provides the ordinary crypto trader with access to more complicated tactics via an easy-to-use user interface. Its brand awareness and simplicity of use will guarantee that, as the industry matures, it remains many investors' initial introduction to field farming techniques. Though not inherently risky, Yearn searches a variety of high yielding assets, which can frequently result in investors' cash being invested in securities with which they are not personally comfortable. Though these aren't wholly ""risky,"" it's reasonable to wonder if many of the new investors attracted to DeFi through Yearn would feel comfortable if they were aware of some of the riskier methods their funds were susceptible to. Furthermore, the continuously changing market circumstances of cryptocurrency can result in wild price fluctuations throughout the market, and the value of yield farming assets is always at risk of becoming worthless.

**Uniswap is a decentralized exchange platform.**

Uniswap is the most popular and widely used Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (dex). Last year, it made news when it shocked early users by airdropping 400 UNI tokens (about $1,200 at the time) to anybody who had used the network. The UNI token governs the Uniswap exchange, and holders can vote on various ideas, eventually becoming the only decision makers of Uniswap. People may use Uniswap to trade any Ethereum-based token, and they can also contribute Eth and other tokens to supply liquidity, earn fees, and occasionally get additional incentives. Uniswap formerly controlled 20% of all cash locked in DeFi protocols and had approximately 50,000 daily users; it is still quite popular. The cryptocurrency has been extensively disseminated across the crypto community as a result of the unexpected airdrop. It's also one of the most popular venues for introducing consumers to more advanced DeFi ideas like liquidity pools and yield farming. Many Uniswap users utilize the exchange not just to swap tokens, but also to receive incentives for supplying liquidity. Many of these prizes offer excellent returns, which is really appealing. However, there is an underlying risk that many individuals are unaware of. Impermanent (or Divergence) Loss happens when the price of the pooled token deviates significantly from the price specified by the user. The underlying numbers offered are slightly changed when the Automated Market Maker sells tokens to preserve the correct ratio. This risk is frequently countered by the fees and benefits collected, but it may be large in a turbulent market.

**Derivatives - Synthetix**

Holders of SNX tokens can stake them to build on-chain synthetic representations of real-world commodities like as gold, foreign currencies, and, most recently, oil. Holders may also build shorting products such as iBTC or iETH. Kain Warwick created Synthetix after raising roughly $4 million in private finance from Framework Ventures. Governance was previously managed by a foundation, which has subsequently been disbanded and replaced with three decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) over which SNX holders can vote on protocol choices. At its peak, Synthetix had over $800 million in total locked value and still has over $700 million staked with over $125 million in circulating synthetic assets. Their success demonstrates the high demand for the capacity to trade censorship-free real-world assets on-chain, and they are constantly researching, developing, and releasing new goods. Their inverse products (iEth, iBTC, iOIL, etc..) are a unique way to introduce shorting strategies to DeFi newcomers because each iSynth token has an entry point, an upper limit, and a lower limit beyond which the price is frozen and the inverse asset's holder is liquidated into a USD pegged stablecoin to help manage risk. Sythentix's approach of linking conventional legacy assets and new digital assets via these innovative technologies makes a compelling argument for SNX as the field expands and matures. One of Synthetix's drawbacks is its exceptionally high collateralization ratio, which requires 750 percent of staked SNX to the value of the Synth asset. Furthermore, SNX is more volatile than other assets such as ETH, which might lead to increased risk when it comes to maintaining your ratio. Although ETH may be staked, it does not provide the same payment incentives as SNX.

**Lending/borrowing - Compound**

Compound is a system for decentralized crypto lending and borrowing that is powered by algorithms and smart contracts. Anyone with an internet connection and a cryptocurrency wallet like MetaMask may provide or borrow assets at interest rates determined by real-time supply and demand. This enables people to lend and borrow without having to go through a middleman like a bank. When users deposit crypto monies into Compound, they are given c-tokens (cETH, cDAI, and so on) that represent a claim to a share of the asset pool. Loans are overcollateralized in the same way that other DeFi systems are. That is, you must supply more value in cryptocurrency as collateral than you may borrow. Compound was founded as a firm by Robert Leshner and sponsored by venture capitalists, but since the issuance of the COMP token, it has steadily decentralized, delegating authority and governance to the community. Votes have been held on adding coins, adjusting interest rates, and a variety of other enhancement suggestions. One of the inherent dangers in Compound's approach is the risk assumed by borrowers who utilize the cash to purchase more collateral. If an investor deposits ETH and subsequently utilizes their loan to purchase more ETH, a rapid decline in price might result in not just a call on their loan, but also the entire liquidation of their collateralized ETH. Overall, Compound is easy to use and comprehend, which will help it to remain a prominent role in the DeFi community as more people and institutions enter the area.

**Assets and Derivatives - RenVM**

Interoperability is a big issue with the existing DeFi system (and, indeed, the whole crypto field). That is, nearly 75% of the overall crypto market value is not on the Ethereum blockchain and so cannot participate in or interact with the existing major DeFi protocols. RenVM is attempting to fix this problem by encapsulating external assets and functioning as a decentralized equivalent of BitGo's WBTC. Someone with bitcoin may submit it to RenVM, which functions as a decentralized custodian and then issues the Ethereum token renBTC, which is backed and has the same value as bitcoin. RenVM can provide this solution for virtually any digital asset and smart contracting platform, not only Ethereum. RenVM's token, REN, is utilized as a bond to operate as a network validator ""darknode."" It costs 100,000 REN to register and run a node, which is then locked within a smart contract and cannot be refunded until the user deregisters their node. This encourages participants to behave well. When an asset is moved between chains, a charge is collected and paid to the darknode operators.

**Decentralized Exchange - Kyber Network**

Kyber Network is a decentralized exchange and payments platform that enables users to instantaneously trade their tokens for other tokens without relying on a centralized order book. It makes use of ""reserves,"" which are pools of crypto assets that allow for many routes to convert tokens, eventually finding the cheapest price. Though comparable to Loopring, the Kyber Network has a major exchange interface and instantaneously swaps the token, whereas Loopring is the underlying protocol and network of multiple exchanges and serves as an orderbook. When changing ETH to another token, the Kyber smart contract first consults with multiple reserves to get the optimal exchange rate. Then you'll look at the exchange rate and determine whether or not to proceed with the swap. You will send 1 ETH to a Kyber smart contract if you continue. Once received, the reserve will perform an on-chain exchange and credit your account with the token of your choosing. Kyber employs ETH as an intermediary when changing one ERC20 token to another. Token A -&gt; ETH -&gt; Token B is how it works. KNC is Kyber's native token, and reserve holders must pay KNC for the opportunity to administer the reserves. Holders can also stake their KNC in the KyberDAO, which grants them governance rights and returns a staking reward. Furthermore, it enables bitcoin suppliers to accept a wide range of currencies while still being paid in their preferred currency. In these sorts of transactions, the Kyber Network acts as a service.

**Loopring - Layer 2 and Decentralized Exchange**

Loopring, while similar to Kyber, is distinct in this list in that it is a decentralized exchange protocol rather than a dex. This means that Loopring allows anyone to create a custodial order-book based exchange on Ethereum (or any other smart-contract platform), and Loopring then combines the pools on those exchanges into a single massive pool and matches orders across these separate exchanges built using Loopring's structure and participating in the network. Furthermore, after you submit your purchase, your coins are yours until the order is performed. Your coins are not locked into the order book, and you may cancel or change your purchase whenever you choose. Miners, who are responsible for matching these orders, are reimbursed in LRC, and they are motivated with bigger incentives for discovering better exchange rates. Loopring is also notable for being a Layer Two solution. That is, all transactions and trades take place off chain, therefore trading costs are astronomically lower than Ethereum's at peak periods, with the drawback being that it requires a little of extra understanding and the willingness to actually move your coin there.

**Decentralized Exchange - Balancer**

Balancer is an automated market maker similar to Uniswap in that users may contribute their cryptocurrency to liquidity pools to gain incentives, but it differs in that users can construct their own Liquidity Pools with up to eight assets pooled instead of just two. The weights of the underlying assets are arbitrarily defined by the pool's developer and are automatically rebalanced as prices vary to maintain the weight. Anyone may now construct their own self-balancing index fund or invest in someone else's. The disadvantage is that diverging loss is exacerbated since the values of the multiple assets might move more widely than with simply two assets offered at 1:1. It also opens up large arbitrage opportunities because there is no Oracle connectivity to bring in outside prices, thus the prices in the pools only change when someone trades. BAL is the protocol's governance token, and as the protocol evolves, BAL holders will be able to ""help lead the system to its maximum potential."" Balancer expressly mentions various aims, such as deploying the protocol on blockchains other than Ethereum, creating layer two solutions, and instituting fees at the transaction level.",cryptocurrency,1643917851.0

CryptoCurrency,Do you think Bitcoin should be define as an asset or currency (money)?,"&gt; According to Nakamoto (2008), Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system which allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. This definition suggests that Bitcoin is mainly used as an alternative currency. However, Bitcoin can also be used as an asset and thus would serve a different purpose.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\*\*  **Whilst currency be characterized as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value, an asset does generally not possess the first two features and can be clearly distinguished from a currency**.  

If currency, 

&gt;If Bitcoin is mainly used as a currency to pay for goods and services, it will compete with fiat currency such as the US dollar and thus influence its value and ultimately monetary policy.

I heard a debate last night that this could be dangerous because this will ultimately destabilize government and thus will lead to policy to shut it down, may be not with one blow but with small incremental policies.  

Also the new thing with tax and staking. You can't have it both ways. If its a currency then immediately you would be tax as if it was earned interest in your account. 

If assets, 

&gt;If, on the other hand, it will mainly be used as an investment, it will compete with other assets such as government bonds, stocks and commodities among others and potentially influence the financial system and financial stability.

Amazon reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: $27.75
Revenue: $137.4 billion vs $137.6 billion expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts
AWS revenue: $17.37 billion expected, according to StreetAccount
It is not immediately clear if the reported earnings per share are comparable to analyst estimates.

Amazon is wrapping up a rollercoaster earnings season for mega-cap tech companies. Netflix shares were hammered late last month after a weak subscriber outlook spooked investors. Upbeat earnings from Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet in recent days suggested the season could end on a high note, but then Facebook revealed stagnating user growth, which sent its shares plunging and dragged down other social media stocks.

Among the top tech companies, Amazon was the worst performer last year, with the stock rising just 2.4%. It’s down 16% so far in 2022, as investors rotate out of the sector on concerns about inflation and rising interest rates.

Analysts expect Amazon to record year-over-year revenue growth of just under 10% for the fourth quarter, which includes the peak holiday shopping season. That would be the first period of single-digit growth since the third quarter of 2017.

Profit is projected to plunge to $3.68 per share from $14.09 per share a year ago. In recent quarters, earnings have cratered and sales growth has decelerated as the company navigates a slowdown in the pandemic-driven e-commerce bump, global supply chain constraints and labor shortages.

Amazon has been ploughing profits into physical expansion, with Jefferies analysts estimating the company opened 350 new facilities in 2021. It also hiked wages to an average of $18 an hour to lure workers and has increased incentives, offering signing bonuses worth as much as $3,000 in certain markets.

In some cases, the labor shortage forced Amazon to reroute packages over longer and costlier distances to facilities with enough staff to handle them.

CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded Jeff Bezos at the helm last year, previously warned that Amazon would take on “several billion dollars” of extra costs in the fourth period because of the headwinds. Amazon said its operating profit could be as little as zero.

Wall Street will be paying particularly close attention to Amazon’s first-quarter guidance, as investors try to model how much additional pressure the company expects from inflation and supply shortages.

While its core retail business faces clear challenges, Amazon is leaning on other divisions, including its profitable cloud-computing unit and fast-growing advertising division. Analysts expect Amazon Web Services to post revenue growth of 36% from a year ago.

“Amazon’s growth, similar to most other e-commerce companies, decelerated all through FY21, and the market is concerned about that continuing into Q1, maybe Q2, with uncertainty on where growth rates normalize beyond that,” Guggenheim analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month. “Q1 guidance will be in focus this week, and the bar seems quite low, but more important will be any hints as to where sales and margins can go from there.”",finance,1643922438.0

personalfinance,Advice on an AWFUL car loan,"I’m going to start this out with, I know I got duped (and clearly made some shit choices here), so please refrain from nasty comments lol . I’m hoping for some advice though. 
I’ve been driving the same 2006 for about 10 years and own it. It’s not in the best shape, and I recently got a new job that requires traveling sometimes, so I’d stopped by a dealership just to get an idea. I have less than stellar credit due to poor choices when I was younger, that I have been working on building. (It’s 600 rn. It was around 480 when I started working on it 2 years ago.)
Anyway, I test drove a 2020 Hyundai Sonata with 35k miles. I had honestly no intention of getting a car. I was really just looking to find out how much I would need to save for a down payment in the future, and what I’d need to raise my credit score to. I was hoping to save and make my old car last another 6-12 months. 
Long story short, they talked me in to signing a contract. The payment was $580/months for 72 months primarily because my interest rate is high. Like. Embarrassingly high. Anyway, I went to make the first payment and found out that they’re actually charging me $810/month. 
So I looked up my contract and needless to say…that also says $810/month. I KNOW the original contract I signed said $580. I contacted the dealership and was told they couldn’t do anything. So I contacted the bank that the loan was through and explained the situation. I asked if I could surrender the car, but they told me that even if I do, I’m still responsible for paying of the loan. 
They basically told me my only options are to 1. Sell it. 2. Refinance it. Neither of which are feasible. 
Does anyone have any potential recommendations on what I could do? Or am I stuck with this ridiculous payment? I feel so freaking dumb right now and would love a bit of (kind) guidance.",finance,1643927384.0

vet,"Can't find non-prescription food that fits vet's requirements, Vet declines prescription diet request, won't prescribe medicine.","I've had my 8yr spayed beagle since she was 2yrs old ( Family dog but became mine in Oct 2021) and she's spit up/vomited every few days. Previous vet said she'll grow out of it and my parents were satisfied with that answer. Last week she started spitting up every couple hours, I took her to the new vet we started using in October 2021. My vet diagnosed my dog with GERD via endoscopy. My dog has significant scaring along her esophagus due to previous vet saying it was just a young dog thing when she really needed management.

My current vet said to switch my dog's food to one that meets her requirements, but I haven't found one after hours of looking through the guaranteed analysis and ingredients. My vet won't prescribe medication because it's best to try fixing her diet first. I never knew prescription diets were a thing otherwise I would have insisted we get it sooner, so I found a couple vet prescription diets that fit what the vet wants but she declined those too.

This whole food switch sounded easy at first, but I realized every food in Purina, Eukanuba, Royal Canin, and Hills that meets the % requirements uses Chicken or other poultry. Are there any other brands that are known to be WSAVA approved or do I need to do a deep dive into every brand I see until I find one that meets the requirements? Will allergy medicine be enough to counter Chicken by product, Chicken fat, or poultry-by-product? I've never risked giving my dog chicken even though she takes allergy medication.

**Vet's Requirements for Food**

* ≤ 25% Protein
* ≤15% Fat
* Meets WSAVA guidelines

**My Dog's Requirements**

* No Chicken (hives, swelling, drooling; ER)
* No Poultry (Redness and scratching to the point of bleeding)
* No Grain Free

Wouldn't Pro Plan prescription food (Elemental or the Hydrolyzed Salmon) be the safest food that works for both vet and my dog?

**Timeline of Past Food and Digestion Related Events**

* **June 2015**: Foster mom fed her homemade dog food
   * Gave me 1 month's worth of frozen homemade beef, venison, goat,rice, veggie mix to help her transition to my home
* **July 2015**: Kirkland Signature Adult Formula Chicken, Rice and Vegetable
   * Wasn't aware of her allergy and switched her to the same brand I fed my other dogs
   * Hives, swelling, redness, drooling, 2 days in the ER
* **July 2015:** Diamond Naturals Skin and Coat Salmon
   * ER vet said to give my dog allergy medicine daily due to cross contamination in making process
   * Still vomited every few days
* **August 2015- March 2019:** Kirkland Signature Nature's Domain Salmon Meal &amp; Sweet Potato
   * Found out about the FDA investigation into potential links between grain free and DCM
   * Her vomiting/spit up slowed to once every 1-2 months.
   * Old vet still insisting food isn't the issue and that she is just sensitive
   * Alternating between allergy medication types every year to keep them effective
* **March 2019:** Diamond Naturals Skin and Coat Salmon
   * Spat up/vomit once every other week
   * Concerned about the pea/lentil/potato combo as it's just like grain free foods but my parents say it's ok
   * Still alternating allergy medicine every year
* **October 2021:** Pro Plan Sensitive Skin &amp; Stomach Salmon and Rice
   * Gained custody of beagle and finally switched vets
   * Still alternating allergy medicine every year
   * **Jan 21, 2022:** Spitting up in mouth every couple hours

* Take the lump sum (not taxed federally from my understanding)

* Take installments over a period of years (would there be a benefit to this)?

* Where should I invest any proceeds from the estate (I already have about 6 months of emergency funds)?

*Also, I have proceeds from the sale of out last house ($90K) that is currently in the name of one of her relatives (don't ask).

Will it mean that the might might have to postpone their commitment to increasing interest rates?( instead of jumping the rates in march they move it down for maybe april or may ) and since we dont really have much stimulus , could a low jobs report mean that people wont have much cash thus inflation shouldn't be jumping since with no job = no income = not able to buy goods/services.

CryptoCurrency,Stable coins are going to explode and the L1 blockchains are the ones that will massively profit from it.,"The sign is on the wall sorta say.  Amazon is in an all out battle with Visa, feds even hint at coining up with a Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) . Here are some examples.

Here is one from bank of America.

&gt;It appears that the United States will finally be moving forward to create its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to the Bank of America. We expect stablecoin adoption and use for payments to increase significantly over the next several years as financial institutions explore digital asset custody and trading solutions and as payments companies incorporate blockchain technology into their platforms.

And here may be even bigger opportunity, the world of gift cards.

&gt;The global gift cards market size was valued at $619.25 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $2,076.51 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 16.2% from 2020 to 2027. 

What does this all mean? Well to me it means the L1 blockchains are going to be the engines to drive all this and picking the right one could pay off big time.

Projects like Algorand ,Quant, Cardano which are fast ,scalable, secure and green I think will have a good chance. Security and scalable are probably main factors though. There are more so  please share below which L1s do you think will have a better chance.

TLDR: central bank digital currency (CBDC) and stable coins from the likes of Amazon or gift cards is going to happen and the L1 blockchains that will support them are going to profit big time.

edit: there are some confusions based on comment that stable coins are stable so how can you make a profit?  The profit is not coming from the stable but the  L1 blockchain will collect gas fees that is driving the transactions + with the publicity can and will indeed profit.

**—El Salvador Treasury Minister Alejandro Zelaya’s reply to the IMF’s demand to drop Bitcoin as legal tender.**

&amp;#x200B;

[RIGHTEOUS KILL](https://preview.redd.it/2a4govznarf81.jpg?width=1300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c26660aeaf6b3b015db824ad89011a6aa85ee5ab)

Shots fired. I have my opinions on how El Salvador’s president Bukele could’ve gone about implementing bitcoin as legal tender better. Education being one of those things; and making the shitty Chivo wallet open source, or just paying Jack Mallers (Strike LN app) the money he and his team requested, and thus having it built right the first time. When I was in El Salvador last year, nobody I talked to really knew what decentralization was, and assumed bitcoin behaved like a stablecoin—this is obviously improving rapidly on the ground. I also had trouble with Chivo wallet the entire time. I’ve heard this has improved as well, and wouldn’t be surprised if the anti-bitcoin crowd is aiding the attention here with hyperbole. Let’s not forget the trouble our all-powerful US federal government had rolling out a simple healthcare website, and the trouble most states had with unemployment websites last year—a large percentage of claims which were fraudulent.

The most important moment in bitcoin’s history since it went live January of 2009, was Segwit2x in my humble opinion, which was where the majority of the mining hashpower, VC’s, and Coinbase supported larger block sizes. They were soundly defeated and embarrassed. The second most important was Mt. Gox, when bitcoin was very young and fragile, it wasn’t clear afterwards wether or not bitcoin would survive, but surviving that travail was so important. What El Salvador is about to do could potentially be more important than both of those—bonds. In fact, I’m going to go out on a limb and say it ***is*** the most important. Most people are unaware of how important (or far reaching) this is. It’s a complete watershed moment that can usher in an entirely new asset class, literally rewriting securities as they’ve been understood for at least the last 100 years. The global bond market is (give or take) $120 trillion dollars. Most of those bonds are negative yielding junk. Most of these are highly regulated, centralized, and require IRS attached KYC to buy. Most retail doesn’t understand bonds let alone interact with them. All bonds are settled in USD or a nation’s fiat. Imagine bonds settled in BTC. That’s insane. Imagine these are non-custodial. Imagine these don’t have to be held to maturity because they’re tradable on the open market 24/7 with your non-custodial wallet. Let’s just say I think that Coinmarketcap is going to go through some changes in how they list things. Marrying bonds like this to small businesses (LLC’s, sole proprietorships, etcetera), product crowdfunding, small independent countries and municipalities (Algora, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Ireland, Iceland, etcetera), states and territories (Texas, Puerto Rico, etcetera), decentralized insurance, etcetera, could get ridiculous. The biggest loser would be altcoins (shitcoins) in general, and the second biggest loser would be nation states at large, because bitcoin would be competing with public debt a lot sooner than even I anticipated it would, which will pose significant challenges to the way a state (countries) organize. Remember the USD is the world's reserve currency, and we're not a net creditor nation like we were pre-Bretton Woods, we're a net debtor nation.

Bonds could be bitcoin's escape velocity to world reserve currency?

In fact, should these securities even be called bonds? 🤷‍♂️

This is a new asset class that borrows a little from blockchains, bonds, stocks, and derivatives. My belief is that if El Salvador’s first tranche of volcano bonds ($1B) is fully subscribed when they go to market next month, all hell is going to break loose later this year. Anyone remember the \[shitcoin\] summer of DeFi in 2019? Basically it’ll be that, except instead of an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes, enabled by dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going, we’ll have real countries, real businesses, and real products, permissionless securities settled in bitcoin, not rando speculative tokens created by rando douches that besides never establishing themselves as money, somehow believe that money is TPS, TX cost, and throughput, things which are really features of a blockchain.

I’ve said again and again: DECENTRALIZATION AT LARGE will naturally build around a global stateless money. The real version of DeFi, and the real goals of Web3, will get built on, and around bitcoin, which has established itself as money, understands that simplicity is a fundamental security practice, and has the one-dimensional goal of separating money from State. It sure as hell looks like El Salvador’s volcano bonds are proving all of that. They'll get sold in $100 increments. I’ll be buying some for no other reason than to spite the IMF.

18. Reports say Solana went down again for several hours on January 4th, 2022. Maybe this is a strategy to normalize the idea of “decentralized blockchains” that can be turned on and off at will. [https://twitter.com/ChainNewsBTC1/status/1478467293478895620](https://twitter.com/ChainNewsBTC1/status/1478467293478895620)

23. Liqwid Community Call #4 happened on Jan 5, 2022.

44. Seabug has dropped a new medium article on their protocol for self-governed NFTs. This may turn out to be somewhat controversial to some since it may be seen as diminishing the unimpinged bearer bond like status of a crypto token issued under the protocol in exchange for theft protection. Many will like that. Some will not. Mlabs is mentioning a late February release for the actual NFT marketplace.

62. Alessandro gives us a big update on exactly what was going on with Nami wallet over the last few days (blockfrost mempools full) and how Blockfrost has gone about fixing it (spun up more nodes…30 now…with more mempools). You can also use Nami with your own node if you want. They are impressively nimble to be able to address this in such a short amount of time.

69. Looks like no SudaeSwap rewards today and no calculator yet (as of writing on Jan. 25). But, there is a calculator coming and the rewards will now be via DripDropz.

77. The FOMC Policy Statement came down today (Jan. 26). Powell talked about moving faster and sooner than they did last time and reaffirmed that rate hikes will be the principal tool of the Fed from meeting to meeting (and happening before any balance sheet runoff) with balance sheet runoff happening more consistently and predictably in the background once it starts. He said the committee is “of a mind” to hike rates at the March meeting.

Trading,Is GBP ready to make new highs?,"The hawkish surprise from yesterday’s BOE meeting could help GBP/USD extend this week’s rebound into a sustained leg higher. 

Although the central bank ultimately decided to raise interest rates by 25bps as expected, the market was caught by surprise as 4 out of the 9 members voted in favour of a 50bps hike. With the BOE signalling that there are likely more rate hikes to come, we could see GBP/USD rally higher and reattempt a breakout above its 200-day MA. 

However, Governor Bailey was also quick to reiterate that the aggressive monetary policy was solely as a means of dealing with rising prices, not due to a booming economy. Therefore, if we start to see indications that UK inflation will likely cool faster than expected over the coming months, GBP/USD could turn lower and continue its bearish trend.

If you had bought around the year 2000 it would have taken you 15 years to get your money back. (again including inflation)

Now my question is not rather if it could happen as given enough time it surely will. Is it feasible to start in the coming decades? Predicting a recession is impossible and not what im asking. In our current economy does the fed not have the will power and tools to send the economy up? They printed trillions and sure we have some inflation but not nearly to the extent of the amount of money we printed.   


Side question, I am rather young, during the \~1965-85 recovery I had mentioned you could put your money in a bank and get a good return and the disregarding inflation the markets did not drop all that much. So the impact from what I understand was not as detrimental as a graph might make it seem.   


During the tech bubble I would imagine you could also have a fairly easy time determining which stocks were a poor investment and when prices reached absurdly ridiculous valuations.   


It seems these prolonged recoveries while certainly damaging to your finances are not really what they are made out to be. From what i can see if you pay attention to the risks and your options you wont get burned very long. Forgive my ignorance if there is any I have only experienced the covid ""recession"" so something that drags prices down for years is something I have never experienced.

personalfinance,Building/ buying a house at 21... how much can I afford?,"Hi all, 

I'm looking to buy or build a home this year. I've done my research about home prices in my area, interest rates,  cost of land, costs associated with home ownership, costs besides down-payment, etc. 

Every time I use a calculator to see what I can afford, I get a monthly payment recommendation substantially lower than my current rent. My rent is being raised to 1900 at least this year, and I make ~60k a year pre tax. I have no debt, and recurring bills are car insurance, phone plan, groceries, gas, utilities. I've been saving for the last two years for a down-payment.

I feel comfortable and confident paying up to $2000/ month for my mortgage (all in) with no problem, but this translates to a house cost in my area that's 5x-6x my monthly income. I've heard that's a horrible position to be in so I'm second guessing myself.

Obviously the cheaper the better but I WFH and am very passionate about home diy projects etc, so I really value having space and quality (aka willing to pay more). 

I guess my question is this: would I be crazy for buying a house that is way more expensive than the internet seems to recommend?? Feel free to ask any clarifying quesitons!

Edit: I responded to a few comments below but when I say mortgage (all in) I did mean including insurance, property taxes, hoa if applicable, etc.",finance,1643977743.0
cardano,Web3 on Cardano,"The next iteration of the World Wide Web is on the rise, and blockchain is emerging as an essential building block. This iteration has been named Web3. We take a look at whether Cardano fits into this concept. 

# What is Web3

If we are going to talk about the third iteration of the site, it is good to explain what the previous two were like. The first iteration of the web was **read-only**. This means that authors published articles on the server and users could only read them. They didn’t need to log in and no one verified their identity. All information was freely available. Those who wanted to publish articles had to have access to the server where they could save the article. Open-source protocols were used for Web1. The basic protocols were TCP/IP and the most used HTTP. It can be said that the Internet was free.

Web2 was born during the dot-com bubble in the new millennium and is characterized by the fact that users can create and share information. This is the Internet as we know it today. It could be described as **read-write**. Users were given the ability to create and publish their own content. It didn’t have to be just articles, but also emotions, comments on Facebook, or short messages on Twitter.

Web2 ceased to be free because the Big Five pay the bills for running servers and took control of the content and the users. Many services today require users to log in. Digital identity is important, so it’s not surprising that companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have taken control. These companies act as identity providers. This means, that digital identities are owned by centralized authorities that have monopolized trust systems. Today, if you want to log in to a service, you can do so through your accounts with the giants named above. Users have traded convenience for precious information, which they hand over to the IT giants who profit from it, completely free of charge. Web2 users are products.

Web3 extends the possibilities of the Internet with the ability to own. As a content creator, I have no control over the platform where my content is published. I don’t own the text and the platform decides who gets to read it. If the platform decides not to publish the text, I’m out of luck. If the platform decides to delete my account, it can do so at any time. I will immediately lose access to my readers. The goal of Web3 is to enable people to own their content, identity, identity-related data, money, and other valuables. People will decide what they want to share and who to send it to. In addition, Web3 comes with the idea of partially owning the platform itself. If the Web2 platform makes money from advertising, it can keep everything to itself. In the case of shared ownership, it is possible that the profit is split fairly between authors, readers, and the platform. Web3 can be described as **read-write-own**.

# Web3 principles are similar to blockchain properties

If you think about it more, you will find that Web3 basically copies the key features of the blockchain. Let’s demonstrate this on the Cardano network. Anyone in the world can download a Cardano wallet and start using the network to interact financially or socially with their peers. Cardano is a global network and is available everywhere. There is no need to ask anyone for permission. Once a user sends a transaction, she is almost 100% sure that no one will censor it. No one can confiscate ADA coins somewhere in the middle of the process. Key features are achieved through network decentralization and financial incentives. We can say that with ADA coins we have created a platform that is owned by the community and not by a central authority. This will be true as long as the coins are well distributed among users.

Any blockchain network can be viewed as a collection of rules that are written in the source code. In the Cardano network, for example, it is thus tightly defined what exactly to do with the fees collected and how they are distributed between the platform and the stakeholders. Decentralized services, such as DEX, can also be viewed as an organization that can be owned through tokens. Tokens can enable voting and possibly changing the rules or settings of the service. The ability to modify the rules and evolve is quite crucial for the further development of the service. Centralization is advantageous in that rules can be changed or development directed instantly. Unfortunately, centralization is also a weak point in terms of abuse of power.

Cryptocurrencies are popular for many reasons. One of them is the key fact that they are not controlled by central authorities. This makes it possible to ensure the immutability of the rules, which were set up fairly for everyone at the outset. If the rules were to change, it would be a collective decision of the majority. As a matter of principle, only those decisions that are favorable to the majority will be enforced. Control over the rules makes the crucial difference between a centralized and a decentralized system. At the same time, it is a key feature in terms of the possibility of owning or sharing ownership. In the ideal world of Web3, no one can take value away from you or prevent you from creating it.

It can be said that Web3 is an effort to achieve a greater degree of decentralization on the Internet. People could enjoy a higher level of freedom on Web1 but the Internet did not offer users many useful services. Web2 greatly expanded the useful services, but at the cost of centralization followed by misusing of power. Freedom also decreased and it can be said that the power of IT giants constantly grows. Web3 seeks to weaken the power of the big IT giants and put the power back in the hands of the users. This is essentially the same principle that Bitcoin is trying to achieve at the level of money. A certain portion of Bitcoin fans believes that Bitcoin can weaken the position of central banks and replace fiat money. Bitcoin and Web3 have essentially the exact same goal. They seek to give people more control over their destiny and give them the ability to avoid third parties that exercise their strong position.

Web3 helps realize the original vision of cryptocurrencies. If people strive for independence, want to trust technology more, and prefer collective decision-making over central planning, the path to this goal is through decentralization. Cryptocurrency fans seek to redefine the social contract, which is nothing more than changing the rules by which society is governed. Winning over central banks is as big a challenge as trying to beat the IT giants. Both are important to the path to freedom.

If people understand the meaning of decentralization and its benefits, they will want to promote its principles wherever possible and technologically feasible. One could even say that it makes no sense to pursue free money and leave banks, social networks, and everything else in the hands of CEOs. If the concept of decentralization takes hold, it will bring about fundamental societal changes, and we cannot predict what society will look like and what its preferences will be at the moment. Web3 is nothing more than using blockchain technology and solving centralization problems from a different side than originally intended at the birth of cryptocurrencies.

# Why it is important to own the infrastructure

There is a direct link between your ownership and the decentralized network. You can exclusively own ADA or BTC through a private key and no one in the world can take it away from you. However, this is only true as long as Cardano and the Bitcoin network exist and maintain a high degree of decentralization. Should the decentralized network cease to exist, the coins will immediately lose value as well. If someone dominates the network consensus, the network will cease to be decentralized and thus there is no guarantee that the rules will be followed.

People need to learn that if they want to gain control of their assets, it’s not just about protecting their own private keys. It is also in the interest of cryptocurrency owners to maintain a high level of decentralization of the network. Blockchain is a digital technology built on principles of power distribution. This power must be truly distributed among as many users as possible. It must be easy and affordable to participate in decentralization.

In the Cardano ecosystem, it is very easy to participate in decentralization because each ADA coin owner essentially holds a portion of the decision-making power. Thus, each ADA coin holder essentially owns a small or larger portion of the infrastructure that protects his or her own assets. If Cardano prospers economically, all ADA coin holders can be rewarded with the protocol. There is a direct economic incentive to participate in decentralization and decide the future direction of the platform.

# Web3 will have more layers

Complex services are often dependent on multiple protocols and layers. Web3 services will have more layers as well. Each layer will have different properties and can provide a given functional part of the overall functionality. The first layer is crucial for creating and preserving value, so a high level of decentralization and security is important. The Cardano network will oversee the correct number of ADA coins as well as all issued tokens including NFTs. Moreover, the Cardano network will be used as a decentralized public-key infrastructure (DPKI) to create a decentralized digital identity (DID). Cardano can protect users’ private data. The first layer is also where smart contracts are deployed. Smart contracts can be seen as a key on-chain programmable layer for the functionality of Web3 services.

Cardano layer is coordinated by ADA coins and an incentive model. The level of decentralization should be the highest. Services can issue their own tokens for a similar purpose. These tokens will be protected by the first tamper-proof layer, but it can be expected that there will always be fewer token holders than ADA coin holders. The degree of decentralization may be lower.

In general, the first layers of Web3 will enable programmability related to trusted creation of value, ensuring ownership, and transfer of value. All other layers will place more emphasis on a pleasant user interface, which means they can be less decentralized. The higher layers will use the coins, tokens, and infrastructure of the lower layers. The faster technology advances, the more decentralized the higher layers can become.

It is important to realize that users will be the ones who decide to what extent decentralization and security are important to them. At the moment, no one has the answer. All we know now is that people are not very willing to install full nodes on their computers. In the case of phones, it’s not even possible. In addition, users are not willing to compromise on their demands for user comfort, and it is questionable how much they will be willing to pay for services. The approach of users can be individual but we already know how the majority behave. People are willing to buy cryptocurrencies and don’t mind holding them through centralized third parties like Revolut or Coinbase. They use PayPal for payments.

This is not very encouraging news for decentralization. Essentially, all second layers will compete with centralized services and therefore need to be on a par in terms of ease of use. This will be difficult to achieve if a high level of decentralization is to be maintained. The population is not at all ready for the concept of decentralization and it may take another decade before it is a preferred feature for them.

The authors of specific services will have to decide which parts of their applications must be decentralized and which must not. For example, for games, the most important feature is good gameplay. So the game itself does not need to be stored on the blockchain. However, if it will be possible to earn stable coins or ADA coins in the game, the only thing that matters is that the winners are always actually rewarded and the team or anyone else cannot deprive them of their winnings from a central authority position. It’s easy to imagine card game players locking in their bets before the game starts and the smart contract deciding who to send the winnings to when it’s over. The user interface needs have nothing to do with decentralization or blockchain, as long as it is ensured that no player has any advantage arising from poor game design. We expect that people will trust open-source projects more.

Blockchain has the potential to kick-start entirely new business models. One of the goals of the Cardano project is to enable peer-to-peer lending from people in rich countries towards people in developing countries. People are used to borrowing from friends or from a bank. In recent years, it has become clear that people are willing to lend to each other and Peer-to-Peer lending is on the rise. Identity verification is quite crucial in this business. Unfortunately, people from developing countries often do not have verified identities. This makes it difficult for them to take out a loan. Providing people with a digital identity and enabling them to take out a loan is a goal for Cardano. The Peer-to-Peer lending service will be composed of multiple layers. Services like authentication, stable coins, matching supply and demand, exchanging digital tokens for local currency, transferring value, evaluating the contract between participants, etc. will exist on different layers with different levels of decentralization.

Note that even if participant authentication was completely centralized or requires cooperation with local authorities, the remaining layers can be decentralized. The existence of stable coins, the contract between users, and the transfer of value can be decentralized.

Wait, doesn’t peer-to-peer lending fall more into the realm of DeFi? You’re right, it does. Web3 seeks to give control back to users and allow them to own basically anything that may have value. DeFi is really just a subset of Web3 that focuses on financial services.

# Ownership and decentralization

We have said that the ability to exclusively own or share ownership is a key differentiating feature between Web2 and Web3. Related to this is the ability to create value. What is actually the difference between native blockchain protocol coins such as ADA and other tokens? The only difference is that the Cardano protocol doesn’t allow the existence of more than 45,000,000,000 ADA coins and manages the gradual release of coins into circulation. ADA is used to distribute power in the Cardano ecosystem. Tokens and NFTs can be issued by anyone according to their own rules.

As far as to coin transfer and use in Plutus scripts, the Cardano protocol treats ADA coins exactly the same as tokens. That is, coins and tokens are globally available, no one can censor transactions, as long as users have their own private keys, they have full control over their wealth. This basically means that people can rely on the particular features of the network that come from decentralization and use that to their own advantage.

Does an unchanging monetary policy only make sense for Bitcoin, or is it also important elsewhere? From our perspective, this feature or service is useful in many other places. Cardano has a large user base that is eager to build more advanced decentralized services. For that, they need their own decentralized platform and their own rules. BTC coins cannot be used to implement such a platform in principle. Cardano, therefore, has its own ADA coins, making the network completely independent of Bitcoin’s fate. The same can be said for individual services built on the Cardano platform. Services will be created that have a limited number of users. It makes no sense for a service to be dependent on ADA coins. It’s a smart idea to issue your own tokens for a given project.

What if a country wants to issue its own currency and define its own monetary policy, say, with, say, 4% inflation per year? If the monetary policy is to be immutable, some global network over which no one has control must ensure exactly this. It doesn’t matter what other layers the new coins will be transferred on. What matters is that the rules are followed and unchangeable. Coins can be issued on the Cardano layer, and that includes the rule that 4% of new coins are created each year. What if the state needs to borrow more money in the case of crisis? A rule can be prepared for this eventuality as well. Cardano can lend to the state with the understanding that if the state does not repay on time, the protocol will reduce the annual inflation of new coins adequately.

Notice how elegantly it works. Cardano allows you to define rules that cannot be changed once they are in place. It takes advantage of a decentralized first layer over which no third party has control. Not even the states. Coins or tokens can be used on other layers so they do not burden the Cardano network. The Cardano network will only ensure that the number of coins or tokens does not increase. People can own the coins of a given state, they will be able to verify authenticity easily, but the state will have no control over monetary policy. Users will be able to use the Cardano network to transfer coins at any time, so possible censorship on the second layer makes no sense.

States are unlikely to want to give up control over money, so this example was kind of hypothetical. However, if a group of people in a given location wanted to issue its money, the possibility exists.

The NFT industry uses blockchain to ensure that a given work represents a given token. Ideally, it ensures that the work is indeed from the claimed author and that neither the author nor anyone else subsequently republishes the work. If this happens, it will be very easy to detect. If the author has a digital ID and releases the NFT on the Cardano network, users will be able to verify the origin of the work and the authenticity of the NFT. The artwork, whether a physical image or a representation of a physical object, will be owned by the owner of the NFT, no one else. People will be able to easily distinguish the original from fakes.

Even if anyone in the world makes a copy of the image or even their own NFT, the original NFT will always be traceable and only that will be of the highest value.

People mainly associate NFTs with images, but a token can represent pretty much anything. It doesn’t matter if it’s a digital game, a song, an album, a video, a tweet, access to content, a ticket, or a vote. The important thing is that it has some value to that group of people. It doesn’t have to be economic value and liquidity does not need to be high.

People sometimes mistakenly think that if a token doesn’t grow in market value, it has no value. That is a big mistake. For example, stable coins have stable purchasing power by design. If you want to really own money, not rely on a bank account, and at the same time want to avoid the risk of volatility, you have no choice but to start using stable coins. You will get all the benefits of decentralization and no one will take your money away from you.

Why do the IT giants have so much control over Web2 these days? One of the reasons is that they have a monopoly on the provision of digital identity. This gives them full control over user data and allows them to profit from it. The IT giants know more about you than, say, governments and authorities. They may know more about your habits than you do.

Digital identity is also something that people can take back under their own control. Anyone can stop using the services of the IT giants, including their service of providing IDs to third parties. The reality is that if there is no alternative, no one will do it. The only viable alternative must be built on decentralized technologies. Cardano provides a decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) where records can be instantly authenticated by anyone, anywhere. Moreover, it provides data sharing through secure, private, peer-to-peer communication channels.

People don’t realize how important their identity is in everyday life and how crucial the information associated with it is. Many services and social interactions are built on the basis of the verifiability of the identity of the other party. For the blockchain industry and Web3, the verifiable identity of users is just as important as it is for Web2. The fundamental difference lies, again, in ownership.

# When will we see Web3 services?

Web3 is definitely a relevant effort, but it is hard to predict when we will see wider adoption. The blockchain industry is still in its infancy. We needed more than 10 years from the launch of the first blockchain network to have a more scalable and sustainable PoS consensus. We have other alternatives and that’s a good thing. While technological progress is accelerating, we estimate that the first globally successful Web3 services will emerge in 5–10 years.

Decentralized services need to offer concrete benefits to people. Decentralization is a very powerful concept, but from a marketing perspective, it will never be the reason why people will want to join Web3. Current services have a large user base and a strong network effect. People first need to learn how to use cryptocurrency wallets, which are the gateway to Web3. Fortunately, this is happening. People are installing wallets from different networks and trying to send tokens. However, this is not enough for mass success. Services need to emerge that actually compete with Web2 services. Until decentralized lending is as reliable and visibly cheaper than from a bank, people will remain loyal to the traditional world.

Perhaps all of today’s large companies are watching the blockchain industry and beginning to understand the benefits. This is most evident in the NFT industry. Big companies have not been very interested in using cryptocurrencies as money, so their interest in NFTs is very surprising. Samsung, Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Ubisoft, and many others are looking for ways to leverage NFT. This is not just the hype of some alternative cryptocurrency speculator community. NFT is becoming a serious industry. These big companies will need to integrate their infrastructure with blockchain networks. Efforts by large companies to create their own blockchain will always fail on decentralization. If artists release their NFTs on Cardano and other public networks, IT firms will have no choice but to adapt and settle for the fact that they will never fully own the infrastructure of public networks.

It can be expected that not only IT giants and many startups will start building some services on blockchain networks. However, blockchain networks are often still not ready for the mainstream. The IOG team will need a few more years before Cardano is more scalable. The current enthusiasm may wane and it is possible that the big boom will not happen until 5–10 years from now. However, it is positive to see interest in blockchain networks from both businesses and everyday people.

# Conclusion

Cardano is definitely a good platform to build Web3 services on, as it is one of the most decentralized networks currently. Web3 is essentially all about features that are born out of the principles of decentralization. Cardano has a strong community and there was a fair distribution of ADA coins at the beginning. It’s a community-owned project. These advantages will become increasingly important.

The technological readiness of blockchain networks will be key for Web3 services. IOG is one of the largest teams in the cryptocurrency space. This makes Cardano the most developed project according to GitHub. Technology needs to evolve and decentralized networks are no exception. Cardano is being built to give people back control of their lives. That’s the original vision, and it makes sense to strive to fulfill it. The team will work on Cardano and get it ready for Web3 in a few years.",cryptocurrency,1643979552.0

CryptoCurrency,Nike suing online reseller StockX for selling unauthorized images of Nike shoes as NFT’s,"Feb 3 (Reuters) - Sneaker giant Nike sued online reseller StockX in New York federal court on Thursday for selling unauthorized images of Nike shoes, marking the latest lawsuit over digital assets known as non-fungible tokens.

Nike said StockX's NFTs infringe its trademarks and are likely to confuse consumers. Its lawsuit asked for unspecified money damages and an order blocking their sales.

Detroit-based StockX, a platform for reselling sneakers, handbags and other goods, was valued at more than $3.8 billion last year.

A representative for the company did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Nike or its attorneys.

Nike said StockX last month began selling unauthorized NFTs of its sneakers, telling buyers they would be able to redeem the tokens for physical versions of the shoes ""in the near future.""

The complaint said StockX has sold over 500 Nike-branded NFTs.

The lawsuit said complaints about the NFTs' ""inflated prices and murky terms of purchase and ownership"" and buyers' doubts about the legitimacy of StockX's model have hurt Nike's business reputation.

Nike said it will release ""a number of virtual products"" later this month in conjunction with the digital art studio RTFKT, which it acquired in December.

CryptoCurrency,Why Cosmos is the best crypto ecosystem,"Hello, fellow CC Redditors, 

Just wanted to give my explanation on why I'm super stoked for the Cosmos ecosystem and its future. 

In case you didn't know, Cosmos (ATOM) is a **layer 0 blockchain** system that allows for the development of separate blockchains on top of it (similar to Polkadot but less restricted).

This means not only do you get exposure to the price action of the ATOM token, but you also get exposure from anything built on it using the Tendermint SDK as well. 

It's also one of the most secure networks and less vulnerable to price drops due to the lucrative staking system (frequent airdrops) and 21-day lockup. 

Did I also mention that one of the tokens ([JUNO](https://www.junonetwork.io/) \- Layer 1 network) that is built on Cosmos rewarded its stakers with a $10-15k airdrop recently of NETA tokens, simply for voting on one governance option and having around $300-500 of JUNO staked?

Going forward, networks like JUNO, XPRT (Persistence), and SCRT (Secret) also promise to have more lucrative airdrops in the future and are fairly new meaning the journey is only getting started. 

Cosmos also sees exciting projects like Stargaze, an NFT marketplace, opening up, and of course, we have our own meme coin, Chihuahua (HUAHUA) that offers 500% APR staking (yes you heard that right). 

Basically, by being involved in an ecosystem rather than a single chain, there are far more options for you to grow your money as you're always being exposed to new developments and exciting projects. 

Cosmos also has one of the best transaction settlement times and a high potential TPS, meaning it's also built to be futureproofed. 

Lastly, and probably the most important part of the Cosmos ecosystem, is [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=ATOM&amp;to=OSMO), which is one of the biggest DEX in the world that gives you the ability to swap your ATOM tokens for all these different projects built in the Cosmos ecosystem, in which it's own native token (OSMO) has also seen explosive growth recently. 

You should always have diversity in other projects but ATOM should be a solid part of your portfolio -- not investment advice, DYOR, etc.",cryptocurrency,1643982720.0

Say I'm 60ish and want to start making withdraws to my accounts for retirement.

Say have a large nest egg with both a taxable and non-taxable account.

Say I want to withdraw 100k per year and I'm married and neither of us have W2 income. Just for fun let's assuming it's all gains.

Reviewing the federal tax rates for long term cap gains for 100k, the effective taxes I would pay would 0. 100k minus ~25k (std deduction) = ~75k and anything below 80k has an effective tax rate of 0%.

Reviewing the federal tax rate for an TIRA/401k, if I were to withdraw 100k, it would be the same as income so I would owe roughly 8.5k.

Are my calculations correct? Is it actually more advantageous to pull out of a non-tax advantage account?

I fully understand contributing to TIRA/401k is still advantageous due to the tax write offs, employer match, and non-tax gains over decades.

I don't know much and am learning a lot thanks to this sub. I was wondering how I can do better. Any feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated.

55F making 80K a year. Have a daughter for whom I receive $1500 a month of child support which will end in a year. I have no debt except for a mortgage of 180K with 2.75% interest rate.

My holdings:

**Vanguard taxable brokerage** a little over 300K (being managed by Vanguard - was too scared to do it myself). It consists of 

VTI 30%

VXUS 20%

BND 35%

BNDX 15%

**Vanguard Trad IRA** a little over 20K also being managed by Vanguard, same combination of VTI/VXUS/BND/BNDX.

**Vanguard Roth IRA** about 23K (have been maxing out last 3 years and will continue doing it)

VTSAX 60%

VTIAX 40%

**HYSA** \- about 80K. Cannot bring myself to add this to my taxable brokerage in this volatile market. I am afraid that being 55 I don't have much time to recoup my holdings if things go south.

**I Bonds** 20K

**HSA** 35K (not invested) maxing out and will continue doing it.

**457 plan** about 35K invested in TDF2035. The employer contributes $35 every two weeks. I have been maxing out the last year but not sure I will be able to do it once the child support dries out but will be pretty close to maxing out.

I also purchased about 50K worth of **physical gold** for the sake of diversifying.

I will get paid about 1K a month of government pension when I retire.

I know I started saving very late. I was a stay at home mom for the most of my life and relied on my ex. I am worried I will not be prepared for retirement when the time comes. How can I improve? Any advice? Thank you in advance.",finance,1643994237.0

investing,Vast DOJ Probe Looks at Almost 30 Short-Selling Firms and Allies,"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/vast-doj-probe-looks-at-almost-30-short-selling-firms-and-allies

The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized computers from the home of prominent short seller Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research, in early 2021, some of the people said. In more recent months, the Justice Department subpoenaed certain market participants seeking communications, calendars and other records relating to almost 30 investment and research firms, as well as three dozen individuals associated with them, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential inquiries.

Many on that roster -- a veritable who’s-who of the activist short-selling realm -- said they haven’t been contacted directly by the government, leaving some exasperated about being left in the dark. Reached for comment, Left also said he’s frustrated.

“It’s very tough to defend yourself when you haven’t been accused of anything,” Left said. “I’m cooperating and I have full faith in the system and the First Amendment,” he added, referencing protections on free speech.

The long list of names underscores the breadth of the Justice Department investigation first described by Bloomberg in December and shows how authorities are trying to map out alliances and understand how short sellers handle research and arrange bets that stocks will fall. It remains unclear which, if any, of the names mentioned in subpoenas might be targets of the inquiry or merely have ties to other people or entities of interest.

The Securities and Exchange Commission also has sent some requests for information, people with knowledge of those inquiries said. Spokespeople for the Justice Department and SEC declined to comment. No one has been accused of wrongdoing, and in many cases, the opening of a probe doesn’t lead to anyone facing charges.

Prominent firms and their leaders mentioned in the Justice Department’s requests to some market participants include Melvin Capital Management and founder Gabe Plotkin; Orso Partners and Nate Koppikar; Sophos Capital Management and Jim Carruthers; as well as Kerrisdale Capital Management. The list also includes well-known researchers such as Nate Andersonand his Hindenburg Research, as well as Fraser Perring and his Viceroy Research.

One area of focus is how investors set up their bets that stocks will decline. Investigators have been looking, for example, for signs that money managers might try to engineer startling stock drops to induce selling by market makers or other investors, or engage in other abuses, such as insider trading, people familiar with the matter have said.",finance,1643998221.0

Info from my W2's

Job 1

Wages: 18535.33

Individually each W2 gives me a large refund (1500-2000) but together I get zilch. I understand this can happen if you work two concurrent jobs throughout the year but in my case, there is no overlap; I quit one job and then started the other. What gives? I'm in the same tax bracket, did not change my allowances and have no other untaxed income to speak of. About the only difference between the two positions is that the latter provides free health insurance through BCBS and has a Teachers Retirement System plan I was forced to opt into.

My choices are a ""Bond Fund"" and a ""Bond Index Fund"".  In either case, any dividends get reinvested as more shares.  The only way I will draw money is to sell a portion of my shares.

My question regards timing of purchasing a bond fund.  **Is it better to buy now or wait until interest rates go up?**  I'll be selling from a mid-cap stock fund which is down 10% from a high last November, but still well up from a year ago. 

It's not clear to me if purchase timing for bond funds or bond index funds should be different from purchasing bonds themselves.  Based on my options it looks like the managed fund performs better than the index even though expenses are higher.

defi,"DeFi to TradFi interest rate differences: sustainable, for how long?","I'm a former economist working on a crypto interest rate POV. 

Can anyone help me explain what sustains the large interest rate gap between DeFi and TradFi (e.g., crypto stablecoin deposits are paying 10%+ and deposits at US banks are paying &lt;1%)?

In particular, if you think about this like international economics (suppose TradFi and DeFi are countries), capital should flow to the country (or in this case 'type of finance') with the highest interest rates. Overtime, as capital flows to DeFi, rates should fall, while in TradFi, rates should rise.

In addition to what is sustaining the gap, I'm wondering, how long before the gap closes / collapses? In particular, will a US Fed CBDC cause this to happen (e.g., banks can now start to borrow a crypto currency from the Fed at 0.25% and start to offer cheap capital in DeFi)?

personalfinance,8+ years of unsubmitted tax returns,"Hi everyone,

I 'have never submitted a tax return despite having a full time job (W-2) for about 7.5 years, but recently decided to get my life in order at the age of 30 and finished preparing these tax returns. I did a good amount of research and used a tax software to complete these returns, but was hoping to get confirmation that I am taking all the right steps before I mail in the returns.

I have a very simple tax return. My sources of income are a full time job right after college (W-2) from late 2013 to present day (between $50k to $90k in annual income), and an investment account since around 2000 (between $1k and $3k in annual income). After completing my tax returns from 2014-2020, I see I am owed federal refunds for all years (I know I can only collect on the last 3 years), but owe minimal state taxes on 2 years.

I should also mention that I am in process of completing the CPA exams (I do realize the irony here, though I don't work in tax) and need to be in good standing with the IRS before I apply for my certification. 

Below are the questions I was hoping to get clarification on:

1. On FreeTaxUSA, I can only fill out tax returns from 2014-2021 which I completed. When I asked why, they said that you only have to submit the last 6 years of returns to be in good standing with the IRS, and they added a 7th year for good measure. Should I only submit the returns from 2015 to 2021 (6 years), or should I also submit 2014? I started working in late 2013 and only earned about $17k that year; do I need to complete a manual return for that year too, since FreeTaxUSA doesn't service that year?
2. Before 2013, I had a few internships and summer jobs for 3 years during college, and earned income from my investment account. I'm conservatively estimating that I earned no more than approximately $3.5k from the summer jobs per year, and about $1k-$3k from the investment account per year. I was claimed as a dependent by my parents, but as far as they recall, they did not submit tax returns for me, nor did I. From my understanding, had I filed a tax return, I wouldn't owe taxes since these amounts are below the standard deduction at the time. Do I need to submit tax returns from 2012 and prior? Or is this something I should discuss with the IRS? Would I really need to file tax returns from when I was about 10?
3. Is there anything else I should know or do? I am planning on sending these returns via certified mail, one year per envelope, to the IRS and state tax authorities, as soon as possible. I believe the last thing I will have to do is wait until my state sends me a bill for a penalty due to two years that I owed state taxes. Am I missing anything?

He said he didn’t care about that and doesn’t want me filing my own taxes yet. I’m not sure how they work, but he claims he can do it all myself.

CryptoMarkets,Microlending Opportunities for SME's and Start-Up Entrepreneurs.,"""Getting loans as an SME or small-scale entrepreneur has always been difficult.  This is why  the concept of Microloans/Microlending is very impressive and even altruistic. Microlending is the act of granting small loans (microloans) to those in financial need. These loans are generally used by entrepreneurs with a business idea or SME’s who need extra cash to expand their business. 

They can range from $20 – $1000 and have extremely affordable interest rates (or in some cases no interest rate) and terms. The main goal of microlending is to help entrepreneurs who would otherwise be unable to borrow money to launch or expand their businesses, thereby reducing poverty in impoverished areas. 

Today’s microlending system involves a website like suku.world, investors, (a microlender that lends to borrowers in a particular location like a financial institution such as a small NGO or large commercial bank), and a borrower. Investors browse the microlending website for one or more people or ideas in which they may want to invest. The microlending website collects the funds and channels them to the borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location.

 The borrower then invariably pays back the microloan with interest.
The most impressive feature of Microlending for me is the fact that micro-lending organizations also actively participate in the training of entrepreneurs on how to run successful businesses. This benefits both microlender and borrower because it improves the borrower’s intellect while also helping to ensure that the borrower will make enough profit to pay back their loan.""",cryptocurrency,1644010162.0

Edit: As some questions are coming I wanted to clarify some things.

1. Unfortunately this was the webpage the link took me. I thought it was a legitimate website as it has most of the commonly used wallets here. I entered my private key to connect, that was the stupidest thing I could do. Now the scammer can access my wallet anytime, anywhere.

2. They withdrew 0.63 ETH and 4 AVAX from my wallet (0x9Ef49E1679725369E715B1A74578875A3b08F3F2) to theirs (0xdf1e45e10bdcfe904136007965db80d9e9703c3d)

3. Rest of the loss occurred as they liquidated my positions on Trader Joe. The total position was over $30k, mostly on USDC.e/AVAX pool and I lent about $10k worth AVAX.

I can't track what happened to these positions. These holdings weren't transferred to the scammer's wallet and there are no activity signatures I could see.

4. OK someone helped me on the discord and a transaction almost $30k in USDC was made couple minutes ago from Scammer's wallet (0xf8d0abd9f5f84ab70db2be5f9896f199bc6e25a00e72489a3e1492d56649ed96) to 0xd186062a1d99458982283269e3f54981c841a7c7

Transaction hash: 0xf8d0abd9f5f84ab70db2be5f9896f199bc6e25a00e72489a3e1492d56649ed96

There are 2 transactions equaling to 47,788.71 USDC ( 29,676.73 - 25 mins ago and 18,111.99 - 15 days 21 hours ago)

Edit 5: A redditor commented that the scammer's wallet was funded by Binance multiple times. I contacted Binance and even though they didn't share account details with me, they helped me file a IC3 Crime to Federal Bureau of Investigation and I think they will coordinate with them after they make an official application. Very likely that the scammer is a KYC'ed member of Binance and legal authorities will be able to get ahold.

Edit 6: Interestingly, I had noticed something in the scammer's wallet. There was multiple back-and-forth transfers between burcakdolanay.eth and that name just caught my eye as I'm Turkish too.

I'm a US resident but a Turkish citizen, so I also have filed a criminal report in Turkey after noticing this. I don't want to point fingers to that person, but it was weird that they had a back-and-forth multiple transactions in those wallets.

Edit 7: Many people are asking what I was multitasking with. I am in interviewing process with multiple companies and I was preparing for an interview that was yesterday afternoon.

Edit 8: I'm finding new information all the time. burcakdolanay.eth was sold to the scammer's wallet on December 24.

retirement,Retirement question,"So I think something finally clicked for me and I’m hoping someone can confirm, correct, or elaborate on my understanding. 

Using 2022 federal tax brackets as an example:

$0-20k is taxed at 10%. 
$20k- 83k Is taxed at 12% 
then it jumps up to 22%+ etc

So, in retirement, (depending on goals/lifestyle) I think the idea is to withdraw from the 401k for dollars zero to ~$80k and only pay 12% in taxes. THEN Withdraw from the Roth for dollars &gt;80k and avoid paying 22%+ in taxes? 

I think that's the idea?? Makes sense to me as a strategy anyway? If my understanding is correct/on the right track, what is this strategy called and can someone point me in the right direction so I can deepen my understanding?

I'd like to consider myself a fairly frugal person, but I easily fall into the trap of ""good deals"" and a few dollars here and there unexpectedly piling up. My finances are a major stressor in my life, and it's too embarrassing for me to talk about with my financially stable/wealthy family members, so I would like to hear any useful, knowledgeable advice that you guys might have for me*.

**Monthly Income**: **$4000**

**Unavoidable Monthly Expenses:**

* Mortgage: **$1400**
* Car Payment: **$400**
* Utilities/Medicine/Other living expenses: roughly **$500**

And with my current monthly credit card payments (up to $150 per card)....

....I'm financially screwed. I can't build up my savings. Every time I think I'm doing good, an unexpected/unlucky expense comes up.

I’m very new to Reddit and posting questions online in general so apologies in advance if this is a redundant question or posted in the incorrect place.

My question: 

I’ve always wondered how it’s possible for a lender to provide a locked 30 year rate mortgage at, as an example, 2%. 

If the rate of inflation goes above 2% then wouldn’t that security (mortgage/note) be worthless?

Even if it’s a hard money lender who gave the loan, if the rate of inflation exceeds the locked in annual interest rate than wouldn’t the lender lose money every year? 
.
If that’s the case with a lot of long term loans being given at insanely low rates like 1.75% would the banks collapse? Who would then buy the note? How can they buy the note if it’s essentially worthless?",finance,1644036826.0
personalfinance,Which student loan balance makes the most sense to apply a small lump sum to?,"So, I have about $80k in student loan debt left. I made a promise to myself to really focus on chipping away at it as much as I possibly can this year while my income is good and steady.

Between the amount I am getting back from my federal tax refund and some extra unexpected money from last year’s state unemployment, I have a small lump sum that I would like to apply to one of my loan balances. My issue now is that I can't decide which loan balance is the better option to put this lump sum towards.

1st Loan: Federal. It’s the big one; the majority of the total student loan debt. Right now, it has a 0% interest rate until May 2022. I am on an income-contingent repayment plan due to the pandemic. Despite the fact that payments aren't required until May, I have been making payments since last month- trying to take advantage of the 0% interest.

2nd Loan: Private. Smaller amount, but still significant in the 5 digit range. The interest rate is the worst part of this loan -11.38% since I took it out. It was sold to a secondary servicer last year, so there is no chance of me being able to adjust the interest rate unless I refinance. 

3rd option: I have two credit cards that got “out of control” (at least for my standards) during the pandemic. I have since stopped using them both and am slowly paying off the balances, but this lump sum could bring at least one of them down to $0. My side goal is to get back into the habit of paying off my entire CC debt every month and to never let it snowball again. 

4th option: Split it up between all accounts? At the point, it seems less satisfying or helpful. I’d rather focus on one that's giving me the most trouble.

Which is the smartest option? Completely open to any advice. Thank you!

stocks,Meta's tough road ahead,"Disclosure - I own no stocks of Meta nor do I hold any short positions.

Firstly, yes hindsight is 20/20 and you're absolutely right in asking why wouldn't I write this post before the Meta crash occurred? But, even ignoring the recent crash, I do believe that Meta's time has come and it will dwindle far faster than most other stocks will.

Almost all tech stocks have crashed ever since the US fed turned hawkish with regard to its monetary policy, Netflix, Tesla, Meta, they're all down. But I do think the party for Meta is over. I will mostly be wrong because Mark Zuckerberg is not the kind of guy you want to bet against  but anyways, here I go.

The fall in DAU - What has spooked investors the most in the latest earnings call is the fall in DAU which stands for Daily Active Users. Ever since Meta's inception as Facebook, its DAU has always been growing but the  latest quarter marked the first quarter when Meta's DAU has fallen. This  is problematic because most of the ad based companies essentially  depend on an ever larger growing base of consumers whom they can serve  to advertisers. Lower DAU means lower consumers which means lower ad  revenue.

There are two ways to grow DAU - either organically or inorganically

Facebook has always managed to grow DAU either organically or inorganically but I feel this will no longer be possible.

The organic route - Facebook could go about this in two ways.

First,  they launch a new form of social media platform or a new social media  experience. A newer social media experience will require a newer form of  hardware to be truly different in the current world saturated with  various social media apps and Facebook understands that. Their  acquisition of Oculus and rebranding to Meta shows how serious the  company is about AR and VR. But the fact remains that there isn't a  single mass market AR/VR device yet. There is also no tangible evidence  that a fully functional mass market AR/VR device is gonna hit the market  anytime soon. Unless that happens, bringing about a truly different  social media experience is not gonna be possible. With smartphone as the  hardware base, all forms of social media experiences have been tapped  out with TikTok coming out with the most innovative social media format  (yes I know the content on TikTok is cringe but the format was  revolutionary and went on to hook millions of users).

Second,  they just plain hope that upcoming teens willingly sign up for Facebook  or its various existing properties. The truth is that none of this is  happening. Social media is kind of like a cafe. Every kid only wants to  go to the coolest cafe in town and no one wants to go to the second  coolest cafe. The fact is Facebook has been the least coolest cafe on  the internet for quite some time now. The core Facebook app is barely  used by teens. Instagram is still doing well but faces tough competition  from a resurgent Snapchat and even TikTok. The only other Facebook  property with a large user base is WhatsApp but Facebook has been unable  to monetize WhatsApp at all. They initially had plans to make WhatsApp  work like WeChat but that never panned out because of issues with NPCI  in India. The most low hanging fruit for Facebook right now is to insert  ads between WhatsApp stories and make some money off of that. But that  is literally the ONLY organic way left for Facebook to grow its  revenues. No wonder people aren't feeling too optimistic about a company  whose only growth arena left untapped is ads between stories of a  messenger app predominantly used in developing nations.

The  inorganic route - This mostly involves acquisitions. Both Instagram and  WhatsApp weren't developed by Meta, however, Meta bought them and  monetized one of them (Instagram) while relying on the second to  significantly boost its DAU (WhatsApp). Things are no longer the same as  they were when Meta bought WhastApp and Instagram. Meta could just  acquire TikTok and solve its DAU issue but no antitrust agency in  developed worlds will allow that. Most anyhow call for the current  Facebook to be broken up and would in no way entertain this company  becoming even bigger and even more embedded in people's lives.  Meta was  very lucky that because of geopolitical reasons TikTok was banned in  India, else TikTok was eating Instagram's market share in India like  there was no tomorrow.

So, yes,  this is why I am bearish on Meta but Zuckerberg isn't a man who gives up  easily. The fact that he managed to keep Meta relevant for so long when  its competitors like Google Plus, Orkut, MySpace etc died at a much  younger age speaks to that guy's competency more than anything else. He  might once again pull a rabbit out of his hat but the chances seem  increasingly bleak to most people.

No. Everything is fucking not okay.

I do have student loans and a car loan, after taxes and all bills and expenses I can usually save 300-500 a month, but have been worried about losing my job after the trauma from the covid layoff so have been building up a buffer savings. I have considered consolidating many times, but just never pull the trigger. Need to understand what is best. How do I get out of this loop?

  
I never use these cards, and I am single making 80k so I have a 3 month expenses buffer saved up over the last 6 months or so in case of job loss (lost my job due to corona and that put me back at square 1, started working again 6 months ago) . No worries about racking up more debt on the cards if i consolidate them, just don't know what my best option is. Seems like paying those minimums is getting me nowhere, but the idea of this huge consolidation loan also feels terrifying.",finance,1644048593.0
CryptoCurrency,Why I believe we are all still a decade early to crypto.,"This post is a serious one I made after reading this article. \[ [https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) \] 

&gt;Shout out to Moxie for actually talking about how shit has just become super overcomplicated for coders to even begin to get into. This article is probably the best critique of the current crypto space I've ever read \^

We have these ideas of immutable, trustless, decentralized platforms but most of them have become mutable and centralized with all trust put in the hands of a few servers.

Cardano, for example, the fact that [sundaeswap took 6 months to release and it's not even fully ready yet](https://cryptosrus.com/cardstarter-and-sundaeswap-a-falling-out-story/) …[plus looking like they rugged cardstarter](https://coin.fyi/news/cardano/cardstarter-and-every-single-project-it-has-launched-smells-of-a-scam-nmrfpt), it’s not a good look!

""Trustless"" doesn't make sense when there's still just a team of greedy humans on the other end of single phone line. I recall when my friends where first getting into crypto a few months ago, best believe it wasn't *‘for the tech’*, it was pure greed, they were aping hundreds into doggy coins hoping to make millions out of thin air. 

Arweave, which was made to solve the issue of NFTs being backed by on centralized servers, is still putting trust in the hands of others, so it's not exactly ""trustless"" and things can still be flagged for deletion and stuff like that. 

[https://www.arweave.org/technology](https://www.arweave.org/technology)  = *""Finally, those that maintain gateways (the servers you will likely use to view the permaweb) can also apply content moderation policies to further safeguard their users.""*

It's tricky though, like if you have permanent jpeg storage on a truly immutable permanent server what about criminal abuse material and other f’ed up stuff like that from being put on there ‘for good’? That's why Arweave has a democratic processes for removal of content if it's deemed necessary, but the problem is it's SLOW! 

Just like Cardano, just like ETH, and Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and so on. All these truly decentralized things are slow as shit.

**Compare the time it takes to load this:** [https://audius.co/neonanesthetics](https://audius.co/neonanesthetics) 

**With this:** [https://open.spotify.com/artist/4h3dx3iH28dTFooTspQqxd](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4h3dx3iH28dTFooTspQqxd)

This just really highlights the sheer magnitude of the blockchain trilemma: **Low Cost, Speed, Decentralization. Pick 2.**

I still believe in crypto, but if this doesn't make you think...I've always said there will probably be a dominant cryptocurrency in the future that solves all of these issues, but less and less am I thinking it will be any networks available today. 

It will likely be built upon 6G network protocols, or some similar competing concept; 6G will basically mishmash the current 5G super-speed, satellite based internet, to that of the internet of things, peer2peer data transfer, and blockchain(s). 

Here's a journal article from last summer: *Blockchain and 6G: The Future of Secure and Ubiquitous Communication* [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05673.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05673.pdf)  = *""the trustless nature of blockchain would make it easier to manage and audit 3D network resources and AI model parameters in 6G networks.""*

Another example, in Windows update there's this:

[Microsoft Windows Update Delivery Optimization](https://preview.redd.it/jfd16glvkzf81.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8119e238830ba28eba85c150763a516e13c85373)

Now extrapolate that concept out to creating the blockchain and the internet itself, not just simple data transfer - it'll be a mix of current cell-tower tech sped up a thousand-fold by decentralizing server loads through peer2peer means, encrypted, and under consensus - all while having latency speeds measured in single digit milliseconds!

Here is a latency test of my internet to google: Top is with VPN routed through Portugal : Bottom is without VPN.

[Ping Command to Test Your Network](https://preview.redd.it/szcppeg2lzf81.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ae7a88e08ba577ff67785c362d5beba976f4b17)

We need speeds 1 order of magnitude faster than the current best case scenario technologies, and 2 orders of magnitude faster than what's the more ""practical"" speeds we're used to. 

To conclude this spiel, **I think we're about a decade away from this all.** Till then, I am still having fun learning about money, economics, fiancé, decentralization issues, network effects, but less and less am I feeling married to any single current network/blockchain because they all seem to be unable to carry the load that will weigh on future technological shoulders.",cryptocurrency,1644055091.0

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto from an Analyst's Perspective - Part 3 - ""We've crossed the Rubicon""","Good Morning Everyone - 

For those of you who don't know me - I work at a large financial firm that not only deals with investment research, but provides financial software to financial institutions across the country. Our main products are literally the backbone of banking in the country. I myself provide research and recommendations to our C-level. I say this not to brag, but to give legitimacy to the insights I like to share with this community! With that, here are some wonderful happenings in the financial world when it comes to crypto:  


\#1) Research that my firm has done and that we have backed up with outside research shows that Crypto has officially broke into the top 10 most important topics of 2022 for **community FIs** . Why is this important? Because community banks are not JPM or Morgan Stanley. Community FIs are the regional banks and credit unions that serve the everyday person. This means we are seeing grassroots demand all over the country (US) and that demand is being noticed by a group of people that are normally hesitant to change due to the time/money cost that smaller institutions have trouble shouldering at times. Most of the demand is simply for buy/hold/sell capabilities and will most likely only start with BTC and **maybe** ETH, but, hey, it's a start right? To me, this is huge because it will increase the liquidity in the crypto market and the number of eyes watching crypto as a whole. Ideally, this leads to less volatility and more analysis done on coins, which helps sniff out shitcoins and rugpulls. 

\#2) If you do ANYTHING to educate yourself, read this: [https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf](https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf) Messari is a very well-respected crypto analysis firm. This 165 page document should be your holy text for 2022. They talk about everything - potential regulation, trends they see coming, their favorite coins, etc. And it covers every topic you could think of DeFi, Web 3.0, Staking, NFTs, American/European regulation, literally everything. I respect this firm a lot and engorge myself on their research whenever I can. You should always try to be more informed than the average investor and this is a great start. 

\#3) Regulation is LOOMING. Everyone and their mother started trading crypto for the first time in 2020, which means 2021 will be the first year that potentially millions of people report crypto assets on their taxes for the first time. This will absolutely grab the attention of Congress, the IRS, and the SEC, who will not wait to pounce in any way they can. In a less sinister view, we have seen an abnormally high number of hacks the last 12 months, along with rugpulls/shitcoins that are targeting people with more money than sense (Look up the whole Squid Game Coins debacle, great example of this). A lot of advocacy groups and even crypto exchanges understand that if people keep getting burned this fast, it will hurt mainstream adoption and legitimacy of crypto, so they are calling on Congress to do **something**. In a similar vein, the Fed actually finally released their report on a US Digital Dollar here - [https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf). While only 40 pages, it is incredibly dry (trust me, I had to read the whole thing). In essence, the Fed has not taken a stance on whether a Digital Dollar makes sense yet, but lays out the pros and cons and mentions it will take a lot of coordination in the government to do it right, laying the foundation for a US CBDC, but also a lot more regulation. 

I think I'll stop here. I could literally go on for hours about this. Please let me know if this interests you and I can post more! In my line of work, I do research and give recommendations to all size of investment banks, community banks, private equity, and have even been fortunate enough to speak directly with the Fed a few times. I figure I can use this to help inform and expand a community I love! 

Also, because I ALWAYS get this question, here are my holdings, in no particular order (In fact, I am going to do them out of order on purpose to avoid giving any special weight to a single coin).

 Disclaimer: I hold more types of coins than the average person because I like to have small stakes in any coin I research, because it helps me follow their price action and any news:

solar,Solar financing - is this predatory lending?,"I am new to residential solar system shopping. In my search for a solar system, it has become apparent that there is a solar industry finance machine that is disturbing (at least from my perspective as a bank finance professional). I thought it was just the installers I talked to, but realized it seems like an industry wide practice. 

I was given a quote during a face to face sales meeting that a 5.6 kW solar system would cost $30,050 and that could be financed at 1.99%. He said cash is an option, but never said what kind of discount for the cash price (or more accurately all the extra items added to the cash price). The cash price is $21,300.

Think about this in the auto industry? The housing industry? Would this type of lending exist? There are truth in lending disclosures that explain to the consumer clearly all the terms of financing.

I think the most egregious parts that may not be apparent is the fact that the market interest rate for these long term loans in 5% or higher. All these 1.99% rates require an interest rate buy down which increases the amount of the loan. You pay the interest rate up front with this amount added to the cash price, and you receive a lower interest rate. Anyone who does not make the minimum payments for 25 years does not get the full benefit of buying the interest rate down. These companies are saying you can use the tax rebate to pay down the loan, but are charging you the buy down rate on the full amount of the loan! 

(Removed statement that solar companies earn % of loan, as corrected by those familiar with industry)

I’m all for allowing people to choose financial products and for products to be offered to people of all financial situations, but consumers should be aware of exactly what they are choosing. In this relatively new industry, it seems like predatory like practices have become an industry accepted practice.

CryptoCurrency,Mimas Finance: Cronos Lending Platform (and lending strategies),"[Mimas Finance](https://mimas.finance/) is the second largest lending protocol on Cronos, a newer blockchain put out by the spare no expense in marketing, Crypto.com. Cronos is a young blockchain that is just starting to develop its decentralized finance field. If you are familiar with the Harmony ONE network, you might notice that Mimas Finance looks a lot like Tranquil Finance. This is because the same team is behind both projects and instead of having a multi chain lending protocol, they have decided to fork out Tranquil Finance and make a new platform. One of the main reasons they have chosen to do this is to use all the knowledge around tokenomics they learned from Tranquil Finance and apply them to Mimas.   

## Tokenomics

One of the fundamental issues with many lending protocols is that they have inflationary tokenomics without a great staking or burning solution for their token.  A large percentage of people in lending protocols sell their rewards they earn soon after they are earned and it is easier than ever to automate this. There are three main ways that lending protocols employ to provide utility for their token

&amp;#x200B;

* Allow users to stake the token to earn a higher interest rate for lending or staking their assets.
* Governance, allowing the owner to vote on how rewards are allocated
* Provide direct rewards for staking. Frequently this also includes part of the protocol fees. This type of rewards does not increase the interest rate you receive for lending on the protocol.

Mimas Finance uses a two token system, MIMAS and rMIMAS. MIMAS is the active token on the protocol and the one with the most liquidity. rMIMAS are locked MIMAS. Unlike some other locked tokens rMIMAS are actual tokens that are put in your wallet when you earn them. You can redeem your rMIMAS for MIMAS and after 6 months they become fully unlocked MIMAS.

Mimas Finance allows you to stake your MIMAS to earn rewards. They allow you to lock your rewards for a 6 month period and in addition to the normal staking rewards, to earn a share of 75% of the protocol fees earned by Mimas Finance. This mechanism takes the Mimas out of the pool of tokens that can be sold and helps stabilize the price. You can also stake your rMIMAS to earn more rMIMAS. The emissions on the rMIMAS vault are higher\* than the MIMAS vault, this provides incentive to keep them locked. These two mechanism are great for reducing the number of MIMAS that are on the market and can be sold. It allows for higher than normal rewards, but less inflationary selling pressure.

The team behind Mimas and Tranquil Finance has put a lot of thought into how to provide tokenomics that are rewarding, but also have long term stability that minimizes the selling pressure on MIMAS after it earns. The team is in the process of introducing Defira. Defira is a game that involve the Mimas Finance and Tranquil Finance ecosystem. There is a team of over 20 people working on Defira to produce a game that is fun and addicting to play. Defira will provide utility for the tokens outside of just being a lending platform. 

More details on Defira are coming out on a weekly basis. It is initially going to start with greater integration with Tranquil Finance and TRANQ, but transition to include Mimas Finance. Since such a larger percentage of MIMAS is locked for at least 6 months as rMIMAS, the team has some time to integrate Mimas Finance with Defira. This integration will help provide a true utility for MIMAS. Even if you are not a fan on games, you don't need to play the game to use the lending protocol and it provides a true use outside of the lending protocol for MIMAS.

## Lending

Mimas Finance is the second largest lending platform on Cronos. It functions like most other lending platforms. You deposit a token and earn interest on that deposit. A portion of the interest is paid in the token that is deposited, MIMAS, and rMIMAS. The interest earned can be claimed at any time, as often as you want. 

You then can use your deposit as collateral and borrow against it. You pay interest to borrow, but you gain MIMAS and rMIMAS rewards that offset the cost of borrowing. If the borrow interest rate is above zero, you gain more MIMAS and rMIMAS rewards than the interest that you spend. The borrow and rewards APR is not fixed. The total amount that is borrowed and the utilization percentage impact the rates. 

### How Does Lending and Borrowing Work

&amp;#x200B;

* You deposit a token and then click the option to use it as collateral. 
* You then can borrow a certain percentage of the amount that you deposited. This amount varies by the token that you deposited, many are 60%
* If the amount that you are borrowing increases above that limit a user can “liquidate” your assets  
   * Liquidating your assets is where someone repays the amount that you borrowed to get under the borrowing limit.  110% of the amount that you are over your limit is used to bring you within your limit. The platform and the person liquidating you split the 10% as profit. The [liquidity page](https://app.mimas.finance/liquidity) shows all liquidation options that are available.
   * If you borrow the same asset that you deposit it is hard to get liquidated since the percentage that you borrow will be the same regardless of price movement. If you borrow an asset that goes up greater than the collateral you are at risk of liquidation. If your collateral decreases in value more than your borrowed asset, your risk of liquidation increases.
* The common strategy is to deposit, borrow, deposit the amount that was borrowed, and complete the cycle several times with the same asset. This carries a very low risk of liquidation while giving you leverage.

**Currently if you lend $1000 USDC, borrow $590, and lend that $590 you will be earning an APR of \~70% (rough numbers) of a combination of MIMAS and rMIMAS. Your borrow and lending interest of USDC will roughly cancel themselves out. You can do the cycle more to have greater rewards and the numbers work for $100 or $10000, the $1000 is just a random number and I started with much less when I started defi.**

## Conclusion

There are many decentralized finance lending and borrowing protocols out there. Mimas Finance is a great option on Cronos. It provides rewards that are far greater than the industry norm, but provides a short term and long term mechanism to prevent rapid inflation in the ecosystem and a decrease in the price of MIMAS. 

**Is this a shill for Mimas Finance. Yes, but it is more of a shill for defi and lending protocols in general. Like all of defi risks include protocol hacks, stablecoins depegging, and a massive drop in crypto in a very short period of time. The team has put out multiple products on Harmony ONE including the first liquid staking token and I think the chance of a rugpull by the team is very low (they have over 300 million in deposited assets on Harmony ONE)**",cryptocurrency,1644077273.0
investing,Are we in the second shoulder?,"It seems that we're quite possibly forming the second shoulder of the [**head and shoulders pattern**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp). Zoom out to a year on QQQ and the shape is quite apparent, and in a more attenuated form in SPX and the total market as well. 

There's the usual chatter as to the forces currently at work from both analysts and market participants, including here. I must say that as a non-expert retail investor who reads regularly, it definitely seems that sentiment, at least, has changed; the permabull stuff is dying away. 

Thoughts? The head-and-shoulders pattern is thought to be one of the most reliable technical indicators. We have a lot of attempts to rally in meme stocks like TSLA, but they seem to be losing ground. 

A related but important question is, if we are to see the second shoulder, what comes after? So far the Fed's interference, er, guiding hand has largely softened and protracted what would otherwise have been sharper corrections for a clearly overextended market. So far we haven't seen margin calls and other accelerants on a large scale. The fact we haven't reached that tipping point doesn't mean it's impossible or unlikely, but it's hard to assess.

**ETA: For those who like to baselessly claim widespread debunking of TA or that there's no evidence for the head-and-shoulders pattern, you are simply incorrect--please contribute to the discussion but without simple conclusive dismissals.** For example, see:

personalfinance,Should I buy an EV or lease now and buy in a few years?,"I need a new car in the next 6 months and have been pretty set on not buying another gas vehicle, but with all the variables I'm having a hard time deciding what route to go.

If I buy now I capitalize on federal and state tax credits but miss out on rapidly evolving EV technology. For instance, the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 can charge from 10%-80% in 18 minutes on a fast charger. I imagine we'll see more of that as well as other advancements in the next few years. It will also allow time for automakers to work out kinks that come with new models. I also think prices will come down slightly as more competition comes to market. Speaking of price, it seems like every dealership has market markups which I have a very hard time accepting.

All of that leads me to lease an EV for a few years and then reassess the market. But I can't get past the idea of paying for something for 2-3 years and having no ownership of it. I would be 75% through an auto loan at that point. Also, there's no guarantee that federal and state tax credits will still be the same in the future. I imagine the resale market on a 3 year old EV will still be good.

The last thing I've considered is buying an old 150K+ mile Corolla, Civic, or similar for a few grand. I have no problem driving that for a few years and then trading in.

It seems like buying now locks in tax credits at the expense of missing out on rapidly expanding technology. At the same time dealer markups wipe out most of the tax savings anyways.

defi,Potential pitfall for shorting USDT,"I've seen lots of defiers touting the strategy for shorting USDT through Aave and I'm wondering if they've missed a key consideration.

In case you're not familiar with this strategy, it goes something like this:

1. Deposit collateral on a lending dApp like Aave.
2. Borrow USDT against your deposits on Aave with the expectation that Tether will someday lose its peg and become worthless.
3. Exchange borrowed USDT for some other asset to make more $.

A potential hole in this strategy is the fact that the interest rate for USDT fluctuates based on the amount of USDT reserves on Aave.  In the event of a run on Tether, I would expect the following sequence of events:

1. Tether holders sell as much USDT as they can to recover losses which means depleting lending reserves like those on Aave.
2. As reserves of USDT approach zero, the borrow rate on Aave approaches .......a higher number?  Infinity?
3. As the borrow rate approaches infinity, some amount of collateral is liquidated to pay for your deficit.

If this liquidation event comes to pass, I wonder how accurately the liquidation mechanism would work to reconcile the deficit.  For example, if the rate skyrockets, and the protocol believes that your LTV has gone over the limit, the real cost of paying off your debt may now be pretty inconsequential but I believe that there is also a liquidation fee.

I just don't know enough to understand how this last part would play out and was hoping someone else could clarify.",cryptocurrency,1644097720.0

 I currently owe $8,440 on my car. It's a 2019 Fiesta and I did a 72 month lease because at the time I was stupid and didn't make good money. My monthly payments are $240 and the interest rate is a painful 11.7%. There are 44 remaining payments.

The financial situation I will be in after purchase will be like so. I have never owned a house and am going from a rent of 850 a month.

I will move into my new home with a total of around 1400 a month total (principle PMI taxes home insurance etc)

I will have around 26k left in the bank after closing.(closing costs and down payment are being factored into the mortgage as part of a first time home buyer program I have to explain this a lot so just be aware I already know I will have 26k left in the bank) This program is called 105% financing closing costs and 3% down payment are essentially partnered as a second loan. This program gives us a lower interest rate for the mortgage. So we are essentially 1300 for the home(97% loan 200k home) plus 100 a month to cover the second mortgage(3% down payment plus closing costs). Before you tell me that is not a thing or argue the details, it is it is part of a first time home buyer program with my credit union.  Thus 1400 a month. Already have these numbers from pre-approval of loan plus home insurance quote.

I do have one issue out property taxes we are told will be around 240 a month. This sounds like a lot. Someone has mentioned homestead exemption to me. I don't know what that is. I live in Florida Pasco County. If anyone could give me some insight on this that would also be appreciated.

My fiancé and I gross 5300 a month. We only have 1 car it is paid off, we share a phone so only 1 phone bill and work completely from home for a big company. Do not have or plan to have kids. I have worked at this big company for 2 years and am the highest performer(our numbers are tracked for what we do) in my office and fiancé has worked there for 8 years(does a different kind of job). I feel secure at this job. I make 15.50. She makes 18 something. We both started at 12 an hour.

We do rescue cats so they spend some of our money but I was able to save up the 26k in just 2 years almost exactly (started in October 2020) working at my current job.(Did pay for about 2k of an eye surgery, car repairs(1800), animal care(1500) in that time span, bought 2 guitars(2k) and recording gear(800) in the past 2 years((So I know I can save money as I saved  lot and wasted some))).

We haven't fully locked in have to go through inspection process etc can still back out but I wanted to get any opinion on those finances I could because we originally budgeted for 1200ish per month.. (without much reason other than being cheap to be honest.) But houses that would give us that monthly(around 170-180K) simply do not seem to exist any more and the market is empty below 200k which is what we are looking at right now. We previously did inspections on homes in 170k -180k area none previously passed inspection major issues. 200k Homes in our area all seem to have new roofs and AC no structural issues etc.

I will note I am very handy so home repairs aren't the biggest fear as I used to work doing repairs in restaurants and my dad helps me and was a roofer, carpenter and fabricator(but cannot help me financially they are very in debt). Biggest fears for home repair is plumbing ac etc. Landlord handles those now never handled them myself.

So essentially I will be going into home ownership with 26k in the bank and a monthly of around 1400 dollars. I have never paid this much to live anywhere. I have been living in the same cramped apartment in a bad part of town for 850 a month for 8 years since I first moved out of my parents(parents have owned the same house for 30 years paying 900 a month).

It is a difference or 550 a month. I just wanna make sure I am making the right decision and not getting in over my head.

Don't have many friends or family and parents are not good with finances hence why they cannot help me with anything/give good advice.

CryptoCurrency,NFT hype is here to rob people of their money. And to kill shitcoins,"Hi everyone








With the recent megahype in NFT market and every moving thing jumping bandwagon (only Santa and Jesus didn't released their own NFTs) we gonna have few inevitable things happening:












1. People gonna get scammed like you never seen before. For some reason making a fake ape is easier than making a fake crypto project so all smart and hard working scammers gonna move to NFT market.
I heard of ""crypto veterans"" with years of experience getting scammed. Imagine what's gonna happen to your average joe.














2. With all scammers and idiot's money going to NFT market, shitcoins gonna drop in popularity (yay!!) And we might have some well deserved shitcoin massacre. 















3. Celebrities gonna get even more fat by selling all their junk and lose that one last drop of respect people had for them.














4. NFT related projects in their current form will most likely boom for sometimes before people understand what a useless turd current NFTs are. Then there will be a drop and after that some project might finally get it right as NFTs do have a future. Just not like this.












5. Feds will use it as a new excuse to screw with cryptomarket.












My advice? Invest in NFT exchanges for short term profit. Sell high and after shit hits the fan buy again at low price. Only this time invest in actually useful NFT projects.
And don't try to buy ""long lost"" number 20004653 bored ape. It is most likely made buy a 15 years old from south east asia.

financialindependence,Important Update to 72t Allows at Least 50% More Flexibility in Withdrawals,"All credit goes to /u/ThaiTum. They [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/sl3jm8/daily_fi_discussion_thread_saturday_february_05/hvs1tjl/) that they couldn't create a top-level post for this, but in my opinion nothing could be more central to this subreddit than a major rules change for one of the two ways highlighted in the FAQ for early access to Traditional retirement accounts. 

#Background

For a quick refresher, 72t is shorthand for the option to take Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPPs) from your retirement accounts before age 59.5. You can take SEPPs from just one account, meaning you can do a ""right-sized"" rollover of funds into a separate Trad IRA and just take SEPPs from that account if needed. Once started, payments must proceed for 5 years or until age 59.5, whichever comes later. Payments start immediately and avoid any early withdrawal penalty, meaning there is no 5-year wait as there is with the Roth Conversion Ladder. However, failure to take the SEPPs as directed can lead to substantial penalties on all amounts previously taken. There are three calculation methods available, but for all intents and purposes the fixed amortization method typically provides the highest amount. See [this page](https://spintwig.com/fire-taxes/#72t_SEPP) for more detail on 72t SEPPs. 

#What was wrong with 72t before?

The calculation for SEPPs used a ""reasonable"" interest rate to help calculate the amount you could withdraw. This was previously defined as, at most, 120% of the [Federal Mid-Term Rate](https://www.irs.gov/applicable-federal-rates) published in either of the previous two months before the SEPPs were set up. For illustration, a 40-year old with a $1M portfolio using the most favorable inputs* would enter a rate of 1.69%, as this is 120% of the Mid-Term Rate published Feb 2022. This would give them a fixed amortization withdrawal amount of **$32,599**.

\* Fixed amortization method, single life expectancy table. [See calculator here.](https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/calculators/72-t-distribution-calculator/) 

#What's changed?

IRS Notice [2022-6](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-22-06.pdf) (PDF) has changed the definition of ""reasonable"" interest rate to be a maximum of either 5% or 120% of the Mid-Term Rate. Taking the same inputs above, the 40-year old retiree with a $1M portfolio can now withdraw up to **$56,764** from their portfolio before age 59.5. **This is increases their flexibility of dialing in their withdrawals by 74%.** 

#Conclusion

For those planning on using 72t, the new rules allow substantially more leeway in figuring out exactly how much they want to withdraw. Specifically, the ceiling withdrawal number has increased significantly, allowing someone to dial in pretty much any constant-dollar withdrawal amount up to at least 5.5% of the initial portfolio amount and get that amount immediately.

Important caveats still apply. SEPPs are very rigid, and you *must* withdraw the amount prescribed by your method for at least 5 years or until age 59.5, whichever comes later. This amount is not adjusted for inflation, so SEPPs may still be inappropriate for young retirees (say, &lt;50) if they're the only source of income. However, other supplementary sources (e.g. taxable, Roth contribution basis) may be useful as inflation adjustments and only need to be a fraction of the overall portfolio size to serve this purpose.",finance,1644147714.0

This is very nice flexibility to set your plan to use any rate from the 120% mid-term rate (has been very low lately) up to 5%.

datascience,Successful Data Science Organization Structures,"TL;DR: work in siloed old school org trying to modernize structure and process, help



I work at a large company in an applied data science role. My team supports multiple sub organizations as part of a larger, global function. Our company as a whole is extremely siloed - business functions have different process, software and practices pretty much everywhere. Work is particularly siloed in non engineering focused orgs (eg sales hr finance etc). The company will never move to a single org owns all model.

Our team has been trying to establish a common framework for scaling and doing data science (and generally analytics) for our organization with a goal of establishing common practices, feature stores, environments, and even a common platform. The goal is to give data scientists and analysts a “home” as they onboard and support this via a mostly federated structure. Another major goal is to share knowledge and code to upskill and build community inside of the organization.

We’ve run into headwinds from old school practices of IT teams full of offshore temp resource and a few PMs trying to “break into ML” and charge our partners in the organization capex while doing it. They don’t like to partner and would rather prefer to work in the early 2000s IT type silo (see siloes in this case). Other IT teams host common enterprise platforms. We also have managers in place who have trouble understanding that technical and highly quantitative employees can actually be part of business teams solving problems and gaining domain knowledge.

There is a definite culture shift / change management exercise needed and maybe I’m wrong in thinking establishing scalable working practices, data sharing and building a common knowledge graph are ideals to aspire to.

I’d love to know if someone has built or worked in what they think is a good organizational model for data science in support type functions… it would also be great to hear the horror stories too.",technology,1644154426.0

personalfinance,"Thoughts on ""never financing a toy""","Many people I have spoken to who consider themselves fairly financially responsible hold the opinion that it is perfectly responsible to finance necessities, like a home or a car (yes, a necessity everywhere I have lived),  but that it is irresponsible to finance toys like motorcycles, campers, and boats.

This seems like sound advice at first, and at one point I paid cash for an ATV while making payments on two cars and a house, and thought I was doing pretty good.

However, when you think about it, if you are paying on anything else, you are financing your toy, with a loan for something else that you could have paid down more instead of buying your toy.

I'm not saying you should put off buying anything fun until your house is paid off. That would be a waste of most of a lifetime for a lot of people.

I find myself casting wayward glances at motorcycles now, with my vehicles all paid off, a home mortgage that would take me a minimum of 10 years to pay off if I really hammered it, and a decent emergency fund and some investments.

The most responsible choice would obviously be to not buy a motorcycle. However, while I could pay cash for a motorcycle, it would be at the expense of my emergency fund or my investments. Pulling out of my index funds is almost sure to cost me more than the ridiculously low interest rates right now. 

I would argue that the most financially responsible way to get a toy at this point in my live would be to finance it.",finance,1644159174.0

I'd benefit from some feedback on how to make the most of a $20K gift. 31 year old making $73K a year. Long story short, grew up in a very wealthy family and parents squandered most everything in a long and bitter divorce when I turned 20. I have been completely financially independent since 20 and didn't have any guidance or instruction from my folks. As a result, I made some poor decisions when I first became independent and I have been paying for them since. A lot has changed over the last five years - I have developed a completely leaned out budget, I adhere to it religiously, and I have prioritized paying off debt above everything else. I have already paid off one credit card in full, as well as a personal loan that I had to take out to pay for car repairs when I was in college. My ultimate goal is to eliminate debt and begin to shift that money toward saving, investing, and buying a house down the road. 

I am very, very fortunate, and am going to receive a $20K gift from a family member - no strings attached. My thoughts are 1) Put much as possible into wiping out either my credit card or auto loan, use the money saved there to snowball and tackle the rest of my debt. 2) I'd like to put $4K in savings, as this is the one thing I've neglected in prioritizing debt. 

I'm all ears for any creative solutions on how to best utilize this. Do I pay off the auto loan or credit card first? I'm torn on this, as one has much higher interest, and the other has a very high monthly payment. Is there anything else I can do to make this go farther? Financial details below.

# Introduction

When designing any economy, be it P2E or non-blockchain based, it is important to first consider the types of economic agents in the space. These economic agents can be split into 5 personas - players, builders, developers, investors and NFT collectors.

We see these agents in traditional, non-blockchain based games too, although NFT collectors are the first of its kind. There are investors in non-blockchain games which are also a new dimension as the investor model has shifted. Because we see a new addition to the economic agents involved, the economics of P2E can change drastically, depending on the incentives to them.

For all economic agents, we look at them from the perspective of the existing economics design framework: Market Design, Mechanism Design and Token Design. The market design is the economy’s parameters, typically defined by the game developer, and by extension, game designer (aesthetic and economy design). Mechanism design

is the rules for economic participation in the game’s world. These determine both the gameplay and rules of how these agents interact with each other. Token design is the value creation when users interact in the game world.

The reason for having these personas is that they help to scope out the right economic policies in each unique game economy. As the underlying game is different, the economic policies can also differ greatly.

 

## 1) Players

Players are the core value creator in the game universe. The way the market can be created will affect the players entering. For instance, a Free to Play vs Pay to Play model. That can greatly affect the number of players, thus the thickness of the market.

The development for the game is also important as players do not just take on a single role. They can also take on the role of builders, and the open vs closed-source development can impact how market thickness is bootstrapped.

Depending on the level of ideal decentralisation, the players can also take on leadership and governance roles. Having such a plan in the roadmap can help in the ideation of the native governance token’s monetary policy.

If decentralisation is the goal, the interactions between agent types will be something to think about when designing the economic policies and token economics. After all, the token model emphasises the policies for these agents.

Understanding the player types help to have a better sense of the player behaviours. For instance, certain promotions might encourage adverse selection of bots and players, as opposed to real players, focusing on game play and value creation. That can definitely affect the effectiveness of increasing market size of the game.

In the context of mechanism design, traditional gameplay is of essence to players. The various incentive loops, pay to win and game scope enhance how fun the game is played, which helps in value creation by the players.

Lastly, in a Play to Earn model that we see in blockchain, tokens play a new and important role in the economy. Considerations like potential earnings in dollars, inflation rates, tradeoffs for late entrants and revenue share are important considerations of the player in any game.

## 2) Builders

Builders are a specific type of player in the game. Whilst they are not core infrastructure developers, they help to build the world, which then facilitates the game world for players. It is possible for one to be both a player and builder.

When building the game universe, assets and infrastructure, the builder considers the market at large. Such as the demographic reach, the in-game vs off-game activity, white-label vs license model and connectivity to off-game blocks and use-cases. This

increases the utility of infrastructure built, which increases the value creation multiplier to the builder.

For the mechanism design, this means the ability to leverage development of the main game to build new infrastructure. And to do that, it is important to be mindful of the rules of interaction.

# Introduction

When designing any economy, be it P2E or non-blockchain based, it is important to first consider the types of economic agents in the space. These economic agents can be split into 5 personas - players, builders, developers, investors and NFT collectors.

We see these agents in traditional, non-blockchain based games too, although NFT collectors are the first of its kind. There are investors in non-blockchain games which are also a new dimension as the investor model has shifted. Because we see a new addition to the economic agents involved, the economics of P2E can change drastically, depending on the incentives to them.

For all economic agents, we look at them from the perspective of the existing economics design framework: Market Design, Mechanism Design and Token Design. The market design is the economy’s parameters, typically defined by the game developer, and by extension, game designer (aesthetic and economy design). Mechanism design

is the rules for economic participation in the game’s world. These determine both the gameplay and rules of how these agents interact with each other. Token design is the value creation when users interact in the game world.

The reason for having these personas is that they help to scope out the right economic policies in each unique game economy. As the underlying game is different, the economic policies can also differ greatly.

 

## 1) Players

Players are the core value creator in the game universe. The way the market can be created will affect the players entering. For instance, a Free to Play vs Pay to Play model. That can greatly affect the number of players, thus the thickness of the market.

The development for the game is also important as players do not just take on a single role. They can also take on the role of builders, and the open vs closed-source development can impact how market thickness is bootstrapped.

Depending on the level of ideal decentralisation, the players can also take on leadership and governance roles. Having such a plan in the roadmap can help in the ideation of the native governance token’s monetary policy.

If decentralisation is the goal, the interactions between agent types will be something to think about when designing the economic policies and token economics. After all, the token model emphasises the policies for these agents.

Understanding the player types help to have a better sense of the player behaviours. For instance, certain promotions might encourage adverse selection of bots and players, as opposed to real players, focusing on game play and value creation. That can definitely affect the effectiveness of increasing market size of the game.

In the context of mechanism design, traditional gameplay is of essence to players. The various incentive loops, pay to win and game scope enhance how fun the game is played, which helps in value creation by the players.

Lastly, in a Play to Earn model that we see in blockchain, tokens play a new and important role in the economy. Considerations like potential earnings in dollars, inflation rates, tradeoffs for late entrants and revenue share are important considerations of the player in any game.

## 2) Builders

Builders are a specific type of player in the game. Whilst they are not core infrastructure developers, they help to build the world, which then facilitates the game world for players. It is possible for one to be both a player and builder.

When building the game universe, assets and infrastructure, the builder considers the market at large. Such as the demographic reach, the in-game vs off-game activity, white-label vs license model and connectivity to off-game blocks and use-cases. This

increases the utility of infrastructure built, which increases the value creation multiplier to the builder.

For the mechanism design, this means the ability to leverage development of the main game to build new infrastructure. And to do that, it is important to be mindful of the rules of interaction.

In token design, there needs to be value recognition for external parties. This value is realised by holding the tokens, hence it becomes a consideration when designing the monetary policy of the token.

## 3) Developers

As the core game developer, the market is not just players, but also potential partners and different types of players in the game. This increases thickness and also increases the type of users. A diversification of user-types helps to build a more antifragile, potentially countercyclical, system.

CryptoCurrency,Voting with Smart contracts,Let's say the Untied States adopts the use of Smart Contracts for local and Federal elections. How do you think that scenario would play out? I'll admit that my knowledge surrounding Smart Contracts is limited. I do have somewhat of an understanding of how they would operate but I'd be curious to see how it would be handled on such a large scale. So I'd assume each ballot casted would be one individual contract between the voter and I guess the network controlling the election? Do you think it would all but eliminate the possibility of cheating if done correctly? You'd have to put a lot of trust in the network in charge. We give private companies such as Dominion practically full control over how we vote electronically now so I wouldn't forsee that being an issue. I'd assume polling locations would still be open and individuals would still be able to vote early. Would you trust Citizens voting through personal devices? Open for discussion ofcourse.

personalfinance,Buying a house at the upper limit of our budget on two incomes. Are we stretching the budget too much?,"Here’s the facts:
We’re a married couple, expecting a baby. Both have paid leave for maternity/paternity. We’ve been trying to buy a house for 2 years— constantly outbid, and losing by only $2-5k each time. So we’ve decided to up our budget with a baby coming in a few short months. 

Our combined income: $210k/yr before taxes/benefits, net is $134k

We plan to put down: $145k on the house with a 30 year mortgage and 4% interest rate, $13k in taxes— which brings us to roughly $3,000 a month

Currently: we have $160k in stocks, $100k in cash savings, we own out current house “out right” valued at $220-250k depending on the bidding war. 

This house would put us in a much nicer neighborhood; excellent school district, low crime, and just looks cleaner. However, we are scared that this could be a horrible financial move. The house is a foreclosure, as-is sale (needs repairs). One of us is a carpenter, and we have connections to plumbers and siding folks. So we’re not too scared of fixing the “problems” but we’re worried that we won’t be able to afford daycare, vacations and saving $25-30k a year.

We estimate that our mortgage will be $3k. Right now we’re at $4k in regular expenses (car loans, grocery’s, student loans, eating out, etc). So if we’re bringing home roughly $11k a month. And spending $7k for the house+lifestyles… we’re left with just $4k for daycare and investments. We’ll probably have $200k in our investments after we put roughly $30-50k into fixing up the house. Day care is about $2.5k a month in our area for an infant. Leaving us with only 1.5k left (or $18k a year).

Ideally, we would never buy a house this expensive but we have been in 4 bidding wars and lost every time. We’ve watched houses go from $300k to $450k in our area. And, we’re at our wits end. We can’t believe that the market is still this BAD, and don’t know if it’s better to just save $450-$500k in equity, sell our house, and do an “all cash” offer. Or take the plunge now? And risk not being able to save as much as we want? Ideally, we would save $30k a year.

Btw we’re 35 and 31. This decision will impact how early we will be able to retire, we may have to wait until we are 60. But it’ll massively improve our happiness in the short term. Are we stretching our budget too much? And ruining our future?

personalfinance,"Market value of home goes down sharply after building home, results in underwater mortgage what should be done?","My fellow personalfiance gurus I want to present some food for thought and discussion. 

In this story Tom and Sally are in the market to buy a home in 2022. They have tried to make offers on homes however keep getting beat out by cash offers or buyers offering more money above the asking price with the buyer waiving appraisals. After putting in 50-60 offers in a suburb outside a major city lets say in Texas they have decided to go the route of building a home. They are aware interest rates are rising and because they are building they don’t have much of a choice. All inventory homes builders are offering are either sold quickly or results in a bidding war. The $/sqft to build has a premium however base home prices keep increasing with every lot being sold. 

Running the numbers the $/sqft in the area they were looking before covid was in the range of $110-$140/sqft to now $140-$170/sqft. 

Are these prices fueling a housing bubble with interest going to go up in the future? 

If Tom and Sally close on a home in 2022 for $300k, put down 20%, and therefore have a loan for $240k. They do a 30 year loan and in 2023 or 2024 there is a housing bubble pop. New build buyers have decreased severely and existing home sales no longer waive appraisals and offers are at or below asking.  

Comps are run on Tom and Sally’s home of similar sqft and they find out their homes is selling for $200k only! They are paying more for their mortgage than it is worth. If Tom and Sally stay in the home for several years the price may eventually recover however if life happens and they have to sell their home at $200k they made a bad investment and an underwater mortgage. What are their options in this scenario and does anyone else fear this happening?

From finance, the internet, to sports betting there has been significant transformation brought about by the adoption of the decentralized system of blockchain. The future is indeed DeFi.

To those unfamiliar with the term, it essentially means access to microloans by small entrepreneurs and SMEs on a blockchain ecosystem. In traditional microlending, the workflow is as thus, a microlending website collects funds from investors and funnels them to a borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. Essentially, access to loans is location sensitive. However, with DeFi microlending, borrowers from anywhere can access microlenders from anywhere. Once more, blockchain is highlighted in its transformational glory.

CryptoCurrency,Strudel DAO: Orkan Economic Policy Proposal,"### Section I: Conceptual Framework

From: https://gov.strudel.finance/t/orkan-economic-policy-proposal/92/1https://gov.strudel.finance/t/orkan-economic-policy-proposal/92/1


### 1.  Introduction:

The Strudel Protocol is the first trustless Bitcoin bridge for Ethereum. We design incentives to create a market for vBTC across the interchain. started as a simple yield farming protocol which has evolved over time to include several products over multiple chains. This expansion seeks to diversify the Strudel Bitcoin market in order to create opportunities for users to deploy their vBTC.

The purpose of the following document is to achieve consistency in the actions taken by the DAO in future endeavors. Monetary policy should be a goal driven endeavor which will require different solutions for specific market conditions. By implementing a mandate driven strategy, the DAO can understand the motivations behind specific actions under a broader purpose which may involve making short term decisions that are not optimal from a purely profit optimization standpoint. 


### 2. Bitcoin as a Primitive 

#### What is a Crypto-Economic Primitive?

 Crypto Primitives are protocol-based incentives systems that are uniquely enabled by tokens. Also referred to as “tokenized economic games”. They enable the coordination and allocation of capital to achieve a shared goal via the use of various economic and cryptographic mechanisms. 

Bitcoin can be considered as the original crypto-financial primitive which allows other assets to have value. Bitcoin enables protocols to create markets over which other primitives can be composed. However, although BTC is one of the main sources of liquidity for Ethereum and virtually all other tokens off chain it has had little uptake as the default currency of the interchain. Ethereum has filled that role to a degree finding itself as the go to asset to transfer wealth across chains.

The appeal of BTC as a store of value is going to become more and more apparent over time. With the growth of the Interchain economy the neutrality that BTC offers creates a common currency that all other chains can adopt and issue their assets against. It is also the most readily adopted network by legacy systems and large-scale networks that will need to be onboarded into the Web3 economy to enable the realignment of incentives we are trying to create collectively

For the BTC network it is important to find sustainable ways to participate in the Web3 economy. By promoting integrations with a broadly understood asset the Strudel Protocol aims to be the biggest BTC advocate for the Interchain. Our liquidity landscape is constantly expanding. As new primitives enter DeFi, Strudel DAO implements them utilizing vBTC as the liquidity pairing for a number of different assets further increasing our network of products and the diversity of the economic activity going through the network. 
 
As the protocol grows markets in more networks our own network effect increases adding value to everyone involved with the Strudel DAO across the interchain. Arbitrageurs distribute value by utilizing vBTC to settle across many different asset classes and networks. By selecting the correct incentive models and monetary policy Strudel DAO can create several liquid markets which expose vBTC and $TRDL holders to several emerging market opportunities such as fractionalized NFTs and interesting L1 opportunities in networks such as FTM and Matic.
 


### 4.- Defi 2.0 Economics

A brand-new class of algo stablecoin projects have emerged recent market, which are called DeFi 2.0.  They have enjoyed large expansion not only in market cap but also in business scale in no more than 30 days, and largely driven by community rather than institutions, among them are Olympus, Spell, Alchemix and others. The two major features of DeFi 2.0 is protocol owned liquidity and yield enhancement from product perspective.

### OHM(Olympus DAO)

Olympus DAO, the protocol behind OHM, is a collateralized asset issuing system, where outstanding OHM backed by treasury reserves obtained by the issuance of short-term Bonds. Bond sales are the core part in Olympus, as its sales proceeds go to the treasury and are used as the backing to mint OHM, which in turns feeds the rebase reward to the stakers. Bonding is considered as an active, short-term strategy for price discovery. 

Reserves obtained from bond sales are managed to increase the perceived value of the protocol and induce growth through increase demand for the ecosystem assets. However, OHM is not pegged to any asset and allowed to fluctuate, because its aim not becoming a stablecoin but rather an algorithmic reserve currency. Though OHM is backed, not pegged, the combined value treasury assets act as a floor price under which users can enter an arbitrage trade as the treasury is capable of buying back outstanding supply.

### Treasury as a Primitive

The main appeal of a bond issuing platform is the creation of a sizeable treasury. Treasuries can be considered primitives because the collection of capital in a centralized point enable new financial instruments to be implemented. In a paradoxical way the creation of bonds is possible because bonds create a treasury which then in turn drives further bond issuance as the ownership of that treasury is desirable to newer market participants. Once this is established a series of products can be created on top such as credit offerings and interest programs for deposits. 

### Bond Issuance Impact on the vBTC peg

As Robert Sams [describes](https://blog.bitmex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/A-Note-on-Cryptocurrency-Stabilisation-Seigniorage-Shares.pdf), ""Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin govern the supply of coin through simple and deterministic coin growth rules. As a result, unanticipated changes in coin demand are reflected in changes in coin price, causing volatility and discouraging usage of coin as media-of-exchange."" Strudel DAO has iterated on the [seigniorage share system](https://strudelfinance.medium.com/?p=c2b64b913642) in the past. Our current next generation design introduces Perpetual Bond Auctions and Treasury Management as a primitive in order to align the protocol incentives with its mandate. This allows us to incorporate an elastic supply rule that adjust the quantity of vBTC supply proportionately to changes in market dynamics.


&lt;center&gt; 
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/jPJM6J3.png)
&lt;/center&gt;

Perpetual Bond Auctions

A perpetual bond auctions enable the control of the vBTC supply in the following two scenarios:

- If the price of vBTC is under the peg the free-floating supply of vBTC needs to decrease, then $ORK bonds are incentivized by lowering the BCV, which increases the demand for vBTC to purchase bonds at a discount. Alternatively other treasury assets can be used to increase the treasury vBTC stock


- If vBTC price is above the peg the free-floating supply of vBTC should increase through increased bridge usage, Alternatively vBTC stock can be swapped for other types of tokenized BTC in order to diversify the treasury balance sheet. The BCV can be increased if necessary.

### Mandate Based treasuries.

Considering treasuries can gather significant holdings the possibilities of how those assets can be deployed is essentially infinite. Furthermore, there is a need for a overarching purpose to be established in order for a treasury to grow past the initial exponential phase. A Mandate based management provides a frame of reference for the scope in which the DAO should act.  While mandates are not absolute, can and should be updated, they should drive the reasoning behind every action the treasury takes. Mandates therefore aim to provide a shared truth under which the DAO can operate update allowing for a scientific governance approach based on policy and facts.



The permanent nature of DAOs allow a longer time frame to be established where a DAO mandate can be enforced indefinitely to grow the protocol holdings forever. There will be periods of contraction and growth rate will taper significantly after an initial exponential phase but over a long enough timeframe if the DAO continues to exist the treasury is much more likely to grow in perpetuity.


 ## 3.- The Strudel DAO Economic Mandates

### The Strudel DAO Mandates
***The Strudel DAO's first mandate is to secure the peg of vBTC.***
This is a broad mandate that is achieved by implementing several distinct strategies which include but are not limited to:
- Funding the development of the Strudel Ecosystem
- Acquiring vBTC, Liquidity pool positions and yield incentivization tokens
- Acquiring other BTC wrapped assets to create a indexed BTC position


***The Strudel DAO's second mandate is to design incentive structures that issue and manage reserve backed currencies***

These structures are governed by the strudel economic policy 
- Liquidity Incentives 
- Bond Emissions
- Fixed Term Deposits
- Dutch Auction Emissions
- Index Funds

### Section II The Orkan

1. Project Description

Orkan is designed as a standalone expansion to the Strudel Network. The perpetual bond issuance allows the rapid acquisition of a number of strategic assets that open several opportunities in the FTM ecosystem. By having two independent structures bidding as protocols for vBTC demand is going to be insured and arbitrage between chains while provide a profitable market for an increased number of users who will deepen our liquidity landscape. 

Furthermore, the Orkan is looking to acquire voting power for exchange incentives which will allow it to capture new yield opportunities for vBTC pools within the FTM ecosystem. By having a leading role in the growth of novel networks Strudel DAO can become an institution for liquidity provision on BTC denominated markets across the interchain.

2. Project Objectives

Protocol growth metrics provide objective milestones around which economic policy can be determined.Success will be measured using protocol growth rates, revenue produced from treasury assets and interest accrued from deposits.

Protocol health will be periodically assesed by the DAO economic policy team to modify variables in order to grow along expectations. The initial targets for the protocol are the following:

Protocol Controled Vaue = 2'000,000 USD
Monthy Revenue = 100,000 USD
Average daily combined bond volume = 25,000 USD
Mcap/PCV ratio= &gt; 60%

The initial targets are expected to be met within the first 4 weeks of the project's activity. Once initial targets are met consensus should be reestablished as to what policy should be implemented in order to meet sustainable growth rates. 


    

## 3. Orkan Initial Network State
### A.	Initial Bond Offering and Bond Control Variable (BCV) and Size
    
    
| Asset | Discount (BCV) | Target Holding Size  | Target Holding % |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
| FTM/ORK       | 20%     | 1'000,000$     |50%
| vBTC       | 0%     |  100,000$    |5%
| wBTC       | 10%     |   400,000$   |20%
| Spirit       | 20%     |     500,000$ |25%

### B. Asset Description

#### 	FTM/ORK LP 
In order to support Bond issuance the protocol must own a controlling share of the available liquidity. Therefore, FTM/ORK offering will be available at a discount in relation with other bonds. The target allocation for FTM/ORK LP holding in the treasury is 50% (see above table). At an initial $2 million valuation target, the holding size will be $1 million total held in the treasury.

#### Spirit

Spirit can be locked in order to vote on allocations for incentives for specific pools. By securing a revenue stream for protocol owned liquidity the treasury will be able to incentivize its assets and attract farmers to participate in our incentivized pools

By securing incentives for Bitcoin denominated assets Orkan can foster the growth of BTC liquidity in the FTM network attracting new TVL to the chain.

#### Bitcoin

Orkan is designed to grow a treasury of Bitcoin indefinetly. By becoming the first DAO to explicitly accumulate BTC we can over time control a significant position in the network. The Bitcoin design allows for value to be stored in perpetuity which makes it the perfect asset for a treasury to hold as backing. 

The treasury will initially be mainly composed of wBTC which is the most widely used BTC wrapper on chain. Over time other wrappers will be introduced in order to diversify the risk profile of on chain BTC. As per the table above, the treasury will offer bonds for wBTC in addition to vBTC at a target holding of 20% or $400,000 for wBTC.  

We are starting with a small target holding in this token because the reduced number of vBTC in existence. Removing a significant ammount of vBTC from the supply should help complete the Strudel DAO mandate by arbing the peg. At 5% the treasury will hold $100,000 worth of vBTC.

 
### f.	Initial Rebase Rate
0.5% per rebase will be the initial rate on launch until the treasury reaches a total of $2,000,000 in the treasury (or its close equivalent). After that it will be tapered for the sustainability of protocol growth rate.
 
### g.	Contributor Reward Structure
Contributors will be rewarded via CoordinApe. Payment will be managed and executed from the Treasury Manager in the form of vested ORKAN tokens obtained from the sales of bonds. The payouts should not exceed 10% of the monthly bond revenue.
 
### h.	Multisig Participation Structure and Development Plan
Multisig participants will number between 5 and 8 operators, with a majority vote required. Additional multisig participants should be added by proposal on the governance forum (https://gov.strudel.finance)

personalfinance,Paying down spouses student loans with low interest,"My spouse has 77k left on her student loans. I think we've done a pretty good job chipping away overtime (they started at 160K). She refinanced a few times (I've read this is not always advisable, but from what I've read we weren't expecting some of the fed loan benefits such as low forgiveness). Currently the minimum payment is 1608, but we pay 2100 a month in biweekly payments to get the extra payment per year. Interest rate is 3.39%

Currently most of her pay goes towards her loans. On my end I'm maxing out my 401k, HSA, and contributing to Roth. On her end she gets the full match for her 401k. We have a 6 month emergency fund as well. Online calculators show our extra payments may drop the remainder of the payoff time from 4 to \~3 years. 

As we've been looking over our budget I'm wondering if we should instead pay the minimum payment to free up some more money for our monthly budget and potentially some more savings/investing? With the lower interest is, would paying the minimum and saving and investing be advantageous? Or should we keep making the extra payment and even look to do some additional payments (from bonuses) to accelerate? Any other strategies we might consider? (keep refinancing but continue to pay our current payment to lower interest).",finance,1644204460.0

1. NFTs


Say whatever you want, these fucking JPEGs have no value whatsoever. Yes, there are great uses for NFTs, but speculating on them isn’t one.

I have even read somewhere about NFTs being accepted as collateral somewhere to take loans. This is just bad.

2. Farming dexes

Its full of them, on every ecossystem. Basically you receive “incentives” to provide LP between a bunch of useless coins and then you can receive the reward of the useless LP dex coin.

Its like literally creating money out of thin air. If more than a few people decided to sell, the price just tanks really hard.

3. Tether

I don’t think I need to explain anything.

4. Metaverse

Any of you guys that actually own metaverse coins….. tried the metaverse ? I did. It sucks. Its worse than a Minecraft single player. People are just speculating over it.

stocks,Was Jan 24th a canary in the coal mine?,"On January 24th, 2022, the S&amp;P 500 was falling hard and more and more puts were bought on the way down, exacerbating the already heavy negative gamma situation from the LEAP options expiry on the 21st.  Many people have since claimed that the supposed Plunge Protection Team (PPT) stepped in and sold $50B in puts to force market makers (MMs) to hedge by buying up shares, halting the drop and squashing the VIX (which was damn high apparently).

Tapering of Quantitative Easing (QE) by the FED caused the bond purchasing minimum to be 50% in Feb as compared to Jan.  The monthly options expiration for Feb is coming up and after the FAANG earnings vs. stock price debacle recently, stocks in FAANG are trading below their max pains.  Also, the put to call ratio on the SPY is only going up as one looks through options expirations over the next two weeks.

After the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Powell gave his speech outlining rate increases coming in 2022 and 2023.  Nothing happened with the market.  Three weeks later when the minutes for the SAME MEETING were released, the market dumped a bit.  Similarly, Jan 25-26th meeting, Powell gave his press conference and even an early text release of his speech and the market was fine.  The meeting minutes for that meeting will be probably released on Feb 16th (as they tend to lag 3 weeks before releasing them).  What will the market do?

The supplemental liquidity deposit period for monthly options expiration, under old rules, starts on Feb 16th.  The newer rules allow new requests to be made through to two trading days after expiration, so Feb 23rd (21st NYSE holiday).  BTW, this also applied to Jan 24th and 25th.

So, Jan 24th could have been a massive correction (technically the S&amp;P500 was down $400 from $4600 to $4200 or so during the SLD period around Jan 21st options expiration) but was supposedly stopped.   A crisis averted, but a canary no less?

What do you think about February monthly options expiration Feb 18th, where this all appears to be poised to repeat?  What about March? QE is supposed to baseline to $0 minimum purchased bonds and (commercial) mortgage backed securities, and the first (of four in 2022) expected rate hike of 0.25% is probably slated for March.

44. Seabug has dropped a new medium article on their protocol for self-governed NFTs. This may turn out to be somewhat controversial to some since it may be seen as diminishing the unimpinged bearer bond like status of a crypto token issued under the protocol in exchange for theft protection.

At the same time ""DeFiChain"" keeps its own consensus mechanism and function set, allowing for all those characteristics that Bitcoin does not inherently have.

\[UPDATE\] My W-4 Step 1-C is set to Single or Married Filing Separately. Should that be changed/what happens if I change it?

Good morning,

I'm considering adjusting my W-4 so that I get no tax refund or a very small one (&lt;400) or if anyone can explain to me why I shouldn't, that would also be really appreciated. My main concern is getting all of the money that I've earned.

For reference, I make 130K, married filing jointly (spouse does not work), 2 dependents (4 and 8), max out 401k, and Traditional IRA.

My current W-4 says Step 3, $4000

I get paid every 2 weeks and my most recent pay stub: Federal withholding 391.35 and YTD 1598.79

stocks,(2/7) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the first trading day of this week and a frrrrrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, February 7th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures rise slightly after S&amp;P 500 posts best week of the year](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures turned slightly positive in early morning trading on Monday after the S&amp;P posted its best week of 2022, boosted by quarterly earnings reports and a better-than-expected January employment report.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 57 points, or about 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures ticked up roughly 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching more earnings reports this week, though the blistering pace of the past few weeks will slow.
*****
&gt; Big inflation news also is on the horizon, with the Labor Department on Thursday set to release consumer price index data for January. The report is expected to show that inflation rose at a 7.2% pace from a year ago, which if accurate would be the fastest gain since February 1982.
*****
&gt; Markets have been bracing against the fallout from inflation and are now pricing in about a 35% chance that the Federal Reserve will hike its benchmark short-term borrowing rate by half a percentage point, or 50 basis points, in March.
*****
&gt; Government bond yields were little changed Monday after racing higher following Friday’s unexpectedly strong nonfarm payrolls report for January. The benchmark 10-year note most recently yielded 1.92%.
*****
&gt; Peloton shares surged in premarket trading Monday on reports that Amazon and Nike are lining up as possible suitors for the interactive fitness equipment maker. The stock surged 25% on the news, which comes just a few days after activist investor Blackwells Capital urged the company to consider a sale and to fire its CEO.
*****
&gt; Spotify saw its shares decline 1.3% after the company said it condemns past use of racial slurs by controversial podcast host Joe Rogan but would not remove him from the streaming site. Artists including Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and India.Arie have asked Spotify to remove their music in protest over Rogan.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, shares of Spirit Airlines jumped 11% after Frontier Airlines announced a deal to merge with its low-cost competitor. The news appeared to boost sentiment among airlines generally, with shares of United and Delta Air Lines rising nearly 2% premarket.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite advanced on Friday for their fifth positive session in the last six, and the indices also posted their best week since December. The Dow slid 0.06% on Friday, but still managed to post a 1.05% gain for the week. The Russell 2,000 meantime posted its first positive week in five and best week of 2022.
*****
&gt; “Investor psychology is shifting almost week-to-week, meaning sticking to one’s investment convictions is about as hard (or painful) as ever, but also never more important in driving outperformance,” Raymond James strategist Tavis McCourt said in a note to clients. “Our conviction remains that economic strength will keep EPS keeps going higher along with interest rates, as we suspect we remain a long way from higher rates materially slowing demand in the economy.”
*****
&gt; Earnings reports and the jobs report pushed the major averages higher. The Labor Department said Friday that 467,000 jobs were added in January, well ahead of the 150,000 economists polled by Dow Jones were expecting.
*****
&gt; Last week’s gains follow a rocky start to the year for the major averages as rising rates prompted investors to shed growth names in favor of value-oriented areas of the market.
*****
&gt; “It has been a raging bear market for high multiple stocks and for anything speculative in nature. It’s just been taken out to the woodshed. So there’s probably some value being created there now,” Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson said on “Squawk Box.” The strategist said he still recommends a tilt toward more defensive areas of the market and thinks the indexes may not have hit a bottom yet.
*****
&gt; So far 56% of S&amp;P 500 companies have posted quarterly earnings, with 79% beating earnings estimates and 77% topping revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Individual performance has been different, however. Amazon shares added 13.5% on Friday, while Snap surged 58.8%. Facebook-parent Meta dropped 26% on Thursday after its quarterly update. The social media company is coming off its worst week on record.
*****
&gt; Another busy week of earnings is on deck with 76 S&amp;P 500 companies set to post results. Three Dow components will provide quarterly updates, including Disney and Coca-Cola. Amgen, Take-Two Interact

personalfinance,When / whether to refinance federal student loans?,"When I graduated college in 2012 I couldn’t afford the numerous payments ($50 x 5 minimums, plus a larger minimum at the lender that held the largest loan), so I had them consolidated via a federal direct consolidation loan program. That means I am locked into the interest rate (6.5%) unless I consolidate them privately. I obviously won’t do anything with that now as long as interest is deferred, but are there any risks or benefits for going public to private besides lowering my interest rate? For reference, I have $20,871 in loans still and my projected payoff isn’t until 2035. My husband has over $80k in student loans but he’s a teacher so we are on IBR for his and hoping he will qualify for PSLF in 9 years (this is his first year teaching).

We have 3 children, and other than student loans a mortgage is our only debt. We lead a pretty damn modest lifestyle so there isn’t much we can trim to pay things down sooner. We are also both contributing to retirement (my 401k, his STRS) and that is pretty on track, but saving for the future is also part of why we can’t pay debt down more quickly. 

We recognize now what a mistake the student loan situation was, but when you’re 18 and your parents spend your whole life telling you that college is the only option, you don’t always know what you’re getting yourself into. We plan to counsel our own children much differently than we were, but for now we are just focused on the best way to move forward financially from a debt management perspective.",finance,1644248687.0

personalfinance,Consolidate student loans for PSLF payment eligibility?,"Currently, I owe a lot in student loans (roughly $100k total) - some were taken out many years ago, but most in the last 6 or 7 years. The older ones I make minimal monthly payments on, and have done so for several years now, whereas the newer ones I haven't paid on, and that's because the government hold on repayment came just a few months before I had to start paying on them. Right now I work in government, and have the majority of my loans (the ones I don't pay on) managed by FedLoan under PSLF eligibility, however, the ones I pay on monthly are managed by AES and therefore don't qualify under PSLF.

Recently though, AES has sent me a few communications informing me that I could consolidate the loans they hold to become eligible under PSLF, and the benefit there would be that those payments would qualify as PSLF payments because of a temporary offering from the government.

Now, I just cannot comprehend the explanations given on both the AES and FedLoan websites around consolidation, the pros/cons, or the details of my loans (I DID NOT excel in finance....), but I definitely want the monthly payments I've made to AES to count towards the 120 payments required for PSLF forgiveness.

All $5k was used, with nothing left over, and nothing from 2020 used to cover 2021 expenses. Her W-2 lists the $5k as Dependent Care Benefits (DCB) in box 10, but the amount is also listed under box 14 under IRC 125.

Since DCFSA affects Federal and Social Security taxes there's no ambiguity on how to calculate the credit for Federal Income Tax purposes and all is it should be.

However, I'm confused how the Child and Dependent Care Credit should be calculated for the NYS tax return, or if I'm eligible. IRC125 adds back the $5k to my NYS/NYC taxable income because *it is* subject to NYS and NYC taxes.

Since they are taxed income and no NYS Tax benefit is derived, is the $5k still counted as received DCB? If so, I'm ineligible. If not, I'm eligible for an additional $360 return from NYS.

The problem I've encountered is that on the NYS Return TurboTax asks if IRC125 is taxable, and counts 0 towards DCB and FreeTaxUSA doesn't ask, treats it as taxable by default, but counts the $5000 towards DCB. Only one of these can be correct.",finance,1644253766.0
personalfinance,Withdrawing 401K Early - Questions,"Hello,

I understand that early withdrawals from 401(k)s may trigger penalties and taxes, but exceptions exist.  I wanted to clarify on a couple things, if you don't mind helping me better understand I would greatly appreciate it!  

My scenario:  I lost my job and am in a bind financially, I am considering withdrawing from what was my 401K.  I also have some money in stocks that I am considering withdrawing.  I completed the paperwork/transfer for my previous 401K into my current IRA account with Vanguard.  The money is now in my Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement Fund).  It's approx. $30K.  I also have previous money in this IRA, not from the 401K transfer.  

I understand that if I withdraw this money, I will incur a 10% early withdrawal penalty right off the top.  After that, I will also owe taxes on this withdraw, but it will be based on my tax bracket for this year where ever I end up, is that true?   

Also, is it true that Vanguard will take an additional 20% on top of the early withdrawal penalty to cover the potential tax liability?  So basically it would be 30% off the top,  or is it only the 10% now and I would owe taxes later?    

My other question has to do with possibly qualifying for any exceptions to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.  I see that one of the factors is "" You rolled the account over to another retirement plan (within a certain time).""  Would that apply in my situation?  

Thank you very much for your time and response.  I did my research but wanted to be sure on these points before I decide my strategy going forward.",finance,1644254442.0

CryptoCurrency,We're not out of the hay yet...,"Benjamin Cowen has said on many occasion - the crypto market is still too young to break away from the traditional market, so here I am again to try shed some light on what's happening outside of the cryptobox (and I will be until the inevitable inversion when crypto is the one on the outside of the box).

This little bump is but a reaction to this bull trap. We're not out of the hay yet and here's why... without any financial advice!

It is now possible to see that the latest downward move on Wall Street is in fact a major correction – mainly because it has fallen between 10% and 20% - at least on an intraday basis. I expect, however, that the upward move on the four days from Friday 28th January to Tuesday 2nd February represent a “bull trap” - which means that the correction will fall further. In fact, we expect it to break down through the support level at 4300 and head to somewhere between 3800 and 4000 before it bottoms.

&amp;#x200B;

[ S&amp;P500 Index: March 2021 - February 2022. Chart by ShareFriend Pro ](https://preview.redd.it/5j8dl72ifgg81.png?width=1654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c3a196c517b3659f03dfbd48ab596361a0ec8f)

Obviously, this further fall will be accompanied by a disappearance of those bulls who have been intent on buying the dips. And some of them will certainly be afraid that what they are looking at is the beginning of a major bear trend.

But I do not think it is. My reasons for believing that the 13-year-old bull market is still intact are essentially fundamental. The American and world economies are not heading towards a recession – very much the contrary. From a purely objective point of view, interest rates are at record lows in most first world countries, including America – and those same countries have been furiously printing and injecting money into their economies since COVID-19 began at the beginning of 2020 (and before).

In my view, quantitative easing will have to end, and rates will have to rise to at least 3% or 4% in America before they begin to have a material impact on the profits of listed companies. And I simply don’t see that happening this year – or next. So, my opinion is that, following the completion of this correction, the markets of the world including crypto will resume their upward momentum at least until the end of 2023 – and probably beyond.

This viewpoint is echoed in the continuing rise in the oil price:

&amp;#x200B;

[ North Sea Brent Oil: January 2020 - February 2022. Chart by ShareFriend Pro](https://preview.redd.it/rcwq9q2sfgg81.png?width=1629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=998c7b05f3bc5e76e3d7a32f6c50415c2e69760d)

As you can see here, North Sea Brent oil has recently made another post-COVID19 record high at $92 per barrel. It is rising steadily in a strong upward channel. If the world economy is headed into a recession, then why is oil rising like this?

The simple fact of the matter is that economists generally have and are completely under-estimating the long-term impact of Q/E. It’s almost as if they believe that the $20 trillion or so that has been injected into the world economy over the past 11 years is irrelevant – that its effects are already somehow discounted. My view is that the true impact of this massive monetary stimulation is only now beginning to be felt economically and that some kind of unprecedented asset blow-off is in the making.

The world is awash with cash. That is why commodities like oil are rising and why the crypto assets in general have been making continuously new record highs since the beginning of 2020. Investors are seeking real assets to protect them from the impending debasement of paper currencies, and many have said bitcoin is such.

As a crypto fanatic your approach should be to prepare yourself to take advantage of the recovery from the current correction. And then formulate a strategy for assessing the longer-term systematic risk in the market. Undoubtedly, this great bull market will come to an end eventually. Where do you want to be financially when that happens? And how will you know that it is imminent?",cryptocurrency,1644258851.0

26% is $4077 on $15680 and $5329 on $20497, making the net prices $11,603 for cash and $15,168 for the loan.

CryptoCurrency,February is usually bullish. Why these price rises make complete logical sense,"This is **not** copium or hopium (temporary hopium I guess?). I do believe prices will drop again in March and again towards tax season. This post is mainly about the **logic** of why February is seeing price rises and why it makes sense.

Few reasons why prices are rising:

- February historically has usually been bullish in all markets globally

- Extremely large drops are almost always followed up by price rises despite any negative news

- Tax season hasn't started and countries haven't opened their electronic tax-filling services. Prices usually drop closer towards April when people withdraw funds to pay taxes (but then rebound 1-2 weeks afterwards)

- Still unknown [but recent news regarding the conflict between Russia and Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60281863) may soon dwindle as they prepare to make a deal. Again, not 100% confirmed and anything can still happen.

- Employment/Job growth stats were bullish

- Recent US crypto-related bill positive news

- The federal reserve meeting in March is still a ways away. Last meeting at the end of January crypto prices didn't fall too sharply and were already rebounding despite neutral news regarding interest rates. It's also unknown how big the rates will be, and there's always the possibility they won't be raised this time again, as unlikely as that is, however recent good news regarding the economy could prove that theory right



- COVID is starting to be accepted as endemic from multiple countries globally now

Once again, I do honestly believe we're going to drop again, but the real question is how high are we going to go in February/the beginning of March before that happens.

Some cryptocurrencies *did* go back to their ATH's after the last large drop last year and stayed there for quite a while, and it appears that price action is being repeated right now, but that's pure speculation on my part.

The real test is how prices will go during the next FED meeting.",cryptocurrency,1644268963.0

CryptoCurrency,Staking Pancake and Olympus,"Hi everyone. Happy to be here and to read everyone’s posts. It’s been interesting to say the least. 

So to give a little background, I have been investing in crypto from time to time. I am supposed to get some money in March that I plan on investing. Thus I’ve been looking into some ideas for things to invest in. I am particularly interested in slowly building up passive income streams, which is why staking has been interesting to me.

Now, before I go on, I just wanted to let everyone know that I am not trying to go all in on any specific currencies. I know that such a move is a dumb idea, so if I were to go through with any of the investment ideas I’m talking about here, I will probably use a portion of what I will receive into Pancake or OHM or whatever. I am also not investing any money that I would normally use to pay bills or keep myself alive.

Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I wanted to ask everyone if they’d recommend staking Pancake and Olympus. I’ve done some research on pancake and I like what I see, and it looks like they’re doing regular burns to offset inflation. I know we are in a bear market right now, but I do think that there is promise for PancakeSwap. My only worry is the utility of the token, but who knows? I probably don’t know what I am even talking about. Hence I am asking on here about what everyone thinks about staking pancake

As for Olympus (OMH), the APY looks insane, which made me skeptical initially, but the liquidity looks good and people seem to have nothing but good things to say about it. I know the APY will probably go down over time like Pancake did, but for the time being (provided that this is legit), I think that this could be a great opportunity for me. But I want to hear what everyone else has to say.


If not, what are some other staking recommendations that y’all have? I have gotten worried about the inflation rate here in the US (7% a year) and it looks like the banks are not going to help with their pitiful interest rates (typically they don’t even reach 1% per year, which is a slap in the face to anyone not trying to lose their money). That’s why I’ve been seriously thinking about staking, as the returns look better than what your average bank offers me for sticking my money in an account and forgetting about it for however long. I understand it is always inherently risky, but I am young and I am more than willing to give it a go. I’ve also heard about Midas Investment and it looks pretty promising too. However, I would love to hear what everyone else has to say about all of this! 

I also want to apologize in advance if I sound like a total n00b, as I am trying to figure all of this out. Also sorry if this sounds like stream of consciousness writing as I just woke up lmfao",cryptocurrency,1644270053.0

personalfinance,How to target student loans,"Hello everyone.

I recently got into a debate with my family and it seems everyone disagrees with me but I still believe I’m right. I figured this sub would be a good place to get valuable feedback.

My student loans are actually 5 separate loans with varying rates and principal balances. The website offers a payoff plan that groups the loans together but it also lets you target specific loans.

My plan is to make the payment each month that fits my payoff plan. Then, any additional payments that I make, I plan to target the loan that is generating the most interest. 

My family believes that I should simply target the loans that have the highest interest rate.

From my perspective, the interest rate is just one variable. Currently, my lower rate loans have much higher principals and are costing me more in interest every month.

Edit: It seems the sub is divided as well as my family lol",finance,1644272814.0

Forex,Can EUR/USD rally to a new high this week?,"EUR/USD received a boost last week, gaining around 2.7%, as the ECB finally began to show concerns over Eurozone inflation. 

Following the monetary policy meeting, ECB sources claimed that the central bank might now be looking to recalibrate their policy, and that a 2022 rate hike is not off the table. This was an extremely hawkish pivot relative to how dovish the ECB has been recently, and could help support Euro bulls in the build-up to the next meeting. EUR/USD is hovering just below January’s highs near 1.1480, and a close above this level could help start a sustained leg higher.

However, the pair’s ability to rally this week will also depend on the US Dollar’s strength. The greenback traded lower on Monday as US yields eased slightly, but with expectations for Thursday’s inflation data to hit 40-year highs, it could add to the speculation of a 50bps rate hike from the Fed in March. Therefore, a hot print is likely to reignite the USD, which might result in EUR/USD topping out at the current levels yet again. 

All trading carries risk, but it should be worth adding this pair to the watchlist this week.",finance,1644285676.0

I originally went to school back in 2015, completed two semesters, and decided to drop out, as school was not serving my highest interest at the time. When I left, I started making payments on my student loans through the federal website.  


I decided that it was time for me to go back to school as an adult learner (more financial aid without my parents income), but discovered that one of my loans went into default. Although all of my loans where federal, one loan was a federal loan through the school and I should have been making a separate payment to the school directly.   


Now, in order for me to go back to school and receive aid, I must get this squared away. Unfortunately, the school had been trying to contact me for years at an address I haven't lived at since 2015; the school sent the debt to the attorney general.

They are requesting $13,300 to pay off what I owe (I initially took out $5,500). They are claiming $800 in interest, $2,700 in court/lawyer fees, and there is about $4,000 of unknown charges that I am waiting to get a break down of. 

I've submitted a settlement offer, but it was denied. After I receive the break down of the extra $4,000, I will put in another offer, but can only go as high as $9,500. I can pay that out of pocket, however that is the absolute last resort as it may hurt me during my upcoming degree pursuit.

I have played around in the market before and I don't really want to do that with this money. I absolutely cannot lose the principal value. I was thinking of investing in real estate. 100,000 is a very decent down payment, my parents would help me out with ""flipping the house"" than I would rent the house out for at least the time I am in college and grad school for. Eventually I would sell the house and buy my own. I do think this is a reasonable idea but not necessarily in today's real estate market.

My question is do you think real estate is a wise investment for me? What other investments are out there that fit my criteria? Overall I want to invest the money because It is currently decaying as it sits in the bank with such high interest rates. I feel like from 18-25ish the expectation is that you incur debt, borrow from your parents, live in an apartment... I do not want to do this, I want to start building wealth and becoming financially independent. All advice is welcome.

Edit: Just some additional information my parents have been very involved in construction, law and reality for years so that lessens the risk associated with real estate somewhat, and makes them more comfortable with the idea compared to the stock market. Also education expenses are not really an issue because I am going to go to whatever school gives me the best financial deal and whatever tuition I do have to pay I can pay from income. the catch to that is my goal is to go to medical school and that's a whole different ball game I was hoping to use money from rent collected to help pay for med school in four years.

I asked why the price was higher and they stated that it was due to the deal accessories, low jack, paint stone guard, and other things. I thought okay that's why the price was higher, after I came home I just kept thinking something was off. I can't do anything do to them being closed sunday's. I went to the dealer today and they basically told me I signed the contract and that's it or I could take it to another dealer and trade it in. I was pissed and started reaching out to corporate, GM's, and whomever I could find. Once a GM called me they said the sales manager did nothing wrong as dealer accessories don't have to say anything about market adjustment legally. I was miffed as I stated I wouldn't be upset if They didn't try to explain to me that the dealer installed features wasn't the reasoning for the higher price. They told me it was my fault for not asking them when they technically gave me the information. On the contract it only lists the higher price, no market adjustment or other real line items.

I also have $5668 on an Affirm purchase, but if I pay off now I will only pay $3500 and save the difference in interest. Both loans/debts have a very similar interest rate (terrible). My tax return can pay off one fully but I’m not sure which one to do. I really hate spending big chunks of money, but this feels right to do. 

If I pay off the Affirm account, then I will also pay off a student loan as well. But for some reason that affirm account isn’t on my credit report, so paying it off will not help my credit score (hovering just a hair below 700 currently). We are looking to buy a house in the not so distant future so that’s something I’m considering as well. 

If I pay off the credit card, then my credit score will jump about 60 points. 

The other option (the one I am leaning towards) is pay off the Affirm account, and then use the rest on my credit card and continue to pay aggressively on it. 

For reference, my tax return was $7500. I have $17k in savings currently as well. So yes I could technically pay off both, but would rather just pay aggressively on one and keep my savings.

3. Reports say Solana went down again for several hours on January 4th, 2022. Maybe this is a strategy to normalize the idea of “decentralized blockchains” that can be turned on and off at will.

8. Liqwid Community Call #4 happened on Jan 5, 2022.

27. Seabug has dropped a new medium article on their protocol for self-governed NFTs. This may turn out to be somewhat controversial to some since it may be seen as diminishing the unimpinged bearer bond like status of a crypto token issued under the protocol in exchange for theft protection. Many will like that. Some will not. Mlabs is mentioning a late February release for the actual NFT marketplace.

45. Alessandro gives us a big update on exactly what was going on with Nami wallet over the last few days (blockfrost mempools full) and how Blockfrost has gone about fixing it (spun up more nodes…30 now…with more mempools).

52. Looks like no SudaeSwap rewards today and no calculator yet (as of writing on Jan. 25). But, there is a calculator coming and the rewards will now be via DripDropz.

They will also be adding various stats to the pools including queue depth. [https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1486030734267764747](https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1486030734267764747)

personalfinance,From bankruptcy... An opportunity?,"Hi all!

I'm a 34 yo Spanish citizen doing my medical internship in France. I have around 300€ disposable income every month, a value that increases with every year of internship.

I have a 10k expence coming up that I have no way of avoiding... And I have absolutely no way of meeting that obligation.

I am currently considering juggling various options:
1) taking a 15k loan from banks/assurance companies (MACSF or LCL) at an historically low interest rate. Spend the 10k, invest the rest (in an ET perhaps?).

2) asking my mother for a 10k, no interest rate loan I'd pay after the residency.

3) asking my wife for a 10k, no interest loan I'd have to pay during the residency.

A combination of 1, 2, and 3, such as:
4) asking for a variable percentage of 1 and 2 or 3.

5) asking for 1 and 5k from 2 and 5k from 3.

6) asking for 5k from 2 and 5k from 3.

I am uneasy about asking anyone for money: I left my parent's home when I was 18 and paid all my way through med school and life beyond until recently, when I've had another big expense that erased my significant savings (30k-ish). (Not gambling or any vice btw).

I'm already looking into financial aids and cost saving measures available to me in France but being a foreigner and social security moving at glacial speed here, I'm on my own.

I figured since I'm going to have to ask for a loan, might as well try to use part of it to invest and build some wealth. What do you think? Thank you for reading this far!",finance,1644305958.0

stocks,My individual picks are up nearly 4% YTD while index funds are down.,"VTI is down 7% YTD.  QQQ is down 12%.  My portfolio of individual picks is up 3.85%.

I just want to put this here as an ""I told you so"" to the people who told me this was stupid, and also as a learning piece for people who are just starting out and trying to sort through the noise (there's a lot of it).

Long-term, if you're making regular contributions to VTI, I'm not really into a position to criticize that.  History has proven it works.  But as Jeremy Grantham says, there's been numerous times in history, too, where you've had to wait 10, 20, or 30 years just to break even (there's a great interview of him on YouTube with Bloomberg, this sub won't let me link it).  Furthermore, part of the reason we've recovered so easily from crashes in the last couple of decades is because central banks keep jacking down interest rates further and further.  How much lower can we go?

I understand that this a long-term game, and we're not even 2 months into the year yet.  But given the uncertainty around monetary policy right now, and cheap money coming to an end, I think it's reasonable to expect that indexes will continue to underperform.  Perhaps after an amazing liquidity-fueled bull run of a decade and a half, last year was NOT the time to dump your money into a market-tracking index fund.

Like many people here, last year was my first year investing seriously.  What I put into the market last year represented a very large lump sum to me, and one that I may never replicate again in my life.  I could not afford to dump it into an index fund at all-time highs only to have it tank immediately.  For that reason I looked for strong companies trading at discounts or reasonable valuations, as well as companies that paid reliable dividends.  I chose a conservative approach that would almost guarantee consistent compounding in the coming years and decades.  People told me that I was wrong and downvoted me, yet here we are in February 2022 and my portfolio is overperforming while the market struggles.

I think the advice of index funds is great when you have people buying hype companies, companies with no earnings, or for general clueless beginners who get themselves into trouble because they don't know what they're doing.  But I think the mantra of ""just put it in VTI"" has become a bit brainless, and even with VTI, there's no such thing as a free lunch.  You have to know what you're doing, and an index fund is no substitute for investing knowledge.",finance,1644313699.0

CryptoCurrency,Nexo founder: 'Cheap money' due to inflation benefits crypto,"The founder of cryptocurrency lender Nexo, Antoni Trenchev, does not expect the U.S. central bank to ultimately take drastic steps to combat inflation in the country. [In an interview with CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX5MWZzj0UE), Trenchev revealed that he expects ""cheap money"" to continue to exist for this reason. This is subsequently very good news for the crypto industry, according to Trenchev.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cheap money and crypto**

Trenchev expects that the US Federal Reserve will not put its money where its mouth is when it comes to tightening monetary policy. There were rumors that the body was going to implement interest rate increases to minimize inflation in the country, but more and more analysts are skeptical about possible measures. Trenchev also assumes that there will be no drastic interest rate increases. This basically means that ""cheap money,"" as Trenchev calls it, will continue to exist, and this in turn could benefit the crypto industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*""You know I've been very skeptical about the actions of the Federal Reserve and the proposed interest rate increases and how that will ultimately unfold. My view is that cheap money is here to stay, and this is very good for assets like crypto,""*

personalfinance,Sell or rent my house?,"UPDATE -

Based on the great feedback below, I have decided that I will sell my house, and not rent it out as an absentee landlord. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Original message below

&amp;#x200B;

How do I decide whether to sell or rent out my house? What factors are important?

I am a federal employee. I have been given permission to relocate and work from permanently. I will be moving 2 and half hours north to be closer to family. I will be renting a house owned by my brother.

My salary will go down, and my rent (replacing mortgage) will increase. But my quality of life will go up substantially. I can easily afford the lower income and higher living cost. I will continue to contribute the max to my TSP (27k) and Roth (7K) with no consumer debt.

I owe $294k (3.35% mortgage) on a 38 year old town home which is worth between $415-440k in the hot Northern Virginia market. I think I can get $2300-$2500 in rent. If I rent, I need to replace the flooring in the basement, repaint, and do some minor repairs. If I sell, I probably need to replace the roof as well as the other costs.

Option A - Sell house

I immediately collect $100k from the sale which would be invested in index funds through dollar cost averaging over 1.5 years.  I lose all the tax advantages of home ownership, plus the home as an asset.

Option B - Rent House

I don't collect any money from the sale of the house, and possibly go without tenants for 6 weeks (guestimate) while paying rent and mortgage. Cash flow increases. Mortgage plus escrow and HOA is $1874, estimate of rental income is $2350 (minus whatever extras I have to pay for management, etc.)

I don't know anything about home ownership to landlord tax impacts. I would maintain the house as an asset which diversifies my investments (which otherwise would be all index funds). Will I need to refinance the house or can I keep the old mortgage?

I will travel multiple times a year to the area the house is in. I will certainly check on the house if I am in town and a landlord. Can I write any of the travel off?",finance,1644326584.0

Do you know how much the prices are higher than last year or pre covid?
Could it be much cheaper after the supply chain issues after covid?
Should be at the end of the year. I guess the prices will stay high.

# [Stock futures inch higher after S&amp;P, Nasdaq fall to start the week](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/07/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were mixed in morning trading Tuesday as the market awaits key inflation data later this week.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both edged lower.
*****
&gt; In early news, Peloton shares fell 2.8% premarket after the interactive fitness company said it will slash 2,800 jobs in a restructuring effort that will see CEO John Foley step down and transition to executive chair.
*****
&gt; The company will report earnings Tuesday after the market closes and during what’s been a turbulent time for the company. The stock surged 20.9% on Monday following reports the company could be a takeover target.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Harley Davidson jumped 6% after the company reported a surprise profit for the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; Also, Pfizer shares tumbled 4% after the drugmaker’s fourth-quarter revenue came in lower than Wall Street analysts expected. The company’s full-year earnings guidance also disappointed.
*****
&gt; Shares of Snap fell 3.5% after the social media company announced a new debt offering.
*****
&gt; On the economic calendar, investors will get a look at December’s trade balance, with a Dow Jones survey pointing to an $82.8 billion shortfall, which would be a record.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is on edge watching how the Federal Reserve will react to the intensifying price pressures. Bank of America on Monday reiterated its call for the Fed to hike rates 1.75 percentage points, or seven times, this year in an effort to head off inflation pressures which have been accelerated by rising rages.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields hit fresh pandemic-era highs Monday and rose again Tuesday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently yielded 1.93%, a level not seen since January 2020.
*****
&gt; During trading on Monday the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.58%. Both traded higher earlier in the day, before reversing course during the final hour of trading. Each index managed to close above its worst level of the session, however.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial finished Monday’s trading session just 1 point higher. At one point the 30-stock benchmark had added 235 points. At the lows of the day, the Dow declined by about 95 points.
*****
&gt; “U.S. stocks will struggle for direction until the latest inflation tilts market’s expectations as to how aggressive the Fed will tighten into what is still deemed as an overvalued stock market,” said Oanda’s Edward Moya.
*****
&gt; On Thursday the Labor Department will release January’s consumer price index data. The reading follows a stronger-than-expected January jobs report, which has led to speculation that the Federal Reserve could be more aggressive when it comes to hiking rates. The inflation data is expected to show that prices rose 0.4% in January, for a 7.2% gain from one year ago, which would be the highest in almost 40 years.
*****
&gt; “The tumultuous market action continues as the combination of Fed policy uncertainty and economic transition remains in focus,” Canaccord Genuity said Monday in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; “Unfortunately, this is the environment we are going to be in for a while as the monetary and economic mid-cycle transition unfolds.”
*****
&gt; Communications services was the worst-performing S&amp;P 500 sector on Monday, declining 2.2% amid a 5% dip for shares of Facebook-parent Meta. Shares of the social media giant are down 28% this month following the company’s disappointing earnings report.
*****
&gt; Google-parent Alphabet slid 2.9%, while Twitter, Match Group and Netflix all shed roughly 2%.
*****
&gt; “Technology stocks are no longer a one-way trade as investors cut losses and now focus on valuations, competition, and long-term outlooks,” added Oanda’s Moya.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Tuesday with Pfizer, Harley-Davidson, Lyft, Chipotle and Yum China among the names set to post quarterly results.
*****
&gt; As of Monday afternoon, 281 S&amp;P 500 components have reported, with 78% exceeding earnings estimates and 77% topping revenue expectations, according to FactSet.

personalfinance,Need some tax advice,"Me and my husband file jointly. I had a small seasonal job part time, as well as a full time job. He has just one full time job. I guess on my W4 for my seasonal job I messed up and they didn't take ANY federal taxes out. From October to January I only made about 1500. 


We also moved states, Florida to Kentucky and sold our home (only made 3k, we had only lived there for about 3 years). I am also a registered tribal member and got an extra stimmy check. Im unsure if I need to claim that. 


So we started to file and we currently owe the state 11.00 and the feds 1500 lol. My income did jump up by 2/hr in November. Is it because I messed up my W4 I have to pay back the money I made at my part time job? Can we pay this with a credit card because I can't come up with 1500 cash right away. How long do we have to pay? Can we go to jail over this? We usually don't get a refund back, and if we do it's like a couple hundred. I'm changing my W4 to be set up to take an extra hundred out every paycheck because I'm terrified.",finance,1644331075.0
personalfinance,Upgrade cash back visa credit line?,"Hey, I have not seen good things about this card.. its more of a personal loan, the available credit doesn't get reported as credit. It doesn't seem like the type of card you pay off every month?

However, I am tempted to get the $400 sign on bonus, but I have to sign up for a checking account with them. I'm okay with that because I need one for my ebay side business.

So my question is: what would I use this card for? Can I use it for inventory for my business? I only have a 624 score so I assume I will be closer to the 29.99% interest rate, so I am thinking it might not be worth using it, but can I just finesse them to get the bonus then keep it on the sidelines? Or should I just go for a different card that will help my credit more? (I need to build my credit, but already have a house/car so won't need better credit for 5+ years).",finance,1644331812.0

Long time lurker here! First I would like to say thanks for any advice or just reading! I am a 25 year old living in a recently growing HCOL area of Arizona. I make about $80,000 a year and paid off both my car and student loans (~$30,000) last year. This limits a lot of my down payment money.

I am currently maxing out my 401k to hit the $20,000 (company adds an additional 4%) a year mark and only adding in about $150-$200 a month to my ROTH IRA. My fiancé is finishing up medical school so I am also supporting us financially through this.

My main concern is if I should be putting less money into my retirement and more aside into a house savings fund, or if I continue down this path. I am worried with the housing market and rising interest rates that the longer I wait the less available becoming a homeowner becomes. Just feel a little trapped and don’t know what decision would be smarter.

I am getting my degree for Medical Laboratory Science. My tuition bill was paid in full in January. Some came from federal loans, and I paid the rest out of pocket. Yesterday I received an email from the financial services office stating I exceeded my undergraduate federal loan limit by $2,629 and that I need to pay this balance immediately or I will be dropped from my classes. Since the semester is half over, they won't let me sign up for a payment plan. I don't have $2,629 just laying around though. I have applied for a private loan through Sallie Mae but I'm not sure if that will be approved. Can they do this though? It doesn't seem fair that I'm being penalized because the employee who submits the federal aid loan requests overshot my eligibility, correct? I guess what I'm asking here is: 

1. Does anyone know if I have any options I can pursue?
2. Is it possible to argue this balance? (I was told by their office that it is not, but I don't know if that's accurate or she just didn't want me to protest it)
3. How is it legal for them to do this? It's my final semester, my last 2 classes and now, half way through the semester I suddenly have to come up with $2629?
4. Can I submit a complaint against the school for this? It feels predatory, but maybe I'm being dramatic.

This is a gerrymandered-blue district, so the primary election on March 1 (Early Vote Feb 14-25) will decide the representative. AMA!","***9:45 PM Thanks to everyone who asked questions!***

**My name is Donna Imam. I’m a computer engineer and Democrat running for US Congress in Austin’s new Congressional District.**

I started my career as the first female design engineer hired in the 100 year history of Duncan Metering. Since then I’ve led product lines from computers used by millions, to microprocessors found in everything from washing machines to commercial jets. Later, I founded my tech consulting firm.

In 2020, I ran for Congress in Austin to bring practical solutions for our community and our country. We won the Democratic nomination with the highest turnout in the history of the district by taking our message directly to the voters.

I served as president of a 4000+ member Austin nonprofit that provides free training and education to boost people’s careers and paychecks. We helped thousands, but I realized we need to do more. As a 15+ year resident of our district and active volunteer in our community, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges that working Texans face — that’s why I’m running.

**BOLD NEW LEADERSHIP**

For the first time in decades, Austin Democrats have the opportunity to send a new representative to Congress to champion Medicare-for-All and debt-free-education. We need leadership with expertise in technology to deliver solutions for future generations.

**DIVERSE REPRESENTATION**

95% of the population growth in Texas in the last decade was Hispanic, Black and Asian Americans. We need representation that reflects the community that Austin has become. Our campaign is expanding the electorate by building a coalition of all Texans — that’s how we win and take back Texas.

**YOUR VOICE MATTERS**

Primary elections have low voter participation so your vote will have a tremendous impact. This race will be decided in the Democratic primary so it’s important to make your voice heard now. If you're in Austin, Vote Donna Imam and together we can build a brighter future for all of us in the new TX-37.

**TOP 3 AREAS OF MY PLATFORM:**

* **Housing** — Establish a uniform, federally funded response to homelessness nationwide.
* **Healthcare** —  A single-payer solution that fortifies and accelerates Medicare for All (M4A), drastically lowering the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs.
* **Education** — Ensure everyone in the United States can go to college, trade schools, or certification programs without being in debt forever.

The payment plan is in 60 installments of about $1800. I already paid the first four, but interest accrues every month.

I am wondering if it's possible to get a loan in the US to pay for debt abroad. The reason is to avoid higher interest rates abroad (~11% yearly).

There's also the variable interest rate to add in the equation.

stocks,Consumer debt totals $15.6 trillion after a record-breaking increase in 2021,"Consumers ended 2021 with record levels of debt, leading into a year in which interest rates are expected to rise substantially. Total debt at the end of the year came to $15.6 trillion, an increase of $333 billion in the fourth quarter and just over $1 trillion for the year, according to data released Tuesday from the Federal Reserve’s New York district. The quarterly rise was the biggest since 2007, and the annual gain was the largest ever in records going back to 2003. The increases came ahead of a period in which the Fed is expected to start jacking up interest rates as it looks to tamp down inflation running at its fastest pace in nearly 40 years. Markets expect the central bank to start hiking rates in March and to enact at least five increases this year totaling 1.25 percentage points. Fed interest moves are directly tied to the prime rate that consumers pay for many forms of debt, including credit cards and adjustable-rate mortgages.

A large chunk of the debt load increase came from mortgages, which saw balances rise by $890 billion for the year and $258 billion in the fourth quarter, to nearly $11 trillion. Mortgage originations for the year totaled more than $4.5 trillion, a new record. Credit card balances increased by $52 billion in the final three months of the year, a new quarterly record that brought total debt in that category to $860 billion. Owning to the rapid gain in prices, auto loan balances rose by $90 billion, or 6.6%, to $1.46 trillion. New auto prices rose 11.8% for the year while used vehicles soared by 37.3%, according to Labor Department data.

One area that saw little increase was student loans, which edged higher by just $20 billion for the year and actually declined marginally in the fourth quarter. Forbearance programs, though mostly expired, are still keeping balances and delinquencies in check. New York Fed researchers saw the rising-rate environment could affect household cash flows as borrowers adjust. Those who locked in at low mortgage rates, for instances, are likely to be reluctant to go out and buy new homes with rates moving higher, while those who ran up credit card balances could be constrained as financing costs increase.

personalfinance,Tax basis calculation for rental property sale,"I had a rental property for about 10 years that I sold in 2021. I’m struggling to figure out how to calculate the sale of the property, specifically with regard to the cost of property or tax basis plus the expenses of the sale. I do my own taxes using TurboTax, this is the last section I need to do so I’d rather not have to take the whole thing to an accountant at this point if I can figure this out. When I put in what I thought were the correct numbers in to TurboTax on form 4797, I was told I owed nearly $50,000 in federal taxes after showing a refund of a few thousand before this input. This seemed odd as I didn’t even net $50,000 from the sale and didn’t expect to pay more than 100% federal income tax on the profits. I realize the tax burden will be higher due to capital gains and depreciation recapture, but that seemed ridiculous.

Basic details:

•Netted almost $50,000 from the sale (total sale price of $250,000)

•Put in $22,000 worth of work to the home in 2021 to mitigate water damage and make general improvements prior to selling

•Took ~$40,000 in depreciation during the course of the time this property was a rental

Can anyone assist me in figuring out how to calculate the cost basis? I’m pretty lost and I’d really rather not owe $50,000 in federal taxes. Should I bite the bullet and visit an accountant for this, or am I missing something here that is causing the taxes on this sale to be so high? Thank you for any assistance you can provide!

altcoin,"BitcoinZ got listed on Whitebit. Find information, historical data and future plans of BTCZ in this post.","BitcoinZ (BTCZ) had a surprise listing in WhiteBIT, a top35 and fast-growing #Cryptocurrency Exchange and becomes one of the hottest crypto of the New Year

BitcoinZ with its fair launch &amp; pure crypto fundamentals (no premine, 100% PoW) is completely immune to scams and “rug pulls”. Because there wasn’t any founder allocating any coins to his addresses.

People who wish to register in WhiteBIT exchange can use this invitation from the BITCOINZ Community.

Why WhiteBIT?

WhiteBIT is one of the top35 exchanges with more than half a billion $ daily volume, presence in 190+ countries, 2 million users and  400 trading pairs.

In addition, it is a very fast-growing exchange, climbing to higher positions in the lists of the best exchanges, during the last 3 years.

WhiteBIT is based in Estonia, and it is a licensed crypto CEX supporting many payment methods. Deposits and withdrawals are possible with Visa and MasterCard, as well as Advcash, Qiwi, Mercuryo, Geo-Pay, Interkassa, monobank and Perfect Money.

The fact that fiat currency deposits are permitted also makes this exchange an “entry-level exchange”, meaning an exchange where new crypto investors can take their first steps into the exciting crypto world.

At last but not least, this trading platform stores 96% of all assets in cold storage. As with most other exchanges, the user can also enable two-factor authentication to log in. There are also IP-detection features, biometrics confirmation and more. All in all, WhiteBIT seems to focus on security.

&amp;#x200B;

Positive Reviews

Most people in crypto possibly already know that building a good name in the crypto exchange industry is not the easier thing.

Many clients don’t understand how to use their crypto assets. Or there are fraudulent people who write negative reviews in order to advertise “specialized services in recovering funds” etc and all these result in many negative reviews even for popular exchanges like Binance or Kucoin.

Despite this fact, WhiteBIT makes it to be among the top performers in the most reviewing platforms like TrustPilot or CryptocurrencyExchanges. At the same time, it enjoys top-rated reviews for its apple or android apps. These complete the image of a reputable exchange that can really partner with a pure cryptocurrency project like BITCOINZ and help it jump to the next level.

What about BITCOINZ ? Why it has this impressive uptrend for weeks even during a general cryptocurrency bear market ?

&amp;#x200B;

There are four main reasons behind this move.

&amp;#x200B;

\- BITCOINZ had three listings in 2022: In TradeOgre, Exbitron and now in WhiteBIT exchange.

\-The Project presented a new Dynamic Roadmap on 22-January-2022 in the Z-Brain Meeting of the BITCOINZ Community. The new Roadmap can be found in the main page of the Project.

\- BITCOINZ is in a development frenzy recently with new developers joining its Community and many nice advancements in the Project's ecosystem like the BITCOINZ-DEX , the Army-Z , the Connect-Z and more.

\- Most importantly, BITCOINZ is a pure cryptocurrency network that follows all the fundamentals that the classic Bitcoin introduced for years, with many extra advantages.

&amp;#x200B;

How BITCOINZ differs from the classic Bitcoin without breaking the classic fundamentals ?

&amp;#x200B;

BITCOINZ (BTCZ) was launched in 2017 and is a pure cryptocurrency that offers solutions to all the five “flaws” of the legendary Bitcoin :

1) Its scalability offered higher transaction speed and more transactions per second

2) BITCOINZ’s high maximum supply is the ideal for easier prices without long non integer numbers.

3) The 21B coin supply, in combination with the much more transactions per second, guarantees super low, next to zero fees even if it had the BTC cap and network load. BitcoinZ is ideal for transferring even very small sums of under $10 with \~0% cost.

4) BITCOINZ’s ASIC resistant Zhash algorithm protects the PC miners from the ASIC elites. This way it achieves a Decentralized Network with truly fair distribution of coins to the world Community. Not to the rich people owning an ASIC device.

5) BITCOINZ features private transactions, offering true privacy for everyone.

6) (extra) BITCOINZ is a green Proof of Work Network since a) it utilizes a much more energy efficient algo than BTC b) the users can use their PCs for other activities while mining BTCZ because only the GPU is (mildly) used for the process and c) it supports more transactions per second with plenty of space for future upgrades.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, BITCOINZ fulfils all the fundamentals of a pure cryptocurrency :

1) It was founded by anonymous founders, and it is a 100% Community Driven project, with no central authority issuing coins.

2) 100% of its coin supply is distributed to its network’s supporters (miners) with the Proof of Work model. Everyone if free to join it with the mining procedure using just a PC.

3) It had the fairest launch ever with absolutely no premine, no initial coin offerings and no instamine period (something that is questionable even for Bitcoin).

4) It is an asset that acts as a hedge against inflation because it has a fixed maximum supply and reduced coin emission over time with fair and slow mining halving plan, every 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Why BITCOINZ uses the ""BITCOIN"" name and why it is really different from the so many projects that used it.

&amp;#x200B;

BITCOINZ used the ""BITCOIN"" name adding a Z because it honoured and followed all the aforementioned fundamentals that the classic BITCOIN introduced (fair rules, 100% Community Driven, 100% Decentralized, 100% Proof of Work) and at the same time it offed Zero fees, only PC-mining with its Zhash algorithm and optional privacy based on the Zk-snarks cryptography. So there was no better name to describe all these than ""BITCOIN+Z"".

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth mentioning that BITCOINZ is the oldest and maybe the only ""BITCOIN"" named project that can still be mined with a normal PC, and it is not a Bitcoin blockchain fork since it had its own genesis block.

&amp;#x200B;

Other crypto projects that have used the ""Bitcoin"" name, did it afterwards, in a misleading way, or they are just copies of the BITCOIN's blockchain (blockchain-forks) that have given free coins (forkdrops) to the Bitcoin holders. In such a way, these ""BITCOIN"" named projects try to enjoy a high free exposure by distributing coins to the BITCOIN owners. Sometimes bad actors from the BITCOIN chain-fork projects even steal the private keys from the BTC owners that try to claim their free coins in the BTC-forks.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, BITCOINZ had its own unique blockchain exactly like Bitcoin did and never made any forkdrops. Offering equal opportunities to everyone by distributing the 100% of its supply to the whole world Community and not to a closed team. Exactly like a real cryptocurrency should be destined to do, being a gift of Freedom and Equality.

&amp;#x200B;

A Conclusion for the cryptocurrency moves of the last month

&amp;#x200B;

As a conclusion, the moves that we saw during the last month are a trend and not a random event.

The biggest victims of this new downtrend are the very overvalued cryptocurrencies and the DeFi projects, especially their tokens because of the hyper-inflation and the many useless meme/scam projects.

BITCOINZ, being among the most classic, pure mineable projects with many advantages over Bitcoin, fixed supply and the most fair rules ever, makes it to surprise everyone acting as a hedge against inflation, questionable crypto and scam tokens.

But is that all? What else do I need to think about? 

Here's a hypothetical house me and my gf might look to buy.

house price: $350k

down payment: 20% (exempts from mortgage insurance I believe?)

loan amt: 280k

loan term: 30yrs

interest rate est: 3.99%

monthly mortage payment: $1335

Est monthly property tax: $292

Est monthly homeowners ins: $150

Est monthly repair and upkeep: $290

total monthly rent equivalent: $2067

Does this all make sense? Am I forgetting anything? I suppose there could be hoa fees but I'd rather not move somewhere with an hoa.

Me and my gf pay over $2500/month right now so this hypothetical house would be very doable.

EDIT2: thanks for the help on property taxes, just looked at a 355k house on zillow in the area we're looking and they estimated $2320/yr in property taxes so $193/mo so I'm actually on the higher side in my estimate.",finance,1644347979.0

1. ""While Americans bear the burden of pricey Covid tests, pharma and retailers are raking in billions.
Testing is a pricey habit... especially for people with lower incomes. Free testing is available to everyone in the US through 20K government sites (or 1 per ~17K people). But with hours-long lines at free sites, many are turning to lab tests, which can cost $200+, or $25 home kits. Some of the corporations benefiting:
•	Retailers: Kroger and Walmart have hiked prices on at-home tests (from $14 for a two-pack to $24). Meanwhile, Walgreens raised its forecast after notching $3.6B in quarterly profit, as shoppers rushed in for at-home and on-site swabs.
•	Test makers: Rapid tests can cost a few dollars to make, but companies like Abbott and Quidel have seen stunning sales. Abbott tripled quarterly profits last year after its BinaxNow Covid self-test kit became a top seller.
•	Lab companies, which process PCR tests: Labcorp’s profit surged by 40%, to $4.2B, in the first nine months of 2021. When the testing boom started, in late 2020, Quest Diagnostic’s quarterly profit doubled while Abbotts’ tripled.""

2. ""Oil giants notch stunning profits as gas prices soar — now they’re paying investors
Gas prices are up 50% from a year ago and oil is near a seven-year high. That's hurting your wallet but helping energy giants. Last quarter, Exxon's sales climbed over 80% from a year ago, to a slick $85B. Annual profit hit $23B, the highest since 2014. Last week Chevron also reported its highest yearly profit since 2014. Shell and BP report this week.""

3. ""Ship: UPS raised its dividend to $1.52, the largest hike since its 1999 IPO, as higher shipping fees drove big profits last quarter. Meanwhile, rival FedEx suspended its US freight services because of staffing shortages.""
-----------------------------------------
My thoughts on this: 

I'm not understanding how oil companies and shipping
companies are profiting from price increases of their products and services. I thought the price increases were to offset losses, and so it ensures they keep making about the same amount of revenue...unless way more people are buying fuel and shipping services...? 
Any increase in prices of materials/supplies for manufacturing comapanies'products/services is always passed to the consumer. 
I can understand a company making more for selling more products/services, But this saying that companies
Are raising prices just to pay themselves more at the expense of consumers…is this not completely unethical?
I mean, I guess this has been going on since corporations began, but it's just now hitting me...Pharma and health
Retailers raking in big profits because of the demand of covid tests, but are the price increases because of an actual shortage, to encourage rationing, or because they're taking advantage of the demand for the tests?
Same thing with the oil companies, gas prices are the highest they've been in years….I thought it was for a reason, because perhaps oil companies are strained and need to offset losses, there's not enough production to meet demand, OPEC is not distributing as many barrels as they could be, so American oil companies have to raise prices to offset the losses. How then, are they 'notching stunning profits?"" Perhaps they've decided to pay themselves a bit extra for the actual losses they incurred during the shutdowns of 2020?

Fortress Investment Group co-CEO Peter Briger, Georgetown University Law Center professor Chris Brummer, Weizmann Institute of Science professor Shafi Goldwasser, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Timothy Massad, MIT Sloan School of Management finance professor Antoinette Schoar, and MIT Digital Currency Initiative director Neha Narula will be joining the PayPal initiative.

“We believe it is crucial to engage with the world’s best leaders to better understand the industry’s most compelling opportunities and complex challenges,” said Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal’s senior vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto, and digital currencies.

All six advisers carry years of experience from the crypto and blockchain space from a business or regulatory perspective. Briger was reportedly the one responsible for advising Softbank Group founder Masayoshi Son to invest millions in Bitcoin (BTC) prior to the 2017 bull run. Goldwasser was part of a group of MIT researchers who proposed zero-knowledge proof as an encryption scheme long before the advent of crypto.

During her time with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Narula has been in charge of an initiative to help the federal reserve bank of Boston build a digital currency aimed at scaling for consumer use. Brummer was reportedly a candidate for CFTC chair before President Joe Biden officially nominated Rostin Behnam. Massad, who served as CFTC chair from 2014 to 2017, argued after he left his position that regulators should approve an exchange-traded fund offering exposure to BTC.

personalfinance,New credit card vs mortgage applications,"Not sure what to pick for flair; went with ""housing"" as this is mostly a ""I'm hoping to be in the housing market soon as a first time buyer, should I wait on this other thing"" question.

So, short version, I've been building my credit for a while. For the first time ever, Credit Karma (yes, yes, I know) reported over 800 a few weeks ago. I have about 45K in debt spread across car and student loans, but nothing on credit cards (of which I have 2 - one ""normal"" and one CareCredit specialized.) No delinquencies, no hard hits. Great work history, software manager salary.

I live in an extremely competitive market, and am hoping to get the absolute best possible deal on a mortgage vis-a-vis interest rates. Long-time renter, first time owner (hopefully.) I have not started this process but intend to in the next, say, two months. I have no illusions that I'll be able to actually find a home in those two months, but I'd like to get some pre-approvals going for mortgages. It'll likely take the better part of a year to actually find a place.

I use YNAB for budgeting (it is in no small part how I got where I am) and unfortunately some time last year they did something in their backend that caused automatic imports for my credit card to stop working. Since I pay the card down and get bonus points for purchasing I use it for pretty much everything, which means a fair number of transactions that I now have to manually copy into my YNAB ledger. The volume of transactions makes this a bigger chore than I'd like, and I actually haven't looked at my YNAB budget in months as a consequence. I've gone back and forth with both YNAB support and my bank, but unfortunately due to how my bank handles single sign-on, getting automatic import back isn't going to happen. So I'm looking at getting a new card.

Obviously keeping the existing card helps my credit limits. I have a small recurring payment I can put on the card to keep it active. Any new card would similarly help credit limits. But it would also be a hard hit on my score, would take two years before it starts to drop off, and might impact my mortgage prospects. Question is, how much?

Should I go for a new card now, or should I wait until after I purchase a home? If I were to get a new credit card, how badly might the hard hit impact my score, and my ability to secure a good mortgage?",finance,1644357881.0

personalfinance,Mortgage rate lock now?,"Looking for some advice here.....Our home is being built and has a projected close date of 4/25/22, but of course nothing is set in stone with all the supply issues for builders. Nonetheless, drywall is up so I guess we're in the home stretch. I'm trying to figure out my best bet for the loan. End of last week, I had an offer of 3.8% for a 120day lock (which I'm being advised we'll need, to give about a month cushion for more build delays). My plan over the weekend, was to wait until the end of February, when I could lock in a 90 day rate, which of course would be a bit lower. I think a 90 day last week was 3.75%. Today my 90day lock rate is 3.99.

So basically, I'm trying to figure out if I should give the market a couple of days, or weeks, to possibly drop, or if I should be locking something in NOW. I understand no one can predict what the market is going to do, but I have very little experience in this field, so I'm looking for some seasoned advice on what my best bet is here, given what I hear about the Fed increasing at their mid-march meeting",finance,1644359442.0

personalfinance,Is a debt settlement plan a good idea?,"I have about 24k in credit card debt over two cards. One is an Amex with ~$18k with a whopping 29% APR and the other is a Visa through my credit union with ~$6k and an 11% APR. I feel like I’m drowning. 

I live in California and went to CaliforniaDebtRelief.org and filled out a relief request with them. I received a call from Clear One Advantage and the representative wants to set me up with a Debt Settlement Plan. 

It sounded good until he got to the part where he told me I had to stop paying my credit card bills. This terrifies me. I’m at the point where he wants to set me up with a 36 month plan where they negotiate a settlement for me with a 25% fee claiming that they can lower my debt by 40-60% and that my credit score will begin to build again after those 36 months. 

My score is ok, right now, not awful 617, I think. I don’t want it to tank.

I’ve looked into credit consolidation loans, but they’re interest rates are quite high (not as high as Amex though) and I’ll wind up paying a lot extra to take that route. I can also get a much smaller personal loan through my credit union for $8000 with an 11% APR.  

How I see it, these are my options:

I go with the debt settlement plan where I’m locked into monthly payments on a settlement that ruins my credit, but could potentially save me around $6,000.
 
I get a loan for $24,000 with an interest rate ~15% and completely pay off both of my cards and have one monthly payment.

I get two loans totaling $18,000. One from my CU for $8000 with the lower APR and another for $10,000 with a higher APR to pay off the Amex then continue to make monthly payments on my lower interest rate card. That’s three debt payments a month.

I get a loan for $18,000 with an interest rate of around ~15% and pay off the Amex while continuing to pay my lower interest rate card monthly. Leaving me with two monthly bills.

I’m overwhelmed and the Debt Settlement Plan is giving me a bad feeling, but I’m not sure if that’s because it’s a big change or if it’s because it’s a bad deal. I really need some advice.",finance,1644363142.0

personalfinance,Help! Just start a new job and medical insurance is outrageous. $944/paycheck,"Edit: thank you to everyone who provided input. Spoiler! When you get an interview remember you are also the interviewer. I hope someone can learn from my mistake.

Hey all! Never post anything but I just learned something and I’m having a small breakdown. As the title says bcbs shows the family ppo rate at $944 and I get paid biweekly. This can’t be right can it? I literally can’t think of what else to say. Just started working and it’s only my second day, I don’t know what to do or think now; feeling super disappointed.

Edit: after a few hours of research with the help of comments but the news is still bad. The ppo plan is the most expensive and there is hmo plan but only for Idaho. There are two different high deductible plans but for the family the cheapest one is at $657 every two weeks. The company will allow you to combine the HD plan with hsa but the company match is like $10/pay period. 
Here’s the real kicker! The ppo plan for only me is $192/biweekly which I can afford. 
I will update if I learn anything of importance in the matter but in the meantime, don’t be like me during an interview and only ask who the provider is. Ask for the exact amounts of cost because this could be single biggest perk or drawback of your potential new employer.

P.S.
I talked to some important people today and thought it was interesting enough to post on here. 
To keep anonymity I will keep this very vague. 
First person asked about any concerns I have and I mentioned the family ppo was disappointing. Then they mentioned we could talk to HR to negotiate but she didn’t use the word negotiate. 
Second person mentioned on his own accord, how the single rate is normal but that he can’t compete with other companies when it comes to family packages.

Idk if I explained myself clearly but I took away something very clearly today. The second person I talked to was the person who provided our contract and are also responsible for our medical plans.

CryptoCurrency,Fascinating events leading up to the Bitfinex hack arrests.,"Credit to @Jack Niewold

In August 2016, a (still unknown) hacker gained access to the exchange, allowing them to authorize around 2000 unapproved transactions.

They stole 119,754 $BTC, then worth about ~$72 million. It tanked the market by nearly 40%

What happened next? It's unclear, but those coins were likely sold in a P2P/OTC deal between the hacker and a third party.

It was just another one of several previous (smaller) hacks of Bitfinex, and in the eyes of the public, the exchange never really regained rust.

Although most customers hadn't been hacked, the exchange slashed account balances across the platform by 36% to stay solvent.

To even out this account rebalancing, losses were reimbursed in the Bitfinex exchange token, LEO.

Remember this--it's important.

Nothing much happened publicly until 2020, when Bitfinex put up a bounty of $400 million for the now $1.3 billion in missing $BTC.

The hacked Bitcoin moved around a bit, but no one was able to trace it back to any identity.

On January 31st, on-chain observers began to see strange activity around the wallets holding the funds from the hack.

It seemed strange to many observers as the funds were consolidating without any privacy-seeking behavior (mixing, use of Monero, Tornado Cash).

Today, the DOJ announced that the hacked $BTC, now worth $3.6 billion had been recovered.

No one had ever really lost track of the $BTC even as those controlling the wallets had tried to hide their trail using now-defunct AlphaBay, Monero, and gift cards.

Although they knew where the funds were, they didn't yet know who was behind the hack or how to recover them.

Tracing exchange accounts to India-based emails, they linked the $BTC to the business and personal accounts of two people: Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan.

Now that they had identities, they got a warrant to break into the cloud data provider account of Lichtenstein, a dual-citizen of Russia and the US.

Lucky for the DOJ, Ilya stored the private keys in plain text on that service, which contained the $3.6 billion in BTC.

But here's where the story gets weirder.

While they were $BTC billionaires on paper, the couple had laundered the money via, among other things, purchasing $500 gift cards from Walmart, Uber, Hotels.com, and Playstation.

They couldn't even access most of the money

On top of that, the couple was relatively well known.

Heather Morgan was a serial entrepreneur and angel investor who had written for both Inc and Forbes magazine on entrepreneurship and social persuasion.

But her side gig? RAZZLEKHAN, amateur rapper

And Ilya Lichtenstein was publicly known as well: a cofounder of MixRank, a Y-Combinator backed startup that helps companies analyze marketing data around customers and competitors.

Today, they were both taken into DOJ custody.

As to the $BTC? Well, hypothetically it'll be given back to Bitfinex, who plan to buy back their exchange token in a long-overdue (but maybe ineffective) way to repay customers.

Their token, LEO, is mooning on the news and has made its way into the top 25 cryptos.

This has big implications for both LEO and BTC, as it represents a huge block of BTC that will come on the market.

With selling methods like TWAP as well as OTC deals, it's likely that it doesn't affect the $BTC market too much, but $4 billion is a decent chunk.

Also, now the federal government has nearly $4 billion in crypto on their balance sheet.

Yeah, it's not technically 'theirs.'

But on the other hand, it kind of is. It also shows us that the DOJ is both closely examining and deploying massive resources to the crypto industry.",cryptocurrency,1644374840.0
personalfinance,How exactly do Series I bonds work?,"I've been seeing discussion in this subreddit about Series I bonds and how they are earning ~7%.

personalfinance,"Is this budget feasible? I’m trying to reach a savings goal, but my car is the only thing I’m iffy about.","I’m 19. I’m saving a lot by going to community college to get my AA, which I plan to do in three years to give myself time to save for when I transfer to university. 

I, for different reasons, have no savings. Now I’m in a position to save, though. I got a job at Starbucks for around 12.50 which will raise to 15/hr in the summer. 

I started this budget not with a savings goal in mind, but to see how much I could save.

I calculated my taxes out from my gross using the smart asset paycheck calculator. I’m in Florida so no state taxes which helps. But I’m not sure if it accounted for unemployment taxes or something… someone mentioned something about that to me and I didn’t know anything about it. But smart asset gave me my take home pay, so I think I’m good. 

Here’s my budget: 120 a month for car insurance. 80 for gas. 15 for phone. 200 for personal. Personal includes my basic needs, shampoo and stuff. Whatever the pell grant doesn’t cover for my classes at community college. Car maintenance. A dress for a special occasion. Work attire requirements. Changing my car’s oil. A cheap flight to visit dying family. A cheap hair cut. Saving for a wheel alignment or brake change. Reasonable shoes for long foot hours. Entertainment (I grew up poor so trust me, the bar is low. Maybe 15 to go to an exhibit. Or 15 to go to a movie. Or 5 for a coffee. Parking and extra gas to go to the beach. Something like these examples I do about once at most twice a month. I don’t subscribe to any services like netflix, amazon or spotify, even at student discounts). Car maintenance fund. 

I figured as long as I set a cap, I can’t possibly spend more than 100$/month for personal use. I do some unconscious spending with my card, so I figured I’d just carry 5 20s with me everywhere so that I can really keep track of it, and at the end of the month, put whatever’s left in my car maintenance fund and contribute to my grandparents. (My car is in good condition but it’s a 2007 at 80k miles. My boyfriends newer car just had a spontaneous engine problem that costed him abt 1000 just to diagnose, and will be costing him more. Car stuff is scary and I don’t want to dip too far in my savings just in case something happens)

So that’s 415 out of my monthly income for expenses and car fund every month. Definitely bearable.

This way, I can pay for university without having to take out out federal loans, much less private. Any scholarships and grants I get will be applied and the difference added to my savings. I’m still planning to work during school, but I’m assuming those will be internships or something, I can’t determine how much I will be paid, but it will still be something, enough to cover my 415/month budget. 

Here are my calculations: 

1 month of full time (40 hrs/week at 15/hr) 1,984
3 months full time 5,952
3 summers *17,856*

1 month part time (20 hrs/week) 1,020
8 months part time (that one month less is accounting for time I may or may not take off, or get less hours) 8,160
2 school years *16,320*

total income (after taxes) 34,176 (17k+16k)

total months 27 (2 school years and 3 summers)

27 months x 415 of negative expenses = 11,205

34,176 - 11,205 = savings 22,971

tuition and book for two full time years at UCF
14,308

22,971 - 14,308 = *8,663*

So by the time I start university I will have 23k in savings, and at the end I will have 8k. This isn’t including the time I work between now and this summer before the plan starts,  and after the end of the plan for the two years I’m working while attending university.

I’m expecting to make at most 11,573 (1 summer vs 3, I’ll have less) in savings during my two years at uni (keeping the same pay and hours as I will for my 2+ year community college plan), and at the least (minimum wage and less than 20 hours during the 2 school years, minimum wage but full time during the 1 summer) 2,159 in savings. 

After I graduate college, I will have an estimated savings range of 10.8k and 20.2k

CryptoCurrency,Could Bitcoin Hit $10 Trillion by 2030?,"Bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, was worth $729 billion as of Jan. 31, but it hasn't been immune to the whims of the broader market. Digital assets have taken a hit in recent months, with Bitcoin falling 44% since early November. The Federal Reserve plans to hike interest rates this year, leading investors to transition away from these higher-risk assets. 

It has certainly attracted its fair share of both skeptics and believers, but can Bitcoin reach a market cap of $10 trillion by 2030? I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility. Let's analyze some scenarios that could make this happen, as well as a big risk factor. 

Over the past five years, Bitcoin has gained 3,800%. If its market value were to hit $10 trillion by 2030, that's roughly a 1,200% return over the next eight to nine years. Compared to Bitcoin's historical performance, this is a sharp slowdown. 

Bitcoin would need to become recognized as a legitimate store of value in the eyes of the investment community in order to reach the $10 trillion mark. Reducing friction for this is a growing suite of financial infrastructure, connecting the traditional financial system to the crypto economy.  

We haven't even touched on the potential for Bitcoin to actually achieve status as a medium of exchange, which would definitely push it to greater heights. Nations can follow El Salvador's path by making it legal tender. Additionally, Bitcoin can penetrate the $700 billion global market for remittances, an expensive and slow financial transaction system of border-crossing transactions that is ripe for disruption. If it can make progress toward these use cases, it's not hard to believe that Bitcoin can hit $10 trillion by 2030. 

If you haven't already, I think it would be smart to allocate 1% of a well-diversified portfolio to this top cryptocurrency.",cryptocurrency,1644390039.0

3. Reports say Solana went down again for several hours on January 4th, 2022. Maybe this is a strategy to normalize the idea of “decentralized blockchains” that can be turned on and off at will.

8. Liqwid Community Call #4 happened on Jan 5, 2022. It sounds like Liqwid is taking a very different approach from Ardana and will not be waiting for any hardforks that might incorporate CIPs like 31, 32, &amp; 33. [https://twitter.com/liqwidfinance/status/1478446489202536448](https://twitter.com/liqwidfinance/status/1478446489202536448)

27. Seabug has dropped a new medium article on their protocol for self-governed NFTs. This may turn out to be somewhat controversial to some since it may be seen as diminishing the unimpinged bearer bond like status of a crypto token issued under the protocol in exchange for theft protection. Many will like that. Some will not. Mlabs is mentioning a late February release for the actual NFT marketplace.

45. Alessandro gives us a big update on exactly what was going on with Nami wallet over the last few days (blockfrost mempools full) and how Blockfrost has gone about fixing it (spun up more nodes…30 now…with more mempools). You can also use Nami with your own node if you want. They are impressively nimble to be able to address this in such a short amount of time.

52. Looks like no SudaeSwap rewards today and no calculator yet (as of writing on Jan. 25). But, there is a calculator coming and the rewards will now be via DripDropz. Discord reports are that the rewards calculator should be in the next day or two. This is probably a big improvement for anyone staking via yoroi. They will also be adding various stats to the pools including queue depth. [https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1486030734267764747](https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1486030734267764747)

58. The U.S. Congress attempts to send us another very bad crypto bill in the America Competes Act.

Trading,Which way is USD/CAD more likely to break this week?,"USD/CAD once again bounced off its 50-day EMA yesterday to trade in the middle of a strong 2-week range, as a dip in oil prices weakened the Canadian Dollar. However, the pair could find some direction over the next few days with BOC Governor Macklem set to speak later today, and US CPI figures out on Thursday.

Inflation data will be the main focus with estimates for 40-year high in January, and hot print would add to the speculation of a 50bps rate hike in March from the Fed. This would likely result in the US Dollar gaining against the loonie as well as oil, helping USD/CAD target a breakout above the range’s resistance around 1.2800. 

However, a hawkish speech from Macklem could provide some solace for the CAD today, which, if followed by a weaker-than-expected CPI print, might see CAD bulls flood the market and look to retest a break below the 50-day EMA. 

All trading carries risk, but with a big move in either direction looking possible at the moment, USD/CAD should be an interesting one to watch.",finance,1644392294.0

* $2000 in dentist bills
* $1000-1200 in hospital bills
* $1700 bank loan
* $3000 in Federal student loans (not as worried about rn)

I have a few other small stuff but these are my main worries. I moved out a few months ago and now pay rent and live paycheck to paycheck without being able to save much.

I can't even hardly afford the payments on the credit card or bank loan, especially when the interest on the credit card is as much as minimum payment.

I've been trying to get a $10k 5-year loan to consolidate at least the CC debt, medial bills, and bank loan (at least $9,100).

In the last six months, my credit has jumped around between 654 and 711. 

Every place I've tried so far for a loan has offered me only $1k or so and nothing more.

I want to get everything together into one payment and so that I won't get charged such ridiculous interest on the CC.

personalfinance,No other debt - should I pay off my car?,"Hi all. I’m at a standstill with my next financial move and I am looking for advice. 

I have 6 months worth of emergency expenses saved up and it is very likely my income increases by ~ $20k in the next month or two. 

Now that I have a large emergency fund, it feels kind of “useless” to keep saving with no goal in mind in the future (waiting for gf to finish college to start our lives and have 2.5 more years of that).

I paid off my student loans in full back in September, which left me with my car loan as my only debt. I pay $240 a month for it and the interest rate is 2.75%. 

Even though I can absolutely afford it, would it be a smart decision to get it paid off earlier. If I were to do this, I would effectively put any extra cash I had and throw it at the car. I could pay off the car, according to my calculations in a little over a year on my current income and a little under a year with the raise. 

Part of me feels like this is wasteful because what if I want to get into a new vehicle soon? I was thinking of upgrading to an SUV for comfort and AWD capability (it snows a lot in Boston). Getting rid of a car payment to just pick one up again sounds dumb to me. 

The other part of me thinks this is literally the best thing I can do with the extra money right now. I’m setting myself up for a great gift in the future when my gf and I are starting our lives and I won’t have to worry about a car payment.

personalfinance,Using cost of living calculators for basis in salary negotiations.,"I have completed a few rounds of interviews for a position at a company located in a west coast city that, according to Nerd Wallet, has a 60% higher cost of living than the Midwest city I currently live in. This position would require relocating to this west coast city. 

In 2021, I had a gross income of $101k of which I spent $48k and the rest went to retirement savings and taxes. If my spending habits stay the same in this west coast city, according to Nerd Wallet I can expect to spend $76,800 in 2022 ($48k\*1.6). 

In order to put the same $ amount in retirement savings in 2022, I would require a gross income increase of $41,143 \[($76,800-$48,000)/(1-0.3)\], where I assume a 30% income tax rate (24% fed + state, SS, medicare, etc.)

This means that if I want to avoid sacrificing my retirement savings, I would require a minimum gross salary of \~$142k in this new city. Is this sound logic?

I also know that is it common to expect a 10-15% pay increase when moving to a new company. A 15% pay increase then puts me at a gross salary of \~$163,500. Going from $101k to $163k seems like a unreasonable expectation. I'm interested to hear your thoughts on my logic and expectations.

EDIT: I would not use this information as a negotiation tactic. I am simply trying to determine what salary I require for it to be financially beneficial for me to accept a job in this city.",finance,1644408444.0

I just made an offer and unfortunately was rejected (I was the #2 option) but in the process began discussing other loan options with my mortgage lender.

They suggested a non-QM loan might be a better fit because the interest rates on the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac loans were pretty high, especially at the price point I'm looking for (\~$850k with 20% down). From what I've been reading, though, it looks like non-QM loans are geared more towards people who wouldn't qualify for a more traditional loan - which isn't the case for me.

I would appreciate folks' thoughts on whether a non-QM loan is a good option or not for someone who should qualify for a traditional loan. Are the interest rates just more competitive at the moment?

Thank you!

Update: Thank you for the responses! It sounds like I should speak to my lender more about why they're offering a non-QM loan and not something else. I'll also do a little more research into the different types of mortgages - maybe I'm just missing something.",finance,1644411190.0

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC on Wednesday that three rate hikes are possible this year but that the central bank is not locked in to any path and will watch how the economy responds.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Peloton continued its rebound, rising more than 4% premarket the day after the company announced a restructuring plan that will include layoffs and the removal of its CEO. Despite a bumpy road, shares of the interactive fitness company are now positive year to date after soaring more than 25% in Tuesday trading.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 370 points, helped by a 7.8% pop in Amgen on the back of its strong earnings report. The S&amp;P 500 also registered a gain, climbing 0.8%. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3%.
*****
&gt; A handful of strong corporate earnings boosted sentiment on Tuesday, after a slow start to the week. Harley-Davidson, Chegg, DuPont and Centene all rose after reporting better-than-expected earnings.
*****
&gt; As of the closing bell on Tuesday, nearly 60% of all S&amp;P 500 companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings and roughly 77% have topped Wall Street’s earnings estimates, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; “We are wrapping up a very solid earnings season,” said Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial. “Sure, we had a high-profile blowup at Facebook, but overall we’ve seen impressive news from corporate America.”
*****
&gt; Disney, Mattel, MGM Resorts and Uber Technologies will release results after the bell on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors are also preparing for Thursday’s Consumer Price Index report, which will give an update on the inflation picture. The Fed has already signaled a monetary policy pivot in order to address the historically high price increases.
*****
&gt; The CPI report “has had a big bullseye on it all week and the truth is that headline number will likely be one of the highest we’ve ever seen,” Detrick said. “Now the good news is we are likely close to a major peak in inflation and this number very well could be the peak. We’ve seen some improvements in supply chains lately and this is the first clue we are nearing a peak in inflation as well.”
*****
&gt; The inflation data is estimated to show that prices rose 0.4% in January, for a 7.2% gain from one year ago, according to Dow Jones.

personalfinance,Reporting Scholarships,"Hi all,

I've got a question about reporting scholarships. Right now on my 1098-T for my academic institution I've got a outside scholarship amount for $X. 

Half of that amount was distributed at the beginning of Fall 2021 to cover tuition based fees and some of it was deposited for me to use for room and board. The other half was used to cover tuition fees for Spring 2022, although my academic institution received and processed the scholarship on 12/21/2021. I did not receive a refund for this portion until January 2022. 

Do I need to report the full amount of the scholarship ($X) on my tax form or only the portion that was intended to be used for 2021? Do things change if I am expected to volunteer in condition of receiving the scholarship? Right now I owe federal taxes and I believe that this scholarship is a huge reason for that.

personalfinance,"When people say, ""Interest rates are so low it doesn't make sense to pay cash"" on a car where are they actually putting their money and how do they get it back?","I've got equity in my car because the market is nuts right?  I've also got enough saved up specifically for a down payment that depending on circumstances I might only have to borrow between $5000-$8000 for the car.  However, i've also got other savings and depending on how long it takes for the car to be built (i would be able to save more) I could swing just paying cash and never having a car payment.

However, then some people say things like ""oh, interest rates are (or were) so low it just doesn't make sense to spend the cash, I'd rather ""invest it"" and get better return"".

Where are they putting that money?  I hate car payments.  I'd rather spend the cash and start immediately rebuilding my savings or just ""investing"" that monthly payment.  If I invest money and make money on it don't I pay huge taxes on those gains?  Assume I had a choice between an $8000 loan at 2.5% that I plan to pay off in 3 years or spending $8,000 in cash now.  How does it make more sense to pay interest on a 2.5% loan than to just spend the cash and get that $280ish/month being put back into savings or some kind of investment?  I could pay cash and then instead of loan payment put that same money ""somewhere"" where it could also make me money?  That way when my wife's care is ready to be replaced I've got a larger cash amount to purchase it with?

We've been saving up for a new house and we're estimating it will take between 12-18 months to get 20% down on what we want to upgrade to.  We want to make this as low-stress as possible.  

The game plan we came up with is to sit and wait until we have at least 20%.  Then we'll buy a new house, move into it, then sell the old house.  That way we don't have to worry about living in the house while it's being shown to potential buyers.

personalfinance,Using empty credit account to pay off larger/lower interest account snowball debt - Good use for credit score impact?,"I have a visa card I keep at $0 with a $4,500 limit, and a line of credit with a 25k limit that is close to maxed out (23-24\~ after a house purchase/big move, we are now winding down and getting back to a place where we can just live within our income means and make debt payments). We paid off the Visa a while ago and switched to using just the line of credit for all our credit needs as the interest rate difference between the 2 is massive (Visa is something like 21% and line of credit is like... prime + 3%?) We are now snowballing the line of credit debt and have the ability to make large payments off it every month (400-500ish regularly, more when our dual-income situation changes). I know I'm 'supposed to' use my Visa card every month X amount (not sure what's ideal) and simply pay it back to $0 every month as well to make a positive impact on my credit score (or if not, please clarify). I recently Googled and found that transfers between credit cards don't make an impact on credit score. I know the close to max credit account is a negative.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Would it be a good idea in this case to transfer the amount we are going to pay off the line of credit anyway each month/cycle to Visa first and THEN pay it off completely from there? So for example, we'd transfer $500 away from the line of credit to count as a $500 payment, to the Visa as a $500 purchase, then pay the Visa off back to $0. Since we are not using the Visa anyway (we want to, just for a positive impact on credit score), would this be a good use for it/would this work in the way I'm thinking?

CryptoCurrency,Are Most Initial Coin Offerings Done Illegally?,"I have been doing a lot of research on US security laws because I am looking to start a cryptocurrency project with an initial coin offering and a real world asset that backs the coin and creates ROI for investors. Both of these aspects of the project made me think initially that what I'm doing might implicate the securities registration requirements of the SEC. Though I was mostly concerned with the real world asset piece.

I started by meeting with a lawyer who has a cryptocurrency background to see if the real world asset aspect of the project would make it a security. Unfortunately, he had the strong opinion that the project would be considered a security, but not just because real world assets are involved. It also will most likely be considered a security simply because of the initial coin offering. In fact, he said that most cryptocurrency projects that have initial coin offerings aren't registered as a security and should be.

This threw me off quite a bit initially, and I was thinking there's no way most cryptocurrency projects are non-compliant with security laws. But I did more research on my own, and I'm really starting to agree with his viewpoint. I've found articles such as [this one on the SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-12-11) site that really seem to back up this lawyer's claim. A quote from this statement, written by an SEC chairman, says: ""By and large, the structures of initial coin offerings that I have seen promoted involve the offer and sale of securities and directly implicate the securities registration requirements and other investor protection provisions of our federal securities laws."" It's definitely worth reading the entire paragraph this quote is from if not the entire statement.

So my question is, is it really true that most initial coin offerings are done illegally because they aren't registered as a security when they should be? And from my research it's very expensive to register as a security. Won't this prevent many projects from starting because in order to even raise funds in an initial coin offering to afford registering as a security they would need to register first?

cybersecurity,"What is Shadow Liability - Where does it lurk, and how much does it contribute to 3rd Party Risk","Shadow Liability is defined as Risk that a company absorbs as a result of using 3rd party software, services or APIs. This is an especially tricky bit of liability to quantify accurately. Most organizations use a combination of vendor 

(1) network and infrastructure vulnerability reports (ala Tenable type scans) 

(2) security scorecard/bitsight type external opinion scores

(3) independent pen testing reports

(4) cyber-insurance policy coverage

(5) SOC2 type process oriented or more detailed FedRAMP style compliance reports

However a chasm remains in terms of understanding and verbalizing what exact risks is an organization absorbing into its operations by lieu of using a 3rd party vendor's software or service. None of the above accurately account for how to define and quantify the problem. It's not to say what is presented above is not useful, it is. 

Consider a case where a vendor provides a software service, as an example, managed Kafka pipelines or Zabbix installations. How do we quantify what risk is being levied upon the buyer. We need to understand how the product is being used - public facing, touches PII, production critical, access to keys etc. Then the other side of the coin, what is the product composed of - Software Composition Analysis (SCA). This latter one is a tricky beast - not many vendors will provide an SCA analysis report on their software. The best one might get is documentation that the vendor's SDLC follows best practices - but rarely anything more.

The image attached to this post makes a first attempt to highlight where the issues are, how much do they contribute to liabilities for these types of use cases.

She is employed, but makes far less than I do (I make $190k per year, she makes about $30k). It was suggested to us by friends that we file our taxes as Married, Filing Separately this year because the student loan payments will begin in a few months (typically six months after graduation) and it would be based on her income *alone* if we filed separately, versus basing the payments on our combined income if we file jointly. This is largely based off the payment plan we choose, such as Income Based, but we have confirmed that her loans are eligible for Income Based when filing Separately.

Is it a good idea to file separately for the sake of minimizing student loan payments? I imagine this is very based on our income and location. Is there perhaps a calculator or formula I can use to find out if this is advantageous?

Another factor, though hypothetical, is that federal student loan payments and interest have been frozen since the pandemic and it may be a long time before they start up again (technically May of this year, but they've been pushing it back every few months for 2 years).",finance,1644427080.0
CryptoCurrency,"Earn interest on crypto and stablecoins: begginer to advanced guide, DeFi, LP, staking, lending","Generating yield on crypto is a booming thing. There are many ways to boost your gains, this includes lending, staking, liquidity providing, etc. You can do this with CeFi and DeFi. This is an updated attempt to provide guide for begginers, but even experieneced user might find some useful tips.

  
**First let get some terms right:**  
*Staking* \- refers to generating income by block generation on Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. The term is heavily misused everywhere, so nowadays it can mean anything from staking to liquidity providing

*Lending* \- you lend your crypto and get interest. Counterparty does anything it want with it and hopefully pays back some day.

*Liquidity providing (LP)* \- you provide two (sometimes even more) cryptocurrencies to a DEX (decentralized exchange), so people can trade. You get your share of trading fees.

*CeFi* \- centralized companies, you can lend them your coins, they pay you interest.

*DeFi* \- decentralized (well, at least in theory) applications like DEXes, lending apps etc

  
**Risks**

There are obviously risks that come with all this, so beware. CeFi can get hacked, can scam you, can bankrupt. DeFi can get hacked, can scam you and its happening a lot. With staking you can get slashed (happens rarely), but if you delegate your funds to a validator, he can misbehave (depends on specific chain what he can or cant do). When doing LP, you face impermanent loss, in addition to all the DeFi risks.

  
**How to get yield**

Now lets get to generating some money, starting from the simplest options.

# CeFi

Probably easiest thing to do is to lend your coins to a big CeFi lender, like Celsius. They have been around for a while, have $20B in assets under management and among CeFi its as safe as it gets. But their rates are somewhat lower than what competitors can pay you. Rates for different coins are a lot different and every CeFi lender has different rates for the coin, so you can optimize by using several CeFi. When deciding between platforms these are important things to consider: rates, security, jurisdiction, withdrawal fees, how customer support works. Also not every lender will be available in your country.  
Where to find best rates:

* [https://coinlenders.net](https://coinlenders.net/) \- this a is site i put together myself, you can search for rates among several CeFi and DeFi lending platforms. Just select a coin and see what your options are.

Note that most of the CeFi platforms have tiered system, meaning you can get best rate on limited amount - if that affects you, consider splitting funds between multiple platforms to get best value. It also helps with diversification.  
StakingIf you have Proof of Stake coins, than very likely staking will be safest option with great return. Many CeFi providers will just stake the coin for you and take their cut for doing this, so consider doing it yourself.

Typical yield for stablecoins is 10-12%, 5-6% on bitcoin and ether.

There are services that promise a way bigger yield than this, but i don't find them trustworthy enough for sharing. But just in case you want to gamble, know that if you look, you can find yields like 15-30% on btc - but dont be suprised if you end up with nothing...

# DeFi

Moving to DeFi. First of all try to eliminate unnecessary risks by obtaining HW wallet. Ledger or Trezor. Chose wisely according to the chains you wanna use, not all chains are supported. If possible, go for the Nano X or Model T, as these support all the modern stuff. Learn to use Metamask with you HW wallet, it will work well for all the EVM chains.

# DeFi lending

Just like CeFi, you can just lend you coin with some lending protocol like AAVE, Compound etc. Most of the DeFi protocols issue its own token, and sometimes they will give some as incentives to lenders, borrowers or liquidity providers. This is additional yield, sometimes these rewards are locked for some time, so there is a risk of the incentive token losing lot of value before you can sell. Interest rates are usually adjusted to current market situation and change a lot, so you need to monitor it.

* [https://coindix.com/?kind=single](https://coindix.com/?kind=single)

# DeFi - liquidity providing

Liquidity providing is another great way to generate yield. You provide some liquidity to a DEX, in return you get fees and sometimes also incentive tokens. Usually you need to provide two assets in 50:50 ratio, which makes it more complicated. Understand, that by providing liquidity you are basically putting you assets for sale and you no longer have direct exposure to their price, so if the price in the pair changes, you will find that you own different amount of tokens and always, you will own more of the worse one.  
This is called impermanent loss, but there is nothing really impermanent about it, its quite normal loss. To avoid impermanent loss you can chose a pool with currencies of equal or correlated value, like USDC-USDT. Also note that due to the impermanent loss, if one token loses 100% of value, you lose everything in the pool not just half - because you will be left with with 100% of the worthless one, due to arbitrage. Sometimes with the LP pools you will see ridiculous APYs like 1000000%, that does not mean you are getting rich. The reason for these crazy APYs is usually one of these:

* its a new platform and it will go down quickly as more liquidity is added
* You need to but hyperinflating token which will lose a lot of value over time, negating the gains
* Its very unsecure/untrustworthy platform with high risk of getting robbed

Where to find the best pools? Here are some resources to help:

**How to handle incentive tokens/rewards**  
You usually will want to sell it and add to your lending/LP positions to get compounding effects. These incentive tokens are normally very inflationary and are losing value quickly, especially when the protocol is new. Claiming the rewards and swapping it on DEX are transactions which can cost you tx fees, so if this is on expensive chain like Ethereum, this is only profitable for whales basically. Solution is to use automatic compounders, like Autofarm, more on this later. When the reward is locked for some time, it may go down a lot during this period, and your yield will be smaller than expected. Be sure to include this in your risk assessment.

# Advanced strategies

When you get familiar with DeFi, you might want to try some advanced stuff, combining multiple protocols together to boost your yields even further. These come with more risk and usually involve some kind of leverage, so be careful. There are plenty of options, lets check some usual or popular options.Some of these strategies:  


**Recursive lending**

This is when you lend your asset to a DeFi protocol and borrow it right back, then supply it into the same protocol. You can do the loop several time until limit is reached, the limit is a function of collateral factor. So lets say you deposit $1k and collateral factor is 80%, you can max you position to 1/(1-CF), so to $5k deposit and $4k borrow position. There will be a lot of transactions doing this, so you need cheap chain or big deposit to be worthy. This strategy is profitable if deposit interest is bigger than borrow interest, which is possible when incentive token rewards are high. But you will need to do constant compounding to avoid liquidation (without it your debt grows). You need to monitor the incentive token price and the APYs, so you can recognize when its no longer profitable.

* [https://www.tranquil.finance/](https://www.tranquil.finance/) is one place this is possible at this moment

&amp;#x200B;

**Lend and borrow, then put into LP**

Some protocols do not allow recursive lending, you can maybe circumvent this with multiple accounts, or you can do something else, like deposit USDT, borrow USDC, sell half of the USDC for USDT and put it in LP pool. Again, you need high incentive token rewards to make it profitable.

  
**Automated compounding**

As compounding on some platforms is costly due to blockchain fees, solution is to use automated compounder, like Autofarm, which does all the work for you in optimal way. You add some risk by doing this, if the auto compounding protocol gets compromised, you also lose your deposit.Examples:

* Autofarm: [https://autofarm.network/](https://autofarm.network/)
* Beefy: [https://beefy.finance/](https://beefy.finance/)

**Leveraged yield farming**

Basically you provide liquidity, while borrowing additional money to get more yield. You pay interest to lenders, but you earn more of the incentive tokens and fees. You put your money as collateral. Examples: 

* Alpaca: [https://app.alpacafinance.org/farm](https://app.alpacafinance.org/farm)
* Tulip: [https://tulip.garden/leverage](https://tulip.garden/leverage)

**Anchor+Mirror**

Anchor protocol is one of the most favorite places to earn interest on stablecoins, with stable 19.5% its a no brainer. But you can get more when combining with Mirror protocol. This is covered in depth in many articles, so i am not going to repeat it: just google Anchor Mirror delta neutral strategy.

* [https://www.anchorprotocol.com/](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/)
* [https://mirrorprotocol.app](https://mirrorprotocol.app)

**Anchor+MIM leverage**

Another thing people have been doing is basically leveraging your position. You borrow MIM against your aUST tokens (representing your deposit), sell MIM for UST, deposit again. I have never done this though, 

* [https://www.anchorprotocol.com/](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/)

**Nexus**

Next generation of these combined strategies is automated. Nexus Protocol is a great example: you deposit LUNA or ETH(PoS version) to nexus, it uses it as collateral in Anchor to borrow UST, deposits the UST to Anchor for additional yield, it monitors and maintains your LTV to ensure you are not liquidated, sell you profits for LUNA/ETH and it results in safer and higher yield.

# Moving funds between chains

If you are going the DeFi way, you may need to move funds between chains a lot. Especially valid for stablecoins and WBTC. Some tips to do this effectively:

* Register on exchanges which support withdrawals and depostits to multiple chains: Binance, Bitfinex, Crypto. com - you can deposit with one chain, withdraw with other, usually paying some withdrawal fees
* For swapping one stablecoin for another, use Binance rather than DEX, as fees are way lower. (if low cost is a priority, understandably for some of you priorites might be different, or you dont have binance available etc.)
* Learn how to use multichain router: [https://app.multichain.org/#/router](https://app.multichain.org/#/router) for cheap cross chain transfers
* For larger amounts, avoid services which charge percentual fees
* Swapping to one crypto and than back for cross chain transafers is sometimes possible, but usually not very cheap and might trigger taxable event. Sometimes it might be only option though.
* Ethereum bridges are usually the most expensive way to do this, unless you are handling very large amounts

**Some additional tips:**

* If you just starting with few hundreds dollars, don't bother with DeFi. You will get crushed by blockchain fees. Use some CeFi lender with free withdrawals to accumulate, when you have more, you can start with DeFi. Also these CeFis will often give you nice sign-up bonuses, which will probably be worth a lot more than the interest, so be sure to get it. You can even jump between several CeFis to collect more of it. If still want to do DeFi, use a cheap chain. Harmony and Solana come to mind. Avoid Ethereum.
* Don't get attached to a specific chain, good opportunities appear on different chains every time, it does not make sense to limit yourself to one favorite. Of course, if you are hodling SOL token, you will probably find best opportunities on Solana network, but with universal assets like stablecoins or BTC, it can be anywhere.
* Always monitor your gains. If something doesn't add up, investigate and be prepared to move your funds.
* Depending on your jurisdiction, you might have to pay taxes on your lending/staking/LP gains. 

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite CeFi products:

* Hodlnaut.com
* Ledn.io
* Celsius
* FTX
* Less known, but very promising: Vauld

My favorite DeFi products:

* Anchor Protocol - note that Anchor Yield reserve is bleeding rapidly, its possible that yield will go down. 
* Tranquil.finance on Harmony (+Mimas clone from the same team on Cronos)
* TraderJoe on Avalanche
* Sovryn on RSK

I am a US resident on an H1B. After many years of searching, I finally thought I found a place I could purchase and call my own.

Anyways, 2 weeks ago I signed a loan document locking my interest rate at 3.3%. Now they called me and suddenly stated that the rate was only available for US Citizens.

In my original application, I made sure to disclose the fact that I'm a non permanent resident, non citizen. I thought they understood that, but it seems like THEY made the mistake and now THEY want me to pay for this. I have all documents to prove this.

They want to raise my rate based on today to 3.7%, or I pay additional money to lock in a lower interest rate to 3.5% (\~6000 USD)

What are my options? I think it's pretty unreasonable for me to pay anything based on today's rate (interest rates already jumped since 2 weeks ago!). I am going to try to reason with them to see if I can get a better rate, seeing that this is THEIR mistake.

I'm tired of getting shafted, I thought I was lucky to get a small starter home in this crazy market, but still there HAS to be some other problem.

stocks,She said it...Fed’s Mester doesn’t see ‘compelling case’ for half percentage point rate hike in March,"The Federal Reserve doesn’t have to start hiking its policy interest rate with a big 50 basis point move, said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester on Wednesday. In a virtual address to the European Economics and Financial Center in London, Mester made clear that she supports rate hikes this year, beginning in at the next meeting on March 16, given the high inflation readings and strong labor market.

“The task before us is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control,” Mester said.

Some on Wall Street have raised the possibility that the Fed would raise rates in March by 50 basis points, but Mester said she didn’t see a “compelling case” for such a large move. “We’ve got to be a little careful. Because…even though you can well telegraph sort of what’s coming, when you take the that first action, you know there’s going to be a reaction,” she said.

Looking at the terminal rate — where the Fed’s policy rate rise will be the last one in the rate hiking cycle — Mester said that with the economy doing so strongly, the Fed might have to raise rates above neutral – which is estimated at a 2.5% policy rate.

Moving above 2.5% would mean that policy is aiming to restrict economic growth. This is not the “soft landing” scenario for the economy envisioned by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at his press conference after the last Fed meeting in January.

I have an LOC, the interest rate is 6.94% annual. Currency = $CAD

The question is not, ""should I use a portion of the LOC to stake DOT @ 12%APY (Kraken),"" but where are the blind spots? As far as I can tell the math works: 

1) $5000 on the LOC generates an interest only monthly payment of $28.92CAD.

2) Rough DOT/CAD price snapshot: $28CAD/DOT.

3) Currently staking 50 DOT + 178.57 DOT ($5000 / $28)  = 228.57 DOT staked

4)  29.1 DOT staking reward over 12 months @ $28CAD/DOT =  $67.9CAD/month if DOT stays at the same price. It would have to drop more than half for the monthly reward to not cover the interest only on the LOC. 

Things to consider would be withdrawal fees and taxes on realized gains to really hone in the net monthly income from staking. Another consideration would be interest rates, and the sentiment generated from the talks of them going up and the actual implemented rise, whatever/whenever that may be.  Is there anything I'm missing in this theoretical consideration?

Further we strongly suggest consulting a professional tax advisor to determine if taxes should be reported for your applicable state."" 

I live in Pennsylvania and I'm not sure if taxes need to be reported in my state. In a brief tax consult I had today the accountant seemed to think I do need to report it. However, that would mean that I need to pay roughly $7,000 in state and local taxes for this loan repayment program. I reached out to HRSA and they hit me with "" When making your decision regarding payment of state taxes, please consider the STAR LRP contract (Section B: Obligations of the Applicant, 1.

This would mean that I would need to pay $119,633.91 to FED Loans (my lender) and shovel out $7,000 of my own money for state and local taxes. HRSA is unwilling to provide any information. I don't know what to do. What are my options?! HELP!!!",finance,1644439810.0

personalfinance,Does it make sense for me to buy a house given my current financial situation?,"I need some of that good 'ole confirmation bias. 

I've been actively looking for a starter home/townhome in my area, but I'm too hesitant to pull the trigger given the volatility in the market right now. I live in Minnesota. 

Also, I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on the relation between raising interest rates and home prices.

I've been looking into the $17,500 Bank of America grant for first-time homebuyers. It sounds like it'd be a great fit for my situation and help with closing costs and the downpayment. 

**Financials:** 

Funds- Currently, I have \~$20,000 in savings but my time horizon is flexible, so I understand if I need to build on this. 

Price- Looking around the $225,000 price range, but any further insight on how much I could reasonably afford is much appreciated. What's the general consensus on how much you should spend? Should I focus more on a single family home or settle for a townhome? Is it just preference? 

Credit- \~750

Debts- $336 monthly car payment. No student loans or other debt. 

Income- $57,000 yearly. $4,769 monthly gross. $3,662 monthly take home pay.

The alternative to purchasing a home right now would be to keep living at home, accumulate money for a larger downpayment, hope for a raise, and then buy a house in the future when I'm more financially prepared. What should I do? Thanks in advance!

Warmly,

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

personalfinance,Student Loans vs Renting vs Buying Condo,"I am a 29 year old who completed my Doctorate in 2020 and became a licensed physical therapist. I am also pursuing an online part time MBA which has put my student loans ($189,000) in deferment until I graduate May 2023. This past year, I have made $68,000 working part time and I have a total savings of $55,000. 

Currently, I am living at my parent's house with my girlfriend who is also in school pursuing her Master's Degree. However, things have become more tense with different lifestyles and personalities. The plan was to stay another year to save more but the tensions between us and my parents have gotten to the point where it is also stressing my personal relationships with everyone in the house. 

We are looking to rent in Massachusetts and rent is almost the same amount ($1800/month + utilities) as buying a condo apartment/townhouse. Because of that, I thought it would be a good idea to look at buying a small townhouse near my work and my girlfriend's school while also building up equity/potentially turning it into a rental in the future. I did the math and I would be able to do it with my income for a small townhouse. However, when I went to a lender for preapproval, they will not accept a $0 monthly payment. Instead, they will calculate based off 1% which would severely reduce my buying power. 

To me, it looks like the only option to buy a home would be to jump back on repaying my loans at the income driven repayment amount which is around $400/month. I plan on doing this regardless because the standard repayment plan would be $2000 a month which would severely impact my finances. Going back to IDR would lead to me living paycheck to paycheck which I also know is a terrible idea. This also does not guarantee that I would be able to find a condo/townhouse around my price point of $300-350k. I also have a $7500 car loan at 2% interest rate that I would need to pay off before approval for a mortgage.

I also did a couple calculations:

Option 1: Rent and stay on deferment for the next year I would save maybe another $14k

Option 2: Go back on IDR and buy a home around $300-325k and I would have a total savings of $7k after only saving up $3k within the year. 

Please let me know what you guys think as this has been a very stressful couple of weeks trying to find a viable solution that doesn't screw me up financially in the long run. I also don’t want to miss out on the possibility of the lowest interest rates for mortgages. I got a quick quote last week from a lender and she said the program had an interest rate between 2.625-2.75%.

I originally believed my tax contribution would have to be a total of $15200, but if I had filed on time each quarter it would have been $14600, as I forgot about half of fica being tax deductible. I also have other deductions I could add, but i didn’t want to over complicate the situation. This will likely be a very expensive lesson, but I can pay the money fortunately due to extra savings.

Even with the doubled face value in 20 years on EE bonds, the interest rate would only be about 3% which is no where close to 7.12%. Am I misunderstanding something here?

Edit:

Thank you for everyone's reply. After reading through the comments does that mean if I assume the semiannual inflation rate stays above 3.496% for the next 20 years, the i bonds will be better than EE bonds in both long and short term?

Using what I learned in class I came up with the following amount functions:

amount function for EE bonds -

a(t) = (1+ fixed rate/2)\^(2t)

amount function for I bonds (assuming the composite rate doesnt change)-

a(t) = (1+ composite rate/2)\^(2t)

* $1,673: Our ESPP gives us a 15% discount and I can contribute up to 15% of my salary to the program. This accounts for a lot of ""space"" in our budget, but it's non-liquid, so it's hard to figure out how to categorize it.
* $1,250: vacation/wedding fund. We'd like to take 1-2 vacations per year.

Debt Obligations (&lt;$2,000/month):

* $800-1,000: Student loan balance is $100k. Currently refinancing the high interest ones, so the average interest rate will be around 4% and monthly payment around $800/month. We'd like to pay another $200/month on top of that.

stocks,"“A PURE SIDESHOW”: NOW MORE THAN EVER, THE STOCK MARKET DOESN’T MATTER","Whether stocks plunge, which they might, or go back up or just head sideways, it’s irrelevant for almost all of us.

Jon Schwarz


February 9 2022, 11:30 a.m.

THE STOCK PRICE of Meta (i.e., Facebook) plunged 27 percent in one day last week! The S&amp;P 500 is veering into correction territory! The ballyhooed ARK Innovation ETF, made up of dozens of tech stocks, has plummeted 50 percent in the last year!
You’re supposed to feel anxious about this, even if you don’t know what those words mean. The U.S. media constantly screeches at us about the stock market: It’s up, it’s down, it’s sideways, it’s sprouted bright rainbow-colored plumage. Whatever happened in the stock market on any given day often leads the evening news. There’s a stock ticker running constantly at the bottom of the screen on many cable news shows. Times Square has a ticker that movies use for New York City establishing shots almost as often as the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building. And obviously the stock market going up is portrayed as an unmitigated good, while declines are disastrous.
This means there are probably more ominous headlines coming, because even after its recent fall, the stock market remains significantly overvalued.

THE MOST COMMON way to measure whether stocks are undervalued or overvalued is their price-to-earnings, or P/E, ratio. Price is the dollar cost per share, and earnings are the company’s net proceeds per share.
There are slightly different ways of figuring P/E, and many different stock indices. But one widely used P/E ratio calculation for the S&amp;P 500 shows it’s currently about 25. This means that for every $100 in price for the stocks on the index, the companies are accruing $4 in earnings. But the median historical P/E ratio for the S&amp;P is far lower, about 15. In other words, if earnings levels stay the same, the S&amp;P would have to fall 40 percent from where it is now to be priced normally.
The cost of famous individual stocks appears even more out of whack. As of today, Microsoft’s P/E ratio is about 32. Amazon’s is 49. Tesla’s is an eye-bulging 186.
After the stock market bubble of the late 1990s or the housing bubble of the 2000s — or for that matter, the Dutch tulip bubble of the 1600s — you’d think we’d have learned our lesson about financial bubbles. They feel great on the way up, and with stock market bubbles in particular, people have some vague sense that this means good things about the overall economy in the future. But bubbles do not represent real wealth, and the high never lasts.

In theory, stock prices represent the future value of after-tax corporate profit. That’s all. And the higher corporate profits move, the less money there is to pay wages. So higher stock prices can represent a greater level of corporate power and less for workers trying to exact better pay from their employers. Likewise, as Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economics and Policy Research, points out, “If we cut corporate taxes, and offset the cut with an increase in taxes on ordinary workers, that should make the stock market go up, but there is no reason to think this move would lead to more rapid economic growth.” (I briefly worked for Baker long ago.)

Profits and hence stock prices are, as much as anything else, a measure of the balance of power in society.

In other words, profits and hence stock prices are, as much as anything else, a measure of the balance of power in society. The famed 18th-century economist Adam Smith — so popular on the right that White House staffers in the Reagan administration wore ties with pictures of him — explicitly explained this in his book “The Wealth of Nations”: “The rate of profit does not, like rent and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension of society. On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor countries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin.”
So unless you’re C-suite executive with tons of stock (or are nearing retirement age and have made extremely risky decisions with your savings), a stock market plunge generally won’t be bad for you. And it also probably wouldn’t be good for you. “If you don’t have much wealth,” says Josh Bivens, director of research at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, the stock market is “a pure sideshow for your own economic circumstance.”
According to the Federal Reserve’s most recent survey, Americans in the bottom 90 percent of net worth own just 16 percent of stocks overall. Strikingly, the bottom 50 percent own just 1 percent.
Meanwhile, the top 10 percent have 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households alone have 38 percent of stocks.
Given these numbers, stock ownership by race is about what you’d expect. African Americans make up 14 percent of households but have just 3 percent of stock wealth.
Some older members of the upper-middle class are often upset by anyone saying the stock market doesn’t matter, because they’re counting on selling their own stock holdings to finance their retirement. But this is exactly why all financial advisers recommend that everyone but the ultra-rich gradually reduce any stock holdings as they age, replacing the stocks with bonds that may have lower returns but won’t lose value in a stock crash. The long run-up in stock prices over the past several decades has made many people believe they can get the higher possible returns in the stock market without real downside risk. But they can’t.

While few people care about it, there’s also the moral quandary of retiring by selling stocks when they’re overpriced. Perhaps you can successfully offload such stocks to younger people before prices fall. But this would essentially entail scamming all your buyers.
But what about younger members of the upper-middle class, who probably are heavily invested in the stock market? A stock plunge would make them feel poorer for a while, but in the long run they’d be better off with a cheaper market. Regular contributions they’re making into a 401(k) plan, for instance, will buy more stock for the same amount of money. This is exactly analogous to home prices. Overpriced homes are good for older people who already own a house, as long as they can sell before prices fall — but terrible for young people who don’t own a home and would benefit from lower prices.

Overpriced homes are good for older people who already own a house, as long as they can sell before prices fall — but terrible for young people who don’t own a home and would benefit from lower prices.
THERE’S A MORE complicated aspect of the stock market, one understood by almost no one in the U.S.
For a society to thrive and improve, businesses need to continually spend money on investments: new factories, new equipment, research and development, etc.
Most Americans have an inchoate, general sense that higher stock prices make companies more willing and able to make such investments. But in fact, stock prices have little or no relationship to corporate investments, either in theory or reality.
The key fact here is that corporations don’t own their stock; hence an increase in their stock price doesn’t make the company itself richer, just its stockholders. Corporations can raise money to get going via an initial public offering, and that has been important for some technology companies. But that’s generally it.
You might imagine that companies raise money from time to time by issuing new stock. The truth, however, is exactly the opposite. According to the Federal Reserve, corporations have bought and retired an incredible $6.8 trillion more of their stock over the past 25 years than they have issued new stock. The companies generally do this to please their stockholders (including their own executives), since it raises the price of the remaining stock. But it means the stock market has been a gigantic drain on corporate treasuries, rather than filling them.
Where, then, do companies get the cash for investments? The answer’s simple: from the money they make selling their products (with a bit added from borrowing).

The empirical reality of this can be seen in two graphs created by Doug Henwood, the host of KPFA’s “Behind the News” and author of “Wall Street: How It Works and for Whom.”
First, we can see how closely increases in internal corporate funds mirror corporate capital expenditures. When companies have more money, they spend more on investments to increase productivity.

Next  there’s the change in the value of the stock market versus the level of corporate investment. As Henwood puts it, “When the great bull market began in 1982, which we could call the onset of the neoliberal era, the market value of the stock of nonfinancial corporations was 35 percent of GDP and their capital expenditures (capex) were 10 percent of GDP. Almost 40 years later, in 2021, the market value of stock was 167 percent of GDP and capex, 10 percent.” Notably, corporate investments were highest as a share of the economy in the late 1970s and early ’80s, when the stock market’s value was far, far lower as a percentage of the overall economy.

personalfinance,"Tuition benefit considered taxable income when transferred to domestic partners, but not for married couples. We're married now, so can I get back the taxes I already paid?","**TL;DR**\--**Staff tuition benefits are considered ""taxable income"" when transferred to a domestic partner, but not when transferred to a spouse. Can I get back the income taxes I already paid on the tuition benefit (valued at $2,280) I transferred to my domestic partner now that we're married?**

I started a job at a university this past fall. The school offers a tuition benefit for faculty and staff, wherein we get 70% off tuition (doesn’t cover fees). This benefit can be transferred to a dependent child/spouse tax free OR to a domestic partner but the value of the benefit would be considered income and would be taxed accordingly (state and federal income taxes + social security withholdings). 

I transferred my tuition benefit to my partner for the fall term. At the time, we were domestic partners, so I filled out the “domestic partner tuition benefit transfer” form at work. I reviewed my paystubs, and they added the value of the tuition benefit ($2,280) to my applicable gross income over the course of several months and withheld taxes on it. 

Here’s the kicker—my partner and I got married in December 2021. 

I know in the federal government’s eyes, if you get married even on the last day of a year, then you’re considered married for the entire year for tax purposes. Is that the same case for taxes paid on the tuition benefit we received during fall term when we were domestic partners? i.e., will the taxes I paid on the fall tuition benefit we received before getting married be refunded since we got married in 2021? 

My W-2 includes ""Tuitio 2280.00"" in box 14, and the box 1 (wages tips, other compensation) also includes the tuition benefit as part of my income.

I reached out to the university about this and was told my question was “outside their area of expertise” and to ask a tax expert, so here I am Reddit! Do I need to get a corrected W2 from the school that doesn’t include the tuition benefit as income, or is there another way I can get back the taxes I already paid on the tuition benefit when filing?

personalfinance,Dad wants me to help out with some big bills for one of his properties.,"Hello r/personalfinance,

So i have a situation on my hands and would like some advice. I will be speaking to some professionals soon regarding this but I would like to educate myself slightly first so I can ask better questions.

**About Me**

I am 25M living in NYC. I currently make around 140-150k a year and live in an apartment paying $1000 a month with roommates. I'm not super financially literate but I do know to save my money. I have roughly 20k in my savings and \~100k in investment accounts.

**The Situation**

My dad purchased an vacation apartment couple years ago in full(\~450k) and put my name on the deed with him since he plans of giving me the apartment (for free). This will become important later.

EDIT: Not a tax bill. It's a loan he took out with his siblings in a family owned LLC. His portion of the loan he needs to pay is \~400k.

My dads and his siblings own an LLC. They took out a loan awhile ago and my dad now needs to pay his portion which is \~400k. ~~was hit by a big tax(?) bill recently~~ . He's been struggling with money the past couple of years because of COVID and tenants not paying him money. There are some tenants who haven't paid in years. He asked me to take out a 15 year mortgage(?) on the vacation apartment (\~250k in total) and to give it to him. He doesn't do it himself because he said the interest rate for him is higher since he doesn't have a stable salary. I, on the other hand, do have a track record/history for my salary which will give me a lower rate. **He also mentioned a couple of pros of doing this**:

* Something about this helping me pay less in taxes? Since I will be paying a mortgage every month, I'm assuming this is tax deductible.
* Having a mortgage/consistent payments will be good for my credit score
* Currently, he see's the apartment as HIS and has some ""rules"" in the apartment. If I give him the money, it'll practically be 50:50 owners.

I don't mind doing this at all. I get to actually pay for the apartment that my dad will eventually pass along to me which will be like a 100%+ investment. And **more importantly,** I get to help lessen some of my dads financial stress.

I think I can handle the mortgage but my GF is worried it'll hurt our future. One reason is that we currently don't live together but have plans on moving in together soon which would be another 2-3k expense every month.

I guess my questions are:

1. Is the tax deductible thing true?
2. Do you think it's a smart decision?
3. Do you think I'm financially capable of this?
4. My GF told me this is a home equity loan but my parents say it's a mortgage. What is it?

This is my first time posting in here but I've been subbed for quite some time. From what I've seen, you guys know a lot more about personal finance and getting yourself on a strict financial plan to eliminate debts than I, so with that said, I was hoping to get some advice on how I should proceed with my current financial situation.

For starters, I am 30 years old and I have what feels like massive credit card debt that is starting to really effect my credit score (I have went from Great Credit to somewhere in-between Good/Fair across the 3 major credit bureaus), which is one of my primary reasons for concern, as I would really like to buy a house in the next year to 18 months, if even possible. I am currently leasing an apartment. I live in the United States (Houston, TX -- if that matters, just to give you an idea of location). I don't like making excuses but due to the pandemic, a career change, and a move, I was forced to use my credit cards much more than I would have liked over the past year and a half. I also was forced to completely wipe out my savings during this time period. Now, I have a good job again, and I will have more money coming in in the future months, so I will be able to save a little, but I realize I need to tackle this debt first and I am very frustrated with where I sit at this moment in time and don't know exactly how to proceed.


First and foremost, to get down to numbers, I have $11,000 in credit card debt at this moment. This is spread across 3 separate cards. 2 of which account for $4,000 and I am being charged an interest rate of 24.24% monthly on both of these. I have never missed a payment and most of the time I pay more than the minimum.

The other $7000 is on a card that has yet to accrue interest payments, these will begin next month. (I have the option to transfer this balance for 12 months at 0% APR but a 5% transfer fee, if needed).

Any advice is welcomed but I have two primary questions that I would like some thoughts on. 

First, this feels obvious but I have never been in this situation so I wanted to clarify, should I pay the $350 and move the $7000 via balance transfer? Can someone more intelligent than I give me an ELI5 of how a balance transfer works? I figure I could then begin paying this card down and not using it. 

Secondly, how should I tackle the other $4000? Does it make sense to take out a small personal loan (or debt consolidation) at a rate of ~13-14% interest and immediately pay the credit cards off and only have one monthly payment? Or does it make more sense to just pay more than the minimum each month and stop using the cards completely, while being charged a higher interest rate? Disclaimer - I would stop using the cards if I were to take out a loan as well. I am aware that I need to full-stop raising my cc debt.

Any advice helps. Please and thank you.",finance,1644462571.0

I don't feel very confident in my understanding of the process though, so I could be totally wrong.  

For example, today we spoke to the company our mortgage is currently through.  The home value is about $120,000 over what we owe, it's a manufactured home-real property, currently a FHA loan with mortgage insurance.  We don't want cash, just to refinance into a conventional loan to get rid of the mortgage insurance and get a lower interest rate since our credit scores have improved since buying.  They gave a quote for a  FHA loan with a lower interest rate but when we reminded them that we were also wanting to get rid of the PMI they said that a manufactured home cant be refinanced on a conventional loan.  If I look it up  it does seem to be a thing, but maybe I'm just not understanding or reading bad sources.  Perhaps it's that  *they* don't do it and are pushing what they want us to get.

Yeah, I know a 72-month auto loan is a bad idea, but it fit my circumstances at the time, and the interest is high because I got the loan with a somewhat low credit score of 640'ish (I'm at 675-715 now depending on where you look).

Anyway, in April, the last of my negative payment history will fall off my credit reports (yay!) and as such I was considering refinancing to a lower interest rate. Right now, I've just been looking at offers on Credit Karma, and it looks like I'll be able to get \~$100 shaved off my minimum payment at a rate of about 4%. This will increase the loan term by about 6 months, but I plan on paying the same $380 I have been paying to get it paid off sooner.

Now finally on to my question: I also wanted to get a second credit card this year, something with better rewards. So I want to try and keep as much as I can of the score boost I get when my bad history falls off in April. What I'm worried about is my average credit age on my credit report.

If so, I'm not so sure taking a second hit from a new credit card would be a good idea. Any thoughts?",finance,1644468113.0
personalfinance,Chase Home Lending won't approve my loan because of a broken window.,"I am a first time home buyer and I'm not too sure if I am understanding right but, Chase will not approve my loan due to a broken window ""being a saftey concern"". The thing about this is that I won't be living in the home yet, as there are minor renovations required after close. The main problems are that the close date is advancing quickly (Feb. 28th), I have a locked interest rate, and the seller is unable to get this window replaced quickly (due to labor and material shortages). 

I have talked to my LO about the issue and she states ""There is nothing that can be done about it and the window IS REQUIRED TO BE REPAIRED BY CLOSE and a new inspection/apprasial be done"" or else I will be required to pay an additional 200$ every 15 days to extend my rate lock. 

Nothing seems to please the apprasial gods according to her, no intent to repair from the seller, pre payment for labor and materials or even the cost to repair being knocked off the cost of the home. 

Something about the lenders response seems fishy, as if they are just making excuses to draw out my close date. As far as I know intent to repair should suffice to continue to close, especially for something as trivial as a window (that's double paned mind you...therefore there is still a window keeping stuff and things out).

I intend to give a heartfelt phone call in a few days due to the amount of uninvolvment on chases end and making me do all the leg work for papers being sent to escrow and having constant contact with the seller AND NOW A WINDOW? It's ridiculous...I am wondering why exactly these loan officers get paid...they are essentially a middle man as far as I know as I have no support from them besides THEM telling ME what I NEED TO DO NEXT

TL;DR

Chase says no money bc broken window = bad....a broken window is such a deal breaker and can't be replaced quickly so therefore pay us more money so we don't make you pay us even more money for 30 years.

After I done everything he saw my other car loan from Capital One, he said it looks like you pay 7% interest rate on this loan, I can give you only 2% if we take over this loan. I said okay so now he opened  the 4th account, 2 Loans, a credit card and a credit line.

I checked my credit and All 3 credit agencies dropped 30 points.

Bitcoin,"If BTC wins, how is it truly different?","Why isn’t Bitcoin still vulnerable to fractional reserve issues?

I get that no new Bitcoin can exist outside of the 21 million.  I know a lot of us advocate for getting crypto off exchanges for re-hypothecation reasons.  But how does Bitcoin actually solve this?

I’m talking post a hypothetical mass adaption phase.  If it does play out this way then great.  People who got on board before have generational wealth.  But we look at this thing and extrapolate based on current exploitations of Keynesian monetary theory and current central banking machinations.  

Let me try and explain my thoughts on this:

Year is 2xxx.  Hyperbitcoinization is over and done with.  It is the world reserve currency.  Barring for authoritarian nation states who have outlawed its use, the world transacts in BTC.  Modern Exchanges have become defunct as no one needs to purchase via fiat conversion.

Everyone has and earns varying amounts of it.  By this point, many have heard stories or experienced first-hand the risks of self-custody.  Some are responsible enough for this; many are not.  People want to act in their perceived self interest, so they store their Bitcoin with custodians who are protected via the modern equivalent of FDIC insurance,etc. Banks have replaced their fiat with BTC and operate under this new paradigm.

Humans born prior to the adoption have accumulated.  Humans born after have not.  They must earn and accumulate their own stack.  But they also must purchase the other assets they need to live (cars, houses, etc.) that are perpetually more expensive than their modest wage can afford to buy outright.  They need to borrow BTC now to afford the things they need now.

So they borrow from one of these aforementioned institutions.  The institution then covers the funds for the purchase.  Great.  But now the consumer is paying a fixed loan that is increasingly expensive in relative BTC until maturity.  During this timeframe their paychecks decrease in nominal BTC in response to BTC deflation.  Okay,  maybe negative interest rates or reverse balloon style payments solve this.  But…

These institutions have limited supply of hard BTC to do this.  They need to lend now in order to receive future BTC to satisfy demand for credit.  Eventually they run out and begin causing credit/liquidity issues in the broader market since there is no other trusted reserve asset.  So these institutions get “creative”.  They start lending out BTC they don’t have anticipating that their future BTC reserves while progressively smaller, will have a market value sufficient to keep them solvent.  They are allowed based on their protected status/trustworthiness to do this to some satisfactory ratio set by the market/central bank (whatever that looks like in the future).  Things are running “smoothly”.

But then some calamity befalls the world.  War, famine, pandemic, climate issue etc. strikes and now someone needs to raise funds in the now to pay for current needs.  Current reserve ratios don’t allow for this, so the local/regional/world authorities lower these requirements until they are 0 or even negative, issue anti-bonds, adjust taxes, etc. to raise the funding/liquidity needed to get through this crisis.  Short term this works, but contributes to faster deflation.  

Wages shrink in relation to this.  I’m sure you can figure out how the rest of this game goes from here.  

The ramifications of the legacy fiat system are still there, but in a deflationary sense instead of inflationary.  It is just done with a harder more democratic medium.  You end up just trading a system of savings that become worth less overtime for a system of savings that becomes worth more over time but functionally harder to stack.

Modern central banking and governmental manipulations of monetary policy arose from an inflationary capital system.  To think this won’t happen in a deflationary system seems naive.  It remains to be seen how a deflationary currency will truly affect supply and demand on a global scale, but I don’t think buying assets that are currently out of reach over time (credit) will become a thing of the past.  I believe in BTC as much as the next guy.  So stack now for the inevitable future.  But It’s analogous to the industrial revolution and modern capitalism causing “unforeseen” issues in the future as the free market devolved into the Byzantine system we have today.  If we want this system to be the solution we know it can be, we have to start thinking about this now.  The old system was good until it was abused.  Protect the Satoshi in the long run;  let’s start figuring out what this thing needs to be  to protect it from future threats.  The time is now, not when panic sets in.  That’s how we got here in the first place.  I just want, like most of us who “get-it”, to try our best to really “get-it” before it’s too late.  

TL;DR:

BTC has the potential to fail if the need for credit in a modern society operates the way it does today.  Does BTC really fix this, or do we need to start figuring out how to protect it from these threats in a BTC denominated world?",cryptocurrency,1644484001.0

stocks,Final stage of the bull market? David Hunter,"We're in an unusual time': A 49-year market vet says that we've entered the final stage of the bull market in stocks as the Fed tries to handle inflation — and warns that an 80% crash is ahead

Yes, it sounds crazy…

Contrarian macro analyst David Hunter now expects the S&amp;P 500 to meltup to 6000 by mid-year, to then implode in a 70-80% crash.

But Hunter has a history of his bold forecasts becoming reality.

In early December he predicted the S&amp;P would soon correct to 4300. As the markets vaulted higher, the critics called him delusional.

But things reversed in January and David’s 4300 target was reached on Monday.

Will this latest — and perhaps boldest — meltup/meltdown prediction of his come to pass?

# [Dow futures tick higher on Disney boost as market awaits key inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were mixed on Thursday morning of ahead of key inflation data expected later in the day that is expected to show price increases rising at their fastest annual pace since the early 1980s.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 43 points, or 0.1%, largely on the back of Disney. S&amp;P 500 futures were marginally lower and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Dow 30 component Disney jumped nearly 8% in premarket trading after the company reported a quarterly earnings beat and a doubling of revenue from its parks, experiences and consumer products division. Uber gained 5.75% in extended trading after reporting a revenue beat and a bounce back from omicron-induced challenges.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Twitter shares also rose premarket, jumping 4% after the company announced a $4 billion stock buyback program. Coca-Cola shares were up nearly 2% after the soft drink giant reported earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates.
*****
&gt; Investors were preparing for Thursday’s Consumer Price Index report, which is expected to show headline inflation for January at the highest level since 1982. Headline inflation including food and energy costs is expected to rise by 0.4%, or 7.2% year-over-year.
*****
&gt; Economists will be watching to see whether the monthly gain shows that the pace of price increases could be ready to turn a corner.
*****
&gt; “You’d be hard pressed to find anybody that doesn’t believe the CPI number’s going to be hot, because we seem to be playing a game of leapfrog, with everyone trying to get more hawkish about what the Fed may or may not do and monetary policy in 2022. That tends to set us up for a continuation of the rally,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
&gt; In trading Wednesday, Nasdaq Composite jumped for a second day as tech shares led the market higher and helped it recover some losses from the January sell-off, which was also led by tech names. The Nasdaq jumped 2.08% and the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 305.28 points, or 0.86%.
*****
&gt; Early pandemic winners of 2022, including Shopify and Etsy, as well as stay-at-home stocks like DocuSign and Zoom, were some of the biggest winners Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “The market seems to have found a more constructive tone in the tug of war between trepidation over the Fed and the better fundamentals that we’ve seen in both earnings and the economic data,” Hogan said. “Having Disney do better than Netflix after its earnings report certainly seems to be a positive.”
*****
&gt; Last month Netflix reported disappointing quarterly earnings, which added to investors skittishness towards tech stocks and the volatility in trading that followed.
*****
&gt; Bond yields, which have surged this year, cooled slightly, perhaps helping boost tech shares. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded near 1.945%.
*****
&gt; Twitter, Coca-Cola and Kellogg are scheduled to report earnings before the opening bell Thursday. Expedia, Affirm and Zillow will report after the closing bell.

Economists are expecting another hot inflation report, with the headline consumer price index running at a 7.2% pace in January.

CPI is reported Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET and is expected to show an increase of 0.4%, a slower monthly increase than December, which had a revised headline gain of 0.6%. The year-over-year forecast of 7.2% is the highest since 1982 and is up from 7% in December.

Core inflation, excluding food and energy, is expected to rise 0.4% in January or 5.9% year-over-year, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a monthly increase of 0.6% in December and a year-over-year pace of 5.5% in the final month of last year.

CPI is key for the markets since inflation is seen as a direct trigger for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, and economists are basing their forecasts for the central bank on how much they think inflation will slow from its rapid pace. The Fed has made clear it will fight inflation, and it is widely expected to raise interest rates multiple times this year, starting with a quarter-point hike in March.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

Consumer prices in January surged more than expected over the past 12  months, indicating a worsening outlook for inflation and cementing the  likelihood of substantial interest rate hikes this year.

The  consumer price index, which measures the costs of dozens of everyday  consumer goods, rose 7.5% compared to a year ago, the Labor Department  reported Thursday.

personalfinance,Mortgage Question: 15 vs 30 vs Something Else,"*Disclaimer: I’m a financial noob*

Hello Everyone, 

I have a quick question about the difference between 15 and 30 year mortgages.  I understand that a 15 year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate and a higher payment, while a 30 year mortgage has the inverse.  Has anyone ever tried to mesh the two and get a 30 year mortgage, but treat it like a 15 year mortgage?  To me, it seems like the best of both worlds since you can pay it down quicker, but your monthly payments are still lower if something comes up.  I’m not a financial wizard though, so my idea may be completely insane.  

I’m currently in the very preliminary stages of looking for a house.  I’m currently focusing on getting my student loan debt paid off so my debt to income ratio will be better.",finance,1644500333.0
CryptoCurrency,Crossing the Chasm,"I read the book by Geoffrey A. Moore so you don’t have to. For those unaware, the book is widely recognized in the business world as an outline for what it takes for a new technology to reach mainstream adoption, aka “cross the chasm.”

For those interested, it’s a great full read and also great as a Blink, if you use Blinkist. For those wanting an even briefer summary and my take on crypto’s current place relative to the chasm - see below:

First, the book defines 5 user categories that a new technology will encounter and must influence in order to reach mainstream adoption and success:
- Innovators - Those who explore the first prototypes of a new technology. Every technology will have a few, but creating enthusiastic champions of the technology at this stage is critical to onboarding the next group. In crypto, these are the earliest developers and investors.
- Early adopters - Those who are equally early to a new technology, but unlike innovators are less likely to be developers and technologists. This group can easily imagine the technology growing, and appreciate the early advancements in the segment. Like your iPhone enthusiasts that are first in line and willing to suffer a few growing pains with a new device as Apple works out the early updates.
- Early Majority - Roughly one third of total eventual users. These will be driven by strong practicality and will tend to avoid buying in until they’ve confirmed the new tech is not just a passing fad. This group is key to growth and stability in the new market segment.
- Late Majority - Roughly the next third of total eventual users. These people share early majority characteristics but need hard proof of concept, ease of product use, and often only trust a new product when it’s brought to them by a widely recognized company name.
- Laggards - The final segment of users that will never seek out the tech on their own. The only time they’ll touch new tech is when it’s “buried” within something else they use. The book’s example is use of a microprocessor because it’s a component in your car’s brakes. 

So, “crossing the chasm” refers in particular to transitioning beyond the early adopter category to the early majority and beyond.

Nerdy statistics insert: If you drew the categories above as a bell curve, the first category would be outside two standard deviations on the left of the curve, the second would be between one and two standard deviations on the left, the third would be the large chunk between one standard deviation and the mean, the fourth would mirror the third on the right side of the curve, and the last would be outside one standard deviation on the right. This is illustrated in the cover of the book for those interested in seeing it drawn up, and the book cover shows a decent gap between the second and third categories to represent the chasm to be crossed. You can imagine the technology passing from left to right in the curve as it progresses and grows.

Investor notes: Investors in the first two user stages of a successful market segment can expect to make life-changing money as the technology groups through the two majority user groups. While money can still be made in the later stages of the tech’s adoption, the returns are of course diminishing the further along the adoption curve you go.

So, what’s the outline for crossing the chasm and reaching late adoption? The book describes it as forming an “invasion force” of early adopters, investors, and companies and then aggressively unleashing it upon a specific market niche. That’s right - it’s essentially a hot marketing campaign that takes hold before losing steam. The faster the message travels, the better; also, the more specific and targeted the niche you focus on, the better. Proof to the non-believers: nearly everyone can picture the iconic early silhouetted iPhone advertisements to this day because it was one of the most successful marketing campaigns ever seen. The advertising was a consistent blitz early on, word traveled fast, and the focus niche was young adults seeking to have a new, sleek, hip technology that consolidated music and communication devices. Adoption came swiftly, to say the least.

Where are we at: The crypto space is firmly in the early adoption phase, and I believe we are seeing the segment actively begin to cross the chasm. I believe the Super Bowl will be huge for the marketing push to the larger population. I believe banks adding crypto investments for their clients preaches practicality and dismisses the fad suspicion for the early majority. I believe projects and companies focusing on gamer niches are setting themselves up for success, but have less confidence in projects or companies approaching the space with a “shotgun blast” of attacking too many functions or niches at once.

Your responsibility as an early adopter: I also recognize that this is perhaps the most critical transition for the crypto space. In helping secure the space, I believe every one of us plays a role, too. Here’s where we come in: If you’re reading this, you’re an early adopter (congrats!). You’re in the first few percent of the population getting on board. And if you’re able to outwardly be an enthusiast in any way, you bring others along with you. This doesn’t mean to scream about your investments from the rooftops, but to be willing to help others who express interest in jumping on board. Admittedly, some of the strongest marketing comes from those in your life that you trust.

Changes to expect during this transition: Realize that not all participants in a given market make it across the chasm. As we cross as a segment, we can expect the most pragmatic, marketable, accessible, and functional projects in the space will distinguish themselves from the rest. For every Microsoft Excel there is a Lotus 1-2-3 that didn’t make it. For every iPhone there is a Blackberry that didn’t take hold like it’s competition. I expect this to remain true in the crypto segment in the years to come as well.

My biggest concern: that decentralization doesn’t make it across the chasm. That centralized teams and corporations win the marketing battle over their decentralized counterparts and we end up no further ahead in our monetary policy and functionality than before. This chasm is perhaps one of the most unique in that regard - centralized and de centralized projects competing. So if you want decentralization to remain relevant, be an active and enthusiastic participant, use your governance voting rights, and find ways to support decentralized finance.

I’m interested in your thoughts and in open discussion - something I’d love to see more on this sub! What do you think about barriers to broader crypto adoption? What marketing techniques will be most effective, and which niches will be most important to secure as the “beachhead” in the oncoming marketing invasion? What concerns do you have as we traverse the chasm?",cryptocurrency,1644500801.0

personalfinance,Debating on paying down car loan faster vs investing that money elsewhere in the market.,"I’m currently sitting on a car loan with ~$15k remaining at 4.44%. Minimum payment is $500/mo and I’ve been paying $1000/mo since last Fall when we paid off my wife’s vehicle.

personalfinance,Our friend wants to finance a house for us. How do we navigate this?,"This is an unbelievably generous offer from a friend of ours that has taken a few years for us to accept. We have put many offers down on homes, but just couldn't compete with the cash offers. The timing of this housing market has been horrible for us! My spouse is now a full time student and I am early post partum and stay home with our 2 very young kids. So...we have no income. When my spouse graduated in 1.5 years, we will make a considerable income. Our friend wants to finance our house for the next few years until we work again. 
We also have an opportunity to buy a home off market in a highly wanted neighborhood.  With our friends financing, we have the ability to pay with cash. The owner is very interested.

So my questions:
Is it better to pay with cash? Or have our friend put a mortage in her name so that we lock in the current interest rates? Can a mortgage be transferred? 

What is the best way to do this so that when the mortgage is fully transferred to us we will have the current interest rates?

personalfinance,Which debts to get out from underneath first?,"So I've been struggling with deciding what loans to get out from underneath of first. Student loans, or my car payments. 

Here is my financial situation:

I got $21,000 in savings currently. I want to keep a ""safety fund"" stocked in my savings for up to 3 months worth of expense which I calculate to be about $7,000 which would cover food, rent, utilities, etc. Which leaves me with an expendable amount of $14,000.00 which I add $1,000 a month to with each pay period.

My car loan:

I have $15,611.43 left to pay off and my interest rate is at 3.74%.

My car loan is structured to have a minimum payment of $360/m over the course of a 7 year loan (I'm on year 3). The minimum amount will not decline even if I'm only have $361 dollars left to pay.

My student loans:

Currently I am on forbearance and not accumulating interest until the end of May. I have 4 student loans that need paid down still.

1. $2,536.54 at 3.4%
2. $5,935.39 at 4.66%
3. $5,663.28 at 4.29%
4. $5,218.25 at 3.86%

Total of $19,353.46

These loans are structured to where as I pay down the loans, my minimum payment gets smaller as well. It started out around $350/mo but is down to $280/mo currently and will get smaller as more of the loans drop off which would free up more income.

My thoughts:

I am generally the kind of person who pays his loans off by highest interest rate first (not including mortage). However, this forbearance and the potential student loan forgiveness/relief (a pipe dream I know) have me perplexed on what to do.

I am leaning towards paying off my car loan first as this is actively accumulating interest. Then re-allocating all the payments I would have made on my car payment to my savings to put towards student loans after the forbearance period ends. At which point I would fall back to my standard ""pay the highest interest payment first"" method. Which would also bring down my monthly student loan costs since I don't have a minimum payment for the group of loans, but rather the individuals.

Am I making the right call here? What do you guys think?",finance,1644510818.0

I’m absolutely fine not touching my savings as I will have a separate emergency fund in a normal savings account. For these reasons I’d prefer a CD. But I will be taking out money twice every school year for two years, to pay for each semester. 

I settled on HY for the long run until I thought, since there’s about 4 months between every semester tuition due date, why not just start now with a 1 year CD twice (or 2 year if it’s out there), and then switch to a 3 month CD during the school year, to a 6 month (or 7 or 8 mo if it’s out there) between my two years, back to a 3 month CD for the two last semester until I graduate, and then everything goes into a HY until I sort my living situation out?

personalfinance,Feel like I'm going crazy- can someone help me understand 401k deductions and their tax implications?,"\*Edit for anyone interested in the answer:\* per the helpful comments, 401k contributions reduce one's *Federal* taxable income, but do not avoid Social Security and Medicare taxes. It reduces pre-tax income, but does not avoid *all* taxes. Thanks for your help, everyone! 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short: about to start (my first!) job with a 401k that has matching I want to take advantage of (30% on the dollar uncapped). Every time I've tried to calculate my take-home pay I get different amounts, making it hard to draft up a budget.

Am I correct in thinking that if I make 60k and max out my 401k, my effective pre-tax income would be 60,000 - 20,500 = **39,500,** so my take-home pay would be roughly $32,000 or $2,666/mo(North Carolina)?

I ask because using the same calculator, but plugging in 60k as salary and 20,500 as 401k deductions yields a take-home pay of $30,366 or \~$2,500/mo.

Shouldn't these be the same value?

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm here, I may as well as for any input on whether or not I *should* max my 401k if that would be my only retirement contributions right now. My instinct is yes, to maximize the employer match, but I am also thinking about saving for a car, home, kids in the future, etc. Not to mention having an HSA that I would like to contribute to. My guess is that still maxing the 401k is best, as the automatic 30% return is greater than the tax savings from an HSA, for example.

CryptoMarkets,How SME's and Start-Up Entrepreneurs Can secure microloans.,"It has never been easy for SMEsor small-scale entrepreneurs to secure much-needed capital in the form of loans. The reason is that the Big Banks wouldn't make so much from such loans and also the interest rates most times can scare SMEs away. 

This is why the concept of Microloans/Microlending is very impressive and even altruistic. Microlending is the act of granting small loans (microloans) to those in financial need. These loans are generally used by entrepreneurs with a business idea or SME’s who need extra cash to expand their business. They can range from $20 – $1000 and have extremely affordable interest rates (or in some cases no interest rate) and terms. The main goal of microlending is to help entrepreneurs who would otherwise be unable to borrow money to launch or expand their businesses, thereby reducing poverty in impoverished areas. 

Today’s microlending system involves a website like suku.world, investors, (a microlender that lends to borrowers in a particular location like a financial institution such as a small NGO or large commercial bank), and a borrower. Investors browse the microlending website for one or more people or ideas in which they may want to invest. 


The microlending website collects the funds and channels them to the borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. The borrower then invariably pays back the microloan with interest.


The most impressive feature of Microlending for me is the fact that micro-lending organizations also actively participate in the training of entrepreneurs on how to run successful businesses. This benefits both microlender and borrower because it improves the borrower’s intellect while also helping to ensure that the borrower will make enough profit to pay back their loan.",cryptocurrency,1644516989.0

My husband is a software engineer and makes around 145,000 per year. 

When I tried to fill out refinancing paperwork with [Earnest.com](https://Earnest.com), it did not allow me to list my husband's income, even though we share a bank account and file joint taxes, and at the moment I have zero income. When I chatted with customer service about this issue, they said they only accept individual income for eligibility. This is very frustrating to me as I have multiple loans I am needing to consolidate, some of which are private with high interest rates, and I need to start paying them off soon. Doubly frustrating is that we have the money and the credit score (around 800) to start paying down these loans if we refinance, but at the moment my loan payment as it stands is over 1000 per month. 

Are there any decent refinancers out there who do consider spousal income? It is profoundly annoying to me that this policy exists. As a woman with many other female friends who often temporarily leave their careers to raise small children and have student loan debt, this policy seems to be out of date.

personalfinance,Get rid of PMI or invest in retirement,"Hello all, 

I hope this is the proper way to ask for advise here. I have about $80k in savings and am deciding what to do with it besides keeping about a $25k emergency fund in my savings account. (Or is there a better place for it?)

My wife and I already invest 10% each in our 401k and I maxed out a Roth ira for each of us in 2020. I would like to use $12k to max out both our roths for 2021. 

We bought a house in 2020 with a low down payment because I was still in college. Should we spend $20k on a lump sum payment towards our mortgage to eliminate PMI at this point? We still have $141k left on the loan and pay $65/month on PMI. Our interest rate is 3.25%. 

Our only other debt is a truck payment of about $31.5k at 1.9% apr with 4 years left. 

We make about $110k household before taxes.

Edit: at my current payment rate I have 75 payments left of $65/month PMI. Which comes out to $4875 total paid in PMI starting not including my previous payments. That would be a 23% immediate return of my money if I make a payment of $20.8k to get rid of the PMI now. I would have to get at least
3% annual growth on that $20.8k to get the same returns over 6 years. That’s not including the amount of money I’d save on interest because my principal decreased.",finance,1644523590.0
personalfinance,Debt-What’s my Financial Move ?,"I am in such a quandary, I don’t know the right next financial move. Single mom/provider, dad contributes $0, 2 kids.  Here’s  my nightmare:

1-owe back due taxes from IRA withdrawals due to illness-preCovid. About $80K. No plan yet on how to address this. 

2-owe credit card debt with various high interest rates-ongoing. 35K

3-owe taxes on covid-$48K of IRA withdrawals from 2020. -I want to pay this back now to avoid paying taxes and just to get it back in my IRA.

Now I have some inheritance money. Not enough to pay everything off, and I already used a part of to pay off the highest (27%) interest rate card.  I have $50K left. But with rent at $3200/month it won’t last. 

I lost my job in 2018 and am battling a disability, so I wanted to use the rest of it to invest in purchasing a rental property, but once I’m notified of my back due taxes, I’m told the IRS could tell me to liquidate it. 

The credit card payments are crushing me. I feel like I should file bankruptcy but also don’t want to give up. I was making about $120K/year but it’s been challenging to get even close since Covid and now I have a few years gap on my resume. But I’m still hopeful.

Since I have no cash flow, I could get a non collectible status from IRS and that would give me time to get back on my feet, but I don’t think I’ll be able to purchase a multi family rental property that I can live in, which would put me in a better spot to ramp up quicker-meaning, I’d have some stability and can hopefully find a relatively decent paying job, 


These credit cards are draining my money. I can’t get ahead. 

Is there a way I can see myself through this successfully? I’m losing money so fast.  Thanks",finance,1644524970.0

CryptoCurrency,CFTC Chair Asks Congress for Authority to Regulate Some Cryptocurrencies - WSJ,"[Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-chair-to-testify-on-cryptocurrencies-as-congress-weighs-legislation-11644414710?page=1) has a paywall, so I've included the article below:

 

WASHINGTON—The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission called on lawmakers Wednesday to grant his agency authority to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying the “speculative fervor” around such assets has left investors in need of protection.

In a hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees derivatives markets, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam also echoed the [skepticism expressed by his fellow Biden administration regulators](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secs-gensler-doesnt-see-cryptocurrencies-lasting-long-11632246355?mod=article_inline) about the potential that cryptocurrencies offer.

“My responsibility is to assume that it will continue to take root and that this technology will continue to emerge and wind itself into traditional finance,” Mr. Behnam said in response to a senator’s question about whether cryptocurrency is likely to grow its role in the financial system. “If we don’t approach the technology that way, we run the risk of stability and safety issues and soundness issues.”

Mr. Behnam suggested Congress pass a law that would allow the CFTC to regulate cash markets for certain types of cryptocurrencies—currently the agency is limited to regulating derivatives—and provide it with funding to conduct additional oversight. Such legislation would aim to fill a regulatory gap, as some types of cryptocurrency claim to fall outside the jurisdiction of the federal government’s other market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The hearing came a day after the Justice Department said it seized over $3.6 billion worth of digital currency stolen during a hack of a cryptocurrency exchange, [its largest financial seizure](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-says-it-seized-3-6-billion-in-stolen-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-11644339381) ever. Two suspects were arrested for allegedly trying to launder the proceeds.

Regulators in the Biden administration have likened the roughly $2 trillion cryptocurrency market [to the Wild West](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-will-police-cryptocurrencies-to-maximum-possible-extent-chair-gary-gensler-says-11628007567?mod=article_inline) and said it lacks the safeguards that protect investors in stocks, bonds or commodities. But they have struggled to apply the decades-old laws that govern those markets to the cryptocurrency industry, which is [furiously lobbying Washington](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-fans-are-suddenly-a-political-force-11629115380?mod=article_inline) to avoid being regulated by the SEC.

Both the CFTC and SEC cracked down on cryptocurrency projects and trading platforms they have considered to be breaking the law or defrauding investors. But [neither agency has won undisputed oversight](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-2-trillion-cryptocurrency-market-is-drawing-interest-from-investors-scrutiny-from-u-s-regulators-11641119404?mod=article_inline) over the two largest cryptocurrencies: bitcoin and ether, which together represent about 60% of the entire market.

That is because of two things. First, many lawyers believe bitcoin and ether are, for legal purposes, commodities that fall outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. Second, the CFTC only has the power to regulate derivatives—such as futures and swaps—as opposed to cash or spot markets where the underlying assets are bought and sold.

“There is no one regulator, either state or federal, with sufficient visibility into digital-asset commodity trading activity to fully police conflicts of interest and deceptive trading practices impacting retail customers,” Mr. Behnam said in his prepared testimony.

The Senate Agriculture Committee, which along with its counterpart in the House oversees the CFTC, has begun considering the possibility of granting the agency that authority through legislation. The top-ranking Republicans and Democrats on both the House and Senate panels sent Mr. Behnam a letter last month asking whether he saw any shortfalls in the CFTC’s ability to police cryptocurrencies.

“Congress must work with regulators and the Biden Administration to design a framework that protects consumers and our environment and keeps our markets fair, transparent and competitive,” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.), the head of the committee, said Wednesday.

Mr. Behnam said the cash market for cryptocurrencies would benefit from CFTC oversight. Cash markets for other commodities, such as corn and oil, are dominated by companies. In contrast, the cryptocurrency market is full of individual investors. These investors often take on high amounts of leverage to trade. They also entrust their crypto tokens to trading platforms that have frequently lost funds to hacks and poor cybersecurity.

“The CFTC is well situated to play an increasingly central role in overseeing the cash digital-asset commodity market,” he said.

After objecting for years to meaningful federal oversight, cryptocurrency lobbyists have recently shifted their focus to convincing lawmakers and regulators that the CFTC should have primary jurisdiction over their industry. They say the SEC’s rules for traditional securities like stocks and bonds would be impossible for most cryptocurrencies and trading platforms to comply with, as they impose significant disclosure requirements and liability upon issuers.

“I think the CFTC is in a very strong position to do this,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire [founder of cryptocurrency trading platform FTX](https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-vegan-billionaire-disrupted-the-crypto-markets-stocks-may-be-next-11618565408?mod=article_inline), at Wednesday’s hearing. “I would love to see that jurisdiction expand to be able to provide federal oversight for the cash markets similar to how they do for derivatives markets today, both to provide consumer protection, protect against systemic risks, and provide a clear and consistent framework for the industry.”",cryptocurrency,1644528844.0

Bitcoin,The Inflation Problem is Beginning to Sink In.,"Inflations been over 5% for the past 9 months and the talking heads, media personnel, and the Government kept shifting the goal posts for the past 2 years saying it was all going to be fine. 

1. “Don’t worry about inflation. It won’t happen.”
2. “Ok inflation may happen but it will be contained around our target of 2% if it does happen.” 
3. “Inflation has started but it’s only temporary. We don’t anticipate over 4%”
4. “This high inflation won’t continue. It’s transitory”
5. “It’s time to retire the word transitory” 
6. “2021 was the end of this higher inflation don’t worry.”

CPI is now 7.5% which is still laughably dishonest cause anyone who briefly looks at how the data is calculated knows that’s bullshit. 

33% of CPI comes from housing. “4.4%” increase in rents this year? Yeah try 17%-19% instead. 

CPI is actually 10%+ 

Remember inflation isn’t experienced until the future (9 - 18 months later) Material prices are still sky high and continuing to rise. Most of my building suppliers have already sent emails out announcing 2-5 price increases throughout this year of anywhere from 5%-15% total increases for the year.

stocks,The Fed raising interest rates is nothing more than a monetary placebo,"The core issue is that inflation this time around does not have much to  do with pressures that have historically led to inflation.  If Fed  quantitative easing policy had anything substantial to do with current inflation we would  not be seeing local inflation around the world in almost every single  developed country.  The pandemic obviously has a huge role in our  current predicament.  COVID completely threw out the rule book for both  monetary or fiscal policy and the truth is our financial institutions are  not able to realistically do much to combat the core, fundamental causes of  inflation this time around (supply-chain issues).  Raising interest  rates at this point is only being done to erect a facade that the Fed is  actually in control, when in reality they are trying to control an  uncontrollable situation using old methods.  In other words, it's  nothing more than a placebo.  Worse, raising interest rates may actually  do far more harm than good in our current environment, because aside  from the FAANGs and a few other key players the US economy has not even  begun to recover from the pandemic and is actually in a far worse place  that it was three years ago.

CryptoCurrency,Small Actions to Influence Crypto Regulation in U.S.,"As most people in this sub are aware, there has been a lot of bullish news recently about large corporations, major financial institutions, and different countries around the World embracing cryptocurrency assets and working on legislation to regulate the space. Regulation is a needed part of any industry, but if done poorly would obviously hamstring the space and at the very least cause headaches for everyone who has invested. This is regardless of if you're just in it for the money, the tech, or both.

In the U.S. the average age for a Member of Congress is \~58 and for Senators it is \~63. This is a stark comparison to cryptocurrency holders - only about 11% of cryptocurrency holders are 50 or older. No offense to our gray-haired comrades here but our politicians are dinosaurs compared to crypto's main user base. What is even more important is that they are in bed with lobbyists and are only united in one thing - the pursuit of power and money. While there are [lobbyists in the cryptocurrency space](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/28/crypto-industry-heavyweights-form-political-action-committee-for-us-midterms-report/), they are dwarfed by other special interests at this time so money isn't necessarily on our side. That being said, power can be on our side.

Midterm elections are coming up and idgaf about politics (nor should I in this sub), but I do care about the future of cryptocurrency. I encourage all of you to register to vote ([**state registration link**](https://www.usa.gov/election-office)), vote with your conscience but also with an eye to the future of cryptocurrency, and/or write your current representatives about this issue ([**congressional look-up link**](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and [**senator look-up link \[top-left corner ""Find Your Senators""\]**](https://www.senate.gov/)). After some searching I have been unable to find a *great* repository/list of U.S. Members of Congress and U.S. Senators and whether or not they are ""pro-crypto"" **BUT I did find two useful sites:**

1. [**BitcoinPoliticians.org**](https://BitcoinPoliticians.org) \- shows politicians who ""have skin in the game"" and therefore are at least saavy to the space (and probably more likely to pass favorable legislation).
2. **HODLpac** \- creating the type of list I was looking for via it's [**HODLscore Project**](https://hodlpac.substack.com/p/congresss-hodlscore), hopefully in time for the 2022 Midterms.

personalfinance,Not sure if I should dump my ESPP towards my house or other stocks,"Hello,

I currently own \~$50k in ESPP shares for my company. It's a very well known financial services company, and extremely stable. Recession proof for the most part. We're not going anywhere as far as I can tell. It's nice plan that I max out. The plan starts from Jan 1st - June 30th, and July 1st - December 31st. Whatever stock price is lower, we get that and an additional 15% discount. I've done well by it IMHO. The dividends are decent too. I used to dump as soon as our black period ended, and then invest them in other stocks that my financial advisor(s) recommend. For the last year and a half I've been basically hoarding them and letting them accumulate. However, I am starting that maybe I should liquidate them.  The stocks were purchased with my after tax money Sure, I'll have to pay for the 15% discount on tax day, but any gains are primarily long-term. So, I don't see it turning into a huge financial mess in 2022. However, a big reason I've been standing down over the past 1.5 years is that I figured I could accumulate enough to pay off my house in another year or so. I only owe 98k$ on a 450k$ property, but it's only at 2.8%. I had had a 15 year mortgage but only 5.5 years left. I guess it probably would be best mathematically speaking to just keep paying it down as the interest rate is so low and there's so little interest anyways. The reason for paying it off is purely psychological at this point, so I guess I should just acknowledge that now. Perhaps the best play is to liquidate some of my ESPP, if not all, and reinvest the proceeds into something I think has been beaten down harder. My company's stock is pretty stable, but definitely not ""sexy."" Though, I will say most analysts have it as overweight or buy rating. Though, the gambling fool in me thinks I should sell some of it and try to spread it around quality tech that's been oversold (buy rated company's my financial investor likes) and try to ride those out instead.

When I talked to those same people in the last year about the power of Bitcoin they still do not believe in it or trust it.

I love that I can find information on the internet in order to research and with the knowledge that I have, I figured I might share some information that I know that could help a completely new trader.

I think with position sizing what's important is to have this conditioned to the risk you are willing to take. I read different opinions on this matter on whether to take 1% or 2% risk per trade. You need to figure it out for yourself with what percentage you want to realize growth (and potential drawdowns), as well as being comfortable psychologically if the trade goes against you. I don't recommend putting in more than 2% risk for a trade, since this can hugely mess up your trading balance if you have quite a lot of consecutive losses, let alone the distress and future mistakes caused by this drawdown. Now given that you use either 1% or 2%, you need to be able to come up with an entry plan that has an SL and a TP (aside from signals whether to enter or to avoid entry). 

Let's say that the SL is 5% away from entry price. In that case you calculate the size of your position that would risk the earlier decided 1% or 2% in the worst case scenario when price goes 5% against you and hits SL. Now this position is what is used for the trade. If it is inconvenient to have this position 'locked' for the trade, you can have a part of that position locked in as margin or whatever it's called in english and borrow the rest of the part to still have a total of the same position used. On that basis you decide your leverage:

1. Leverage can not be higher than 100/x , with x being the % of SL being away from your entry price (with earlier example of 5%, no leverage higher than 20x can be used otherwise you will be liquidated before price can even move 5% against you. If the interest rate is against you (positive when you go long, negative when you go short), then you want this leverage to be as low as possible
2. If you earn interest when placing the trade (negative when you go long, positive when you go short), you can maximize leverage up until you get to the 100/x limit that is earlier mentioned so you will even earn interest while borrowing the majority of the trade

I'm confident that this information is correct, but if I made any mistakes, I'd love to read them in the comments.

PS: PLEASE let me know any channel that discusses trading cryptos on order flow level, I would hugely appreciate it. Tomorrow I'll probably make another post about this either on this sub or another that fits my question on this part a bit more",finance,1644546588.0

My federal tax rate (22%) and my state tax rate (9.3%) bring me to 31.3% tax rate 😩. Our incomes have been steadily climbing the last 3 years and I expect they’ll continue to do so for the next several years and we’re likely to cross into the 24% federal tax bracket.

This is how my accounts are currently structured:

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is the greatest contribution towards the world peace ever invented,"Allow me to tell a story for you. Long time ago, there were a group of men primitive men. These men were strong but lacked other talents, and so they raided productive men to get goods they lacked. Over time these strong men had troubles of finding productive men, as strong men were universally avoided, productive men refused to produce anything as they were raided frequently, or strong men became lazy as following constantly productive men was hard work.

Therefore, the strong men made an innovation: they proposed to productive men they would cease raiding if they provided a fraction of their goods annually, and even better offered to provide protection against other strong men. The productive men accepted this, as they could finally live in peace without fear of violence and focus on their own matters. 

Naturally, that was a lie.

This is how the first cities were founded, as well the taxation, and this was the story of human race until invention of bitcoin. Before bitcoin, no matter was it a Roman Emperor, a Caliph, or a Feudal Lord the strong men could always raid the productive men, seize their earthly goods and tax them with impunity. In Gulag, Solzhenitsyn wrote the state literally tortured their all citizens in order to gain all private precious metals in their vaults, and the productive men could only protest by not being productive, hence the state eventually fell.

Bitcoin fixes all of this, breaking the oldest cycle of mankind: the government seizing the assets of their citizens. Bitcoin cannot be devaluated, forged, copied, confiscated nor raided. It cannot be taxed, restricted or tariffed. With bitcoin, the state is demanded to prove they actually have the wealth they claim to hold, they cannot manipulate the finances anymore with complex language and number games like they used to do. Every transaction is public, the people will know exactly who receives the money and when. Inflation, hyperinflation and excess corruption will become a thing of the past, like famines, plagues and illiteracy have, and the next generation will wonder why these were a problem in the first place? And to make things even better for everyone, bitcoin will be in permanent deflation, meaning if you work your ass of in your 20s and 30s, the value of your money is guaranteed to increase over time, a completely opposite of the fiat currency!

I am sure there are many other ploys governments all over the world have attempted, these were only a few of them. Even if a new totalitarian reign rises, they can never seize all bitcoin their citizens have, as their citizens can have multiple wallets and the government cannot imprison their whole population permanently. Sure, they will get some, perhaps even majority, but not everything and once that is spent the regime fall like they always have.

This is the true power of bitcoin, the ultimate goal of Satoshi. Sure, it will make you rich while slaying fiat, but making you rich was never the main goal. Once bitcoin has killed the fiat dragon, the states have to accept new reality and behave according to it. For the first time since rise of the cities and invention of taxation, the strong men cannot anymore bully the productive men, and so 99% of all violence plagued by mankind will become obsolete. This is the purpose of bitcoin, the world peace, and beginning of space age.",cryptocurrency,1644559178.0
personalfinance,Looking for advice on tax strategy after maxing tax-advantaged accounts,"Over the last decade, I've gone from making ~$75k to ~$200k (plus another $10-15k bonus likely this year). My ability to save for retirement and invest has obviously changed a great deal over that time period. After a promotion two years ago, I was finally able to max out my Roth 401k contribution. Last year, I also did my first backdoor Roth (and have already completed another for 2022). 
   
With my most recent promotion and bump to my current salary, I'm now starting to think about investing in a taxable brokerage account. My current plan for this year is as follows:
  
* $20.5k traditional 401k (not Roth since I'm now well into the 32% tax bracket)
* $6k backdoor Roth
* ~$15k taxable brokerage account
   
My main question: how should I be thinking about which investments to put in specific investment vehicles? I.e., is it best for me to look at my entire portfolio, think about what I want my allocation to look like in aggregate, and then put all the least tax-friendly investments in my 401k and/or Roth and move all my bonds etc. to the brokerage account? And is there a difference from a tax strategy perspective between what goes in your Roth and what goes in your traditional 401k? Finally, should I be considering throwing some of the $15k at I bonds (given current interest rates) instead of dumping it in a taxable account? 
  
For additional context, I have ~$175k spread across a few 401k and Roth accounts currently (all invested in index funds except for a small amount in a shitty 401k with a TDF as the best option), and another $30-40k in an emergency fund. I'm hoping to retire early in ~20 years if possible.

Bitcoin,BTC denominated world loans,"Made post about the post BTC denominated world, the deflationary aspects of BTC and lending. I got a lot of thoughts on lending not being needed or impossible, negative rates not being a thing, banks not being able to lend BTC they don’t have, etc.  

Got me thinking on what this model might look like and how the lending structure could work in the future.

Here’s an example:

John owns house valued at 5 BTC.  Wants to sell but no one has 5 btc saved to buy, expectation are that BTC is deflationary so buying now reduces future purchasing power.  Needs to sell though.

Financial intermediary steps in.  I don’t say bank, but you could read that here.  Offers John a contract, basically buying the right to sell his house through a mortgage.  Offers 4.5 BTC to be paid out over some term.  The discount is 20 percent, analogous to seller paying closing costs now.  Don’t take the numbers too seriously.  They would probably structure in some ballon payment way offering more up front and gradually reducing the payout as time goes.  

Steve wants to buy a house.  He only has .5 BTC saved.  He wants to buy Johns house, but needs a loan.  He goes the bank that owns the contract to buy Johns house and offers to buy for some amount.  Let’s say 4.8 BTC.  He puts down .5 down payment.  A contract for repayment is set up, probably a similar structure to johns with it costing more annual BTC in the beginning and less so towards the end.

John has “sold house” (really getting a passive income stream for the right to sell).  Steve has bought a house closer to a traditional mortgage.  Both are happy.

Bank profits the difference between sellers and buyers contract plus difference between interest in both contracts.

But why would John take on the risk of the intermediary not paying him?  This is where negative rates come into play.  They pay him for his risk by paying him interest to sell his house.  Let’s say -2%apr. If Steve’s rate to buy is 5% apr, then they make 3%.  If Steve defaults bank repossess home and resells.  If intermediary defaults, John gets paid by this worlds version of mortgage insurance for his contract.  The world works as normal.  

Intermediaries float between these contracts an are on the hook for large amounts of BTC they may or may not have.  We can verify with blockchain.  But as long as cash flows are good they are profitable so no one cares until there is trouble in the market.  Market prices shoot up or plummet,  interest rates adjusted accordingly, etc.  same as before.   

Yes people could just pay up front and not take out loans.  They could do that now, some do; most don’t.  BTC rewards savings, but it will be harder and harder to stack in an deflationary model.  Just saving up for big purchases isn’t an option for most.  But this model still keeps us in the same boat we are in with bank liquidity and market shocks causing booms and busts.  The gov will be “forced to step in” like in the past.  So how is deflationary vs inflationary different unless we solve these kind of problems first? 

This works for collateralized loans, but personal or investment would be different. No ideas on how capital flows in these scenarios but I’ll keep ruminating on it.",cryptocurrency,1644565049.0

stocks,ECB President Lagarde pushes back against acting ‘hastily’ over interest rate hikes,"Financial markets that have been pricing in faster-than-expected European interest rate hikes should, as they say, cool their jets. That’s according to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who pushed back at speculation in an interview with Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland that published Friday. The comments came in response to a question as to why the central bank doesn’t just fight higher prices with interest rate increases.“This would not solve any of the current problems. On the contrary, if we act hastily now, our economies could recover significantly worse and jobs would be at risk. That wouldn’t help anyone,” she said. The euro EURUSD, -0.34% was last down 0.4% to $1.1376. European stock futures indicated a lower open for equities, on the heels of Wall Street losses after much stronger-than-expected consumer price data for January.

As U.S. bond yields surged on Thursday, in reaction to that data, European bond yields were also on the rise, with that of the German bund TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.013% up 2 basis points to 0.287%. Bets on faster, higher interest rates in the eurozone have been rising since the ECB meeting last week, where Lagarde declined to rule out a 2022 rate hike, which some economists and market observers took as a hawkish turn. In comments to European parliament members on Monday, she also pledged a”gradual” approach to interest rate changes.

“We have to keep in mind that every decision we make usually only takes full effect nine to 18 months later,” she told the German publication. We are currently monitoring the rising inflation figures, which we include in our forecast. Inflation may be higher than we forecast in December. We will analyze that in March and then see what happens next.” Lagarde said one reason for optimism on the inflation front is that much of it is down to a “sharp rise in energy prices.” Noting how oil prices CL00, -0.22% have risen from under €20 in April 2020 to around €90 per barrel currently, she said the gain was unsustainable. Data released Friday showed Germany’s annual rate of inflation rose at a slower pace in January at an annual 4.1% from December, which was the highest reading since the summer of 1992. The European Commission on Thursday lifted its eurozone inflation expectations to at 3.5% in 2022, up from its previous forecast of 2.2% published in November.

stocks,So FED dovish is bad and FED hawkish is bad...surprise meeting Feb 14,"Very new to the market (one year investing) so I´m no expert and don´t pretend to be it. Just trying to do my best in learning and invest for the future (long-term goal, no margin, no options, only DCA).  But I finally understand the famous quote ""the market can remain irrational more than you can remain solvent""

The ways the market seems to react to news is irrational . We all knew inflation was going to be a problem so when the FED behave dovish the markets had a brief rally only to crash because the FED didn´t do anything.  Then they announce possible rate hikes (normal and healthy long term) and everything crashes again because the FED will start increasing rates.  Now we have record inflation (expected, not surprising) so it crashes again on expected news. Now the FED will become more strict (hawkish and expected) and the markets will crash again. FED doesn´t speak (bad), surprise closed meeting 14 February (bad)

Market Sentiment:

1. Raise rates announced (expected, bad for markets).  
2. Announce 1-5 hikes (bad, not enough). 6-7 (bad, too many).  
3. Announce 0.25% hike (bad, not enough); 0.5%-1% (good but bad to high)

So in my humble opinion, every news about the FED or the whole world this year (good or bad) will tank the market, nothing is priced in.

* Big companies are raising prices way above the rise of cost in labor and materials. This is proven by the increase net margin of big companies.

* Big companies benefitted from the Fed's bond and liquidity policies. They are able to borrow money for dirt cheap while small companies cannot.

* But shouldn't competition eventually drive down pricing? The hidden problem is that there's too much consolidation and near-monopolies in our industries. Big companies feel confident that they can raise prices because consumers don't have a lot of places to go.

So if these are true, we might want to consider investing in companies that:

* Represents near-monopoly (or duopoly) market share.
* Can pass along costs easily to consumers. Have been reporting expanding net margins.
* Provides goods or service that will not see decrease in demand during pandemic.

The post really blew up which I wasn't expecting. The support I got from the community here was amazing and it definitely helped me get a resolution as coinbase were very quick to act after I tagged their reddit account in the comments. 

Within an hour of me tagging them, the correct amount of Eth was moved into my portfolio, I got an email from a customer service rep giving me some actual information about what went wrong (no in depth details but they said it was a bug on their side) and they gave me info on how to make a complaint. I did this because even though my deposit had been credited at last, the coins had lost value during the 6 weeks they were in limbo, and I was pretty disappointed with how they had handled the problem.

I filed the complaint immediately and today I got a credit to my account in BTC that accounts for the loss of value of my tokens, and a bit more as a goodwill gesture because of the poor response I had received before. It's not a huge amount or anything but I'm pretty happy with this result.

Really I'm just posting to say thank you to you all for your support. People shouldn't need to do stuff like this to get issues with their money resolved, but I guess that's just how it is sometimes.

It was mind blowing to see just how many other people have had issues with coinbase go unresolved. The core of the problem seems to be that their customer service team is severely understaffed, but I don't know for sure.

Do I trust coinbase again now that this has been resolved? Probably not, just because of the amount of people who commented saying they had similar issues and were being ignored.

There were some great recommendations for other exchanges, I won't name any specifically but I'm going to try my best to stick with DEXs from now on. As a few people said, the best way to remove the risk of foul play and errors is to remove humans from the equation, and this is a great feature of DEXs.

I have always been living far below my means, rather frugal lifestyle and have always managed to save up significant amount from my monthly paycheck.

But i still pay rent, utilities, gas, food, medicines, some hobbies/fun and this month added up to another record high as an average. It is increasingly difficult to save up reasonable amounts,but luckily my decent salary + very frugal lifestyle helps. I can only imagine what those are feeling and how they might get along with their finances, who have more life expenses / been living paycheck to paycheck...

Latest reported CPI of 7,5% just feels like an insult and a blatant manipulated lie honestly and monetary policies by FED, ECB etc., just makes me feel angry and somewhat helpless. 

I am well educated on finance, follow economy/statistics and understand fairly well what is going on around overall, even sometimes listen congressional hearings when FED representatives are questioned. It really makes me feel angry at those participating and how disconnected (either intentionally or not) they seem to be from everyday average person struggles and the real effect that inflation has on them/us. Them continuously being wrong on their future inflation expectations / predictions by their army of analytic people involved is just cherry on cake. I understand that inflation is extremely difficult beast to predict and current situation has far more aspects (such as supply chain issues etc.) why it is happening. Seeing how FED/ECB have been acting rather irresponsible for many years now, increasingly more so for the last few years and ever since March 2020, when their preliminary actions were well called for, specially considering how bad pandemic effected/felt back then, but seeing how now after 2 years of new economic data coming in, equity (and any other asset class really) markets in bubble territory by majority of statistics and seeing how they **STILL** drag their feet to take reasonable actions against inflation, when inflation is running hot as ever...there is no justification to support markets, bond purchases, collect debt of a nation at this magnitude etc., as they do currently, has not been for quite a while now, the whole situation just makes me feel anger with a sprinkle of hopelessness on top. 

Their stupid rhetoric and ridiculously sounding statements even back as late as autumn, when one could hear ridiculous quotes coming Powell himself, such as ""not even thinking of thinking of rising interest rates""...SERIOUSLY, as your average responsible citizen, they must act more aggressively and sooner, as inflation is really coming in from everywhere really, all the way from housing to food on the table and utilities. They current set strategy is not sufficient in my opinion. It is their grand fuck up of a policy many years in the making. It is their duty as first and foremost that they should be serving their people and surrounding economic stability and not to great this frankenstein of an economic blunder, that they seemed to have played themselves into the corner of due to politics, power, greed, corruption and what not. 

I apologize for my rant, just wanted to get it out. I am well aware there are many other causes to inflation to point a finger at, just ranting really. On a more positive note, i am somewhat positive myself that supply chain issues and few other important reasons for rampant inflation will improve in 2022, combined with FED/ECB actions, things will improve significantly over the course of current year, it is just monetary policy and those involved, that i would give a grade C- at best.",finance,1644591289.0

## US House passes bill to boost chip manufacturing and R&amp;D

On Friday the US House of Representatives passed a bill that will to equip America to boost semiconductor production and lift its economy to better compete with China. The law bill, called America Competes Act of 2022, includes $52bn in funding to help semiconductor companies build new factories, and to fund research and development. The draft legislation also earmarks $45bn in funding to boost the supply chain and alleviate problems related to chip shortages, which have hit key sectors, such as consumer electronics and automotive. The next step is reconciliation with the US Senate’s version of the bill, the US Innovation and Competition Act, which passed in last June.

## One in seven ransomware extortion attempts leak key operational tech records

Once, ransomware was used *en masse* to infect systems and extort blackmail payments from the general public, normally in cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin (BTC), but now, operators are targeting high-value targets for larger payoffs. In what some cybersecurity experts call “big game hunting,” ransomware groups go for large enterprise firms, utilities, hospitals, and key supply chain players. Research performed independently by Mandiant and Cisco Secure show how thieves will patiently penetrate networks in order to steal employee credentials, asset tags, third-party vendor agreements and legal documents, project files, product diagrams, process documents, spreadsheets, visualizations, and in one case, the proprietary source code of a satellite vehicle tracker’s GPS platform. Access to this type of data can enable threat actors to learn about an industrial environment, identify paths of least resistance, and engineer cyber-physical attacks.

## Stolen crypto used to fund North Korean missile program

A UN report found that North Korean cyberattacks stole over $50 million worth of digital assets between 2020 and mid-2021, providing an important revenue source for the regime’s nuclear and ballistic missile program. These attacks targeted three crypto exchanges across North America, Asia, and Europe. This actually dwarfs a figure published by the security company Chainalysis in January, which estimated that North Korea netted as much as $400 million in digital assets in 2021. This isn’t a new strategy for North Korea either, with a 2019 UN report finding the state had amassed at least $2 billion for its weapons’ programs using cyberattacks over the years.

## Microsoft disables protocol used by malware

The Redmond company announced it temporarily disabled the ms-appinstaller protocol for the MSIX packaging format, saying it was being abused by Emotet and other malware. Microsoft patched. The ms-appinstaller protocol allows for installing apps by clicking on a link without downloading a full package. Threat actors have been actively exploiting a glass in the AppX installer to send malicious links in phishing messages. Disabling the protocol means apps cannot be directly installed from a web server. Microsoft plans to reintrocuce the protocol as a Group Policy that IT admins could opt into in order to control its usage within organizations.

## DOJ arrests New York couple, seizing $3.6 billion in bitcoin

The Justice Department has seized a record total $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency tied to the 2016 hack of Bitfinex virtual currency exchange, which resulted in the transfer of 120,000 bitcoin to the attackers digital wallet. Federal agents arrested Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, in Manhattan in connection with the crime. Investigators were able to trace the stolen funds through thousands of transactions to over a dozen accounts linked to Lichtenstein, Morgan or their businesses. From there, the couple converted the bitcoin to cash using bitcoin ATMs and by purchasing gold, NFTs, and Walmart gift cards.

## Google sees 50% drop in compromises after 2SV enrollment

Back in May 2021, Google announced plans to auto-enroll users into two-step verification (2SV) in order to secure accounts from compromised credential attacks. On Tuesday, Guemmy Kim, Google’s Director for Account Security and Safety, indicated that Google has successfully auto-enabled 2SV for over 150 million people, and have required another 2 million YouTube creators to enable it. Kim noted that they have seen a 50% decrease in account compromise for 2SV enrollees compared with those who have yet to enroll.

## Federal use of cell siphoning tech on the rise

According to documents seen by The Intercept, fourteen of the fifteen US Cabinet departments acquired products from the Israeli surveillance company Cellebrite in recent years, as well as several other federal agencies. This includes the Departments of Agriculture and Education, HUD, and the CDC. In SEC filings, Cellebrite claims to have over 2,800 government customers in North America. The company’s flagship product is the Universal Forensic Extraction Device, a phone, desktop, and cloud hacking kit. Most federal agencies did not comment on how they use Cellebrite’s products, with the Department of Education and Department of Energy saying it was used to determine if a government-issued device were compromised.

## Donation site for Ottawa truckers’ “Freedom Convoy” protest exposed donors’ data

The donation site used by truckers in Ottawa who are currently protesting against national vaccine mandates has fixed a security lapse that exposed passports and driver licenses of donors. The Boston, Massachusetts-based donation service GiveSendGo became the primary donation service for the so-called “Freedom Convoy” last week after GoFundMe froze millions of dollars in donations, citing police reports of violence and harassment in the city that violated its terms of use. TechCrunch was tipped off to the data lapse after a person working in the security space found an exposed Amazon-hosted S3 bucket containing over 50 gigabytes of files, including passports and driver licenses that were collected during the donation process.

I am confused on why this, in addition to standard federal withholdings is taken out? I did this for my most recent pay period and my federal tax doubled, in addition to the 4c witholding. Shouldn't doing this result in no taxes ony wife's paychecks?

personalfinance,Does This Refinance Make Sense,"Hi,

Our plan is to live in this home ""forever"", we have no intentions of moving. I regret not actually looking into this last year but I think it may still be worth it and was looking for some other opinions.

We bought the house three years ago and the loan was $148,000, 3.990% interest rate, PMI included, currently have $128,500 left on the balance.

New interest rate 3.750% with closing costs the new load would be $136,750 with the closing costs. Estimated savings a month would be about $160. So I'm thinking it would take about 5 years to break even on the refinance.

Like I said we plan on living here forever and from what I understand the only way to knock off the PMI is through a refinance. It seems like it might be a good idea to go ahead and refinance while the rate is still lower (even though not by much) and get rid of that PMI. Any thoughts?

Thanks for the insight!

cybersecurity,Business E-Mail Compromise 365,"Hi Everyone - We are working to understand a variety of attack points for BECs related to 365.  By far, the most our MSP witnesses with client's outside vendors or clients is impersonation attempts via an account compromise with a ""paying"" client.  Many of our clients receive large sums of money, generally communicated via e-mailed invoices or statements.  

We are very proactive about eliminating legacy protocols and enforcing MFA on our client systems.  What always happen is our client's client gets compromised and the attackers leverage that access and prior communication to them perpetrate an attempt to get the payment routed to another account of course.  

We end up dealing with a lot of unsophisticated IT managers / consultants, whatever who tell our client's client that issue is not with them because ""the e-mail address is authentic and they use anti spoofing on their gateway.""  In a recent circumstance we have felt like our client is not trusting us because their client forwarded e-mail demonstrates the authentic domain. They other side won't provide us message source data or e-mail traces.  

In this case we know the client's customer has 365 and we know that they had a compromise (they had a copy of prior communication) and a way to drop phony e-mails into their inbox using our domain.  Can attackers easily place unscrutinized messages (not through say 365 EOP / Defender) into a users mailbox with a spoofed address?

I'm too afraid to even mess with the loans on the [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) site because I don't really want it to change our payments until we have a plan of attack.

&amp;#x200B;

We're not sure if it'd be worth it to start making large payments towards these to pay the federal loans off early?  Or attack the private loans first?  I know I should just pay off the truck but that has a cost of about $1/day in interest so It's not that expensive to keep that loan.

investing,"The yield curve inverting, and what useful info it can offer.","TL;DR:  The yield curve may invert by summer of this year, pointing to a recession in 2023.  And history suggests that in ""bubbly"" markets like we have today, market peaks happen when the yield curve inverts.   This may offer useful signs to watch for to know when to run for the hills.

[Graph 1](https://i.imgur.com/ZPGOiiU.png):  Based on its trajectory over the last ~4 months, the yield curve appears to be heading for an inversion by summer, assuming something doesn't change its trajectory (and to be fair, it could).  Yield curve inversions almost always presage a recession 6-18 months later (average of 15.1 months according to Bank of America).  

[Graph 2](https://i.imgur.com/N1PV6TY.png):   The only exceptions in the last century was a false positive in 1965, and the Great Depression/World War 2 era when the Fed was actively manipulating rates to stabilize the economy and fund the war effort.

[Graph 3](https://i.imgur.com/yMbbJwz.png):  The Fed rate tends to peak or plunge when the yield curve inverts.   Given that it is poised to invert by summer, and [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) is currently predicting the Fed rate will be ~1.25-1.50%, the current tightening cycle may not make it to 2%.   This is important, because in previous recessions, the Fed has lowered rates by ~5% when a recession hits to stimulate the economy.  You can't do that when rates are 1.5%. 

[Graph 4](https://i.imgur.com/dYQkQuA.png)/[Graph 5](https://i.imgur.com/dPgF40S.png):  These compare the yield curve with stocks (as shown by the detrended S&amp;P 500) and housing prices (as shown by real Case-Shiller HPI).  For ""bubbly"" markets like stocks in 2000/2008 and homes in 1989/2007, yield curve inversions tend to mark market tops, with prices peaking or plunging soon thereafter.

[Graph 6](https://i.imgur.com/l6dWpe1.png):  This takes multiple valuation measures (Shiller PE, detrended log real S&amp;P price, Tobin's Q, Buffett Indicator, and Aggregate Investor Equity Allocation for stocks; Case-Shiller HPI, FHFA All-Transactions HPI, Freddie Mac HPI, and Zillow ZHVI for housing) and graphs the z-score of them so we can compare apples to apples.   We can see we're in both a massive stock (3rd largest in the last 140 years) and housing bubble (largest in the last 130 years).",finance,1644610120.0

CryptoCurrency,"Don't discount the macro risks for crypto -- U.S. warns Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen next week, US citizens should evacuate within 48 hrs","** UPDATE 2/14/22 — US closes Kyiv embassy. Moves remaining personnel to western Ukraine. Tell any remaining Americans to leave immediately

https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/politics/us-embassy-kyiv-closure/index.html


If Russia invades Ukraine it will send shock waves around the world. Everything currently points to an imminent attack and diplomacy appears dead. The U.S. government has told American citizens to evacuate as have other countries and U.S. Embassy staff are leaving.

That means there is credible information that an attack is coming.

**What does all this have to do with crypto?**

A major conflict will create a risk-off appetite in the markets and that means money will flow to safer assets. Crypto isn't one of them, at least not yet. And in an otherwise down market for U.S. equities, gold has been rising.

While Bitcoin, in theory, should be that hedge, it still largely tracks with US equity markets (not perfectly, but enough to not make it a good hedge.)

The effect on markets could last weeks or months depending on the extent of the hostilities. Does fighting along the Belarus border threaten NATO-ally Poland or is there a Russian attempt to take Ukraine's capital Kyiv, for example. 

There's no use trying to predict specific prices (no one truly knows even if they play ""expert"" in Youtube videos,) but suffice to say there are serious short-term headwinds blowing our way.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not only being used to help fund a military resistance in Ukraine, but Russia is reversing its stance on crypto and look likely to legalize its use. That might help Moscow avoid sanctions as banks start accepting BTC. Strange days indeed.

**U.S. Federal Reserve action on inflation another risk factor**

This is all in addition to the U.S. Fed potentially raising interest rates 0.5% instead of 0.25% at their next meeting. U.S. inflation was through the roof, again in January. All that money printing wasn't going to end well, and it isn't. Just month sago the Fed was calling inflation ""transitory.""

And while crypto, or at least Bitcoin, was initially created with exactly this scenario in mind, it hasn't acted as a credible alternative. Bitcoin's price continues to gyrate wildly, causing many investors to shy away from the asset in favor of more secure U.S. treasuries.

**Bottom line . . .** longer term crypto still has its function as a better, faster, and cheaper way to conduct business and provide new services. Short-term, get ready for another rollercoaster ride. . .

With federal withholdings, filing with multiple jobs is essentially the same as filing as married. Does this apply to state as well? Using  TABLE 2-BIWEEKLY Payroll Period in that chart,  I am calculating my total income (full time salary minus pre-tax witholdings plus my part time income). I guess, do I need to remove my federal witholdings from my total income when calculating this? I don't believe I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the bottom line of that biweekly table and with an income of $3722.5, I should be paying around $190-213 per pay period for state taxes depending if I base it off of single or ""married"". Based on my full time paycheck and my  calculated future part  time paychecks, I currently pay $150 and $28 in state tax respectively. So the difference between what I currently pay in state taxes, vs what I should be paying is between $12 and 35 or so.

personalfinance,How does spending a lot on credit card and paying it off over time affect credit score?,"I was confronted with an emergency expense, and had to charge it on my credit card. My credit card went from a $5k balance to a $15k balance, which would now represent over 90% of its limit. My total available credit across all cards is around $50k, so my overall utilization will be going up as well. 

I can pay off this new expense within a year. My bank will make a decent amount in interest from this ordeal. I know that this new expense will negatively affect my credit score in the short term. What I'm wondering is, could it help in the long term?

I had a $3k limit card about 7 years ago, and I stupidly maxed it out. It took me years to pay it off, but once I got it cut in half through payments, my bank increased the limit to $4k, and a couple more increases later, $8k. Most of the increases occurred while the card still held a balance month-over-month. 

So it would appear that, for that particular card, slowly paying off a relatively high balance demonstrated financial responsibility to my bank (the 18% interest rate may have helped too). Well, now I'm gonna be paying off almost $11k over the next 12 months. Could a similar thing happen to me this time?

Every time, without fail, it’s the same old story, BTFD and win, wait and miss out.  The whole ecosystem feeds on constant, near hysterical FOMO, and any criticism, no matter how reasonable, is dismissed as FUD.

This is perhaps the first time in bitcoin’s recent history it has been asked to stand on its own two feet.  How’s that going?

‘Bitcoin is a uncorrelated asset’ they claim.  Really??? Rather than a tenable new form of money from where I sit Bitcoin looks like nothing but a sink for the excess liquidity that has sloshed around the financial system the past decade; liquidity that is now fast disappearing as the entire financial system reprices what are historically insane valuations.

BlockFi Inc. is poised to pay $100 million to settle allegations from the Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators that it illegally offered a product that pays customers high interest rates to lend out their digital tokens, according to people familiar with the matter.

The penalties, which could be announced as soon as next week, are among the toughest levied on a cryptocurrency firm amid a U.S. clampdown on the industry. The SEC and state investigators have been probing whether the accounts offered by BlockFi are akin to securities that should be registered with regulators.


Scrutiny has been mounting on crypto-lenders, which have attracted tens of billions of dollars in deposits by promising yields that far exceed those available through traditional savings accounts. As part of its agreement with regulators, BlockFi will no longer be able to open new interest-yielding accounts for most Americans, the people said.


“We have been in productive ongoing dialogue with regulators at the federal and state level. We do not comment on market rumors,” said BlockFi spokesperson Madelyn McHugh. “We can confirm that clients’ assets are safeguarded on the BlockFi platform and BlockFi Interest Account clients will continue to earn crypto interest as they always have.”

An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been sounding the alarm on fast-growing crypto firms, arguing that some are offering financial services without adhering to benchmark investor-protection rules that banks, brokers and other long-established entities have long had to comply with. 

BlockFi, based in Jersey City, New Jersey, will pay a $50 million fine to the SEC and another $50 million to various states, said the people who asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. It’s among several companies, including Celsius Network and Gemini Trust Co., that have become wildly popular with retail investors for paying yields that sometimes exceed 10%.


Securities regulators from several states last year brought enforcement actions against BlockFi and Celsius over the accounts, arguing that the companies were selling unregistered securities with undisclosed risks. The SEC is also scrutinizing Celsius, Gemini and Voyager Digital Ltd. over similar issues, Bloomberg reported in January.

At the time, a Gemini spokeswoman said the company was cooperating with an “industry-wide inquiry” into crypto-yield products. Celsius said it was working with regulators to “operate in full compliance with the law” and a Voyager spokesman said it was routine to be in ongoing communications with watchdogs. The SEC hasn’t accused any of the companies of wrongdoing.

The SEC has separately warned Coinbase Global Inc., the biggest U.S. crypto exchange, that it would sue if the company moved forward with a lending product, prompting the company to suspend the project in September.

Executives at BlockFi have said they are able to pay such high yields to customers because institutional investors will pay them even more to borrow the deposits. Unlike bank accounts, the crypto-interest accounts aren’t federally insured.

Earlier this year, BlockFi said its Bermuda-based subsidiary would handle foreign clients. It also introduced a non-interest-paying crypto wallet and a new-interest product for accounts with at least $3 million in cryptocurrencies.",cryptocurrency,1644637892.0

personalfinance,What option(s) do I have to save for the remainder of my goal down payment on a house while tackling student loan debt?,"Excuse me if this post is all over the place, but my mind is wandering about the different options I have on how to add money to my down-payment-fund and tackling my student loan debt while taking into account inflation when it is at the highest it's been for decades.

Background:

Most of my money right now is cash or close to it. I have about $280k saved across savings, and checking accounts. Of the 280k, not much is in any stocks or risky investments. I sold off everything early this year and only hold about $8k of stable (as can be) ETFs. I do not plan to add anything more to stocks until I hit 300k, though I could be persuaded with the right justification. My taxable income in 145k/year through my main job, though I do have a second job that I picked up, sometimes allowing me to take home (net) anywhere between 10k-12k a month as a single income, though things could be slowing down here bringing me back down to a monthly income of about 6.5k. My student loan balance is 45k, @ 2.5% with a payment of about $870 per month. I carry otherwise no debt be it on credit card, or car payment. I live otherwise frugally and am able to max out my company sponsored 401k each year.

My thoughts and plan:


I should be hitting my goal of 300k by no later than end of May 2022 and maybe home shop early next year. I was planning to use any income after hitting my goal to pay down the student debt. But what is holding me back is that the debt is, relatively speaking, a low interest rate. With inflation trending upwards and hitting all time highs, I can't help but think what other options I haven't yet considered. I have considered that I invest the money instead of holding it in my bank account. My goal is to be financially free, or at least be able to not have to stress over money as heavily as I do now. Homes here where I live are easily going for a million, so I'm not exactly sure how I want to proceed. 


The other option I had was to strictly save and have a larger down payment on a home, and just slowly pay the debt on the student loans over the course of the next 4-5 years before it gets paid off.




Any thoughts would be appreciated.",finance,1644647730.0

stocks,Does anyone else feel like we are about to experience a catastrophic change in finance?,"I recognize that my perspective is heavily influenced by the information and content that I expose myself to. I’m a novice to finance and stocks and I know I am in fact naive. I began investing and trading in late 2020, so up until now I’ve experienced relentless optimism in the market, and in my portfolio. 

I know at this point we are all well aware of the 40 year high inflation and the gigantic bubble that is the US (and perhaps global) economy. We are all coming to terms with the fact that the face melting bull run of the last two years is coming to an end, and likely sooner than later. 

Now setting that aside, is anyone else getting the sense that finance as we know it, might be coming to an end? Monetary policy for the past 14 years following 2008 (plus a lot of other things) seems to have brought us right to the brink of economic collapse. The Fed is no longer being proactive about mitigating inflation, but instead trying to react to it. 

I think concern over the fact that the Fed seems to have totally lost control is warranted. To be candid, I personally don’t think this situation we’re in was an “oops” and it’s hard to imagine that this is all not by design in some way. 

I’m not at all a sucker for the narrative being created by the financial news shows, and for the most part I do not tune into them at all. I understand their spin weighs heavy on the underlying emotions in the stock market. That being said, this is the first time in my investing journey that the information I’m consuming is overwhelmingly bearish. Not just bearish though, but quite frankly *alarmist*. 

The economic situation we are in currently is probably something to be alarmed over, in my opinion. I think at best we will experience a proper market crash followed by a recession, triggered by the conclusion of QE and rising interest rates, which when combined with all of the other economic struggles the US is facing, won’t look pretty. At worst, we could be launched into economic turmoil so unprecedented, that we will never return to business as usual - and what I mean by that, I don’t really know. 

I don’t have a plan for what’s to come. I have no hedges against a falling market. I honestly have no clue what I’m talking about or what’s going to come next. This is essentially just an assortment of my thoughts and feelings assembled into a rambling monologue.

Please don’t take anything I’ve said too seriously. I just thought I’d share my thoughts here and see what others have to say. Have I just gotten sucked into the emotional market narrative? Or is it likely that what’s to come is going to be very bad?",finance,1644653322.0

BitcoinZ with its fair  launch &amp; pure crypto fundamentals (no premine, 100% PoW) is  completely immune to scams and “rug pulls”. Because there wasn’t any  founder allocating any coins to his addresses.

People who wish to register in WhiteBIT exchange can use this invitation from the BITCOINZ Community.

Why WhiteBIT?

WhiteBIT  is one of the top35 exchanges with more than half a billion $ daily  volume, presence in 190+ countries, 2 million users and  400 trading  pairs.

In  addition, it is a very fast-growing exchange, climbing to higher  positions in the lists of the best exchanges, during the last 3 years.

WhiteBIT  is based in Estonia, and it is a licensed crypto CEX supporting many  payment methods. Deposits and withdrawals are possible with Visa and  MasterCard, as well as Advcash, Qiwi, Mercuryo, Geo-Pay, Interkassa,  monobank and Perfect Money.

The  fact that fiat currency deposits are permitted also makes this exchange  an “entry-level exchange”, meaning an exchange where new crypto  investors can take their first steps into the exciting crypto world.

At  last but not least, this trading platform stores 96% of all assets in  cold storage. As with most other exchanges, the user can also enable  two-factor authentication to log in. There are also IP-detection  features, biometrics confirmation and more. All in all, WhiteBIT seems  to focus on security.

Positive Reviews

Most people in crypto possibly already know that building a good name in the crypto exchange industry is not the easier thing.

Many  clients don’t understand how to use their crypto assets. Or there are  fraudulent people who write negative reviews in order to advertise  “specialized services in recovering funds” etc and all these result in  many negative reviews even for popular exchanges like Binance or Kucoin.

Despite  this fact, WhiteBIT makes it to be among the top performers in the most  reviewing platforms like TrustPilot or CryptocurrencyExchanges. At the  same time, it enjoys top-rated reviews for its apple or android apps.  These complete the image of a reputable exchange that can really partner  with a pure cryptocurrency project like BITCOINZ and help it jump to  the next level.

What about BITCOINZ ? Why it has this impressive uptrend for weeks even during a general cryptocurrency bear market ?

There are four main reasons behind this move.

\- BITCOINZ had three listings in 2022: In TradeOgre, Exbitron and now in WhiteBIT exchange.

\-The  Project presented a new Dynamic Roadmap on 22-January-2022 in the  Z-Brain Meeting of the BITCOINZ Community. The new Roadmap can be found  in the main page of the Project.

\-  BITCOINZ is in a development frenzy recently with new developers  joining its Community and many nice advancements in the Project's  ecosystem like the BITCOINZ-DEX , the Army-Z , the Connect-Z and more.

\-  Most importantly, BITCOINZ is a pure cryptocurrency network that  follows all the fundamentals that the classic Bitcoin introduced for  years, with many extra advantages.

How BITCOINZ differs from the classic Bitcoin without breaking the classic fundamentals ?

BITCOINZ  (BTCZ) was launched in 2017 and is a pure cryptocurrency that offers  solutions to all the five “flaws” of the legendary Bitcoin :

1. Its scalability offered higher transaction speed and more transactions per second
2. BITCOINZ’s high maximum supply is the ideal for easier prices without long non integer numbers.
3. The  21B coin supply, in combination with the much more transactions per  second, guarantees super low, next to zero fees even if it had the BTC  cap and network load. BitcoinZ is ideal for transferring even very small  sums of under $10 with \~0% cost.
4. BITCOINZ’s  ASIC resistant Zhash algorithm protects the PC miners from the ASIC  elites. This way it achieves a Decentralized Network with truly fair  distribution of coins to the world Community. Not to the rich people  owning an ASIC device.
5. BITCOINZ features private transactions, offering true privacy for everyone.
6. (extra)  BITCOINZ is a green Proof of Work Network since a) it utilizes a much  more energy efficient algo than BTC b) the users can use their PCs for  other activities while mining BTCZ because only the GPU is (mildly) used  for the process and c) it supports more transactions per second with  plenty of space for future upgrades.

At the same time, BITCOINZ fulfils all the fundamentals of a pure cryptocurrency :

1. It was founded by anonymous founders, and it is a 100% Community Driven project, with no central authority issuing coins.
2. 100%  of its coin supply is distributed to its network’s supporters (miners)  with the Proof of Work model. Everyone if free to join it with the  mining procedure using just a PC.
3. It  had the fairest launch ever with absolutely no premine, no initial coin  offerings and no instamine period (something that is questionable even  for Bitcoin).
4. It  is an asset that acts as a hedge against inflation because it has a  fixed maximum supply and reduced coin emission over time with fair and  slow mining halving plan, every 4 years.

Why BITCOINZ uses the ""BITCOIN"" name and why it is really different from the so many projects that used it.

BITCOINZ  used the ""BITCOIN"" name adding a Z because it honoured and followed all  the aforementioned fundamentals that the classic BITCOIN introduced  (fair rules, 100% Community Driven, 100% Decentralized, 100% Proof of  Work) and at the same time it offed Zero fees, only PC-mining with its  Zhash algorithm and optional privacy based on the Zk-snarks  cryptography. So there was no better name to describe all these than  ""BITCOIN+Z"".

It  is worth mentioning that BITCOINZ is the oldest and maybe the only  ""BITCOIN"" named project that can still be mined with a normal PC, and it  is not a Bitcoin blockchain fork since it had its own genesis block.

Other  crypto projects that have used the ""Bitcoin"" name, did it afterwards,  in a misleading way, or they are just copies of the BITCOIN's blockchain  (blockchain-forks) that have given free coins (forkdrops) to the  Bitcoin holders. In such a way, these ""BITCOIN"" named projects try to  enjoy a high free exposure by distributing coins to the BITCOIN owners.  Sometimes bad actors from the BITCOIN chain-fork projects even steal the  private keys from the BTC owners that try to claim their free coins in  the BTC-forks.

In  contrast, BITCOINZ had its own unique blockchain exactly like Bitcoin  did and never made any forkdrops. Offering equal opportunities to  everyone by distributing the 100% of its supply to the whole world  Community and not to a closed team. Exactly like a real cryptocurrency  should be destined to do, being a gift of Freedom and Equality.

A Conclusion for the cryptocurrency moves of the last month

As a conclusion, the moves that we saw during the last month are a trend and not a random event.

The  biggest victims of this new downtrend are the very overvalued  cryptocurrencies and the DeFi projects, especially their tokens because  of the hyper-inflation and the many useless meme/scam projects .

BITCOINZ,  being among the most classic, pure mineable projects with many  advantages over Bitcoin, fixed supply and the most fair rules ever,  makes it to surprise everyone acting as a hedge against inflation,  questionable crypto and scam tokens.

This is our first baby, so we'll need to buy everything for the first time and don't yet know daycare costs, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

We live well within our means, and we're not sure what should do with our ""extra"" income at the end of the month before the baby comes. Here's a breakdown of how we've been using our income, what we're saving, investing, and debts:

&amp;#x200B;

**Savings:**  
We have 2 years' worth of (current) expenses saved.

&amp;#x200B;

**Retirement:**  
I'm maxing out my IRA and paying into my 401(k) at the max. company match.  
My husband puts 12% of his pay into his 401(k) and gets max. company match.

&amp;#x200B;

**Investing:**   
Additionally, we invest 11% take-home pay into an individual investing account.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debts:**   
Mortgage (min. payment 8% take-home pay), interest rate = 3.875%  
Car (min. payment 6% take-home pay), interest rate = 3.99% (we usually make double-payments of 12% take-home pay)  
Federal Student Loans (min. payment 2% take-home pay), interest rate = 3.4% (nearly paid off and not accruing any interest currently)

&amp;#x200B;

What should we do now that we're expecting? Should we continue to pay down our debt, particularly the car and student loans? Should we continue investing in the individual account? Should we cut all ""extra"" expenses and save even more? Or maybe we should keep doing the same thing we've been doing?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance!

*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to be volatile in the week ahead as investors watch tensions between Russia and Ukraine and debate how quickly the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates.
*****
&gt; Markets were roiled in the past week and bond yields spiked after a hot inflation reading Thursday upended many Wall Street forecasts for interest rate hikes. Investors were dealt another blow Friday after the White House warned that Russia could invade Ukraine during the Olympics. Both the U.S. and U.K. have called for their citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as possible.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed is keeping everyone on edge, and this is going to add to that edginess,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “So we had a three-week earnings respite from the macro. We turned micro, and this week we were reminded earnings season is pretty much over and all macro issues matter again.”
*****
&gt; The major averages slid sharply on Friday afternoon, and Treasury yields came off the highs they set after Thursday’s report that January’s consumer price index jumped by 7.5%, a 40-year high. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.8% for the week, falling to 4,418.
*****
&gt; With about two hours left to Friday trading, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told a White House briefing that there were signs of Russian escalation at the Ukraine border. Sullivan said it was possible an invasion could occur during the Olympics, despite speculation to the contrary.
*****
&gt; “Up until now, I’d say it was all about monetary policy. This throws an extra unknown into the works,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “The dollar is rallying, oil prices have rallied and stocks are selling off... Even if nothing happens this weekend, people will be nervous about it in the next week.”
*****
&gt; Boockvar said the Russian tensions complicate the central bank’s outlook, and an invasion would add to already hot global inflation. “It’s causing problems for the Fed because this basically would inflate oil prices, food prices, wheat, fertilizers and everything else and just make the Fed’s inflation fighting capability that much more difficult to maneuver,” he said. “The Fed can’t back off. You can’t blame geopolitics as a reason not to hike rates.”
*****
&gt; He said if the central bank were concerned about an economic impact, it could slow hikes.
*****
&gt; # Fed’s inflation fight
&gt; By Friday morning, some economists had ratcheted up expectations for the Fed to hike interest rates by a half point in March, following the January inflation report. Others, like economists at Goldman Sachs, have raised their views to a faster pace, with as many as seven quarter-point hikes for this year.
*****
&gt; Fed speakers will be a highlight in the week ahead, particularly St. Louis Fed President James Bullard who appears on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Monday at 8:30 a.m. Bullard added to market turbulence and the sharp jump in bond yields Thursday when he said that he would like to see rates rise by 100 basis points (or 1 percentage point) by July.
*****
&gt; “I think volatility remains elevated as we transition from essentially this more dovish Fed to this more hawkish Fed policy which we’re experiencing,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “We haven’t yet settled on how hawkish we are going to be and until we can chart a new path for interest rates hikes with some consistency, I think volatility is going to remain elevated, and that’s going to be more true for high valuation companies.”
*****
&gt; # What to watch
&gt; The Federal Reserve releases minutes from its last meeting on Wednesday. Investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes, the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet.
*****
&gt; There will also be more important inflation data, when the producer price index is reported Tuesday. That report is also expected to be very hot, after January’s CPI. Surging inflation has caused consumer sentiment to slump, and now economists are watching consumer spending closely. That means January’s retail sales will also be important when it is reported Wednesday.
*****
&gt; There is also a final rush of big earnings reports, with Cisco, Nvidia and AIG Wednesday. Walmart reports Thursday, and Deere reports Friday.
*****
&gt; “We’re starting to transition beyond earnings, I think investors took a fair amount of comfort that profit margins stayed as high as they did,” said Palfrey. “I think the question is as we look out at the next couple of quarters, are we able to pass through prices at the same rate?”
*****
&gt; # Fed debate
&gt; Palfrey said investors are looking for more clear communications from the central bank. Bullard is the only Fed official who endorsed a 50-basis-point hike, while others, like Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she does not expect to raise the fed funds target rate by more than a quarter point. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has left the door open to a half point hike but did not say he favored it.
*****
&gt; Fed Governor Lael Brainard speaks Friday, as does Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Mester speaks Thursday.
*****
&gt; Other Fed officials have pushed back on Bullard’s comments. But still, there is a high level of uncertainty in the market, and bond pros are wondering if the St. Louis Fed chief will walk back his comments Monday morning.
*****
&gt; Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said some investors wonder if market volatility could slow the central bank’s tightening path.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is full steam ahead. They have to be... They’re still adding to the balance sheet. We’re still at zero on rates,” she said. “There’s nothing in my mind, unless an asteroid lands on earth and blows us all to smithereens, that makes the Fed say we’re fine, we’re going to stay at zero.”
*****
&gt; “They’re admitting themselves they’re behind the curve. They let the inflation cat out of the bag. I don’t think they thought it would have the traction it has had,” she said.
*****
&gt; # Rate rally and reverse
When bonds sell off, yields go higher and they jumped this past week. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.06% Friday. After the Ukraine news, the 10-year yield was back down to about 1.93%.
*****
&gt; The 2-year yield was at a high of 1.63% Friday, up from 1.32% the week earlier. The biggest moves were Thursday, and the yield on the 2-year note moved more than 20 basis points Thursday. But by Friday afternoon, it had fallen back to 1.51%.

&gt; # First Trading Day of February Monthly Options Expiration Week DJIA Down 9 of Last 17

&gt; In addition to being Valentine’s Day, next Monday is also the first trading day of February’s monthly option expiration week. Traders looking to roll or exit positions may begin first thing next week. Since 1990, Monday or the first trading day of the week has a bullish record. S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed the greatest frequency of gains, up 23 times in 32 years with an average gain of 0.26% on Monday. Russell 2000 is second best since 1990 with 21 gains. However, since 2005 the day has seen less bullishness with DJIA down 9 of the last 17 and its average performance slipping to just 0.09%. S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have held up better over the last 17 years when compared to DJIA.

&gt; # Super Bowl Indicator

&gt; Americans across the country are gearing up for Super Bowl LVI this Sunday. The Rams are currently a four-point favorite, and the Bengals could struggle to contain the league's best defensive line. Both teams come into this game with their respective offenses on fire, and the last few weeks of the playoffs have resulted in nail-biting finishes.

&gt; One outlandish market theory suggests that when the NFC wins the Super Bowl the market will perform better than average. Conversely, when the AFC wins, the market underperforms. Although there is no basis of truth to justify these claims, the conclusion has historically been accurate. As you can see from the table below, the S&amp;P 500 averages a gain of 10.3% from the Super Bowl through year-end when the NFC takes home the Lombardi trophy. On the other hand, when the AFC wins the Super Bowl, the S&amp;P 500 averages a gain of 6.2%, which is 4.1 percentage points lower. The positivity rates have slightly favored an NFC victory as well (78.6% vs 70.4%).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/021122-AFC-NFC.png))**

&gt; Neither the Rams nor the Bengals have won multiple Super Bowls. The Rams have won just once (in 2000), and this is the Bengals third time competing in the Super Bowl. Of the teams that have won multiple Super Bowls, the S&amp;P 500 has performed best through year-end when the Steelers, 49ers, Broncos, or Bucs take home the trophy. After the Dolphins, Raiders, and Giants won Super Bowls, forward returns were negative on an average basis.

&gt; Given that the one Super Bowl the Rams won was in 2000, you would think that the last thing a bull would want to see on Sunday is a win by Matt Stafford and crew. On the other hand, in the two prior Super Bowls that the Bengals played in and lost, the S&amp;P 500 was up over 20% for the remainder of the year both times, so it's a bit of a push. Within the Bespoke crew, the Bengals are a near but not unanimous pick, Who has heads on the coin toss?

&gt; # Do Stocks Want The Bengals or Rams to Win?

&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks fall. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but “data don’t lie”: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 55 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won.

&gt; It was originally discovered in 1978 by Leonard Kopett, a sportswriter for the New York Times. Up until that point, the indicator had never been wrong.

&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl Indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.8% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 7.1% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 65% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; So should the bulls be rooting for the Rams? Maybe not. Stocks have actually done just fine lately when the AFC has won. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained 10 of the past 11 years after an AFC Super Bowl champ.

&gt; “Interestingly, there have been 55 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Of course, we’d never suggest investing based on this, but history would say that lately AFC teams have been quite good for stocks, but I’m also a Bengals fan, so I’m clearly biased.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; Here’s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories. The author’s favorite team, The Cincinnati Bengals, isn’t on this list just yet. Hopefully that changes this time next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

&gt; Lastly, Tom Brady won’t be in this Super Bowl and won’t be in any more now that he has retired. He played in a record 10 Super Bowls and won a record 7 of them. Maybe something he should be known for is the Brady Indicator, as when he won the big game stocks did well and when he lost, they didn’t.

CryptoCurrency,$GOG |And the goal of becoming the biggest blockchain mobile game RPG.,"#  Introduction

Guild Of Guardians is a mobile multiplayer, fantasy,[ action RPG](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27052/role-playing-game-rpg) where players build their dream team of Guardians and compete in a guild to earn epic rewards.

The vision of the GOG team is to build one of the most **compelling** and **popular RPG** where millions of players can turn their passion into real assets thanks to **NFTs**.

Their **ambitious goal** started in early 2020 and it is set to take off thanks to these 4 main areas where the GOG team wants to focus the most when developing Guild of Guardians.

https://preview.redd.it/0fddhf7ajfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=161c25ed2d1d990def51d63c94d413c0d4861a27

 

Guild of Guardians will be **initially available to iOS users** with the Android version coming late in 2022.

In this game, players will take their heroes through **challenging dungeons** to collect resources and earn experience. The resources will be used to craft items or summon heroes which can be traded for real money.

Players will be able to build their squad of heroes and will work with their Guild to earn leaderboard and seasonal prizes. If you ever played Diablo or Path of Exile you might recognize the style of play that takes place into games like these.

Guild of Guardians is developed by [Stepico Games](https://stepico.com/) and published by [Immutable](https://www.immutable.com/).

Stepico are a **mobile games development studio** who have released multiple titles with 5m+ downloads, while Immutable are one of the largest VC-funded blockchain start-ups and the team behind [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) and Immutable X.

Immutable X is a **layer 2 protocol** that will in fact power the core technology that allows users to trade with almost **0 gas fee** and with much higher TPS (transactions per second) compared to Ethereum.

This is a key point when it comes to **gaming infrastructure:** imagine how many transactions you have in a game, you cannot let the user pay gas fees for each and every transaction that they go through, otherwise it will kill both the fun and the economy of the game itself.

We also follow other projects in the same segment related to mobile blockchain games, so I thought it was a good idea to share some social media metrics of GOG compared to other active and developing games in the space.

For us, social media metric is a tool to understand where the actual project is headed and the potential reach it can have with a full release and a community flowing in, thanks to the game itself.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/1yo1pelcjfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab839ad5d296524065f07d330d608b95befca0c8)

# The Market Segment

**The global Video Games market size is about US$155.5 billion in 2021 and it accounts for 52.9% of the Digital Media market.** The Video Games market is by far the biggest segment within Digital Media and is growing at an average growth per year of 9.0% up to 2026. We see a similar development across all regions, **with Mobile Games still being the fastest-growing sub-segment.**

China, the U.S., and Europe together generate total revenues of US $103.6 billion from Video Games in 2021, which makes them responsible for a share of 68.0% of the global Video Games market.

**The global Video Games market is mainly driven by Mobile Games.**

The reasons for this development can be found in the general shift towards mobile devices. The high performance of smartphones and tablets nowadays allows for very computation-intensive applications. Games and some modern mobile devices even use special graphic processor units (GPU) and work on a similar performance level as stationary computers, laptops or consoles like the Xbox One.

This technological development additionally leads to a recognizable shift from browser games towards mobile games with an impact on the whole Online Games segment, as “the game itself” does not depend on the processing power of a PC anymore.

As Guild of Guardians is a mobile game, I wanted to focus this segment especially on the growth of mobile games and the main market where most of the apps are distributed: **App Store** and **Google Play Store**.

https://preview.redd.it/8uppfpiejfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a0111aa6cbda0cc291f5cffbb92dde393e10c15

 

With just the above projection it is clear that the attention towards Mobile gaming blockchain is high, as a working product could bring a huge user base to both the crypto world and the project itself.

If the above stats did not convince you enough on the power of **Mobile Games**, let’s have a deeper look on the following analysis that divide the most popular apps by store available.

https://preview.redd.it/098h2htfjfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5800718796eb597c3791f34d12bb8324a998dd8e

 

# Business Model and Revenue Strategy

One of the **biggest challenges** of all blockchain projects is incentives and economics.

Guild of Guardians aims to create a **billion-dollar economy**.

To do so, it needs to create a stable and precise **Business Model** and **Growth Strategy** which will enable the whole ecosystem to flourish. By having the **“Game as a Service”** the GOG team does open many possibilities for those businesses who are willing to build something on top of their core game:

* NFT trading marketplace;
* Lending and ‘sponsorship’ platforms;
* Community guides, newsletters and analysis;
* eSports tournaments and competitions;
* Social hub and gathering for like-minded players;
* **Metaverse expansions** into worlds such as Sandbox or Decentraland, 3rd party developed games and more.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/sjbwu34hjfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ddee4c43cc35b3647853001869c46f4556a32bf)

One thing to note is that the team said clearly that they won’t allow any **“pay 2 win” mechanics** in Guild of Guardians, which means that you won’t be able to buy items from their store. I suppose that the only way to obtain items in the game is either by trading with other players in the game’s marketplace (as an NFT) or earning it via the game itself.

# The Game

&gt;**Guild of Guardians is a mobile RPG where players take teams of heroes through challenging dungeons to collect resources. These resources are used to create rare items and upgrade heroes which can be sold for real money.**

The game is set in a familiar, fantasy RPG world where players can play as mages, warriors, elves, orcs and more!

Just a reminder, initially there won’t be any **“open world environment”**, although the GoG team stated that they might look into it post launch.

**Team strategy is as important as skill,** the team composition and synergies matter, as does the skill usage and ability to dodge certain damages.

[ ](https://i.redd.it/u3bnoroijfh81.gif)

**Factional, Class, and Elemental synergies all play a combat role:**

For example, teams of all Hordes could have their raw attack boost buffed, and teams of all Fire Elements could have a higher chance of inflicting damage over time.

**Traditional RPG roles** like Tank, Healer, DPS, and Support are valuable in Guild of Guardians. Player skills in aggro management, healing output, and damage output will be put to the test in their most challenging content.

There are rumors also of a combo system that would allow skilled players who dodge and time attacks correctly to rack up higher damage numbers.

As of now the game will have the PVE model out, but as it grows its user base, more gameplay modes and features will be added.

We usually do not post about roadmaps when it comes to blockchain game, because the development can’t follow a specific path, but we had recently an update from GoG team regarding their roadmap, so I felt it was ok to post it since it is useful.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/1spvo63kjfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7cd4e1837450e856efd92073e6ffc0cae3ff6f8)

Last but not least GOG has an **internal Guild system** which is for those players that love the endgame of a multiplayer (the best in class for each item, ability and so on, imagine like playing the game with the best items).

The only way to create NFT items in Guild of Guardians is from Guilds: for this reason the guilds will allow players to group up and attempt the hardest and most rewarding content in the game, craft items for sale and so on.

Crafting materials will be a drop from dungeons and players can contribute to their guild to craft blockchain items, which will automatically be sent to the market to be sold. The profits will automatically be split proportional to each player’s contribution.

As shown in the Guild of Guardians whitepaper here is the list of members each tier of guilds can have:

https://preview.redd.it/7au9dq4ljfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a3519e18a27aa87fbd6a9d419c9f305d0b7ab78

Also, just to give you a sense of how much people actually believe in this project, here is a screenshot of the initial price for the guild badge, feel free to check the price now if you wish.

[Here is an interesting article](https://guildofguardians.medium.com/what-do-guilds-actually-do-and-why-are-people-spending-up-to-100k-on-them-e3a169268727) made by the GoG team itself that will clear your mind on the guilds questions you might have.

# The Heroes (NFTs)

Which type of NFTs are currently available? Most of the founder sale Hero NFTs available are only sold via secondary marketplace as the minting already happened, but here is what you can buy currently:

1. Heroes
2. Pets (will talk about these later on the current report)
3. Energy Boosters (same for these)
4. Guilds

If you were among the lucky winners of **GOG Initial NFT Giveaway**, congrats, the Guild of Guardians team made a crazy giveaway during the very early days of the project and airdropped (to those eligible early members) an astounding $200K total value of GOG NFTs; to complete that, they have also dropped a GoG avatar for those that owned one of their NFTs as of December 6th.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ujb0ti4ojfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=632dde2ad83fd13666d86221d152bc9ae41c6b5e)

Heroes in Guild of Guardians are found from Summoning, which can be done by purchasing a summon (buying and minting the NFT) or playing the game and earning summoning shards.

As per any other respectable RPG game mode, each hero will have its playstyle, strength and weaknesses which will then determine the type of team you want to create to be as balanced as possible. The better a Heroes rarity, the better their base stats will be. This manifests in the form of more damage, more health, and more powerful abilities.

You will need to level your Heroes in the Dungeon campaign to maximize their respective capabilities. Even lower rarity Heroes become powerful when they are equipped well, and leveled up.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/8mmyyz6pjfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4eabe1d68b17f8286168e526cdf4892be47defff)

# Pets, Energy Boosters and Equipment

**Pets** are creatures binded to your team that will give you various benefits: **look at it as a companion** that you can use in your fights during the dungeon, this will give you bonuses both for the resource crafting and the increased item drop chances.

Each hero comes with the energy stats that will decrease when entering dungeons, the energy system implemented in Guild of Guardians works as a **“fatigue”** for the hero. Basically if the player enters too many dungeons in one day, the hero will get penalties such as stat reductions or requiring extra energy to use.

&gt;***Why is it so?***

The **play and earn** economy needs to be balanced in a lot of different ways: limiting the amount of “earn” you can have in the game, is a healthy way of keeping the token price alive and not getting flooded by the inflation of those that are selling. Not only that but it can also benefit on the scarcity of certain items available in game, giving you less chance of obtaining it.

This is a system that is well used in plenty of games, **as an ex World of Warcraft gamer myself,** I knew the pain and hustle you had to go through when waiting an entire week to be able to redo your favorite dungeon and hope for the right drop to come in your hand. But at the same time **this is what kept the hype alive**; week after week defeating bosses and hoping that finally what you have been waiting for would drop.. what a time to be alive!

**The energy booster NFT** comes into play in this case. This will allow you with a permanent boost to the hero’s energy and it will:

1. Remove the fatigue rate increase a hero would suffer when going into a Dungeon.
2. Allow players to use their favorite Hero more often.

&gt;***Equipment***

I felt the best explanation for the **Equipment** comes straight from Guild of Guardians whitepaper, so who am I to change it?

*“Guild of Guardians will not sell equipment, as we want the equipment economy within Guild of Guardians to be entirely player-driven and fair. We have hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor ready for players to find, create, and trade. Guild leaders will be able to discuss and strategize on what equipment they want to craft and focus on. Each one can have unique buffs that provide stat bonuses to heroes that they are equipped with. Certain sets of equipment may also offer boosts to your hero if equipped together.”*

# The play and earn economy

The words for the P2E or “Play and earn” is pretty much self explanatory, but how are you able to do it in Guild of Guardians?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qnrwsuxrjfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a535bd70ca3917a75b636b666397d2f691e11b78)

# The Token

The in-game currency called **Gems** (**$GOG** token) is an **ERC-20** token that will serve as the fuel for the Guild of Guardians economy and it’s **play and earn** and **community votes** functionalities.

The token was dropped through Coinlist, **where it was over demand by 82x**, with **$5.3m bought by 10,000+ people** across 100 countries.

For the lucky ones that bought into either Option 1 ($0.10 per token) or Option 2 ($0.075 per token) they are now sitting at a juicy ROI. Considering the current price of **$GOG** is floating around the 0.85$ range with an ATH of 2.78$.

More info [here](https://blog.coinlist.co/announcing-the-guild-of-guardians-token-sale-on-coinlist/).

Gems will be earned through certain gameplay scenarios (we suppose stuff like completing quests, defeating certain bosses, achievements?) but also tradable and used to perform premium actions that involve creating new in-game blockchain assets (NFT for example).

The team is also planning to **reward those that contribute to the growth of the game and community** through $GOG incentives that will, in the end, increase the overall experience for both players and the gameplay itself.

Gems form a critical part of **building a sustainable play-and-earn economy** and protect against bots. Gems are required to mint any NFT, and fixed distribution of Gems for player rewards will prevent unsustainable growth.

I highly suggest you give a read to the [GOG whitepaper](https://www.guildofguardians.com/Guild_of_Guardians_Whitepaper.pdf) as it is very well explained when it comes to how they intend to build and run their economy in a sustainable manner for the long run.

https://preview.redd.it/h4fd1o5ujfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e73e8c2dce40e517aeeef46400044c9c4053a76

 

# The Tokenomics

The **total supply** for the **$GOG** token will be of **1,000,000,000** divided as follow:

https://preview.redd.it/s3y3mu9vjfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e53088c4678fa3bed73abcbca4b0ebd02ea4466

https://preview.redd.it/fjnimvnvjfh81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7231c539f529ffe89f2ab83d254b96665e79f02a

 As of today this is one of the most fair, prominent and well distributed crypto gaming tokenomics I have seen: **more than 60% of the whole supply, yes 60!!** is destined to those that will either **play the game or help it grow** through contributions as described above.

The private investors have a tiny part of the supply **(5%)** which means you are less susceptible to risks of dumps and selling pressure from those who have a fair large amount of tokens.

Devs got a 20% allocation, but those are the people that will help make the game better by **translating players ideas into an actual thing**.

We all know developers together with the community are a big chunk of the whole pumping fire of the ecosystem, and rewarding and giving them a salary of course, is for sure a valuable play I would take.

The overall vesting and cliffing strategy is clear and well balanced; this will allow the ecosystem to grow in a healthy and linear path. What catched my eye are the three main areas that will basically receive the most tokens, areas that will be building the overall game.

# Partners and Investors

**The partner and investors range is relevant** and not ones that are going undetected. While we know some of the amazing names in the industry such as Ubisoft, Immutable, Sandbox, Coinbase, Naavik and many more, we also spotted one of the most well known **P2E Guilds** such as Yield Guild Games (active both as the investor and partner side); It was easy to sneak some data from the last [YGG treasury report](https://medium.com/yield-guild-games/yield-guild-games-asset-treasury-report-september-2021-1de8b56fdd5e) (Sep 2021) and the investment made in Guild of Guardians NFT is in the 3 Million U.S. Dollars range.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rl9dwkdyjfh81.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=015089e79f61f5cf24856a06369e6758aef46030)

**Guild of Guardians has also a decent media coverage which helps getting more general exposure.**

https://preview.redd.it/j5zppgj1kfh81.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88560daa1fda0250046d5f65a4ebd027da97f537

Other than a nice collab with NRG Hero, a **professional gaming and entertainment company** known for its championship teams and gaming lifestyle content. For the purpose GoG dropped an hero for the occasion.

#  Conclusion

If you arrived here we will close it shortly by saying that we had a general good feeling going through the whole analysis.

They got me (*or GoG me?*) when they expressed clearly the willingness of building their game around the community, which to me is always the crucial point of each game. As said other times, I have been a gamer myself and I know the key role the community plays in the process, so major props to the team for setting the focus right.

We will see what 2022 holds for us as it is the year we are supposed to see the first product coming out from the team.

Meanwhile look at the progress that have been made already in almost a year:

stocks,Anyone else think the dip on semiconductors will be a once in a decade opportunity to build wealth?,"Two major catalysts playing out for semis right now:

* Fed raising rates.
* Russia sanctions and possible invasion [cutting off key semiconductor materials](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/).

In the next few months, these will play out and really pummel the semi stocks. But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.

To be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a ""eat ramen"", ""get a third job"", ""cancel Netflix"" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.

These semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.

OK here's the cons in my theory:

* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.

* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.

* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.

personalfinance,[California]. Received 1099-NEC for 2021. Didn’t register anything or pay estimated taxes. Next steps?,"I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this if someone could point me in the right direction (r/tax?)

I am in California and did some freelance work for an out-of-state company for a few months while I was/am between full-time jobs. I did not receive a W-2 in 2021, only unemployment along with a 1099-NEC for the freelance work.

Now that I’m getting ready to start filling out my tax return, I realize I probably slipped up in (at least) a couple areas and hoping some kind soul(s) could answer my concerns:

1. I did not file any paperwork or register any sort of business license/LLC with regards to the work that resulted in the 1099-NEC. Should I still do so and/or am I in trouble for not having done so in the first place? I sent the company a W-9 and the recipient TIN on the 1099-NEC is my SSN. The work was always supposed to be a short-term arrangement and the first and hopefully last time I received a 1099-NEC. Hopefully just W-2s from here on out.

2. I set aside $ in anticipation of paying taxes on the 1099-NEC income on my returns but did not make any federal or state estimated tax payments. At this point, what steps can I take to correct this or do I just make the payments as part of my returns at this point? Can I expect to pay some kind of penalty or interest? FWIW, the 1099-NEC payments were dated from February to April 2021.

I've only been at it for a few hours and I noted that the lowest market price at the time I started lending was 0.006%, which although it sucks, I matched. But of course the corresponding actual and projected returns have been pretty pathetic so far, even with an initial $30K investment.

Bitcoin,Message @Satoshi Nakamoto,"Dear Satoshi,

First I want to say. I’m not a Cat and sry for the bad GoogleTranslator English. Im a 25 years old  random with big thoughts, hope &amp; dreams for the whole humankind in the future. 

I think we humans have been spinning in a circle of war &amp; peace for thousands of years. For many years I have learning of the human history and trying to put as much as possible in context with the plan for us humans. There is a plan of which I am convinced &amp; you have already been part of this story with the release of Bitcoin. The current events make me think about whether it is not time to break out of the cycle &amp; get into an infinite cycle of peace an love? 

Politics is made on the world financial markets, it is decided according to economic &amp; selfish greed for power but not according to scientific &amp; social aspects. 

A year ago I came across the GameStop movement on Reddit &amp; we all start to believe that we can change the world in a better place.

 It's about big bakes &amp; the richest hedgefunds in the world wanting to put massive short positions against the company &amp; drive it into bankruptcy As they have already done with hundreds of other companies. But Thousends of internet people &amp; gamers don’t want to see GameStop broken and we start to support GME that they will be forced to buy back their naked Shorts &amp; the whole world can see what’s really going on in Politics and the Financial Markets.

In 2008, billions were paid to bank &amp; fund managers, who had to plunge the world into the abyss with their speculation, while millions of hard-working people lost everything. We are currently heading for another 2008.

For a year now, they have been pulling every illegal card to turn the tide to their goods. 

It is a fight of the small &amp; the people against the big banks &amp; rich. According to my thoughts, hedge funds &amp; their news push the current conflict of Ukraine into the excessive order to force a trigger of a crash on the stock exchanges. Which could allow us to enter a new cycle of war (eventually the last for the whole world) 

But what if the small ones won and the big banks &amp; hedge funds were forced to buy back their short positions &amp; the money around the world is redistributed to the small, gamers &amp; Internet people. After more than a year of struggle, the community is going out of  money to Buy gme shares, while banks &amp; market makers can continue to manipulate the price with printed money from naked shorts &amp; the FED. We need support to change the game. 

The community on Reddit wants to change the world positively with the money of a shotsqueze &amp; give all people the opportunity to live freely without fear of the next day on actions from other Country’s or Billionaires or worldleaders. It would be the first time in history that rich banks &amp; hedgefunds lose against the people without having triggered a war in real life. 

I know that my words are a double-edged sword &amp; that many good people would also lose their savings, but maybe the money would then be in better hands. In hands with an open worldview in which all people are equal. Who support each other  when someone needs help no matter in religion/sexual preferences &amp; race or any other things. We want to clean up the world of the mistakes of the last Tausend years. We want to overcome the evil with good. 

If you want to get an idea of the GameStop movement, please take a look at Reddit (r/superstonk). 

We no longer want to make war against other people. We want to fight against the evil of the world. Against the lies of large corporations, Banks &amp; corruption. Against exploitation of weak countries. Against disadvantages. We want to fight against patriotism.

All people can live together in this world in peace I know that.

Exposed to the believes of bad rulers and greedy wallstreet. We want a world without war or weapons, without lies or fakenews. 

You could help us change the world by helping us stop they’re wrong game, the big lies of the banks &amp; Wall Street. I know you had a plan when you developed Btc &amp; I hope it serves the good, no matter what happens in the near future. Everything that has to happen will also happen but what if we could change the history 2nd time to love? 


 I hope it's time for peace for the whole world &amp; not again war. I would be happy to wake up one day &amp; hear that love &amp; hope for a better world has finally won. Instead of constantly talking about new wars, lies &amp; environmental disasters.

 I wish you God's blessing &amp; all the best.",cryptocurrency,1644690210.0

DAOs can reshape society by bringing democratic control to important economic and social activities previously governed through more hierarchical means. But as many people have pointed out, DAOs have not yet achieved their goal of true decentralization. Many DAO decisions are taken by a small number of actors, and we lack formal mechanisms to ensure these decisions are aligned with the interests of the tokenholders at large. As it turns out, these challenges are identical to the governance challenges faced by democratic societies in the physical world.

personalfinance,How to finance our kitchen remodel?,"(On mobile, sorry for any formatting issues)

My wife and I are at a loss with how we should go about financing our kitchen remodel. Here are the facts:

Home is about 465k, give or take. It is our forever home.

Mortgage is 352k at 2.5%. Payment is 2,250 but we pay 2,600 per month. 

We have no other debt. 

The quote for our kitchen (roomy quote, will not likely be over this amount) is 137k. Construction is to begin around August 2022. In 3-5 years we also want to do a bathroom and back room remodel, maybe around 50-60k but not sure. 

We will have about 40k in cash savings to apply toward the remodel. 

We applied for a HELOC and were preliminarily approved for 90k starting at 2.5% interest (note: they valued our house at 495k which we think is high but they aren’t requiring an appraisal). But the variable interest rate scares us as we are very risk averse and don’t like interest.

Our gross monthly income is around 24k but after taxes, retirement, and savings our net income is about 8k. We would be comfortable paying about 1.5k per month on a loan and would prefer it to be shorter term.

solar,Recommendations for excess energy,"So I built out my solar last year and it's been up and running for two months. I massively overproduce. Currently using 40% of production. When I built out the system I built it out the way I did because of several reasons:

* I was planning to buy an electric car and wanted to be able to charge it.
* I live alone in a three bedroom house currently and know energy needs will increase if/when I live with someone or if I ever sell the house.
* I read in a lot of places that it's more expensive to add panels than to get them added initially and so it's better to have an extra panel or two than to need to add them later.

I think everyone underestimated how much sun my roof gets here in Utah. We don't get a lot of cloudy days and so even in December and January it was amazing how much extra I produced. I do have a battery so I use very little grid feed and my battery easily charges in the morning. I also know that a) in the summer I'll be using the AC which will use more power and b) I'll be using more grid power if I run the AC at night since that can't run off the battery. I'll have my electric car next week but I work from home so I don't anticipate needing as much energy as I thought charging it.

So right now I'm feeding a ton of energy back to the grid and while we have net metering, they only give you credit and it's only 60% of what it costs to buy it back. I prefer to just break even and not give them much more but that's not how it's looking currently.

Any ideas on how I can use the excess energy? Besides trying to buy a computer and mining crypto I can't really think of anything. Or is this just one of those ""it's a good problem to have"" and I should stop worrying about it situations?

Edit with more info: For January I produced 645kWh. My consumption was 285kWh. I fed 330kWh to the grid and purchased 35kWh. I have an 18 panel 6.85kWh setup with a 10kWh battery for storage. I will be taking delivery of an Ioniq 5 with a 77kWH battery next week, but I work from home so I don't drive a lot.

personalfinance,Forbearance no-doc loan modification terms vs full-doc,"I started forbearance in July 2020 and continued extending it for as long as was allowed (18 months I think?).

So the loan modification expired. lll

Now they put me into a ""streamlined modification"", where no documentation is necessary. I've been offered a trial period with an interest rate the same as my original 15 loan (with 8 years remaining). Comparison of the original loan terms with the new offer:

Current Terms:

Modification Terms:  
$733/mo payment, 3.125%, 480 month term, maturity date May 2062

My questions:  
1. Do no-documentation streamlined modifications typically have worse terms than full-doc modifications? I think I may still have an opportunity to do a full-doc modification, but if the result is essentially the same, I'm thinking ""why waste the time?"".

2. I was really hoping to have the mortgage paid off in 8 years. If I accept these new terms, but continue to pay the original amount of $1369/mo (with extra payments to principle), would the loan be paid off in 8-10 years (8.5 years remaining, plus 18 months of missed payments during forbearance)?

I live in the UK and recently found out about a junior ISA that my parents opened for me many years ago. I was given two letters with information about the account, one is in my name and the other, which shows the account's balance, is in my mother's name. 

I have had an offer accepted on a property and want to use the money in this account to go towards my deposit. So, unfamiliar with this type of account, I called the bank's customer service line to ask if I could get the account solely in my name and how I would go about withdrawing anything from it. I had to answer security questions (my name and date of birth) and I failed them (lol) so they refused to speak to me. I assumed the person on the phone was expecting my mother's DOB, so I decided to try in-store instead. I went on Friday, armed with my passport. The lady behind the counter told me that when I turn 18, I will receive a letter to apply for an adult ISA in my name and the balance will automatically be transferred over. I told the lady that I'd only recently learned of the account but also, I am 24, so technically this should've been done already. 

When she checked the system, it showed my DOB had been entered as 2012 (making me appear as a very haggered 9 year old lol), meaning I have been incorrectly receiving the junior ISA interest rate for over 6 years. It also explains why my parents had not told me about any letter informing me I needed to open an adult ISA with the bank and why I failed the bank's security questions. How is something like this even possible in this day and age? Surely a form of ID must need to be validated before the account can be opened. I can only personally put it down to human error at the bank. 

I have been asked to return on Monday to discuss what will happen to the account. My parents claim the bank should honor the rate given as it is their mistake, but I'm worried they won't and there's some kind of rule in place for when/if this occurs. I've tried searching online but I'm not very good with banking terminology and I don't want to go to the bank unprepared. 

In essence I'm asking: can the bank try and take money away from the account? As mentioned, I want this money to go towards my property deposit, without it I'm kind of screwed.

Given with how crazy mortgage rates are moving right now, I decided I'd shop around and see if I could find someone who could do a 6 month rate lock. I settled on the following...  


3.875% interest 0 points 0 origination fee  
760+ credit rating  
Home purchase price of $484,900 with and 0% down (VA loan)  
$1200 in Lender Credit  
Rate lock for 6 months out until August 10, 2022. 

The interest rate I locked in now, compared to back in December, isn't great, but its still under 4.0% with no points. (Still historic lows in the grand scheme of things) There was no upfront fee to lock this rate in which I thought was a lucky find. I still want to shop around for rates as I get closer to closing to see if there is anything better for VA loans, but I feel a lot safer having this interest rate locked in as a backup in case VA rates are higher come May or so.   


So main question is, do you think I might be able to further shop around for better rates as far as a 6 month rate lock? Do you think VA rates will rise from here until early May? Would they rise over what I locked in now? Rising rates is what is freaking me out right now. With the year-over-year inflation at 7.5%, the 10 year treasury yield peaking over 2.0% in the last few days, and upcoming fed rate hikes, I am certain rates will be FAR worse than what I locked in now come May. I want to say I feel happy with this (and I do) but I guess I hate that I missed out on SUPER low interest rates by a few months.",finance,1644706545.0
personalfinance,Student Loan or Car Loan first?,"Finish paying off all my credit card debt, and no longer have that burden on me. 

I got a new job that’s going to pay me 20% more than my current job and I’ll be having to move back in with my mom since the new job is in my rural home town. 

I’ll be helping my mom out with expenses but my monthly rent with her will be around $200 a month. My take home pay would be around $5000. 

I was interested in buying a house but given the current market there is no way I would compete with over bid offers.

Given this information I was wondering if I should focus a big ton of my income into paying off my car debt or my student loan debt? 

I feel I should focus more on the student loans debt since the interest rate is suspended and would just be the pure balance at the moment till may.

CryptoCurrency,How Crypto solves asset forfeiture,"Asset Forfeiture is defined by ""Depriving criminals of the proceeds of their crimes and is a form of confiscation of assets by the authorities""

&amp;#x200B;

this usually takes place in the United States as way of punishing and deterring ""criminal activity"" by depriving ""criminals"" of property used in or acquired through ""illegal activities""

&amp;#x200B;

while I don't condone the use of illegal activities there are some instances where you could have your money seized without ever committing a crime and that is why having your money in crypto would come in handy

&amp;#x200B;

i would like to refer you to the case of  Stephen Lara a former United States Marine Corps veteran who had nearly  [$87,000 in cash seized](https://www.stripes.com/veterans/2021-09-01/former-us-marine-pulled-over-police-seize-thousands-cash-2740777.html) by Nevada Highway Patrol on February 19th 2021. he was not arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any crime. he wasn't even ticketed for an offense. The reason he was stopped was because ""highway interdiction"" he was asked if he had large amounts of currency in the car (over $10,000) and he was truthful telling the officer that

&amp;#x200B;

""yes i have a lot of money because i don't trust banks so i keep my own money"" Mr. Lara also had bank statements from his work proving that money was all acquired through legal hardworking  means. the sniffer dogs were called out to examine the currency and the dog was alerted to drug residue on the money even though [90% of all U.S currency has drug residue on it](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/cocaine-on-money-drug-found-on-90-of-us-bills) all of his money was seized as a result and a lengthy court battle ensued as a result trying to get his money back even though he committed no crime.

&amp;#x200B;

having his money in cryptocurrency would've been great in this situation because there wouldn't have been any  probable cause to have his whole life savings seized as a result. He would've been on his way to his daughters house with his life savings secured then could have cashed that out without going through a legal battle to prove that money was his even though he had bank receipts proving it was his in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

i would also refer you to the case of  Jerry Johnson a Charlotte North Carolina trucking company owner who had nearly [$40,000 USD in cash seized by airport security](https://www.fox46.com/news/local-news/exclusive-charlotte-trucking-company-owner-fights-to-get-40k-seized-at-airport-back/)  Mr. Johnson was flying domestically within the United States to go purchase a third tractor trailer for his small trucking company he was taken to a back office where he was interrogated for over an hour (like a criminal) because they didn't believe the money was his so it was seized. they told him if he didn't sign this paper he would be arrested, he complied then was free to go without his money.

&amp;#x200B;

he then had to prove to the state that his money they seized was in fact his his money. Mr. Johnson and his lawyer had a lot of evidence showing that it was in fact his money. He had receipts from his trucking company, bank statements, and loans from his family's members.  Mr. Johnson lost the case when the judge ruled that 'Mr. Johnson was not the owner of the money because Mr. Johnson could not prove that the cash wasn't connected to any crime.'

&amp;#x200B;

the burden of proof falls onto the victim of asset forfeiture to prove that the money is theirs and not tied to 'illegal activity' which contradicts the 'innocent until proven guilty' mindset that all of us has been fooled into believing.

&amp;#x200B;

now maybe your thinking these two cases are just unusual circumstances but the sad fact is that this happens to more people a year then you would think. Cryptocurrency would greatly reduce the number of these wrongly seized asset per year if more people would keep there money in crypto's when traveling abroad or domestically.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Cryptocurrency isn't able to be seized (as easily) by law enforcement without a number of factors such as having your seedphrase, access to your email, access to your google authenticator etc etc. This is the power of Decentralized banking where you are the sole owner.

# General Conclusion

Ampleforth is very interesting because it could definitely become a global base currency moving forward. Instead of USD, imagine a currency that is used by everyone in the world to trade. Instead of having the world currency (USD) being tied to the internal politics of US, this new currency is neutral and changes its monetary supply based on the global demand of money.In this episode, we will uncover the design of Ampleforth works, the economic considerations and how it plays a role in the DeFi space.

# 1. What is Ampleforth (AMPL)

* Ampleforth wants to be a token with a stable value.
* **How?** They do this with an automated governance using code, by internalising the price volatility in the secondary market.
* **Explain more?** The code is 2 math functions. (1) It calculates the price difference between the ""ideal price"" USD$1 and the actual exchange rate now (e.g. US$1.15). Then it mints more tokens, so that the price goes back down to US$1. (2) It doesn't do this suddenly, token changes happen over a period of 10 days. We call this supply smoothing.
* **So what's cool about it?** It can be used as collaterals in the DeFi projects. It's also not strictly pegged to a fiat currency (e.g. DAI with USD), so it makes it more independent and useful in the long run. Basically, Ampleforth is the new global currency without central bank.
* **Can I earn money with AMPL?** It is possible. For example, doing arbitrage trading with price differences, because you know that prices will always go back to US$1.

# 2. AMPL vs AAVE, COMP, USD

* You can't compare AMPL with AAVE or COMP.  
* because they have different token functions.
* AMPL has a money function and AAVE or COMP has a utility function. It's like comparing USD with American Airlines miles system. It's similar, but not the same.
* But you **can** compare AMPL with USD.  
* because they both have money functions.
* AMPL has an independent monetary policy while USD clearly does not.
* USD is governed by the central bank (aka FED). It's a bunch of smart people in a room, deciding how much money should be available in the economy, the interest rates, the lending rates, etc.
* AMPL is governed by code instead.
* **Is that good or bad?** It really depends. It's good because economists are always looking for solutions to get an independent neutral money, used by everyone. We call this the Triffin Dilemma. However, because it is **only** governed by code, it's possible to affect the secondary market in a short period, if you have enough tokens to manipulate the code.

# 3. Economics Design of Ampleforth

* **Market Design** 
* To increase network effects and demand for AMPL, there are 2 systems in place  
* increase the use of AMPL as collaterals for DeFi projects
* use of Geyser program for people to stake their tokens
* To reduce insane fluctuation in prices, a supply smoothing function is applied, so the change in token quantity is done over a period of 10 days.
* To become more politically independent and to tap onto the benefits of a digital network, the information (prices, volatility, decision making) is done by oracles and machines.
* **Mechanism Design** 
* Math is used to define the rules of the game, for the system to abide by
* When prices change, it affects the amount of tokens available. This directly affects the number of tokens you have in your wallet.  
* **Get smart:** this is where most people don't understand the system. They think that AMPL is a scam. Because tokens can be removed. See below (5. Valuation of Ampleforth) for further explanation.
* Oracles are used to take in prices (via exchange rates of AMPL) and internalise that information.  
* **How**? It changes the amount of of AMPL supply, in response to the prices.
* If prices are too high: print more AMPL
* If prices are too low: burn some AMPL
* **Token Design** 
* Instead of [chartallist](https://youtu.be/1suLcHUHcDU) money like USD, AMPL is metallist money (aka commodity money, like gold). But we call it synthetic or digital metallist money.  
* Machines (math mentioned in #3) define the monetary policy
* Uses Countercyclical approach (see points above on when it prints or burns AMPL)
* Reduce economic fluctuations (see mechanism design above, on internalising price differences and changing supply, so value of 1 AMPL is about US$1)
* AMPL's value is allowed to fluctuate between ±5% of US$1\*  
* this US$1 is pegged to the economic definition of ""Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the 2019 dollar""
* Supply smooth is used so that we prevent supply side inflation (or shocks). So if there is an increase in tokens by 15%, the increase will happen over 10 days. Each day will increase by 1.5% instead.
* It's also interesting because it has low correlation to Crypto-assets price fluctuations.  
* **Get smart**: this is great for being part of the portfolio
* Big VCs own a significant percentage of AMPL tokens that is vest  
* **Get smart**: this can be dangerous when the vesting period is over and they dump it in the market

# 4. Monetary Policy

There are 3 situations in the monetary policy:

&gt;Graphs and explanations are in the video.

* expansionary  
* Prices will remain the same in the long-run
* But supply will increase
* Market cap will increase in the long-run
* contractionary

* Market cap will decrease in the long-run

personalfinance,Are we being too frugal with our house budget?,"Throwaway account.

I feel a bit overwhelmed today with the housing market in our area, the rising interest rates, and the general state of the world.

My wife and I (both mid 30s, no kids) have been debating buying a house in our HCOL city for a couple of years but every time we get close to committing to it we stop and continue renting because of a fear that we’re going to overextend ourselves financially. For some context, we both grew up relatively underprivileged so we have always looked at money a bit differently and try to live well below our means. A few years ago, we were actually under contract on a house in our current area but backed out for similar fears even though looking back we should have committed to it since the mortgage was basically what we pay in rent now. We owned a home in a different part of the country about 8 years ago that we purchased for $250k and sold in 2017. For us at that time we had similar fears but the cost to us was more in line with what we thought the house should cost, and if that house value dipped in the market we’d still be ok. In our current area, a 4br, 2000 sq foot house in a decent area is going for $650k-$700k or more. And for transparency, I go to therapy to deal with some of my reservations around spending money related to my childhood.

The stats:

* Combined income of $230k, up to $260k with both of our bonuses factored in. I’m in tech and she’s in sales.

* Combined retirement savings (401k and brokerage accts) of $300k

* Current cash savings of $200k in a high yield savings account

* We max retirement accounts and save $4000-$4500 per month after taxes ($2000 to investment accounts in index funds that track the SP and $2500 to savings accounts). We rarely pull money out of the savings account, we actually have a second savings account with about $5k that we use for things like trips. 

* Current rent is $2400

* Total debts per month are $580. I have a $280 car loan at 0.9% that will be paid off in a couple of months and a $21k student loan at 5% that costs about $300 and will be paid off in 8 years.

* We both have mortgage credit scores around 800

* We’re looking at houses up to $625k, which would put our total PITI around $2800 depending on interest rates (currently around 4% with an 800 credit score and no points)

So the question I have is, are we being too frugal with our house search? If we’re saving $4000 per month in cash and taking care of our retirement goals, it shouldn’t seem too far fetched to take some of that and use it to buy the house we want even if that mortgage comes to $3200 or so. But, that number scares me after seeing what happened in 2008. My parent’s house value was completely wiped out in 2008 and that caused some issues, so it makes me hesitant to even consider buying an expensive house. The other part of the issue is taking a large chunk of that $200k and using it for our down payment. For example, 20% of a 750k house is $150k without factoring in closing costs. That $200k number helps with my financial insecurity, but I know it’s losing money everyday just sitting in a savings account.

personalfinance,A Teacher's Question about W4 Withholding and using the IRS Tax Estimator,"I am currently using the  Tax Withholding Estimator on [irs.gov](https://irs.gov) to best determine my tax liability for 2022. I want to get as close to zero as possible on my 2022 return.

As a teacher, I receive a pay increase every September.  There's a 2021-2022 salary scale on the district's website to which I can best estimate how much I will be making in September.  But I won't know the precise amount of the raise until the 2022-2023 salary scale is released over the summer. In between now and then, the union typically negotiates a bit extra.

I am planning on updating my W4 with HR for 2022, and I am trying to use the given Estimator tool to best determine how much I should have withheld from my check.  Given my situation, which would be the best approach.

1. Calculate the gross for paychecks from January to August, then estimate the gross for paychecks from September to December, then get the sum of the two grosses.
2. Set the Withholding Estimator to ""planning to leave this job"" and set the leave date to 08/31/2022.  Then in September, update the W4 with the current paystub information.
3. List the current gross income, and then estimate how much more in gross income I will receive from September to December. Include the difference in salary as a ""bonus amount"" and check off  ""My spouse’s or my employer will withhold the appropriate taxes from this bonus .""

What I am most curious about is that if I go with option #1, the ""federal taxes paid per pay period"" and ""gross wages per pay period"" are obviously going to differ between now and September. Therefore, will it offset my calculations if I choose that route?

Also, there is a chance I might switch jobs/school districts altogether between now and September. In that case, I would be paid out my gross until the end of August.  As always, there's no crystal ball, but I am just leaving that option open in case something else comes along that I want to jump on.

One more thing to note is that once I find out precisely how much of a raise I will be receiving, I plan to increase my 457b contributions. So most likely I would need to update my withholdings anyway come September.

Finally, if you feel that is a better tax estimator tool to use than the one provided by the IRS, please let me know.

Again, my tax refund for 2022 does not have to be precisely zero. I am just looking at getting the least amount of refund as possible without miscalculating and subsequently ending up having to pay the government when I file.",finance,1644713102.0
CryptoCurrency,Yotta Banking is Utilizing USDC to provide higher interest rates for its users!,"I switched to using Yotta as my main bank for savings several months ago, regardless of cryptocurrency adoption. But recently they unveiled a ""Cryptocurrency bucket"" which basically just means they will transfer your savings into USDC and use it to generate interest for you. They're promising up to 4% APY using this method. (Personally, I am highly skeptical this 4% figure will stick around, but getting at least 1.5% was possible before the crypto adoption, so I will be happy even if the rate slips a bit.)

I was very doubtful of this bank at first. It seemed they had a very high APY offering for a savings account. They offer 0.2% guaranteed APY, but the remaining amount comes from Yotta's own lottery system, in which you get a set number of tickets per week based on how much you have saved in your account. Typically, you would get 1 ticket for every $25 you had saved, but with the introduction of their cryptocurrency bucket, you receive a ticket for every $10 you have saved, effectively giving you 2.5x the interest from before. There are also a few ways to get bonus tickets, such as using direct deposit, recurring transfer, and if you convince someone to use the app you both get bonus tickets. Their app also lets you track the APY you're realizing, and I am personally on course to match the numbers they are advertising.

I thought it was cool that a bank was using cryptocurrency instead of trying to shut it down like most major banks! And I'm happily keeping 100% of my savings in this online savings account. (I have a separate checking account, but Yotta does provide credit services and a pretty cool debit card to go with it.)

I wanted to keep this post relatively short, so I won't go into all of the nitty-gritty details about their system, but I will happily answer any questions in the comments. In addition, you can look up details online or download the app. Fair warning, I THINK they are a USA-only bank due to their lottery system, so if you live elsewhere, sorry!

I am big into crypto, but I also recognize I need an emergency fund. So I am more than happy to find a way to generate some decent interest while still being exposed to crypto within my emergency fund.

More information here: https://www.withyotta.com/ or just search ""Yotta.""

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is about freedom,"As humans, we require somewhere to park the value of our efforts across space and time. This is the primary function of a tool called money.

Since 1971 (when the U.S. defaulted on its gold debt to other sovereign nations) and until 2009, people have been deprived of a sovereign store of value. We can run through the list together.

Gold and precious metals have been seized and manipulated countless times by governments and central banks.

Real estate is taxed and over the course of 30 years you will lose a majority of the purchasing power you invested into it. Not to mention the pain in the ass that it is. I just understand 1 house in your portfolio to live in. But aside from that it doesn't make sense to use real estate as a form of wealth protection.

Stocks are manipulated and controlled by Wall Street, Central Banks, and the government (look at the meme stock hype for evidence and the illegal naked shorting that resulted from it).

Bonds are return free risk (thank you Peter Schiff). When the return for a bond is 2% and inflation is 7.5%, then your real rate is -6.5% at best. And that's with massaged government inflation statistics.

Speaking of inflation, the idea that inflation is necessary to sustain an economy is propaganda at best and straight up theft at its worst. If you zoom at max on the S&amp;P 500, the chart looks eerily similar to the currency collapse of the Weimar Republic.

All of this leads me to Bitcoin. The completely sovereign, most secure computer network designed for one purpose alone; to defend your hard earned money from all the bullshit.

My student loans have a remaining balance of about 27k.  The min payment is about $200/mo, but I've been paying $500/mo for a couple years now.  I get my yearly bonus from work in a few weeks, which isn't much, but it should be about 4k net.  

If I throw that 4k at my student loans, the balance drops to 23k, which finally brings my student loan balance under my savings account balance.  

It's tempting to just pay them off and be done with them, but I look at the interest rate (something like 1.8%) and the fact that I've technically paid ahead by 2 years now, so if something bad came up, I wouldn't have a payment due until late 2024, and it's hard for me to justify wiping out my savings just to eliminate my student loans.

Dad's getting Social Security checks now and for him to qualify for Medicare, there can only be 1 car in the family. He hasn't fully paid off the car yet. Here are the auto loan details: 

* Loan Amount: Initial 18k+ / Current 15k

* Interest Rate: 5.14%

* Monthly Payment roughly $340

1.  Start the title transfer through the DMV. 
2.  Get the lender's approval? for the transfer. 
3.  Find and get car insurance.
4.  Refinance if possibble

Should I consider using Tally plus which would consolidate my loans from discover and capital one and combine my monthly payment(s) into one, saving me money for $300 annually

* Roll into another qualified retirement plan

The primary question: What kind of account(s) and/or investment(s) can I move these funds into that are considered low risk and avoid the lump sum cash out tax penalties?

For a long time I have been exploring and working on an idea for a trading bot that can be used as a plugin to a regular exchange/brokerage.

One of these developers said projects like these often get flagged by exchanges (which I understand, but also is not the current problem) and often times get you in trouble with the federal government. From all that I can dig up (and my GF who is in prelaw) is that if I am working on/using an algorythmic program I need to register myself as a securities trader with the SEC.

Buy personally I'm scared because I don't know if we can afford the rent + utilities + repairs but that's just me being paranoid because that's how I am.

Obviously we have no money out of our pocket to afford 40k in a down payment. But we have a family member that works at a mortgage company and he could help us to see if we get approved for a loan.

economy,Is capitalism a con?,"I read economics as part of my degree but it’s not my strongest point. However, at the surface level, people’s argument for capitalism is that if you worked harder you make more money.

However, I’m yet to see this in practice.

Instead it feels like, if you’re rich, it’s a great way to ring fence and increase your wealth while stopping everyone else achieving wealth.

Here is what I mean.

**Entrepreneurship**
Let’s say if you started a product business.
- imports taxed  
- hiring staff taxed
- building/office taxed
- profits taxed 
- wages taxed 

How the hell are you to make any money?

**Income**

- salary taxed 
- interest rates increased if salaries are increased

**investing**
- property investing taxed on purchase
- property taxed on sale
- property income taxed 
- other investments like shares are taxed.

From finance, the internet, to sports betting there has been significant transformation brought about by the adoption of the decentralized system of blockchain. The future is indeed DeFi.

 This is greatly illustrated in DeFi Microlending. To those unfamiliar with the term, it essentially means access to microloans by small entrepreneurs and SMEs on a blockchain ecosystem.
 In traditional microlending, the workflow is as thus, a microlending website collects funds from investors and funnels them to a borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. Essentially, access to loans is location sensitive. However, with DeFi microlending, borrowers from anywhere can access microlenders from anywhere. Once more, blockchain is highlighted in its transformational glory.

CryptoCurrency,NFTs are ruining crypto's reputation.,"NFTs are ruining crypto's reputation.

- Game developers such as UbiSoft are shoving NFTs down gamer's throats, and they hate it, gamers ridicule it saying it's the worst thing that ever happened to video games in recent history,

- Turns out Melania Trump sold her own NFT to herself to boost the price giving NFTs a bad rep,

- Majority of regular people when asked about NFTs say they are stupid, and most of them don't even understand what NFTs are, don't believe me? Ask your coworkers on Monday about what they think about NFTs,

- Even big YT channels such as Linus Tech Tips make fun of NTFs almost in every single episode of Tech Linked,
- General population is fed up with NFTs,

- Even South Park makes fun of NFTs. If you are in a South Park episode you should know you've messed up big time,

- People use NFTs to make a quick buck congesting the networks all the time increasing fees,

- Right now we have thousands of different NFT collections and 99% of them are a worthless pieces of crap.

Crypto space has become a laughing stock due to NFTs. It was cool and awesome when people were just buying cute meme coins for lols, but NFTs pushed it too hard and now people are fed up with them and start to hate them and start to hate the entire crypto space in general. 

The biggest enemy of crypto space is the crypto space.

Change my mind.

Edit: To clarify, the tech itself is great, but it should be used to verify medical records, house ownership, verifying votes, verifying IDs etc. but not for selling pictures of rocks. It just makes crypto space looks childish and nobody will take us seriously until a real-world use case can be provided.",cryptocurrency,1644763192.0

personalfinance,Bad idea to buy house with a 20-yr fixed mortgage if I plan to refi to 30-yr fixed in a few year?,"I’m exploring my options around buying a house for the first time. My wife and I currently have no kids and a lot of room in our budget that could go towards housing costs. In ~5 years though, we’ll likely have 2 kids, and we’ll have a lot less to money to put towards housing each month because daycare in our HCOL city is like $2,000/month per child.

With that in mind, I’m trying to figure out how best to take advantage of having a lot to spend now, but less in a few years. One option that I’m exploring is to buy a house now with a 20-yr fixed rate mortgage, but then refinance when the second kid comes (guessing maybe 4 years from now) to a 30-yr fixed to lower our monthly payment.

Based on my calculations, this seems really promising: on a $900k loan with an interest rate of 3.25% on the 20-yr and 3.75% on the 30-yr, we are paying about $1000 per month “extra” (vs a normal 30 year) for the first 4 years, but after refinancing to a 30 year after 4 years, our payment would drop $1600, so our “net” payment/month is $600 lower than if we can just gone with a normal 30 year from the start. (part of the reason the monthly drops so much is because we pay off a good chunk of the principal during the first 4 years of the 15-yr mortgage)

My question for you all is, what am I missing? What are the downsides? The two main things I have in mind is that in this scenario there is a bit of risk in refinancing because rates could be up 4 years from now, so I might not be able to lower the monthly payment as much as I'm hoping. The other downside I’m thinking of is that the total number of years paying off mortgages goes up to 34 with this plan, so the total amount of interest we pay until the house is paid off would be a bit higher. Oh and one other thing: refinancing has fees associated with it (not sure how much though tbh).

What do you think? This looks pretty good to me… but is this actually a foolish plan?


A few concrete numbers (these are kinda hypothetical though, we aren’t under contract on a house or anything):

* Loan amount: $900,000
* Monthly payment on 15-yr 3.25% mortgage: $5,105
* Monthly payment on 30-yr 3.75% mortgage: $4,168
* Monthly payment on 30-yr 3.75% mortgage after having paid down the 15-yr mortgage for 4 years: $3,536",finance,1644765933.0

vet,cat straining to urinate/ not urinating at all,"edit: got him catheterized :) he's fine now 
I posted here a while back but my first vet was awful so I'm updating yall.. I took my cat (6 yrs old, male) to another vet because the first one claimed he had an ""unknown lump"" and insisted on an xray without even attempting to pinpoint the problem so we refused. this new vet confirmed that the lump is just his full bladder and he can't pee. he's lathargic because he refuses to eat with his urinary issue so that's why he's not pooping, and she gave us some supplements and liquid cat treats. she grabbed him and continously squeezed him to make him pee but said there was a blockage. he was not peeing at all even with the constant squeezing. she suggested we bring him to another vet for possible x ray and surgery because her clinic didn't have the machines so we took him to a 3rd vet and the 3rd one just said he's dehydrated, his bladder is fine, and gave us some UTI medicine and an antibiotic shot. I don't trust this 3rd vet at all. I do think there's a blockage that can only be solved with surgery. what do you think? can he possibly pee after 2ish days of not peeing and being constantly squeezed by the second vet with no results? the 3rd vet suggested saline water and this weird supplement called ""urinary tract gel for cats"" and I'm very very skeptical. I truly believe his life is on the line and it's not a matter of dehydration. I don't know I'm very scared and I live in a 3rd world country so each vet is 30 minutes away from each other and each one has a different explanation. the second vet said it might be kidney stones but wasn't sure so I researched it and he doesn't fit the criteria. there's no vominiting or blood in urine etc and the 3rd vet said he didn't feel any lumps. I'm so lost. he's gaining a bit of stamina since the 3rd vet force fed him cat treats to cure his lathargy but he still didnt piss. what do you suggest? can I give him a warm shower/ special diet to make him pee or what should i do..",cryptocurrency,1644767956.0
personalfinance,"My Paychecks Are Garnished, 2021 Tax Return?","I was self-employed for 2019-2020 tax years, and made some poor financial decisions in the latter half. I didn't pay my taxes, avoided the IRS, and never set up a payment plan.

personalfinance,Parents thinking about selling house - what can I do to jumpstart the process?,"I'm 22, and my parents are talking about selling our house while the market looks like it does. I am in complete agreement, and honestly want to get the ball rolling yesterday. However, it seems like they're either dragging their feet, or more likely, just don't feel the same urgency I do to get the house sold. There are still some things to do around the house (new carpets, re-grouting, fixing cabinets) and we haven't even made appointments to get those done yet. Even though I don't know anything about the current economic environment other than: high interest rates, high housing markets, as well as some Crypto basics, I do know this market won't last forever, especially with the interest rates so high.

So my question is, is there anything I can do to either help the processes get started (and what are those processes &amp; how would I go about accomplishing them), or is there anything I can tell/show them to get them working on it more?

I know that ultimately, I can't make them do this and that the motivation has to come from them. I think they want to wait until spring break, or maybe even the summer to get started. I just don’t have the confidence that the bubble won’t burst before then. So if there's any way I can even move them an inch further down the line, I think that'd go a long way.

CryptoCurrency,Blockchain and Cryptocurrency – A complete beginners guide,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, it’s written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But it’s not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many agues more secure because of it. Also, miner contend that, as an industry, it can actually help the power grid. They consume when demand is low, ensuring the power quotas are met, and are even willing to turn off machines to conserve energy when needed. Like was the case recently in Texas.

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IOG and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes run on minimal hardware .. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to become more energy efficient. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Its important to note that each chain has their own way of doing things.  
Some require you to lock up your stake.  
Others implement punishment controls, like slashing.  
Whatever options they choose; the choices are typical driven by how the founders believe they can best secure and scale the chain.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,929,200 BTC out there at a cost of 43,087.16.

That means, the market cap is 43,087.16 x 18,929,200 = 815,605,469,072 (815B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,526,814,681. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is 1.26 that means the market cap for Cardano is 1.26 X 33,526,814,681 = 42,243,786,498.06 (42B)

You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.

132,670,764,300 + ((10,000\*60\*24\*351) = 137,725,164,300 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)  
137,725,164,300 \* 1 = 137,725,164,300

You'll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594 \* 30 = 963,828,827,820

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.05 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?  
Who is their target audience for adoption?  
Who is funding them?  
Who is their team building it? What is their history?  
Do they have a good plan?

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. It’s much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.  
Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.  
Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.  
But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.  
When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.  
Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Also, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With coins like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

Lastly, as someone pointed out in a previous post, you should remember that you coin is really in neither the exchange nor your “wallet.” Your coin is in the blockchain.  
An Exchange and a “wallet” are really just User Interfaces to interact with the blockchain.

The main difference between your own wallet, and an exchange, is who owns the “private key.” Without going to deep into asymmetric key pairs, just know that your “key” allows you to access your coins. And just like the key to your house, you should keep it safe yourself, and not let just anyone hold onto it.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. The first was CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with. Ever..

**What are Oracles?**

The Oracle is a charter in the matrix that bakes cookies.  
No… not that Oracle..

Oracles, are trusted third parties that provide off chain information for on chain smart contracts.  
Basic smart contracts may not need oracles at all. They can simple execute based on a set of conditions. “Sell NFT to user if user buys NFT.”

But say for example you want to create a smart contract travel insurance.  
The contract could say, “If the weather in Bora Bora is bad on the day of travel, it will refund the travel and allow you to book at a later date.”

But how could the smart contract know what the weather is. Answer, Oracles.

…. There is no spoon

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.  
What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.  
Let us sit and think about that for a second.  
De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”  
Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.  
It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and never again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if it’s not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

**What is the metaverse?**

Hmm… well… no one really knows what this thing is or what it will be really.

The ones building it, and investing into it, seem to think it’s the start of Halliday OASIS in Ready Player one.

A place where you can “jack in” using virtual reality and walk around a virtual world. And inside this virtual world would be services that you can buy and utilize.

Shopping for new cloths? Head over to the Versace Mansion and virtually try somethings on. Then order and have an Amazon drone drop it off hours later.

Getting hungry after all that shopping, and spent too much already?  
Stop by for a quick byte at McDonalds, order, and have doordash drop it off.

Or maybe you want to have a virtual party house on a popular part of the map. Buy some virtual land!

At a technical level the metaverse is really an interface and the utilization of NFTs on a particular blockchain.

Take for example Decentraland. Its built on Ethereum.  
Or Blocktopia, which is built on Poloygon.

So its not really “one” metaverse, but really a collection of different applications creating virtual worlds in order to entice you to spend time, and eventually purchase good and services.

**What is a Dex?**

If you’re here, you’re likely familiar with what a Centralized Exchange is. Its something like Coinbase or Kracken. Essentially, they are off chain stores to buy and trade cryptocurrencies.

A Dex, is a Decentralized Exchange.  
It does the same thing of allowing users to buy and sell coins, but the code that makes the application function is all written with on chain smart contracts.

There are a couple key benefits of Dexs.  
The first is that many don’t require that cumbersome Know Your Customer (KYC) details. You can just link a wallet, send in some other crypto, and start trading for different tokens.  
The second is that many tokens aren’t listed on centralized exchanges, and can only be traded on a Dex.

Be careful though, because it doesn’t have KYC and has many new coins, they are havens for scammers.

**What is a Dapp?**

A true Dapp is a decentralized application. Decentralized because all the code is written to smart contracts that live on the chain, and thus on each node running the software distributed worldwide.

In practice, there are lots Centralized applications out that that still run “off chain” code, and hold valuable information server side, and then just write some things to the chain.

**What is DeFi?**

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a growing group of financial tools built on a blockchain. These tools are open for anyone to use; all you need is a wallet address and some Coin. These tools span a range of uses that let users trade crypto-tokens, take out a loan, cast a vote, and even sell art. Since these tools follow a set of standards, users can combine operations across different protocols. For example, you can build a chain of transactions where you borrow money, make a profitable trade, and repay the loan -- all instantaneously.

**What is a DAO?**

DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization. Simply put, DAOs are communities of people who share the same interests, work on the same projects or in similar industries, or hold the same beliefs. The company you work for, the public corporation you hold stock in — hell, even your church and the country you live in — could all be DAOs!

The difference between DAOs and these other organizations is that DAOs are built on a blockchain. Just as the Boy Scouts have handbooks, corporations and churches have governance laws, and countries have governments and constitutions, DAOs have smart contracts that are coded on the blockchain.

**Can you break down some of these Acronyms?**

**HODL** = is a term derived from a misspelling of ""hold,"" in the context of buying and holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's also commonly come to stand for ""hold on for dear life"" among crypto investors. The term HODL (or hodl) originated in 2013 with a post to the Bitcointalk forum.  
**Hopium** = Represents the belief that the situation will someday improve.  
**FOMO** = Fear of Missing Out  
**FUD** = Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt  
**Bear**/**Bearish** = ""Bears"" believe that an asset, for example a digital currency, will decline in value.  
**Bull**/**Bullish** = If a trader believes that an asset will rise in value, he or she is a ""bull.""  
**DYOR** = Do your own research

**What is a “Pump and Dump?”**

This is when a person, or likely group of people, buy up some low market cap coin, and then hype it, typically on social media, wait for the price to get to the target, and then sell everything they bought.

[https://www.foolproofme.org/articles/864-major-crypto-scams-explained-pump-and-dump-vs-rug-pull](https://www.foolproofme.org/articles/864-major-crypto-scams-explained-pump-and-dump-vs-rug-pull)

**What is a “Rug pull?”**

Similar to a pump and dump, the idea is to get the price up, then bail.

Unlike a pump and dump, a rug pull refers to those creating new coins, they hyping them, and then bailing. This happens just as much as pump and dumps, and can easily be avoided by ensuring you DYOR.

How do I avoid losing your coins, by mistake, or from being scammed?

Make sure you keep your seed phrases safe. If your computer crashes, or you lose your phone, you’ll have to recreate your wallet using your seed phrase. There are tons of stories out there about people losing access to their accounts. That’s really the double edge sword of cryptography, and currency tied to it, in its current state. The security is so good, that you can’t crack it. You can try to brute force it, and some have gotten lucky, but typically, if you lose your seed phrase, and access to your wallet, you’ve “burned” your coins.

Don’t watch youtube for cryptocurrency advise. I have channel, I try to put out educational content, and there are some that are ok, but for 99% of them, they are trying to use you to make money. Their whole business model for them to profit, is for you to do what they say. They pump you full of hopium, and then run off with your bags. Today, you need to really try to do as much research on your own as you can. Read lots of articles, from both perspectives, then make up your own mind.

Don’t talk to anyone that approaches you on social media about investing.

This goes back to “never talk to strangers.”  
Far to often scammers will reach out to you on Facebook or Instagram and start a friendly conversation. They could even appear to be a sexy female/male looking to just be friends… and the next thing you know they are telling you how much money they made in crypto… and all you have to do is send your 450K worth of ETH to this brand new DiFe liquidity pool. Next thing you know you can’t get access to your funds, and they are asking for an additional 50K. Which is exactly what happened to someone I consulted with recently.

**Do your own research (DYOR)**. There are now more then 4K types of cryptocurrencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of scam coins.

2. **Adam Back** – This guy invented **HashCash** back in 1997 and is the CEO of **Blockstream** today. Back was born in London, England, in July 1970. His first computer was a Sinclair ZX81. He taught himself Basic, and spent his time reverse engineering video games, finding decryption keys in software packages. He completed his A levels in advanced mathematics, physics and economics. He has a computer science PhD in distributed systems from the University of Exeter. He was only one of the first two people to receive emails from “Satoshi” and worked on **Bitcoin** in the early days.
3. **Nick Szabo** \- Nicholas ""Nick"" Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1989 with a degree in computer science and received a law degree from George Washington University Law School. He holds an honorary professorship at the Universidad Francisco Marroquín. The phrase and concept of ""**smart contracts**"" was developed by Szabo with the goal of bringing what he calls the ""highly evolved"" practices of contract law and practice to the design of electronic commerce protocols between strangers on the Internet.
4. **Vitalik Buterin** – Co-Founder of **Ethereum,** this man was only 19 when he first wrote his whitepaper. His concepts brought to life smart contracts for the first time. While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children and was drawn to mathematics, programming, and economics. Buterin then attended the Abelard School, a private high school in Toronto and learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at the age of 17. He also co-founding Bitcoin Magazine in 2011. Also know for his philanthropy.

6. **Charles Hoskinson** \- Founder of **Cardano** and co-founder of **Ethereum**. He attended Metropolitan State University of Denver and University of Colorado Boulder to study analytic number theory. In 2013 Hoskinson quit a consulting job to begin a project called the Bitcoin Education Project. Hoskinson joined the Ethereum founding team (one of eight original founders) with Vitalik Buterin in late 2013. Hoskinson was approached by former Ethereum colleague Jeremy Wood to form a new project called IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), an engineering and research company that builds cryptocurrencies and blockchains.
7. **Silvio Micali** \- Born October 13, 1954 is an Italian computer scientist, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the founder of **Algorand**. Micali's research centers on cryptography and information security. In 2007, Micali was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to modern cryptography, through the development of zero-knowledge protocols and the theory of pseudo-randomness. In 2012, he received the **Turing Award** for his work in cryptography.

personalfinance,40 y/o self-employed seeking retirement/investment advice on SEP vs solo 401k,"I just hit 40 and need to start planning for retirement. I am self employed with an LLC taxed as an S-corp. I just started making decent money a couple years ago and am trying to get all my ducks in a row. On paper I make about $90k. Not sure if I can use business capital to contribute or if it has to come from personal accounts. or maybe distributions.. So confusing.

Currently I have 0 investments, a small amount of cash and the ability to set aside approx $1500 - $3000 a month depending on lots of factors. Some months I have an extra $20k, others less than a grand.

I also just closed on a house (finally!) Wife and kid at home but wife doesn't work so it's all on me to not end up living in a trailer like my parents with a little social security check and nothing else.

Goals: Run my business until mid 60's and then hopefully sell it or who knows but I do want to fully retire at some point. Might be too late for me who knows.

I have an EXTREMELY hard time saving so I don't know if this will even work. I've tried twice in the past to start IRA's but both times I had to withdraw all the money after less than a year. Feeling kinda hopeless but maybe there is a way to get this going.

So... SEP or solo 401k?

Current accounts: Wells Fargo, Navy Federal, Wealthfront, Schwab and Vanguard retirement accounts. all at 0$.

Polkadot,Sign And Verify - A Neat Feature,"You may have noticed under the ""Developer"" tab there is an option for ""Sign and Verify"".   
This is a neat feature exposed in polkadot js that will allow you to sign a message with your wallet or verify messages from other wallets. That message can include a claim to prove that someone does indeed own a wallet/address or any message really. If they do hold the keys for that address, they should be able to provide you a signature for that message. For example, below is a claim/message with the timestamp I signed the message and the resulting signature.

You should then be able to go to the ""Sign and Verify"" tab then ""Verify Signature"", put in the claimer's address, the claim/message, and the signature.

So now more about his situation he is married to someone with whom he does not live with. It has been this way for a long time now he lives with a partner their intention is to eventually get married. He and the partner have 2 kids. He has 3 kids with his wife all over 18. He pays the wife $110 everyday which he said to me needs to stop something needs to be done about it. She does not work and has no intention too. She has $0 income and no assets. The property which is under the wife's name he does not live at again he lives with a partner. That property is worth roughly $950,000 according to value websites. He wants to sell it but doesn't know where to go from there. I think divorce is a good option, yet it would wipe out his already not enough retirement funds.

personalfinance,How badly will opening new credit cards hurt my Credit Score / upcoming Mortgage Rates?,"Hi PF, 

I'm about to move for a job, and I'd like open a new credit card or two to get their bonus offers and defray some of the moving expenses (i.e. $200 cash bonus for spending $2000 in first 90 days). Seems smart, especially bc I will qualify for those offers very quickly, given all the expenses of moving. I have no debt and always pay the cards off monthly, so financial discipline is not an issue.

However, I opened a few credit cards last year and noticed my credit score hasn't fully recovered (previously 810, now 790 taking the avg of the 3 credit bureaus). I also just signed a lease and will likely open a new bank account when I get out to the new location, which will probably ding my score further. 

Normally I wouldn't care, but I have a goal to buy my first property in the next 12 months. If the mortgage interest rates will be meaningfully hurt by  opening new credit accounts, then it's not worth the immediate $300-400.

So there are 2 components to my question:

1. How much opening a couple new cards might impact my score (I'd guess another 20-30 point drop)

2. If going from ~790 to whatever the new score is would hurt my mortgage rates

stocks,Determining Fair Value of the market (S&amp;P500) on a P/E basis,"I came across a podcast (The Compound on Youtube) where they were discussing market valuation, and Tony Dwyer had mentioned that if interest rates (on the 10Y Treasury) are between 1-3%, a P/E of 20x on the S&amp;P is fair. That would mean SPY at 440 is around 20x Forward P/E currently (estimates for earnings of 220 on the S&amp;P this year according to Yardeni Research)

If so, I presume a 3-5% interest rate would put the fair value of the S&amp;P anywhere between 15-19 x P/E.

Does this make sense to anyone else? If so, then we can presume the current dips/volatility are the market effectively repricing to a lower P/E given that interest rates are rising. 

Personally this helps me view things rationally, and gives me a better understanding of what's going on, rather than fear mongering of the next 50%+ crash.

Bitcoincash,Questions,"So, I'm a big fan of Monero for many reasons and overall I think cryptocurrency are nothing but cool tokens in an arcade game with little to none application 'outside' of that arcade.   


Bitcoin Cash has strived to be different and so far, well, it seems to be working. Just got wind that folks in St Kitts use and accept BCH virtually everywhere, to shops to grocery (prices are shown in BCH), even cabs and hospitals! Better yet, they are PAID in BCH... St Kitts being a country with no income tax, territorial tax, no capital gains tax and company operated outside no corporate tax. So you're quite literally seeing this applied properly and USED! Moreover, it would seem that other Caribbean islands are not messing about either and they're growing with their adoption (other ECD countries).   


BCH seems more developed in terms of payment processors and so forth as well and if you think Bitcoin is used as currency you're not really paying attention (something like 82% of people who have BTC don't do anything with it lol) and one final praise i'll give... there's 5 countries that offer citizenship by investment and St Kitts is one of them... I'm not sure the details but if some crypto geeks are doing the smart thing and 'cash'ing out, buying real assets and a passport being one of them (citizenship) then they are injecting more BCH into that economy to flow about (beats HODL'ing or whatever the hell is said).   


Ok, enough jerkin' about, as I said, I think cryptos are a bubble, a scam, an economic catastrophe, and unsustainable 'generally' and most will go away, unless they gain confidence (via utility). For the same efforts as BCH, i'm a huge fan of Monero (and more, in fact I only really appreciate XMR its just recently i've looked at Bitcoin Cash). The point being, these will have a propensity to stay and be adopted as long as confidence is attached to them and they have a direct purpose that is involving an economy (transfer of wealth which is only a product of goods and services, nothing more). BUT, having said that, How does Bitcoin Cash rectify the fact that it is transparent and therefore not only traceable (from wallet:wallet, transaction: transaction) but also non-fungible. In other words, each coin is not like the other and can be identified as so.   


Just wondering if there's any effort to get around this as we know the Feds have not only been watching, but the more successful this gets, the more they're gonna be coming for it.

personalfinance,Is a balance transfer the best way to pay down a credit card that you’re “chasing” the balance for because of interest?,"I have a credit card that is in good standing and I’ve consistently payed the minimum for each month. But I’m at the point where I’m just steadily chasing the amount due, essentially staying stagnant or increasing slightly due to the interest gained each month. I have an unrelated card for a different expense that doesn’t have an interest rate and I have since brought that balance down significantly quicker than my primary credit card. So I guess I’m rambling on to ask if something like a balance transfer, or any other suggestions, are the right move in this case?",finance,1644781959.0

personalfinance,Is getting a 10% raise possible?,"I work at a company with a pretty small pay increase between promotions. Its a good company to work for, the people are usually nice, but they definitely underpay others and bank on them not asking for much. A entry-level higher could start off making a $1 more an hour than a supervisor who's been there for years. 

I've worked here just shy of a year now, and I really feel I've gone above and beyond. I've completely rehauled all of our procedure documentation, became in charge of creating new procedures, worked graveyard shifts for months while also covering for the janitors who quit, made a revenue calculator for upper-managment when our systems went down, etc. I have a good track record of solving problems, always asking to help with extra work, and we have a high turnover rate and are understaffed so I know the budgets there for a higher raise. 

I recently got temporarily promoted to interim assistant manager, while the assistant manager is the interim manager. It came with a temporary raise of a $1. Though the title and experience will help me in the long run, I was planning on asking for a permanent raise of a $1.75 (about a 10% increase from what I make) through a requested performance review. 

Though it has only been just a couple days since the temporarily promotion, I'm thinking of emailing my boss today or tomorrow about setting up a meeting for an performance review and to discuss my worth to the company. Im on good terms with them, I just feel weird about getting this temporary raise and promotion so close to when I want to ask for a permanent increase. Do you have any advice?",finance,1644783301.0
CryptoMarkets,An SME's guide to microloans,"SME's have always struggled to get loans to fund their businesses.  This is why I find the concept of Microloans/Microlending is very impressive and even altruistic. Microlending is the act of granting small loans (microloans) to those in financial need. These loans are generally used by entrepreneurs with a business idea or SME’s who need extra cash to expand their business. They can range from $20 – $1000 and have extremely affordable interest rates (or in some cases no interest rate) and terms. The main goal of microlending is to help entrepreneurs who would otherwise be unable to borrow money to launch or expand their businesses, thereby reducing poverty in impoverished areas. 

Today’s microlending system involves a website like suku.world, investors, (a microlender that lends to borrowers in a particular location like a financial institution such as a small NGO or large commercial bank), and a borrower. Investors browse the microlending website for one or more people or ideas in which they may want to invest. The microlending website collects the funds and channels them to the borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. The borrower then invariably pays back the microloan with interest.


The most impressive feature of Microlending for me is the fact that micro-lending organizations also actively participate in the training of entrepreneurs on how to run successful businesses. This benefits both microlender and borrower because it improves the borrower’s intellect while also helping to ensure that the borrower will make enough profit to pay back their loan.",cryptocurrency,1644783666.0
personalfinance,Tax issues with/concerns about Ellevest roboadvisor,"Hi Everyone - I'm looking for some advice on challenges I'm having Ellevest, the roboadvisor I've been using for a few years. I had to make two emergency withdrawals from the IRA I have with them last year. I calculated my approximate federal and state tax penalty and had them take that amount out from the withdrawal and pre-pay the taxes. When I received my 1099 from them, I noticed they reported incorrect numbers on the amount I withdrew. I've tried every which way of recreating the math to see if this could be a calculation error on my end, and it's definitely not. I've tried contacting them for over 2 ½ weeks about it, and it's been ***crickets***. No one has answered a single one of my  emails, and the phone number they have online doesn't allow you to actually speak with a person. I've gotten so desperate I've commented on their Instagram posts asking for support to get in touch. Needless to say, I'm going to be moving my money elsewhere, but I'm at a loss about what to do with this tax situation.

They reported a higher amount taken out from my IRA than I actually withdrew, and I don't want to have to pay an additional penalty because of their administrative bungle, but I'm not sure what recourse I have here, besides continuing to email them and hope someone eventually checks their Support inbox. Is there some kind of entity I can report this to? Looking into reviews about Ellevest it seems like I'm not the first person who's experienced this kind of issue with them, and I find it frankly egregious that I've had to resort to Instagram comments in the hopes of getting a company who holds tens of thousands of my dollars to acknowledge my existence.

I added all of the donation details, finish the rest of the return and when I do the Smart Check I get this error on the form 1040 worksheet:

 *Charitable contribution has unacceptable value* 

I did not get this error last year.  Smart Check red highlights the $300 entry on the 1040 worksheet.  I double-check everything and can't find a problem so I google the error message.  **This is a known bug that's a year old.**

So I tried the workarounds suggested in that forum and none worked.  TT won't let you efile with the error.  I gave up on support after being on hold for 45 minutes.  I really didn't think they'd have a fix anyway.  So I had the choice of mailing in the return or deleting the deductions and overpaying my federal taxes by about $70.  I'm getting substantial federal and state refunds this year so I bit the bullet and filed without the deduction.

Bitcoin,Rome fell when they lost the ability to pay the soldiers.,"I'm sure I don't have to point out to anyone here the glaring parallels between the fall of Rome and what is currently happening to the United States. 

Just like Rome clipping coins to pay their obligations, the United States federal reserve clips our labor by lending money at negative real interest rates. Eventually the people catch on and lose faith in the currency. It happens without fail. With Rome, the straw that broke the camel's back was when the soldiers quit accepting the payment they were offered and Rome lost their defenses.

I often think about this and how it will shake out today. I imagine all of the government secrets that our fiat money pays to keep hushed. The hidden technologies. The cover ups. All the smoke and mirrors that keep the great deception alive and society running. 

Do any of you think about this? Does it worry you? Excite you? What do you think will happen when the tipping point is reached? Do you think I'm just crazy?

personalfinance,Questions about refinancing auto and home,"My SO has a complicated finance history that I'm helping unravel and tame.  They went from a score of around 540 to around 720 after following my advice and I'm incredibly proud of them for making it this far.

Now I've hit kind of a wall in terms of how to handle these next few hurdles.  They own a house and a car in another state which their immediate family uses.   Both were also purchased under my SO's name.  The car's interest rate is 8.5% and the house is sitting at 5%.  Our initial plan was to first refinance the car because they've been receiving offers for 2.5% rates since their credit score improved then to refinance the house in a year.  Would doing this make sense? Would they be allowed to refinance a car then refinance their home the following year or would they have difficulty securing a refinance loan?

Another dilemma is that we need to buy a second car.  We currently only have one car which they can't drive because it's a manual transmission car so I've been taking them to and from work.  How would we be able to refinance their car and purchase a new one?  Would we be able to refinance a car (under them), purchase a new car (under me), then refinance a home (under them)?  The only loan I have is my own home and the monthly mortgage is 38% of my monthly take home.  A new car payment would be 5-10% of my monthly take home.

investing,Please ELI5 on interest rates…,"…and why feds raising interest rates during these times will reduce inflation? I understand trying to stem demand side of things, reducing borrowing and consumer spending, but isn’t it also disincentivizing business borrowing and suppressing labor growth and production as well? Especially in times of supply side constraints.

Granted, it’s truly a complex situation but are fed interest rate adjustments also more of a placebo effect on inflation? 

Many businesses that are affected by costs and supply are truly forced to raise prices, but there are businesses that are not affected and they’re raising prices anyway to capitalize on the current environment (companies are reporting record growth and profits). In short, everyone raises prices, wages rise, costs are passed on to consumers…repeat…a vicious cycle. Thus, “medicine” is needed to stem inflation, even if it’s a placebo?",finance,1644801400.0

solar,Tesla Solar System In Las Vegas,"I just bought a house here in Vegas back in July so I have not lived here an entire year, and the previous owner had a very different power consumption profile vs me. He was a Las Vegas native and kept the house at 84 degrees, and worked from an office outside of the home. I keep the house at 76 degrees and work from home (6 monitors, high powered PC, etc..). This house is also large, about 6k sqft with 4 AC units. 

Anyway, my peak monthly consumption was about  3,950 kWh according to NV energy last year; however this winter I've been averaging about 2,300 kWh according to NV Energy.   


I have the money to buy a system cash, the Tesla solar website quoted me a 19.20 kW Solar Panels at $38,558, two Powerwalls $17k for a total cash price of $55,588 + Federal Tax Credit of $14,063. So this is about a $40k system after incentives. My bill ranges between $290 - $400 / month. So let's say on average I pay $320/month that puts me at about 10 years before the system pays for itself. 

If I get one powerwall vs two it drops the price $7k. Ultimately my question is:

\- Are there better options out there for people who live in Vegas?  
\- Is a single powerwall enough? 

I guess I'm the only one who can answer if a 10 year investment is worth it or if I'm better off just dumping this money into the stock market, but I'm open to hear people's opinions or help educate me more on important info about solar I'm missing.",energy,1644813777.0

So far, I fully funded my Roth IRA and my wife’s as well. I put enough into my 401k to max it out each year. I’ve also paid off my car(about 11k). 

I’m going to put a decent chunk of it to our emergency and fun money accounts, and maybe do some work on the house, like maybe a new roof. That would cover us for emergencies and give us fun money for vacations and such.

However even with all of that we are looking at a shit ton of cash that I want to have working for me.

The only debt we have left is our home and our student loans. We could come close to paying the house off,  but it would eat most of the money away. The interest rate on the house is super low, so it’s not a high priority.

We owe around 80k for student loans. The student loan interest is ridiculous. But with payments on pause through May and talk of forgiveness I don’t know if I should just pay them off just to get it over with, or hold off a bit and see what happens.

So I’m still at a loss on what to do with the rest… I’ve never had this much cash money at once. I was a about 10 years late getting started on retirement, and my net worth is around $775k. I’m 42.

gaming,Game theme and name ideas to update home brew deck building dnd game thing,"This is an old home brew game I called ""Pillow Guardians"" which doesn't really roll off the tongue and was only a place holder so I could have a save folder. I am revising the game after half my files were eaten by my old laptop so this is a good time to revise the flavor/theme. New audience will be college students from a board game club on a saturday.

The old theme was a party of stuffed animal toys in a child's dream who were defending it from nightmare monsters.

I just ran with the picture below because I have the tact of a dead fish:
https://pin.it/1mWf6vP

TLDR; spark notes of the game and the characters that can be played

Players each had a random deck of character specific spells they would trade and build between battles and would play them in a hearthstone energy way while also being able to spend the same energy on moving and buying Tetris-like blocks to build walls against random monsters with a random deck of actions. Players would take turns against the monsters until the monster or player hit points were reduced to zero.

The extra campaign part was a dungeon crawler with terrain and event cards. players would explore to the end of the map, battle, defeat the boss, win the game.

The most interesting part of this game had to be the blocks where players could add them anywhere  and move horizontally/vertically on them. A game can develope from an empty board into a decorated inverted battle with a player building an emergency fortress and another lighting a quarter of the field on fire.

Main change is going from press fit blocks to magnetic and keeping things open to balancing.

The toys:

Ser Teddy: Tank, armor support caster, short range, slow, high damage dealer.

Wizard Penguin: spell caster, extra spells to help build, freezes everyone and creates ice markers for players to slide on

Candle Hat Dragon: spell caster, increases other players damage, deals damage over time, and leaves fire markers dealing damage to anyone that passes over them

Bishop Budgie: healer and pseudo tank. pushes/pulls players, monsters, blocks around the field

Reaper Cat: deals damage and heals itself. Jack of all trades

Thunder Unicorn: flip a coin and a spell can do a lot of damage to a monster or yourself. Also teleports.

Tinker Mouse: summons minions to fight and extra building spells

Garden Bunny: nimble archer with multi attacks and armor/block piercing attacks

And about a dozen other characters with place holder flavors.

Yeehaw Hare, Interstellar Octopus, Shogun Shrew, Good Boy Chief, Doom Turtle, Roller skate Cheetah, Flowy Tanglevine, Orchestral Orca, Dessert Chimp, Magician Lion, and Tiger

I could just pull the weird names and go generic knight, archer, ice wizard, etc or adapt it to be sci fi like a matrix or something. Might be best to go generic and let players create their own characters within the mechanics of a deck. No idea what to do for a name for the game.

CryptoCurrency,Rising interest rates helping crypto?,"We've all seen inflation hitting new 40 year highs and everything is getting out of hand, while the United States still think printing non stop is THE WAY to get out of the crisis.

        To stop people from spending that much, they increased slightly the interest rates on loans so people won't have that much money to spend, hoping to fix inflation.

         In the past, during times like these, a correction followed and we've seen most assets drop significantly, BUT since the crypto market is new, and hasn't yet seen a phase like this in it's current form, we don't know what to expect. 
In my humble opinion, the crypto market will crash with the stock market since we've already seen the correlation between the two.

         What is your opinion? Should crypto investors be worried? Tell me in the comments since I'm genuinely curios how others see the current situation.",cryptocurrency,1644835257.0

For the financial information, models, and ratios use, these were pulled from [here](https://www.financialstockdata.com/). These differ sometimes a bit per site. 

1. **Business Model:**

The company offers a range of stock exchange and business services, including securities quotations, cash and derivatives trading, and the dissemination of market data. It is simply an exchange, but it also provides services to other exchanges such as software maintenance, software licensing, and trading software in the form of managed services.

Euronext has several subsidiaries within Europe that they manage. However, they also have subsidiaries in Malta, India, United States. They buy up other exchanges and grow this way. Because they have already built a good infrastructure for the exchanges they have bought, they can run the bought exchange cheaper (cost reduction through economy of scale). Their revenue is divided among the following segments:

* *Listing (15,4%)*
* *Trading Revenue (37%)*
* *Investor Services (0.8%)*
* *Advanced Data Services (14.7%)*
* *Post-Trade (26%)*
* *Euronext Technology Solutions &amp; Other (6.2%)*

Definition Stalwarts:

A large, well-established company that still offers long-term growth potential.

3. **Financial Position/ Profitability**

ROIC 7 % (dalende trend)i , Net Profit Margin (+- 30% over 5 jaar),

D/E: Around 1.5 with ROE of 30/25%, Current Ratio (1.05), Quick Ratio (1.05). Considering the number of acquisitions they make, their debt and liabilities are not bad. Fine balance sheet in general.

4. **Management**

* **Outstanding Shares**

Outstanding shares have been increasing with the LSEG (London Stock Exchange) aquisition from 76 to 92 million shares. They have not announced a buyback program and so they diluted shareholders. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Compensation (CEO)**

The CEO's salary has increased in relation to earnings. Except in 2019 when it increases while earnings decline. Furthermore, in relative terms, salary rises slightly faster than company earnings.

* **Dividend**

At the time of writing the company has a Dividend Yield of 1.7%, a payout ratio of \~30% ( differs per site a bit, did not manually calculate it). It has not risen continuously they have lowered it in 2018.

5. **Moat: Competitive advantage**

*Efficient Scale/Scale Economics*

The moat that Euronext has is the Efficient Scale/Scale Economics. They have a large infrastructure and distribution network with which they reduce costs when they take over an exchange. And new exchanges in a country are not really set up.

6. **Intrinsic Value**

**Macro Economische Factoren**

With the low-interest rates, **Euronext** is currently benefiting from the fact that more ""savers"" will try their luck on the stock market. This means more trades in the shares and that, of course, results in higher turnover for the ""Trading Revenue"" segment. If ECB were to raise interest rates, this could of course result in fewer trades and thus less trading volume. At the time of writing, 47 percent of their revenue is dependent on trading volume. A market correction or crash is part of the bear case when you look at that.

**Discounted EPS**

I have determined an EPS-based intrinsic value on the organic growth that the company expects so without acquisitions. This is to get an idea, market conditions are clearly one of the risk factors of the company. I always use a discount rate of 10 percent, here I used a growth rate of 4 percent, and a terminal value of 12. The value then comes down to 58 euros, while the share is priced at 82 euros. With this value, there is currently no Margin of Safety. Also given the market conditions now, keep in mind that this is a conservative valuation as it is only based on organic growth. I think it is a very interesting company and I will certainly put it on my watchlist, but for the moment I do not see a Margin of Safety in it.

In the event of a market correction or crash, this could certainly be a real bargain for me if the market reacts even more to the then-prevailing fall in volume-based sales and profits (IPOs are also almost non-existent then, of course).

**Do not forget with DCF's you have a lot of freedom** in what you choose, that is why they can differ a lot and that is why I always do it conservatively, it gives you an idea what you should pay for a company or when it is a bit too much and that is great. But the number is not exact. You can see it more as eyeballing and it depends on how well you know the company how much growth you think you can put in.

CryptoCurrency,"The ""too hard"" pile","tl;dr: if you know about the ""too hard pile"", you don't need to read further. If you did not know, you need to acquire a habit of reading more.

Sometimes, the best decision that you may do with respect to an investment is considering it is ""too hard"", passing on it, and embracing JOMO. From _""Charlie Munger: The Complete Investor""_:

&gt; As a review, risk is the possibility of suffering a loss (not price volatility). The way Berkshire deals with risk is by buying what they feel is a conservatively valued asset with no risk at a discount price. Their focus is on having protection against mistakes that they may make during that process. What they do not do is increase the interest rate used in the computation to deal with risks inherent in the business. If there are significant risks inherent in the business itself, they put the decision in the too hard pile and move on to other potential opportunities.

Knowing when something falls beyond one's competence might as well considered a superpower these days, but it is a fundamental skill for investing.

We have seen children and animals randomly picking great options in rallies. That is easy when everything is going up, but every rally ends, and ""only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."" -- Warren Buffet.

Consider this your reminder to do some self-assessment about your circle of competence, what you got in it, and what is outside. After that, two good things to do are:

1. Read about technology, economy, etc. and expand your circle of competence.
1. Restrict your portfolio to your circle of competence and the things you understand.

Or alternatively enjoy the gambling knowing that:

1. You are swimming naked, nothing wrong with that.
1. You are not investing but eventually paying for the people that are doing their job as investors (the other two points), possibly along with some Ponzi schemes and other scams, because there is no shortage of them.

I also know that Ripple has responded to the SEC’s motion to strike the “fair notice defense.”

Is there an actual date on when Judge Torres will speak about Ripple’s response to the strike? Or about “fair notice” in general?

[It's just money; it's made up.](https://preview.redd.it/wbjkg5e3fth81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1be65440a12f570e4ec5bf418c7827c104edca9c)

All forms of money are a [shared illusion](https://www.theonion.com/u-s-economy-grinds-to-halt-as-nation-realizes-money-ju-1819571322). Fiat money can be burnt to provide some energy, but that would be a ""waste of money"". At the same time, fiat moneys are really just numbers on pieces of paper, or in computers. Gold is shiny, but largely useless.

What gives fiat, gold and crypto value is that others believe it has value. If we think of money as a product, it's a product with high resalability. We know we can buy the product today, and sell it tomorrow at roughly the same ""price"".

# Gold

Let's start with gold. It's one of the oldest forms of money. Before gold was used, cows, seashells, lead ingots and even weapons were used as money. All of these had downsides, being hard to divide up, easy to create more of, not durable, etc etc.

Gold fixed many of these issues. While at the time not having much value aside from being shiny, it has scarcity. It’s difficult to find more gold. It's durable. It can be divided into smaller units. It was, in short, the best option available to store and thus exchange value in.

Gold was in use in Egypt in 1500 BC, and gold coins were being minted in Lydia in 600 BC. The Romans used gold coins (Aureus &amp; Solidus), the Florentines had the Florin. Gold has a very long history of being used as money, longer than anything else. Yet we don’t use gold or gold coins as money anymore. What broke the illusion?

For all gold’s advantages, it has its flaws. While it's divisible, it’s not that divisible. 1 gram of gold today is worth \~$50. It’s not easy to transact with over large distances. Theft and robberies are a thing in all ages. It’s possible, and profitable, to counterfeit coins.

A way to solve many of these issues is through custodians. Deposit your gold coins at a trusted money-dealer, and they would provide you with an affidavit stating you held coins. You could then transact using your credit – in smaller denominations, and over large distances.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gold bars in a vault](https://preview.redd.it/730nhwaefth81.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=290e86fc30965ba296e96b73f4db55cefcfed668)

This, at the same time, is gold’s weakness. Because it is hard to transact with in and of itself, custodial solutions arose. Custodial solutions led to people exploiting the gold they had in custody, creating more claims on the gold than they had gold in their vaults.

[The government confiscating gold didn’t exactly help either](https://mises.org/library/great-gold-robbery-1933) – showing that gold, while valuable, was clearly physical and hard to move or hide from theft and seizure.

Finally, gold’s illusion of value could be broken in a more definitive way. Deepsea gold mining or asteroid mining could catapult the supply of gold, decreasing its value.

&gt;[**The Ocean Could Be the New Gold Rush**](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/deep-sea-mining-five-facts)

Gold’s illusion was never fully broken, gold just got less relevant over time. Given that gold itself was not ideal to use as money, custodial solutions remained needed, even after that trust was broken time and time again. At some point, this lead to a move to fiat currencies.

# Fiat currencies

Fiat currencies in most cases started out as being gold-backed. The pound, US dollar and most other currencies in the early 1900s were exchangeable into gold at a fixed exchange rate. At some point, convertibility was suspended, then never reinstated.

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold...\\"" - President Nixon, Aug 15, 1971.](https://preview.redd.it/idadc44gfth81.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ad575734e737ffd2ce541d25e91e325a98cf0e9)

So began the illusion of value in fiat currencies. With nothing truly backing them, they still retained value because everyone else saw them as having value. What else does fiat, in this example the USD, have going for it to retain its illusion?

&gt;[*Like gold, U.S. dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply - Ben Bernanke, Former Chair of the Federal Reserve.*](https://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm)

It’s easy to transact with, quite divisible, and can be transported cheaply over large distances. It’s relatively easy to verify that your paper money is not counterfeit. Perhaps most importantly, it has a large network effect due to governments wanting taxes paid in it and making it legal tender, forcing people to accept it. It’s a shared illusion that is incentivized by governments.

So what are the downsides? What could break the illusion of fiat’s value?

For one, the government can choose to break the illusion of value. India’s government recently decided, virtually overnight, [that 500 and 1000 rupee bills were no longer legal tender](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37906742).

Interestingly India [recently announced their own digital currency](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/28/rbi-recommends-india-implement-basic-version-of-cbdc/) (a so called CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currency), opening up the possibility of at some point declaring all paper money no longer legal tender.

As is illustrated by the Indian government’s banning of 500/1000 rupee notes fiat, by its very definition, is custodial. While you can keep paper money in your pocket, you are not the one deciding on the supply and value of the paper money.

With gold, a government would need to physically seize the asset to be able to access its value. With fiat, there is no such need. What a government (or central bank) can do instead is dilute everyone’s stake in the total amount of paper money. It’s far easier to control one location to print money from than it is to coerce millions of people to hand over their gold.

&amp;#x200B;

[The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press \(or, today, its electronic equivalent\), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost. - Ben Bernanke](https://preview.redd.it/9qlzvmphfth81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc685fa39520e6487e92f8d03b11c20491f31107)

This is what we have seen with fiat money time and time again. The German experience is an interesting one here. Starting with the gold mark in 1871, moving to the Papiermark in 1914 (no longer backed by gold), which was replaced by the Rentenmark (1923), then the Reichsmark (1924), to be replaced by the Deutsche Mark (1948).

&gt;[**The History of Currency in Germany**](https://remitr.com/blog/history-of-currency-in-germany/)

In Argentina, people are so used to a new currency being given out, then being debased, then being replaced by a new currency that they no longer see the peso as the de facto currency, but instead prefer to save in USD.

&gt;[**Al Jazeera: The US dollar is sewn into Argentina’s economy and its culture**](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/9/13/the-us-dollar-is-sewn-into-argentinas-economy-and-its-culture)

Argentinians are well aware that their currency is a soft currency, prone to debasement and not a good store of value. They prefer to hold a harder currency like USD, quote prices in USD, and where possible accept payment in USD.

&gt;[Thinking about it from a fundamental point of view, I would prefer to hold as little as possible in a form of cash that depreciates. In other words, when I receive payment in inflationary currency, I would prefer to exchange it into hard money as quickly as possible.](https://twitter.com/mira_hurley/status/1484198600636878851)

As an interesting aside – as in many cases where governments are aware that their sovereign currency is a weak one, Argentina has a long history of capital controls. These do not stop the outflow of local currencies, but tend to delay them.

&gt;[**Fitch: Argentina’s Capital Controls to Remain in Place for the Foreseeable Future**](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/argentina-capital-controls-to-remain-in-place-for-foreseeable-future-06-04-2021)

Debasement of currency is nothing new, and Argentina's situation is in no way unique. See for example this fascinating thread on coin debasement in Roman times.

&gt;[1/ Hard to soft Money: The Hyperinflation of the Roman Empire Thousands of years before 1920s Weimar Germany 🇩🇪 hyperinflation, there was the great currency debasement of the Roman Empire. 🧵 👇 ](https://twitter.com/drew_macmartin/status/1418927516904009738)

This is the major weakness of fiat, and is what could break its spell (and arguably already is doing so). All fiat is by design custodial, on the largest possible scale. You hold a nominal, fixed amount of the currency, but someone else decides on the total supply of the currency.

Because of this, [fiat’s illusion has been shattered many times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Notable_hyperinflationary_periods). The euro and the dollar are the exception, not the rule, and even these have been and are being debased/devalued annually.

“Bitcoin fixes this”. Does it? Largely, but not entirely.

# Crypto

The positives – Bitcoin fixes fiat’s major weakness. While fiat’s supply has always ended up being increased, debasing its value, Bitcoin’s supply is known and fixed. There will never be more than 21 million BTC. This makes it an attractive option as a store of value.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin inflation vs time](https://preview.redd.it/scwffzmqkth81.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a2e3991a891470a4d2275e25f3a1b997bfc45a3)

It has more going for it. Compared to gold, Bitcoin is easier to transport, cheaper to transact with and cheaper to verify. It’s infinitely harder to seize, and highly divisible.

However, [it has some fundamental weaknesses too](https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins). While it’s cheaper to transact with, it can still get quite expensive. Fees have reached $50+ at points, even though barely anyone uses Bitcoin. It’s quite fast to transfer, but waiting an hour for a transaction to settle is still long.

It’s hard to seize Bitcoin, but Bitcoin’s slowness and high costs mean many use custodial solutions, making it easier to seize. The more people try to use Bitcoin, [the more expensive to use and slower it becomes](https://medium.com/geekculture/bitcoin-transactions-are-slow-and-costly-lets-explain-why-a3f6f2e326db).

Other weaknesses revolve around mining. Mining equipment is easy to spot and seize.

&gt;[On the fragility of Bitcoin's strong physicality due to PoW mining, and how a node validation system is more flexible and harder to censor. ](https://twitter.com/mira_hurley/status/1486260693733105665)

More importantly, Bitcoin becomes censorable when entities get control of a large percentage of the network’s hashrate. This in itself does not need to be an issue. However, Bitcoin’s design actively incentivizes big miners getting every bigger.

&gt;[*As an example, Bitcoin's security comes from decentralization. At the same time, mining Bitcoin comes with economies of scale due to the way Bitcoin is designed. In other words, Bitcoin is designed to encourage centralization over time.*](https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins)[ ](https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins)

This is how Bitcoin’s illusion can be (and is being) broken. Its value derives from decentralization and security. When security and decentralization start being questionable, the illusion (and value) are shattered.

Another reason Bitcoin’s illusion is being broken is that it’s hardly usable as money already, even before becoming broadly adopted. [Lightning unfortunately does not fix this](https://twitter.com/mira_hurley/status/1451553977477341186).

With Bitcoin and blockchain, we’re utilizing new technology to approach the ultimate form of money. However, Bitcoin itself is not yet perfect money. For that, we have to look at how the crypto market has continued to evolve and innovate.

&gt;[**Creating the theoretical best possible money (analyzing Elon Musk's thinking in Lex Fridman's podcast)**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/creating-the-theoretical-best-possible)

We can theoretically create a form of money that transfers instantly to anywhere in the world, with $0 fees, that is scalable and that is cheap to verify. There would be no need to resort to custodial solutions for such a (near-)perfect form of money.

To store value in it we’d want it to have a known supply, like Bitcoin. We’d want it to be even harder to seize than Bitcoin (no need for custodial solutions), and we’d want it to fix Bitcoin’s flaw of decreasing decentralization and security over time. [For institutions to step in, we’d also want it to be environmentally friendly.](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/energy-hungry-bitcoin-poses-questions-for-esg-conscious-institutions-65007323)

The above describes Nano. A fixed supply money, that becomes ever more decentralized and secure over time. Low energy usage. Extremely divisible, and cheap to verify. Scalable, so custodial solutions are unnecessary.

&gt;[**Why Nano may be the ultimate store of value and reserve currency.**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8)

Transacting is instant, limited only by light speed. Moving your money from Argentina to Zambia can be done within a second, with no one able to stop the transaction and with $0 fees.

How could Nano’s illusion be broken? Governments could try to make it difficult to exchange fiat money into Nano, but can not stop the network itself. The network runs on nodes that can be moved at the speed of light, and can be run from anywhere.

&gt;[The seed could move to another jurisdiction, with downtime of literal seconds. In more extreme scenarios, it could be moved to an off-the-grid location. Run it on solar energy, link it up to satellite internet (@elonmusk Tesla Solar + Starlink?) and run it from the jungle. ](https://twitter.com/mira_hurley/status/1486260758551969792)

A fatal flaw in the code could shatter confidence, as it could in Bitcoin. So far, we’ve seen Nano do 140 million transactions without a rollback, a doublespend, or a security bug. Every day, confidence grows.

An entity could try to attack the network by getting a majority of the stake. This would already cost many billions to do, and becomes more expensive with an increasing market cap. Additionally, anyone doing so would be essentially burning their own money.

&gt;[**Protocol Design - Attack Vectors - Nano Documentation**](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/attack-vectors/)

Perhaps more realistically, Nano could never have its illusion of value shattered but it could simply never catch on. It could be that its network effect has already peaked, and that this is as far as we’re ever going to go.

&gt;[**On weak vs strong network effects, temporary vs sustainable network effects, and first-mover advantages**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-weak-vs-strong-network-effects)

I believe this to be unlikely for the simple reason that individuals and companies tend to gravitate towards more efficient solutions over time. Why stick with telegrams when you can have telephones? Why stick with Blockbuster when you can have Netflix?

&amp;#x200B;

[This \\""telephone\\"" is inherently of no value to us.](https://preview.redd.it/eatqlzf8lth81.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2c39c4e703420f058b5fb7e1852e32afc7bfb6)

In the long run, anything can happen. It is my belief that with increasing knowledge about how money works and with people increasingly having the ability to escape weaker currencies, the Argentinian experience will be illustrative.

When given the choice, why hold a currency knowing it will be debased? Why hold a weaker store of value, or use a less efficient medium of exchange? Why settle for less, when better options are available?

Illusions only last so long. I believe our current paradigm of fiat currencies is one we'll look back on and study extensively in the future, to see how this illusion managed to last so long.

personalfinance,Need urgent help with outstanding college balance about to be sent to collections,"Posting this on a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Attended college since Fall 2016 and was due to graduate spring 2020. Mental health decline led to poor grades during 2019 school year leading to all of my financial aid and federal loans to be pulled the following year. Spring 2020 was supposed to be my last semester but I still have outstanding credits I was going to take in the summer to complete my degree. Given I couldn't pay for the classes I was taking in spring 2020 I'm left with an outstanding balance a bit over $18,000. Paralyzed by this I've put it off trying to figure out how I was going to approach the balance. Parents won't cover that balance and won't cosign. Last time I talked to student aid they told me to get a private loan. Given I can't get my parents as a cosigner for a private loan I see my options running out. Possibly a friend could cosign? I have no idea. Since this balance has been outstanding for so long they expect payment within days before sending it off to a collection agency. I currently have a semi decent paying job that can pay the bills but I'm not making more than 30k a year at the moment. I need advice on the best way to approach the situation at this state. What private loan should I go for? Are there any other options? I'm only 18 credits/6 classes away from graduating and am trying to find any hope if I can actually attain that within the next few years. Honestly, this is a call of desperation.

CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA+ Experiment - Week 17 Update,"It’s time to post my normal weekly update for week 17.

For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi) as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the community to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my own research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some DD. I have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous posts and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be chosen by the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end of the experiment. For the starting point you can look here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3 and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/soo6om/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_16_update_dca/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

What a difference a week can make. The last time I posted was a mid-week update on Wednesday of last week and at the time my portfolio was only down 8.79% (not bad for a project a started close to the BTC ATH), the stock market was having a strong week too and I thought the short term indicators looked good. Less than a week later and I’m down close to 19% with a much worse overall picture again.

Looking at the portfolio today is a bit depressing to be honest. I was hoping that BTC would be hanging on above $45k which it briefly topped last week and the project would be getting closer to even or maybe even up if we had a strong February. Now, less than a week later, I’m not sure February is going to be the positive month I thought it was. I think we’re going to need some positive macroeconomic news to turn us around in the short term. It feels like every minor rally gets crushed by the smallest bit of negative news lately. This gives me the impression that the market is very unsure that any of these gains will be long lived, a sentiment which I must admit I share given the interest rate hikes that will be starting just around the corner.

The good news for anyone reading this is that every time I have come into a week feeling positive lately it’s turned out badly and vice versa. So perhaps my negativity is actually positive news for the markets.

Let’s take a look at how things are going (Spoiler alert, not well):

A few big takeaways jumped out at me in this week’s numbers. First the big picture and most depressing is the fact the value of the portfolio is down about $200 from the last update despite $100 worth of purchases being added in that time. Always tough to add money and see the portfolio value still go down.

The next big thing to note is that for the second time in the experiment BUSD stands alone in positive territory. Obviously this is the one “sure thing” as it’s a stablecoin that is collecting interest, so it’s sad to see it in first place.

Next up is that among the other coins, ATOM, which had been in first place for the last few weeks was surpassed this week by CRO. Now, relatively speaking CRO has had a decent week, it’s down since my last update but not by as much as most of the coins in this experiment. I think it may have gotten a little boost from the hype around the super bowl ads. That said, the real reason it surpassed ATOM is because ATOM had a really bad week. In addition to CRO, XRP on the strength of the positive news coming out of the lawsuit with the SEC was also able to squeak just in front of ATOM. It will be interesting to see if ATOM has a good week and is able to bounce back to the top spot or if we will have new leaders going forward.

The other thing that really jumped out at me in this week’s update is that TRAC, which has been the worst performing coin in the portfolio for some time now, had the worst week percentage wise of any of these coins as well, so now it’s sitting just shy of 50% down, compared to about 35% down as of last week. So far it looks like I picked a dog with that one, but one good pump could put it right back in the mix, so only time will tell.

Also, I think it’s worth pointing out that once again my returns on BTC, while negative, are still outpacing the portfolio. In the very beginning BTC was doing worse than the overall portfolio (in part because my first buy of BTC in this project was at $65,040), however for the past 6 or 7 weeks it has been doing as well or better than the portfolio as a whole. ETH on the other hand is doing slightly worse than the overall portfolio. So far, I think my results are making a case that it may not make sense to diversify and that investing my whole DCA into BTC would likely have turned out better. By the end of the experiment though, it could easily turn around if one of the coins in the project has a good run. Something to keep watching for sure though.

As I mentioned, I’m a little nervous heading into this week, but currently, the hour over hour numbers are looking positive, so let’s hope I’m wrong on this.

Another item to note. I have stated that in addition to regular DCAing into this portfolio, I will be “buying the dip” on occasion. I’ve done it twice so far and decided to establish a rule where I will buy based on a $10k trailing value on BTC’s price. The recent high since my last dip buy sits around $45,500, so my trigger price for a one-time purchase currently sits at $35,500. If the price of BTC should drop to this value in the near future, in addition to cursing very loudly at my phone, I will be purchasing another $25 of every coin in the portfolio at that time.

As for the upcoming week, my group B purchases are LINK, AAVE, COTI and SOL. All four of these are in the bottom half of the portfolio currently, so buying prices are at a good spot, hopefully they’ll make a turn for the positive after I DCA this week.

stocks,"Money does NOT ""go into"" stocks. It's a fallacy.","I have the impression that many people have the wrong mental model on stock market. I also had it before and it made sense on the surface. However it's not correct and it holds back people from understanding effects of things like interest rate increase, etc..

The first mistake is to think stock market as a kind of entity, like a bank. Like you give the stock market money and buy stocks. And later, you sell your stocks and take the money back.

In reality, you have money and say Alice has 1 share of a company. Alice wants to sell her stock for 100$ and you want to buy it for 100$. You give Alice 100$ and get the stock. That's it. The money is NOT is the stock market. It just changed hands.

You might ask, well but there isn't a ""Stock Market"" in your example, but it's right there hidden in plain sight. Alice's intention to sell, your intention to buy, and the actual transaction, records keeping all needs an infrastructure which we conveniently name as the ""Stock Market"". Think of millions of Alices making billions of $ of transaction daily, you have your Wall Street.

But back to the original insight: The money is not IN a stock or IN a market. It just changed hands from A to B.

Let's say Bob has 500$ and Alice has 500$ and 1 share of Astral-Travel Inc.:

**Bull market:** Alice sells the stock to Bob for 100$ (setting the initial stock price) because why not. Later Alice reads news on how cool astral travel is and how it's going to boom next year. She wants to buy the stock back. But Bob read the same article and thinks 100$ is too cheap. Haggling back and forth (Stock Market), Alice buys the stock for 200$ from Bob.

Before: Total money in circulation: 600$ (Alice)+400$ (Bob) : 1000$, Bob has 1 share, **Stock price 100$**

After : Total money in circulation: 400$ (Alice)+600$(Bob) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 200$**

**Bull market 2:** Bob's uncle is an astral travel fan and convinces him to buy the stock back because it's THE thing. Bob goes back to Alice and says he wants the stock back. But now Astral Travel is all the rage. So Alice is not willing to part so easily. She think 600$ is now a fair price. Bob has just that amount of money and he agrees to buy the share for 600$.

Before: Total money in circulation: 400$ (Alice)+600$(Bob) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 200$**

After: Total money in circulation: 1000$ (Alice)+0$(Bob) = 1000$, Bob has 1 share, **Stock price 600$** 

**Bear Market:** Now Bob wants to pay medical bills for 200$ but he ~~spent~~ invested all his money in that stock share. So he goes to Alice and tell her that he wants to sell the share for 800$. But the Astral Travel has now a competitor, the Cosmical Journey. Alice thinks the stock is not worth that much and offers 400$ instead. Having no other options, Bob takes the money and spends some on medical bills.

Before: Total money in circulation: 1000$ (Alice)+0$(Bob) = 1000$, Bob has 1 share, **Stock price 600$** 

After: Total money in circulation: 600$ (Alice)+200$(Bob)+200$(Medical Inc) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 400$**

So the price has plummeted.

**Market Crash:** A banker comes to Alice and offers to take her money and give her, say 5% interest per year. Alice is not happy with how the price fluctuates with her share and decides to take the risk-free interest. She thinks loosing sleep over her investment is not worth it. She goes to BoB and wants to sell back the stock, even without profit for 400$.  Although BoB still wants to get the share, he doesn't have the money. He also became cautious and would like to have a kind of emergency fund and not go all-in this time. So he says he can only give 50$. He doesn't have any hope of getting it at that price, since he is already anchored-on the initial offering price of 100$ and doesn't think it can go below that. Bu lo and behold, in this super shallow 2 person market place, his 50$ is the only offer. Alice, now super scared about this steep decline, quickly sells the share for 50$, fearing that it might go even lower in price. Secretly she's happy that she made some money in the ""stock market"" even though some of her latest moves were not that smart. Bob is clearly in a worse situation before all the share trades. He blames the stock market and the ill-timed medical bill. But he's hopeful that AstralTravel will make a big comeback with the riches in the future. Especially now that he bought the stock real cheap.

Before: Total money in circulation: 600$ (Alice)+200$(Bob)+200$(Medical Inc) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 400$**

After: Total money in circulation: 650$ (Alice)+150$(Bob)+200$(Medical Inc) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 50$**

So, lot's of drama between Alice and Bob but the money is just changing hands. Not going in anywhere.",finance,1644857953.0
cybersecurity,Freelancing in cyber - Which roles? Clients? Full remote?,"Hello,

I have been working for almost 10 years in cybersecurity consulting and auditing in a big audit firm, since I finished my studies, and am now thinking about going freelance (and hopefully growing from there).

I was wondering if anyone here had such experience, and recommendations.

A few questions I have:

- what kind of work do you do? (Strategy, controls and auditing, GRC, implementation projects, PMO, technical expertise on a given tech…)
- how did you find your clients?
- were you able to find 100% remote work? What kind? How?

My plan is to get some work from my current employer at least for some time, since my current team is understaffed and I don’t think me leaving will harm our relationship.

I am looking for full remote or asia-based work since I will be moving there in a few months. What kind of jobs do you think I could find that would be compatible with that?

I don’t speak the language of my target country very well yet - and I will be a foreigner - so I can’t just go and hope to find clients there easily.

I will try to work with local / regional branches of EU/US companies though.

Most of my experience revolves around assessing cybersecurity capabilities (penetration testing, red teaming, assessment of detection capabilities, and process audits on ISO 27001 or other frameworks) and advising or helping on their implementation (helping designing, implementing and testing SOC rules - mostly in Splunk).",technology,1644863945.0

personalfinance,Best way to offset interest on a $200k loan I'm sitting on?,"I opened a $200k HELOC with PNC on my home a few months ago, with the intention of maxing the line for a down payment on a new home. 

My current area, and the area I'm looking to move to are both VHCOL areas, with my current area trending sightly downward, and the new one trending upward. 

I have a 6 month emergency fund, and renting out my current house would bring in enough to cover the mortgage and HELOC payment. 

I've been looking to buy for 6 months now, but the market is so crazy right now and I haven't found anything I'd be willing to overpay for (average price in that area jumped from 800k to 1.1m), especially because I'm not desperate and I'm fine staying where I am (my wife wants to move, but not that badly).

When the rates started rising, I drew the full HELOC amount because PNC allows you to put a fixed rate lock on a draw for up to 30 years (essentially functioning as a second mortgage). Naturally I was a week too late, so the rates had jumped slightly, but I managed to lock in 5%.

My new plan is to wait a year or two and see how the market reacts to rising interest rates.

In the meantime, I'd like to put that $200k somewhere that makes enough to cover the interest. I'm considering a 50/50 split between dividend stocks and a private investment that historically returns at least 60% within the first 2 years (I should be able to save the other 40% with my income in that time).

I accepted a job offer starting in June and will be moving from Richmond, VA to the Dallas area. I'll be going from $17/hr to around $65,000/year.


I currently have around $10k in credit card debt for two different credit cards. I haven't used the cards in a couple and I'm ""aggressively"" paying them down as I can. The cards are high interest rates: $2,100 on 15.99% interest rate and $8,200 on 10.99% interest rate. Please don't judge, I have had to make a lot of tough choices with these cards. Credit score is 729 though. I also have student loans of around $65,000 and have no faith that the pause will be extended in March.

I 2010 Scion TC that I don't believe will make the trip. The check engine light has been on since I have had it, inspection expired 6/22, and I don't know enough about cars to expect it to pass again. Its also not very optimal for moving my stuff. I plan to sell what furniture I have and only take clothes and whatever fits in the car, along with my dog. I got an appraisal in May of 2021 and CarMax quoted it at $2,500. It's been a year with minimal driving so I can expect MAYBE $2k trade in.

Already on the roommate search and TX has apartment finder resources for free. It's early but I believe I can find a place for around $1,100 a month unless I find a roommate somehow by then. Hoping to save on housing costs, at least for the first year. I have a relocation bonus coming my way of $1,500 before tax.

My main question is should I take a car loan for 2 main reasons: 1. to safely make it to TX with hopefully more cargo space and 2. Maybe use the left over loan to consolidate dept on the credit cards? Is this even a thing?

I've heard some people take out home loans and use the excess to pay off student loans. I googled it and the interest rate on a car loan should be around 3%-6% which would be a serious improvement.

cardano,Genius Yield Smart Order Routers vs SundaeSwap scoopers,"SUMMARY 

SundaeSwap

I. Centralization risk – Only the scoopers can process transactions, causing centralization. 
SundaeSwap, by having the community vote for the scoopers, is trying to decentralize the 
selection of the scoopers by requiring license renewals. Eventually, the DAO will be able to 
remove misbehaving scoopers or those who provide substandard service.

II. High Scooper fees - The current scooper fees are exorbitant, at 2.5 ADA per trade. Muesliswap, which currently uses a pure-order book model, is significantly cheaper. This 2.5 ADA scooper fee, according to SundaeSwap, could come down in the future.

III. Centralization of Cardano’s network – SundaeSwap's ISO gave scoopers the ability to distribute Sundae tokens to delegators. 7 billion ADA was delegated to these scoopers, many of whom run multiple pools. This notably decreased the decentralization of Cardano’s platform, dropping the 
Nakamato Coefficient from 25 to 22. 

IV. Prioritizing transactions and potential pay-to-play – Over the weeks, scooper SPOs have begun to prioritize transactions related to SundaeSwap over other transactions on the blockchain. While the scoopers have a financial incentive to do so due to the scooper fees, this outcome harms the overall decentralization of the platform. Could a public or private actor financially incentivize SPOs in the future to prioritize its transactions? The need for scalability and parameters that promote decentralization are needed.


B. Genius Yield

I. Programmability – Compared to SundaeSwap, Genius Yield DEX’s will provide more programmability of orders, allowing a range of limit orders, stop orders, and dynamic orders that is not possible on SundaeSwap’s DEX.

II. Potentially lower fees – While Genius Yield has not released its fee structure, the SORs, unlike the scoopers, don’t receive a fee for executing an order. SORs only make money on the bid-ask spread.

III. Decentralization – Unlike SundaeSwap’s Scooper model, anyone can be a SOR. Genius Yield eventually plans to open source the code governing the Smart Order Routers, so that anyone can deploy or customize the code for their own benefit. However, the initial release of the DEX will only have vetted SOR operators before the code is made available to the public. This approach is made to ensure stability before turning over this function to the public. This method is similar to IOG running the protocol with federated nodes before slowly transitioning all block production to non-federated nodes.

IV. Liquidity for many assets – SORs could be incentivized to provide service to thinly trading markets because of wider bid/ask spreads. LPs could be incentivized to provide liquidity to these thinly traded tokens for higher LP fees. However, SORs and LPs could shift their resources away from thinly traded tokens to other tokens or pools with higher profit potential if interest in the thinly traded token is too low.

V. Concentrated Liquidity offer – No other DEX currently available on Cardano’s mainnet offers concentrated liquidity. Offering this option for users could see LPs shift their resources to Genius YIeld’s platform.

CryptoCurrency,Official statement from BlockFi regarding recent regulatory developments,"# A Letter from Our Founders: Pioneering a Path Forward to Regulatory Clarity

We are pleased to share that today we have reached an agreement with U.S. federal and state regulators – outlining a clear path forward for BlockFi and for Americans to earn crypto interest. Today’s resolution outlines the finer points of that agreement, and we wanted to share some additional context with you all.

At BlockFi, we envision a world where blockchain powered financial products and services accelerate prosperity worldwide by providing more access and better economic outcomes. We are proud to have reached this agreement which creates a foundational path forward for our U.S. clients and the wider crypto industry.

*What’s along this path?*

Put simply – increased regulatory clarity we’ve been hoping for. We were the first crypto company to receive a state-level license to issue crypto-backed loans to U.S. consumers in 2018 and this is the next major example of how we prioritize cooperation with regulators. 

With today’s resolution, we are leading the creation of a new regulatory landscape for crypto and our clients. As we shared earlier, we intend to file or confidentially submit a registration statement to the SEC for **BlockFi Yield**, a new crypto interest-bearing security. 

*What does this mean for you* – *our clients?*

Existing U.S. BlockFi Interest Account (BIA) clients will maintain their accounts and **will continue to receive interest as they always have**. BIA clients based in the United States may not add further assets into their BIAs. Once the BlockFi Yield registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, BIAs of U.S. clients will be exchanged for BlockFi Yield and you will be able to add incremental assets to your account, unless clients instruct us otherwise. 

All U.S. clients will receive an email and in-product communications with further details on changes to their client experience. If you have questions, please contact our Client Success team here. 

Existing and prospective BlockFi clients outside of the U.S. are unaffected by these changes and continue to have full access to the platform, including opening new BIAs and adding assets to existing BIAs.

The path to broad crypto adoption is one that has included some mountain top views (the latest all time high!) and deep valleys (brr… crypto winter) over the years. We have worked tirelessly with regulators on your behalf to chart this exciting path forward, and we look forward to our next chapter of pioneering innovative, crypto-powered products for our clients worldwide. 

We thank you for continuing on this journey with us and will continue working hard to deliver more value to you through our products and services.

With gratitude, 

Zac, Flori and the BlockFi Team

CryptoCurrency,BlockFi Update for Existing Customers in the US,"Below is the text of the e-mail I received from BlockFi support just now:

&gt;Today Zac and Flori shared a regulatory update. As a result of this much needed regulatory clarity, we wanted to alert you to updates to your account while we go through the securities registration process for BlockFi Yield, our new crypto interest-bearing security.  
&gt;  
&gt;What will happen with my BlockFi Interest Account?  
&gt;  
&gt;You will still have your BlockFi Interest Account (BIA)! You will continue to earn crypto interest, which will be deposited monthly in your BIA.  
&gt;  
&gt;Can I add funds to my BIA?  
&gt;  
&gt;No. BIA clients based in the United States may not add further assets into their BIAs. You’ll be able to add additional funds into your BlockFi Wallet, which is the default account for buying, selling, and storing your crypto assets.  
&gt;  
&gt;You are able to move assets into your Wallet to trade, but once moved from BIA to Wallet, they cannot be moved back and they will cease to earn interest.  
&gt;  
&gt;When can I get BlockFi Yield?  
&gt;  
&gt;This is dependent upon the registration process with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Once the BlockFi Yield registration statement is filed and declared effective by the SEC, BIAs of U.S. clients will be exchanged for BlockFi Yield, unless clients instruct us otherwise.  
&gt;  
&gt;For further questions, please feel free to contact our Client Success team.

Basically, I have some coins in my interest earning account within BlockFi and that money will continue to earn interest as if nothing had changed, however if I want to exchange it for other coins, I have to move it out of the interest bearing account and into the trading account at which point those funds are no longer eligible to move back into the interest bearing account.

I have a small amount of money in USDC on BlockFi that I have been using to fund DCA purchases of BTC, ETH and BUSD on BlockFi and earn interest on those as part of an alt-coin experiment I'm doing (you can check my profile if you're interested).

Since I can no longer add funds to these accounts, I need to find a new home for coins that I can earn interest on. I am familiar with Celsius, Gemini and Nexo although I don't currently have an account with any of them. My question to the community is where would you recommend I move the remainder of this experiment to?

In case it helps, a quick rundown on what I'd really like. Obviously I'm based in the US. I am okay linking a bank account and doing KYC. I plan to pay taxes on this and honestly I prefer a company that I trust over one paying a slightly higher percentage. This is why I picked BlockFi over the others in the first place. When I did my initial research I though BlockFi seemed to have their ducks in a row and actually the lower interest rates made me think that it was likely more sustainable than some of the other exchanges out there. At the time Celsius was my second choice and will probably be the first place I look if the community doesn't tell me there's a better option today.

An executive order is a signed, written, and published directive from the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.

Executive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect.

CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserve officials call for a measured response to inflation.,"Federal Reserve officials are pushing back on the idea that central bankers might raise interest rates in between meetings and made it clear that while they are poised to begin lifting rates in March, the initial increase may be smaller than what investors have begun to expect.

&amp;#x200B;

Markets began to bet on a double-size rate increase — half a percentage point — after January inflation data came in surprisingly high last week. Those expectations grew after the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis president, James Bullard, suggested that the Fed might need to respond decisively with a large increase or even an inter-meeting move, something the central bank typically reserves for emergencies.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Bullard seemed to walk back his comments slightly on Monday, acknowledging during a CNBC interview that he is just one policy official and that the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, will lead on deciding how quickly to pull back support. He reiterated that he would like to see a rapid pace of increases, taking rates to about 1 percent by July — but he did not repeat that an increase in between meetings might be a good idea, saying instead said the Fed needs to react to data in an “organized” way.

&amp;#x200B;

“Our credibility is on the line here,” said Mr. Bullard, who votes on policy this year. Regional Fed presidents rotate in and out of four voting seats; the New York Fed president and Fed governors in Washington have a constant vote.

&amp;#x200B;

Mary C. Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that the Fed needed to get moving, but that its approach ought to be “measured.”

&amp;#x200B;

“I see that it is obvious that we need to pull some of the accommodation out of the economy,” Ms. Daly said on “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “But history tells us with Fed policy that abrupt and aggressive action can actually have a destabilizing effect on the very growth and price stability we’re trying to achieve.”

Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, similarly said in a SiriusXM interview on Monday that he favored raising rates “steadily.”

“I think it’s timely to get started, and steadily move back toward prepandemic levels,” Mr. Barkin said. He noted that while the Fed carried out its rate moves, it would get a better handle on whether inflation was beginning to settle down and could adjust the timing and pace of its moves accordingly.

The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Esther George, pushed back on Mr. Bullard’s ideas even more bluntly. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday, she suggested that there would be a debate over a big rate increases in March but said she hadn’t yet settled on the idea, and underscored that moves between meetings were reserved for emergencies.

“I don’t know that I’d call the markets reacting to data an emergency here, because frankly, in my own forecast of looking where inflation was moving, the print was not a surprise,” she said.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Bullard acknowledged that he had yet to convince his colleagues that a relatively rapid pace of upcoming rate increases was appropriate.

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR and APY becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency,1644873398.0

Bitcoin,Technical process for generating USD out of thin air,"We all know that the biggest difference between fiat and BTC is scarcity. BTC is generated via hashing by miners and is capped at 21M coins. USD, on the other hand, is generated by the federal reserve as they lower the federal funds rate and create incentives for borrowing money.

It’s my understanding that when new fiat is introduced to the system, most of it is created digitally. That is, it is not actually printed as is commonly said. Most of these digital dollars exist in a COBOL database.

This makes me curious. How exactly are these databases administered? Who controls when to add value to the balance sheet? Doing so requires software engineers, managers, authorizations, etc. Given that BTC is fully trustless, this process is the exact opposite.

Does anyone have any insight into this? Perhaps anyone from the banking industry? From a technical standpoint it’s fascinating. It’s also interesting to compare to BTC.",cryptocurrency,1644874412.0
CryptoCurrency,I think we should already get mentally prepared for a crash due to Ukraine-Russia Politics.,"The current week is probably crucial to this ongoing conflict. Many have been saying it's going to happen this week, the next day, any time and so on. As we can see stock markets are already taking the hit. So we should start to prepare for the worst... But hope for the best ofc.

Obviously no one wants a war. And we all don't know what those boomers are doing with that political shit. But one thing is for sure. If the market dips just because a FED member says the word inflation, then it's certainly going to crash here.

It's obviously all just one of the other multiple possibilities of what could happen. But I would recommend getting prepared for this worst one. As we should always be prepared for the worst but hope for the best. That does not mean we are bearish, im also not expecting a major crash if it happens, just a flash crash of like modest 15%.

stocks,Potential Outcomes/Market response if Inflation moderates,"Currently [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) is predicting a 61% chance for a 50-75 bps (I'm assuming that really refers to 50 bps) rate hike at the March 16th meeting. Goldman Sachs is saying a 50 bps hike in March is unlikely, but are predicting 7 rate hikes this year. Citi says 150 bps this year and 50 bps in March. Credit Suisse says 175 bps this year with 50 bps in March.

On the other hand, I'm hearing inflation has already peaked. Although inflation has increased dramatically, CPI is on the way down, and peaked back in October 2021. Some analysts argue it's a world problem and not a US problem, and when supply chains get sorted out inflation will moderate organically, at least to some extent.

CPI:

* 0.9 percent in October.
* 0.7 percent in November.
* 0.6 percent in December.
* 0.6 percent in January.

Currently it seems like the market is pricing in the doom and gloom scenario of a 50 bps rate hike in March, and hikes at future meetings totaling 150-175 bps. On the off chance inflation starts to tick lower and the Fed can ease up on the aggressiveness, what parts of the market do well?

personalfinance,Should I file 1040-X over a $5 mistake?,"I just realized I forgot to report capital gains distributions on my 2020 tax return, Schedule D, line 13. I should have reported $31.14 from the 1099-DIV box 2a, which results in $5 more federal tax and $2 more state tax.

Should I amend both returns? I don't mind the hassle, though it seems like a waste of paper. What I'm unsure about is that this affects my 2021 tax return too since I took the SALT deduction for 2020. Specifically, it decreases 2021 Schedule 1, line 1 by $2, which increases my federal refund by $1 (but makes no difference after rounding for state refund). And if I file the 1040-X and my 2021 return at the same time, I don't know if I can assume they'll process them in that order and figure out what I did.

So my options are:

1. Just ignore it, 1099-DIV was furnished to the IRS so they would have fixed it if they cared.
2. Amend 2020, and file 2021 with Schedule 1, line 1 taking the amendment into account.
3. Amend 2020, but ignore it for the purposes of 2021 (the IRS won't complain that I overpay $1).",finance,1644898445.0

This has gotten increasingly frustrating since I'm apartment hunting and some places won't even look at applications with a sub-700 credit score. 

Here's what I've got going on, per my latest report via Mint:

Total accounts: 7

* My Chase card, \~2.5 years old, all payments have been on time and no credit carried between months
* A credit account through Microsoft/Dell for a tablet that's been paid off in full with all on-time payment. 3.5 years old.
* 4 accounts of federal student loans, ranging from 14.5-12.5 years old. All paid on time, though often with the help of the REPAYE (Revised Pay-As-You-Earn) plan to keep individual monthly payments within reach.
* A Chase card that I am an Authorized User on from a previous relationship.\* 9 years old, minimum or more paid on time every month, but a balance of 60-80% of the card's limit rides every month. The credit limit on this card alone is more than I make in a year, and the credit usage REALLY drags down my otherwise-perfect 0. (It's currently at 77% used and my personal credit usage is listed at 65%)

On-time payments: 100%

Credit utilization: 65%

Age of credit: 9.6 years

Credit inquiries: 0

Derogatory marks: 0

&amp;#x200B;

\* We managed an actually-fairly amicable breakup. I've stayed on the card as an AU because it's been the safety net beneath my safety net. This particular ex makes about 10 times what I do annually, and I've never had to actually use the card.

According to experts, this zone contains about 83 billion barrels of oil and 1,500 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. In addition, the subsoil of the Arctic contains rare-earth metals such as chromium and manganese. However, in order to develop the Arctic territories and create the appropriate infrastructure in these harsh climatic conditions, there is a need to invest significant funds.In this regard, programs to create a favorable investment climate are actively applied in order to attract potential investors. The Russian government has developed a state program to promote entrepreneurial activity in the Arctic regions. Specially created preferential conditions for the implementation of projects will help to increase private investment, as well as to attract human resources. To this end, Russian legislation provides for a number of measures, including preferential taxation, subsidies for cost recovery, lower interest rates on loans and much more.In addition to the implementation of internal state programs, Russia actively cooperates with other countries in attracting investment to the Arctic region. For example, in 2019, together with South Korea, the ""Nine Bridges"" concept was adopted, which highlighted nine key areas of investment cooperation. Within the framework of this concept, the launch of the Vladimir Monomakh oil tanker in December 2020, which was the first result of cooperation between Russia and Korea in the Arctic shipbuilding industry. In addition to cooperation with Korea, Russia actively attracts funds from non-Western development institutions established by China and India to build Arctic infrastructure.Thus, the investment climate in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation is generally characterized by a high demand for investment and great economic potential.

However with interest rates being low, banks lending more, and me being in a position where i could probably get on the property ladder, I’m very confused about the path I should take.

A.) stay in rentals - collect my rent each month (hard to save it tbh), hope I progress well career wise and let the value of my flat increase.

B.) partially remortgage, get a deposit together for my first house and get on the property ladder with my own mortgage.

This ultimately helped support the US Dollar, resulting in EUR/USD getting rejected just below 1.1500 despite the ECB's hawkish pivot. 

However, the pair continued to pullback on Friday and yesterday, as officials now appear to be bracing for the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine within the coming days. This would undoubtedly throw the Eurozone into turmoil, and potentially put EUR/USD on track to reattempt a break below the key support area around 1.2000. 

Of course, nothing is certain at this point, and there is still the likelihood of a more diplomatic approach being taken. If this turns out to be the case, it could alleviate some of the bearish pressure that has been mounting on the EUR and help the pair bounce, or at least consolidate its recent pullback.

My family has been very overbearing over the past few years, and I don't want to end up like my older brothers, who are pushing 30 and 40 respectfully but never took a chance and moved out. I should be able to afford at least a studio unit, or preferably, split a two-bedroom with a friend, but I'm still trying to figure out debt and other expenses:

* I owe $24k in federal loans
* My parents and older brother still pay for my phone bill and auto insurance. They'll probably slap this in my face when I tell them I want to move out, but I *want* to pay my own bills.
* I've had a credit card for three years and have very good credit. For the most part, I only use it for a few streaming subscriptions and small purchases like haircuts. I've never missed a payment, either.
* I cook but don't spend much on groceries or eat multiple times a day. I typically buy about $200-$250 worth of groceries a month and call it a day after eating a large breakfast. 
* I share a 14-year old car with my brother and sister, and it always has maintenance issues that render it unusable for some time. I would need to buy a car to get to work or spend six hours a day on the bus or train.
* For entertainment, I'll need to find a new gym after graduation and budget to eat out with friends a couple of times a month.

stocks,(2/15) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, February the 15th, 2022-

# [Dow futures jump more than 400 points as Russia pulls back some troops from Ukraine border](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures jumped on Tuesday morning after Russia appeared to be backing away from an immediate invasion of Ukraine, cooling geopolitical tensions that have knocked the stock market down the last three days.
*****
&gt; The Russian Defense Ministry said it had begun returning some troops to deployment bases after training exercises near the Ukrainian border.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 440 points, or 1.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 1.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 2.1%. All three major benchmarks were down in the three prior sessions. The S&amp;P 500 is about 8% from its record high.
*****
&gt; Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said troops who had recently been posted to Russia’s southern and western military districts — which share a border with Ukraine — had completed their drills and “have already begun loading onto rail and road transport and will begin moving to their military garrisons today.”
*****
&gt; WTI crude prices fell 3%, while the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.04% as tensions eased. The VanEck Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund which invests in big Russian stocks, jumped nearly 5% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; In addition to the Ukraine drama, investors will get another look at inflation Tuesday. The January producer price index, which measures final-demand wholesale prices, will be released at 8:30 and is expected to show a monthly gain of 0.5%.
*****
&gt; Airline and cruise stocks led early premarket gainers while energy companies were the biggest losers as oil prices fell.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a volatile Monday trading session.
*****
&gt; The Dow closed lower by 171.89 points, or 0.5%, after falling more than 400 points at one point. The S&amp;P 500 dropped as much as 1.2% before ending the day 0.4% lower. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9% at one point before closing just below the flatline.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as the Russia-Ukraine conflict had appeared to escalate. Secretary of State Antony Blinken ordered the closing of the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, citing a “dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces” on Ukraine’s border.
*****
&gt; Concerns over multiple Fed rate hikes also kept investors on edge.
*****
&gt; St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC’s Steve Liesman on Monday that the central bank needs to be aggressive in fighting inflation. The consumer price index rose last month at its fastest year-over-year pace since 1982, leading Citigroup and Goldman Sachs to increase their rate hike outlook for 2022 to seven.
*****
&gt; “I do think we need to front-load more of our planned removal of accommodation than we would have previously. We’ve been surprised to the upside on inflation. This is a lot of inflation,” Bullard said.
*****
&gt; “Our credibility is on the line here and we do have to react to the data,” he added. “However, I do think we can do it in a way that’s organized and not disruptive to markets.”

personalfinance,Confused Graduate Student Dealing with Scholarships on Taxes,"Good morning guys,

I am running into issues with my taxes. I am on a scholarship from the NSF that pays for tuition, fees, and around $34k a year as stipend. None of this is taxed (but it isn't tax-exempt since it is personal gain), there are no W-2s, and the numbers are not on my 1098T. As a result, all federal and state (MD) taxes were compiled to my account and says I will owe just short of $3000, which is obviously killer as a graduate student. 

I guess any help would be appreciated... but how can I possibly lower this? It is hard to input amounts since there is no W-2 and my 1098T is essentially blank. Is there a way to input this to get Lifetime Learning Credit? Or able to get more tax breaks as inputting some money as taxable? It is all so very confusing... I've read some posts and they say the IRS can't even verify the amounts so you wouldn't get chased down by them. Obviously I want to be law abiding and pay the taxes owed, but not sure if there is something else I can try!",finance,1644932282.0
personalfinance,"Can’t afford loan, need advice","Hey everyone, hoping this is a good place to ask this. 
My husband and I bought a camper (in my name) last year while we were in good financial standing. We were on track to being able to pay the loan off in about a year. A couple months later everything changed; we hit a bunch of hardships and ran into financial difficulties. We are now starting to get back on track and get our heads back above water, however, we just can’t afford the loan anymore. I tried speaking to our credit union once before about our situation but they were very rude to me a scoffed at me about how we already can’t afford the loan and bought the camper less than a year ago. My question is: what is my best option? Voluntary repossession? Do my best to keep paying the loan even tho upcoming payments will be late? Are there other options? There is still $35,000 on the loan and the unit is only worth about $25,000. I can’t sell it. I can’t refinance it. I’m worried about paying the deficiency amount if I give it back as obviously I can’t afford that either. Any thoughts or suggestions welcome.",finance,1644932332.0

CryptoCurrency,"I made a difference due to making NBTC, Not Bitcoin on Viper Swap.","&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: you can no longer create a coin with fake liquidity the way I did and have the charts page work to show you the value, liquidity and transactions of your token. All because of my Shenanigans (and possibly others trying to copy the same formula) 

Hi All 

So not sure if you saw my post a while back about making a huge value crypto called NBTC, it ended up having billions in liquidity all fake though as was all from other created coins. Then its the price too, due to my post it started out valued at $3,866 but people actually brought it even though the post was just showing people how easy it was to make a coin look good but is a scam all the way. the Price topped out to 321 million basically more than the market cap of the whole crypto space. 

Here are a few screen shots to show you the journey I went through with this 

&amp;#x200B;

[Here is the first screen shot after I did some transactions to buy small amounts after I added Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/9r5ajz6510i81.png?width=1871&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0962d3d5643b27141a520b0cc5665fa2eb1e5346)

&amp;#x200B;

[After I posted the warning people actually started to buy it getting the price to jump to over 2 million now showing half a million in liquidity and nearly $20 in transactions.](https://preview.redd.it/vbn1to0f10i81.png?width=1869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92d79508dca02a642357e7c54a83e9badf95e873)

&amp;#x200B;

[then people went crazy cos they saw it going up I guess so $250 in transactions 320 million value and liquidity into its billions now.](https://preview.redd.it/yvg34trv10i81.png?width=1841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1969ab6f78be131bbc4344e537dfd640570dd27)

&amp;#x200B;

[When I got back from work that day someone had seen their opportunity and sold basically all they had brought probably for a bit of a gain too this was the start of the end of NBTC ](https://preview.redd.it/85gysxsm20i81.png?width=1879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=888d97e815d47194900570ed6864afd95f2babf7)

&amp;#x200B;

[after all this for about a week this is what you saw if you searched for NBTC and it would seem that Viperswap have actually implemented some changes forever after this.](https://preview.redd.it/9rwfp05w20i81.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab59e35c6a343b8ead29d52de7a698fdf6a1f2ff)

&amp;#x200B;

So now if you go and try to make a coin properly on Jenny Token then add real liquidity and buy some you will have the same as the start of my process (except the crazy value) but if you try to fake the liquidity in any way this is now what the viperswap charts page will show for your coin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based in USA

I opened a custodial savings account (UGMA) for my three year old nephew when interest rates were decent, but now it’s just sitting there and it’s a pain to deal with. I’ve tried convincing his parents to open an account, but they’re quite unmotivated when it come things like this. Trustworthy, but unmotivated…

I’ve looked at putting it into general index funds along side my investments, but opening an investment account for a minor appears to be even more of a pain. 

What are some options that I can easily manage myself (without lawyers or CPAs), that won’t require my nephew’s parents to adjust their tax returns or file one for my nephew, and hopefully won’t negatively impact my nephew’s eligibility for financial aid when he turns that age.

So what’s this little known investment that the Batman himself shills?](https://youtu.be/F_MYms0wUmQ?t=1) Savings bonds! You heard me right, savings bonds, [specifically Series I savings bonds which pay interest linked directly to the current inflation rate](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm). The interest rate on I-Bonds [right now is 7.12](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm)%! That’s a US government security that pays a multitude higher interest than any bank and more than most blue chip corporate bonds are yielding right now. The interest rate on I Bonds is adjusted to reflect the inflation rate every 6 months. At certain points, the Treasury department will also sell I-bonds that have a second additional fixed interest portion to the I-Bond’s yield, however as of right now this fixed interest portion is set at 0% so any I-bonds bought right now are tied directly to the inflation rate only. [Unlike TIPS securities sold by the Treasury department, the principal of an I-Bond stays fixed (TIPS lose value when deflation occurs). The interest rate on an I-bond will never go below 0% in the event of deflation](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tipsvsibonds.htm). I-Bonds can be purchased directly from the US Government via its [TreasuryDirect website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/tdhome.htm).

So, as with anything on here, the question becomes, what’s the catch? There is in fact a limit on the amount of I-Bonds you can purchase, $10,000 in electronic I-bonds per year can be bought through the government’s treasury direct website. [You can also separately buy up to $5,000 in paper I Bonds by electing on your tax return to receive your tax refund in I-Bonds.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/faq/faq_irstaxfeature.htm) Finally, and most importantly, you must hold I-bonds for at least 1 year prior to being able to cash them in and any I-Bond redeemed prior to 5 years from the date of issue loses the three months of interest preceding the redemption. Unlike some other treasuries, the bonds also cannot be resold to other investors. I do not currently hold any series I Bonds.",finance,1644939858.0

personalfinance,Buying now vs buying later,"A thought I'm pondering:

We really should upgrade our exterior doors (2 regular doors, 1 with sidelight, 1 to the garage.) They are all original to the house (1960), and are wood so they don't hold the heat as well as they could, both in terms of insulation and seal (we've replaced some with mixed results.)

We now have access to a line of credit. We desperately needed to change our windows, so those we've done and should have what we didn't save up in cash, paid off of the LOC in less than a year.

*What I'm wondering is, in view of inflation being at or near our interest rate on the LOC, would it make to upgrade the doors before saving up cash? Say it takes a year to save up enough for the doors, but they cost 6% more, we're no further ahead than if we pay 6% on the amount on the LOC for a year, right?*

Other benefits, if we were to buy them sooner using credit, would be energy savings during heating season (in Canada, so almost 8 months) and some level of increased comfort during the summer, as we don't have AC.

Hello Reddit. As you can see I’m spread pretty thin. COVID and having 2 kiddos really consumed a big chunk of my cash over the last 3 years. My long term goal was to turn my home into a rental property, but as you can see it’s very tempting to try and sell my home and payoff all the debt.

I also talked to some folks about a “debt resolution” program that involves closing all of my credit cards and hurting my credit, and negotiating on a lower amount of debt to payoff over 5 years. Also not very attractive to me.

It seems like most people are either too extreme about their security (not a bad thing but time consuming) or too lax about it. I want to tell everyone ways they can improve their digital security as I found several flaws in mine. 

Passwords: simple enough, but always skimped on. Passwords should always be unique and never recycled. They should be ideally written down on paper but this isn't always feesible so a good password manager is a must. 

Don't trust DMs about ""opportunities"" that sound too good: from reddit to instagram I always get spam that either attempts to fish for personal data or input my wallet to ""mine"" they're all scams 100% don't waste your time.

Emails: Cycle emails every now and then or at the very least keep emails dedicated to different things. Spam goes to one, banking another, one for social media etc. Always opt out of newsletters and mailing lists unless you really care about it. Do not open any link that is not requested, double check sender emails

Digital footprint: maintain as small of a footprint you can, we are often the weakest link of a security system. Information displayed outwards can be used against you. If you have a pet on Facebook or instagram and a hacker is trying to reset your password one possible security question might be a pet name. At the end of the day hackers don't get the whole piece at once, they gather puzzle pieces until they have just enough information to hack you. This is one rule I can do better on.

At the end of the day security systems are getting a lot better, exchanges are starting to guarantee funds and are putting a lot of secondary systems into place such as anti phishing codes, authentication, and withdrawal timers. Yet the user still remains the most vulnerable and easily spoofed aspect of a system. It's an ongoing battle but take some time every month to review you accounts.

Hi I'll try to keep this as simple as possible. I'm just afraid that soon I might start OWING money on taxes or that I'm doing something terribly wrong.

Ever since I've left the military and joined the job market my Federal returns have been VERY LOW. Last year I would have ended up OWING money if it weren't for the fact that I got reductions for being in school full time. This year I am not in school.

Last year while working for Company A I had to switch from Contractor 1 over to Contractor 2 so I received two W-2's. Because of the return frustrations I mentioned earlier I THOUGHT I'd looked up the correct way to fill out my Tax paperwork to ensure the largest return even if it meant smaller paychecks. But that doesn't seem to be the case at all.

I filled out my taxes with HR Block. After I submitted the W-2 for Contractor 1 my return was around 1700. However, once I added my second W-2 from Contractor 2 that amount shrunk to about 80 dollars. BUT, once I deleted both W-2s and only re-added the second one it says I can expect a return of around 800.

So, separately I would get 1700 and 800 but when I combine my W-2s all that disappears and I would only be getting 80??? Am I doing something wrong, is there some tax or something that penalizes me for working for two different contractors in a year. Could I possibly be filling out my W-4 incorrectly?

personalfinance,7k Debt consolidation after finding some stability?,"Due to some hiring delays I've been working minimally at my new job (100 over 3 months) and had to burn through my saving and buy new gear for field work and now I have about 7k in credit card debt at a 24% interest rate.  I've finally started working full time and will have income to start paying everything off rather quickly.  I have very little experience with personal finance.  I've always saved up and then blew through all my saving in transition to a new job and moving (seasonal wildlife work).  

Now I finally have started working and getting paid what I'm worth I'm ready to tackle this but not sure where to start.  Should I open a new card with 0% interest and transfer my balance or work through a debt consolidation company?  Any other ideas would be helpful.

Details: 
Debt - 7k across 2 cards
Interest - 24%
Income - 3,600 - 5,000 monthly

personalfinance,Investing down payment while keeping options open to buy real estate,"I'm 40, married, have a 3-year old child. Wife and I are both maxed out on 401k and IRA investments. We have an emergency fund and no debt. We have saved a good amount of money for the downpayment for a condo in NYC, where we live (currently in a savings account). We were close to buying a place a few weeks ago, but the deal fell through at the last minute. Now with rising interest rates and a crazy real estate market here, we feel that it's best to continue renting until there is more inventory and/or rates go down.

personalfinance,28 years old and single -- need help with my financial plan,"Hello! I have been spending a lot of time recently working on my finances and am starting to feel unsure about what direction I should go in.

I am 28 years old, single, and currently live with my parents in SoCal. I had purchased a condo back in 2018 but ended up selling it because of a relationship ending. I accumulated some debt on top of my stupid financial decisions made throughout my 20s. I have put in some serious effort to recover and get myself on the right track.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I am at:

&amp;#x200B;

Net income: 4k a month (paid bi-weekly)

Savings: 10k

457(b): 15k (5% pre-tax contributed per paycheck)

CalPers pension: 14k (7% pre-tax contributed per paycheck)

Roth IRA: $1,700 ($250 contributed per month.)

&amp;#x200B;

CC Debt: $3,370 (I pay $340 towards this since they are at 0%. I will pay them off before interest hits)

School/Fed Loans: 18k (I haven't paid since before the pandemic. It will be $210 a month starting in May 2022. Roughly 5% interest once they start again)

&amp;#x200B;

Car 1: I owe 25k, and it is worth 26.5k. I drive this car everyday but am open to the idea of selling it. I paid large lump sums all throughout last year so I don't have a payment until April 2022. If I keep it, I will refinance it at roughly $450 a month.

Car 2: it is paid off, and worth about 20k. This car is older and was a dream of mine to own. It's hard to drive everyday and not as reliable or comfortable. But I also have been working remote and don't drive nearly as often as I used to. I go back and forth about selling it but I am not sure If I will regret it. In a perfect world, I would own this car forever. A small part of me would be relieved though if I got rid of it.

&amp;#x200B;

So after all is said and done, I bring in about 4k and spend about $1,800 on the following:

cell phone ($27), car insurance ($225), gas ($200), credit card payments ($340), Roth contributions ($250), amazon prime ($11), gym ($35), and food/fun ($800).

Right now I am able to save about 2k a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimate goal is to buy my own home again, but by myself.

Do I sell Car 1 and just suck it up and drive Car 2? or Sell Car 2 and add that 20k to my savings which would get me closer to having enough for a mortgage down payment. Or just not worry about it and keep saving money? Should I keep adding to my savings account or should I consider upping my Roth IRA contributions and 457 contributions? Or should I start paying down school and the credit cards?

&amp;#x200B;

So many options and I feel overwhelmed.",finance,1644972524.0

inflation,Inflation is One of our Government's Few Successes! Part 1,"Inflation is a purposeful policy of the US government, at least two of its branches, congress and the White House.   It is also the purposeful policy of the Democratic and Republican Parties.   *Inflation is one of the very few, if any, successful policies of our government!*   

Inflation is good for debtors.   It is wonderful to have borrowed money when it bought much and to pay it back when it buys little.   That is what our government does.  It created enormous public debt to finance our warring in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and many other countries, to build huge aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and bombs, etc., and to save banks and other corporate favorites from their bad and fraudulent behavior up to 2008;  then again in 2021 when COVID subtracted from their already dangerously shallow earnings.    No country in history had gone so far into the red as the USA!    

The only way out is to repeat the devaluation of the US dollar that has occurred since the 1920s; only much faster.    We are on the way, driven by our irresponsible government of rascals and scoundrels.  Who are they?   They are our ""best"" people, the President and his White House economic advisers, the Sec'y of the Treasury,  the congressional Finance and Banking Committees, the rest of the congressional sheep,  and the collection of major bankers who gather as the US Federal Reserve Bank.  They  are the covert causers of our *inflation.*  They don't work for the benefit of US workers and middle-class citizens.   They work for the super-rich.  They have been bought by Wall Street, the finance industry, banks and insurance companies, and the military-industrial complex, made famous by Pres. Eisenhower, who did little to stop them but talk and at the end of his presidency.

In 2012 I buy a home for: $200k
Down payment: $40k

Interest rate: 4.00% 

Lets say I make my mortgage payments on time for 10 years and now refinance rates have dropped significantly. Lets say the rate is now 3% however the fair market value of my home for whatever reason has gone down to $100k. How would I be able to refinance? I have lost my equity I put in my home and actually have negative equity. So if I do refinance I would have to pay more out of pocket to pay off the original home I think. 

In this scenario do I just not refinance and keep paying at my current interest rate and hope my home fair market value on the home recovers in the future and interest rates lower at that time as well?

This is simply information I am sharing for your benefit.  The individual or collective actions of the members of this sub will have no effect on my investments or vice-versa.  This is not financial advice.  This is not a discussion about target prices.  This is simply a discussion of observations by experts in the field about where we are right now with equities and the potential risks and impacts ahead based on leading indicators and forward-looking metrics that are themselves subject to certain risks.**

John Rekenthaler, VP of Research at Morningstar, notes that there are three major declines that have already presaged a 2000-like crash:

1. Speculators (e.g. Cathie Wood's ARKK).
2. Small-growth stocks.
3. Large-growth stocks.

As Rekenthaler notes in his recent piece ""[The Stock Market's Dominoes Are Falling](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1076351/the-stock-markets-dominoes-are-falling)"", published in the *Rekenthaler Report* at Morningstar Investment Research:

&gt;On Jan. 5 of this year, my former Morningstar colleague John Coumarianos published a highly prescient article. Noting that that the small-growth indexes were drooping, with the most aggressive of such indexes performing the worst, John wondered whether such behavior was the proverbial canary in the coal mine. The last time small-growth companies so badly trailed other stocks, he points out, was early 2000. Shortly thereafter, blue-chip growth stocks also turned belly-up.  
&gt;  
&gt;As they have since done.

By other metrics there's a certain number I keep coming back to, and it's more generous than Rekenthaler's note that profitability in the aftermath of 2000 eroded by 50%.

Whether we look at the premium to nominal Market-to-GDP, or we look at CAPE Ratio, or we look at the pre pandemic valuations of major companies in the index as an indicator of what mean reversion looks like, I think we're looking at 40% every which way.

Does that mean it will happen?  Not necessarily, no.  I'm not a prognosticator.  But it does mean that if the interest rate hikes in March and beyond do cause companies to revise 2022 forecast once they understand the full impact of Fed actions on cost of capital, we could be looking at a decline that extends well into 2023.",finance,1644989782.0

I am trying to understand what is going on right now regarding inflation. My knowledge is very limited, but here is what I think I understand as of now.

When the pandemic started, the Fed lowered the interest rates to stimulate the economy and avoid a recession. During the pandemic, disruption of supply chains coupled with high demand (since we managed to avoid a recession) caused an inflation surge. In order to slow inflation, the Fed should raise interest rates, but that could disrupt the stock markets.

This is where it gets mushy in my head. Why would higher interest rates slow inflation, and why could they disrupt the stock markets? How exactly are all these concepts tied together, and how do we move forward?

# [Stock futures are down slightly after major averages snap 3-day losing streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures edged lower in morning trading Wednesday, after registering gains the previous day amid signs of tensions easing between Russia and Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were off by about 80 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 shares dipped 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures eased about 0.2%.
*****
&gt; ViacomCBS was the biggest loser in early action Wednesday, with shares falling 6.5% premarket after the company said it is rebranding itself as Paramount Global to focus on streaming. At the same time, the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings.
*****
&gt; Shares of Wynn Resorts rose 1.8% after the casino operator beat on revenue, though it posted a larger-than-expected loss per share.
*****
&gt; Markets have been driven largely by concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the Federal Reserve’s plan to hike interest rates.
*****
&gt; “Traders continue to monitor the situa-tion in Ukraine and look ahead to the Fed minutes release,” Sevens Report’s Tom Essaye said in a note Wednesday morning.
*****
&gt; In the most recent geopolitical developments, NATO officials accused Russia of massing troops at the Ukrainian border.
*****
&gt; Energy prices, which have been sensitive to the news, moved sharply higher Wednesday morning, with natural gas up about 5% and oil prices climbing more than 1%.
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden addressed the latest developments between Russia and Ukraine Tuesday afternoon, reiterating that the U.S. will defend NATO territory.
*****
&gt; “If Russia proceeds, we will rally the world,” he said, adding that Washington’s allies were ready to impose powerful sanctions that will “undermine Russia’s ability to compete economically and strategically.”
*****
&gt; The comments came after the Russian government said earlier Tuesdayin the day that some troops who had been on the Ukrainian border had returned to their bases.
*****
&gt; This helped boost sentiment Tuesday on Wall Street. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury topped 2% as a risk-on tone returned to the market. Yields were little changed Wednesday, with the benchmark note slightly above 2%.
*****
&gt; The major averages advanced Tuesday, snapping a three-day losing streak. The Dow gained 422 points, or 1.2%. The S&amp;P added 1.58%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5%.
*****
&gt; Technology was the top-performing S&amp;P 500 sector, with nine out of the 11 groups registering gains on the day. Utilities and energy stocks were the two sectors in the red, dipping 0.6% and 1.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; “U.S. stocks rallied on optimism that it doesn’t seem like Russia will invade Ukraine this week and despite another hot PPI report, as many on Wall Street are still not convinced the Fed will be as aggressive as some are calling for this year,” said Oanda’s Ed Moya.
*****
&gt; The Labor Department said Tuesday that wholesale prices jumped 1% in January, bringing the gain over the past 12 months to 9.7% on an unadjusted basis.
*****
&gt; As inflation runs hot, Wall Street is looking ahead to the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, which will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.
*****
&gt; The summary could be viewed as stale considering the meeting happened before the most recent data. However, investors will be searching for any new insights into the number and size of rate hikes, as well as details of a balance sheet reduction plan.
*****
&gt; “The latest inflation data continue to decimate the ‘inflation is purely transitory’ theory,’” said Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
*****
&gt; “After pricing in less than one Fed hike as of last September, markets and Fed watchers now expect between 6 and 7 hikes over the next year, with some arguing for a 50 basis point move and not just 25,” Cembalest added.
*****
&gt; Retail sales data will also be released Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. on Wall Street. Economists are expecting the report to show that sales rose 2.1% in January. That compares to a 1.9% decline in December.

personalfinance,What to do With Remaining Student Loans?,"I'm sure there have been many posts about this topic - but I wanted to run my situation through to see if anyone has thoughts - and in case it helps other people as well:

The situation:

* Wife has \~$30k left on 7 different federal loans - consolidated into 1 relatively low monthly payment on an income-driven plan she put together before we were married.
* She works at a loan forgiveness-eligible institution
* We're about 2 years away from the TEPSLF forgiveness (if there's money left)
* I'm not interested in refinancing to quadruple the monthly payment to restart the clock back to 10 years for the PSLF forgiveness
* I never opted out of the payments during the pandemic so we could take advantage of the 0% interest.
* Loan forgiveness may or may not ever come broadly - and if it does I have a feeling we'll priced out from eligibility.

What would you do in our situation? We can pay if off now but that money could be used in far better investments. Should we take our chances there will be money available in 2 years from the TEPSLF fund? Just pay it off now? Just continue the low monthly payments until its done (though I hate seeing how much goes to interest)?

personalfinance,When does interest get applied on credit card debt? (Timing),"Hi, I'm wondering how credit card debt and interest works. I'm very responsible for my finances and always spend within my means and pay off credit card balances almost right away. 

However, due to an unforeseen circumstance recently, my spending is higher than usual. In terms of credit cards, the interest gets applied after the first month if not paid off? What if you made additional purchases couple weeks after, the interest on that gets applied after another week? Here's a scenario.

For example, lets say the billing cycle is on the 30th of the month. So you spent $1000 on June 1, then you spent $500 on June 14. But let's say by the 30th, you pay down the initial balance to $300, plus the $500. Total balance (on the 30th) would be $800. 

On or after the 30th, would the interest be applied on the $800 total balance? In other words, on whatever was spent and paid off in the last month. Or only on the initial balance (which is now $300), since it hasn't been one month since the second purchase? 

I guess in the end, I should pay off the entire balance no matter how uncomfortable it may be. Because interest rates for credit cards is like 20-30%",finance,1645026868.0

personalfinance,Is there something better I can do with my current financial setup to reduce the impact of taxes? (NY based working for NJ company; also worked for CT company last year),"Hi everyone! I have been a long-time reader of this subreddit and have tried to follow its core philosophy with utmost diligence.

**Here is where I currently stand, financially: -** 

I make 155k a year with a 20% bonus. There’s an annual equity payout of $40k vested quarterly over three years. I joined my current company last October, so I made 25k as a sign on bonus as well. Prior to that, I was on 143k with a 15% annual bonus for most of last year with my old company. Also, it was the best financial year in my career history since my old company paid me additional retention related bonuses to keep me whilst they underwent a sale. This talent retention program paid out 35k for me to stay until the sale successfully went through. Plus, I think everyone in the company got an additional 8k just to stay for that critical period (my extra bonus was exclusive). So, in summary, it turns out I made about $240k a year, gross (not considering company 401k and HSA matches).

I did what I could and maxed out (really close) my 401k and HSA (couldn’t contribute too much as company matches also count towards yearly limit). I was above the threshold to contribute to an IRA, Roth and Traditional. I automatically invest $4k a month into my Vanguard brokerage and buy the total stock market admiral fund. I put in money here and there into Robinhood when I try to maintain a healthy ratio between checking, savings and post-tax brokerage (I lean on the safer side, so I have 30k savings, 15k checking, and the rest is invested).

As far as net worth goes, I’m at about $350k. I just turned 30. I moved to America at 18 by myself under student visa. Went to a community college, then transferred to a city college and then graduated with a master’s from Cornell. I’ve been in NYC the whole time except for the 1 year in Ithaca (I wanted to have a nice “real” college experience albeit in grad school). Also managed to secure American citizenship in 2015 through the political asylum program (I owe America a lot). All in all, very happy.

**The deal with taxes... there’s got to be something I’m doing sub-optimally: -** 

My taxes are coming out to be 82k when taking federal, CT, NY and NJ returns into consideration. I had to file that many states since I live in NY and my old company was in Stamford and my new company is in NJ. I literally work from home all the time. I’m not paying for 3 states as they get aligned and credited when I file my tax returns. However, back to that 82k…. which is almost 40% of my total income. Isn’t that too much? I took the standard deduction, claimed 300 towards charity but besides that, I don’t own a house or a business to credit anything to. Is there anything else I can or should be doing? I analyzed and it turns out I’m paying about 7k just to be in NYC. Also, CT has this family leave thing outside what was withheld that came up to be 700 dollars. In contrast, I’d be paying over 25k less if I were in TX or Florida. This doesn’t feel good at all. On top of that I don’t even get to credit my student loan interests (not that I have one anymore), due to income restrictions.

**What I need help with on a high level: -**

Any ideas about how I can get the best of my current tax situation because honestly, I feel I’m being completely hammered filing as a single person with no dependents, businesses, or properties I can expense against. For example, I can I start a college fund for my future kid that’ll help with taxes being so high? Or if there are other tax friendly tools similar to the IRA and 401k that I can be utilizing at my income level? Or is it imperative for me to, for instance, start looking into starting a business so I can pour some of my hard earnings into a side project and nourish it to success, and have it provide some tax breaks on the side?

Above all, should I seriously consider buying a house? I live in this pretty little neighborhood in Brooklyn. Gf just moved in, so I pay 1200 and she chips in 700 for our quirky little, charming apartment that’s smallish but in an amazing neighborhood. She’s still in college so marriage or kids will be some years away. There is no way I can afford to purchase a house in the neighborhood of my choice, and I feel I’m still too young, and in a young relationship, to be looking to purchase a house in Jersey, Long Island or Upstate. That’s the reason I have zero hesitations with renting since being where I am physically is quite important to me at this stage in life. Should I consider rental properties out of state? If so, are they as tax friendly as the house you buy as your primary home of residence?

Thank you so much, guys. Appreciate any feedback.",finance,1645027910.0
stocks,Fed’s Harker backs small interest rate hike in March,"Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said Wednesday he wants a small interest rate hike in March and then methodical moves that don’t upset the economy’s strong performance. “I am very supportive of starting a process of raising the Fed funds rate, which is our primary tool of monetary policy, starting to raise that, and I would support as early as March a 25 basis point increase in that rate,” Harker said, in an interview with the WHYY radio station program “Radio Times.”

Many Wall Street economists have been talking about the possibility of a larger half percentage point rate hike in the wake of the strong 7.5% annual rate of consumer price inflation reached in January, the highest rate in 40 years. Investors think that a 50-basis point move is slightly more likely than a quarter-point move, according the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

Harker talked about moving Fed policy away from its easy stance in a methodical way without surprises. “We need to walk a fine line at the Fed. We need to do what we need to do to curb inflation but not overreact and possibly dampen an economy that is, in some ways, doing very well,” Harker said. “I think it is very clear the path we’re on in terms of policy. We will be raising interest rates. We will be reducing the size of our balance sheet. But we want to do that in a very methodical way – that is not surprising anyone,” he said.

Harker said it will take “a couple of years” to get inflation back to the central bank’s 2% target. “We would like to get back down and possibly go a little below that for a while just to try to average 2% over a period of time,” Harker said. “It’s going to take some time,” he added. Inflation is likely to be “north of 3.5%” this year.

Harker will be a voting member this year until University of Michigan economist Susan Collins, the incoming president of the Boston Fed, joins the central bank’s interest-rate committee in July.

CryptoCurrency,BlockFi hit with largest penalty against a crypto firm,"SEC Chair Gary Gensler watched one too many crypto commercials during the Super Bowl and decided to do something about it. On Monday, his agency said that crypto firm BlockFi would pay $100 million to the SEC and 32 states over charges that it had violated securities law. The penalty is the agency’s largest ever against a cryptocurrency company.

BlockFi, a banklike crypto company backed by Peter Thiel, didn’t admit or deny the SEC’s findings but did agree to stop opening new lending accounts to customers in the US.

So what led to the penalty? A timeline of events:

&amp;#x200B;

* BlockFi      amassed hundreds of thousands of users in the US by offering      interest-accruing crypto accounts.
* But      those accounts needed to be registered as a security with the SEC, which      the agency said BlockFi didn’t do.
* According      to the SEC, BlockFi misled users by downplaying the risk involved in such      accounts—the agency claims that if there were a run on assets, BlockFi      wouldn’t have been able to maintain interest rates or return crypto to      users.

In addition to paying the penalty, BlockFi plans to create and register a new crypto lending product called BlockFi Yield. As of December, the company’s assets totaled more than $10 billion.",cryptocurrency,1645029528.0

personalfinance,House Hacking - How does this look?,"Looking to buy my first home and really want to house hack. I’ve found a multi-unit home for sale and wanted some input.

House is a triplex listed at $450,000 near a pretty trendy area of town. 1 studio and 2 1br-1bth. All under current leases. Wife and I would take one of the 1br that is coming available soon. 

Here’s the breakdown:

Rental income: 
$26,400/yr ($1250 &amp; $950). 

Mortgage Payment: 
$19,956/yr ($1663/m) 
Doing $0 down with ~2% interest rate through family. 

Expenses:

Utilities: 
$4500/yr ($375/m)
All utilities are included in rent. Seller says the average is $125 per unit a month. 

Taxes:
$1822/yr (Tennessee)

Insurance: $1400/yr (?) not sure

Total Expenses: $7722/yr
Expenses + Mortgage: $27,678

So $26,400-$27,678= -$1,278/yr

So by my calculations it would cost me $106.50 a month to live here. Figured i could also set aside $500 or so a month for a repair/vacancy fund. Ideally I could negotiate the purchase price down, but we’ll see. Is my math solid?

Total cost for a 7.9kw system is $38k. Minus the federal tax credit, it comes to around $29k, which brings my payment to $110/month, which conveniently is right around what my average electricity bill is, currently.

To me, it seems like they looked at my energy bill, figured out how to get my monthly payment so that it's right at that level, then added another $9k to the total. That way they get to pitch it as ""your payment stays the same, and you get the benefits of solar! Leaving out the fact that this is only true if I apply the entire tax credit to pay for the install.

From doing a bit of google-sleuthing, it seems like $38k is waaaay higher than it should be. Am I off base here?

I have another company coming out to do another estimate, for comparison purposes. But they're also asking me for my electric bill, and I'm afraid it's gonna be the same scam. It makes me want to say eff it and just keep paying the devil I already know (Dominion).",energy,1645035558.0

I raised this with HR and they just replied ""Your W-2 may not match because we changed payroll companies part way through the year"" and then closed the case.

Every previous year if I take my final payslip for the year and look at the ""FED TAXABLE GROSS"" box then it matches box 1 on my W-2, to within $1-10. The fed taxable gross on my payslip is perfectly gross pay minus pre-tax deductions such as health insurance, dental, and 403b contributions. The pre-tax deductions are about $4000 each year.

This year the figure in my W-2 box 1 is $7000 **higher** than ""FED TAXABLE GROSS"" from my December 2021 payslip. So not only is it not reporting the pre-tax deduction, its saying I earned more than I did. It's like they added the pre-tax deductions rather than subtracting, but that doesn't fit either. In fact, the box 1 is actually $3000 higher than my gross salary for the year, and the W-2 has a little note section where it says what my gross salary was for the year and its $5000 more than I earned.

Am I crazy? Is there something i'm missing? Is there a way I can articulate this inconsistency to HR and if they don't play ball and actually recalculate rather than giving a copy+paste stock answer is there a way I can force them to recalculate?

inflation,Inflation is One of our Government's Few Successes! Part II,"How is inflation caused by our government?   Note:  ""Our"" government is not meant to imply that it responds to our wishes or works for our benefit.  I meant ""our"" as in ""our rulers"".  We do not live in a democracy.

Inflation is caused by the creation of deposits by the Federal Reserve Bank in the reserves of the major US banks.   The Fed does not create deposits in the accounts of students, workers, mortgagees, people who really need the funds and would put them into circulation immediately.  No!  The Fed increases the reserves of banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo,  Bank of America, and others that caused the crisis of 2008, to enable them to make very low cost loans to major corporations.   Those corporations do not spend the funds on productivity improvement or developing new products and services that would employ people.   They spend at the stock market, buying back their shares and thereby increasing the price of them.    This has no ""multiplier"" effect, and serves only to increase the bonuses of their executives as share prices rise.  Thus, the amount of goods and services produced does not rise.

The Fed also ""prints"" money to fund the federal budget deficit.  The military received an unaudited  $787 billion, this year, and with the intelligence agencies well over a trillion dollars has gone to so-called ""defense"".   The printing of money to fund the deficit does get into circulation and it competes for the supply of goods that has not been increased.   This causes prices to rise,  inflation.  In addition, the supply of goods has fallen due to COVID19, adding fuel to the inflation fire.   Then,  in order to improve its political image, the White House distributed $1,400 to every adult citizen.   Inflation was  not rising fast enough to suit the Fed and the White House!

personalfinance,Don't be me. Look at your W4 for state and fed after you get new job,"So when I started this job in July of 2020 I filled 1 with an additional $50 each paycheck for my state taxes(MD). Sent it to my HR assuming it was handled. The first year I owed but I though it was from when I was on unemployment during covid so I didn't think anything of it and paid. It was only about $400. That's still alot but I accepted it because unemployment never takes out enough taxes. 

In August 2021 I noticed an extra $74 was suddenly getting taken out of my check and found out that when they switched payroll systems it only just started taking out local county tax. I figured it would probably balance out.

Fast forward to a getting my W2 and putting it into turbo tax. I almost had a heart attack. I owed a little over 1k. I didn't understand how it had happend. I was confused and thought maybe it was because I made more than I've ever made and I was in a new tax bracket (make a little over 76k gross but 68k net). 

After I was done having an absolute panic I called the head of my HR and was like I dont understand what's happened Come to find out when the lady, who no longer works there, filed my MW507 she didn't put 1 and an additional $50. She just put one. It's now been fixed but holy crap it's a mess. I hung up the phone with the head of HR and after a while I remembered about the local county tax. I did the math and lo and behold thats where the 1k came from. Which also means that if they hadn't changed their payroll I probably would have at least broke even. Honestly there is nothing I can do about but pay it but I figured I'd share my story because that kind of hole is difficult. I'm sure this isn't a normal thing for most employers but mine is technically out of state working in my state and I'd rather make sure no one else goes through this if I can help it.

personalfinance,Co-Sign or Single Applicant for auto loan?,"I'm nearing my reservation date for a Tesla Model Y Perf, and need to secure financing as part of the final steps for delivery.

For previous vehicles, the names on the registration had no bearing with the names on the loan.  That is to say, I could finance the vehicle alone and have the vehicle registration listed with myself and my (now) spouse.

For Tesla, they require all the names on the vehicle registration to also be present on the financing documents.

My question then is: Should I finance alone, or should I list my spouse on both the financing and the registration?

Why it matters: Mostly, I think it shouldn't matter.... but I wanted to make sure I'm not overlooking something. My wife and I have 810+ credit scores and our combined gross household income is 4x the amount of the loan, so we should qualify either way without issue.

My wife is on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program which has payments set under the Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plan.  This has already caused us a few problems because we have to file Married-Filing-Separate so we can avoid her federal loan payments going from \~$200/month up to \~$900/month due to my salary if we filed jointly. It also threw a wrench in our plans because I had contributed the max to a ROTH IRA in JAN2021 and we got married in JUL2021, but if you file taxes as ""Married Filing Separate"" and make more than $10k per year you are **not allowed to contribute** to a ROTH IRA (grrrrr). So I'm trying to preemptively ensure I've considered other potential implications here.

\---

If we apply for the loan together, would that potentially affect her IDR plan payments?

We will also likely be getting another vehicle (teen graduating next year) and/or upgrading our current vehicle soon-ish... so I wonder about future loans.

Would it be better to apply jointly for financing (and she gets to be on the registration) or to just do this more expensive vehicle alone, so that it doesn't impact her credit score and/or so she can apply alone (or jointly) for a less expensive vehicle within the next two years?

Is this a weird Tesla thing?  Can I just add her to the registration after-the fact when I go to renew the registration with the DMV?

\---

*note: having her be on the registration isn't really necessary for any reasons I can think of.  She's not offended by being ""excluded"" in this sense, and has had to deal with it already because I bought the house under a VA loan before we were married and she wasn't allowed to even be on the loan/title. She'll actually be the main driver of this vehicle either way.*",finance,1645044521.0

personalfinance,Refinancing mixed use property to get some investment cash?,"So I have this odd situation.  I purchased a house which has a commercial property attached to it.  Because of this dual zoning, it made it impossible to appraise.  Therefore when I bought it, we just through out the number $160,000 and the banker went with it.

I paid like $40,000 down and got a mortgage on the rest and am paying around $900/month.  (Don't do the math because I'm estimating these numbers from memory.)

Anyway, we recently rented the commercial part of it for $1,350/month.  We've also been paying these mortgage payments for about 4 years.

I have an opportunity to buy a tract of land which I'd like as an investment.  It costs $99,000 but we can probably talk them down a bit.  I just don't want to spend all that from my savings and so I'm wondering if refinancing might be an option to get some quick cash in this situation.

Also, given that I'm now renting the commercial property, could we use that to suggest a higher valuation on the property being refinanced so that we'd have more equity available?  Again, appraising might be an issue so we'd basically have to convince the banker of its value and I think having the rent agreement could help with that.  (We've also done some renovations in both the commercial and residential spaces, about $50,000 worth.)

inflation,How To Counter Inflation Without Raising the Interest Rate,"How To Counter Inflation Without Raising the Interest Rate:

Raising the interest rate seems to me like it would have the opposite effect on inflation than what we are trying to do. Increasing the interest rate makes money more expensive to borrow. Which to me means that money will go less far because of the back end expense of the increased interest that gets added on. 10K becomes closer to 9k working capital at 10% interest. So that 10K only has the purchasing power of 9K. That decreased the value of the dollar.

So what will work? Price ceilings… The government can impose price ceilings on gas and eggs and other things that have significantly been impacted by inflation and then subsidize those industries for their potential profit loss. We can end subsidized payments to farmers for them not to farm their land which has held the price of produce high. In addition, empty land without green vegetation growing on it does not reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, so the government pays farmers to make our lives harder by not farming.

These are simple changes that could be made that would work. But we have a government that has been controlled by 1 man for the past 20 years who is controlled/owned by a Chinese woman. That Chinese woman has done everything in her power to stop the growth of America and instead has tried to dismantle the country at its foundation. That Chinese woman has controlled the direction of this country for far too long, but Kentucky voters are not educated enough to understand these simple things so the problem continues.

Stop China’s control over our government. Kentucky’s senator is controlled by China. Fix this one problem first and all the other problems will become fixable including inflation.",finance,1645051878.0

XRP,My XRP cointest entry for r/cc,"Ripplenet = / = XRP Ledger, for some reason a lot of people cant grasp the distinction between the two.  Ripple is a business that has the largest stake in the XRP ecosystem. 
At one time many years ago the negative arguments that people seem unwilling to let go of were true. The ledger was centralized around a core of high-end enterprise-grade nodes. It was a design choice of Ripple in creating the decentralized XRPL to start with the most robust open quorum BFT network they could devise from the get-go. Which makes sense because the market they chose for XRPs biggest use case the interbank liquidity markets is the largest most regulated market in the world.

They didn't finance the construction of the ledger with sales of XRP. They financed the creation of the ledger through traditional VC funding rounds. There is a long paper trail that proves this. They don't sell Xrp below market rates just to make a buck. This is an erroneous FUD because of the R3 Ripple deal that went to court. They did sell into the secondary markets but completely stopped when the wash trading controversy happened a few years ago where volumes were spoofed across most exchanges. So selling by volume hurt the market so they stopped.

They built the XRP ledger with plans in place to decentralize  over time and completely release it into the wild when the community had grown enough around its use that a shepherd was no longer needed. This is still in progress but close to completion we are in stage 3 currently. In stage 4 it will be 0 control. There are now several UNLs published by stake holders that have as little as 30-40% overlap with Ripples published UNL. 

The biggest reason why I support XRP and by extension Ripple is because Ripplenet the suite of Ripple software and the permissioned public liquidity network built on top of the XRPL is designed to fix a lot of the problems inherent in our financial system. The interbank liquidity markets are owned +80% by just a handful of US banks. They are private monopolies that completely control the largest markets in the world. When a small or medium-sized financial institution creates interest bearing financial products they're immediately sold into the interbank markets where they go up the food chain to the largest banks. They receive monthly payments on this debt, creating a web of interconnected debt obligations throughout our financial system. The big banks then make leveraged plays with their massive portfolios and it doesn't end well. I.e. Lehman Bros and subprime MBS's. when one central counterparty can no longer make their payments then the system crashes because no one makes payments, liquidity dries up and millions of innocent people lose their homes.  The interdependencies in the US financial system that caused 2008 are still present.

Ripple is one of the few companies in the world with an answer to the counter party risk problem. A public liquidity network designed for banking usage. For small and medium-sized institutions can keep performing assets on their books by accessing liquidity for pennies on the dollar compared to the traditional system. This completely removes interdependencies in the system.  The large banks won't be able to run to the FED and cry poor mouth an too big to fail. The FED will say tough shit go source liquidity in the open market.

XRPs value will be determined by utility, it price will increase with volume expansion and increasing velocity. If it becomes legally usable for the interbank liquidity markets CHIPS, CLS International, CME Clearing, DTC, FICC, ICC, NSCC, and OCC. The volume from just one of these markets would eclipse all of crypto several times over, hundreds of times for a few of them.

These make up the US financial market infrastructures which most of the world is begrudgingly dependent on. They are the most liquid in the world. These systems are private monopolies, companies, and banks that provide critical services to the financial system. The FED operates some of financial liquidity markets for interbank market operations supporting liquid markets and preventing a market-wide collapse from a domino effect of a single too big to fail, failing. Like 2008,  Ripple has support from global financial regulators like the IMF, the FED, and BIS. Because it removes interdependencies inherent in the system. This is also why Ripple is facing so much opposition in the US. It's directly challenging the most powerful organizations in the world. US banks, If it's successful it will end the largest monopolies to ever exist.

XRPL itself is having a renaissance with almost 100 new projects since the beginning of the year and major ledger upgrades for federated sidechains, NFTs XLS 20, novel automated markets without arbitrage, hooks which are on devnet now, VM's, smart contracts, the launch of the utility Fork Flare, CBDC's.

We're in NJ PSEG (about 17c per k/w all in)

Typically 1000 kw (between April-October  avg 1500 kw)

\-

Proposed (13.00 KW DC)

40 x JA Panels 325 watts 

2 x Solar Edge Inverter

Generate est. 12,694kw

91% General Est.

Total Cost of system - $52,204 (2.99 APR) 

Federal Credit - $13,573   \*Not sure if this is an actual refund, or a credit?

Net Cost $38,986

Payments are $186 per month, assuming I fork over the Federal Credit

Salesman mentioned SREC2 credits (NJ) are $90 per 1000kw, 

It could potentially workout under $96 if system generates.

Does this make sense?

Any recommendations on other Solar Companies (if need be)

personalfinance,Go through dealership or bank for auto loan?,"UPDATE: I found a great local bank I've wanted to work with. Their rate is 2.27% - I think I'd be closer to 4% at the dealership. The only kicker is that they want me to take out a min amount, which is roughly $15K over. I could use the money, but I guess I'd want to know if there was a prepay penalty. Right? 

\-------

My lease ends in March. I plan on buying/financing the car. My dealership has a relationship with Chase bank, as do I; my lease is through Chase as well.

Is there a difference between going with one over the other? Curious whether one direction generally yields a better interest rate?

Thank you!

personalfinance,TurboTax Deluxe vs H&amp;R Block Premium,"I just filed my taxes through TurboTax Deluxe (TT) that I purchased at Costco for $40 and was curious what the difference between H&amp;R Block (HRB) was as they had some seemingly better prices. The Premium has gone on sale for $25 occasionally.

Long story short they both came up with about the same refund. TT was $5,949 refund while HRB had $5,947. 

TT was going to cost $60 to efile both Fed and California, with an option to print out and mail in California to save the $20 efile fee. HRB was going to cost $87 for the Premium Fed and CA efile on their website with *NO* option to mail in state to save their $37 state fee. If you didn't want to pay the $37 state fee you had to completely redo your return by hand and mail it in. HRB bumped me up to premium because of a small $66 capital gain on foreign currency and a $32 capital loss on a sale of a stock. TT deluxe let me enter those in without an extra upgrade fee.

HRB was easier to enter info as they have a drag and drop feature that TT didn't have. For instance in TT my wife's payroll company isn't supported by their import service so I have to type it in manually each time. HRB easily did it with a drag and drop. That feature also found an $8 dividend that I didn't enter in TT. If anyone thinks I should amend my return over $8 let me know.

I haven't decided yet who I'll use next year but if you can get a deal on HRB premium for $25 like Newegg had recently and pay the $37 for state efile it comes out to almost the exact same as TT, $62 vs $60. I may switch to HRB next year just for the easier data entry.",finance,1645063462.0

personalfinance,[31] Trying to maximize my saving and investing while I finish grad school. Can I get some advice on my current financial standing?,"I'll be finishing my master's in engineering by the end of the summer. Here is a breakdown of my current financial situation:

Monthly Income:

Grad funding (after tax): $2000

eBay/Social media side income: $100

Monthly Expenses

Rent + Utilities: $750

Gasoline: $150

Groceries/food: $350

Medical expenses (drugs, co-pays): $100

School fees: $200

Non-essential spending: $100

Savings:

Bank account: $16k

Rothe IRA: $19-20k

Individual brokerage: $26K

Side income brokerage: $1k

Debts:

Federal student loan: $5500 (In-school and not accruing interest)

I was able to max out my Roth IRA for the last three years using the money I was given from my family as a graduation gift. The rest of the money I have invested in my brokerage accounts is money I've saved from my grad assistantships and from small side businesses selling seeds and specialty plants over the last few years. I've always been addicted to saving money since I was a very young child. I remember obsessively counting the money I had made doing chores around the house as far back as when I was 6-years-old. Every time I buy ETF shares, it gives me a little dopamine hit. My investments are spread out evenly across the following ETFs:

VOO

QQQ

VONG

I don't buy single stocks or crypto.

My student loan has not accrued any interest. I was hoping Biden would forgive it, but that doesn't look like it's going to happen. I figured I'd let inflation eat it up while I'm still in school and the student loan moratorium is still in effect. Once that ends, I'll use my savings to pay it all off immediately.

Once I graduate, I will likely start earning in the range of $80k/year. based on what grads from my program have told me. A friend is talking with a company right now for a job in my industry, so I'm trying to better hone in on an expected salary range.

Based on my current financial standing, what would you all recommend I do, financially, going forward? I'm basically saving everything I can right now. After I get a job, my expenses shouldn't go up much more since my car is paid for. My understanding is that I can contribute to my 401K and Roth IRA at the same time, so I plan on doing that once I start working. I'd like to continue saving as much as possible in my non-retirement investment account so that I can start a business if the opportunity arises or buy a modest home with cash.",finance,1645064571.0

Mine is mostly correct, and I only owe a few hundred in taxes for my income.~~ edit: sounds like I'm the one who goofed, not her.

What would you do in our situation? Is it wise to pay it all at once using emergency funds? Should we try and settle for less? Should we wait until April and try to save hard before talking to them at all? Does the IRS charge interest on payment plans, if we set one up?

Getting the inheritance required a lot of legal services that depleted my savings so I’m planning to keep $25,000 as a 6 month savings safety net. 

Option 1: Pay off private student loans which is about $63k. Interest rate is a little over 3%. I pay about 1070/month (22% of my take home pay) on this. I would take that money and max out my Roth IRA and HSA contributions every year ($6000 for IRA and $3650 for HSA) and would still have $270 left. 

Option 2:  Invest all the money between additional contributions to my traditional 401k, Roth IRA, HSA, and a brokerage account. 

I’m currently leaning towards option 1 as my loans take a nice chunk of my income ($103k/year) and it’s a mental relief to me eliminating this debt. I know mathematically option 2 is probably the better long term route however. With either option I’m planning to pursue an online masters degree that’ll cost me about $10k and pay off my credit card $7k. I currently meet my employer match for my 401k.

personalfinance,19 Year Old College Student - Need Advice on Financing a Car,"Please forgive me if this background is not properly done for this sub, but I'll try to give as much relevant information as possible to give you the gist of where I'm at.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student on the cusp of finishing up with my Associate's Degree, and things seem to be looking up for me in many respects except one - it has to do with my car situation. Up until now, I've been dependent on my family for money, food, what car to drive, yada yada. While I appreciate what I have, I have so many reasons why I cannot continue with my current situation. I borrow my dad's car, as well as my mother's, and they're both old and at that stage in the life of a car when things start to come apart (170,000+ miles). They're not car people, and these have not been well maintained. The problem is that whenever something goes wrong with these vehicles - it's because I did something. Doesn't matter what the problem may be, even if it's a simple issue of wear and tear, I did it. Whenever something goes wrong with them, an explosive argument ensues. It's a stressful burden to be carrying around, never mind other worries I have in life. I feel like my independence, however illusory it may be in my case, is resting on a knife edge.

&amp;#x200B;

As of last year, however, I've taken up a retail job along with my classes. I work up to 40 hours currently making $11 an hour. I feel confident that this is not a job that I will suddenly be ejected from - it's a stable situation, in other words. They're understanding of my situation as a student. All my coworkers and managers like and appreciate my working with them, and I feel like one of the family now. I was even told I can hope for a bump up in pay within the next couple of months if I keep doing good. I make over $1,500 a month before tax (I've read somewhere that it works against you if your monthly income is below that amount), and I take home $1,400 (assuming I work a minimum of 37 hrs a week for that month). So far, I have no debt of any kind. I have never had an accident, or even been pulled over/ticketed in the three years that I've been driving. After I finish with my 2 year degree, I plan to go to university here in my hometown. On the other hand, I don't have a credit history. I really do regret not working on my credit earlier, but ""should have's"" aren't very helpful to anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

If more information is needed in this vein, I can continue. I don't come from a healthy family background. I don't mind living with my parents since I'm saving money, but I just can't go on indebted to them in this way. I feel troubled, not just because of my car situation alone, but that's my most immediate concern. I don't want to drone on and on, giving you an endless sob story, but I hope you understand where I'm coming from at least. My initial plan was to keep saving up this semester and through the summer so that I'd have enough to pay a hefty sum down on a new car, but frankly I'm tired of feeling anxiety over this. I've gotten sufficiently fed up that I'm willing to consider putting myself in debt over this. I'm not too proud, or picky, though I had my heart set on either a Mazda3, a Civic, or an Accord. I wouldn't mind a used car, but I'm not a car person either, so I feel wary and unconfident towards this option.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this isn't the smart course of action to take, but I can't help feeling the rush of urgency. I'm willing to just suck it up, pinch my pennies, and continue with my original plan of saving up so that I don't have to put myself in the red - but it seems to me that having my own car is important enough that taking a loan out on one feels justified.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I can put down $5.5K. Based on all the information I've just given you, what should I do? Should I just keep my head down, pray, and stick with my initial plan, or should I try to get an auto loan? If the latter, do I have enough to satisfy a potential creditor? I don't pretend to know how these things are done, less still the nuances, so you just have to please excuse the naivete of my questions. I just want to be steered in the right direction. I recognize that simply ""having my own car"" doesn't mean that I won't run into issues myself, but I would at least be holding myself accountable for it. It would be my own business, and I wouldn't have to keep putting up with what feels like a humiliating, and maybe even degrading circumstance for myself.",finance,1645077612.0

So I want to share with you Fed Fund Futures. They're futures contracts that trade on the CME and from those futures we can see to what degree of probability the market has priced in different Fed interest rate policies. 

[Investing.com](https://Investing.com) has a real convenient Fed Rate Monitor derived from these futures [https://www.investing.com/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor](https://www.investing.com/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor)

[Market predictions Fed funds rate](https://preview.redd.it/gly1jj3elci81.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ddde3912eb64494d3cd22ca7a87caaa6ba73c11)

We can see that for March the market has priced in a rate hike to 0.25% with 100% probability, or confidence. And a rate hike to 0.25% should not move any markets as its fully priced in. There's a not insignificant possibility that the the fed will hike rates to 0.5-0.75% If the fed did move to target rates there, personally, I would expect markets to correct a little to the downside since the futures markets have only priced in a 33.7% probability of the fed hiking rates to within that range. But we can still see it is within the realm of reasonable expectations.

Now I think there's one caveat with crypto. Its still primarily a retail driven market and I'm not sure of its ability to price in things from established markets. If your curious how fed rate hikes effect crypto markets I would suggest using this tool, then look and see what happens when rates are announced, look at what the probabilities are, and you'll be able to answer to what degree crypto markets currently do price in federal reserve interest rate policy expectations.

If you find this useful I wouldn't mind a few moons thrown my way.

personalfinance,Help me save my house reddit.,"For context: Back in late 2019 I decided to buy a house for me and my fiancé on the promise we would split the bills.. I bought the modest house for 155k with a decently low interest of 2.5%. I had really good credit 780, a small lone left to pay  about 6k and my car payment of 420$ a month. With both our salaries it would have been more then doable. 
Once I closed on the house, my partners mother had a stroke, so naturally I told her to take care of her and don't worry about the house for now. I moved in bought some appliances and put them on my credit card thinking my fiance would move in and I would just pay it off. 

The fall of my finances: Fast forward 6 months later, my partner still hasn't moved in despite her mother fully recovering. I am paying this 1200$ mortgage plus utility's, my car payment and my loan solo. With my salary it's too much, I began buying food on the credit card , the fridge broke so I put that on the card (cheapest one I could find). At this point I reach a tipping point. My credit card interest payments are too high, I cant and couldn't sustain the house alone and the longer I waited the deeper I was getting. Eventually I started alternating car payments with debt payments, eventually this led to my car getting repoed causing me to have to pay what I owed plus another 300$ repo fee equaling 1200$ total. I borrowed with a pension loan, a no interest loan (since I'm a state worker) but I would have to pay this money back from my pay. 

The last ditch effort: After all of this I left my fiancé, I had no trust in her since she left me high and dry after convincing me to take this financial risk. I asked my brother to move in and help with the bills, at this point I was 2 months late on my mortgage. I call the bank and try to get a refinance on the house I was afraid I was about to be foreclosed on.. They respond with a very promising prospect; appraise the house, refinance with cash out use that to pay all my debts including my car they I can just focus on the mortgage and utilities while my credit score recovers. Only down side is my brother would have to co sign. He has a job working at the same schools district as me and we have a very good relationship so I didn't see and issue. The appraisal came back much lower then anticipated though, and since it was such a high risk refinance they will not go above 80% of what the house is worth. This will not pay for anything and has a much higher interest rate

What I'm asking: I want to save my house some how and here is the situation.

Funds: I make  2000 $ a month, and another 400$ for VA disability (I'm a vet)

My brother can pay: 600$ a month. 

What I owe: 

I'm 6,270.83$ behind on my mortgage

Discover Bank         $   16,226.00 (credit card)
PNC Bank                $    9,014.00 (car)
Upstart Network    $    9,497.00

personalfinance,"Early 401k withdraw , rollover to Roth IRA, taxed at 100%?","Hi, thank you in advance and let me further explain the title.

I worked at a job for a little over a year and left it for another. They had a 401k for me and contributed to it but did not tell me about it. It ended up with ~$1000. I received a letter in the mail about it, and when I found out I was pissed and wanted to consolidate it with my Roth IRA. I spoke with multiple people at the former employers financial institution (American funds) and my Roth IRA institution (Vanguard) to assure this was the right thing to do. They of course warned me it would be taxed anywhere from 10-30%. Not my invested money, don't care, I want to consolidate, cool.

Tax szn rolls around. I make $36500 a year, no kids, no home, no major deductions. I use TurboTax and mark the rollover ($934 after the first tax) . My estimated federal refund went from $900 to me owing money. I've messed around with the deductions and this is the only variable. I haven't submitted them yet.

personalfinance,Lost trying to decide if I should refinance. Desperate for help.,"Desperately trying to figure out if I should refinance. After reading what feels like 100 Reddit posts, articles and forums, I am more lost than when I started. Our loan was sold 3 times and is now held by Mr. cooper. 


Current loan:

Purchase price: 398,000 in 08/2019

30 year fix @ 3.99%.

Monthly payment when we started: 2,160

Due to not being informed about filing for homestead and mortgage exemptions, our property taxes doubled and current monthly payment is 2.686. ( nothing i can do about this now except file for next year. lesson learned...unless anyone has advice on this.)

We also pay 300 extra a month towards the principal.

Total monthly payment: 2,986


Proposed refi loan:

Unpaid principal: 331, 254

Current appraised value of home: 450,000

New interest rate: 3.5%

New monthly payment 2,290


Full closing cost break down including discount points: (provided by lender Mr. cooper)

Estimated Prepaid Items $6,375  (whole new escrow account and other yearly charges already paying)

Estimated Closing Costs $2,769   (the $1k we charge and other things like sales tax and such)

Those are then added to $9,144

Subtract the escrow rollover $2,738 (you already have money in your account)

 And you are left with closing costs of $6,406

Now you add the Discount Points $7,157 (the upfront costs to buy the rates down from Fannie and Freddie)

The total cost of the loan is now $13,563 (this is then added to the loan value so you aren’t paying costs out of pocket)

investing,Confusion about capital flow due to IR differential,"So as per theory, when there is interest rate differential, say right now when we expect US Interest rates to go up and emerging market rates to remain where they are in countries like Indonesia, India, China etc., we expect capital to flow from these EM countries to the US.

What I dont understand is this:   
1. The above assertion is true in the case when investors were interested only in fixed income products. So US bonds, treasuries, etc., will become cheaper with higher rates, and they're safer so they're better options than EM fixed income products.   
2. But if you look at risk assets like equities, they'd perform poorly in US because of higher interest rates since credit will become expensive, and higher inflation is already punishing consumers and affecting their buying power. So for equity, EM might perform way better than the US.   

So   
1. why would investors not prefer shifting capital from US equities to EM equities?   
2. Wouldn't that somewhat offset the effect of capital flowing from EM fixed income to US fixed income?   
3. I see FIIs selling off their equity portfolio in EM markets, which I find a little confusing.   

One reason to explain FIIs selling off Indian equities is that Indian listed companies might be dependent on US companies for revenues since India is a net exporter, so that ripple effect might touch them as well. Secondly, if a lot of fixed income capital flows out of India, that will cause the INR to depreciate in front of the dollar, and net equity returns for international investors in dollar terms will go down. But this seems like an insignificant factor.",finance,1645108975.0

defi,Borrowing from crypto to buy a house,"Someone was talking to me about borrowing from their crypto portfolio to buy a house, It seemed interesting and I just wanted to understand more about it as maybe it's something I might consider.

What the plan is:

1. Take $1,000,000 to fund a stablecoin LP.
2. Take the Stablecoin LP and put it up as collateral on something like Abracadabra (if they ever had MIM available) or defrost. and borrow about $900,000 in the platform's stablecoin.
3. Sell that stablecoin for USD, and use that USD to buy a house.
4. You have a $900,000 house, and a $1,000,000 LP token still earning fees that you can use to pay down the loan.

What are the risks here? It seems that if the LP goes to hell, you still have your $900,000 house. You just lose the $100,000 extra bit of excess collateral. If this has been going fine for a period, maybe the interest earned has covered the excess collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

**Specific Questions**

What exactly happens to my LP Token when I post it as collateral? Does it get transferred to the lending platform? Is it possible that I could be unfairly liquidated?

How do I receive earnings on LP Tokens I post as collateral?

I know the rate I'm earning on the LP could be variable, but is the interest rate of the borrowing fixed? 

What are the risks of being liquidated if I'm posting a stablecoin LP token as collateral?

**If things are all good, I'm imagining at the extreme I could sell all my real world items for LP-Tokens, borrow against the LP token, buy most of it back, and still earn on the LP token. Practically earning on double the asset base.**",cryptocurrency,1645109593.0

CryptoCurrency,"ADALend CEO Kaspars Koskins: “ $100M fine for BlockFi, Canada banking freeze highlights the importance of Decentralized Finance”","Welcome to the second installment of our interview series with the ADALend CEO Kaspars Koskins. Recent events in the US and Canada have illustrated that Decentralized Finance is more important than ever before. ADALend is at the vanguard of this revolution in the lending industry by using blockchain technology to disintermediate the traditional middlemen – providing unprecedented access to loans for those ignored by the traditional banking system and providing high yields for investors in a persistent low-interest-rate environment.

Moreover, as we have seen dramatic overreach from the SEC in the US and the Canadian government, Decentralized Finance platforms have become more important than ever to protect the wealth of ordinary citizens. We were overwhelmed with positive feedback after the last interview with Kasparas, so without further adieu, let’s begin.

**Interviewer:** ***Welcome back Kasparas, in our last interview we discussed deeply the value that ADALend provides for the middle classes in the western world as well as emerging markets. For those of our audience that missed it, can you summarize the ADALend value proposition?***

**Koskins:**  Certainly, first let me just say it’s great to be back here. The passionate ADALend community loved our last interview and we touched on many topics that resonated with them and attracted many other like-minded folks to join us. Today we are going to go even deeper philosophically into why Cardano and decentralized financial systems are more important than ever, and how recent events in the US, Canada and even Russia are highlighting this. However, first let me recap the ADALend vision and mission as you wisely suggested.

Here at ADALend we are developing a scalable, trustless, and decentralized lending protocol that protects its users within a self-governed environment. From our earliest inception, we committed to build natively on the Cardano blockchain, which will enable the lending platform to aggregate protocols that support business models that give economic support to billions of users. ADALend will bring back the balance of power between lenders and borrowers. By allowing the use of digital assets as collateral, the use of the platform will be diversified to the benefit of the user.

We chose to build on the Cardano blockchain as Ethereum is no longer usable by the majority of people on the planet due to the high transaction costs – with gas fees reaching into the hundreds of dollars per transaction. This is unacceptable to ordinary people in the western world today as well as the millions of unbanked people in the developing countries of Africa and Asia lending and borrowing far smaller amounts. Ethereum is now only usable by the already wealthy, while new platforms like Solana and Avalanche have problems with centralization, security and reliability. Cardano is the only truly decentralized blockchain with the required security, speed and low transaction fees required to provide a truly democratic financial solution that can be used by every human on planet earth.

As I mentioned in our last interview – the ADALend vision aligns perfectly with that of Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson who is passionate about improving financial outcomes for people all over the world, regardless of race, nationality, gender or financial status.

**Interviewer:** ***Thank you for the summary Kaspars, it’s truly impressive what you and your team are building***\*.\* ***Offline we were talking about the BlockFi SEC fine and the Canadian government’s actions against the Trucker’s protests.  What do these events have in common and can you share more about how they relate to the ADALend mission?***

**Koskins:** Absolutely, in recent weeks we have seen the  SEC fining BlockFi $100 million US dollars for providing a decent interest rate to its users; Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken the unprecedented step of invoking the Emergencies Act to crack down on anti-vaccine mandate protests.by freezing their bank accounts; and Western leaders threaten to cut Russia off from the SWIFT banking system if they invade Ukraine. Now, regardless of your political opinion on these events, they highlight how governments and institutions can, at their convenience, cut ordinary people out from earning interest on their savings,  accessing their savings or transferring money internationally. I am old enough to remember when in 2013 the government of Cyprus decided to unilaterally impose a 10% “haircut” on bank accounts to bail themselves out after the financial crises and literally unlawfully stole the money from people’s accounts. This was my conversion moment that we need to protect individuals hard-earned wealth from overreaching governments and began my journey into Bitcoin, then Cardano and ultimately the desire to build a truly decentralized financial system,

With a Decentralized Financial platform like ADAlend, people can earn a good interest rate on their hard-earned savings without worrying about the risks of the Government attacking the platform as they did with a centralized crypto lender like BlockFi or the government trying to freeze your bank account if they don’t agree with your opinions or peaceful protest like they did in Canada. DeFi systems are by their very definition more robust and antifragile than centralized companies like BlockFi. The ADAlend protocol and network is more akin to Bitcoin or Cardano whereas the network scales it will become more robust to attack.

In parallel to the completely decentralized ADALend protocol and core platform, we are exploring offering regulated centralized lending services in each jurisdiction that we operate in. These will offer slightly lower interest rates and yields than on the ADALend decentralized staking and liquidity provision platform, but still far far higher than any bank or credit union. This is because we understand that while our crypto-native community members are comfortable investing the time and energy to interact with DeFi protocols, we have mature users as well – business owners, doctors, lawyers, and self-employed tradesmen who simply don’t have time to live online.

For these hardworking people, we will provide high-interest rates on stablecoin and crypto savings, in a highly regulated environment. We are working with the regulators on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis – beginning with my home market of the European Union with an Estonian entity, followed by the United Kingdom with a London HQ, and then United Arab Emirates, with a regulated entity in the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC). Next on the roadmap will be the US and Canada so we are watching and learning from the experiences of BlockFi, Nexo Celsius and others as we plan our market entry.  We believe that to truly recolutionalise finance you need to disrupt the system from inside and out,  and this is why we have adopted a two-pronged strategy of rolling out a DeFi protocol and a CeFi business in parallel globally.

**Interviewer:** ***Thank you Kasparas, it’s tremendously exciting to hear how your mission is evolving over time and how each misstep and overreach by governments only makes the ADALend value proposition more compelling and essential to protect the hard-earned savings of ordinary, hard-working  people all over the world.***

***So to move from the philosophical and strategic to the tactical, let’s roll up our sleeves and talk about how you and the guys are executing this mission in the trenches. How is the commercial and technical work progressing?*** 

**Koskins:** Thank you for the kind words, yes it’s both exciting and frightening to see how the macro events in the news make the ADALend mission ever more vital each time we speak. It truly strengthens our resolve and motivates the team that we have chosen a worthy goal to focus on: providing financial inclusion, security and wealth protection for savers and investors of all sizes.

On the technical side, we have strengthened our development team with a new CTO Ali Krynitsky, who brings many years of operational experience leading Enterprise and Consumer Software Development and Technology projects and brings with him a loyal, experienced and hardworking team of developers.

Interestingly Ali has very strong research and academic background, making him well suited to the research and peer-reviewed-led process of building on Cardano. He is a true technical genius having worked on super interesting technology like swamm networking so the ADALend team and community are blessed to have him building for us.  Ali shares my opinion on how the macroeconomic and political events of today are accelerating the importance and relevance of ADALend and having been born in the former Soviet Union Ali understands all too well the dangers of government overreach into private individuals’ ability to earn and keep their wealth!

Ali and his team have been working around the clock to leverage the latest research and reposts from IOHK and other Cardano knowledge repositories to inform their development roadmap for the Plutus and Haskell powered staking and lending platform back end, while also working on the UX and UI to ensure its a best in class FinTech experience. We have found that one of the barriers to mass adoption of DeFi protocols it the poor frontend user experience that scares off the casual user so we have endeavored to ensure that the user experience of ADALend’s DefI and DeFi projects will be as slick and user friendly as the latest consumer applications that we expect and demand in the present environment.

On the business development and commercial side, we are busy building relationships with the regulators in Europe, the UK and Dubai to ensure we don’t hit any roadblocks like BlockFi did along the way. Obviously, another area that we are hyper-focused on is our upcoming Public IDO launch in early March, where the ADAL token will be offered to the public.

**Interviewer:** **I am delighted to hear that Ali and his technical team are delivering the goods and that the technical development road map is speeding along. Interesting developments afoot on the commercial side it seems too! The last time we spoke you were in the private sale, can you tell us more about the ADAL token launch and how our readers can learn more?**

**Koskins:** Absolutely – in the world of crypto the public launch or IDO is similar to the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of a tech company. ADALend is currently in the final stage of its private sale so it’s similar to buying Google, Amazon or Apple stock before their IPO. The ADALend private sale ends on the 28th of February so that would be the last date to buy the ADAL tokens at a significant discount. The launch will be in the first week of March and a limited number of ADAL tokens will be sold across several launchpads in parallel and will begin trading on the exchanges shortly afterward. The starting price is one US dollar, but as you know the token price can perform dynamically in the first days of trading so it is very important to register your interest early to avoid disappointment.

Yesterday I noticed some dripping from my ceiling and upon closer inspection some minor water damage and staining.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on maximizing my investment return on left over income.,"Hello PF, long time reader but it’s my first time posting. I’m seeking advice on what to do with my leftover income, as I have started making quite a bit more in my career and I would also prefer to dial down the risk from my previous years investing.

Early 30’s M currently making 160k / yr + 15% employer direct contribution to 401k. Take home fluctuates to how much I work, but an average would be 9k monthly after taxes and deductions.

I am maxing out HSA and put 9% of my earnings into same employer sponsored 401k.

MCOL area and bills are $5300/ month but that is including a $1500 food budget for eating out + groceries that could be dialed down a bit. This figure includes everything (mortgage+utilities+car..etc)

Current investments:
50k 401k
140k crypto (about half of this is staked or earning %APY interest)
7.5k random stock picks 

No CC / student loan debt just a financed car and a mortgage with around 200k in equity. 

 I have been in the crypto space for 4-5 years and stocks only recently. I have developed a large tolerance to high risk due to the crypto space, but I am not looking to put more of my income here because I already have too large of my net worth in crypto. I have already shifted that strategy away from researching new projects and buying to strictly CeFi/DeFi stablecoin farming 9-19% interest rates.

I would like to shift my strategy completely away from crypto for the remaining disposable income and into something safer like index funds. I am not too keen on dealing with real estate and having renters if I were to buy an investment property, but not completely closed off to the idea. What does everyone here recommend I do with the left over ~$3700? I’ve thought about raising up my 401k contribution to the personal max (not counting companies 15%) or start monthly buys into index funds? Rising interest rates and international turmoil make me wonder about dumping more into the stock market.",finance,1645112345.0

XRP,My XRP cointest CONs entry,"CONs for XRP based in reality not baseless FUD. XRP is perhaps the most misunderstood crypto in the entire industry and one of the most hated. Understandable because majority of early crypto was pioneered by libertarian code is law techno anarchists. Ripple is one of the largest and oldest businesses in Crypto seeking the widest commercial adoption for XRP possible. They have deliberately designed the XRP ledger from the beginning to not only integrate with banking in finance but improve it immeasurably. Against the ethos of most self described crypto evangelists, down with all banks an all that.

One of the biggest drawbacks to XRP is the cloud of FUD that has been growing around it since inception. Proven to even have been paid for at points. Constantly misrepresented to the point where people believe the technology which is intended for decentralized payments isn't decentralized. As if the entire thing wasn't created for this exact purpose. Many negative arguments about Xrpl's design for its decentralized network were somewhat true at the beginning of it's development.

Ripple chose to develop a high fidelity enterprise grade core of validators to build the BFT consensus around it was centralized. Eventually decentralizing it over time with upgrades and new nodes. This makes sense when you know that Ripples chosen use case for XRP is banking networks. Criticism abounds that the UNL is fixed an Ripple chooses who can be added. This is false, multiple UNLs exist from separate stake holders any node can become a validator if it meets hard coded criteria, it is automatic. The bar is really high to become a validator because of the XRPL's synocratic architecture.

XRP nodes do require a large investment in hardware that is expensive. Around $20k+ for a full history node and high speed internet connections. There are no incentives to participate as a node operator on XRPL. This will change as federated side chains begin expanding an offering incentives. The hardware does allow XRP to be the only large scale carbon neutral chain soon to be carbon negative because of it's efficiency. However no incentives seems to have hindered XRPs growth vs competitors while others have been able to expand secondary services/ server connections and network growth with incentives.

The elephant in the room and source for the majority of FUD around XRP is token sales and the SEC lawsuit."" Founders are enriching themselves dumping on the plebs"". This is somewhat true but needs context that nearly 99% of cryptocurrency users lack. In the decade + of XRP sales and emissions if you add Jed, Charities, and all other founders. It's around $2-3 billion over ten plus years. To put this into perspective XRPL has no miners no incentives. Compare to BTC or ETH where value extracted from the network in fees alone are over $+1 billion for a few months. Not including emissions from block incentives that have no legal framework or escrow to prevent the largest holders from dumping. Ripple also chose to sell programmatically as a % global volumes.They stopped selling in secondary markets entirely when the wash trading scandal came out in 18', it was concluded that programmatically selling was negatively impacting XRP markets even at 0.0#% of global volume.

 The sales from the execs are identical to sales from founders of other projects that don't catch any shit for it.  The tokenomics and allocation for founders is horrendously bad compared to contemporaries that have created conditions that make # go up artificially. It should be understood that when the allocation agreements were made BTC was trading for $3 and XRPs entire market cap was $4 million.  They never imagined one founders allocation would be worth Billions one day. 

Perhaps the largest impediment to XRPL'S adoption is the use case Ripple is targeting. They are going against the most powerful organizations in the world and it shows. Anyone with a lick of knowledge about finance knows how corrupted the US financial system is. Arguably why decentralized networks are growing rapidly. Wall Street Apes are familiar with Citadel as the largest central counterparty in the settlement of retail equites and derivatives in the US. We saw how that shook out for Robinhood users when RBH was essentially blackmailed into removing the buy button on meme stocks. 

Citadel is just 1 central counterparty and Ripples plans for XRP threaten the entire power structure of US finance. A functional public liquidity network  would have allowed a company like RBH to access liquidity on demand from the network to satisfy settlement of meme stocks in a neutral way. They couldn't because their partnership with Citadel is critical to have a functional business.

There is mountains of evidence that central counterparties are behind the lawsuit using it as a weapon against Ripple protecting the correspondence banking system from competition. Or at least slowing them down until they can grab market share.

 Simpson and Thatcher and Ethereum Alliance members paid former SEC chairman Clayton and Hinamen millions while in office. Hinamen gave his famous opinion on ETH gave them a free pass for their blatant ICO that they obfuscated who participated in the DAO. It's speculated JPM could potentially own +50% of all ETH in existence. The connections are through Lubin, Consensys and the Brooklyn project that Lubin created to cozy up to SEC officials and Wall Street power brokers before the infamous Hinamen speech, even before the ETH DAO.🤔

Simpson and Thatcher also represents a laundry list of Ripples competitors like Apollo Global which Clayton has direct ties to, the largest international settlements service in the world. Also Alipay the largest digital payments network in Asia as well as many of the correspondence banks. 

Clayton immediately left the SEC and began working for One River Asset management which made substantial purchases $1-2 billion in BTC and ETH prior to Clayton's tenure. They also are now in a partnership with Coinbase offering a institutional crypto platform near identical to Ripples XRP offering with the MG partnership for remittances in the Mexican corridor. Coincidence can only happen so many times before it's apparent there are concerted efforts to stop Ripple and XRP entirely. 

XRP was removed from 300+ exchanges in response to the lawsuit and remains hindered in it's potential growth. So it remains to be seen if XRPL and public liquidity networks could end up like public transportation in the US.",cryptocurrency,1645115981.0

CryptoCurrency,Pictures don't make NFT valuable. What you can do with the NFT is what makes it valuable,"So NFT in general get a bad reputation due to the current Tulip mania around them. But, NFT are actually highly useful and extremely valuable with how you can use the technology. So I figure I should list out a few things that makes NFT valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things to note so everyone is on the same page.

1. I do own a number of NFT, but with how things are today. I will not buy an NFT to invest with. There is ways of getting them for free through the metaverse and other places. I suggest you to do this so you can play around with it to understand the technology a bit more.
2. An NFT is just a file on the blockchain. 
3. A smart NFT is one that has function. Think of it like software. A smart NFT might allow the owner to edit, it might allow the owner to add info but not change past info, it might allow everyone but the owner to edit, an ability where the NFT terminates after some time, and so on.
4. Privacy NFT is one that anyone but approved wallets can't see what is in the NFT. Some even hide themselves from being seen by others on the blockchain. On some blockchains it can even hide itself where you can't see it being transferred. Basically the things you would want for medical records.
5. You need to note the cost of info on a given blockchain. Each blockchain cost differently, but current values is something like $10k per MB on ETH. So this is useful when the data is kept in KB range. In the future hopefully this gets fixed. But keep this in mind when a picture average size is something like 10MB ($100k if it was on the blockchain). (When you buy a NFT of a rock pic, you're buying a link to the rock pic and not the pic itself)
6. When I say wallet or address. Note you won't be sending crypto to it. Most likely you won't even be able to know it is a crypto wallet or on the blockchain unless if you work on the backend due to a user friendly interface.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Cars maintenance and info

So a few companies are already working on this. But basically in the future we should be able to look at the blockchain to see if a car you want to buy has been in a wreck or anything else. 

But more so, it can be possible to store maintenance records like oil changes on the blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

There is 2 ways I see this playing out.

1. The owner has full control which IMO is a bad idea. But this means the owner has to transfer the info to another wallet for it to not be their stuff anymore.
2. The gov gets involved and basically when the title transfers it revokes access from the prior owner to the new one.

How 2 can work is simply

1. The car will have it's own wallet or it will be on some gov or company wallet. There will be an NFT there which list the history of the car and can be written to. The NFT being smart can make it where given types of data can be edited while others can't. (Lets call this NFT 1)
2. The gov or whatever issues the owner an NFT to their wallet. This NFT (lets call it NFT 2) it allows the user to upload things like oil changes and other things to NFT 1. It also allows you to edit the info you added to NFT 1.
3. Then insurance companies or whatever that tells the system that your car has been in a wreck or whatever. They will have access to another NFT (lets call this NFT 3). This one allows them to add info to NFT 1 like if your car was in a wreck or whatever. NFT 2 can't edit info NFT 3 added, and NFT 2 can't add info about wrecks or whatever. But NFT 3 can't change what NFT 2 wrote (this preventing legal problems like the insurance saying you didn't change oil or whatever when you did. There could also be a solution where any changes are automatically recorded in the NFT itself. Think of it like the history on Wiki.)
4. Repair shops will have an NFT that acts as a skeleton key in acting as NFT 2. This allows them to add oil changes or whatever with only needing that one NFT. Again, a log in the NFT to say who did what can prevent corruption since each repair shop and even repair person can have their own NFT. That away for legal reasons if needed it says who did what, when it happen, and what changes were made.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as far as the user interface. This can sound extremely complicated, but just like email and much what people use today. The front end has to be dead simple. It can be simple as a website, app, or another thing which allows the person to do whatever. 

There is a few ways of doing this, but my point is this won't require you to know what is going on in the backend. It is similar to organizational unit at companies. Where the user just see it works, but the people working and developing the backend can see the entire thing in action.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Medical records

A big thing on this is with using privacy NFT along with smart functions. It is possible for medical records to be secured on the blockchain. Along with this is you would only need to fill out medical papers 1 time, and it will automatically be updated to all medical places you go. And with them doing their job, it automatically updates any changes like meds you are taking.

On top of that, something the USA system is famous for is screwing over it's citizens. Some places flat out charge you to transfer medical records or to get your medical records. This fixes this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

How it can work:

1. This most likely will happen with it being attached to your gov ID which is attached to the blockchain. Basically a system which identifies you so you can be trusted in making deals (I can get more into this, but it is a problem in contracts when someone wants/needs to keep their identity hidden but yet they need to agree to contracts. Explaining such system is out of the scope of this post, but I can get into it in a later post if people want.) But with such an ID system all a medical system has to do is search the blockchain for a match when it comes to medical records to pull up prior medical history. If you don't have any, with using a similar system as I mention in the prior part with a repair shop. They should be able to add your medical record easily to the blockchain.
2. Just like now if you haven't been to a doctor for a long time you might get some papers to read over to see if things changed (address, pain in areas, etc). But this will be added onto your medical records on the blockchain. Which means if you recently answered this stuff and the visit isn't asking about why you visit the doctor that day. Then you shouldn't have to fill out any paperwork. 
3. The insurance companies can directly be link in which allows the medical company (dental, doc office, hospital, etc) to do what they need to without asking you the client for anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the interesting thing is the people who jump from doctor to doctor. Since this is instant if a doctor prescribes drugs to the person. This will automatically be noted on the NFT, and when the person goes to another place to get that other place to give them more. Since it is all linked up into 1 system, this new doctor will see you already been giving the given drugs and something else might be going on.

&amp;#x200B;

NFT wise how would this work?

1. There will be a main NFT that gets updated similar to the car one, but this one has a privacy ability to it. We will call this NFT 1. For this given NFT only NFT 2 can write and edit, but you need to have NFT 2 or 3 to be able to read any of the data on NFT 1.
2. NFT 2 is what doctors, hospitals, etc have. This allows them to add and edit info.
3. NFT 3 is what you have, and with this you can allow others access (this will mint a NFT in their address. This can be temporary access or not. But the access can be revoked by NFT 3 holder. The reason why you would use this is for a parent, spouse, and so on.)

Obviously on this there can be a log so doctors or whatever that screw up in giving away access or that mess with the system and get ding. And there can even be a log on search info, and even if the person tried to print out the info. NFT 3 should have access to this log.

# Housing/Property and stopping identity theft 

Something that happens is deed theft or fraud. The FBI has a pretty good article on this. [https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2008/march/housestealing\_032508](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2008/march/housestealing_032508)

Basically, what happens here is since the identity is on the blockchain, it makes it impossible to steal someone's ID if the system is made right.

What would need to happen for this is:

1. The NFT needs to be a private NFT that is owned by the gov. In this case we will call this NFT 1. Within this NFT it should have all the basic info, a picture/pictures of the person. Things that can be added to this is things like degrees earn other things. The reason for this is many areas allow lawyers to submit given papers to courts through some online thing, and if the lawyer ended up getting ban or suspended. There will be an immediate reflection.
2. NFT 2 is what is given to the citizen and this allows access to view NFT 1. 
   1. NFT 2 can give permission to other wallets/NFT to view the content.
   2. NFT 2 can set permission levels on what others can see. So for example, there might be a default thing in which for employers to view given things but not other things.
3. NFT 3 employers or special groups will be able to pull given info. So like NFT 3 if you're a bank you might want to look up someone before giving a loan, and that given one gives the bank access only up to x info. Where with say an employer one it could give more or less info.
4. NFT 4 this is the ones courts and gov has access to do a read/write on NFT 1. There would just need to be laws on how to handle replacement cards and changing info.
5. With this setup, a log can be put in place which only NFT 4 can see (legal) so they can see if someone is stalking. Or maybe NFT 4 and NFT 2.

So lets say if a scammer wanted to steal a house. They don't have a matching face, finger print, and most likely other info. So they won't be able to get authority to sign stuff under your address, and since it is all on the blockchain they can't simply forge your ID or documents.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the property aspect can work like this.

1. Lets call this one NFT 5. This one represents the land/property. It will be earmarked to be linked with NFT 1. This allows multiple NFT 1 to own a given property (so like a couple).
2. NFT 2 has to sign a smart contract which transfers ownership to another NFT 2. A few things can be added like a NFT 3 (lawyer) has to also sign it. There could even be a smart aspect in this which measures the value of what is being transfer and based on this a lawyer/3rd party might be required or not.
3. When a sell happens NFT 4 (gov) will need to go in and change the earmark. Again, a smart aspect can be added where it looks at the value or type of property. So if there is state or federal or whatever regulation. Then that can be checked on before everything is final. Where if there is no regulation, then this is skipped and it is finalized as soon as the contract is signed. 

Now an interesting thing that can happen with this is there can be a rent-to-own or other agreements done under this. [https://www.investopedia.com/updates/rent-to-own-homes/](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/rent-to-own-homes/)

Basically, the smart contract will reflect whatever agreements which makes this into a trustless system.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Contracts like renting property

So in the USA when the virus hit landlords couldn't kick people out in most locations. Now they can, in some areas they are breaking their contract and abusing the system. Where the landlord has a lawyer with good internet access, and renters might not. Some cases last for 30 seconds and rule in the favor of the landlord. In some cases the judge might tell the renter to submit evidence prior by using the court site, but because only lawyers can the renter is SOL since they are too poor to afford one.

And then even in normal time there tends to be contract problems. 

What can happen is a sign agreement using a smart NFT. Basically, when the renter doesn't pay at or prior the agreed time then automatic things happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

So lets say if I have a contract with x company to build me y thing in 6 months. And then after every month they have to pay $100k to me. This can be setup to automatically kick in if things happen.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Coupon

This actually is already happening now. But basically, it is an NFT that when a store sees the wallet has it, it will automatically give whatever discount. Like I have one in my wallet right now that gives me $150 off on some real world clothes, and it has an expiration date/time. And it self terminates after 1 use. It even has a thing on there that terminates itself if I try to transfer it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Training and certifications. Even ones that expire

So this is already a thing, and it is under the POAP. It is mostly used for metaverse events and some real life events. But due to the nature of it, it can be used to prove you went through some training programs. And if it is smart, it can expire after a given time.

I was talking to someone about this the other day, and they asked what if someone fakes it by transferring to someone. There is 2 ways to fight this.

1. The ledger will show this. Like it shows it was minted (made) to that wallet.
2. There can be smart info. And there can be a thing which terminates itself if this is tried and even send alerts to given people when such event happens.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I can go on into other things like school records, sell records, taxes, and so on. But I think most have an idea.

personalfinance,"$8k in CC Debt, Advice on Options?","Hi all, 

So I've recently found myself swimming into CC debt after a combination of bad financial decisions and unforeseeable expenses and am looking for some advice on how to efficiently and quickly dig myself out. The basics:

$54k annual income (\~$3k a month post tax)

Capital One - $740; Chase - $1375; Discover - $2256; Amex - $1203; Apple/Goldman - $2446

Monthly minimum CC payments equate to \~$535

I also have \~$1980 in mandatory expenses each month (car/phone/rent/etc). This brings me to \~$500-600 monthly remaining to tackle this debt. 

This brings me to my questions - What's the best way to go about doing this? My credit score in general is decent, not spectacular, currently just above 700. I qualify for a personal loan from one of those loan providers like Upstart for $8000 but the interest rate is rather steep \~19% for a 5 year loan, payment being \~$218. I considered applying for a new card that featured 0% APR for balance transfers, but doubtful I'd be able to transfer the entire balance, likely a card or two. I reached out to my CU regarding a loan, but they're very specific that any time they do a debt consolidation loan, they require the credit cards to be closed - Interest rate is much lower than the Upstart option, but I don't want to close cards I've had for 10+ years just to consolidate debt because of the impact that would have on my credit score long term. 

So, /personalfinance friends, what do you recommend as the best option? I'm not too concerned with running the card debt back up as the vast majority of this was from events I couldn't predict (auto repairs/etc). Should I go with the higher interest loan, set up auto payments and work to pay more on it each month to pay it off faster? Or should I try to get the 0% interest card, transfer a few card balances, pay those off ASAP, and then apply for another 0% interest card, transfer a few more, rinse and repeat?

CryptoCurrency,"Cryptocurrency can make goods cheaper and stop the transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy. ""Line go up"" got this one wrong.","I was watching the ""Line Go UP"" documentary and saw the typical argument that Visa is able to process infinitely more transactions than crypto using much less energy.  What most people don't realize is:

CREDIT CARDS MAKE EVERYTHING MORE EXPENSIVE. 

Retailers don't charge different prices to use credit.  Since the transaction fee on any credit sale is 2-3%, all prices have to be inflated to cover that cost.  People with low incomes (unbanked) pay cash for goods and in essence transfer their wealth to those who reap the benefits of Credit Card reward programs.  This is explained here: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Merchant fees and reward programs generate an implicit monetary transfer to credit card users from non-card (or “cash”) users because merchants generally do not set differential prices for card users to recoup the costs of fees and rewards. On average, each cash-using household pays $149 to card-using households and each card-using household receives $1,133 from cash users every year. Because credit card spending and rewards are positively correlated with household income, the payment instrument transfer also induces a regressive transfer from low-income to high-income households in general. On average, and after accounting for rewards paid to households by banks, the lowest-income household ($20,000 or less annually) pays $21 and the highest-income household ($150,000 or more annually) receives $750 every year. We build and calibrate a model of consumer payment choice to compute the effects of merchant fees and card rewards on consumer welfare. Reducing merchant fees and card rewards would likely increase consumer welfare.

Now, imagine for a minute if I own ABC cryptocurrency (POS) that I keep in my own wallet and can stake it to earn 5% a year securing the network. The fees I pay for transaction are way less than 2% of the transaction.  I will still get ""rewards"" but the rewards will be for not spending money, rather than spending.  The incentive for me will be to buy only things that I need and anyone can access these rewards, not just those with high incomes. Those with low incomes can still borrow from others using DEFI,  but pay way less than they would with a credit card rate. 

Credit cards do the exact opposite.  Those with low incomes carry balances with astronomically high rates which subsidize the convenience and rewards for the wealthy.  The system is completely out of whack.

vet,Dogs medication causing my cats to be aggressive?,"Context: I have 4 cats and 1 dog. 

2 female sister cats - 2.5 y/o, fixed 
Male - 7 y/o, fixed 
Male - 3 months old 
Dog - 7 y/o fixed Boxer 

My dog recently started on Alazoprem less than a week ago. She takes 2mg twice a day. Since being on her medication, my cats have become extremely aggressive and irritable with her. 

Two days ago my dog sniffed my 7 y/o male cat who is generally pretty fond of her and he scratched her so hard on her face that the top of her nose was bleeding. We were surprised, but assumed that maybe it was a misunderstanding so we didn’t think too much of it. Today, my dog was scratching her ear and bumped one of my female cat’s legs and she scratched my dog VERY close to her eye causing her to bleed. A few hours later, my dog was walking by the male 7 y/o cat, not paying him any attention, and he randomly scratched her face, sinking his claws so hard into her skin that it got stuck and I had to physically remove his paw from her face. He caused her nose to start bleeding once again. My 3 m/o male cat has also been much more hissy and less tolerant of my dog. Please note NONE of my cats have EVER been aggressive with my dog, EVER. They RARELY hiss at her or hiss in general and have NEVER swatted at her or scratched her, or at anybody in my family.

I called our vet to ask if this was normal and they have no idea why my cats would be reacting like that. I did some googling that said sometimes cats can smell drugs on other animals and that Xanax can make cats aggressive so that could be a potential reason as to why they’re being so mean to her. 

Please note my cats are not acting any different with the family. They are purring, cuddling, and playing like normal. All of their irritability lies with my dog. I have an appointment set up with our vet to see about any alternatives for her medication but I am worried that any type of anxiety meds she is on will still cause the same aggression with my cats. 

Has anybody ever heard of this? Is this normal? I don’t know what to do. My dog is so sweet and stays to herself, I have no clue why my cats are reacting like this. I considered claw caps for my cats but I feel like that is not fair as they have never been this aggressive before and I can only link their aggression directly to this medication my dog is on. I have since separated my dog from my cats but it’s just not fair for my dog to have to be isolated for her own safety. She should feel comfortable in her own home without constantly bleeding. 

Im open to any and all advice or ideas. Please help.",cryptocurrency,1645131995.0

Been reading some posts about the fed and how people are anticipating rate hikes will affect crypto markets. So I want to share with you Fed Fund Futures.

Market predictions Fed funds rate

We can see that for March the market has priced in a rate hike to 0.25% with 100% probability, or confidence. And a rate hike to 0.25% should not move any markets as its fully priced in. There's a not insignificant possibility that the the fed will hike rates to 0.5-0.75% If the fed did move to target rates there, personally, I would expect markets to correct a little to the downside since the futures markets have only priced in a 33.7% probability of the fed hiking rates to within that range. But we can still see it is within the realm of reasonable expectations.

Now I think there's one caveat with crypto. Its still primarily a retail driven market and I'm not sure of its ability to price in things from established markets. If your curious how fed rate hikes effect crypto markets I would suggest using this tool, then look and see what happens when rates are announced, look at what the probabilities are, and you'll be able to answer to what degree crypto markets currently do price in federal reserve interest rate policy expectations.

**TLDR**:

While inflation should theoretically reduce the value of a particular asset, in a strong bull market, enough demand can still outweigh the selling pressure from inflation.

You can clearly see this in the inflation chart (monthly) of Sushiswap. Despite the huge inflation in the early stages to incentivise users, the value of $SUSHI is increasing rapidly. This is something interesting in the crypto space.

# General Conclusion

Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

&gt;Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

CryptoMarkets,VC capital in blockchains,"This will be a good testing ground to explore how VC backed chains will function in the time to come, especially if we have a crypto autumn or winter...

These vesting periods are typically in order of 6 months, year or two years... Depends on how well they haggled their position.
Now the interesting experiment will begin. If the FED raises the interest rates (as we know they will) venture capitalists will have to reduce their most risky position i.e. crypto. This is why the entire crypto and stock market is tanking to some extent.
This also means that VC backed chains will see bigger selloffs when their vesting periods end and prices of those coins will take a bigger hit.

personalfinance,How to determine if I will save money on a car loan refinance?,"I'm trying to determine if refinancing my auto loan will save me money. I took out a $28,700 loan with a 5.34% interest rate for 48 months in September 2019. There is $13,279 remaining principle on the loan and the payoff quote is $13,316. The refinanced loan would with a different lender (credit union) and be on the same term (21 months remaining) but with a 1.99% interest rate.

A calculator I found on Nerdwallet indicated that I would be saving \~$400 dollars with the refi but I'm not sure how accurate it is since it only took in a few input variables. The car is a 2016 Mercedes C class that now has \~40k miles on it, I also have a service contract that I took out when I bought the car that lasts until 100k miles, not sure if/how it would be affected by a refi. My monthly payment is $667, which I have no problem paying and am not really trying to lower, I'm only concerned with overall savings. I am confused by whether the refi costs are worth the lower rate, especially since from what I understand about loan amortization (very little) I paid more interest during the early life of the loan so lowering it now may not result in much overall savings.

personalfinance,"Need help choosing a car lease buyout financing term length of loan (TX, USA)","Hello, I need help selecting a term length for a loan for my car lease buyout financing loan. The car is a 2019 Kia FORTE.

The buyout quotes below were given from the leasing company. From what I recall, they work with a credit union.
They are all $0 down and include all fees and the residual (~10.5k), and use an estimated interest rate of 4.9%:

48 months at $305 per month
60 months at $250 per month
72 months at $215 per month

The leasing term was 39 months, and I was paying ~$10 more than the 48 month term per month (so ~$315 per month).

The car has &lt;20k mileage, and is generally in good condition. I only drive for work and a few errands, so about 5 round trips for a total of around 100 miles a week. I don’t expect to drive more than that soon. I’m in my late 20s, graduated college not too long ago and am at the start of my career.

I made previous posts about deciding if I should do the buyout or not, and I wrote the most additional information in this version: https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarguys/comments/rtsreo/car_lease_ending_soon_buy_new_used_or_lease_again/

What term seems most ideal for my situation?

I also would like to know if there’s any questions I should ask the leasing company, the dealership, or the credit union. I was suggested that it may be a good idea for the dealership to underwrite the loan, but I’m not sure how to bring that up with the leasing company or what else is involved?

gaming,"Help! Cyberpunk 2077 update 1.5 removed my recently hard earned Mods, Money, Abilities! How do I continue playing?","Help!? Where do I start?

I guess I should start by saying that this is my first play through and I've waited until now because of all the complaints about keybinds, [especially not being able to bind the f key](https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/key-remapping.11040601/) as well as all the bug fixes and patches before I started playing this game to make sure I had a good experience playing it just to get screwed over pretty badly with the new 1.5 update. I'll explain:

I'm about 49 hours into the game and I finally decided it was time to get some good gear. I took the time driving around the city looking for vendors that had Legendary (3 or more mod slot) clothing items for EVERY item AND Mods to go with them. I spent about **10 hours** of gameplay doing this mixing in missions and stuff, so going back to a saved game before this is out of the question.

I was conservative with the Abilities, saving them for when I really needed them. I had about 8-10 to spare. (6-6-6-10-9 or something like that). I finally decided to go all in on crafting JUST to get the “WASTE NOT WANT NOT” perk which took ALL of the rest of my Ability points, PLUS 2 (I had to level up to 26 from 22 or so). I was lucky enough to get TWO BULLY MODS with +30% Crit damage and other great mods that I just couldn't dismantle the items that had them locked onto them without the Waste Not Perk which allows for KEEPING the Mod.

I had spent close to $70k - $100k collecting clothes and legendary mods to finally upgrade to ALL Legendary (see Pics) on a crafting perk that is useless since all the Mods were removed

THEN update 1.5 auto downloads via Steam and installs.

I lost over 10 hours of gameplay time wasted.

I lost over $70,000

I lost 10 Ability points wasted, stuck on Crafting (completely useless since all MODS were removed on the update anyway)

Lost all the good mods that I spent so much time and money saving since they were nerfed from 30% to 8% and other nerfs

I literally had 20 amazing mods that complimented my play style and I can't even put HALF of those back on. I think I can use 8? Maybe? (See pic of empty nerfed clothing items)

What do I even do here? How can I continue playing? My character was totally gutted and I have no idea how to recover what is lost. It's WAY too late to start over, and I'm not even sure if I could relearn how to play the game a different way

\-Questions:

1. Can I download 1.31 anywhere and finish the game?
2. Can I reset Abilities and Money?
3. Is there any other options that I haven't thought about?

I know that 1.5% on any student loan anywhere is an excellent rate. However, I find myself internally debating whether I should pay it out over the 8.5 year payment plan, while investing the difference, or if I should tackle it faster with more payments.

The monthly payment on the S.L. is $781.00/mth., and I will have it paid by the time I am roughly 38 y.o. if I follow the payment plan as is. Also, the total interest over the life of the loan is estimated to come out to be $6,100.00 according to the Bankrate student loan calculator. Under my old payment plan, after only 2.75 years of payments I had paid almost $15,000.00 in interest at the 4.83% rate - youch.

I am looking for thoughts, ideas, anecdotes, and/or arguments on whether an expedient payment tactic is the right path, or if I should let the bank take the wheel, only pay my minimum payment, and invest any other money I'd otherwise throw at the loan.

personalfinance,Looking for helping understanding loan repayment,"**\*\*\*\*\*SOLVED\*\*\*\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to take over responsibility for a family member's mortgage and am having a hard time understanding how the repayment works exactly. I have the remaining loan amount ($61,000), the interest rate of the loan (4.25%), and the loan maturity date (2045). The monthly payment is about $860. I feel like I've clearly done something wrong in my calculations because it's being completely paid off in 7 years and not the 22 years that the loan maturity date would suggest.

Other potentially necessary information: Property tax is not factored into this amount at all because it's not taken out in escrow. Also, in my calculations, the amount subtracted from the remaining balance each year doesn't include the Interest amount on the end of each line.

My calculations:

Loan Amount: $61,000   Interest Rate: 4.25%    Length: 22 Years

Year 1: $61,000 – $7,728 = $53,272 (**Interest = $2,600**)

Year 2: $53272 – $8,052 = $45,220 (**Interest = $2,265**)

Year 3: $45,220 – $8,388 = $36,832 (**Interest = $1,922**)

Year 4: $36,832 – $8,748 = $28,084 (**Interest = $1566**)

Year 5: $28,084 – $9,120 = $18,964 (**Interest = $1,193**)

Year 6: $18,964 – $9,504 = $9,460 (**Interest = $806**)

Year 7: $9,460 - $9,912 (just do $9,460) = $0 (**Interest = $403**)

Principal: $61,000 + **Interest: $10,755** = $71,755 TOTAL

personalfinance,Is it possible to actually pay off a loan with 149% APR?,"((UPDATE)) I thought I updated  ...I talked to my oldest daughter not the one that lived with us... She's going to loan us the money we'll pay her back without interest. My son is also going to pitch in it's not that we can't afford our rent but our rent is usually a $600 and we have a small mortgage on the mobile home of $290 when my daughter moved in with her boyfriend it was supposed to be for a few weeks neither one of them had a job and it was summertime in Arizona so our electricity was $300 more they ran up the internet I had to kick him out... Got my daughter also was dragging her feet and then when they did get a job instead of paying us back they went and got a car and got their own place like I said I don't know what got into her but my boundaries are tough now and so are my wife's! I can't think that any of my other children would ever do that to us however but thank you for your advice and yes it did seem extremely crazy we need to build our credit up other than that our debt really isn't that bad.. Just with having to pay the late fees because we were paying extra we didn't really have a savings when she moved in the mortgage holder demanded we pay some late fees he said we owed after he got audited during the pandemic so we couldn't even use the stimulus to stuff away and savings for such an event. Also my wife was licensed in the state of California and then became Microsoft certified and then was a chef she suffered from untreated childhood asthma and had several very serious bouts with pneumonia and has severe COPD and rheumatoid arthritis she has the disability that is total and permanent and not expected to live past 5 years so she cannot technically be employed in the legal sense.

I work a minimum wage job $15 an hour I'm 5 years 6 years away from retirement, my wife is disabled and receives very low social security about $1,000 a month We are in a situation after letting one of our children live with us for a few months we incurred much more debt and they are not paying it back.  I have a balloon payment for my rent to pay because it accumulated late fees when I couldn't pay it on time.  We have been working on getting our credit better but the only personal loan that we qualify for was with 149% APR $1,500 FOR 18 months. Pulling the payment directly from the paycheck twice a month. At first we thought we could do it but thinking of that interest rate... will any of it actually go to the principal? 
We're both extremely scared We do not want to get buried in this I only have one credit card and it has a $250 limit and that is almost maxed out. We don't own a vehicle and we're paying a mortgage on a mobile home The rent is for the space rent. 
My wife not being able to work really pulled us down in the income department and I've had to be the sold breadwinner and I'm not highly skilled she was highly skilled. We are just a paycheck away from a disaster adding this debt without having the means to pay it off seems like a very poor decision I wanted to know if anyone knew if it was actually possible to pay it back though Thank you for your advice in advance. ((Just to add our child does not live here anymore but took her first paychecks and bought a car and moved out instead of giving us the money she owed us. She wasn't raised that way and my other children aren't that way so we're not sure what happened but it has been very heartbreaking indeed.))",finance,1645149364.0
CryptoCurrency,Solana: Contrarians May Find it Appealing at Today’s Prices,"\-This is the best news for long-term Solana holders in my opinion.

In contrast to last month’s meltdown, February so far has seen a rebound in enthusiasm for crypto. With some exceptions. One exception in particular: **Solana** (**SOL-USD**). Its performance in recent weeks has been mixed at best.

Largely, due to developments pertaining directly to it. On Feb 3, news of a cyberattack involving **Wormhole**, a bridge between **Ethereum** (**ETH-USD**) and Solana, caused SOL-USD’s rebound back above $100 per coin to lose momentum. The market has more or less absorbed this negative news. But as investors become bullish again for crypto, instead of diving back into this former favorite, they’re opting for the other major coins.

For example, **Bitcoin** (**BTC-USD**), which is, unsteadily, moving back toward $45,000 per coin. Ethereum is also on a relative upswing, staying at prices around $3,000 per coin. In contrast, SOL-USD has made little progress making up for its January losses. It’s at around $94 per coin today, down from around $178 per coin at the start of 2022.

Yet while its recent performance has been disappointing, there may be a silver lining. Beaten down and out of favor, you may want to consider it. If two things play out, there may be big upside potential for this hard-hit “Ethereum killer.”

### Why Solana is Struggling to Make a Comeback

The recent cyber attack on Wormhole isn’t the only reason why SOL-USD has seen choppy performance since late last month. Past network issues continue to have a negative impact on its performance as well.

Before, I’ve discussed Solana and its questionable reliability. Its network has experienced multiple disruptions. Despite all the talk about its high speed, and other positives, this has likely dented confidence that this high-utility altcoin has what it takes to grab a large share of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market from Ethereum.

Even so, the fact that the market has gone from being overconfident about SOL, to worrisome about its prospects, could be something that works in your favor. Now a contrarian play within the crypto space, it may have ample upside potential.

Assuming, of course, that two things happen.

First, that the crypto recovery carries on. Instead of sinking it further into “crypto winter,” rate hikes actually have an indirect positive effect on the space. Second, this coin’s developers are able to repair Solana’s dented reputation. Both things may have a good chance of playing out.

### How SOL-USD Could Get Out of its Recent Slump

In my recent crypto coverage, I’ve taken a bearish view on the space. Why? With interest rates rising, there will be a continued move out of riskier assets. Coupled with other negatives, like increased regulations, and the “crypto winter” could carry on into the spring, summer, and fall.

That said, I’ll admit that it’s not guaranteed to play out that way. In fact, per the view of one market commentator, **Fundstrat’s** Tom Lee, rising interest rates could end up being a positive. As rates rise, and negatively affect both bonds and speculative stocks, investors may decide to cycle into cryptos. The resultant inflows could keep this asset class on an upwards trajectory.

So, what could this mean for Solana? It’ll likely need more than just that to make a recovery. If it continues to have the reputation that its network is unreliable, it will continue to languish. But with its developers at work fixing network issues via upgrades, today’s perceptions about the reliability of its blockchain could reverse.

Along with new innovations, such as its recently launched Solana Pay protocol for e-commerce, confidence in this “Ethereum killer” could return, enabling it to rise back up to past price levels.

### Bottom Line: Consider Solana a Cautious Buy

The risk/return proposition on SOL-USD may now be more favorable. Yet don’t take that to mean it’s become less risky. Further outages or cyber attacks could stymie its plans to restore its reputation. New developments like Solana Pay could fail to help it regain its status as one of the top contenders to grab the DeFi crown from Ethereum.

The above-mentioned bull case for crypto is also far from a slam dunk. Instead, my prior, more bearish take on where crypto’s heading could prevail. As interest rates rise, and the dollar regains strength, alternatives like this asset class could fail to thaw out from their “winter.”

Still, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy it. Just keep these risks in mind when sizing positions. Remember that as recently as last summer, it was trading for less than a third of what it trades for today.

Sentiment about Solana has seen a big shift over the past few months. But given the prospect of the negative view of it swinging back to positive? Now may be the time to buy it. Even a partial recovery could mean big gains for contrarians taking the plunge today. by **Newcryptocurrencynews.com**",cryptocurrency,1645149629.0

I've been told that I could get this rate on a $400-420k place. Above that price would bring up the interest rate. The maximum I can get approved for as a single person with no additional income from the place is about $500k.

For multi unit spaces I would live in one of the units and rent the rest. Or perhaps buy an rv / travel trailer and live on the property on weekends when I'm off work so all of the spaces could be rented. I work 50 minutes away where I might live in the rv during the work week.

The lender I've been working with states that the ***minimum*** down payment for a:

1 unit place is 5%

2 unit place is %15

3-4 unit place is %25

Is that dictated by some governing / regulatory body or is that up to the lender?

personalfinance,"How best to use a chunk of bonus money - pay of credit cards, or buy stocks?","My niece's company suddenly got an influx of a large sum of money, which has resulted in a totally unexpected bonus worth 1 year's gross salary for each employee. Works out to almost $50k for her. She's jumping for joy, but is sensible enough to want to use that money for maximum impact and not go on a buying spree.

She has almost 28k of credit card debt, and a some student loan. She was thinking of ignoring all that investing all her money in a mix of stocks/mutual funds and some in her 401k. (Her employer will not match anything going to 401k from the bonus). Her logic was that once that money grows a bit in a year or so, she would pay off her debt.

I examined her credit cards and their interest rates range from 20% to 28%. As far as I can see, wiping out the CC debt should be a primary step, particularly with such high rates. Even at the most optimistic, returns from the stock market would only be between 10-20%, which pales in comparison to the ""savings"" from not paying those crazy rates on the cards.

The thing is, deductions on that 50k might be substantial, in taxes etc, so it's not like she has all of that available for her use, which probably will make it an either/or situation - she can't pay off the debt and still have a lot to invest.

Is my advice to her correct, that she should first pay off all her cards, then max out her 401k, and then invest in regular stocks/funds if anything is left over? She says her student loans are a low rates, but will find out exactly how much; if truly low, I would ask her to not bother paying them off now.

I should add that her CC debts are from before, and nowadays she's very circumspect buying anything on credit. Once wiped out, she might not use the cards at all.",finance,1645154628.0

I'm 18 years old and started my job here at the same age 7 months ago. I filled out all of the required information for my W-4, researched everything I needed to research for the information requested and made sure the information I was putting in was correct. 

Come tax season, I file through an agent because I don't have the time in my day to do it myself. I'm always very busy throughout the day taking care of things so I just had an agent do it for me. And they write back to me saying I am not eligible for a return from the IRS because my W-2 doesn't show any federal income tax withholdings. [Which is severely concerning.]

I asked them about it and why this might be the case, and they wrote back to me saying ""The minimum age to claim the EIC is generally age 19;""

So I'm sitting here at a loss trying to figure out what this means for me going forward and if I'm going to be nailed by the IRS. This is my first time ever filing my taxes since this is my first employment where I receive a W-2 [My previous employment only lasted 3 months, was part time, and made too little to qualify me to file my taxes, from what I can research.]

I just need some help and filling in on what my situation is looking like going forward. I'm freaking out over here worried every penny I've saved up to move into my own apartment and get work done to my vehicle is gonna be all eaten up by the IRS due to a mistake.",finance,1645160836.0

#Stock market faces the most ‘massive misallocation’ of ‘capital in the history of mankind,’ says ARK’s Cathie Wood

*Published: Feb. 17, 2022 at 1:51 p.m. ET
By Mark DeCambre*

&gt; Cathie Wood, the star fund manager and chief executive of ARK Invest, took to CNBC to defend the woeful performance of the manager’s suite of disruptive innovation funds.

&gt; Wood told the business network in a Thursday interview that the gravitation of money managers toward benchmarks, rather than taking risk on what she views as potentially game-changing technology in gene editing, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, among others, was creating a “massive misallocation of capital” in markets that could be the biggest in “the history of mankind.”
“Benchmarks are where they are because of past successes…If we are right, those are the companies that will be disrupted,” she said on CNBC.  

&gt; She said “absolutely,” when asked if some of the companies her funds have invested in, which enjoyed nearly parabolic run-ups during the height of the pandemic-fueled worries in 2020, would return to their pandemic heights.

&gt; So far in 2022, each of the flagship ARK Innovation’s ARKK, -5.63% 40 holdings had fallen more than 10%. The fund itself has slumped 26% year to date, and lost more than half its value over the past 12 months, FactSet data show:

**[SEE CHART: https://archive.today/BXYwK]**

&gt; By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.49% was down 5% in the year to date, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, -1.74% was trading 7.4% over the same period, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.30% has declined by 11.5% and the large-capitalization Nasdaq-100 index NDX, -2.30% was off 12.4%, as of Thursday afternoon.

&gt; Wood said the shares of all of the companies that ARK has bought in its various funds would return to lofty heights and trade well beyond their pandemic tops, including investments in companies such as Roblox Corp. RBLX, 0.85%, Teladoc Health TDOC, -3.38% and Zoom Video Communications ZM, -5.75%.

&gt; “We are not going back to the old ways of doing things,” she said about the surge in value in the cache of stocks bought by ARK that saw revenue accelerate during the COVID public health crisis.
She also made the case that mature growth companies, including those considered in the FAANG category, such as Meta Platforms FB, -2.71% (formerly known as Facebook Inc.), Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.82%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.17%, Netflix NFLX, -1.97% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOG, -2.70% GOOGL, -2.85%, would face bigger challenges, if interest rates rise and inflation pressures persist, than her disruptive innovative investments.

&gt; “The companies that are going to be hurt most by inflation and interest rates—if they are going to be a problem—are those that are in the mature growth category,” she said.

&gt; She reiterated that investors in ARK need to maintain a 5-year time horizon to eventually reap investment rewards.

&gt; “If we are right and the growth rate [is]15% on an annualized rate over the next five years, interest rates and inflation are not going to be a problem for,” ARK’s investments, she said.

&gt; To those who are betting on the failure of ARK, Wood said the idea of shorting innovation is “ridiculous,” referencing funds, including Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF SARK, 5.69%, which can be used to wager against ARK’s roster of investments.

&gt; “The idea of shorting innovation in America is ridiculous, I think,” she said.

&gt; “The pendulum has swung…and if we are right, the rewards are going to be enormous,” she said. (It is worth noting that Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital, has said that his fund is geared toward those who want to take the other side of Wood’s bets as well those who are simply looking to protect against losses on such investments.)

&gt; Meanwhile, Wood also said that more than half of her personal net worth was tied up in ARK and its funds and that she feels the pain of investors who are suffering through current declines.",finance,1645162920.0
CryptoCurrency,Crypto and the Dot-com bubble may have more in common than I'd like to admit but it's not all bad.,"I've been reading about the dot-com bubble, and I'm no bear so I hate to admit it but there are similarities between what happened to internet, telecommunications and tech companies in 1999-2000 and crypto today. Whether it be projects getting billion dollar valuations without having much of a product to show, the Fed continuously raising interest rates, or even the spike in the number super bowl commercials it is eerie how closely crypto seems to be repeating the pattern of the early internet. It felt bleak and maybe it is but then I came across this:

*In a 2015 book, venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who funded many dot-com companies and lost 90% of his net worth when the bubble burst, said about the dot-com bubble:*

**""A friend of mine has a great line. He says 'Nothing important has ever been built without irrational exuberance.' Meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever. And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high throughput backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all our lives... that's what all this speculative mania built""**

We may lose some capital (I really hope not!) but what is being built here will endure and help shape a world we can hardly imagine. Thanks for investing in the future fellow redditor.",cryptocurrency,1645164148.0
Forex,Where next for GBP/USD?,"GBP/USD is on track for a third consecutive week of gains, as the latest inflation and employment figures from the UK beat expectations. The pair could be on a new uptrend after bottoming out in December, and forming a higher low in late January. If the market now sees the strong economic data as putting pressure on the BOE to hike rates more aggressively, it could support GBP/USD higher leading up to the next meeting. This might potentially allow the pair to target a break above resistance near 1.370, and cement a new uptrend.

However, the already hawkish Fed President Bullard came out again yesterday to state that the central bank may need to raise rates beyond the neutral target to curb inflation. With many fearing that the Fed is currently behind the curve, this could reignite speculation of an even more aggressive interest rate decision at their upcoming meeting. This would likely support US Dollar bulls, and could see the GBP/USD run into the downward trending resistance coming from its June 2021 highs. 

All trading carries risk, but it should be worth keeping an eye on this pair, as the mid-term direction could likely depend on which central bank the market deems are more hawkish.",finance,1645164693.0

personalfinance,Should I continue to rent or pull the trigger on purchasing my first home?,"I’ve always been renting, at least since I got married. The idea of buying a house has always been with me but never made a solid decision to proceed. Well, mostly due to working contract jobs which I would have still qualified for a mortgage but with extra paperwork to prove the steadiness aspect of it. 

Anyways, with the inflation and current hot housing market, I’ve somewhat made the decision to buy a house even tho the same house would’ve costed me 30-40% less back in 2019. 

I’ve been laid off during Covid, however I’m back in the workforce and have a pre-approval for a mortgage. My concern is, what if the market crashes and I’m under water or even worst losing my job. 

Also, I cannot afford to buy where I’m now since homes are starting at least $1M+. Therefore, I can only afford in the areas further out (100 miles+), and since I got little kids I’d like to stay close to my family for their support for at least another year, so I’d most likely continue to rent until then. On the other hand, if I end up buying a house I’d have to rent it out. 

My question is should I continue to rent for another year or so, perhaps the market corrects itself and houses could be sort of back at where they were pre Covid (which is highly unlikely)… or should I proceed with the purchase? 

One of the reasons I’m leaning towards buying is that I think the market will continue to go upwards with the interest rate alike, which I don’t want to miss out on. Also, I would certainly have to buy at some point, with the kids growing up, as they would want their own rooms. 

I keep weighing the pros and cons and I can’t seem to make a solid decision. Any input would be highly appreciated!

Edit #1: I have about 10% for DP alongside 6 month of expenses for emergency funds. Also, with the purchase my DTI ratio would be at 35% of my income which I think is a healthy ratio.",finance,1645170919.0
CryptoMarkets,Decentralized Microloans: The future of Microloans,"Getting loans as an SME or small-scale entrepreneur has always been difficult.  This is why the concept of Microloans/Microlending is very impressive and even altruistic. Microlending is the act of granting small loans (microloans) to those in financial need. These loans are generally used by entrepreneurs with a business idea or SME’s who need extra cash to expand their business. They can range from $20 – $1000 and have extremely affordable interest rates (or in some cases no interest rate) and terms. The main goal of microlending is to help entrepreneurs who would otherwise be unable to borrow money to launch or expand their businesses, thereby reducing poverty in impoverished areas. 

Today’s microlending system involves a website like suku.world, investors, (a microlender that lends to borrowers in a particular location like a financial institution such as a small NGO or large commercial bank), and a borrower. Investors browse the microlending website for one or more people or ideas in which they may want to invest. The microlending website collects the funds and channels them to the borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. The borrower then invariably pays back the microloan with interest.

The most impressive feature of Microlending for me is the fact that micro-lending organizations also actively participate in the training of entrepreneurs on how to run successful businesses. This benefits both microlender and borrower because it improves the borrower’s intellect while also helping to ensure that the borrower will make enough profit to pay back their loan.",cryptocurrency,1645172795.0

The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) and participating financial institutions have begun testing the digitalized national fiat currency. The trials have been launched after a prototype of the digital ruble platform was completed in December, 2021.
I feel that the growth in CBDCs will affect the crypto market positively because people will see the perks of crypto as against CBDC. People will see that they can copy the trades of highly performing traders on Tycoon.io and others social trading platforms to earn revenue. 
Twelve banks applied to join the pilot group for the project and three of them have already connected their systems to the CBDC platform.

CryptoCurrency,CEX staking or non custodial-wallet?,"Hi all,

Just wanted to gather some community data for insight on my own strategies, would be very curious to know what you do with you crypto and why.

- Cryptocurrency kept on CEX for interest and/or because you don’t trust yourself with seed phrases

- Non-custodial wallet, whether it be cold storage or not, if PoS you may be staking still but coins like BTC will have no interest accrual here, obviously higher security

- Diversification in which a portion of your portfolio is held up on CEXs earning interest, another portion may be in cold storage for example

My current allocation is all in CEX platforms, however I am diversified into 2-3 different platforms so that if one exchange went down or if my funds were frozen, the other accounts would still be accessible.

I’m tempted to put it all into one CEX that offers the highest interest rate for me (no shill on which one) for ease of use, metrics, taxing purposes, slightly higher interest rate etc. but I’m not sure if this is a bit of a dumb move, I feel like my current allocation strikes a good balance for my risk appetite, but can’t help but want simplicity and best earning potential.

What’s everyone else do here, where do you store your crypto and why? Do you keep in several different wallets/platforms?

In before “not your keys not your crypto”, yeah we get it, I’m aware of the downsides, but there’s downsides to holding PoW coins in a non-custodial wallet too, earning potential wise and just because people forget or lose things and can’t be trusted with their shit half the time.",cryptocurrency,1645180873.0
investing,"What sectors, specially within industrial productions, will be impacted the most by inflation?","I have seen many talks about the impact of interest rates on tech, specially companies that have huge debts.

But how about industrial sector. High inflation means higher productivity costs but it also makes it easier to pay debts.

Using Befesa as example, it is a German company that recycle steel dust and aluminium residues. It works offering services to industries and construction sites in collecting steel and aluminum hazards. Their recycled products are offered to industries, specially car industries. It has bought the largest recycling company in the US in 2021 and has two new production lines in China.

It has a huge debt which may be reduced by inflation but energy crisis, specially in China and Europe, will interfer in the production costs.

Their service is essential to industries because they can not dump mineral hazards in the land field or let it be collected by average industrial trash collector companies. On the other hand, with high inflation causing less demand and higher costs the demand for their services may be reduced, unless governments, specially in China, have a stimulus plan.

But how about Befesa products buyers? Would it be cheaper or more expensive for them to buy recycled steel, aluminum and other byproducts? Does mining business have lower costs than recycling ones?

personalfinance,Why did I get margin called even though I didn’t borrow money?,"I have a new Etrade brokerage account where I deposited roughly $6,000 in non-borrowed cash from my checking account.

She went to a State college and got some benefits from it. I was prepared to also get help from my parents (they insist I go to college and also insist I pay for my own education or else they’ll kick me out and/or ship me away at 18) but they are apparently not planning on helping.. at all. 

I got admitted to NYU early admissions, but my CSS profile was submitted late (courtesy of my lovely mother). The school is offering $0 in-school need based financial aid because of this and the fafsa only comes around to 14,995. The cost to attend after deductions is still 76,755 yearly. I was offered a $3500 subsidised loan and a $2,000 unsubsidised loan. I was also offered a $68,313 federal plus loan. 

My parents are trying to reject this for me even though they aren’t paying anyway and I won’t let that happen.  Chose this school out of hundreds because it is my dream. I know it ma sound a little quaky, but is here any advice on how to go about this?



Update: thank you for all your advice. I’m literally 17 so the downvotes are kinda petty lol. But I’m going to call tomorrow and see if I can increase my need based aid and if I can’t then I’ll decline the offer. Thanks again!


Update #2: Okay, this is getting a lot more attention than I initially thought it would. So I’m gonna clarify a few things. 

1. My parents do NOT OWE me money for college as a function of their “job”. The reason why I mentioned my parents is because they promised me and my siblings since we were young (continuously) regardless of any costs. There was no planning or foresight (paying is not the issue tbh, it’s the fact there was NO planning even though they knew. They ARE irresponsible and thats not a debate).

2. I’m only 17 (I’m a guy) and though I have researched, I didn’t have a lot of information about student loans and debt. I am NOT a financial guru. I do NOT have a lot of knowledge about my situation and I sought help. Making fun of me or bring cynical towards me because of my age and/or situation is not helping anyone.

3. THANK YOU. I’m not taking the offer. I had hundreds of people warning, scolding, begging me to not do this. Im listening. Im waiting on other, more affordable college options whom offer better financial aid at this point. Thank you so much.",finance,1645186030.0

Going Digital: The order will also include a study into the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency. The U.S. Federal Reserve is already looking into this.

Details: The study will also examine financial stability issues, privacy issues, digital distributed ledger technology, coordination with other governments, and measures to protect people from crypto-related risks.

The Good: Proponents say that the federal regulation of crypto is good because it will legitimize crypto and it will protect users from scams.

The Bad: Opponents say that the federal regulation of crypto is bad because it could inhibit innovation and drive down crypto prices.

Final Thoughts: Even without regulation now, crypto prices have been down this year, mirroring the broader market.

personalfinance,Is a Personal Loan a good idea in my situation?,"Hello,

I am currently in my last semester of college and I'm planning my finances for the rest of this year. Back in 2018, I stupidly bought a car with an amount of $14,000 with an interest rate of 23%. Yeah pretty dumb on my part but so far I made every payment of $443 and the loan term was for 4 years so my last payment would be in December this year. Currently, I'm working full-time at a restaurant bringing only about like $800 biweekly and FAFSA refunded me about $2,800 this year which is still sitting in my account. I'm actively searching for a job in my field so I don't have to worry about finances come graduation. I also want to mention that I'm locked into a lease for $635 a month until July. After, I'm planning to move in with my sister until I secure a job.

I'm planning for the worst case scenario in the case I don't land a job by May. The $443 car payment was never an issue since every year I had the money from FAFSA acting as sort of a safety net if my expenses exceeded my income for the month. I just don't want to shoot myself in the foot and juggle this high car payment with other monthly expenses which all totals out to around $1,200 in the summer all while actively searching for a job.

My remaining balance/final payoff amount on the car note is $3,950.46 and I just got accepted for a personal loan for $4,000 for 3 years with an APR of 8.45% totaling to an expense of $4542.89. After paying off the car, this would erase the $443 payment for the year and then I would only have to focus on making the $126.23 monthly loan payment. I plan to sell the car for around $7,000 and use the money to pay off this loan as quickly as possible/ get into a cheaper car.

This would be my first time making a financial decision like this and I was wondering if this sounds like a  good idea? Is there something I should  be aware of before accepting the final terms of this loan?",finance,1645200108.0

There is one scenario where an uncertainty relief, at the same time as crypto is slowly pulling from its $32K bottom, could create a perfect storm with covid relief into a very big upward price catapulting, as key Fed and Ukraine news could create their perfect storm of relief.

# The Fed situation.

For those who haven't followed the Fed rates, last year they laid out a plan to increase rates for 2022.

The goal is to bring back the same rates as 2020 for this year. Targeting 0.9% by the end of the year. And targeting around 1.9% by 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gm3lbmudyli81.jpg?width=1227&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e23ba6878d81c30211d58310cfe620fac9339eac

You might say these are still abysmal low rates, and not much of an increase. The cost of borrowing is still gonna be very low, and nobody is gonna abandon stocks when rates are still this low, and inflation still very high. But keep in mind, we've been at near 0 rates, and started this year at 0.2%.

This is still a worry for the stock market that has been riding on free liquidity from the Fed printers.

But this is news we've known since last year. And we've known the rates since December. We've known the inflation was really high and above 7% for a couple weeks. We also know unemployment has been going down.

Not only has the market very likely priced all this in by now (as it showed by going into correction mode last month), but it may have overly priced this.

We are at 5 hawkish meetings in a row.5 meetings with bearish pricing in.

March is the last meeting before the start of the hikes. But the expectation for that meeting is already hawkish.

Meaning, we likely already saw all the pricing for a hawkish narrative. And it may have been overly priced in.

# The Ukraine situation.

The big story keeping uncertainty in the stock market, and consequentially, a little bit in the crypto market too, is the looming invasion of Ukraine...or the Putin bluff.

For those who haven't kept up with this crisis, Putin wants guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO.

He has built up troops along the border.

It could be a bluff, to pressure NATO to strike a deal and give him assurances.

He could plan an invasion to seize parts of Russian speaking Ukraine, or take Kyiv and the whole country to force a new regime.

If Russia invades, it would come at enormous costs for Russia. Russian economy is not in a state right now where it can afford the cost of war, and the increased international sanctions.

Also, if it were to invade, it has already lost the element of surprise, and hasn't gotten Russian citizen ready with a campaign of propaganda, like it did before the invasion of Crimea.

In either case, the clock is ticking.

Russia needs low temperatures and frozen marshes to be able to move its tanks on key points like Kyiv, without risking being pinned in choking points and taking longer and more difficult terrain.

So we'll probably know within a month from now, if this was a bluff.

# What does this mean for making a play in the market?

There is an opportunity for a big spike of relief in the stock market, which could translate into a bigger spike in price in crypto.

The two big downward pressure on price recently have been Fed rates and Ukraine.

First, the Fed hawkish narrative has likely reached its apex, has been priced in for a long time, with a big correction already, and many meetings, and still hawkish expectations.

And it may even have been overly priced in. We are only going back to 2020 rates this year.

After the March meeting, if there was still some uncertainty in the market, it will mostly be gone.

The big one is Ukraine.

Worst case scenario- It's Crimea 2.0. Russia invades. Russian stocks get clobbered. There's an initial panic across markets.

Best case scenario- It was a bluff. Russia pulls some of its troops from the border. Markets get a relief and lose that downward pressure.

# Conclusion.

If Russia pulls out in March, along with the end of Fed uncertainty in Mach, and maybe even not so hawkish news, it could create a very big spike of relief.

In addition, if covid restrictions continue to be lifted across the world, supply chains continue to get de-clogged, and businesses continue to return to normal, it could all amplify into a big stock rally and an even bigger crypto rally. Creating a perfect storm of relief.

Since this is happening after Bitcoin has emerged from a $32K bottom, the rally could potentially go parabolic.

This is one potential scenario. Many things can happen to get in the way of this. A new covid variant. Another crisis.

But the risk vs reward isn't looking bad in this play. Mainly because the potential reward could be pretty big. The risk is not too ridiculously high.",cryptocurrency,1645200269.0
personalfinance,Student debt consolidation,"Hi guys. Reaching out because I told myself I would consolidate my student debt when I graduate. Now I graduate in may and I still feel clueless on the topic and timing of consolidation. 

All of my loans have dispersed making for a grand total of 46800 in private loans. I've been consistently paying atleast 500 a month on these loans throughout their dispersal. I currently have a balance of 37600. I also have 10k in federal loans which I do not have to pay rn due to COVID.

My interest rate is 5.6%. The first loan was taken out in my name. The second loan I had to have my dad cosign on.

The thing that bothers me is that my loans are through the PA forward program, which is supposed to have the lowest interest rates, however interest got frozen due to COVID for the whole duration I've had these loans. Most people I know have not been paying interest, even with private loans, meanwhile I've been racking up $150 ish per month for the past two years.

Because of the newest extension, until may 2022, I feel like I should consolidate sooner rather than later. Can I consolidate through a company that will adhere to the 0% interest? What are the benefits/downfalls? Will I even be able to attain a lower interest rate in my name, since they wouldn't give me a loan without a cosigner 6 months ago?

Note: student loan debt is my ONLY debt. I have no car payment or cc debt.",finance,1645200403.0

[This is the document](https://www.chase.com/content/dam/chase-ux/documents/personal/mortgage/mortgage-insurance-questions.pdf) that they have online that covers what would be considered for a reconsideration of early removal of PMI. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased my home originally in 2018. FMV $275k 

We moved in and immediately did some renovation. New master bath. Took carpet (I know) out of the guest bath. Changed floors. Refreshed kitchen. Interest rates dropped and June of last year we refinanced. New FMV was 335k. Which is fine. Since June there have been 4 homes on our street not just the neighborhood that have sold significantly above that. There is a home across the street from me that has 1 less bedroom no 1/2 bath less sq ft and not as recently renovated as mine that is listed at $370k ( I know list is not sell price). Since June we have only done minor things (new garage door, new paint, new insulation) that were important but not really major improvements. 

&amp;#x200B;

I provide this information to ask is it reasonable to attempt a PMI cancellation? I would rather not have to refinance again however both my wife and my credit has jumped a pretty good amount since June (thanks to a bonus that went 100% to debt payments) so it wouldn't be the end of the world but ideally I would like to submit the paperwork pay for the appraisal and put it in the banks hand. What steps should I take? Would it be better to reach out to my realtor first? Call the bank mortgage department directly? Ideally I don't want to waste money arbitrarily getting an appraisal for them to say that market value isn't the same as home improvements.

personalfinance,Home Improvement Refi or Cash?,"Wife and I want to do a family room addition. My first thought was to run out and get a cash-out refi before rates get worse, since its likely Fed will increase prime at least 3x this year. My current mortgage is 3.25% on a 30yr fixed with more than 20yrs left. My bank thinks I would likely pay closer to 4-4.5% for the refi given recent increases. There's about $220k equity in the house if I sold today.

The thing is, we have more than enough liquid assets to write a check for the $70k. I'm wondering if it's worth doing that vs getting a refi with its mountain of paperwork, increased interest rate, fees etc.

With real estate the rule of thumb for me had always been to use OPM but I dont know if it makes sense here. Would appreciate any advice on how to make a sound decision.",finance,1645204090.0
deeplearning,What is the reason weight averaging works in Federated Learning?,"Helloo everyone!

I recently started learning about Federated Learning ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf)), but I've got curious about how the weight averaging method works (FedAvg in this paper). 

It is basically just averaging numerical values of weights and biases of models, I cannot understand how this method can improve model performance. 

What is the theory behind the FedAvg algorithm? is it just a heuristic algorithm? How just a simple weight averaging can improve the model performance? 

Additional question: for the same tasks, how much different between independently trained deep neural networks under same conditions? Can they have totally different parameter values?

I am a 24 year old with a good income, good credit score, and a moderately high tolerance for risk. I have about 60k  invested (stocks) and 12k in cash. I have really been itching to buy a  house with my two brothers in Austin, TX so we can stop throwing away  money in rent. For it to make sense for us, we need to put 20% down. I  really don't want to sell out of the market to fund this down payment.

Would  it be crazy to get cash from a margin loan worth about 15% of my  portfolio?  Many brokerages offer rates even lower than mortgage loan  rates. Robinhood for example offers an interest rate of 2.5% on margin  loans. Seems like a steal to me, though this isn't something I often  hear about doing.

Here's what I'm  wondering. Is the 2.5% interest rate offered by Robinhood too good to be  true? What about the 2% from M1 Finance or any of the other brokers? Is  there something I'm overlooking? What is the real probability of  getting margin called if my margin never exceeds 20%? Do these smaller  brokerages margin call when interest rates rise just because they can  re-lend at better rates?

financialindependence,FIRE and climate change: How are you dealing with the cognitive dissonance?,"FIRE **requires** infinite economic growth on a finite planet.  We're told from our first spoon-fed lesson of econ 101 that any impediments to growth will be bulldozed out of the way by innovation.

Except, our very economic growth is now cooking the planet.  We vaguely recognize the issue, yeah, but we have not come to grips with the full reality of what it means.  We keep seeing heads of state fly off to climate conferences to make 'commitments' with absolutely nothing behind them.  Look at the IPCC reports, and almost all of the scenarios outlined require carbon air capture (a technology decades away from maturity) deployed to a greater extent than we've ever deployed *any* infrastructure, and backed by near limitless clean energy.

In short.  The news is not good.  The world we know today will soon be irrevocably changed.  It's questionable whether human civilization as we know it can survive another century.  Just about every prominent scientist studying climate change acknowledges this, but puts on a brave face and insists there's still time, but what most don't say is that they're just hoping to salvage as much as possible while we're still able to muster a coordinated response.

Now, with that said, I don't believe the world is 'ending'.  I don't even think that the worst effects will happen in my lifetime.  My question is, what do you think happens to our investments after a couple bad decades, and the business community slowly comes to grips with what's to come?  Do you really think investment returns will support you for another 50 years?

The future is unknowable, but the scale of the problem is undeniable.  I can only look at this issue for so long until I simply can't bare to think of it anymore, bury my head in the sand, and tell myself everything will be ok.

Has anyone here undertaken major life changes to try and prepare for this?  I'm not talking about abandoning all rationality and becoming a crazy prepper in the woods waiting, but short of that?  Has climate change made you reconsider where you'll live in retirement?  Have you taken up homesteading or tried to organize a more resilient community?  What's your 'plan b' if returns don't support your retirement?

---

edit: 

Ok, perhaps FIRE does not require infinite economic growth, but FIRE but I think FIRE would prove *very* difficult during a period of low returns and high inflation.  I think that could easily come about if the market fundamentally missprices the risks of climate change, and we have higher inflation.  If you want to see what such a period looks like, go plug the mid 1960's or 1910's into a retirement calculator.  Now consider, would climate change be a better or worse scenario than those start points?",finance,1645206927.0

personalfinance,"Auto Loan, Monthly interest amount increase after I pay additional principal each month","Little bit background story:

Came to the US as an international student, no credit history, no real experience or knowledge about how loans or APR work.

When I first decided to purchase a new vehicle (big mistake) I had a little bit of cash. My first approved loan APR was somewhere between 12%-13%. For more than a year I made my monthly payments on time and decided to refinance which I did with my current financial institute.

Now I am in a financial situation where I can make additional principal payment each month same amount as my monthly payment so I decided to look into my monthly statements and how much I am actually paying for interest and principal. That's where I got confused. In the past I've been paying $30 extra on top of the monthly payment to reduce my principal payment. But every time I pay additional payment the next month's interest amount is more than usual.

For example on my Sep, 2021 statement I can see that $325.03 went toward principal and $78.28 went toward interest and I only made monthly payment no additional( please see the loan details below). On the next month, Oct, 2021 statement, $317.7 went towards principal payment $85.61 for interest. This is where I got confused. Should't the interest amount must be lower than the previous months? In same cases, interest amount increased by the amount of $20 something almost same amount as the additional principal payment. It's like I am being penalized for trying to pay my loan early.

Please explain to me

defi,Stablecoins and the Future of Money,"True stablecoins, deposit coins, and CBDCs could each deliver on what economists Gary Gorton, of the Yale School of Management, and Jeffery Zhang, of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, refer to as “no questions asked” money. Any material legal uncertainty for true stablecoins could be addressed by incremental changes to existing law. As currently being considered, true stablecoin regulation should include: requirements for permissible reserve assets and for the issuer to honor direct redemption claims; and limits on risky maturity transformation activities. Laws that bolster reserve segregation and coin holder claims in bankruptcy or insolvency should be considered. Through a sensible regulatory approach, true stablecoins can fulfill their promise without introducing new risks.

The question for central banks and regulators then becomes which combination of the three approaches can also improve competition, lower cost, and increase access to the financial system. While it may be tempting to preserve the status quo, such an approach is unlikely to deliver the same benefits.

I’ve recently really been preparing myself to start a home business. Even it only garners enough income that I can cut down my main job to 4 days a week instead of 5, 4 days would still meet insurance requirements. As this job is very physical and labor intensive, that third day off would be glorious and just overall better for my human machine because injuries here aren’t a maybe so much as they are a when. 

I was going to call the bank for a credit increase — nothing too crazy to me but honestly don’t know — from 7.5k to 9k. And then I realized them my interest rate on my credit card is 22.99% which my limited researched tells me is pretty high. (Which is on me for never really noticing or fighting for or shopping around.)

I got this card in 2015 and I think my credit was far poorer then. I am now at 768 and have been in the higher 700s for several years. I make all my payments on time and well over the minimum payment. 

The initial purchase I would be making for this venture is about $4k and then various supplies probably coming to an additional $1k but I wanted some more breathing room for shipping supplies and unforeseen costs as this is my first venture into self-employment. 

What I’m working with probably isn’t great but I figure instead of calling the bank not knowing what I was doing, someone here might be able to give me some insight?

I’m in my early 30’s and I rent. 
My total outstanding debt right now is 11.8k. 3k of which is a school loan that I will be paying off entirely in the next 2 months. The remaining 8k is the lease for my car which isn’t up for another year and 6 months. 

I guess what I’m asking for is — with what I’m working with — is this kind of interest rate typical? Is it worth fighting for my bank to lower it or to open another card with a different bank?

Admittedly, I’ve tried very hard since the mid 2010s to really get my finances on track but I probably still don’t have a great idea what I’m doing.

*""Once there is a legal and regulatory framework, that will make a lot of sense. The fact that bitcoin is completely decentralized will make it more ubiquitous over time, and I think it will be something that the Fed should keep on its balance sheet.""*

&amp;#x200B;

A former top Federal Reserve official was also present at the panel. Randal Quarles, formerly vice chairman at the Fed, let it be known that he does not like Lummis' plan very much. He expects that due to political and economic reasons, the Federal Reserve will change course.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sentiment U.S. lawmakers**

Lummis' statements underline the strong pro-crypto sentiment among U.S. lawmakers. Lummis herself has long been known for her pro-crypto views. She herself began investing in bitcoin back in 2013. At the time, the price of a single bitcoin was around $350. By now we all know that the price of bitcoin has risen to astronomical heights since then. So it's not surprising that Lummis is so complimentary about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

CryptoCurrency,Holding most of your coins on centralized/custodial exchanges will never be beneficial. Can anyone change my mind?,"It's been over a decade of people touting the iconic phrase ""not your keys, not your coins,"" to the point where it's a cliche.

We've seen countless number of hacks, exploits, backdoors, and exit scams from people not being in control of their money.

Worse than that, however, we're seeing more and more government reach into crypto, which means tighter regulations, laws, and crackdowns that these exchanges HAVE to comply with if they want to stay in business.

Regardless of all this, there's still so many people I see on this sub bragging about not only holding their coins on exchanges, but voluntarily locking it up with them for weeks or even months (CRO card, exchange staking, centralized lending, etc.)

So let's put the core principals of cryptocurrency (autonomy, decentralization, ownership of money, peer to peer transactions) aside. Whatever. I'm assuming if you've done any research at all into your investment you know about all these and everything else I mentioned above but do not care. So that narrows it down to these things I assume that you do care about:

1. Profit - you don't care who is in charge of your money as long as they make more of it
2. Sense of security - you feel that your custodian has your best interest in mind, and you trust them more than you trust yourself with your money.
3. Ease of use - It's the path of least resistance. The effort of moving your coins to a non-custodial  wallet is not worth your time

Feel free to comment any others that I couldn't think of but these are probably the big ones.

So let's address these.

1. Profit - First of all there's nothing wrong with trading or on exchanges. The problem is keeping all of your capital on those trading platforms permanently and never taking them off. Next, in terms of income from these platforms, defi platforms have higher apys when it comes to staking, and dex fees for trading are way lower and more transparent than CEXs. There's also yield farming, LP pools, etc. These all provide more upside and potential ROI than any CEX can provide. You may think these come at the cost of having more risk, but the difference is your risk come from the investment itself. You're not putting your trust in people and for-profit companies, you're putting your trust in open sourced code enacted on the blockchain.
2. Security - You think that your custodian is ""insured"" or ""secure"" and that all these bad stories of people losing their money on exchanges will never happen to you right? The only response to that is: you may trust your exchange with your money, but do you trust the Fed? The SEC? the IRS? Or whatever government agency regulates those exchanges in your country? Because those are the people who literally write the rules for what the exchanges can and can't do. And can change those rules at any time.
3. Ease of use - Not much to say about this, this is my opinion: if you don't want to take the time and effort to learn how to protect or manage your own money, then what's the point of being in crypto?

So for those that still hold a majority of their crypto capital on centralized mediums, I just have to ask why? Can anyone show me how it's more beneficial in anyway to hold your coins like this? Curious to see the other side of this argument.

Edit: By me asking ""what's the point of being in crypto?"" in point #3, I'm not asking rhetorically. What is your goal out of crypto if not to be in control of your own money? Honest question.",cryptocurrency,1645222750.0

CryptoCurrency,I have seen so many people say “Buy the dip” but I haven’t seen a single guidance on HOW to buy the dip. My strategy on how to approach a downturn and I would like to hear more about your strategy as well please!,"Previously I have written about DCA strategy + buy the dip. The DCA part does the job of taking out the emotions, and the “buy the dip” is to utilize the time to make your cost basis even lower (DCA down). In a time like this, it’s the worst idea to sell low. If you want to sell and take profits, you would have been doing it way back in Nov or early Dec last year.

Now if you are not selling low, you’re halfway to success. You don’t want to do this:

[Please don't do this!](https://preview.redd.it/os3gs5cl2ri81.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c4abd4339276e9cce8c8e8e5ece18db0993d8bd)

But anyway, today I’d like to talk about **HOW** **to buy the dip**, because I have heard of it so many times here, but no one says how to do.

# The two types of mistakes in a downturn

**Panic buying and run out of fiat too early:** Let’s say you have always wanted to buy more of something but can’t wait, so you go all in the first dip. As usual, the dip will dip lower. You realize you have run out of fiat and hate yourself for missing out lower dips.

**The overly pessimistic:** You listen to a bear on the daily and they said (like in July 2021) BTC is going to $16k or even $12k! You keep waiting in Aug, Sep and realize the market trend has reversed! BTC was going up again. You have missed the chance!

Ideally, you don't want to be either of these types. It's impossible to catch the exact bottom, but even getting 10% close to it as a ""buy the dip"" purchase would be great!

# Look at the big picture

[Market entry cost basis broken by band. Full credit to @ TheRealPlanC on Twitter.](https://preview.redd.it/qoha2can1oi81.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf193efd3a253cb01d1c49b6422eb22d70fe7b05)

As you can see, there are various strong holders with cost basis between $36,380 to $41,872. Failing that, a relatively weaker one of $35,008, then a series of between $32,262 to $33,635. If it goes sub $30,889 there is almost no bull defense until $26,770 – that’s why we frequently hear “for the bear, it will have to trigger all the stop losses all the way down to $27k”. Never say never, but BTC going down to $16k or $12k is quite remote, unless there is an extreme black swan event.

Contrary to the popular belief, it usually takes weeks or months to confirm trend reversal, not a couple of days. Why? Crypto is often regarded as “riskier” than other asset classes, thus in a downturn, it will usually be one of the first to be sold. Thus, on the way back to recovery, it will require tremendous volumes over some time to confirm the trend reversal.

The big picture includes the financial market outside of crypto. The most noticeable is S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and news about interest rate. And then we should not ignore the elephant in the room, such as Russia-Ukraine.

# How low the dip will go? – market indicators

After we know that the market conditions would translate for (at least) several weeks in the “underwater” mode, it’s time to find the support bands. That would be one of the bases for setting price that trigger the dip buying orders.

**Find the support bands:** If you go to Tradingview and select the daily candle for BTCUSD pair, you will find some areas acting as support bands – kind of like a floor that prevents the price being dragged down further.

[Tradingview - BTCUSD pair](https://preview.redd.it/dhh7bq5k2oi81.png?width=1449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbaabf9944f1bb0cffaab9e96750d95ac60958a8)

If you’re not familiar though, several people can tell you the support bands. For example, Ben Cowen recently uploaded a video for the bear case. Sally Ho from Crypto Daily identifies the following downside objectives: $39,927 =&gt; $39,394 =&gt; $38,527 =&gt; $38,316 =&gt; $37,869 =&gt; $35,982 and $35,698 areas. Just now we are testing $39,927!

**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  Usually if RSI is less than 30, it’s a better time to buy. The lower it is, the larger amount I will buy accordingly.

[The most recent time when RSI for BTC fell under 30 is 24 Jan 2022. That's a local low of $33,556. This is from Coindesk.](https://preview.redd.it/lnprbq5g3oi81.png?width=1888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7608e88045bc7b5edac9fef309a48a6bdd0f806f)

There is a website that tracks RSI instantly as well as many other market indicators in which you can track on Investing.com =&gt; indices =&gt; Bitcoin Real Time Technical.

[Investing BTC indicators - you can see RSI is 34.061 now.](https://preview.redd.it/djwimigv3oi81.png?width=823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29774b616e7ccbe78c4c7c81e6dfd5aad766308d)

**Whale watching:**  When you start seeing the whales have started buying, it is also something worth considering. One of my most recent watch is the third largest address. Of course, this is just relative though. Whales make mistakes too, so don't take it as 100% signal.

[Bitinfocharts - the third largest whale. As you can see here, this whale last buy is 274 BTC @ $37,260 on 04 Feb 2022. It has stayed on the sideline in the last 2 weeks.](https://preview.redd.it/sxqq6wf64oi81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7c5bf719a6feb4da193a040eb4d37dc18fd4e13)

# Action: Set reducing buy orders, don’t go all in the first dip

After having an idea about the scope of the dip, it’s time to put into action. The lower the price, the bigger the order. For example, if I use the support bands above.

[Just an example. Again, this is up to your risk averse level. You may say, well my cost basis is $38k so I won’t start buying again until it hits $37,800. But this way you can make sure you still have fiat to buy if the dip goes lower. Never go all in the first dip.](https://preview.redd.it/1r3u2fhk4oi81.png?width=278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddcebcf6d619352eeed5aec83e7dec6b5271ebcf)

**And of course, this is not financial advice, but that’s my strategy, along side dynamic DCA. What is yours? I would like to hear please.**

**Edit:** *1/ This is just an example of how I would approach things, it doesn't mean it will bottom out at $35.7k. No one knows for sure. It may or it may not. May be it goes down to $33.7k. When you buy the dip, you essentially place a chance here: if it doesn't go down further, you lock in some units at the best possible price in the short-term. If it goes down further, you still have fiat left to buy*.

*2/ TA is not useless. TA cannot predict long-term trends because there will be so many externalities in the horizon. But TA helps predict market in the short-term. For example, when BTC broke the $41.9k support band recently, we know things will get worse.* *Therefore, we can prepare fiat accordingly.*

*3/ DCA and ""buy the dip"" are not mutually exclusive. We can combine both strategies to figure out the best. In my opinion, DCA is a ""risk-neutralizing tool"", not necessarily a ""return-maximizing tool"". That's why we use a wide range of market indicators to further enhance our DCA. You don't want to DCA in at $68k when all the market indicators flashed red hot in Oct/Nov last year. You probably wanted to DCA out and buy back for almost 50% discount now.*

*4/ Another website which lists a number of handy indicators is Barchart. Just select the pair BTCUSD. This is known as ""the cheat sheet""*

[Barchart .com - BTCUSD Cheat sheet](https://preview.redd.it/snhxmob86ri81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79d9c472459b35d2388489c12d7f7323e5850852)",cryptocurrency,1645224028.0

stocks,$DKNG + $ARKK - Cathie Woods has LOST IT!!,"I personally find it absolutely frightening the way the interview yesterday unfolded on CNBC with Cathie Woods. Valid counterpoints were made to her investment strategy that were basically undeniable, and she blew smoke and quoted statistics and tried to make it sounded like she was absolutely competent.

Cathie Woods getting into $HOOD has to be the ABSOLUTE bottom for her funds. That stock is an absolute dumpster fire, the worst stock I can think of owning (off the top of my head). $DKNG + $ROKU being the two latest dumpster fires she's hoarding. She's going on about her 5 year strategy (funds won't exist in 5 years I hope for everyone else's sake) while selling Twitter when she bought the position in Nov. '21.

I have five premises here:

**1)** Cathie Woods is NEVER wrong. Even when she's wrong, she's not actually wrong, the MARKET is wrong.

This reminds me of a person who buys a lottery ticket and claims it's the winning ticket, before the numbers come out. Well, the numbers finally do come out and not a single one match! Hah! You're wrong!! Well, the ticket holder digs in deeper, instead of acknowledging his failure, he instead says that the numbers are the winning numbers, however, the lottery draw was rigged. It will be investigated and the true winning numbers (on his ticket) will then be drawn, and he will be a millionaire. You have to understand there are people throughout history who will deny the truth until their death, creating their own alternate reality, and **these people are the most dangerous people of all.**

**Cathie Woods reminds me of a near perfect mirror image of Elizabeth Holmes with Theranos.** Elizabeth Holmes was extremely well spoken, and she absolutely never waivered publicly in regards to her thoughts on performance, the company, the future, etc. She had people believing against their better judgement because of how charismatic she was. **Avoid these people!**

**2)** She's a money grabber!! Look at that expense ratio!! .75!?! I could see that being justified if you took a yearly or monthly draw of .75 annualized based on total returns of the entire fund since the beginning, never taking draws when the funds are in a loss territory. You think she's going to do that?

She's also STARTING NEW FUNDS!!! Her flagship fund has nothing but bagholders, and she wants to start NEW FUNDS! The gall!!!! She's cashing out on her image before it blows up in smoke. She'll be relaxing on a hand-built super-yacht, rest assured, when it's all said and done.

**3)** This follows a bit of #2, but she has absolutely no personal risk, except for the future income stream if her funds shrink into nothing. Her management fees are locked in whether you lose 99.999% of your money with her. It's her money, forever. Car salesmen are compensated on sales. They are paid if they successfully sell a car (make the fund above-market gains). The callousness of getting paid regardless of fund performance is to me, ruthless.

**4)** I remember, after losing quite a bit on the buy-button-removal fiasco with $HOOD related to $BB calls / $BB stock price being in the WSB discord telling people my story. The ones who actually believed I could have lost that much money decided they would fix me. ""Just invest in Cathie Woods $ARKK. She's the kingmaker! You just don't know what you're doing. She will carry you across the finish line."" Must have been 20 people in that chat room and all agreed.

However, I had a quick look at $ARKK's holdings and realized that at that time, February 2021, every stock she'd invested in had gone moon-shot and to make it worse, they all looked like pretty ridiculous stocks to me at the time. Well, after voicing my opinion, I was mocked heavily to the point I began to question my own decision making.

Point being is that someone who has so much charisma, is so well spoken and sounds knowledgeable (Elizabeth Holmes again) are ultimately the ones who convince others to drink the Cool-Aid. They stop thinking rationally about the investments; it becomes cult-like. Be extremely wary when people don't heed your counterpoints regarding stock trades; if they aren't open to obvious holes in their logic, they aren't thinking rationally.

**5)** Finally, she's a religious fanatic. Now, for full disclosure, I am a Christian as well (apologies for bringing up religion), however, she takes it to a dangerous level. I don't care how good my surgeon was, but if I was about to undergo surgery, and my surgeon said he's ""fulfilling the will of God"" by operating on me, I'd be off that table before he finished the sentence. She named her fund after the Ark of the Covenant. Have you guys read what happened to the priests who touched it to prevent it from falling to the ground?!

Money isn't created in a vacuum. In the stock market, there are winners and losers. If you win, someone else lost, for the most part. I don't necessarily want to get into M1 creation by FED pushing up money supply, etc, but basically, if your fund is beating inflation, you took the money from someone(s). How can that be the ""will of God."" Chuck, I know you're my best friend and all, but you have to give me your house and sign over the deed. It's the ""will of God."" God told me!

CryptoCurrency,Fed up Ottawa residents win secret suit to freeze the crypto wallets funding Canada’s ‘Freedom Convoy’ protesters,"***“Don’t keep your funds with any centralized \[or\] regulated custodian. Get your coins \[and\] cash out and only trade P2P \[peer to peer\]. We cannot protect you*****,”** 

via [https://fortune.com/2022/02/18/freedom-convoy-protests-canada-lawsuit-freeze-crypto-wallets-ottawa/](https://fortune.com/2022/02/18/freedom-convoy-protests-canada-lawsuit-freeze-crypto-wallets-ottawa/)

**YVONNE LAUMORE** 

Yesterday, a group of Ottawa residents [won a private class action lawsuit](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-court-freezes-millions-in-cash-cryptocurrency-donated-to/) to freeze [at least 146 cryptocurrency wallets](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/02/17/citizens-group-wins-court-ordered-freeze-of-freedom-convoy-accounts-cryptocurrency.html) and bank assets tied to the main organizers of Canada’s “Freedom Convoy” in a bid to stanch funding for the ongoing demonstrations.

Known as a Mareva injunction, [the lawsuit](https://ottawaconvoyclassaction.ca/order-mareva.pdf) was filed by Ottawa residents Zexi Li, Geoffrey Devaney, and the Happy Goat Coffee business against key convoy organizers including Chris Barber, Benjamin Dichter, Tamara Lich, and Nicholas St. Louis. The hearing was held in private without public notice or access, lawyer Paul Champ who represents the residents bringing the suit, told [*The Star,* ](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/02/17/citizens-group-wins-court-ordered-freeze-of-freedom-convoy-accounts-cryptocurrency.html)[a Toronto-headquartered Canadian newspaper](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/02/17/citizens-group-wins-court-ordered-freeze-of-freedom-convoy-accounts-cryptocurrency.html)[*.*](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/02/17/citizens-group-wins-court-ordered-freeze-of-freedom-convoy-accounts-cryptocurrency.html) Li earlier this month won an injunction which [barred protesters from honking their horns](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/zexi-li-ottawa-injunction-trucker-protest-convoy-1.6344503) in downtown Ottawa.

The suit is unprecedented for the country, as it’s the “first time in Canada that a Mareva injunction \[has\] ever been used to freeze cryptocurrency,” says Matthew Burgoyne, a crypto- and blockchain-focused partner at Calgary-based McLeod Law. He added that the injunction was a powerful legal “remedy which can have significant consequences for a defendant.” The defendants weren’t given advance notice of the suit, says Champ.

Champ, who hired a private investigator and cryptocurrency expert, found that the organizers’ crypto movements outpaced the government’s attempts to track them, according to [*The Star.*](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/02/17/citizens-group-wins-court-ordered-freeze-of-freedom-convoy-accounts-cryptocurrency.html)

Under the injunction, the named defendants, and those affiliated with them, are restricted from moving fiat and cryptocurrency assets in the bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets specifically named in the suit. The respondents must now respond to the court and “submit to an examination under oath” regarding their assets and what the assets have been used for. The Mareva injunction is only used when there’s a “high risk” that the defendant will “dispose, encumber or…remove its assets from the jurisdiction during the course of litigation,” says Burgoyne. It effectively freezes their assets until judgment is passed.

If the defendants breach the order, they could be fined, given jail time, or subject to asset seizure. Should individuals help any of the named defendants in breaching the order, they could also face penalties or be imprisoned, says the suit.

The injunction comes amid [Canadian authorities’ sweeping crackdown on the Freedom Convoy protests,](https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/canada-freedom-convoy-protests-whats-happening/) which began in late January and have cost the country hundreds of millions in trade, policing costs, and city services each day the demonstrations have occurred. On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [invoked the Emergencies Act](https://fortune.com/2022/02/14/canadian-prime-minister-trudeau-emergencies-act-freedom-convoy-protests/) for the first time in the country’s history, giving law enforcement authorities greater power to clamp down on demonstrators.

Late last evening, [Ottawa police arrested several key protest organizers](http://xn--8ug/), including Lich and Barber, on charges of mischief. By Friday morning, armed police officers backed by armored tactical vehicles descended on downtown Ottawa in a [major push to clear protesters and trucks](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-police-set-to-begin-massive-operation-in-ottawa-to-remove-convoy/) from the city.

Although the Mareva injunction is new, Canadian authorities have targeted the convoy protesters’ funds in other ways.

Earlier this week, Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) ordered all FINTRAC-regulated firms to stop transactions with 34 cryptocurrency wallets, which [received 20 Bitcoin (BTC), or nearly $900,000,](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/canada-sanctions-34-crypto-wallets-tied-to-trucker-freedom-convoy/) for the protesters. The majority of cryptocurrency exchanges which operate in the country are regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). Canada’s TD Bank also [froze two personal accounts](https://globalnews.ca/news/8615490/td-bank-freezes-accounts-trucker-convoy/) that received over $1 million for the protesters, and crowdfunding platform [GoFundMe shut down a donation campaign](https://fortune.com/2022/02/08/freedom-truckers-canada-bitcoin-lifeline-after-gofundme-freezes-donations/) for the truckers after discussions with authorities.

Jesse Powell, cofounder and CEO of Kraken—one of the [world’s top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges)—and a staunch supporter of the Freedom Convoy, warned protesters yesterday that his platform will be “forced to comply” with Canadian authorities. “Don’t keep your funds with any centralized \[or\] regulated custodian. Get your coins \[and\] cash out and only trade P2P \[peer to peer\]. We cannot protect you,” [Powell tweeted.](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1494462097161220104?s=20&amp;t=t-ScPDIRRyYsYIkBexEwsA)

Powell [previously donated](https://fortune.com/2022/02/08/freedom-truckers-canada-bitcoin-lifeline-after-gofundme-freezes-donations/) to a Bitcoin fundraiser for the protesters organized by a group called HonkHonkHodl. “Mandates are immoral. End the madness,” he [wrote on the fundraising page.](https://tallyco.in/) The BTC fundraising campaign, which Powell contributed to, ended earlier this week after reaching its goal of amassing 21 Bitcoin (BTC), or around $929,134, the campaign organizers [announced on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) One of HonkHonkHodl’s founders, who goes by the name NobodyCaribou on [Twitter](https://fortune.com/company/twitter) (and who’s named in the suit as Nicholas St. Louis), says the group [distributed 14.6 BTC to 90 truckers](https://twitter.com/NobodyCaribou/status/1494524997515292673) earlier this week via an “epic P2P Bitcoin wallet airdrop.”

Yet the authorities’ actions may only have a minimal effect on the protesters’ crypto funds, particularly if they are using “unhosted” wallets disconnected from the internet or a cryptocurrency exchange. This method of transferring crypto peer-to-peer means that the assets are stored in “noncustodial” wallets, which, Burgoyne says, “keeps \[the assets\] insulated from…a government or bank.”

The protest organizers can easily transfer crypto to new wallets, where assets can be cashed out in Canadian dollars via an exchange. Burgoyne doesn’t believe that the government will start tracking historical wallet transactions, but even if it did, owners could use crypto “mixers” like Tornado Cash to “wash” their funds, hiding their digital trails on the blockchain.

Burgoyne argues that using such “self-hosted” wallets means that it will be “very difficult, if not impossible” for Canadian authorities to actually freeze protesters’ crypto assets.",cryptocurrency,1645235511.0

# **Russia’s Ukraine threat and worries on Fed rate hikes could make for a turbulent week in markets - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/russias-ukraine-threat-worries-on-fed-rate-hikes-could-make-for-a-turbulent-week-in-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market faces another turbulent week, as investors watch the situation in Ukraine and continue to adjust portfolios ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Stocks were rocked in both directions in the past week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing its worst day of the year Thursday. The three major averages were lower for the week with the Dow off 1.9%, the Nasdaq down 1.7%, and the S&amp;P 500 down 1.6%. Energy, communications services and financials were the worst-performing sectors for the week.
*****
&gt; A few Fed speakers are on the calendar in the four-day week ahead, including Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Christopher Waller Thursday. Earnings continue to roll in, including reports from retailers Macy’s and Home Depot. There are also a number of economic reports, including durable goods, consumer spending and inflation data.
*****
&gt; “Maybe the biggest issue [for the market] next week is technical,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; The market continued to fluctuate with developments surrounding Russia’s threat to invade Ukraine and its buildup of troops along the Ukraine border.
*****
&gt; “The problem with Russia, is what’s the end game? It could just go on forever … When you look ahead, the thing that’s going to change this is if they go in or there’s a total pullout, and what’s going to bring a pullout any time soon,” Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; He said stocks had looked set to break out higher before Russia’s threat against Ukraine started to weigh on the market. About two weeks ago, the S&amp;P 500 tried to retake 4,600 after touching a low of 4,222 on Jan. 24.
*****
&gt; “It was doing that despite all the Fed stuff and inflation. The market was OK with it. Russia brought it all down. Now you are in a situation where if we break low enough, we have to break that low,” said Paulsen.
*****
&gt; On Friday, Russia prepared to carry out more drills near Ukraine’s border, while the U.S. continued to press for a diplomatic solution. After the market close, President Joe Biden said he is convinced Russia has decided to attack in coming days.
*****
&gt; “As an investor, that leaves you hanging there, and technically you have to wonder if we’re going down to test that low,” said Paulsen. “I don’t know about the next 60 days, but the next six months should be good.”
*****
&gt; Chart analysis is not guaranteed to predict the path of the market, but many investors set their sights on key technical levels since so many investors react to them and algorithms are programmed around them. They also become a guide when fundamentals are very uncertain.
*****
&gt; # Watching the charts
Scott Redler, chief strategic officer at T3Live.com, watches the short-term technicals. He sees a good chance that the S&amp;P 500 revisits that January low in a retest. The S&amp;P 500 ended Friday at 4,348.
*****
&gt; “The narrative for this year is inflation, and the Fed removing accommodation. We may get a knee-jerk reaction on the Russia-Ukraine situation,” said Redler. He said even if the Russian threat fades, the market could still face volatility as the Fed moves to raise interest rates starting in March.
*****
&gt; “That doesn’t solve the problem of four to seven rate hikes this year and the runoff of the balance sheet,” he said, adding the market has responded negatively to Fed tightening in the past. “In 2018, the S&amp;P fell 20% and the Nasdaq fell 24%. So why wouldn’t the S&amp;P test the 4,222 area?”
*****
&gt; Redler and other technical analysts are watching a bearish pattern on the chart of the S&amp;P 500 that would suggest the index could form a “head-and-shoulders” pattern, which could bring even more volatility.
*****
&gt; “It’s a distribution pattern, which is what the market’s been doing over the past month as it builds the right shoulder,” said Redler. He said the neckline on the chart wou
*****
&gt; ld be around 4,220 to 4,280. “After it forms, you get lower prices if the neckline breaks.” In that case, he said the broad-market index could fall to 3,900, he added.
*****
&gt; Redler is also watching the charts of Big Tech stocks. “Apple has been an island where it’s not acting special, but it’s not breaking down. If Apple starts to break the 166-ish area, it would help to bring the S&amp;P down faster,” he said. “Apple’s been trying to hold the $165 to $170 area, which keeps it somewhat constructive.”
*****
&gt; Microsoft shares are also holding up. “Apple and Microsoft are such a high percentage of the S&amp;P and the Dow. In order for the bears to really growl, they’re going to have to break those two down, in addition to the high growth names,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Flight to safety
&gt; In the bond market, investors have been weighing Federal Reserve rate hikes against worries about a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.93% Friday. Yields move opposite price. Investors have been looking to the 10-year as a safe haven against possible weekend developments in Ukraine.
*****
&gt; A week earlier, the market was anxious about the possibility the Fed would be more aggressive with interest rate hikes, starting with a possible 50-basis-point hike in March. But in the futures market, expectations for a half-point rate increase faded as the week wore on. The market was pricing in just about a quarter-point hike Friday.
*****
&gt; St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had raised expectations for a bigger hike, and he reiterated that view Monday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Then the minutes from the Fed’s last meeting were released Wednesday. They were less hawkish than expected, with no indication that the Federal Open Market Committee members favored a bigger rate hike.
*****
&gt; “I think based on what we heard from the minutes and everyone except for Bullard, it doesn’t seem anyone really favors a 50-basis point hike,” said Ben Jeffery, rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
*****
&gt; As for economic data in the coming week, there are a few important reports including durable goods and consumer sentiment Friday.
*****
&gt; Personal consumption expenditures data is also expected Friday. Investors will be focused on the inflation reading in that report, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; “We kind of have a pretty good guide that that’s going to come in ahead of expectations. It’s probably the highlight of the week, as far as the data goes,” said John Briggs of NatWest Markets.
*****
&gt; # Boiling oil
&gt; The tense situation with Moscow has driven oil prices higher because of concerns that any retaliatory sanctions from the U.S. could limit Russian oil on the market. West Texas Intermediate futures rose above $95 per barrel in the past week for the first time in seven years. But by Friday, the priced retreated to about $91.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the market reacted more to reports that the U.S. and Iran appeared close to a deal Friday to revive a nuclear agreement. If the deal is reinstated, Iran would be able to release its crude oil on to the global market.
*****
&gt; “There’s a lot of positive commentary around it. There seems to be a conclusion in the market. It’s a marriage of convenience. The market needs the barrels. The Biden administration needs the barrels, and the Iranians need the money,” said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital.
*****
&gt; Kilduff said traders are watching the earnings reports from oil companies in the next week, with the most important being Occidental Petroleum. EOG Resources, NRG, Chesapeake Energy and Coterra Energy will also post results.
*****
&gt; With U.S. drilling rig counts increasing, Kilduff said investors are watching to see if companies report plans to increase drilling.
*****
&gt; “What are their capex plans going to be is a hot topic of conversation,” he said.

&gt; # Up 7 of Last 10 After Presidents’ Day – Longer Term Still Weak

&gt; DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all up 7 of the last 10 years on the day after the Presidents’ Day market holiday with average gains ranging from 0.12% for DJIA and 0.39% for NASDAQ. In our February 2022 Strategy Calendar for newsletter subscribers shows conflicting indications for this Tuesday, February 22, the day after Presidents’ Day. Over the most recent 21-year history this 15th trading of February has been down more than 60% of the time for S&amp;P 500 with average loss of -0.27% earning the day our “Angry Bear” icon.

&gt; Earlier this we noted the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. As you can see in the table here the days after has improved the past 10 years but the Wednesday after has not enjoyed the same turnaround and both days still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 14 losses for median gain of 0.11% but with an average loss of –0.22%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 19 of 32 years with an average loss of –0.48% and a median loss of –0.21%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 32 with an average loss of –0.06% and a median decline of –0.03%. S&amp;P 500 is down 19 of 32, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 18 of 32, average –0.03%, median –0.14%.

&gt; # Diminishing Relative Strength For The US

&gt; In 2021 US equities, using the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) as a proxy, outperformed emerging markets (EEM) by 32.5 percentage points (ppts). That performance spread fell just short of 2013 when the performance spread was 35.4 percentage points (ppts). After 2013, SPY also outperformed EEM for each of the following three years by an average of 11.8% (median: 17.3%). Notably, we are currently on a streak of another four consecutive years of SPY outperforming EEM, which is tied with the period from 2013 through 2016 for the longest streak on record since EEM began trading in July of 2003. So far this year, SPY has traded down by 7.1% while EEM has gained 1.3%, thus resulting in a performance spread of 8.5 ppts.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/annual-performance-spy-vs-eem-021722-3.png))**

&gt; The start to 2022 has been tough for US equities relative to emerging markets, but what, if anything, does this mean for performance in the remainder of the year? Today (2/17) is the 33rd trading day of 2022, and since 2004, SPY actually only outperformed EEM at this point on a YTD basis 36.8% of the time. When EEM has outperformed SPY in the first 33 trading days of the year, the average rest of year performance spread has been -3.4 ppts (median: -5.6 ppts), meaning that EEM tends to continue outperforming for the rest of the year. While SPY tended to underperform, which one performed better for the remainder of the year was basically a coinflip as EEM only outperformed a little bit more than half of the time (54.5%). In terms of relative performance at this point in the year, 2022 ranks as one of the worst on record, second only to 2006 when SPY underperformed by 8.5 ppts. In 2006, EEM continued to outperform gaining 15.6% for the rest of the year compared to a 9.9% gain for SPY.

&gt; Since 2004, there have only been four years where SPY traded down from the close on the 33rd trading day of the year through year-end, and three of those occurrences were in years where SPY underperformed EEM in the first 33 trading days. When EEM outperforms SPY by over 4% in the first 33 trading days, the average rest of year performance for SPY has been a gain of 10.6% (median: 9.9%) and 10.0% (median: 15.6%) for EEM. Neither of these performance numbers differs all that much from the median rest of year returns in all years since 2004.

&gt; The chart below shows the relative strength of SPY vs EEM and European equities, as measured by the iShares Europe ETF (IEV) over the last six months where a rising line indicates outperformance of US stocks while a falling line indicates underperformance. Relative to both ETFs, US stocks are still outperforming over the last six months, but there was a clear shift in performance that began late in 2021, and both EEM and IEV are outperforming SPY.

&gt; Within the emerging markets group, Brazil (EWZ), South Africa (EZA), and Hong Kong (EWH) have been the strongest performers YTD, gaining 18.0%, 14.2%, and 6.0%, respectively. Of all of the countries we tracked that are classified as emerging markets, only one has underperformed the US YTD: Russia (ERUS). ERUS is down 8.2% YTD as the prospects of devastating sanctions from a potential invasion of Ukraine have been increasingly priced in.

&gt; # Revisiting the Biggest Winners and Losers Since the COVID Crash Low

&gt; In a little over a month on 3/23/22, we'll be exactly two years removed from the stock market's COVID Crash closing low. Below we show how the average stock that's currently in the S&amp;P 1500 has done since the 3/23/20 low by sector. Stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are up an average of 155% since the COVID Crash low. By far the best performing sector has been Energy where the average stock is up 393%. Consumer Discretionary stocks are up the second most on average at +233.5%, while Materials stocks rank third with an average gain of 180.6%. Notably, stocks in the Financials and Technology sectors are both up roughly the same on average since 3/23/20 with gains of 148% and 145%, respectively. Three sectors have average gains of less than 100%: Consumer Staples (+94.4%), Communication Services (+89%), and Utilities (+42.9%). Note that these results are only based on price change, so higher dividend-paying sectors like Utilities are up more on a total return basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/spxavg0215.png))**

&gt; There are currently 59 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 up more than 500% from their closing level on 3/23/20, and there are 11 up more than 1,000%. GameStop (GME) remains at the top of the list with a gain of 3,042%, followed by SM Energy (SM) and Matador Resources (MTDR) with gains of more than 2,000%. Aluminum-maker Alcoa (AA) is the best performing Materials stock on the list with a gain of 1,160% since 3/23, rising from $5.67/share up to $71.45 as of this morning. The average share price of the 11 stocks that are up 1,000%+ was just $4.42 on 3/23/20. Their average share price now is $66.78!

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is by far the largest company on the list of best performers with a market cap of more than $900 billion at the moment. Back on 3/23/20, Tesla (TSLA) shares closed at $86.86. Since then, the stock has gained 944%, putting shares above the $900 level.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/best-since.png))**

&gt; There are 56 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 1500 whose price today is lower than it was at the close on 3/23/20. Below are the 35 stocks that are down at least 10% in price since then. eHealth (EHTH) and Tabula Rasa (TRHC) have been the worst two with declines of more than 80%. Another three are down more than 50% (QURE, STRA, IVR), while 16 more are down 20%+. The two stocks on the list of worst performers with the largest markets caps at the moment are Gilead (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB). These two stocks performed well in the very early days of COVID, but they've been trending lower ever since and currently trade at the same levels they were at in mid to late 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/worst-since.png))**

&gt; Clorox (CLX) is an interesting name to see on the list of worst performers. When COVID first hit, there was a run on disinfectant products like bleach that Clorox manufactures. (Remember trying to find Clorox wipes throughout the first half of 2020? They were nowhere to be found!)

&gt; The supply/demand imbalance pushed shares of Clorox (CLX) sharply higher from January to August 2020, but since then shares have steadily trended lower and lower, and they're now right back to where they were trading in early January 2020. Normally, we see stocks ""take the stairs up and the elevator down,"" but the two-year chart for Clorox looks like the opposite: it took the elevator up when COVID first hit, and it has taken the stairs down ever since.

&gt; # How Many Seats Could The Democrats Lose In November?

&gt; One of the most popular questions we’ve received lately is what could happen in the upcoming midterm election? Although we are a long way away from Election Day, it is important to note that a new president has historically lost about 30 House seats in the midterm election. With the Democrats holding a historically small majority in the House currently, a swing this size would of course give the Republicans control.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.16.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; “Yes, history would say the Republicans likely gain control of the House and very well could gain the Senate as well,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Coming into midterms the party that lost the presidential election is usually more motivated party, gaining close to 30 House seats going back to Woodrow Wilson in 1914.”

&gt; How does this all play out for your investments? We do expect Republicans to take the House right now, resulting in something close to a gridlocked Congress. What happens if Republicans take both the House and Senate? “The good news is one of the best scenarios for stocks is a Democratic President and Republican controlled Congress. In fact, the late 1990s saw that same scenario and it was one of the best times for investors ever,” added Detrick.

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, a Republican controlled Congress with a Democratic President has been quite kind for investors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.16.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; One potential issue is President Biden’s low approval rating. With his current Gallup approval rating hovering near 40%, this extrapolates out to potentially losing 50 seats in the House. Thanks to our friends from Strategas Research Partners for help with this chart.

&gt; But let’s remember the election is a long way off still and a lot could still happen. However Congress shapes up, there will be many checks and balances in place so what either party can do may be limited to areas where there’s bipartisan agreement.

&gt; Here are two more important midterm charts. First up, midterm years have seen the largest intra-year pullbacks, down more than 17% on average, but the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained more than 30% a year off those lows. In other words, don’t panic if we get some normal midterm volatility, it could be an opportunity for longer-term investors.

&gt; Lastly, early in a midterm year stocks historically are quite weak. It isn’t until the election is over and the uncertainty is alleviated until a rally typically takes place. Every year is different, but maybe the weakness early in 2022 shouldn’t be a big surprise.

personalfinance,Unable to pay Private Student Loans,"Hello all I was wondering if anyone had any tips of advice for me. Long story short I graduated college about 2 years ago and had to take out my education in all student loans. I currently have ~37,000 in Federal loans and $250,000 in private loans (55000 of this balance is interest charges.) my biggest issue is that I have not been able to pay my loans for the last 2 years do to job instability in my career field and have had them in forbearance and they are now coming out. My monthly payment is $1975 on just the private loan and will earn around $54,000 before taxes in the next year. I do have a co-signer as well, but they unfortunately are barely able to pay their month to month expenses due to losing a job and just starting a new one about 14 months later. What are some options for me? I did contact my lender PHEAA, but they essentially told me that I have to pay 100% or they’ll be reported as being late then into default if it goes on longer than 90 days I think. Has anyone been in this situation? Also my education was to be a pilot if anyone is wondering why I have so much debt at an undergraduate level. I definitely would appreciate any tips or advice! Thanks",finance,1645246454.0
personalfinance,I need advice for Avalanche method and lump sum pre payment before May 31st,"Student loan avalanche question. I have multiple loans all adding to roughy 175000. Yes it’s a lot … and a lump sum in my savings due to Covid postponement of payments. 8 total loans with different interest rates. I am aware of the avalanche and snowball method. However, my question is if I can pay off 3 loans now and then start the avalanche method, which 3 should I pay off? I know two make since to me. High interest and high principle. However the scenario below is tough for me. 

For simple math, should I pay off the $16 (7.6%) or the $29 (6.3%) with the last of my lump sum up front payment before starting avalanche?

He's a legendary investor at Wall Street.   
This man was named the head of the **Magellan Fund** at 1977 when he was 33 years old, which had $18 million in assets. He ran it for 13 yearsm, which allowed him to retire at 1990 at the age of 46, when the fund had grown to over $14 **billion** in assets. The fund annualized return was at  29.2%, more than twice the S&amp;P 500 at that time - which means that he **consistently beat** the market.

After his retirement, this legendary investor switched to philantropy and only managed his own stocks.

So, I'm reading Peter Lynch's book called ""Beating The Street"", where he talks about his investiments strategies, the way he thought during critical momments and the market and so on. 

While I was reading, I've found this:

&amp;#x200B;

And then he proceed to argument that in many times that apparently the world would end, the market had some big crashes and then recovered and everyone was fine. 

This made me think about the whole situation we are now. I mean, there's Putin going berserker at Ukraine, Biden saying that Putin certainly will attack it, interest rates going up, COVID has a new variant, truckers at Canada and Trudeau being mad...... basically, we are all gonna die.

Or maybe we are not gonna die and we'll be fine. We might even be missing some buying opportunities. 

To finalize this post, I'd like to quote Peter Lynch again:

We will all be fine. Just turn off the TVs and analyze this situation clearly.

The cryptocurrency was referred to as “Project Pisces”. Mystique Inc hired two RDX veterans, though it was unclear whether they were hired specifically to work on the crypto project. Mystique Inc registered “Pisces Networks” as a new company in Geneva, Switzerland.
The BBC reported that Mystique Inc had intended to roll out a stablecoin in several countries in the first half of 2019. The Financial Times added that Mystique Inc was in talks with RDX and Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets. Mystique Inc was also reported to have held talks with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) about its stablecoin initiative. The Information reported that Mystique Inc would introduce Pisces to the world in the following weeks. Mystique Inc’s Head of Financial Services for Northern Europe, Paula Hudson, confirmed its stablecoin would be pegged to a basket of currencies rather than just one. Later in June 2019, It was reported that Uber, PayPal, Visa, Stripe, Mercado Libre, Bookings.com and Mastercard would be backing Mystique Inc’s new crypto.
Mystique Inc launched Project Pisces with an ambitious vision of a decentralized, autonomous organization to oversee the project and would be a borderless, easy to transfer means of exchange. Mystique Inc stated that its participation with Pisces would be through its new Dragon subsidiary, which would build a digital wallet for the project, but it also intended to limit its role otherwise. The project would be headed by the Pisces Association, a group of 28 companies – that would later grow to at least 100 – and oversee the token’s development and receive returns through the Pisces Investment Token.
However, in July 2019, U.S. lawmakers called for an immediate halt to Pisces’s development until they better understood the project. Mystique Inc confirmed that they were yet to respond to the previously mentioned U.S. Senate Banking Committee letter. Things started to worsen as US regulators started imposing a halt on the development of project Pisces citing reasons with respect to the stability of the monetary policy, concerns that Pisces can be used for criminal activities and the like. Multiple notices were issued to Mystique Inc. regarding the same. More U.S. lawmakers called on Pisces to halt development. Robin Shwarts, in defence, wrote an open letter to clarify what he called “misunderstandings” about Pisces and confirmed that he would testify before the U.S. Senate Banking and the U.S. House Financial Services committees. Shwarts also responded to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee’s questions and attempted to reassure the lawmakers that Mystique Inc will not link personal information with Pisces transactions. Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, said that Pisces cannot launch until questions about its operations were answered, citing concerns around financial stability and consumer protection. U.S. Treasury Secretary said that he was “not comfortable” with Pisces, adding it could be misused by criminal entities.
Mystique Inc revealed the list of fiat currencies comprising Pisces’s basket: The U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling and the Singapore dollar. U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Sigal Mandelker, warned Pisces – and other cryptos –
     
           that they must comply with existing law. Pisces was receiving mixed responses from different parts of the world. Some in favour of the organization, some against.
In 2019, The Bank for International Settlements announced that its Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure – which included at least 26 central banks – would question the Pisces Association on its stablecoin. Robin Shwarts responded again by debunking the claim that Pisces was a threat to monetary sovereignty or economic stability.
Mystique Inc revealed the full breakdown of the basket backing Pisces: 50 percent USD, 18 percent EUR, 14 percent JPY, 11 percent GBP, 7 percent SGD. Lucas Geiger, Co-founder of Wireline, announced that the U.S. Senators warned Visa, Mastercard and Stripe that they might see heightened regulatory scrutiny if they continued working on Pisces and that they should discontinue their association with them quickly. Due to the pressure, Mastercard, Visa, Mercado Pago, Booking Holdings, eBay and Stripe withdrew from the Pisces Association. Ted Carlsberg, CEO of Mystique Inc. testified before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. Ted Carlsberg told lawmakers that Pisces could bring financial services to 1.7 billion unbanked individuals, in remarks prepared ahead of testimony before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. After Ted’s address, 21 companies signed the Pisces Association charter, which formally created the governing council for the stablecoin initiative and elected an executive board.
In 2020, Pisces Association’s Head of Policy and Communication, Dante Disparte, said Pisces was trying to address the issues of mass adoption and solve for frictionless payments, two attributes that would make it a better means of payment than bitcoin. Mystique Inc intended to decentralize finance and business by 2030 as conveyed by CEO Ted Carlsberg in the vision statement. While he mentioned that the social media platform intended to pursue digital payments, he did not mention Pisces. The Pisces Association announced that it had formed a technical steering committee, helmed by representatives from five of its member entities, which would oversee the development of the technical roadmap and build a developer community.
Swiss government officials said they were optimistic and remained open to the possibility that Pisces would receive their approval to launch. At the same time, a company in the association outlined a number of concerns he had about Pisces, like whether it would become inextricably linked to the proprietary Dragon wallet, who could use it and whether the Pisces Association members would receive returns. The Financial Stability Board published a consultation report in which it advised the global financial regulators on how they might be able to address stablecoin projects like Pisces. Based on this, the Pisces Association revamped its white paper and pulled back from its original vision, it announced that rather than a single stablecoin backed by a basket of assets it would now be looking to issue a series of stablecoins backed by a single asset each. It still intended to issue a basket-backed coin in some form, but the new look remained a major concession to policy makers concerned by the project. Meanwhile, Dragon rebranded itself as Ony, Mystique Inc announced in a blog post highlighting the feature to function interoperably with the Chitthi and Bonjour platforms. Ony became one of 12 crypto start-ups which received clearance to operate in Hawaii under a regulatory sandbox. Blockchain Capital, one of the oldest investment firms in the crypto space, joined the Pisces Association, making its network of industry figures available to the organization. Pisces intended to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin as soon as January 2021, pending regulatory approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).
In 2021, The Pisces Association rebranded the entire project as the ""Sparrow Association"" as part of an effort to distance itself from the original multi-currency basket vision. CEO Bob Bradley, said that the
   
           group was ready to launch a token, but was waiting on approval from FINMA. The Sparrow Association partnered with crypto custodian Fireblocks and payments platform First Digital Assets as part of its effort to launch a scaled-down version of its stablecoin. CNBC reported that Sparrow remained committed to launching a pilot project sometime in the year. At the time it was still in talks with Swiss regulators to acquire a payment license. Silvergate Bank partnered with the Sparrow Association to launch a permissioned, dollar-pegged stablecoin, with Silvergate acting as the token’s issuer and reserve manager.
Ony, Mystique Inc’s digital wallet subsidiary, announced that it would launch a pilot program in the U.S. and Guatemala in partnership with Paxos and Sparrow Association member RDX. Users would be able to purchase Paxos Dollars (USDP) through Ony, deposit the funds at RDX and transfer between wallets. U.S. Senators ordered Mystique Inc to discontinue its Ony pilot, reiterating concerns about Mystique’s history with data privacy. Mystique Inc rebranded to Lucid, named after the idea of the “lucid world” an immersive, digital-analogue to the world that would serve as an expansion of the internet experience. Robert Shwarts announced he would leave Lucid at the end of the year, stepping away from Sparrow and Ony alike.
In 2022, Lucid announced that it would launch a “limited trial” of the Ony digital wallet within its messaging platform Bonjour, an instant messaging and calling application, another Lucid subsidiary. Like Ony’s another pilot, Bonjour would use USDP, not the still yet-to-be-launched Sparrow. A leading news terminal reported that the Sparrow Association was contemplating a sale of its assets, including intellectual property and technology, to refund its investors. Silvergate Bank emerged as the probable purchaser of Sparrow’s assets, according to the Wall Street Journal. Silvergate would reportedly pay $200 million for the assets, but it was not clear whether Sparrow would shut down operations following the sale. The Sparrow Association confirmed to the news terminal that it was selling its assets to Silvergate Bank and beginning the process of shutting down.
 Sparrow also revealed that they would end its talks with Swiss regulators and withdraw from Switzerland
 entirely.
 It has been argued by commentators for some time now that stablecoins are the next evolution of money rather than the major crypto networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum and NFTs. The word around the market is “We need to manage risks to competition, there is the potential for some firms to swiftly achieve dominance and crowd out other players, due to their ability to scale and plug into existing online services. We believe the case for intervention in the wider cryptocurrency markets is less immediately pressing.”
Ultimately, the true effect of Sparrow’s impact on the public and blockchain depends on its final form and, for the time being, we can only wait and see.
Instead of being mere spectators, step into the shoes of the leadership of Lucid-world and Sparrow
 Association and suggest a recovery plan to get the company’s crypto-currency on the map and make it a worldwide sensation. Your solution must include propositions for the following but not limited to -

I’ve done life style changes to help save such as I dropped smoking, eating out, don’t buy expensive clothes, cut my hair short to not spend money getting it done, limit driving (only to jobs and back). I also invested in a MacBook so that I could teach myself how to code. I purchased some courses on Udemy, follow developers on twitters, and watch YouTube vids, and listen to podcasts.

personalfinance,Pay off wife’s car early or wait and use extra cash for down payment on second car?,"So we have roughly $6500 to drop for a down payment on a vehicle we want. The vehicle we’re looking at is a Ford Bronco Sport. We owe $8500 on her vehicle (Nissan Sentra) and the payment for her car is $222 monthly, insurance for both vehicles combined full coverage is $135 monthly ($77 with just her car). I wanted a payment below or at $500 and with the down payment as mentioned I believe this is reasonable barring interest rates being in my favor. (I’ll go as high as $525 monthly). 

My question.. is it advantages to payoff the wife’s car in full, lowering our monthly insurance and just only paying the Bronco monthly carrying full coverage just for the Bronco and liability for the Sentra?

Without the down payment on the Bronco I’m probably looking at $700 out the door (makes me want to throw up owning a car at that price point) but if our insurance lowers to say sub $100 then I believe it makes sense. But wanted a second opinion, thank you for any and all input.

Also, I do not need advice on if I should do this or not. I understand vehicles are poor investments, however safety ratings with a future child on our minds is a significant reason for this choice.

Comparison: The FED is printing more and more money and there comes Inflation: Because there is    more money, your money has less worth. It's the same with real estate.

The population is decreasing, less people need real estate. → There is more real estate than usual and prices decrease.

This behavior could be more common in the future, because experts say there is a population peak in 2064, due to decreasing new borns. The scenario will be the same as in Italy, there will be the same amount of houses for 9.5 Billion as for 9.8 Billion, leaving more houses unused and prices decrease.

These vesting periods are typically in order of 6 months, year or two years... Depends on how well they haggled their position. Now the interesting experiment will begin. If the FED raises the interest rates (as we know they will) venture capitalists will have to reduce their most risky position i.e. crypto. This is why the entire crypto and stock market is tanking to some extent. This also means that VC backed chains will see bigger selloffs when their vesting periods end and prices of those coins will take a bigger hit.

personalfinance,HELP! Bought a used car and need help!,"Hey guys so I recently got into a terrible car accident and had my car totaled. With that being said, I did get paid out but still owed 8k to Toyota so my insurance took care of that and sent me a decent amount of money to obviously go towards a new one. I was told to look for cars on Craigslist, Mom and pop shops or to do my research all around. I had bought a car before so I figured this time I would be smarter and make a better decision. With that being said, the car market right now is TERRIBLE and they are upcharging on just about anything. 

I found a really good deal on a 2018 Toyota Rav 4 XLE at 27k (Which is low in my area compared to other prices/ dealerships) with 20,349 miles on it. I was super stoked because that was a decent price and I know Toyota holds its value but I also know it’s a little over priced for a 4 year old vehicle. I had originally said no to the VSA insurance but of course with all of the recent technology on the vehicle and it being push to start, the finance guy did make sense saying I’d probably have to buy all these sensors and it would be more out of pocket than if I got this insurance. I fell for it and ended up getting a 5 year one for 3k which after doing my research and looking over my paper work I know was the stupidest mistake ever. I tried to haggle with them to bring it down a little lower but I wasn’t really too pushy since I just wanted the car and get out of there already. 

Now I’m ready to go back and cancel it with a verbal promise that I have “90 days”. No where in the contract states 90 days but does say 60 so I am hoping to be able to cancel that by tomorrow morning. I was charged a 5.3 % interest rate because my credit is horrible. I even put 4K as a down payment and my payments ended up being almost $500 a month. I know, absurd for it not being a new car. I feel totally lost and scammed because on the paper work it says subtotal was at around 35k. With my 4K down, it says amount financed is at 31k. Overlooking it all, I noticed it said total sale price ended up being 41k. Can someone overlook my paperwork and see what my options are now? I don’t understand why it says 41k an then says e (estimate). Did I end up getting the car for 31 or 41 and where did my 4K go towards? I was so eager to get approved for a car I totally realized I fucked up. The dude didn’t even offer me the option to buy the used vehicle contract agreement but did give me debt cancellation agreement. I am trying to see my best choice to do right now and my plan was to fix my credit up and end up refinancing in about 6-12 months. Am I totally fucked and was a complete dumbass to signing these papers or is there still some hope I can go back to the dealership and cancel that? Can someone overlook my paper work and see what the hell happened? I know I totally got ripped off and would’ve been better off getting a 2019 model at probably the same price. Any advice on what I should do? I wish I could upload the paper work but if anyone has any advice please let me know.

personalfinance,Do I Buy or Rent and How Much? Single 30,"Hello. I have been doing a lot of research recently on what I should do with housing. I recently received my rent increase and I was blown away at the 30% increase and the market seems to be skyrocketing in the areas surrounding where I work and live. I currently have a very stable federal job and career in Atlanta making $102k per year (increasing to 110k in a few months) with no debt and up to $100k for a downpayment. I contribute at a base 5% to my 401k for the 5% match (recently has been around the cap of 20k) and have a pension that will be worth about 44% of my salary per year when I retire. With all that being said I net about $2400 biweekly or $5200 monthly.

As for some comps; apartment rentals in the area for a 700 sf 1br is $1900/mo and a 1100 sf 2br is $2500 with 1500-1700sf houses around $2500-$2700 to rent. I've played around with the NYT calculator and even dropping time in the home to 3-5 years it still shows advantageous to buy even at $500k. The PITI would be $2000-$2500 at the 400k-500k range. If I stretch my budget a bit more the options become much nicer very quickly. I assume this is due to the land being worth so much.

Would I be making a mistake to purchase a more expensive house that is an obvious improvement to an apartment to live in an area close to work in a 2-3 bed 2 bath? The only new construction homes are 2500 SF homes for $700k+ or $500k+ for a 2200sf townhome, but I can get a smaller reno'd ranch for 400-500k. I really don't know if I need to be saving more with my pension and stable job or if its is okay to have a larger house payment with zero debt and lock in the centralized area before I continue to get priced out as more companies and more folks from NY and CA move to the city that can outpace my salary growth.

personalfinance,"Seeking advice: payoff student loan, mother in law offering house, upcoming marriage","Hello,

Background 

My gf and I have been together for 5 years now. I am getting ready to propose to her in September. I already have the ring. 

We currently live in an apartment paying $2200 a month rent. However, in October our lease ends. My future mother in law owns a $900k house and wants to give it to us. She current rents it out to a family who pay the mortgage which is think is roughly $2500 a month. We haven’t really hashed out the details of the title, will a contract be written, banks involved, etc.

I paid for college myself and graduated with $80k in student load debt. I currently have $60k left to pay and my monthly due is $700 at a fixed interest rate of 2%. I think it was a 15 year loan.

My gf and I both have good paying jobs in tech. Roughly make $100k a year base with stocks and benefits on top of it. We eat out a lot and also go on a lot of trips so we aren’t frugal by any means.

Where I need advice

I don’t know what the next steps are. Cash out on stocks to payoff student loans vs continue paying student loans to build credit? If I didn’t have the monthly student loan burden, I could explore other types of passive income like putting more towards 401k. But I feel risk averse due to the student loan burden. I also have major life events coming up. Potentially getting a sweet deal on a house - I’m not even sure what to consider with my mother in laws proposal. Capital gains? I feel like writing a contract is the bare minimum. I’ve met with a handful of financial advisors but they’re all looking to meet long term whereas I feel I need some short term advice.

And so I have come to Reddit. Any guidance is appreciated.",finance,1645285406.0
CryptoCurrency,"US Fed closes loophole that allowed their employees trading stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies to prevent shady behaviour. This is a very good thing. This sub: ""stupid corrupt government!!""","I feel like all I do on here anymore is rant, but seriously? I am not from the US, so not an expert on all of this, but quick summary what happened:

Last October, it became public, that some Fed officials had [been trading stocks and bonds that could be influenced at least indirectly by their decisions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/after-years-of-being-squeaky-clean-the-federal-reserve-is-surrounded-by-controversy.html). And, weirdly enough, it seems this wasn't against any rules - and to be fair, this doesn't necessarily need to be shady in any way, but it's a really bad look. [Some people had to leave their positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html), even though nothing illegal happened, this was a pretty bad look.

Okay, so now they [approved rules banning their officials from doing that](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/fed-approves-rules-banning-its-officials-from-trading-stocks-bonds-and-also-cryptocurrencies.html). This is very reasonable. Should it have been done earlier? But, considering things happened already, is there anything better they could have done? I mean... not really? They reacted appropriately. There were no rules, this was bad, now there are rules. No reason to praise them for it, but they did the correct thing.

So what does this sub do? You can guess it, ""government bad"". Read the replies in [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swam4i/according_to_a_decision_by_federal_open_market/), or the ones in his even worse post titled [""Feds get caught insider trading, government says OOPSIE""](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swcozf/feds_get_caught_insider_trading_government_says/).

* ""In completely unrelated news the average net worth of thr spouses of these employees has gone up 500%"" (yes, of course this is prohibited now as well, as you would know if you would actually read any article)
* ""Fuck the government and the feds. They only do shit that benefits themselves.""
* ""They're all fucking crooks""
* ""Rules are beneath us. - Governments, prolly.""

People, what do you want? This is an example of a government body seing a bad situation and actually improving it. I am not a fan of the US government, but in this case, what tf do you want?

I understand that a company may have long-term contracts and be able to predict future revenue fairly well, but even if so I'm sure they can't accurately predict their expenses. All else aside, if a company if growing and having to raise funds there is no way they can predict interest rates for debt funding nor their future stock price for equity funding.

*  Contributions limited to &gt;$8,000/yr
* Interest credited at the end of the year on the beginning of the year amount. Therefore, you will not earn any interest the first year you begin making Voluntary Additional Contributions. 
* Withdrawal allowed at any time but discouraged, if I am not an employee I can take contrib+interest, if I am still an employee it is contrib only.

I'm curious what are people think, but this seems like a terrible idea:

1. The Federal Reserve holds assets to back the money supply. If the money supply were backed by Bitcoin, it might rapidly expand and contract, causing inflation, deflation, and boom and bust cycles every 6 MONTHS (see Bitcoin $65K --&gt; $30K --&gt; $69K --&gt; $30K)
2. If the Fed got involved in holding Bitcoin, it would have to get involved in securing the network (e.g., supplying hash power). Then the US Government would be involved in Bitcoin and it could start to take over the network (e.g., blocking addresses, reordering transactions, freezing accounts)
3. Lumis refers to Bitcoin as hard money - but isn't it anything but? It can be used to transfer value, but you never know what the value will be day to day. Thus having 'hard money' in the form of Bitcoin at the center of the US economy would be like building on a pile of sand, always trying to keep it from sliding out from under you
4. The last time 'hard money' was used to back the dollar was in the late 1800s at the gold standard actually held back the growth of the economy because there wasn't enough gold. With gold, there was the possibility of mining more, so money supply could expand, but with Bitcoin as the hard money, there would be a fixed limit - so the economy would have a fixed limit in size (and with a growing population, we would have decreasing GDP per person)
5. Bitcoin is said to be a deflationary currency, but from everything I can tell, living in countries with deflationary currencies is really bad - Japan has suffered from deflation for the last 30 years and its economy is basically stalled
6. If the Fed held Bitcoin, commercial banks (e.g., BofA, JPM) might think its a good idea too, but since they rely on their capital to backstop deposit from loan losses, holding Bitcoin might make all deposits in the entire US banking sector less safe. Literally it could create conditions for an overnight collapse of the banking sector like in the 1930s
7. DeFi could never compete if the US banking system got involved in holding digital assets - there would be too much money and too much programming talent being brought to bear on the sector. We wouldn't be talking about MakerDAO we would be talking about JPMDao

The only reason I can see for a country to 'hold' Bitcoin in its central bank is the following: if you are so far behind (e.g., economically poor) that putting all the chips in the middle of the table is your only chance to catch up. 

El Salvador is a case in point. Its economy is really based on one single export - coffee. Unfortunately, unlike oil or other commodities, coffee is relatively low value, relatively stable in value, and not particularly lucrative. The likelihood that El Salvador is going to move from a low income country to a middle or upper income country based on exporting coffee is close to zero.

What is El Salvador to do? There are really three options for countries trying to shift positions: 1) find a new high value commodity to export 2) exploit their people for labor and export that (i.e., the Chinese Communist Party's approach) and 3) develop a services economy with high skilled labor. Options (2) and (3) are hard - they require huge investments in education and decades of time to reap the benefits - the CCP had a 100 year plan (and is still following it), but democracies / other systems with less focus struggle to make long term (e.g., multi-generational) economic plans and investments. 

This leaves option (1). Since El Salvador can't discover major oil fields where they aren't and can't internally generate investment to build large plants to export geothermal energy (or other commodities it may have), it can't use its own commodities to change the picture. Its left with trying a risky strategy - buy a commodity and hope the price moons; there is only one commodity on Earth with the potential to moon: Bitcoin (because its value isn't determined by use, its determined by financial speculation). If prices go up, El Salvador could end up with a treasury that is flush with value / cash (e.g., Saudi Arabia). Then it would have a chance to invest those funds wisely, but likely struggle (e.g., Saudi Arabia).

The US is not El Salvador. We have a upper income, broadly diversified economy with high value exports and a high value services sector. We don't need to 'bet the farm' on speculative financial assets to stay ahead, nor to we need to be worried about others rising via bets like this (see Saudi Arabia struggling to create a diversified economy with all the money it has earned; literally they are buying temporary job creation from other countries...). The only foreign bets the US needs to pay attention to are the countries with long term, well designed plans to build healthy, diversified economies (e.g., the CCP and China).

A better place for the US to put some of the proposed assets is back into the US real economy (e.g., infrastructure and education).

personalfinance,Help! Bought a used car and think I got scammed?,"Hey guys so I recently got into a terrible car accident and had my car totaled. With that being said, I did get paid out but still owed 8k to Toyota so my insurance took care of that and sent me a decent amount of money to obviously go towards a new one. I was told to look for cars on Craigslist, Mom and pop shops or to do my research all around. I had bought a car before so I figured this time I would be smarter and make a better decision. With that being said, the car market right now is TERRIBLE and they are upcharging on just about anything. 

I found a really good deal on a 2018 Toyota Rav 4 XLE at 27k (Which is low in my area compared to other prices/ dealerships) with 20,349 miles on it. I was super stoked because that was a decent price and I know Toyota holds its value but I also know it’s a little over priced for a 4 year old vehicle. I had originally said no to the VSA insurance but of course with all of the recent technology on the vehicle and it being push to start, the finance guy did make sense saying I’d probably have to buy all these sensors and it would be more out of pocket than if I got this insurance. I fell for it and ended up getting a 5 year one for 3k which after doing my research and looking over my paper work I know was the stupidest mistake ever. I tried to haggle with them to bring it down a little lower but I wasn’t really too pushy since I just wanted the car and get out of there already. 

Now I’m ready to go back and cancel it with a verbal promise that I have “90 days”. No where in the contract states 90 days but does say 60 so I am hoping to be able to cancel that by tomorrow morning. I was charged a 5.3 % interest rate because my credit is horrible. I even put 4K as a down payment and my payments ended up being almost $500 a month. I know, absurd for it not being a new car. I feel totally lost and scammed because on the paper work it says subtotal was at around 35k. With my 4K down, it says amount financed is at 31k. Overlooking it all, I noticed it said total sale price ended up being 41k. Can someone overlook my paperwork and see what my options are now? I don’t understand why it says 41k an then says e (estimate). Did I end up getting the car for 31 or 41 and where did my 4K go towards? I was so eager to get approved for a car I totally realized I fucked up. The dude didn’t even offer me the option to buy the used vehicle contract agreement but did give me debt cancellation agreement. I am trying to see my best choice to do right now and my plan was to fix my credit up and end up refinancing in about 6-12 months. Am I totally fucked and was a complete dumbass to signing these papers or is there still some hope I can go back to the dealership and cancel that? Can someone overlook my paper work and see what the hell happened? I know I totally got ripped off and would’ve been better off getting a 2019 model at probably the same price. Any advice on what I should do? I wish I could upload the paper work but if anyone has any advice please let me know.

Currently I make 22/hr as an entry level contractor working about 15-20 hours a week while in school. Due to other expenses I try to save about 250-300 from each paycheck and put  it directly into my savings. New hires at my current company in my position make anywhere from 30-35/hr. 

I used my full-time hours over the summer to purchase a reliable car as I commute to school/work and still owe about 7k on the car while paying the minimum payment and 100-125 in extra principle per month, the car was originally financed at 9k (after down payment) at 3% interest which isn't too bad, I plan to put my tax refund into the payment and knock it down to around 6k whenever I get that. 

I as well have 21-23k in student loans (all federal) which have interest rates at around 3.25-3.75%. Aside from this I have no debt and a credit score of 700-710 depending on which site you use to check it. 

I'll be moving in with my girlfriend and she makes roughly 60-65k depending on bonuses per year with no debt aside from 5k on her car, both of us are hoping for ideally to split rent/utilities down the middle at 2000-2100 per month (so 1000-1050 per month each). We also have a lot of furniture/parents willing to help out a small amount with furniture/essentials for moving in. 

My current savings are 9.5k with the goal of reaching at least 11k by May's end but an expectation to reach 10k guaranteed provided there are no sudden financial issues that pop up.

Background: We are doing a new build that is due to be done in June.

The company seems good, I just don't like the idea of not having options.  Utility will be SMUD, who has 7.4c reimbursement rate for excess solar.  House is 3717 sq ft.  We are quite frugal w/ energy usage.  We would like to be able to nearly generate all energy with solar and have a battery system.  Eventually (w/i next 3 yrs), we will probably have a PHEV or EV vehicle.

Just had meeting w/ the installer.  They have two options arranged w/ the builder - a 4.68 KW system to meet California requirements or an ""optimized"" 6.24 KW.

6.24 KW system is a 16-panel (Canadian Solar 390W panels) w/ Enphase IQ7s for $28,080.  

4.68 KW system is a 12-panel (Canadian Solar 390W panels) w/ Enphase IQ7s for $21,060.  Estimated first year output 9360.

If I calculate that correctly, it's $4.50/W or $3.33/W after federal tax incentive for both options.

No option for further expansion of panels, no option for battery addition.

Lastly - I asked if the option for IQ8's was available and he would look into it.  Wondering if it is worth it for future proofing.

That seems high from what I've read here, but... apparently I don't have options.  Has anyone been in a new build captured homebuyer situation like this?  How did you navigate?

personalfinance,"I've accepted a new job, but I'm still waiting to hear I'm 100% hired.. How do I structure my resignation letter appropriately in the event I need to rescind it","Ladies and Gentlemen of Reddit,

I've been in discussion with a new employer for several months now. In the past few weeks, the company was officially given the green light to re-open their hiring process with potential candidates. The job I've accepted is still within the same ""sector' I'm currently employed in (Tech/DoD contracting). I'll be working on a project with a fairly large company (Fortune 1000), but will be employed by one of their subcontractors (a smaller company with 201-500 employees). The program/portfolio manager and their head of talent acquisition have both been amazing through the entire process. I've been reassured multiple times that I'm good to submit my notice with my current employer. They're anticipating me starting on March 7th, but are still waiting for the main contractor holder to finish their background checks/security investigations. My program manager said they're usually really quick and expects to have it back early next week (upcoming federal holiday). With that being said, I'm absolutely giving my current employer 2 weeks+ notice. I'm looking for tips on how to structure my letter of resignation that states I've accepted a job offer (still contingent) but as ""planning"" on resigning on X date. My career field requires a security clearance and we have a ""reinvestigation"" every 6 years (currently every 7 years with the backlogs). We start this process usually about 90-120 days out and is typically pretty painless. My only concern is that I've already had my reinvestigation process started by my current employer and the new contractor holder might have a policy to note hire folks who are within their window (more of a hassle for them to deal with). Would it be strange to structure my resignation notice with the preface that it's still contingent? I've worked here for nearly 4 years and am liked and respected by everyone I work with so I know there won't be any weird issues with me giving them that heads up. (We work in a career field with a high turnover rate, so the average person only stays usually about 2.5 years\~). By the time I get the 100% green light from my program manager I will be within the 2 week window. So I need to submit it before I hear back from them next week.

TLDR - What's the best way to submit a resignation letter with the preface that your new job is still contingent, that way if you do need to rescind, it's not as awkward.",finance,1645303866.0
personalfinance,Planning for after paying off student loans,"So  this week I will finally make the last payment on my private student  loan ( I still have some federal student loan debt). I paid off 60k in 5  years on a 10 year loan. I'm trying to plan out how to best adjust my  finances because my student loan payment is currently around 50% of my  monthly income. I am a single guy in my mid 20s and currently work as a  mechanical engineer.

Below is my current expenses per month:

income = 3578 with 5% 401k contribution

&amp;#x200B;

|Category|Amount (USD)|
|:-|:-|
|utilities (water, electric, sewer)|105|
|rent|848|
|groceries|280 (70 per week)|
|gas|160 (40 per week)|
|phone|100 (old phone died, got a new one)|
|Private loan|1750|
|dog medicine for cushings|65 (dog lives with parents)|
|renters insurance|10|

Anything leftover goes to increase the loan payment or some unexpected expense.

The  big thing is now I need to responsibly reallocate the $1750. For March  and April I plan on putting a large portion towards my savings account.  My savings is currently around 6k and I would like to get it up to the  8k-10k range to be better prepared. There's also a couple of minor  expenses I've been putting off like new running shoes, running  headphones, swimming stuff and just random odds and ends. I have a list  of stuff I want and have started ranking for priority. Anything leftover  would be a catch up contribution to my roth for 2022.

Starting in May my budget would be as below:

income = $3334 with 7% 401k and $140 per check to max HSA

&amp;#x200B;

|Category|Amount (USD)|
|:-|:-|
|utilities (water, electric, sewer)|115|
|rent|928 (rent goes up in May)|
|groceries|360 (90 per week)|
|gas|180 (45 per week)|
|phone|100 (old phone died, got a new one)|
|Private loan|1750|
|dog medicine for cushings|65 (dog lives with parents)|
|renters/car insurance|100|
|car savings|100|
|savings account|100|
|extra expenses|100|
|federal loan|585 (min payment 285, interest rate 3-5%, 20k left)|

About $170 leftover.

I wasn't planning on hammering the federal loan more than this until my savings account was up to a comfortable level. Federal loan has about 20k left on it. I could probably up the federal loan payment closer to the 700-800 range once I get a couple of other things settled and have it paid off by 2024. I don't have any debt besides that fed loan. I use credit cards but everything gets paid off monthly and only spent if there is money in my checking account for it.

Do you think the 7% for the 401k is too much and instead I should put 6% in 401k to put more towards the federal loan? I'm trying to avoid lifestyle creep but at the same time I want to spend more money on having fun.",finance,1645305127.0

economy,What's the ideal annual inflation rate?,"Hello guys. I'm currently coursing ""Economics and Businesses 101"" in Uni.

This week we talked about inflation and how bad it is for the economy an inflation rate higher than 5%, and how easy it is to rapidly increase from 5 to 10, 10 to 20, and so on. Also talked about Bolivia, Venezuela, Argentina, ""el corralito"", etc

But deflation is also very bad too! Although it may seem ideal if prices fall then you're not going to buy things (right?)

So, **what is the best inflation rate a country should have?**

My professor said that according to many people 2-4% is ideal, a 0% would mean the economy is just stuck. But why would that be the case? If the Federal Reserve stopped printing more money then inflation would not really exist when there's no supply crisis like there is nowadays, am I right?",finance,1645306221.0
personalfinance,Young professional asking for money advice for next 25 years.,"I guess I’m not super young anymore (in 30s now). I wanted to get some perspective and advice on this matter. 

As we all know, inflation is pretty high due to supply chain problems and all the money we printed. 

I listened to some smart financial folks, and they are saying that FED will not be able to raise interest rates drastically due to too much national debt and shocking the economic system. 

I did look up some our national debt to GDP. I think I agree with their assessment that US will probably maintain our interest rates relatively low. And let inflation runs relatively higher for a long time. 

So here’s my question. I’m in student debt (5%), house mortgage (3%) and business debt (4%). 

I’m attacking my student debt first. 
After that I’m not sure what should be my next moves. 

Pay off house or business (faster) ? Or should I try to build more assets (stocks or RE)? 

If the inflation is high, values of asset goes up higher and the debt monthly obligation is relative low due to rising cost of living. 

I bought my house in Jan. 2020 and its value went up already 28%. 
I feel like building asset is the right move (after paying off student loan) but I also see the argument of paying off your liabilities. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,HELP! URGENT! Did I get scammed for buying a used car?,"Hey guys so I recently got into a terrible car accident and had my car totaled. With that being said, I did get paid out but still owed 8k to Toyota so my insurance took care of that and sent me a decent amount of money to obviously go towards a new one. I was told to look for cars on Craigslist, Mom and pop shops or to do my research all around. I had bought a car before so I figured this time I would be smarter and make a better decision. With that being said, the car market right now is TERRIBLE and they are upcharging on just about anything. 

I found a really good deal on a 2018 Toyota Rav 4 XLE at 27k (Which is low in my area compared to other prices/ dealerships) I live in CA and got this one at Santa Monica with 20,349 miles on it. I was super stoked because that was a decent price compared to others and I know Toyota holds its value but I also know it’s a little over priced for a 4 year old vehicle. I had originally said no to the VSA insurance but of course with all of the recent technology on the vehicle and it being push to start, the finance guy did make sense saying I’d probably have to buy all these sensors and it would be more out of pocket than if I got this insurance. I fell for it and ended up getting a 5 year one for 3k which after doing my research and looking over my paper work I know was the stupidest mistake ever. I tried to haggle with them to bring it down a little lower but I wasn’t really too pushy since I just wanted the car and get out of there already. 

Now I’m ready to go back and cancel it with a verbal promise that I have “90 days”. No where in the contract states 90 days but does say 60 so I am hoping to be able to cancel that by tomorrow morning. I was charged a 5.3 % interest rate because my credit is horrible. I even put 4K as a down payment and my payments ended up being almost $500 a month. I know, absurd for it not being a new car. I feel totally lost and scammed because on the paper work it says subtotal was at around 35k. With my 4K down, it says amount financed is at 31k. Overlooking it all, I noticed it said total sale price ended up being 41k. Can someone overlook my paperwork and see what my options are now? I don’t understand why it says 41k an then says e (estimate). Did I end up getting the car for 31 or 41 and where did my 4K go towards? I was so eager to get approved for a car I totally realized I fucked up. The dude didn’t even offer me the option to buy the used vehicle contract agreement but did give me debt cancellation agreement. I am trying to see my best choice to do right now and my plan was to fix my credit up and end up refinancing in about 6-12 months. Am I totally fucked and was a complete dumbass to signing these papers or is there still some hope I can go back to the dealership and cancel that? Can someone overlook my paper work and see what the hell happened? I know I totally got ripped off and would’ve been better off getting a 2019 or newer model at probably the same price. Any advice on what I should do? I wish I could upload the paper work but if anyone has any advice please let me know.

personalfinance,Roth conversion question - is it worth it for us?,"My wife and I recently have moved our investments to a Fiduciary- they are recommending we convert $100K (first year) from an Individual 401K to a Roth IRA. My wife is 61 and I am 57, so she can do this without additional penalty.

I am questioning whether this is really worth it- and I am asking our investment advisor the same thing- but

&amp;#x200B;

1. They calculated our overall tax rate (fed) 14.3 but at a marginal 22%.
2. I just got a significant bonus this year - so our overall marginal rate is 25% (at 250K)
3. This conversion would be 100K - which would raise us to $350K for this year and the new marginal rate looks to be 29%.
4. So I am assuming this $100K conversion would need roughly $29K in taxes this year withheld.(plus another 5% for State taxes) - 
5. So then the remaining $66K forms the new basis to grow tax-free.
6. Assuming a 5% annual return for the next 20 years ( we would be paying out of more traditional 401Ks plus SS after my retirement) - before we pull this out. It would only grow to around $175K. 
7. If we left the 100K in pre-tax, the same 5% CAGR would grow to $265K
8. So that $265K would be taxed at a 35% marginal rate to realize the same net as the Roth.
9. There is no way we will be in the same high tax bracket during retirement as we are in right now.

The Fiduciary says ""rates are going up"" - yes- they very likely will - but in my view - we will be dropping in tax brackets- and it seems like an unlikely hedge against that across the board tax rate increases-

personalfinance,Marriage tax or something else?,"First time filing married filing jointly (MFJ) this year and out of curiosity, I compared the numbers against filling as singles (not married but filing separate). We noticed our net federal refund is significantly less (almost 3000 dollars) as a married couple compared to pre-marriage. We always thought marriage tax would only kick in for high earners (622k+?) or those with large mortgages, so we were quite surprised to see such a big difference, especially after the ""TCJA"".

Breakdown of the numbers

||Spouse 1|Spouse 2|Joint|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AGI|117000|113000|230000|
|Deductions|26000 (itemized)|12500 (Standard)|26000 (itemized)|

|Federal tax withheld|19000|16400|35400|
|Refund|3000|\-1600|\-1600|

Looking at the numbers, we think the issue is that we lost an entire standard deduction as a result of the SALT cap, and that led to a 3000 increase in federal tax liability.

Is this to be expected, and if we are missing anything? I feel that our situation is pretty standard, dual-income with W2s, a mortgage, and no side business. Most of our families and friends told us that marriage would be a tax reduction and obviously, we are not seeing that. 

On a related note, what are some of the financial benefits of marriage if both spouses earn similar incomes? Currently, it does not seem like there are many scenarios in which MFJ would come out ahead in our situation.

CryptoCurrency,Why Stablecoin Regulation or Banning Doesn’t Matter...,"[TL;DR](https://youtu.be/WtawhCQG-v8)   
It is important to have a complete picture of stablecoins and their continued innovation to understand why regulation will have no effect and not change what is inevitably going to happen, a complete replacement of centralized fiat currency.

We’ll cover the uses of stablecoins, legacy banking (business model and asset erosion), how stablecoins work, the advantages and disadvantages of the different stablecoin solutions, how money is made with stablecoins, why they are the target of regulation and what does an unstoppable, regulation-proof stablecoin look like.

**How are Stablecoins Used?**

Cross-border payments occur in smaller, closed financial networks requiring middlemen to facilitate these transactions. These middlemen have made cross-border payments expensive, slow and restrictive. McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that the financial system generates $2T annually from these payments. Ridiculous.

Cross-border payments are made fast, easy and considerably less expensive than legacy banking systems by using stablecoins.

With stablecoins, you can “stay in crypto” without having to go into a fiat currency to store value. This saves time, cost and keeps you in full control of your money because you are no longer in the banking system, while maintaining price stability.

Leverage: Crypto-collateralized stablecoins can be used to increase your position in a particular cryptocurrency. If you own ETH, you can “mint” a stablecoin by pledging ETH as collateral to mint a stablecoin. With that stablecoin, you can now buy more ETH to mint more stablecoin and so on. This is a technique to leverage your crypto position.

This yield farming concept became popular in the summer of 2020 when crypto traders and stakers were accelerating their returns in staking pools by leveraging up their position (to then stake in proof of stake and liquidity pools).

**Legacy Banking:** **Middlemen And The Money Printer**

The entire legacy banking system is built on fees and interest on money they don’t own. Many think that banks accept deposits to lend it back to you at a higher rate. There is more going on here. Banks take your deposits and use that as their reserve requirement so that they can borrow many times that amount from the federal reserve bank. Then, that capital is used for lending to yield much higher returns (because they leveraged up their lending capacity). It is ALL inflation. Meanwhile, you get sub 1% on your deposits.

30-40% of all the U.S. dollars in existence today were printed out of thin air in a 12-month period. If the USD was a cryptocurrency, it might be one of the worse ones. With this and the talk of stablecoin regulation, stablecoins backed by the USD may not be so “stable” in the future.

With the “bail in” laws passed by the Obama administration, depositors can have their capital seized if their bank fails. This law puts depositors first in line to cover any insolvencies a failed bank will have.

It is unfair and dishonest that you may have to pay for a banker’s risk taking and not get the benefit from the endless inflation of fiat currency that is printed out of thin air.

Yields in cryptocurrency are quickly eroding at the asset base (reserves they can use to borrow from the fed) of traditional banks. Consumers are moving to much higher yielding cryptocurrency staking to earn transaction fees in liquidity pools and rewards/interest for staking to validate blockchain transactions (Ex. Proof Of Stake Blockchain Consensus).

**Types Of Stablecoins And How They Work**

Understanding stablecoin innovation as the race to decentralization continues:

**1. Centralized and Physically Asset-Backed.**

Stablecoins like Tether and Paxos Gold physically back their cryptocurrency with USD and physical gold, respectively. You buy these on the open market or supply the physical collateral/USD for these protocols to “mint” new stablecoin. This is a great way to store value. However, centralized systems require faith that 1 Tether actually returns 1 USD when you redeem. Tether has come under scrutiny with claims that there is not actually a 1:1 Tether/USD ratio. Furthermore, systems like this are easily shut down by banks or regulators. Physical asset-backed stablecoins provide an attractive alternative to invest in the cryptocurrency market, while giving you exposure to another asset like gold.

**2. Crypto-Collateralized.**

The stablecoin market, then, evolved to take a step to further decentralization. Stablecoins like MakeDAO use ETH-based cryptocurrencies as collateral to mint their stablecoin. With systems like this, you are not relying on a centralized authority or entity to “back” the stablecoin. It is only you pledging collateral to a smart contract which is public proof that it exists as collateral on the blockchain. This gives you certainty that the system truly has underlying value that can’t be taken away or falsified (like the Tether accusations). However, in times of market volatility, your collateral can be liquidated if the “loan to value” ratio breaks a threshold.

**3. Algorithmic**

Purely algorithmic stablecoins rely on market forces and smart contract software rules to maintain the price of the dollar or whatever asset they are tracking. Terra Luna is a 2-token system (utility token and stablecoin) that allows you to burn one of the tokens to mint the other in times of stablecoin price instability. For example, if the price of TerraUSD is above the dollar, you can burn the utility token for TerraUSD at the exchange rate at the price it should be. Then, you can sell for a profit helping to bring the price back down of 1 TerraUSD equal to 1 USD. Incentivizing the market keeps the stablecoin at the price it should be.

CryptoCurrency,"Technical Analysis - February 20, 2022","Now that **BTC** has broken below the Triangle which [I commented about a few hours ago in the Daily Discussion](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/swnk8f/daily_discussion_february_20_2022_gmt0/hxnry1i/?context=3), where do we go from here?

[1h Chart: Bear Flag continuation breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3he7x8fi1yi81.png?width=1375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2bb952fe290a20355ea6134eae929a15edd9057)

First, let's take a look at this recent bounce in context of the macro picture.

[Daily Chart: Inverse Head and Shoulders failing](https://preview.redd.it/v11z3fgr1yi81.png?width=1364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05ff0f86b3d4a1acfb42813175fcdbf6805764da)

BTC bottomed on Jan 24 (along with the SPY/QQQ) and got over the downtrend line with force. Many were calling for an **inverse head and shoulders** pattern back to the $50k area. However, the pattern failed to trigger over the neckline (no follow-through). We have now lost the right shoulder below $42k.

It's possible that the right shoulder could rebuild itself should near-term support hold (blue arrow). However, patterns which fail initially tend to require additional confirmation to be trusted again. Therefore, I would not be bullish until the neckline is taken out at $46-$47k.

This is where I see price action in the the short term. **$36.5k** is fast approaching and should see some sort of reaction. Should we consolidate without any bottoming action (climactic sell-off or W-bottom), then the next leg down takes us to the logical area of support at the **$33k** lows.

[4h Chart: Short term support areas](https://preview.redd.it/g7qagx0l1yi81.png?width=1372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d048827b4f8b69704b0e45520737bdc9fcb9755)

Of course, this all depends on what other asset classes are doing--mainly U.S. stocks (which open on Tuesday). We are currently in a deleveraging/risk-off environment. The market is looking for any reason to sell during these uncertain times (interest rates, Ukraine, etc.). And yes, that includes cryptocurrency which is traded the same way as equities, commodities, etc.

There isn't much support below $29k until the $20k area. I know that sounds like a long way from here, but it would be a 70% decline from the all-time highs. **This is not unheard of in crypto**. The SPY is headed to the 400 area *if we break* the January 24 lows. Market sentiment is driving prices lower at the moment. Charts merely reflect what buyers and sellers are doing.

[Weekly Chart: Medium term support areas](https://preview.redd.it/2wdlgbql1yi81.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2e56bcd97286283771db6dfd043f99cf3dc43f4)

This post is not meant to spread FUD or cause panic--just relaying my interpretation of the charts. For what it's worth, I reduced my main holdings (ADA and ETH) back when they lost the daily 8/20 SMA.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Makes You Mentally Strong,"We crashed pretty hard last night and *honestly*?

I don’t really care that much anymore.

We’ve seen some pretty huge crashes over the last few months and crypto always climbs back up (unless something else happens and keeps it low).

I guess the point I’m trying to make is, is that appetite for crypto is healthy and increasing despite downward market pressures and it’s always something external that causes the crash, illustrating that there isn’t anything intrinsically unsound in this investment product.

My Recommendation?

Treat the OpenSeas hack as an opportunity to get a 5-10% discount on all your favourite coins because in a couple of days we’ll be back at 40k.

What About The Fed Rate Hikes?

Valid question! Crypto will probably crash pretty hard in the few days around the announcement, only to regain momentum afterwards. That’s another solid buying opportunity if you don’t have the funds right now.

Either way, investing in crypto really makes you super resilient WHICH IS A GOOD THING.",cryptocurrency,1645358420.0

CryptoCurrency,Could a nation attack a blockchain?,"Bear with me on this. 

With all the tensions between Russia and USA/Europe at the moment I started wondering. Russia and Ukraine seem to push Crypto adoption ([Source Russia](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/russia-recognizing-crypto-as-a-form-of-currency-validates-wells-fargos-hyper-adoption-outlook-202202091425), [Source Ukraine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/new-law-makes-ukraine-the-future-of-bitcoin)). USA has been increasing BTC mining in states such as Texas ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/17/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-mining-texas)).

In my opinion, nations have to chose between one of two strategies when it comes to crypto. First, one could hop on the bandwagon and embrace this new technology. Put bitcoin in your federal reserves, create a strong legal framework for companies to operate in the crypto space, focus research on crypto, subsidize companies, ..

Second, and this is where I come back to the title of this post, a nation could try and destroy cryptocurrencies as we know it. To maximize impact on your adversaries, you could wait until they have stocked up their federal reserves with currencies like Bitcoin.

Let's make this more concrete, you are the USA, you record all bitcoin mining network traffic. We know what a commonly used ports. Nodes have a built in discovery method to find other nodes ([source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3536/how-do-bitcoin-clients-find-each-other)). So you create a list of used ports, IPs, corporations, .. In the meantime the USA builds up a small army of mining pools. Maybe even participating in mining over several months to build up a stash of bitcoin and hashing power.

Now, the attack, the USA instructs it's ISPs to block the known miners from reaching each other and other countries. They dump all their own Bitcoin on major exchanges to cause panic and decrease the price. They publish FUD in the news (obviously). But most of all, they attempt [a 51% attack](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%2051%25%20Attack,hash%20rate%20or%20computing%20power). This might be extremely expensive to setup but you only have to run this for a few hours to completely destroy credibility and the value of BTC your adversaries are holding.

USA could collaborate with it's typical allies such as Australia, UK, ..

Do you believe it is feasible? I am mainly focusing on BTC since this is the currency nations will most likely put in their reserves.

If so, do you believe one of the big nations would attempt it?

personalfinance,40 yo in Midwest Needs Feedback,"Hi All,

Long time lurker, first time poster to this thread :-) I am a 40 yo male that needs financial direction. 

Background: I was raised in a lower middle class household in Kentucky  ($30K-50K per year fluctuated father was a coal miner) growing up and did not really understand how to use and save money. I was lucky enough to get a full scholarship for undergrad so my BA degree was paid for. I took out federal student loans for grad school and became a psychologist and just had my student loans forgiven under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (it was a LONG 10 years). After having all that debt gone, I was able to buy a house last month and put 20% down so I wouldn't have to pay PMI.

Here are my financial details. I'm curious what feedback you have (put more into retirement, pay off credit cards, etc). What should be my top priority (pay off mortgage as fast as possible, etc)? Appreciate your help.

Mortgage $247,920 at 3.375% (total monthly payment is $1431 including mortgage, taxes, and insurance. 30 year fixed mortgage).

Credit Card Debt is $26,000 at 0% interest until August 2023.

I have $26,000 in an emergency fund. I realize I could pay off all my cc debt but that would leave me with 0 emergency fund.

Car is paid off.

No other debt.

I try to keep my monthly expenses (excluding mortgage payment) at around $2000 per month including food, utilities, business expenses, etc.

Income: $96,000 per year at my full time job (university) and approximately $30,000-40,000 per year from my side hustle (private practice, I see people for therapy weekly).

Retirement: I have $150,000 in my 403b and my university contributes an amount equal to 10% of my income (so they contribute 9600/year into my 403b. I have never contributed anything from my 96,000 salary but could if I needed to.

Should I just make sure I pay off my credit cards by the expiration of the 0% interest and not contribute anything extra to my retirement and put all of my extra money toward my mortgage? If I did that, I could have it paid off in 5-7 years then max out my retirement accounts after. Having that much debt (247K) scares me. My student loans were around $250,000 and that was a stressful 10 years until I completed the program and they were forgiven. So peace of mind and pay it off ASAP or max out retirement accounts now and pay off mortgage in 15-20 years since it's a low interest rate?

But what is its exchange rate in 2019 dollars? Well, \*officially\* The inflation rates are as follows:  
2019: 1.81%

2020: 1.2%

2021: 7%

So in 2019 dollars, the price of bitcoin is 34302.

Averaging the deltas together, we get an average price increase of 2.62x or 262%. This is 87% inflation. Now, where would bitcoin be at if priced in these terms? $14,500. 

So, right now we are already in a hyper bear market if the economy was sane. Its not. The majority of the inflation also didn't hit until the tail end of 2021.

personalfinance,2020 tax return issue causing issues in 2021,"We recently became aware of an issue with our 2020 tax return that is now causing problems for 2021. To summarize, my wife and I file jointly and in 2020 she worked the entire year, however partway through the year her employer moved her from their company payroll to one of those payroll services for household employees (W2, not 1099). Our withholding was almost perfect, and we ended up owing a very small amount of money for federal (two digits). 

Using TurboTax, we went to e-file and the return was rejected, saying that the FEIN for the new payroll system was not known. According to TT, this was somewhat common and not a big deal, because new entities sometimes aren’t in the IRS system yet. This would make sense, as the switch happened in October of 2020. TT instructed that we would be unable to e-file, and should file by mail. I had never done that before, but I printed the documents from TurboTax and wrote a check for the payment. We mailed the return and check as instructed, and the check cleared a couple weeks later. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I received a letter from the IRS saying we had a credit on our account in the amount of the small payment from our 2020 filing, but no return to apply it to. The letter instructed us to mail our return again if we already filed (which we did). I am going to do that, but now I am unable to e-file for 2021 because the AGI number used for verification does not match what the IRS has on record (because the IRS apparently has nothing on record). 

Due to life changes, my 2021 refund will be thousands of dollars (drastically different income, missed stimulus, added child tax credit, etc.) and I don’t particularly want to wait years for that refund. What would be the fastest way to get this resolved? Obviously I need to respond to the IRS letter and send my 2020 return again, but do I wait and hope I can e-file before the deadline? Sounds like paper returns are extremely backed up. I’ve never had any issues before, so just looking for the correct next steps to avoid further issues. I appreciate any recommendations.

cybersecurity,How Should A Privacy-Oriented Business Deal With a Client That Has Stolen Another Person's Bank Account,"How should a privacy-oriented business deal with a client that has Stolen another person's bank account in such a way that minimizes the personally identifiable information we must know about them and that would be accepted in a US Court of Law.

One of the toughest issues a Privacy-oriented fintech company must deal with is dealing with a customer that might be attempting to link a bank account that they compromised and stole from another person.

Clearly, one of the easiest ways to mitigate this is to force the customer to submit federal-government approved identification. Now, the problem with that is the user has to surrender highly sensitive documents and entrust that the company will actually do a very good job protecting that information--not all companies will.  Yet, every time we users deal with a fintech company, we are forced to submit our personal information--and trust our data will not be stolen from their servers.

A cryptographic alternative will not seem to work--since the jury probably will not understand the nature of the cryptographic process and can easily be tricked by the opposition--especially when using the non-repudiation argument.

Would anyone here that has legal experience dealing with such court cases be able to recommend a method for dealing with a user that is commiting bank fraud that is a more privacy-friendly technique than simply forcing clients to submit sensitive personal identity documentation--which might get compromised from the online service?",technology,1645372012.0

gaming,"As someone who does not pre-order videogames because of anti-consumer trends, From Software has earned my pre-order, and here is why you should consider doing so, as well.","TL;DR will be below post, and of course, no spoilers.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past few years, the gamers of the world have been subjected to very anti-consumer trends, loot-boxes, microtransactions, and to a less egregious  extent pre-order's and the ""pre-order bonus"" 

We have seen a steady decline in the products that large companies put out, so much so that when you finally get your hands on that fresh new videogame you've over-hyped yourself for, through the help of incredibly powerful marketing, you find that the game doesn't come with that cool feature that sold you on the product, or in some recent and glaring examples, games that do not function in an even playable level. This trend has led me to the ideal that it's up to me, as the individual consumer, to send a message with my hard earned money, that ""No, you won't see a dime from me until I'm convinced this product is real, in my hands, and has been vetted by independent reviews, we can trust. "" (Another anti-consumer topic for another time) 

The team at From Software has exceeded all expectations leading up to the release of their brave new title Elden Ring. Most companies have very curated experiences in their trailers, and rightfully so, you want your game platformed and shown to the public in a way that clearly defines the experience, builds hype through expectation and outlines those expectations to the consumer. It's only natural that you want to convey this through action-packed scenes, pivotal story moments early in the game, and features that outline what makes this experience unique, and what can be expected. However, many of these examples are within a vacuum and in some egregious cases, even CGI rendered and sold to you as the actual experience, all in an attempt to over-hype the consumer to perpetuate a culture of pre-ordering games for these companies to cash in as much money as they can day 1, which in turn bolsters the regard and public notice for the game, which in turn creates more pre-orders, and this dirty cycle continues, until we as the bottom-line are left with a half finished, barely working, if at all, product that was no where near what we expected when we initially purchased the game.    

To back this up, there are also trends amongst the largest of companies, to portray a sort of false narrative through allowing a few people to play a cut of the game publicly. However we've also seen that these can be curated into making us believe things about their game, that simply aren't true, all the while these figures, usually people that work for the company, even developmental within the company it self, are payed off, and locked behind a non-disclosure agreement, and are essentially fed what to say, believe, review, criticize, ect. All of this in an attempt to create this cycle we've seen time and time again.

From Software, and their new title Elden Ring, have done right by the consumer, and are what I hope is a trend towards and a more fair, and honest marketing lead up before release, and as such have earned my pre-order, the first one I've purchased in a few years, and here is why. 

First of all, the topic of delays. I believe we were roughly 65 days from release when the public was notified that there would be a delay. This delay was not 6 months, or a year, or even 4 years, it was an additional month, to help tighten numbers, populate the world, and finish up some final details, all of which would provide a better experience for consumers. This wasn't a message to us that there are things that need to be worked out like major game-play elements or entire sections of the game that still haven't even began development. 

The review process, was publicly shared and orchestrated through the most respected of the Soul's Community, and I heard individual reviews that differed greatly from one another, instead of a copy-paste read away from a bullet point they received from a company. It is rare to hear the negatives of a review a month or two out from release, you can tell there are some back-door deals when everything the individual reviewer says makes the game out to be this over-whelming, completely unique experience, absolutely unlike anything you've ever seen before, and it is parroted by every other reviewer that took place in this early process, if we even get those reviews in the first place. Many companies keep that locked and keyed away, which is an even bigger sign, things are not trending the right way for the consumer. Furthermore, From Software was kind enough to let thousands play the game early, and share that footage with the community, so we could all see exactly what was in store for us. A great example is the Red Bull Levels event that was held just yesterday. Some of the best players, no hit runners, PvP'ers, struggled greatly in the event, against some insane bosses, and even regular ""trash mobs"" and honestly, it was a joy to watch because I felt as though this was a genuine experience based off of their shock, reactions, a honest disappointment. 

Lastly, upon the topic of pre-ordering the game itself. From Software is taking the ""No gameplay enhancements "" approach. You get cool things with a pre-order of Elden Ring, which are an Adventurers Guide, a sort of strategy guide lite, and a bonus gesture, neither if which are gameplay changing. Even with the Elden Ring: Deluxe Edition you get the OST and a digital artbook of the game world itself. Which I might add, are typically quite worth the extra $10 you could throw at From Software. But most importantly, even if you don't care for the soundtrack and some pictures that might give you a small piece of lore not quite fleshed out or found in the game, you're not punished for not buying the more expensive option when purchasing or pre-ordering your game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the major players in the gaming industry can learn from these practices, I'm looking at you Ubisoft, EA, CDPR, Activision, ect. ect. ect. I believe it is important to reiterate the point, that you, as the individual, have all the power in the world to stop these anti-consumer practices with your spending, and more importantly, how you spend. Just like we can choose not to partake in shady pre-orders, we can also choose to support the companies that have done everything in their power to convey exactly what the consumer is receiving with their purchase, and doing so in an honest, fair way. As such, for the first time in many years, I'm pre-ordering a game. Not just because I'm excited for the experience, but I'm satisfied with From Software's degree at which they ensure that I'm not being treated like a whale or a cash cow, but instead are providing a solid foundation for expectations, and respecting that there should be a relationship between developers and consumers, and that relationship should be open, and honest with both parties. 

Thank you From Software, for being a beacon of light in a sometimes shameful industry, and raising the baseline of what we should expect from the companies developing titles we throw millions, if not billions, of dollars at. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR From Software has gone above and beyond in their marketing cycle before release of Elden Ring, and are raising the standard that has dropped so very low in our industry that we love so much. They show consumers respect, and honor the values that should be upheld by all companies we have turned into media giants. As someone who as a rule no longer pre-orders video games, I'm choosing to pre-order Elden Ring to send a message that there is a higher standard that can be achieved if these massive companies stop treating consumers as nothing but a source of revenue.",technology,1645373939.0

devops,Trying to decide when to dive into devops/sre. Am I ready?,"Hello Folks! I've been bouncing around touching various IT/CS stuff for the last few years, not entirely sure what I was looking for. A month ago I read the stickied post from the hiring manager here and realized that this is probably the exact niche I'm interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to decide if I'm ""ready"" to pull the trigger and start applying for devops/sre jobs, or if I should collect a few more months/years of experience. Fed government type job right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have three options. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm on an R&amp;D dev team that does a sort of grab bag of projects. It's mostly security focused. They recently put me ""in charge"" of an SDN project, for which I'm just kind of throwing together a virtual environment, automating the build for everyone's local environments, and documenting the thing. (And every once in a while I help out on a project doing android stuff.)

I can stay here for the next yearish. I like the team and the project a lot, and I've been learning a ton. Only downsides is that it is very theoretical and no production, so we basically don't use CI/CD and nobody other than me is super interested in scaling, since we'd probably just hand it off to someone else if it got to that point. 

I can request to get on a team that does more ""devops"" stuff, which supposedly exists here, but I need to find out if they are real, if they are not toxic, and if they do stuff that will be actually useful when I inevitably job hop. I highly doubt that all three of those are yes answers from what I've seen here.

I could also try to start applying for jobs in greener pastures right now- only problem is that I have a service obligation with these guys for either another year and a half cuz they paid for some of college, or convince a new employer to buy me out. It's about $50k to buy me out, so I'm skeptical that anyone would actually do that, at least not without even worse strings attached.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

2ish years of general IT with a focus on L2 networks in high security environments. Lots of powershell.

5ish months of ""dev-like"" work. 3 doing powershell stuff for my university, last 2 months here doing bash and python with a bit of small scale linux admin. 

Bachelors in IT. Casp Plus. Security Clearance. Ambivalent about using it, even though it's a juicier one.

Random related skills I've picked up that I feel mildly good about: SQL, Cisco voice, Java, ESXI, People Skills.

CryptoMarkets,Is this the end of crypto as we know it?,"Is it say goodbye to the DEX?

Regulation in the US is forthcoming. 
Rumor is, Biden is signing an EO this week to initiate a think-tank, working-group, to study crypto and determine how crypto shall be regulated.
In my opinion this is very good for our industry; that is if, on the table, mainstream adoption, is what we seek. What will this regulation look like however?

I think this regulation will come in many forms, as there are many moving components to this industry. I don’t think we want broad strokes here. 
But what will be the end-game here for the regulators? What is of paramount importance for the government? … tax money. 

I believe above innovation and certainly above the power decentralization provides the people, is the government’s ability to generate their “yield farm”, in the form of taxing this industry. 
So what then, if capturing tax revenue is of paramount importance, would be at greatest risk (within our industry)?
I would contend it would be anything and everything that could potentially circumvent the collection of tax revenue. 

So what creates that potential?? 
Privacy coins? Cold wallets? Decentralized exchanges?? 
What has the power to elude the government?? 
That’s what they will be coming after. 
In a government regulated crypto world, will CBDC’s be programmed to only permit on/off ramping within Centralized Exchanges that are registered and licensed with the Fed? 
Is cold storage banned? Privacy coins outlawed???
Of course this scenario would create an underworld for crypto but is that what we want???

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto is bullish, we just don't know whether that's in the short-term or the long-term","In the next few months, we're going to see a couple decisions from the US government:

1. Are we ever *really* raising rates?
2. What's the taxation and reporting situation around crypto going to look like?

First, consider (1). There's two ways this plays out:

The first possibility is that the Fed never really raises rates, continuing with or even increasing the current inflation rate. This would make the value of equities go up pretty much in perpetuity (or at least until enough people's savings get washed out that they lose faith in USD altogether). What this means for cryptocurrencies is unclear as of yet; the usual assumption is that crypto is correlated with stocks, but we don't know if that's truly the case. It's possible that cryptocurrencies encounter a bear market even despite continued inflation, but the market should generally see crypto as more promising than the traditional tech sector, i.e., the likes of Apple and Meta, at this point.

Alternatively, the Fed could genuinely go through with raising interest rates in order to preserve the long-term value of the dollar. In that case, I'd say crypto is all but doomed in the short-term, but still promising in the long-run; some people hope that crypto might rally even admist rising interest rates, but the market is pretty small and US-centralized at this point (due to how India and China have reacted to it), so I unfortunately don't see it happening. However, they can't afford to do this for long, because that's also a pretty bearish story for equities, and it wouldn't take much in the way of corporate layoffs for the Fed to have to go back into stimulus-check mode. The real question is how long the Fed would be able to raise interest rates before inflation necessarily has to come back on the menu (no doubt, they'll try their best), which really depends on how hard they want to try; my guess is that they'll go back to inflation as soon as public opinion changes, which won't take much, especially with all this Russia/Ukraine business and the resulting effects on the energy sector. 

Now for (2):

Unfortunately, there are a few reasons to be bearish on crypto-friendly tax reforms, primarily being that India and China are both crypto non-grata at this point. With that said, there's quite a bit of pro-crypto lobbying and marketing going on that we have yet to see the effects of, so hopefully all the pro-crypto political candidates you see on YouTube actually get somewhere.

Conclusion:

Regardless of how either of these points play out, crypto is still very worthwhile to hold in the long-run. In fact, I'm more excited for a dump than for a pump right now because I spent my Fiat too soon buying the last dip; hopefully, I'll be able to double up my bags for cheap in the coming weeks and months. If it goes up after that, awesome! If not, I'll just double up my doubled-up bags.

TL;DR: Nobody knows shit about fuck; if you're gonna invest, invest into coins you're fine with holding even if they drop another 90%. Good luck, fellow degenerates!",cryptocurrency,1645383212.0

personalfinance,Refinance or Prioritize Student Loans?,"I have $300K in student loans. The interest is zero percent now, will go up to an effective rate of around 5% probably in may, and up to an effective rate of 7.5% a year from now. I could probably refinance at 4-5%, though interest rates are going up and I'm switching jobs soon.

These are direct from my government, so if I lose my job or my salary decreases, I can reduce the payment amount. Worst case my life falls apart but I never have to worry about making payments  beyond my means. I know how quickly life can change and that one bad decision or unlucky moment can cost a career, in which case the government protections would be very useful.

After taxes, if current plans work out (expected, call it 75% chance of success) I'll be making enough to put around 120K/yr toward retirement or student loans within the next year or two. I'm starting a new role which lets me do that. There's still maybe a 25% chance it doesn't work out and maybe I wind up unemployed for a month looking for a new role that is likely to pay less. (If the new role is a bad fit I will leave, and if I don't get promoted within about three years I'll be laid off.) I can get another job but it likely won't pay quite as well.

So (1) Should I refinance student loans with private ones that lack the income-based protections?

(2) If so, should I wait six months, three years, or not at all?

(3) If I don't refinance, should I use the majority of that $120K/yr to pay down student loans ASAP or invest 100% equities? The market has nominal 10% historical returns which are only a little bigger than the student loans once the student loans are at 7.5%, but this is unusual debt: you never have to pay it off if your income can't support it. If you ever lost your career or were forced somehow into early retirement or if the market for your career went away, it's a lot better to have $500K in equities and $300k in income-based debt than it is to have $200K in equities.

(4) If I do refinance, should I use the majority of that $120K/yr to pay down student loans ASAP or 100% equities? The market has nominal 10% historical returns which are a bit bigger than student loans at 4-5%.

personalfinance,"We're thinking of selling our second car to cash in on the used car market, is there anything we're not thinking of?","My husband and I bought a brand new 2019 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring in mid-2019. Due to the pandemic our jobs have both moved remote and won't be returning to the office again for the foreseeable future. As a result, for the last 2.5 years we've put almost no miles on that vehicle and very rarely need two cars at the same time. So we're thinking about selling the car and getting rid of the loan and car payment, and pocketing the cash. 

We owe $19,000 on it still, at 2.89% interest rate. Our monthly payments are mid-$600s. Our other vehicle is a 2015 Kia Soul (!) that is completely paid off, and recently had a warranty engine rebuild so it's basically a new engine (so we don't think it will be having issues any time soon).  We also live near family and other transportation options (lyft, bus, etc.) so on the rare occasion we need more than one vehicle we can borrow or rent/rideshare one.

I submitted the info to a couple of sites that give instant offers, and it's looking like we could sell the car for around $29k which is only a couple grand less than we paid for the car originally. 

It seems like a no-brainer: we don't need the car, we could always use the cash, and getting rid of our only car payment and the insurance would free up \~$700 a month in our budget. Is there anything we aren't considering? 

To be clear, besides our mortgage and a small subsidized student loan, this is our only debt. We live well within our means, so we don't necessarily NEED the money, the cash would go into savings or be invested.

UPDATE: A few people have mentioned keeping the Honda and selling the Soul, on a good day our soul is worth about half as much as what we owe on the Honda. So we’d be selling a car and still have a car payment and no cash in hand do do anything useful with. Plus registration and upkeep on Honda is much higher. If we do this it would definitely be the Honda that goes.



UPDATE: we sold our Honda for a final price of $31,000 even. Our payoff for the remaining loan was just shy of $18,350, so we’ll be pocketing almost $13k as well as freeing up $700 a month in our budget.

However, we will be paying off some debt shortly before applying for a mortgage, and we are worried about it causing a significant dip in our scores so close to buying a house.

The first loan to pay off is my spouse's car loan, which is scheduled to be paid off in June. The account has been open for 5 years and the principal balance was $10k, not sure if that matters.

Additionally, I have 3 federal student loans from graduate school which have been in the pandemic forbearance since graduation and I've never paid on. We've been saving up and have enough to knock them all out in a lump sum, and we've intended to do that just before the forbearance ends (which is currently scheduled for May 1st). These loans have been open for 2-4 years and have a principal balance of ~$65k.

Our only other debts are two small student loans and my very manageable car loan. We also have one shared credit card which we use for the rewards, and pay off completely every month.

And worse, we’re at the beginning of it. Which means, this thing has a whole lot more to drop before it levels out. Where the bottom is, know one really knows. What we do know is that we have a bunch more fud coming our way, in the near future. 

Some of those are: 

1. Russia creeping into a war 

2.  Interest rates being announced in a few weeks 

3. Possible crypto regulations this year 

4. Inflation and this drying up people’s ability to buy more crypto 

5. And the wild card - this being a political year/midterms so a lot more uncertainty as to what could happen 


Take those factors and also add in that crypto winters have traditionally lasted a few years, and you can see why everyone’s freaking out. But like ol’ Warren likes to say, “be greedy when others are fearful, and be fearful when others are greedy”. 

And the world is pretty fearful right now.",cryptocurrency,1645401663.0

CryptoCurrency,What actually is the best way of staking and contributing to SOLANA Ecosystem? And how much can I benefit?,"That's my first post. I read the RULES carefully and want to comply to everything. Please let me know if I missed something.

I tried to figure out the questions in the topic title, here is what I found:

**So why Solana? And why Staking it?**

*Solana is a high-performance, non-sharded layer 1 blockchain. It uses proof of history (PoH), a PoH-optimized version of* [*Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)*](https://www.blockchain-insider.de/was-ist-practical-byzantine-fault-tolerance-pbft-a-954086/) *in combination with proof-of-stake (PoS) technology.* 

In my personal opinion, which is shared by an ever growing [community of developers](https://solana.com/developers), Solana is technologically much more advanced than Ethereum (even the not yet available ETH 2.0 update) and Bitcoin. It is c*heaper, faster and more environmental friendly* (saving 99,99% of the energy ETH consumes per transaction).

**What is Solana staking and how does it generate passive income?**

[Solana staking](https://docs.solana.com/de/staking) means that you, the owner of $SOL coins, can ‘delegate’ your coins to a validator to earn rewards and ensure the network’s security. Sounds risky? Sounds complex? It's not.

The validator will use the delegated coins to ensure the network’s health and to validate transactions. For this transaction validation, the validator will receive rewards, which are shared with all stakers.

&gt;*By using your SOL tokens on the Solana blockchain, you can not only earn rewards, but also help secure the network.*

&amp;#x200B;

**How much can I make/earn in rewards when staking Solana?**

Currently **staking rewards are roughly 6–10% Annual Percentage Yield (APY)** on staked coins. This means that by simply staking SOL instead of selling I can earn roughly 6% -10% per year, which is **far better than the cash interest rates** paid by most banks. The staking rewards are distributed every epoch in Solana, currently every 2–3 days.

**Best way to stake** (highest rewards) currently is OKX (central exchange) with 8.4%-10%.

personalfinance,Cap gains in a mutual fund,"So I’ve run into something that is sort of frustrating as I did my taxes and I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do in the future to better manage this. 

My spouse has four mutual mutual funds set up by grandparents for education purposes, but they were never used because my spouse earned scholarships and didn’t need to touch the money. We have never done anything with these funds and they’ve just been reinvesting dividends for years. The combined value is about $250k and it is all in taxable non-retirement accounts. 

Typically, we see anywhere from about $1,000 to $3,000 in capital gains a year in those funds. Just a rough estimate there. This year one of the funds did an exceptionally large distribution and paid out about $10k in long term capital gains to the fund, giving us about $13k in total capital gains. I haven’t looked closely enough at the details of my TurboTax return yet but I believe this also pushed up a tax bracket and pushed us from getting a smallish refund of about $1,000 to owing nearly $2,000 in federal and state income taxes. 

I don’t personally manage these accounts because they are in my spouse’s name, so I don’t know all of the details other than what I do at tax time and some occasional tracking of our net worth. This caught me off guard. Obviously we are thrilled to have received the distribution and it outweighs the tax burden, but I feel like there has to be a way for us to better manage this so we don’t get hit with an unexpected tax bill like we did this time.

Any suggestions on how to handle this moving forward? What could I have done better this time?",finance,1645406040.0
CryptoCurrency,Stop buying for a few years! Crypto winter is here!,"It’s here, the notorious crypto winter. Prices are falling and we have another 3ish years to wait before the next Bitcoin halving. Prices are bound to be super low. You should always be looking to buy high, sell low, and now is not the time to buy!

Experienced crypto enthusiasts will tell you that during a bear market is the time to stop accumulating assets. You will want to liquidate all your positions that you FOMO’d into during the past bull run. That way, you can avoid paying capital gains taxes and claim losses to reduce your taxable income. 

You will want to wait a few months before selling everything, preferably after the fed interest rate increase, after Russia invades Ukraine, regulatory bodies coming down hard on crypto, and other bad, so you know the market has absolutely bottomed out. Selling at the bottom is probably the most important part of a buy high, sell low strategy. 

By following this strategy, in 2025 you can say, “I’m so glad I didn’t buy ETH at $2500 and BTC $25k,” because then you can commiserate with everyone who didn’t buy. Misery loves company and it’s lonely at the top, which means it’s better to have people around you. You’ll also be able to comfort yourself next bull run when you buy at the next ATH by saying “we’re still early” instead of worrying about family and friends always asking to borrow money. Stop buying now so you don’t have to worry about mo’ money mo’ problems later. It’s an absolute win!

personalfinance,"Wife and I, looking for first house, she has no income history.","We live in the United States. Myself (28M) and my wife (26F) are looking to buy our first home.

My wife is graduating dental school and will be done in May. I work for a medium corporation and make $110,000 /year. My wife has no student loan debt and I have about $100,000. We are looking to buy a home in Columbus, OH and the market here has been very hot! Definitely a sellers market with people needing to pay well above asking price in order to have a shot at landing a home.

I attribute this to very low interest rates on mortgages and the number of millennials like ourselves that are ready to jump into the housing market after the pandemic.

Our issue is that, from my understanding anyway, that banks will likely lend you money if you can demonstrate a couple years of reliable income. My wife will be running her own business after dental school as she begins to work at her parents' practice.

We want to buy a house prior to the fed raising the rates substantially, but houses are very expensive in our area and very competitive.

TLDR; Do we wait until my wife has demonstrated income before we approach a mortgage lender in the hopes of buying a better home? Or settle for a home we may be less happy with at a lower interest rate?

stocks,"Do you think Cathie Wood is right to say: ""the idea of shorting innovation is, in America, ridiculous I think.""","A few days ago, Cathie Wood did an interview with CNBC where she talked about the bear market that technology stocks are currently facing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Specifically, Wood responded to the launch of the Short Innovation ETF, an ETF created by Tuttle Capital Management that seeks to produce the inverse daily returns of Ark Invest's flagship Disruptive Innovation ETF.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Since its launch late last year, the SARK ETF has soared 55% while the ARKK ETF has declined by 42% over the same time period.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; ""They're \[Tuttle Capital\] shorting innovation and that seems to me, over time, that's not going to be a business if you ask me. But they're also not doing any research. They're simply shorting innovation. If they were doing research and could point us to reasons why what we \[own\] is not going to participate in the new world order, then we might have a conversation about it. But the idea of shorting innovation is, in America, ridiculous I think,"" Wood said. 

In my view, she does have a legitimate point. Of course, I understand first that many technology stocks that achieved sky-high valuations during the pandemic did so only because of cheap money, low-interest rates, and behavioral and societal changes; and that the high valuations achieved are not sustainable nor are they justified. 

But, looking at the long term, shouldn't technology be in a bull market? The pandemic seems/feels like an inflection point for technology and advancements that those who fail to foresee and capture will be left behind. Things are only ever going to become more digitized, the way we live will change, so shorting innovative technology stocks in the long term seems foolish.

This is just my two cents. Of course, I understand the idea of waiting out the bear market to get a better entry point for most of these stocks, as the volatility due to the Russian-Ukraine tensions, Inflation, and interest rates make it difficult to enter currently.",finance,1645411793.0

From Deep Risk by Bernstein

**Deep Risk – Young investors series**

-	2 types of Risk
  - Shallow Risk – loss of real capital that recovers relatively quickly
  - Deep Risk – permanent loss of real capital
-	Permanent loss of capital (negative real return over a 30-year period)
    - Severe, prolonged hyperinflation – hurts stocks and bonds but bonds more
      - Wide diversification among international markets
      - A tilt toward value stocks and commodity producing companies
      - Gold bullion
      - Inflation protected securities and annuities
      - Fixed rate mortgages
  - Gold bullion protects poorly against inflation and currency shocks
  - Gold bullion does superbly with deflation
  - Gold bullion does best when the public loses faith in the financial system
  - Gold bullion is great for hyperinflation
  - PME do not protect against deflation or certain disaster scenarios like gold bullion does
  - You have to make choices as to what and how much you want to defend against
  - Stocks in the US have done best when inflation ran between 0-4%.
  - Stocks do protect against inflationary deep risk, but not in the short term. But they do protect against inflation in the long term
    - To put it another way stocks, protect against deep risk, but exacerbate shallow risk
  - Widespread diversification of stocks protects against inflation because it is unlikely that all nations would have massive hyperinflation at once
  - Inflation devastates bondholders. Especially when it is a surprise/unexpected.
 - Fixed rate mortgage payments are also good for inflation
  - A value tilt also provides protection against inflation. This worked in both domestic and international
  - Inflation is the most likely of the scenarios to play out. But is the easiest to protect against.
    - International diversification
    - Value Tilt
    - PME
    - Natural Resource Stocks
    - Retired people should use TIPS

Skating Where the Puck Was

-	When credit contracts during a crisis, investors reevaluate their risk tolerance, seek the comfort of government secured vehicles, and dump all their risky assets - ALL OF THEM
-	Short term crashes can be painful, but long-term returns are far more important to wealth creation and destruction
-	Resign yourself that diversifying among risky assets provides scant shelter from bad days or bad years, but that it does help protect against bad decades and generations. Which can be far more destructive to wealth

Rational Expectations

-	Stocks that have the potential to have high returns during crises, especially inflationary ones, should consequently have the lowest returns of all among equity classes (Like PME)
-	William Bernstein believes in 3 different industry groups for consideration into a portfolio
  1. REITs
  2. Precious Metal Equity (PME)
  3. Oil/Natural Resource Equity (NR)
-	Oil and Natural Resource stocks are a great inflation hedge and under appropriate circumstances, might not be unreasonable to have additional allocation to commodities producers
-	Don&amp;#39;t purchase commodity futures. They are great in theory but not in practice. There used to be &amp;quot;Backwardation&amp;quot; in the futures market when investors were scared on deflation in their products and needed downside protection (IE a farmer selling his wheat crop in 9 months). Now inflation is the primary concern and futures contracts are in a condition known as &amp;quot;contango&amp;quot; which drives up the costs and reduces future returns

4 Pillars

-	PM funds have low expected return. But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM. Because you will be going against the market and you need to rebalance during. You will be selling when everyone on TV is saying to BUY and you will be buying when everything is good and people will tell you how dumb that is.

The only guide to alternative investments

-	REIT&amp;#39;s are a great choice. But do not invest in mortgage REIT&amp;#39;s as they are bonds and not equity
-	REIT&amp;#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds. This is true of domestic and international
-	International REIT&amp;#39;s can provide a benefit but their expenses tend to be higher so be careful. A 50/50 domestic and international REIT AA is a good starting place
-	Do not treat your personal home as a financial asset. It is a place to live. It should not be included in your overall AA plan
-	Investors who are not real estate professionals should gain exposure to REIT&amp;#39;s though low-cost mutual funds and not directly buy properties as a way to achieve broad diversification
-	REIT&amp;#39;s provide a reasonably good long-term hedge against inflation
-	5-15% is a good AA for REIT&amp;#39;s in your portfolio
-	TIPS provide a guaranteed rate of return and are less volatile than nominal return bonds
-	TIPS have a lower correlation to equities than nominal return bonds
-	Commodities (Hard Assets) have negative correlation to stocks and bonds and act as a hedge against event risk (wars, disruptions, political instability, etc.) and inflation. Usually made up of Energy, Industrial Metals, PM, Ag, Livestock
-	CCF&amp;#39;s do will during times of rising or unexpected inflation. But do poorly during times low or falling inflation
-	Larry Swedroe likes Collateralized commodity futures (CCF) and not the actual producers
-	William Bernstein likes commodities, but not CCF&amp;#39;s. He likes the actual commodity producers(Example - Oil and Materials). They won&amp;#39;t provide protection from Shallow Risk like the CCF will, but they will provide protection from deep risk.
-	PME&amp;#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds both domestic and international
-	Excellent hedge against inflation. Especially good for retired persons who need a hedge against inflation
-	There is a large rebalancing bonus (as much as 5%)
-	PME are HIGHLY volatile so be careful and rebalance
-	PME tend to experience long periods of very low returns during periods of economic and political stability and short periods of high returns in times of crisis

Global investing

-	There is a weak negative correlation between inflation rates and stock returns
-	The short-term relation between equity returns and inflation is weak, but over the long term equity returns impound inflation rates
  - In 1920&amp;#39;s Germany Hyperinflation, stocks hedged inflation well, but investors would have been better off if inflation didn&amp;#39;t take place
-	The negative relation between stocks and inflation is a short to intermediate term phenomenon. Over the longer terms, stocks behave as claims to real economics assets
-	Inflation is likely to remain a factor in society, primarily because governments spend more than they receive in taxes, forcing the governments to borrow. Monetization of this debt causes inflation.
-	Over the long term, real estate should provide returns competitive with those on stocks and bonds, and its low correlation with other assets makes it valuable for diversification. Real estate has also been a superior inflation hedge
-	Commodities futures have low correlations with other assets.
  - Commodities and bonds tend to act opposite each other
    - Why? Commodity futures are claims to real assets, while bonds are claims to money payments
-	Gold was more volatile than commodity futures but had a better return.
-	Commodity futures tracked inflation fairly well, but underperformed it

The delusions of crowds

-	Market Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions
  - Technological and financial displacement
  - Credit loosening
  - Amnesia of the past
  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles
-	Under most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things
  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)
  - Keeping inflation under control
    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies
-	The Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)
  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true

Asset Allocation

-	No liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes
-	Governments are the primary beneficiaries of inflation, in part because of tax structures that tax nominal rather than real incomes
-	Common stocks do much better in a low inflation environment. They have performed poorly during deflation or high inflation, especially if the inflation is unexpected.
  - Over the longer run, the companies can make adjustments to inflation, but in the short run those adjustments are difficult to accomplish

A Random Walk Down Wall Street

-	Exercise 6 – Buy a house. Real estate is a great inflation hedge. REIT&amp;#39;s are a good choice to own commercial real estate
-	Exercise 8 – Gold can have a place in your portfolio (5%). It is a good diversifier and is an excellent inflation hedge. Don&amp;#39;t invest in diamonds or Collectibles. Buy diamonds and collectibles because you like them. Not as an investment. Do NOT invest in commodities futures contracts. You will get burned. Stay away from hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital funds. They are great for the managers, not for you

Stocks For the Long Run

-	Under a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&amp;#39;s. Under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. Thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds
-	Because of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again

-	Bonds are bad during inflation as they are fixed income investments whose cash flows are not adjusted for inflation.
  - It is also bad for the stock market. Stocks have proved to be poor hedges against inflation in the short run. But are great in the long run
-	Although fascinating to observe and understand a market&amp;#39;s reaction, investing on the basis of data releases (CPI, unemployment, etc.) is a tricky game and best left to speculators. Most investors will do well to watch from the sidelines and stick to a long-term investment strategy.

-	Inflation and Deflation have characterized history as far back as economists have gathered data. But since 1955, there has never been a single year in which the US consumer price index declined
-	Why the shift, because instead of Gold having control, now the government does and they always provide liquidity to prevent prices from declining
-	The market used to react more to fed policy. But investors have become so geared to watching and anticipating Fed policy that the effect of its tightening or easing is already in the market.
-	Stocks have an inflation hedge or an ability to maintain its purchasing power during periods of inflation
-	Since stocks are claims on the earnings of real assets, assets whose value is intrinsically related to the price of the goods and services they produce, one should expect that their long-term returns will not be harmed by inflation
-	Stock are not good hedges against inflation in the short term, but no financial asset is. In the long run however, stocks are very good hedges against inflation, while bonds are not
-	Smith&amp;#39;s Common Stocks and Long-Term Investments showed that stocks outperform bonds in times of falling and well as rising prices.
-	Fisher found that in theory, stocks will be an ideal inflation hedge
-	If inflation rears its head again, investors will do much better in stocks than bonds

Safe Havens

-	Gold
    - Hedge against the banking system.
    - No counter party risk.
    - Historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. But, is a very noisy hedge against inflation.
      - It is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (When inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices).
    - Mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&amp;#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&amp;#39;s.
    - Gold is all about investors&amp;#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value.
      - It is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value. Its payoff profile is largely statistical as expected.
    - During the 1970&amp;#39;s, golds payoff profile made it very cost effective as a safe haven, outside of that, gold has been much less cost effective.
      - Gold has required a tactical call regarding inflation or real interest rates in order to be a cost-effective safe haven.
      - This means we need certain things to go right for gold to be an effective safe haven in mitigating systemic risk (of a crash), much less cost-effective.
      - The amount of gold needed to fully hedge our portfolio is very high adding to its carry costs.

IAA

-	REIT&amp;#39;s and Precious Metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns
  - They are inflation hedges and likely to do well in an inflationary environment in which other stocks and bonds would be adversely affected

CryptoCurrency,Tip for noobs: How much risk is enough (16+ years experience in investments),"So I just seen a post about someone losing half of their portfolio on 1 alt coin that is new.  IDK how true it was, and I wonder how much they lost. But this does bring up a problem. There is 2 types of people I ran into the most here and both IMO is wrong.

1. This person is all into new coins and really doesn't touch any old coins. I think this mindset comes in with how it is seriously unlikely you will get a 100x from BTC anymore. So they feel they must maximize their risk to get serious gains.
2. This person is anti higher risk coins. Like it is the type that thinks any coin with dog or safe in the name is a scam or should be avoided at all cost. I think the reasoning behind this is the higher risk, and they don't think about what I'm going to talk about.

&amp;#x200B;

After 16 years in dealing with a number of types of investments, I can tell you it is best to manage your risk. This is how I do things.

Assuming it is easy for me to sell off and put whatever money into whatever card for day to day life. I take a look at taxes and inflation. In the USA if you hold stocks, crypto, etc for over 12 months then it is considered as long term investment. Federally this number changes, but I think this year it is $40k. If I make less than $40k in long term capital gains then federally there is no taxes. Locally I think it is 5.5% or 5.25% no matter if it is long term or short. 

Now looking at inflation. On the average year it is about 5%. Which means my money needs to make at minimum 5% more year over year to keep whatever buying power (before taxes and fees). 

&amp;#x200B;

So lets say my goal is to do slightly better than the inflation rate, but not to have the massive year over year swings outside of bull season. I would look at something stable enough, that is widely trusted, and that is likely to get me enough of a return that in the long run it will make a real difference. This is where I would put the majority of my money normally, and I would use it as a savings. Like as long as it is held longer than 1 year, then at least federally it is tax free and it is somewhat safe. The only time I don't make this my majority is if I'm rapidly trying to grow my portfolio.

Now, I would take a good % of what I don't need over a time and I will take part of that and push into projects that I think is truly undervalue like VET or THETA. Something I'm not worried with a rug pull, but I think is extremely underpriced. Then I take the rest and shot gun it on the new new projects. These I might give $5-$10 to see what happens. If it is a rug pull, then I'm out just a few dollars. If it jumps a little, then I take a look at the project a bit more and see if it is worth adding more money into it. After adding more money into these projects, I can easily see some of them become 10%-20% of my portfolio value. Obviously, in the off season I will look at adjusting things and this is when I get into the nuts in bolts of all the projects to see how I should readjust things.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember talking to another investor, but they deal more as an angel investor. They mentioned 60% of what they invest into never pay off, but the 40% pays for the loss and then some. Keep in mind this given person was worth over $100M. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now with all this in mind, if you truly don't have much money to start with. Then you honestly don't have a choice. Like you can pick using this as retirement, and doing a slow growth. Or you must take extreme risk in hopes it will pay off. Like 20% of $1M is $200k. Where 20% of $100 is $20. It simply isn't enough to make a difference, and sadly life isn't fair.

But it is likely you will switch from going pure/majority risk to majority low risk after you made a good bit. The reason is you are switching from rapid growth to projecting what you have. 

But IMO most investments are best to be looked at as long term and not for swing trading. Even more if you don't have the experience or the gut to deal with the worry.",cryptocurrency,1645424587.0

worldpolitics,Working together for mutual benefit,"Over the past few years, the development of the Asia-Pacific region has been steadily gaining momentum. New ties and relations between countries continue to be forged in various spheres of activity. The focus of the world's attention is shifting from the West to the East, and the United States is particularly concerned about the development of the Asia-Pacific region. Of course, the U.S. government representatives are not just watching and ""worrying,"" they are showing maximum activity in the East, expanding their military presence and interfering in the internal affairs of APR countries by all means. The goal of the U.S. is not only to contain the growing influence of Russia and China in the region, but also to take the leading position. However, the Russian Federation has no plans to give up its place as one of the main players in the ""Eastern arena,"" and every year it strengthens comprehensive cooperation with the states of the Asia-Pacific region.  
One of the most significant events over the past week was the meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. On February 4, 2022 in Beijing, the heads of states signed a ""Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China on International Relations in the New Era and Global Sustainable Development.  
The statement not only focuses on the prosperity of bilateral relations between China and Russia, but also defines the peace-loving nature of the foreign policy of the two countries. President Xi and President Putin spoke out against further NATO expansion and condemned any attempts to create interstate blocs, saying that such actions seriously undermine international security. The leaders also emphasized the need to protect democracy, freedom and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of neighbors. The economic sphere was not ignored: Vladimir Putin announced a new contract to supply China with 10 billion cubic meters of gas a year from fields in the Far East.  
Despite U.S. attempts to influence the Russian-Japanese relations by means of provocative statements on the issue of the Kuril Islands, Japan still remains one of Russia's trade partners in the Asia-Pacific region. Thus, at the opening ceremony of the ""Year of Russia-Japan Interregional and Twinning Exchanges"", which was extended until the end of 2022, the Governor of Primorsky Krai Oleg Kozhemyako said that in nine months of 2021 the trade turnover between Primorye and Japan increased by 27%. And Takako Suzuki, senior vice-minister of foreign affairs of Japan, added in her speech that joint projects such as development of the COVID-19 express test and implementation of wind energy in the Far East and Siberia have been implemented. The Russian side, in turn, called the creation of Hokuto medical centers in the region a good example of how Japanese experience is applied to improve the lives of Russians.  
Thus, the Russian government strictly adheres to the foreign policy course aimed at preserving the region's security and developing harmonious international relations. At the same time, Russia, unlike the U.S., which pursues only its own interests, declares the mutual benefit of all participants in relations as one of the priorities of cooperation.",energy,1645429146.0

Does QT lead to bear steepening or bear flattening? i.e. when QT starts, would you go long 10Y-3M (or 10Y-2Y) spread or short it?

Background:
So during QE, the fed buys shit ton of long tenor treasuries like 10Y and beyond. So QT would imply that the Fed will sell off these treasuries. So wouldn't this imply that 10Y yields will go up around QT and lead to bear steepening? However whenever I read online, it always points to the idea that QT leads to bear flattening i.e. short term yields go even further up, compared to long term yields.

One reason I could think for that - when the Fed bought 10Y bonds for QE sometime ago, those bonds now are not 10Y but say 8Y maturities since time passed by lol. So effectively they will be selling off slightly lower tenor maturity. But then this is not a very strong argument since the maturity wont change by much. So the confusion still remains, why wouldn't QT lead to bear steepening?    

So I guess the question is, is the FF rate hike more strong in its impact than selling off of long tenor treasuries. This is bcs QT will happen during the rate hike cycle.",finance,1645433329.0

CryptoCurrency,A basic formula for restaking,"So I see people ask on here occasionally how often they should take interest on staked coins, liquidity pools, et cetera.

So as a PSA for those who are just starting to dip their toes into defi and don't know, there's a fairly simple rule of thumb which (while not perfect) can give you a decent idea.


It's C=m(it)^2

C is the total cost of taking the interest and restaking it (and anything in between, like swap fees).

m is how much you already have invested and earning interest.

i is the annual interest rate without compounding at all (APR).

t is the time period since you last restaked, in years. Yes, it is usually less than 1.

Explanation:

To start, mit is the amount you'll be recieving when you take your interest - the amount earning the interest, times the interest per year, times the number of years.

Thus (mit)*(it) is the amount of additional interest *on* that interest you'll have earned by the *next* time you take your interest. And (mit)*(it) is the same as m(it)^2

This means that when C=m(it)^2 , the interest *on* your interest from period 1 will exactly cover the cost of restaking again in period 2. It's obvious why restaking it sooner than this is a bad idea - if C&gt;m(it)^2 you'll actually have less money earning interest after two restakes than if you'd skipped the first restaking entirely.

Obviously, as you compound, m will increase. So from time to time you want to recalculate. When you do, you want to calculate using the m from just *before* you last restaked - the mit from your last restake is still paying for itself.

This method isn't perfect, and it *does* make a couple of assumptions.

The two most relevant assumptions for crypto are that it assumes the cost and interest rate are fixed (for a lot of crypto products they aren't, but hopefully if you're using a basic rule of thumb like this you're not investing in anything *too* unstable), and that it assumes you'll be restaking at the same interest rate you initially staked at (sometimes your rewards for staking Acoin might be Bthereum, and you might want to stake the Bthereum rather than converting it to Acoin). The first is pretty hard to adjust for, the second is easier, but still makes for a harder to remember formula than C=m(it)^2

defi,SVN (Savanna) Whitepaper Fundamentals Review,"First things first, I wasn't able to find a Whitepaper for SVN -- so I've based this review off their docs.

This is an example of the reviews I would make, first raised here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/ssya2h/whitepaper\_screening\_finding\_projects\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/ssya2h/whitepaper_screening_finding_projects_with/)

Savanna Finance:

Overview:

The Problem they’re trying to solve:

* Savanna Finance’s goal is to create a algorithmic based stable coin against MMF

Questions that I raise::

* First red flag for me – why do we need a stablecoin for MMF in anycase?  Seems kinda bizarre – they don’t seem to be a particularly stable token themselves, and the justification in “Why launch SVN?” seems equally weird.  They basically say that they want to supply limit MMF, which will drive up the price, but use SVN as an identical source of additional supply.
* They say “The beauty of algorithmic stable coins is that they are much more capital efficient than their collateralized cousins.” – which is true, but they are also far more risky. Without any collateral you’re placing a significant amount of burden on the protocol – someone needs to guarantee it for it to work.

1 minute gut Conclusion:

* I don’t know why in the world we need a MMF stablecoin.  I guess if you like MMF you could buy this – but you might as well buy MMF, no? 

The Economics:

Alright let’s get down to the juicy stuff.  Let’s check out the mechanism and see how it works

Basic mechanism:

For a stablecoin there are two price directions that need to be protected against – appreciation (where the stablecoin goes up relative to the token it is meant to peg to), and depreciation (where it goes down).  Typically upwards movements are easier to deal with – you simply have to create more stablecoin.  This is what Savanna does – when the stablecoin is above the peg then more SVN is minted.  

The bigger issue is what happens when the stablecoin goes down.  Savanna’s solution is to offer Meerkat Bonds (MBond), which people can buy.  From what I can see, their main use is to sell when the stablecoin is above the 1:1 ratio, with bonus rewards for waiting until it’s over 1:1.1.

The issue that I see is that there doesn’t seem to be any intrinsic yield to these MBonds – there is (I presume, but I can’t find a clear answer in the docs) a floating interest rate, but this only seems to come into effect when you sell your MBonds for SVN.

Do we see the issues here?  A clear issue is that MBonds is not really a way to destroy SVN – MBonds don’t have any utility other than to convert to SVN in the future.  So what will happen is that new SVN will be minted when the stablecoin is over the peg, then when it inevitably drops below the peg then some of that SVN will become MBonds.  Clearly this will lead to an inflationary protocol – SVN and MBonds can be thought of as linked entities, and there is a constantly increasing supply of these.

Beyond this, however, is the fundamental fact that there doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason to buy MBonds – and of course, if no one buys MBonds then the peg isn’t maintained.  The authors of the protocol themselves admit this – their answer to the question is: “First and most important reason is Bonds help maintain the peg, but will not be the only measure use to keep the protocol on track.”-- which sounds like a reason why the protocol needs ME to buy MBonds, not why I should.

Yes there are potential “rewards” but these are all based on the peg getting back to even or above – and there’s no fundamental economic reason that it should return to the peg.  Contrast this with DAI’s automatic pegging system – in their collateralised system, there is a immediate arbitrage opportunity for anyone who has borrowed DAI to buy and return it if it drops below the peg, and an immediate arbitrage opportunity for anyone to borrow DAI if it goes above the peg.  No such mechanism is here.

Do I buy it?

After reviewing all the facts I give this protocol a score of Z (zero).  I can’t see why we need a stablecoin attached to something that doesn’t have widely accepted use in the real world.  Even if we accept that we do, the mechanism that they use doesn’t look like it’ll lead to a stable peg.  

If you must invest, here are the questions you need to answer to yourself to make sure you’re not getting sucked in:

* Do we fundamentally believe in MMF?
* Why do we need a stablecoin for MMF – why wouldn’t you just buy MMF instead (The authors say that there’ll be supply issues, but I don’t see how a 1-1 peg will alleviate price issues then)?
* Do we think that this pegging algorithm works – in other words, can you see yourself buying MBonds if the peg drops below a certain amount, knowing that you’ll only get returns if it rises back over?  And do you trust your fellow SVN holders to do so?  And not just once, but everytime.",cryptocurrency,1645446564.0

Do you remember the first time you heard the word “Fintech”? When I first heard the term, I thought it was some rare Pokémon or an item on the Japanese restaurant menu. It turns out, fintech is neither of those.

Short for “financial technology”, fintech is the term that describes any sort of technology that helps consumers or businesses deliver financial services in newer, faster ways than traditionally were available. Think of investing apps like Robinhood, or even cryptocurrency exchange apps like Binance - these are examples of fintech.

**In this guide we will be analyzing 2 fintech companies-** [**PayPal (Ticker: PYPL)**](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/quote/PYPL) **and** [**Block (Ticker: SQ).**](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/quote/SQ)

# What does PayPal do?

PayPal enables you to swiftly send or request money to anyone in the world and make easy online payments without entering your credit card/shipping information to the platform you purchase on. The company offers buyer protection, so when you purchase something through PayPal, you have the company’s backing that you get what you paid for otherwise you get a full refund if something goes wrong.

They are also the parent company of Venmo - a peer-to-peer transaction platform where you can quickly send and receive money to friends and family within the U.S. PayPal also offers other services such as debit cards for payments, credit card readers for small merchants, and lines of credit.

# What does Block do?

Block, formerly known as Square, provides an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services to both businesses and consumers. Like its name, the company is composed of 5 building blocks with the stated purpose of expanding access to the economy- Square, Cash app, Tidal, Spiral, and TBD54566975.

Their business model is to cover all your financial needs; point-of-sale payment processing hardware, a convenient, quick-access money transfer application, a bitcoin/stock investment platform, loans- The company is an all-in-one inclusive platform for everything finance-related.

# Block vs Paypal: Financial Data Analysis

### SQ vs PYPL Revenue Analysis

Let’s begin our analysis by examining the revenue each company has generated over the past couple of years. This will signal to us the market demand for each company’s offering:

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the PYPL vs SQ revenue chart, PayPal has consistently been yielding higher revenue than Block over time. This is what we would expect, as PayPal is a significantly bigger company than Block. PayPal has 426 million active users, while Block currently has 36 million monthly active users.

Notice the drop in Block revenue beginning in March 2021. The reason for this drop is that the company’s revenue is to some degree correlated with the price of bitcoin, and the price of bitcoin as well has seen a drop around the same time, falling from 61,823$ in March 2021 to 41,840 in September 2021.

A large degree of Block's revenue is generated from bitcoin purchases on their Cash App; Block collects a 2% fee from these cryptocurrency exchanges. When the price of bitcoin falls, so does the company’s revenue. Users can also purchase bitcoin with PayPal, but most of PayPal’s revenue is from payment transaction fees in US dollars- not bitcoin.

The takeaway from this is that PayPal seems to be a “safer” investment. The company is more established, as evidenced by its gigantic consumer base and consistent revenue growth rates over time. In contrast, Block’s revenue is not as large as PayPal’s, and is correlated with the price of bitcoin-which itself is highly volatile these days.

### SQ vs PYPL Gross Profit Margin Analysis

&amp;#x200B;

[*This Pypl vs Sq stock chart* ](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/SQ:PYPL/block%20,inc%20:%20paypal%20holdings,%20inc/Gross%20Profit%20Margin)*displays each company’s gross profit margin since March 2019. Gross profit margin tells us how efficient the company is at generating profit for every dollar of cost involved. To analyze gross profit margin and many other metrics of different stocks, visit Jika.io’s free Analyze Tool today.*

As you can see from the above chart, PayPal shows an impressive gross profit margin range, fluctuating between 25% to 50% over the past 3 years. In comparison, Block as well has seen a healthy gross profit margin- but less impressive than PayPal's. The company’s gross profit margin is starting to make a comeback, and as of September 2021 stands at 30%. This means that each company’s revenue far exceeds the cost to produce that revenue.

Both companies display relatively high price-to-sales ratios, as shown from the [SQ vs Pypl graph above.](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/SQ:PYPL/block%20,inc%20:%20paypal%20holdings,%20inc/price%20to%20sales) This metric compares the stock price to revenue and signals how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of sales for a stock. The main takeaway from the above graph is “proceed with caution”. As both companies display relatively high P/S ratios, it may signal that each stock is approaching overvalued territory in the stock market.

# PayPal or Block: What are the differences

There is a key difference between PayPal and Block. Block’s business model immerses the user with all the necessary financial tools to run a business and may completely disrupt the payments market as we know it.

PayPal’s business model is built on top of credit card networks that work with banks to complete transactions. PayPal facilitates the payment process; Block has created its own payment processing ecosystem.

Block may have far greater potential to make an impact in the payments industry if more people join their platform. If more people join their platform, we may see an increase in their gross profit margin as the company becomes more efficient at turning revenue to profit.

# Paypal and Block Position in the Fintech Industry

It pays to have a watchful eye on both Block and PayPal- each stock has experienced a tremendous pullback in response to the Fed’s plan to hike interest rates, and both are currently being traded at their respective 52-week lows. Both companies demonstrate strong gross profit margins and are part of a modern and disruptive industry that is changing the way we conduct payments.

It is also important to note, that this space is highly competitive, as many other fintech companies are emerging with their own method of payment processing. While some would claim that Paypal and Block are the best stock What will ultimately determine the success of each company is if it can expand its consumer base to increase profitability and drive revenue.

# Should You Buy Block Stock?

Although Block is a riskier investment, there is more potential for growth as the company continues to innovate and develop its financial ecosystem.

Block only operates within the U.S, while PayPal operates internationally- if Block can successfully expand to the global market, we may see very high profitability growth in the future. And if bitcoin rises in valuation, so will Block. Buy or sell? Its really a question of whether you are willing to take the risk.

# Is PayPal a Good Stock to Buy?

PayPal has a proven track record of earnings and sales growth. The company has processed an astounding 1.25 trillion dollars in total payment volume FYE 2021 and is the market leader in online payment solutions. PayPal’s main challenge is protecting a competitive edge in an industry where many other competitors are entering with even lower transaction fees and monthly fees. This is a challenge Block worries less about, since they offer a unique financial ecosystem that’s harder to imitate.

# Which Fintech to Invest In?

As expressed in this article, If you are willing to take on extra risk for a higher price target potential, invest in Block. If you prefer a safer, more established company with less potential, choose PayPal.

personalfinance,Turbo Tax - Tax Return - 1040 line 9 Total Income Exceeds actual income,"A little background, my company issues us Restricted Stock Units each year. I have my settings set up to sell all RSU's as they vest, and use the proceeds to cover taxes. So when this happens, we get a paystub for 0 hours in ADP right next to our actual paystubs. (This is also reflected on my W2 for gross income)

Here is an example of the info in an RSU 'paystub' that we would see:

RATE 0  HOURS 0

EARNINGS:

Rsu Vest 10,657.48 

Gross Pay 10,657.48

&amp;#x200B;

DEDUCTIONS -$3,958.19:

Federal income Tax -$2,344.65

Social Security Tax -$660.76

Medicare Tax -$154.53

State Income Tax -$744.96

Paid Family Leave Ins -$53.29

&amp;#x200B;

OTHER:

Stock  -$6,699.29

(This is what's left over that is xferred to a bank account)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So my W2 Box 1 for total income includes the gross income &amp; income tax from these RSU's just as if they were paychecks.

But when I got the 1099-B from the Finance company for the RSU's, I noticed box 4 'Federal Income Tax Withheld' says $0. I'm guessing this is true to the extent that investment firm must have handed off the gross RSU amount to my employer before my employer processed the taxes.

Because of this, after processing the 1099 for the RSU's in Turbo Tax, line 9 on the 1040 for total income has increased by the gross RSU amounts, because those gross amounts are totaled on line 7 as Capital Gain.

Now I realize I would have to pay tax on Capital Gain, but is it normal for line 9 to exceed my actual total income, considering the fact the my W2 totals my paychecks and RSU's together? It feels like the Income tax is happening twice for the RSU's here.",finance,1645455333.0

With the cash out my plan was to pay off the least expensive house which has a long term tenant in it. Even with paying off one house there would be cash left over and that would be used for paying off some cc debt (less than $7k) as well as fully paying off my only car loan. 

With the $90 reduction in mortgages, no cc or car payment plus zero mortgage on one house it’s a net cash flow of $1300 that can be reinvested monthly but my thought recently is that I could take the large chunk for the house and put that into an investment. (The house interest rate is 4.3%) 

which of these would be the better option? What am I not considering.

CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA+ Experiment - Week 18 Update,"It’s that time again and sadly it’s another bad update for my DCA project.

For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi) as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the community to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my own research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some DD. I have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous posts and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be chosen by the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end of the experiment. For the starting point you can look here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3 and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ssettw/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_17_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

As of last week when I posted the experiment was down 18.5% and I had signaled some fear heading into the week that it was going to be a bad week. Unfortunately my fears were completely founded and one week later, another $100 invested and the value of the portfolio is down over $100 relative to last week with an overall performance since this started in October of over 25% down. Not where I was hoping to be at this point in the experiment, but I’ll look at the positive, this is a chance for some accumulation at what, in a year will hopefully look like good prices for most of these projects.

Who knows where we go from here, but honestly I think the market has priced in a lot of the negative news. Uncertainty in Ukraine/Russia (which I had commented last week I didn’t think was driving it, although I’ve changed my tune and now think that is having a bigger impact than I previously did) is certainly priced in at this point. Of course an attack might cause another downward movement, but I think it’s largely priced in at this point. Uncertainty around interest rates is also priced in. I think at this time last week the market was expecting a quarter basis point hike in March. I think there is some concern now that it may be more like a half point and the pace may be quicker than previously expected, so I think that is now mostly priced in as well. The pending EO from Biden which I think is keeping any strong bull action from succeeding. If that brings very bad news then perhaps we could push lower, but honestly I expect that it will be nothing more than designating authority to the SEC and other federal agencies to look into what can and should be done to ensure consumer protection. If that is the case, I think it will actually provide a slight bump to the market as I think we’ve priced in worse news. So, while I’m not exactly bullish right now, I do think that a lot of the worst news is priced in already and it would take some unforeseen negative news to push us considerably lower.

In addition to my normal musings, I do have one other course of action I need to sort out and that is where to continue my purchases of BTC, ETH and BUSD for my controls. I had been making the purchases on BlockFi but as any of you who have been following news on exchanges already know, BlockFi is no longer allowing US based customers to put new money into their interest accounts, so while I could still purchase additional BTC, ETH and BUSD, I wouldn’t be able to earn interest on any of the new amounts I purchase. I am likely going to open an account on Celsius and I’ll need to do it before the end of next week when I am set to make my purchase of those. I’m concerned that they may face similar regulations as BlockFi, but it seems to me the next best alternative for now which satisfies most of my criteria: legitimate company, rates that are somewhat believable, doesn’t seem to be overleveraged, legal in the US, relatively easy on/off ramp for fiat. If anyone has any other ideas for platforms I should look into, please feel free to promote your favorite in the comments.

Big news for this week is the fact that (not counting BUSD as a control) the current leader in the experiment is now Ripple, only being down 8%. This is the first week that XRP has been in first place in the experiment, sadly it’s for being the least bad. It’s only down about 3% from last week compared to most of the portfolio which is down 7%+ from last week. The big loser this week is……. once again TRAC. This has by far been the biggest dog of the experiment so far and week after week it just seems to get worse. One of these weeks it’s going to shock me and double, I just know it! After TRAC, the other coin that had a surprisingly bad week was CRO, down almost 20% after the Super Bowl. I guess the big ads didn’t pay off in terms of coin price, hopefully it got them a bunch of new subscribers at least. Let’s hope it stays low for a few more days as it’s part of my group C purchases planned for this week.

As it has been for the past couple of months, BTC is still beating the overall performance of the portfolio. ETH had been trailing the portfolio performance for the past few weeks but is now almost even with the overall portfolio (25.85% down versus 25.21% for the portfolio). If the downward trends continue, I suspect we’ll see both BTC and ETH beating the portfolio average soon.

Let’s hope for some positive news this week. I’m still pessimistic and worried that we’re going to see another bad week, but I think investors are getting tired of all the bad news and ready for a positive spark to chase a small rally. Let’s hope they get it from somewhere and we have a good week.

MachineLearning,[P] Here's our new framework for Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning,"We recently uploaded our framework for privacy attacks in federated learning. You can find it here: [https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching](https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching). We include a sizable number of known attacks for deep neural networks in vision and text domains and some new ones.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these attacks are based on ""gradient inversion"". In federated learning, each user receives the state of a machine learning model from the server and then computes a local update (in the simplest case just the gradient of model parameters) based on their private data. This update is then aggregated with other users and sent back to the server.The key question for privacy for this protocol is whether it is possible to recover the original user data from their update. This turns out to be possible in several cases which can be simulated and attacked with this code framework.

&amp;#x200B;

We also include [26 jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching/tree/main/examples) with examples and visualizations of these attacks. We hope this helps in replicating and extending some of the recent work in this topic. Let us know what you think!",technology,1645462795.0

Let me lay the groundwork with some numbers and anyone interest please weigh in on best course of action:

Income- husband (35) making $115k annually. Wife (33) now makes $125k annually. 

Investments- $450k in 401ks, $260k in Roth's, $80k in brokerage account, $60k in 529s. 

Mortgage- $180k principle, $300k home so approx $120k equity but would like to avoid PMI. 4.25% interest. Payment is $1,250 including insurance and taxes 

Student loans- Wife has $190k at a range of 4%-7% interest. Payment is $1,400 a month. 

Car loan- $18k at 3.5%. 

No other debt. 

Other monthly expenses around $4k a month. 

I am considering the following options:

Option 1: eliminate all student loans- refinance mortgage for a favorable interest rate and take the equity, brokerage, and scrape together cash to pay off the $190k. 

Option 2: eliminate high interest debt- take HELOC on home and pay down highest interest student loans. Snow ball remaining student loans as cash allows. 

Option 3: pay and deduct the interest and put cash toward more investments such as 401k, IRAs, 529s, rental property, or other ventures.

I'm open to a blend of these options or other options I have not considered.

personalfinance,Question regarding transportation costs,"This thought came to me after someone mentioning public transit in North America being poor compared to EU.

Often I see everyone saying that the 20/4/10 rule when it comes to buying a car.  
20% down, 4 years, 10% of monthly income.

Does this imply you're keeping your car for 4 years and then getting another? Or keeping the car until it dies.

I just want to see how people come up with these numbers, and if alternatives actually make more sense financially today. Especially with rising costs, stagnant salaries, and low interest rates that are going to be increased in the next few years.

My son is earning $40,000.  
Public transportation costs him $670/month. (Way above 10% of the monthly income!)  
But if you buy a used car, the 10% income allows him for $333/month. Which results in a lot of crappy cars that require major repairs and maintenance etc. in the next few years easily. Which adds cost.

If he bought a new vehicle, it would also cost him the same as public transportation, with payments + insurance + gas. Meanwhile, he would likely keep it for 10+ years.  After 4 years, he has 6 years of much less payments than public transit and a used car. A used car likely won't last you another 10 years if you bought it at $333/month. (And I'm not even calculating insurance).

I'm genuinely curious if someone can break this down for me. Because it's a bit wild to still use the 20/4/10 rule today during the pandemic when used cars are crazy expensive.",finance,1645468565.0

economy,"Russia, future economy, gold, and inflation","I will try to summarize what I anticipate will happen. First, interest rates going up will have almost no impact on the increasing inflation. This is why the Fed has not done so immediately following the December CPI report and why it is still being delayed. The upcoming war with Russia may defer even further an interest rate hike as the US hopes and bets on a war scenario being a free pass to blame war for inflation as this has traditionally always been the natural outcome of war.

Russia is looking to slow roll this. They are positioning on Ukraine's eastern border for two reasons. They do plan to take Ukraine eventually, but it is primarily to stir up conflict and ""destabilize"" the region so that they have a reason, like they did a month ago in January, to enter Kazakhstan and control their capital. Except this time they will annex the country as their own. Kazakhstan has a whopping $17B in gold reserves compared to Russia's \~$120B. It offers a significant boost in economic power as the world's currencies go to shit. Kazakhstan is also overwhelmingly in favor of Russia and would not oppose this move, thus making it more difficult for the EU to contest it while setting the stage for surrounding regions to have amicable takeovers. Propaganda will run hot.

The US has the largest gold reserves in the world and will encourage this transition of value to gold once again. Meanwhile, every American citizen will lose the shirts on their backs from overinflated retirement funds invested in the S&amp;P 500. They will be cut in half. And unless individuals are borrowed against their homes and hold debt, their equity will disappear as well. The illusory veil of money will disappear and we will realize our time and the fruits of our labor has been robbed from us through US monetary policies over the past two or three decades. The US will transition into gold backed cryptocurrency arguing that it is stable and cost effective and will reduce costs for the average American by trillions!

Russia has little interest in taking territory while everyone's economies are doing well. They are purely looking to escalate our coming recession and position themselves to acquire precious metals, oil, infrastructure, and economic power as they slow roll their takeover of various former Russian territories in the region over the next ten years.

personalfinance,Paying taxes on interest from I-Bond purchased in late 2021?,"Hi all,

I purchased a $5k I-bond in mid-November of last year amidst all the hype. 

I expect that my income will continue to increase each year, so I would prefer to pay federal income tax on the interest yearly rather than paying when I eventually cash the bond (at least 5 years from now, I assume) or when it reaches maturity.

I understand that the 3-month interest penalty for cashing out before 5 years is already reflected when viewing the current value of I-bonds that are younger than 5 years, so my current value is still shown as $5,000.

But is it correct that I still technically accrued 1 month's-worth of interest in 2021 (i.e., the interest accrued but just isn't shown? Or due to the 3-month penalty would I not start accruing interest until this year?

I was looking around in ManageDirect and see that I have no Form 1099-INT for 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not at all unlikely that I'm misunderstanding or missing something obvious here, so any help or explanations y'all could point me to would be much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 

I understand that paying federal income tax on the interest is not  required until one cashes the bond, gives up ownership in some way, or  the bond matures (per [this page](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_itaxconsider.htm)), but they mention in the same breath that one can choose to report and pay taxes on the interest yearly. 

Assuming my income will continue to  increase between now and one of those three instances occurring, my  preference would be to report the interest yearly rather than defer all  the reporting to a year when I'll have to pay income tax on it at a higher  rate.

I just don't know how I  would go about doing that if I don't have a 1099-INT specifying the  amount of (unrealized) interest accrued in 2021. My concern is that if I  don't start reporting the interest yearly I may not be able to do so  for my 2022 taxes.",finance,1645475366.0

I dont want to give them less, but I also dont want to stop them from getting a decent trade in offer on this vehicle. They arent able to shop around for appraisals and would probably go for the 28k offer.

Is there something I am missing, perk wise, of buying an old, used, and ""high"" value vehicle from a family member? I am certain it was well taken care of and the majority of it's time was spent in a garage. Sure if this vehicle were priced around $20k I think it would be an easier decision, but since it's pushing 30k makes the decision a bit more difficult to make IMO, especially when we think about warranties and that peace of mind.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin miners exempt from IRS reporting rules: US Treasury Addresses miner concerns,"On January 26, 2022, eleven US representatives wrote to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in response to the Infrastructure Investment in Jobs Act’s definition of a “broker”, which they claimed was not fairly applicable to the nature of work carried out in the crypto industry. 

The Broadly Defined “Broker” 

The Act outlined that brokers would be required to collect detailed information about their customers and their trades, with those participating in crypto and the blockchain network included in the “broker” definition. It would have imposed unnecessary tax reporting burdens on crypto miners and stakers who don’t usually deal directly with their customers and do not have ready access to such information. 

Crypto Miners and Stakers To Be Exempt 

The US Treasury Department has since addressed these concerns, and on February 11, 2022 responded with a letter that indicated crypto miners and stakers will not be subject to the tax reporting requirements that will be implemented on exchanges. 

The Treasury implied that the requirements would pertain only to those who already have access to and use such detailed customer information: “Existing regulations impose broker reporting obligations only on market participants engaged in business activities that provide them with access to information about sales of securities by taxpayers.” 

The letter, written by Jonathan Davidson, an assistant Treasury secretary for legislative affairs, further clarified that “ancillary parties who cannot get access to information that is useful to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) are not intended to be captured by the reporting requirements for brokers.” 

This clarification comes as a relief to active members in the crypto industry, considering that an overly broad definition could be impossible for many participants to act in accordance with. 

Proposed Regulations and Next Steps 

The U.S. Treasury Department plans to issue additional proposed regulations that will reflect how a broker is defined. This issuance will follow a rulemaking process similar to those followed for other regulations that are implemented at the federal level. 

The crypto industry collectively made its concerns surrounding the Infrastructure Investment in Jobs Act’s broker definition heard, and these concerns were thus acknowledged and acted on. There are significant implications to be drawn here, pertaining to the role and presence of crypto actors becoming legitimized for future legislative decisions, especially when it comes to crypto activity.

1. What behavioural economics is
2. Why are we like that? Why are we so prone to influence?
3. How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics?

What is Behavioural EconomicsBehavioural economics is a specific field of economics research. It studies the effects of social norms and individual psychology on economics decisions. In classical economics, we assume that everyone is logical. In behavioural economics, we study why people are illogical and why they behave like that.For example, buying a 2 weeks worth of food during a pandemic is logical. But buying endless rolls of toilet paper?Some possible answers:“The thing about panic-buying is that it gives us a sense of control at a time when we’re lacking that,” says Deborah Small, a psychologist who studies consumer judgment and human decision-making at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. She adds that things get harried when “people hear that other people are buying something, and they say, ‘Oh, I need that too.’ And it just spirals to this level where we have none.”

* People compare and when everyone is doing it, they are more likely to do it too. It's the herd mentality.
* Some people don't know what they want until they see it in context. Everything is relative, and if there is relatively less toilet paper than say noodles and rice, the irrational side is more interested in toilet paper.
* To make people desire things, making that thing difficult to attain reduces the logical side. Toilet papers were literally out of stock, and attaining it is very difficult.

## 3 Themes

There are 3 themes to behavioural economics, heuristics, framing and market inefficiencies.**Heuristics**In Daniel Kahneman's book, thinking fast and slow, he introduced 2 thinking systems in our head. System 1 thinks fast. System 2 thinks slow. Humans are not only illogical, but we are also super lazy. You would rather watch more mindless Netflix than solve a very difficult mathematics problem.That's not all your fault, really. Our brains are lazy and we like to take shortcuts. We like to take the path of least resistance. We like the easy way. That's where System 1 comes in. System 1 learns from experience and it becomes a mental shortcut. Or a rule of thumb. You know how you can customise commands on Siri or Alexa? Same thing. Our brain does that. So we can conserve our energy when we need to think more.That's good right? Yeah, but no. We make 95% of our decisions with this shortcut tool, and the decisions does not consider other new information that is available.**Framing**The world is a very complicated place. Things are difficult to understand. How does internet work? How does emails work? What the hell is bitcoin? Why is the government doing what it is doing?Well, this is why we have anecdotes, stories and stereotypes. It is easier to understand complicated things when it is simplified. They also become a mental filter for us to rely on understanding.Think of Instagram filters. It is a set of fixed filters that is applied to our faces. But it doesn't always work! Sometimes, we end up with strange glitches. Our brains, being lazy, apply these filters. Sometimes, glitch happens. And we make illogical decisions.**Market Inefficiencies**So what about heuristics and framing? Ultimately, it creates market inefficiencies. What are market inefficiencies? Pricing things wrongly, making illogical decisions, etc.

## Why Study Behavioural Economics?

With economics, we like to predict things so we can make the best decisions. With classical economics, we assume that people are rational. Turns out, they are not. So with behavioural economics, we can predict people's irrationality that defy economic theory.

&gt;Basically, we can predict better now.

How? There are a few ways, but a major way is called Prospect Theory. We evaluate options based on alternatives.Let's say I tell you that I will give you 100 followers on your LinkedIn. The value of that 100 followers depends on how many followers you currently have. 100 is the absolutely value. But 100 can be a lot psychologically, depending on the reference point. For someone with 500 followers, and it is nothing for someone with 10,000 followers. We also experience different sensitivity to the changes in followers. Adding 100 when you start with 500 feels better than adding 100 when you start with 10,000 followers. And we do love having more followers, who value and appreciate the work we do!If you don't remember anything, just remember that decisions are reference dependence. We need references to evaluate outcomes. And people don't evaluate options equally. It depends on the changes, relative to the reference point in absolute value. People are happier when the difference is smaller than when the difference is too huge.For example, 100 followers added to an account with 500 followers vs 10,000 followers.

# Why are we like that? Why are we so prone to influence?

We have two levels of thinking. We have our rational mind that tells us, “No, I don’t need to buy another roll of toilet paper.” But we also have a more primitive, visceral, gut reaction that says, “Well, I better be safe than sorry. There will be no more toilet paper anymore.”The herd instinct can also kick in, where people suspend judgement and start doing what everyone else is doing. So, if everyone else is panic-buying supplies, people follow the herd.Heuristics influence our choices which are irrational and counter intuitive; we need help making better choices.We are prone to influence in 6 ways:

1. **Reciprocation:** when someone does a favour for you, you are more likely to return the favour some day. For example, in crisis like this, China sends their doctors to Italy to help with the pandemic. I am certain this act will be reciprocated by Italy to China some day down the future.
2. **Social Proof/Consensus:** If you are in the blockchain space, are you sick of the word consensus? Consensus just means something the mass agrees to. It is also a form of social proof, because if everyone agrees to it, it is likely to be right. For example, if the WHO and government of major countries think that the virus requires a lockdown and pause on the economy, other countries are likely to follow suite and agree that it is the right course of action. I'm not saying it is irrational to do so, I'm just saying we can be easily influenced by the action that most people agree to do.
3. **Authority**: I notice this early on in my life. I've been to many events and conferences, where just because the speaker is an older caucasian dude talking about things, people just believe him. And when I stand up to correct the information, it always starts with looks of ""who you think you are, young asian female."" But when coherent points and arguments are made, the audience starts to view me with more authority. We think with our fast thinking brain, called System 1. And we apply stereotypes that we previously had. It's fine though, I think, as long as one is open to changes and be aware of the fast thinking that we have.
4. **Liking**: Believe or not, people like beautiful looking people and people that are similar to us. Model \*\*\*\*selling us something will influence us to purchase it more than some random ugly person on the street. We also like people who are similar to us, because familiarity is something we all love. That's why nostalgia sells. We end up getting influenced easily this way.
5. **Scarcity**: We simply want something more just because we can't have it. Why is Bitcoin so sought after? There will only be 21M Bitcoin in existence. Is there a real purpose for Bitcoin other than being a digital asset for investment? Maybe. Who knows. We are influenced and so captivated by the idea of scarcity, and that you can own something that someone else doesn't have. Who is the best example of this? Supreme and everything that Supreme sells. They sell scarcity. And people are influenced to pay $100 for a brick.
6. **Commitment &amp; Consistency**: Lastly, consistency and commitment. We are more influenced by someone consistent in their message. For example, Bernie Sanders and his message during his lifetime career of being a politician. Or commitment by Sanders as he campaigns the same message all the time. We are more influenced by people who are committed and consistent.

None of these make logical sense, but hey, we are not always logical, right.

# How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics?

Firstly, it fits into Layer 2 of the economics design framework.Layer 1 is the system architecture. That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system. The framework is available as a research paper.Layer 1 is limited, because it is based on classical economics and assumes rationality of people. We've already learnt that that fails. So we need Layer 2.Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience. Think of user experience plus gamification.

## Gamified Systems

We can increase the probability of people's irrational actions through design. For example, I have 3 options:A: fruit basket for $15B: candy bars for $10C: fruit basket and candy bars for $15What would you get? Most probably option C.People rarely choose things in absolutely terms. We simply don't have an internal value meter for what things are worth. It is easier when the item is being compared, to get its internal value.**Example: exchange tokens.**Exchange tokens gather its value when traders get to pay in fiat, crypto or the native exchange tokens. When they get a better deal with the exchange tokens, they are more likely to want to get the tokens, instead of selling it in the secondary market. E.g. BNB token

## Nudge Theory

Nudge is a concept which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals. Basically, influencing people's ""independent"" actions towards the behaviour you want.It's kind of like Pavlov and his dogs. Ring the bell and the dog salivate. But it is more than just that. An example is Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport attaching an image of a housefly into the men's room urinals. Men would pee to aim at the housefly and cleanliness of the urinal went up. I guess men are not good at peeing.**Example: deflationary token**A simple example is deflationary tokens. Tokens have limited supply, and when demand soars, the price of tokens will increase. How can we nudge the demand? By reducing supply available like staking to be a validator or staking to earn interest on stakes. The behaviour you want is to reduce available supply, so as to increase prices. So you can influence the behaviour by having a better trade-off: earning interest on tokens staked.

## 6 Influence Methods

1. **Reciprocation:** By adding value first, before extracting value. For example, Crypto. com provides value-add like free netflix, free amazon prime and free spotify when you sign up with their cards.
2. **Social Proof/Consensus:** The simplest example would be Augur, the online betting platform. But that **is** their business model, so it doesn't count. Why is Bitcoin so valuable? Almost all crypto-people I know have assets in Bitcoin. The social proof is strong. When prices of Bitcoin fell on 16 Mar 2020, instead of liquidating more, social media was asking everyone to purchase more, since prices were so low. That consensus brought prices of BTC up again in 24h.
3. **Authority**: Authority comes from the background of the founders, their experience, educational background and street cred in the space. This is most evident in blockchain projects by academic professors like Silvio Micali, who founded Algorand.
4. **Liking**: I still find this funny, but in Asia, you see companies hiring pretty females to model for their crypto-projects. And according to plenty of my male friends in the space, these girls do a great job at influencing males to sign up for their projects.
5. **Scarcity**: We simply want something more just because we can't have it. Following Bitcoin's path of limited supply, every other project has a capped supply of tokens to induce scarcity.
6. **Commitment &amp; Consistency**: When Bitcoin's price fell on 16 Mar, the community was selling bitcoin hard on twitter and reddit. It's interesting because these people have quite some BTC in their portfolio, and they need to pump up the prices and continue the faith that BTC is worth something. Whatever it is, they are consistent in their message and truly committed in their shilling.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, many design of these crypto systems fail even with beautiful mathematical formula is that they miss out behavioral economics.Economics design of the crypto ecosystems are in 2 layers.Layer 1 is the system architecture. That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system. For example, matching algorithms, resolution mechanisms and monetary policy.Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience. That is user psychology plus gamification.If designing an ecosystem is like making creme brûlée, behavioural economics is using the blowtorch to caramalise the sugar to light golden brown. It's a very crucial and important step!

# 3 Discussion Takeaways Worth Pondering

1. Do you think designers need to abide by some regulations to ensure the morality of how systems are designed? It could go out of hand to influence people's decisions. This is evident in the countless of scams around.
2. Isn’t behavioral economics a depressing view of human nature?
3. How can we use good design for good purposes? For example, using nudge theory to encourage good behaviours. We collect data of someone's health status, and reward them with tokens when they attain certain healthy metrics. That's a positive use of nudge theory.",cryptocurrency,1645482869.0

What is Behavioural EconomicsBehavioural economics is a specific field of economics research. It studies the effects of social norms and individual psychology on economics decisions. In classical economics, we assume that everyone is logical. In behavioural economics, we study why people are illogical and why they behave like that.For example, buying a 2 weeks worth of food during a pandemic is logical. But buying endless rolls of toilet paper?Some possible answers:“The thing about panic-buying is that it gives us a sense of control at a time when we’re lacking that,” says Deborah Small, a psychologist who studies consumer judgment and human decision-making at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. She adds that things get harried when “people hear that other people are buying something, and they say, ‘Oh, I need that too.’ And it just spirals to this level where we have none.”

* People compare and when everyone is doing it, they are more likely to do it too. It's the herd mentality.
* Some people don't know what they want until they see it in context. Everything is relative, and if there is relatively less toilet paper than say noodles and rice, the irrational side is more interested in toilet paper.
* To make people desire things, making that thing difficult to attain reduces the logical side. Toilet papers were literally out of stock, and attaining it is very difficult.

## 3 Themes

There are 3 themes to behavioural economics, heuristics, framing and market inefficiencies.**Heuristics**In Daniel Kahneman's book, thinking fast and slow, he introduced 2 thinking systems in our head. System 1 thinks fast. System 2 thinks slow. Humans are not only illogical, but we are also super lazy. You would rather watch more mindless Netflix than solve a very difficult mathematics problem.That's not all your fault, really. Our brains are lazy and we like to take shortcuts. We like to take the path of least resistance. We like the easy way. That's where System 1 comes in. System 1 learns from experience and it becomes a mental shortcut. Or a rule of thumb. You know how you can customise commands on Siri or Alexa? Same thing. Our brain does that. So we can conserve our energy when we need to think more.That's good right? Yeah, but no. We make 95% of our decisions with this shortcut tool, and the decisions does not consider other new information that is available.**Framing**The world is a very complicated place. Things are difficult to understand. How does internet work? How does emails work? What the hell is bitcoin? Why is the government doing what it is doing?Well, this is why we have anecdotes, stories and stereotypes. It is easier to understand complicated things when it is simplified. They also become a mental filter for us to rely on understanding.Think of Instagram filters. It is a set of fixed filters that is applied to our faces. But it doesn't always work! Sometimes, we end up with strange glitches. Our brains, being lazy, apply these filters. Sometimes, glitch happens. And we make illogical decisions.**Market Inefficiencies**So what about heuristics and framing? Ultimately, it creates market inefficiencies. What are market inefficiencies? Pricing things wrongly, making illogical decisions, etc.

## Why Study Behavioural Economics?

With economics, we like to predict things so we can make the best decisions. With classical economics, we assume that people are rational. Turns out, they are not. So with behavioural economics, we can predict people's irrationality that defy economic theory.

&gt;Basically, we can predict better now.

How? There are a few ways, but a major way is called Prospect Theory. We evaluate options based on alternatives.Let's say I tell you that I will give you 100 followers on your LinkedIn. The value of that 100 followers depends on how many followers you currently have. 100 is the absolutely value. But 100 can be a lot psychologically, depending on the reference point. For someone with 500 followers, and it is nothing for someone with 10,000 followers. We also experience different sensitivity to the changes in followers. Adding 100 when you start with 500 feels better than adding 100 when you start with 10,000 followers. And we do love having more followers, who value and appreciate the work we do!If you don't remember anything, just remember that decisions are reference dependence. We need references to evaluate outcomes. And people don't evaluate options equally. It depends on the changes, relative to the reference point in absolute value. People are happier when the difference is smaller than when the difference is too huge.For example, 100 followers added to an account with 500 followers vs 10,000 followers.

# Why are we like that? Why are we so prone to influence?

We have two levels of thinking. We have our rational mind that tells us, “No, I don’t need to buy another roll of toilet paper.” But we also have a more primitive, visceral, gut reaction that says, “Well, I better be safe than sorry. There will be no more toilet paper anymore.”The herd instinct can also kick in, where people suspend judgement and start doing what everyone else is doing. So, if everyone else is panic-buying supplies, people follow the herd.Heuristics influence our choices which are irrational and counter intuitive; we need help making better choices.We are prone to influence in 6 ways:

1. **Reciprocation:** when someone does a favour for you, you are more likely to return the favour some day. For example, in crisis like this, China sends their doctors to Italy to help with the pandemic. I am certain this act will be reciprocated by Italy to China some day down the future.
2. **Social Proof/Consensus:** If you are in the blockchain space, are you sick of the word consensus? Consensus just means something the mass agrees to. It is also a form of social proof, because if everyone agrees to it, it is likely to be right. For example, if the WHO and government of major countries think that the virus requires a lockdown and pause on the economy, other countries are likely to follow suite and agree that it is the right course of action. I'm not saying it is irrational to do so, I'm just saying we can be easily influenced by the action that most people agree to do.
3. **Authority**: I notice this early on in my life. I've been to many events and conferences, where just because the speaker is an older caucasian dude talking about things, people just believe him. And when I stand up to correct the information, it always starts with looks of ""who you think you are, young asian female."" But when coherent points and arguments are made, the audience starts to view me with more authority. We think with our fast thinking brain, called System 1. And we apply stereotypes that we previously had. It's fine though, I think, as long as one is open to changes and be aware of the fast thinking that we have.
4. **Liking**: Believe or not, people like beautiful looking people and people that are similar to us. Model \*\*\*\*selling us something will influence us to purchase it more than some random ugly person on the street. We also like people who are similar to us, because familiarity is something we all love. That's why nostalgia sells. We end up getting influenced easily this way.
5. **Scarcity**: We simply want something more just because we can't have it. Why is Bitcoin so sought after? There will only be 21M Bitcoin in existence. Is there a real purpose for Bitcoin other than being a digital asset for investment? Maybe. Who knows. We are influenced and so captivated by the idea of scarcity, and that you can own something that someone else doesn't have. Who is the best example of this? Supreme and everything that Supreme sells. They sell scarcity. And people are influenced to pay $100 for a brick.
6. **Commitment &amp; Consistency**: Lastly, consistency and commitment. We are more influenced by someone consistent in their message. For example, Bernie Sanders and his message during his lifetime career of being a politician. Or commitment by Sanders as he campaigns the same message all the time. We are more influenced by people who are committed and consistent.

None of these make logical sense, but hey, we are not always logical, right.

# How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics?

Firstly, it fits into Layer 2 of the economics design framework.Layer 1 is the system architecture. That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system. The framework is available as a research paper.Layer 1 is limited, because it is based on classical economics and assumes rationality of people. We've already learnt that that fails. So we need Layer 2.Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience. Think of user experience plus gamification.

## Gamified Systems

We can increase the probability of people's irrational actions through design. For example, I have 3 options:A: fruit basket for $15B: candy bars for $10C: fruit basket and candy bars for $15What would you get? Most probably option C.People rarely choose things in absolutely terms. We simply don't have an internal value meter for what things are worth. It is easier when the item is being compared, to get its internal value.**Example: exchange tokens.**Exchange tokens gather its value when traders get to pay in fiat, crypto or the native exchange tokens. When they get a better deal with the exchange tokens, they are more likely to want to get the tokens, instead of selling it in the secondary market. E.g. BNB token

## Nudge Theory

Nudge is a concept which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals. Basically, influencing people's ""independent"" actions towards the behaviour you want.It's kind of like Pavlov and his dogs. Ring the bell and the dog salivate. But it is more than just that. An example is Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport attaching an image of a housefly into the men's room urinals. Men would pee to aim at the housefly and cleanliness of the urinal went up. I guess men are not good at peeing.**Example: deflationary token**A simple example is deflationary tokens. Tokens have limited supply, and when demand soars, the price of tokens will increase. How can we nudge the demand? By reducing supply available like staking to be a validator or staking to earn interest on stakes. The behaviour you want is to reduce available supply, so as to increase prices. So you can influence the behaviour by having a better trade-off: earning interest on tokens staked.

## 6 Influence Methods

1. **Reciprocation:** By adding value first, before extracting value. For example, Crypto. com provides value-add like free netflix, free amazon prime and free spotify when you sign up with their cards.
2. **Social Proof/Consensus:** The simplest example would be Augur, the online betting platform. But that **is** their business model, so it doesn't count. Why is Bitcoin so valuable? Almost all crypto-people I know have assets in Bitcoin. The social proof is strong. When prices of Bitcoin fell on 16 Mar 2020, instead of liquidating more, social media was asking everyone to purchase more, since prices were so low. That consensus brought prices of BTC up again in 24h.
3. **Authority**: Authority comes from the background of the founders, their experience, educational background and street cred in the space. This is most evident in blockchain projects by academic professors like Silvio Micali, who founded Algorand.
4. **Liking**: I still find this funny, but in Asia, you see companies hiring pretty females to model for their crypto-projects. And according to plenty of my male friends in the space, these girls do a great job at influencing males to sign up for their projects.
5. **Scarcity**: We simply want something more just because we can't have it. Following Bitcoin's path of limited supply, every other project has a capped supply of tokens to induce scarcity.
6. **Commitment &amp; Consistency**: When Bitcoin's price fell on 16 Mar, the community was selling bitcoin hard on twitter and reddit. It's interesting because these people have quite some BTC in their portfolio, and they need to pump up the prices and continue the faith that BTC is worth something. Whatever it is, they are consistent in their message and truly committed in their shilling.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, many design of these crypto systems fail even with beautiful mathematical formula is that they miss out behavioral economics.Economics design of the crypto ecosystems are in 2 layers.Layer 1 is the system architecture. That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system. For example, matching algorithms, resolution mechanisms and monetary policy.Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience. That is user psychology plus gamification.If designing an ecosystem is like making creme brûlée, behavioural economics is using the blowtorch to caramalise the sugar to light golden brown. It's a very crucial and important step!

# 3 Discussion Takeaways Worth Pondering

1. Do you think designers need to abide by some regulations to ensure the morality of how systems are designed? It could go out of hand to influence people's decisions. This is evident in the countless of scams around.
2. Isn’t behavioral economics a depressing view of human nature?
3. How can we use good design for good purposes? For example, using nudge theory to encourage good behaviours. We collect data of someone's health status, and reward them with tokens when they attain certain healthy metrics. That's a positive use of nudge theory.",cryptocurrency,1645482895.0

Private Student loans are at 24k right now. 3.4% interest rate.

Also, I feel that if I ever get into trouble, I can use the car and sell and then I will have no loans if I pay off my student loans first. 

I am very conflicted. Please help!

stocks,A History of Bill Ackman's Best Defensive Hedge Trades,"Hedging is a risk management strategy employed to offset losses by taking an opposite position in a related asset. Typically, hedging strategies will employ some form of derivative financial instruments, such as options or futures contracts. During turbulent times in the market such as the one we are in today, hedging can be one of the best ways to protect your portfolio.

Effective hedging, however, is not easy. Hedging does reduce downside exposure, but it also comes at the risk of limiting upside potential. There is also an inherent risk in hedging for investors who don’t understand the financial instruments involved in the process.

So to get a better understanding of how to effectively hedge downside risk, we decided to do a deep dive into Pershing Square’s track record with defensive hedging. Over the years, Ackman’s hedge fund has made some incredibly successful and lucrative downside bets that have increased investor returns. We wanted to get an idea of Ackman’s hedging strategy, as well as the financial instruments he utilized in each of them.

Hedging Bet #1

*Time Period: 2005 - 2009 (CDS Hedge)*

*Investment Cost: $64 million*

*Total Proceeds: $1.2 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 18.5x*

*Financial Instrument Used: CDS on Bond Issuers (mostly MBIA)*

In 2002, Bill Ackman published a report underlining his short thesis on Municipal Bond insurer MBIA. The report, which was titled “[Is MBIA Triple A?](http://www.briem.com/files/Ackman_MBIA_12092002.pdf)”, provided details on the enormous leverage that was hidden inside MBIA and its subsidiary MBIA Insurance Corp.

Ackman’s short thesis was based on the following factors:

* Municipal Bond Insurance is not a lucrative business model, given that muni-bonds generally have guarantees from the state. Even then, insurance is generally used to lower the interest rate on these bonds. As a result, these insurance premiums were eating into the public money
* MBIA’s accounting was fraudulent and didn’t reflect the risk factors, particularly tied to leverage
* The structured finance products of MBIA were suspect. MBIA aimed to guarantee AAA-rated CDOs, but Wall Street and MBIA was manufacturing these ratings
* The loss of AAA rating would significantly impact MBIA’s ability to remain solvent

Not surprisingly, the report was met with resistance and doubts from all over Wall Street. Before the report was even published, MBIA’s Chairman and CEO Joseph Brown privately met with Ackman. This is what he had to say:

&gt;“You’re a young guy, early in your career. You should think long and hard before issuing the report. We are the largest guarantor of New York state and New York City bonds. In fact, we’re the largest guarantor of municipal debt in the country. Let’s put it this way: We have friends in high places.”

Ackman didn’t step down. He hired a top forensic accounting expert and brought evidence of MBIA’s fraudulent accounting several times to Moody’s. In 2005, Ackman wrote a letter to Moody’s Board of Directors which read:

&gt;“Moody’s AAA rating is so powerful and credible that investors don’t do any due diligence on the underlying credit. Every day that Moody’s incorrectly maintains an AAA rating on MBIA, these extremely risk-averse investors unwittingly buy bonds that are not deserving of Moody’s AAA rating.”

In addition to shorting the stock of MBIA, Ackman also purchased CDS, or Credit Default Swaps on MBIA’s debt. These swaps act as insurance in the case of credit events or solvency risks that the issuer of the debt may face. In exchange, the buyer is forced to pay annual premiums to the seller.

The premiums that Ackman paid on his MBIA CDS position put a massive drag on his overall returns for many years. Finally, in February of 2008, MBIA cut its dividend and suspended its structured finance activities. In June of the same year, MBIA and Ambac, the two largest municipal bond insurers, lost their AAA rating from Moody’s, and Ackman walked away with $1.2 billion of proceeds from the trade.\*

This particular bet showed Ackman’s conviction in his position, despite having dealt with criticism and drag on returns for many years. As Whitney Wilson, Co-Manager of T2 Partners, put it:

&gt;“For five years he was wrong, wrong, wrong. Then he made billions… He is the most relentlessly stubborn person on the planet.”

Hedging Bet #2

*Time Period: 2020*

*Investment Cost: $27 million*

*Total Proceeds: $2.6 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 96.3x*

*Financial Instrument Used: Index CDS on Investment Grade and High Yield Bonds*

After a few years of underperformance relative to the S&amp;P due to positions such as Herbalife and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Bill Ackman entered the financial limelight once again in 2020.

In February of 2020, Ackman began to worry about a pandemic-related economic recession. His hedge fund bought insurance policy through CDS on almost $71 billion worth of corporate debt, including $44.5 billion of U.S investment-grade bonds, $23.1 billion of an equivalent European index, and a $3.1 billion notional exposure to Europe’s high yield debt.

This bet was risky, to say the least, and required an enormous level of conviction due to the volatility it imposed on the fund’s portfolio. At its peak, this one position accounted for almost 40% of Pershing Square’s entire AUM. On March 13, when the S&amp;P jumped 10%, the value of the contracts had dropped by $800 million in just one day.

By the time Ackman appeared on CNBC on March 18, he had sold about half of the defensive hedge position. He then went on to use the proceeds to buy into many of his existing positions, while also adding a new position in the coffee chain Starbucks. As of March 31, Pershing Square had not only offset all the losses on their long-equity positions but had actually ended the quarter with substantial gains relative to the S&amp;P

One of the underappreciated aspects that allowed Ackman to pursue such a bold strategy lies in the unique structure of his hedge fund. In 2014, Pershing Square publicly-listed itself on the Euronext Amsterdam - the Netherlands stock market. So while a lot of hedge funds were facing capital calls from investors during the pandemic-related scare, Ackman had the resource of permanent capital. It is safe to say that he made good use of this opportunity.

Hedging Bet #3

*Time Period: Late 2020 - 2022 (Ongoing)*

*Investment Cost: $188 million*

*Total Proceeds: $1.4 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 7.4x*

*Financial Instrument Used: OTM 2Yr and 10Yr Swaptions*

Towards the end of 2020, Pershing Square came to the conclusion that interest rates would substantially rise throughout the next few years. The thesis for this position was fueled by the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve and the U.S government.

As of December 2020, the unemployment rate was nearly 6.7% with CPI inflation at 1.4%. Due to QE and stimulus, Ackman was expecting both metrics to take substantial turns for the rest of 2021. By the end of 2021, this prediction turned out to be right, with unemployment falling to 3.9% as of December 2021 and CPI inflation ramping up to almost 7.0%.

To hedge against interest rate risk, Pershing Square purchased out-of-the-money interest rate swaptions starting towards the end of 2020. In January of 2021, they sold nearly 90% of the market value of the position, generating about $1.25 billion in proceeds. Since then, they have replaced this hedge with an additional longer-dated out-of-the-money swaption.

Swaptions, which stand for swap options, is a type of options contract which gives the buyer the right to enter into a swap contract on a specified date. These options are generally purchased in the over-the-counter market and are not traded on an exchange. This requires both the buyer and the seller to mutually agree on the notional amount, time period, and the fixed/floating rates involved with the instrument.

Swaptions come in two forms: payer swaptions and receiver swaptions. The payer swaption gives you the right to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate of interest, usually the LIBOR rate. On the other hand, a receiver swaption is exactly the opposite.

To use an example, a borrower with loans maturing sometime within the next year might want to purchase payer swaptions to hedge against any substantial interest rate movement. If the variable interest rate, which is tied to LIBOR, moves above the fixed interest rate that was agreed upon, then the borrower would want to exercise the contract to pay the fixed rate instead.

Takeaways and Lessons

From studying Bill Ackman and Pershing Square’s track record of defensive hedging, there were 3 main lessons that we walked away with:

1. Only take bets in which you have large convictions. The market will often remain irrational longer than you would expect, or longer than you can remain solvent in many cases.
2. Look for bets with asymmetric payouts. This means limited upfront carrying costs and investments with opportunities to generate large multiples on your capital. This also means investments with a limited downside in cases where the potential risk does not transpire
3. Hedging is more lucrative on a short-term basis where the monetization of it can become a funding source for cheap equities during downturns. Continuous hedging strategies do work, but they will often put a drag on overall returns.",finance,1645499180.0

personalfinance,ELI5: Safe harbor for estimated payments of capital gains,"This year I sold some stock, and I have capital gains.  I estimate I'll have to pay $10k in federal taxes.  My understanding is as follows:

1. I need to pay $10k by April 18 of this year
2. I can pay four equal amounts of $2.5k in April, June, Sept, and Jan 2023.
3. I can pay $10k in April 2023 without underpayment penalty, if I meet the ""safe harbor"" criteria.

I don't quite seem to understand what the ""safe harbor"" criteria means.  From the 2022 1040ES:

1. You expect to owe at least $1,000 in tax for 2022,after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits.
2. You expect your withholding and refundable credits to be less than the smaller of:

&gt;a. 90% of the tax to be shown on your 2022 tax return, or  
&gt;  
&gt;b. ~~100%~~ 110% \[My 2021 AGI was &gt; $150k\] of the tax shown on your 2021 tax return.Your 2021 tax return must cover all 12 months.

\#1 makes sense.  I estimate I need to pay $10k additional taxes from the capital gains.

\#2a kind of makes sense.  If I expect that my withholding for this year to only cover 90% of what I expect to pay in taxes for this year, then I should make estimated payments.

\#2b I just don't get.  Say that my salary was similar between 2021 and 2022, except for a raise.  Then I would expect my withholding to be greater than 110% of the taxes I paid last year.  This has nothing to do with the $10k in capital gain's tax.  Does that mean that I met the safe harbor criteria, and I don't have to make estimated payments?",finance,1645501634.0
Bitcoin,My Thoughts on Crypto,"Facts:  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase were heavy into subprime mortgage securities because they were the investment of the moment in 2007.

Financial engineering always ends up with a lot folks holding the bag. Hedge funds and large investments banks cover themselves on both sides moving values back and forth. One should be concerned when they don’t know how or why an asset increases or decreases in value. Traditional fiat money changes in value due to factors such as interest rates, gross domestic product (the true indicator of any economy) and political environment. We’re really not sure what makes cryptocurrencies fluctuate in value.

personalfinance,Unpaid tuition debt seems to have vanished.,"Hello everyone and thanks for the help in advance. 

Back in 2016 I was attending my second semester at a University in Oregon and didn’t file my FAFSA in time and therefore had ~$10,000 owed to the school out of pocket. I didn’t have the money to pay it so they eventually forwarded the debt to the Oregon Department of Revenue for collections. 
I set up a payment plan with them but the interest rate alone was $100 per month so paying it off that way just wasn’t possible. I continued making payments monthly anyway until Covid hit. 
So my last payment was around March/April of 2020 and I haven’t heard from the department of revenue about it at all. I owed slightly over $9,000 at that time. Last night I logged into my account with them and my balance now says $0. They did just take my state tax return and apply it to the account though so I’m a little confused as to why my balance would say $0 all of the sudden.

The TLDR being: inflation was going to run hotter than expected, bond yields would move up, stocks would have to come down, growth stocks would get destroyed and the fed wouldn’t be able to come to the rescue because inflation tied their hands. I suggested value, shorting bond yields and buying internationally. I predicted this would start soon and accelerate early-mid 2022.

I named this upcoming event “**The Great Wheeze**” - a slow slump based on liquidity exiting.

The response back then was this was crazy talk. Inflation was seen as mostly transitory, it’d peak at 5ish%. Markets were pricing in a couple of hikes (now it's 7 this year). Stocks went on a big Santa rally, value was cheap, NASDAQ was firing on all cylinders.

First let’s have a look at some of the friendly things people had to say 5 months ago:

&gt;I wonder during how many bubbles throughout history has this theory has been suggested and has it ever once played out?  
&gt;  
&gt;Ivy league economists: ""yeah we really don't know. Its impossible to predict a timeline for such things with any degree of accuracy. Here is a 500 page peer reviewed book to prove our points."" Dude on reddit: "" I've figured it out! T minus 12 months. Guaranteed. Here is 2 paragraphs of garbage to prove my point.""  
&gt;  
&gt;You have no idea what you're talking about and are probably watching too many YouTube videos. I don't know what I'm talking about either, so let's both shut up.  
&gt;  
&gt;What an absolute joke of a post. You don’t even understand basic yield formulas.  
&gt;  
&gt;To everyone else, steer clear of anyone who claims ""certainties"" like this, **ALWAYS**. This guy is leaving out many variables which cannot possibly be predicted and is grossly over-simplifying something as complex as a year+ forecast.  
&gt;  
&gt;High inflation will not happen. The Fed doesn’t control it and its appearance is absolutely not a certainty ; that is what the market is seeing and you’re not.  
&gt;  
&gt;The inflation we are seeing now is purely aggregate demand based, mostly due to high demand and supply chain issues and shortages and the tell tale sign of this is unequal increases

**The economy is not strong** like Powell, Biden and much of the media crowd say. Blowout deficits and QE have temporarily plastered over underlying weakness.

**Inflation will peak shortly**, but will stabilise higher than pre-COVID (4-5%) for an extended period of time (years). Interest rates will still be negative in real terms and so much cash is floating out there. Central banks will have to be more hawkish going forward, so if the market crashes they'll do less.

At the end of the day the Fed and other central banks are in a bind. They won’t be able to increase interest rates above 3-4% to actually fight it. Even if they could, it’d cause a recession.

**So the only solution is for developed markets is to devalue their currency.** This means extended inflation in developed markets, strengthening emerging market currencies. The era of exporting our inflation to the USD hungry 3rd world is over. [You can already see EM currencies starting to edge up](https://au.investing.com/indices/msci-intl-em-currency).

\----------------

How to play it?

First, **Russia won’t invade Ukraine**, Putin will consolidate his holdings in the rebel regions but won’t go as far as to get hit with real sanctions. A lot of fuss and then things die down. Russian stocks are getting crushed, this is probably close to the absolute bottom so load up on $RSX. Hold for 6 months and make 30%, $RUSL will do better.

With declining multiples and weak customers almost all assets are going to suffer. I think it’s going to be very difficult for the next couple years to do well in anything.

If a 30 PE company growing at 10%/year falls to a 20 PE; it will take 5 years to grow back to even. Rapid growth can negate multiple compression if your entry point is attractive enough.

Growth is going to get oversold, but be careful of what type of growth you buy as most will still struggle. Growth is the answer not value.

Emerging markets are the place to find small, fast growing companies at low valuations. As the inequalities between rich and poor nations are arbitraged away it is a certainty that EM will outperform developed significantly in the long run. Developed markets have mistaken multiple expansion for strength.

Emerging market, smallcap growth in sectors insulated from weaker developed consumption is the sweet spot. Buy in the next 6 months. Look outside China. India, Vietnam, Egypt are all good. India probably the safest but most expensive.",finance,1645511272.0
personalfinance,I-bonds questions and cashing them,"Question about cashing in an i-bond.  I know the rate Is released on a 6 month basis And you need to hold it 1 year.  If you cash it in before the maturity you pay an interest penalty, is the penalty based on the prevailing rate or the earned interest rate?

Example if I purchased the i-bonds and it paid the 7.12% but during the next 6 months inflation came down and the Ibonds went back to say .5% after 12 months when I turned them in would I be paying 3 months interest at .5% Or average of what I made",finance,1645512555.0
gaming,Elden Ring - Class choice for newbies,"I only ever played DS1 (for about half the game) and a bit of DS2 (fed up  with the difficulty and left it). But i think it's about time i play a harder/more challenging game after years of playing solo games on Nightmare modes (Dragon Age Inquisition, Dragon's Dogma, AC:Odyssey etc). 

I have no idea how combat and stats work. And that is a problem since i am a number cruncher/min maxer. I liked the idea of choosing wretch but i learned it doesn actually mean you put your stat points wherever you want, it means you start with your points evenly on each stat (which is not optimal on end game builds). I do not not strictly prefer a melee or a ranged/mage approach on games, usually i play whatever feels natural to play on each game. For example i loved assassin in Dragon Age Inquisition and also loved magick archer in Dragon's Dogma.

personalfinance,Car dealership ripoff?,"My wife has been looking at new cars. I know, I know - we usually buy used and run them into the ground. But last year I got a new job, we moved to a new state for the 5th time in 14 years, and she's been absolutely amazing about supporting my career ambitions. We're in a spot where we can afford to do it, and she's never had a brand new car before. Even when I offered essentially a blank check to pick out whatever she wants, she went with the Ford Edge. Marry someone who values practicality, kids.

So anyway, on to the personal finance part. After talking about it quite a bit, we decided that we would lease. She found exactly the car she wanted, we went to the dealership last night. Sticker on the car was $44K. After doing some research online, I knew our trade should be worth $12K-$15K. They offered me $10K for the trade-in. Fine, I know they're trying to make money, and this isn't about that.

They were honest about the dealer markup being $3k, just outright. That took the price up to $47K. I wasn't thrilled about that, but was willing to bite the bullet and overpay. Then they came out with the $X/month for 36 months, and I just couldn't make the math work. Like - mathematically, it just didn't balance.

I made sure I understood the residual value, I asked about the money factor (and calculated it into interest rate), I confirmed the 'money down' credit for the trade in, I was off by about $5K. I just couldn't find it. The salesman gave way to the finance guy, to then the sales manager, to then the dealership general manager. They all assured me repeatedly that Ford sets the numbers, this math is correct. It's down to the penny correct, and that my math must be wrong.

Finally, as they shuffled through their papers trying to get us to sign, I saw the breakdown numbers. They were financing $44k, with $0 down. I asked about that, and they said that's just how the lease works.

Anyway, as best I understand it - they marked up the car by $3K, then wanted to take and additional $5K in straight profit for the dealership, and only log the deal at $44K. We walked, but the more I've thought about it - they were trying to just get $8K in profit on this deal (aside from whatever they'd get on the back end), right? They tried to sell me a $44K car for $52K? Or am I missing something here?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: the lease was $438/mo for 36 months, with 54% residual and 2.95% ARP (I don't recall what that breaks down to in money factor, but did the math last night and confirmed it). With $12K down, that seemed higher than I thought it should be. I considered just buying it outright, but had a bad taste in my mouth last night. We're going to take a day or two to discuss, and if we don't get this car there will be plenty of others. Even if she has to wait a little bit.",finance,1645536410.0
stocks,(2/22) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"# Good Tuesday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the first trading day of this week and a frrrrrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, February 22nd, 2022-

*****

# [Dow futures down slightly after erasing earlier losses amid Russia-Ukraine tensions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell slightly Tuesday morning, reversing much sharper declines earlier, as traders monitor brewing tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down by 60 points or 0.17%. S&amp;P 500 futures were off just 0.05%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.5%. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday due to the President’s Day holiday.
*****
&gt; All of the declines were well off their overnight lows that saw Dow futures down more than 500 points.
*****
&gt; Oil prices rose, with West Texas Intermediate futures jumping 4.5% to $95.19 per barrel.
*****
&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he would recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine, potentially undercutting peace talks with President Joe Biden. That announcement was followed by news that Biden was set to order sanctions on separatist regions of Ukraine, with the European Union vowing to take additional measures.
*****
&gt; Putin later ordered forces into the two breakaway regions.
*****
&gt; U.K. Health Minister Sajid Javid said Tuesday that “the invasion of Ukraine has begun.” U.S. President Joe Biden has not yet used the word “invasion” to describe the current activity. The nation has also started targeted economic sanctions against five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals.
*****
&gt; The news came after the White House said Sunday that Biden has accepted “in principle” to meet with Putin in yet another effort to deescalate the Russia-Ukraine situation via diplomacy. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the summit between the two leaders would occur after a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov.
*****
&gt; The Russia-Ukraine conflict has put pressure on market sentiment recently, with the major averages posting back-to-back weekly losses. The Dow fell 1.9% last week, and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively.
*****
&gt; “While Monday’s episode will have important implications for Russia’s political relations with foreign partners, a significant market event is likely avoided for the time being, but the trajectory in the coming weeks will be important to monitor from a rising market risk perspective,” said Ed Mills of Raymond James.
*****
&gt; In early earnings action, Home Depot reported quarterly profit of $3.21 a share, three cents better than estimates, and said it sees earnings and revenue growth this year. Shares rose 1.4% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Macy’s popped more than 7% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Macy’s also authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program and announced a 5% dividend increase
*****
&gt; In deal news, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt shares surged 14.4% after the company said it would be taken private by Veritas Capital in a deal worth $21 a share, representing a nearly 16% premium from Friday’s close. The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; Traders are also keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve, as the U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates multiple times starting next month. Traders are betting that there is a 100% chance of a Fed rate hike after the March 15-16 meeting, with expectations tilting toward a 0.25 percentage point move, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; Expectations of tighter monetary policy have put pressure on stocks, particularly those in rate-sensitive sectors like tech, and have sent Treasury yield sharply higher to start 2022. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield ended last week around 1.93% after briefly breaking above 2%. The 10-year began 2022 trading at around 1.51%.
*****
&gt; “All eyes are on the Fed,” Strategas investment strategist Ryan Grabinski wrote in a note released Friday evening. “As of today, the market is expecting the Fed to raise interest rates at nearly every meeting this year. Despite that, we left Monetary Policy as Favorable for now because the Fed is continuing to purchase Treasuries (an accommodative policy action).”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Wall Street is preparing for the tail-end of the corporate earnings season, with Home Depot and eBay among the companies set to report this week. It has been a solid earnings season thus far: Of the more than 400 S&amp;P 500 companies that have posted fourth-quarter earnings, 77.7% have beaten analyst expectations, according to FactSet.

CryptoCurrency,Privacy in Crypto: Is Monero Still Top Dog?,"**TL;DR** – No matter why you want privacy (its your right anyways) there are multiple good options in crypto space. Monero (XMR) is still top dog, but there are several other great options with a little different spin on privacy. Personally I like what Secret Network (SCRT) is doing. 

With the whole Canada debacle, privacy has once again taken a lot of spotlight (ironic I know). How do we protect our data and transactions in a world where Fuckbook and Google want all our data? Contrary to some peoples beliefs (though it seems many are knowledgeable on this), majority of cryptos aren’t naturally private. Bitcoin doesn’t hide your transactions, and in-fact, it’s the exact opposite and very easy to track transactions on the blockchain. With that being said, there are some cryptos out there with a focus on privacy. With that being said, I wanted to take a look at a few of these different privacy protocols and see who is the top dog

* **Monero (XMR) –** XMR is probably the most famous privacy coin and most popular. Untraceable. Even the feds can’t figure out this one and offer bounties for anyone who can crack the code. All transactions using Monero are private. This hides where the money comes from, hides the amount, and hides where the money goes. End to end its all private. Even if someone knows your wallet address to send you money, they can’t see any details on transaction history from your wallet. A big downside to this level of privacy is some exchanges have banned Monero. 
* **Secret Network (SCRT)** – Secret Network is part of the Cosmos Ecosystem. This coin is adding privacy to more than just sending and receiving a coin, it is adding privacy to smart contracts and NFTs. The SCRT coin is used to pay gas fees to mint secretSCRT or secret wrapped coins from various blockchains (COSMOS, Binance, PolkaDOT, or Ethereum). While someone will be able to see how much you put in and take out, everything in between will be private. Some speculate this will help Secret Network be exchange listable.  This is huge for those wanting private smart contracts or private NFTs. The Secret Network is ever evolving too adding new features and upgrades. Their selling point is Ethereums Smart Contract Features + Moneros Privacy + Cosmos Scalability and Interoperability = Secret Network. 
* **Litecoin (LTC) –** LTC has recently rolled out an opt-in privacy feature using the mimblewimble protocol. So its not private unless you choose for it to be. The intent of this opt-in feature was to be more exchange friendly. LTC using mimblewimble is not as private as Monero, but it should be more scalable. Its an interesting development from one of the OG coins out there. Whether or not it will be utilized by the masses will yet to be seen, but is interesting non the less that LTC has chosen to add in privacy. 
* **Oasis (ROSE) –** Oasis plans to bring privacy to smart contracts. They take a unique approach by splitting the consensus and execution layers to bring scalability and fast speed to privacy. In addition to smart contracts they allow you to tokenize your data and store it so it is private data on the blockchain. They even have an interesting set of partners/integrators such as BMW, Binance, and Chainlink. 

Some other privacy cryptos to consider are: Zcash (ZEC), Decred (DCR), Horizen (ZEN), Haven Protocol (XHV), Tornado Cash (TORN), and Beam (BEAM).

Let me know if there are any other privacy coins out there that are worth taking a look at. What is your favorite to use or what are you most excited to try?

Thank you.",cryptocurrency,1645543595.0

personalfinance,How is federal income taxed on a specific pay stub with a variable income?,"Hello. This isn't necessarily a question about brackets as I understand how they work. This is a question about how those brackets are applied throughout the year. I am trying to refine my spreadsheet to filter all my imported pay stubs and automate the federal income tax cell. I think I'm getting confused about what income data they are basing my bracket on: is it just an estimation based on my current paycheck, an estimation based on all my paychecks this year, etc.?

So I am in the 22% bracket covering only about $6000 of my paycheck. I am not interested in how much my year end taxes paid will be, but rather what my taxes on a specific paystub will be. Here's the formula I've been using and it's always a few dollars off: 

Fed Income Tax per Pay = $179.38 + 22%\*(Gross-reimbursements-deductions-FICA-State income-$1558.69)

Where I got those #:

$179.38 = (Total taxes paid 10-12% / 26) = $4807.50  26

22% = Current bracket

$1558.69 = Bracket floor / 26 = $41776 / 26",finance,1645545557.0
CryptoCurrency,Crypto is still a hedge against inflation,"I have seen a number of people saying that crypto isn't a hedge against inflation as Bitcoin is falling when there is high inflation. I think this argument is wrong.

In 2020 and 2021, the Fed pumped in a huge amount of money into the economy and lowered interest rates. Everyone saw this as a cause of future inflation. Bitcoin went from $5k to $60k, i.e. 12x.

Bitcoin was increasing against inflation then. I.e. it was a hedge before the inflation occurred, otherwise known as a leading indicator.

Now the inflation is actually occurring, and the Fed is raising rates and tapering asset purchases, Bitcoin is falling. This is because the inflation is being controlled.

Bitcoin has still 5x since 2020. It has still covered the cost of inflation many times over and people forget that.

The pay has always been pretty shit (minimum wage) so i was thinking about leaving in 2020. Then the pandemic hit so i decided to stay to keep a stable income since i was still content.

Recently (3 months ago) i realized how severely underpaid i was, They were still paying me the previous year's minimum wage (below today's minimum wage but fixed now).  Whilst others in my industry were making £20,000 minimum starting salary and im here on £14000. I do most of the 1st &amp; 2nd line IT support tasks, I help with creating users guides and testing updates for our mobile apps and online software. Im pretty much a swiss army tech but i dont feel like im being truly valued. Another example would be that my manager has been off sick for a few weeks and i am once again capable of handling all the support in his absence and all i get is a ""good job"". 

If i left i would pretty much leave the company IT support entirely understaffed and would probably stress out my manager which i wouldn't like to do. I have mentioned i want a raise, they made me do a self appraisal but i haven't heard anything in over a month. What should i do now. I also have 20 days of unused leave since i havent really been up to much, I was planning to get paid for 12 of those and take long holiday in april.

robotics,PID controller - How to calculate cross-track error using wheel encoder,"I've simulated a simple four-wheeled rover with mecanum wheels. For now, let's say the rover only needs to move forwards, the problem is that the rover doesn't go straight, but instead veers off to the left or right, even though I've given an equal rotational velocity to all of the four wheels.

There is no GPS or IMU, so there is no direct way to know the position of the robot at a given time, so I don't think it is possible to directly calculate the cross-track error. The only sensors that are usable are the wheel encoders that give the total angle rotated by each wheel joint at that point in time. 

The approach I'm trying to use for my PID controller is as follows -

PV =  \[(total angle rotated by Top Right wheel + Bottom Right wheel) - (Total angle rotated by Top Left wheel + Bottom Left wheel)\]

Error = 0 - PV

The output of the controller is then fed into the left/right velocity of the rover. If the rover is veering to the left, the right wheels will have rotated more than the left wheels, so the PV will be positive, a correctional leftwards velocity (output of the controller) is given to the rover to fix this, vice versa if it veers to the right, and if it is centered, then the error will be 0. The rover simultaneously moves forwards with the given velocity as well as left/right with the correctional velocity because of the mecanum wheels.

But there are a lot of problems with this method, and I haven't really been able to find any other ways to do it online. Please tell me if I'm missing something, I would really appreciate any insights.",technology,1645550601.0

CryptoMarkets,Blockchain Use Cases: A Focus on Microlending,"While blockchain technology is commonly considered potentially disruptive in various regards, most especially because of the massive energy consumption brought about by some of its core processes (Proof of Work), there has been tremendous innovation brought about by this notorious technology.

 This post focuses on the improvements it has brought into the world of microfinancing, particularly microfinance. Microloans as we know are small loans with little or no interest given by retail banks, MFBs, and NGOs to the less privileged members of society as a means to alleviate poverty. While the concept of microlending is altruistic in nature, these generous institutions would like to make some profit nonetheless or at the very least not run at losses.

 Studies have revealed that the cost of processing, storing, and transferring the data that these institutions leverage to make important decisions are quite expensive in a centralized system. This is due to the presence of the middle man in the workflow of the data processing, storage, and transfer. These institutions can balance out this cost by charging high-interest rates on microloans, however, this goes against the very essence of microloans.

 Blockchain solves this problem through decentralization, essentially, eliminating the need for middle man validation. This has brought about the establishment of platforms on the blockchain ecosystem with the ability to process, store and transfer the data necessary for the facilitation of microloans.

I agree with most of the comments that mentioned that is bad time to buy and that buying a new car is not a smart financial decision (in a normal market). But I will like to share a different point of view:

Doing a quick research, some specialist expect this could take 1 to 3 years to the markets stabilize, so that means at to start getting promotions will take longer. I'm reviewing the MSRP of multiple cars over time and normally they increase the price each year based in inflation and other factors. 

The inflation has being very low for the last 8 years pre-covid, so the price on the cars were increase around 3-4% each year (depending on model, brand, etc.). This means that it will be very likely to increase the price for next year or later this year.

Assuming a price increase of 4% yearly for the next 3 years (expecting that the increase of msrp from 2020 to 2021 already have the 7.x% inflation):  
MSRP price today: $25k auto loan rate \~2%   
2023:  $26k  (\~ &gt;1k increase)  
2024: $27.04k  (&gt;1k increase)  
2025: $28.12 (&gt;1k increase)

Assuming that the car shortage last 3 years that will be 12.48% MSRP increase or $3.12k above today MSRP. Pre covid the incentive was around 1k to 3k below MSRP for this price range, so someone waiting that long might be expecting to pay similar price as today but with future dollars. Also, you might be paying higher interest rate (unknown for now). 

I will like to know your point of view. I'm not saying that is a good time to buy, but if someone is able to get a car without market adjustment and without addons fees, is this make sense?

On top of that if you have the option to pay cash and decide to get a loan (2%), you can invest the money in ibonds and you very likely get around 7.2% the first year, in the second year you might need to review your investment.",finance,1645563138.0

So unfortunately I've changed the way I spend money and it's not compatible with Mint anymore, so I don't have the full category breakdowns with charts / graphs I've had in the past, but I'll do my best.

**Taxes:**  $50,245. I paid $40,000 in quarterly Federal estimated taxes and $8000 in quarterly State estimated taxes, in addition to the $655 I owed for Federal and $1575 I owed for State last April.   (I realized a bunch of capital gains last year and had some significant interest income.)

**Home:** $3460.  $99 per month for HOA, $515 for the year for Insurance, and I've started investing my HELOC so I have about $185 per month in Interest from that, plus the $50 yearly HELOC maintenance fee.  $1520 in property taxes.

**Healthcare:** $4840.  Health Insurance was $327 last year and $345 starting this year with Dental going from $26 per month to $28 per month.  Got a Crown last year that cost me $565.

**Utilities:** $2450. Electric for the year $842 (just over $100 in the four A/C months, and $50 the rest of the year).  Gas for the year $456 (~$70 in the four winter months, $17 for the rest of the year)  Internet is still $73 per month ($876).  Phone bill is $275 for the year.

**Automotive:** $2175. I spent $1059 on gas last year and drove a total of 5200 miles.  Auto Insurance was $506 per six months, twice, so $1012.  $105 oil change.  No other maintanence, but I'll probably be getting my brakes done and need new tires this year, so that will be a hit.

**Entertainment:**  $657.   $13.77 for Amazon Prime, $7.99 for Disney+, $17.99 for Netflix, $9.99 for Spotify, and $5 for Clash of Clans.  The Prime, Netflix, and Spotify are all reimbursed (~$430 per year).  I also spent around $120 on other video games last year.

Debit Card: $12,592. Now the categorization problem.  I switched over to using a pre-paid debit card (5% cash back) but it does not have Mint integration, and I'm not going to categorize the 400+ lines by hand.  I did a quick run through and just threw a ""1"" next to lines that looked like food / dining / snacks, and a ""2"" against lines that looked like ""misc spending"" whether that be gifts, clothes, shoes, bidet, etc.  That $12,592 is the grand total I put on the debit card over the year with about $2600 of that total already categorized above (e.g. Prime/Netflix/Spotify, Internet, and some other stuff is all on the Debit Card).

**Food:** My ""Food"" tally was $8590.  This more/less matches the $8000-$9000 in spending I've had the past two years.

**Purchases:** $1408.  This included things like my $566 bidet, $80 shoes, a few hundred dollars in Christmas gifts, movie ticket purchases, my $115 concealed pistol license renewal, and other Amazon purchases.

**TOTAL**  Ignoring the Taxes section, my total expenses add to $23,580.  This pretty much jibes with my expenses from last year ($28,000, but I had several big ""one-timers"" last year like the $2000 roof assessment and $3500 TV I bought).

---------------------

**Investments:**

I'll just add to the Table I posted last year.

Type|Retirement Day|1 Year|2 Years|3 Years
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
*Traditional IRA*|$299,000|$348,000|$380,170|$410,285
*Roth IRA*|$14,500|$18,150|$70,236|$75,800
*Brokerage*|$18,400|$22,900|$37,108|$179,110
**Total Vanguard (3 Above)**|$331,800|$389,100|$487,515|$665,195
Other Holdings, Crypto/Bitcoin|$145,000|$291,000|$1,315,000|$985,000
HSA Investment|$6000|$7400|$8760|$9453
Cash|$20,000|$9000|$135,000|$9345

Crypto is down a little bit from where it was 1 year ago, but that still puts me at around $1,670,000 in financial accounts.   During the bull run last year for Bitcoin I sold off a bit and moved the money into my brokerage account, which is why I'm going to have a $40,000+ tax bill this year.

I also started getting into the DeFi, Crypto Lending / Interest Earning systems.  I ended up having interest income of ~$52,000 last year, which is pretty nice given my expenses are in the $25,000 range.  And that was just for the partial year, I'm expecting closer to $80,000+ this year.  

It's a bit risky and out of many peoples comfort zones, but I'd been working out okay for me so far.

**The Living Part**

Is this pandemic thing still going on?  Has it been another whole year already.   

I'm still not going out a whole bunch, but it's certainly not as locked down as before.  My D&amp;D buddy and his wife had another kid last year and the pregnancy was pretty rough (just constantly tired / nauseous.)  So D&amp;D was on hold but I was still going over and playing other games.  Going hard on Gloomhaven, and lately we've been playing Terraforming Mars which was surprisingly good.  Now that the kid is born and Mom's feeling better, last week we had a quick 30-minute ""Session 0"" to re-establish where we are in the world, do some in-town tasks (buy new horses since a Troll ate ours...) and what we want to do going forward.  I just got a text today inviting me over for D&amp;D this weekend, so yay!

Home life is same old.  I'm kind of on a 6-8 hour sleeping cycle many days.  Get up in the morning, drink some water, hang out listening to a podcast or watching a video, then going back to sleep for a few hours.  Lots of periodic napping.

Two of my cousins are planning on a cruise getaway in the fall which I might go on.  I've never been on a cruise but I want to, and this might be a good chance.  My one cousin (36F) has been cruising solo for the past couple years, and now it's her and her brother (34M) who are arranging this thing in the fall.  This might be a good opportunity to reconnect.  The Cousins have never really been close: we all get along and are excited to see each other, but it was really only a twice a year 4th of July and Christmas situation, which totally evaporated the past two years for obvious reasons.

**Moving House**

One last topic, I guess.  I'm considering moving house soon.  I've been in this 800 sq ft condo for 12 years now and I'm thinking about moving to 1) upgrade and 2) be closer to my circle of friends.  [Rough Map](https://i.imgur.com/6PqU5Ky.png)  ""B"" is the D&amp;D friend and one I hang out with the most but is 30 miles away.

As we all get older I can only assume we'll be hanging out together more and more often, especially once these guys start retiring too.  I want to move into a bigger (and nicer) place that is more centrally located to my inner circle of 4 close friends.

There are some really nice areas over there and I'm looking at places that are currently in the $350,000 to $450,000 range.  Things keep coming up for sale and I have my eye on a few neighborhoods, but I'm just not ready to pull the trigger just yet.  I'm not **really** in any rush, there's nothing pushing me other than a mere desire.  So I can wait.  Wait out the pandemic, wait out the... whatever it is the market is doing right now.  Wait for the next Crypto bull run later this year or next year.  But I'll keep looking at Zillow and refining what exactly I'm looking for.  Maybe one will pop up that I just cannot refuse.  We'll see.",finance,1645565503.0
personalfinance,"Cousin is semi-comatose, hospital/gov wants banks statements","\*\*\*\*Update: I appreciate your responses! Part of the issue with the hospital is they are are short staffed due to COVID and pushing anything they can off on family. It appears they have one onsite person and some third-party vendor that keeps sending automated information demand letters to his house. I just did an emergency guardianship and conservatorship for his mom (she has dementia). It's gonna be a grand to tell these people he's not worked since 2020 and his account has maybe three digits in it :(

All I can say is that my entire family was lax in this area. Get your paper straight, as shite absolutely does happen.

\*\*\*\*\*

My cousin has been in ICU since 1/6. He has been alternately in a coma and now not what is considered truly conscious. He is unable to communicate and sporadically aware of his surroundings. To what extent and how long it will take for this to improve is an unknown.

He is fairly young and has no insurance. Dad is dead, mom has dementia and is legally incompetent, so I am the next of kin. The hospital is waffling and struggling with obtaining assistance as they want his last two bank statements. From what I can tell, he did everything paperless. His buddy does his taxes, so I supplied evidence of below poverty income, but they are still adamant nothing can be done without the bank statements. He both needs assistance with the bills and long-term care once he is discharged.

Wells Fargo is adamant that a POA is the only way to release these records. Is that accurate? I can't believe there isn't an agency-to-bank background mechanism for these situations. He can't possibly be the only account holder, in the history of ever, to become totally incapacitated. Any advice on some other number I can call for a division that handles these situations? Main WF CS keeps parotting ""you'd have to get a POA or have him call.""",finance,1645565816.0

stocks,WHY the world needs Electric Vehicles BADLY in light of the Ukraine-Russia Crisis and super high inflation!,"[Thankyou for opening your Tesla Folder 📁](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/)

What the hell is going on?

Russia is invading Ukraine, Oil prices have reached $5 a gallon, inflation is at 40-year highs and it seems like the world is getting scarier and scarier everyday…

# Now more than ever YOU NEED to own a Tesla or Electric Vehicle ….. but why?

In this article I talk about the current insane volatility and dooms-day scenario we find ourselves in and specifically how Tesla and electric vehicles can not only save the planet, save your life but also save you lots of money.

It has never been more important to own an Electric Vehicle than it is now, so here is EXACTLY HOW this information ties to your stock portfolio…..

# The Increasing NEED to own an EV⚠

The market in 2022 is absolutely crazy, inflation has reached the highest levels since 40+ years ago. Meanwhile you might have gotten a 5% raise, woo-hoo, oh. Wait. Because inflation is so f\*cking high you’re purchasing power STILL decreased year over year! How crazy is that? The recent macro currents have not been this unpredictable in a very long time, with both the Federal Reserve tightening and potentially WW3 breaking out with the Russian potential invasion of Ukraine.

Because of all this, it is simple. You need an EV. You' need an EV, because it will drastically reduce the amount of money you’re spending on fuelling up your car and getting it serviced. Tesla recently released an amazing feature that highlights the money Tesla owners are saving by not-having to buy gas for their cars. It’s quite staggering.

In one example a Tesla user saved nearly $300 per month, *$300!* Do you not see how crazy that is? With recent gas prices reaching nearly $5 a gallon, it is becoming unjustifiable to purchase an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle as opposed to an EV.

It is a fact that a Tesla will save you money on fuel costs, maintenance, and depreciation. Buying an EV will save the average driver alot of money on running costs. Oh, and not to mention Tesla’s appreciate? Although this is likely not to last, Tesla cars are now selling for MORE than people bought them for a few years ago.

The worlds current dependency on gas and oil is not only disgustingly harmful for the environment, killing it in the process, but it is also becoming more and more economically costly for us to be this dependent on them, this dependency was and is being exploited by Russia and is putting the world on the edge of war, because..

# A World at War highlighting the importance of EV’s ✏

The current crisis in Ukraine and the fact that Russia is using their supply of Natural gas and Oil as a bargaining chip at the political table is costing thousands of people their lives and highlighting the need for the world to transition to sustainable energy NOW, not tomorrow not 2030 but NOW.

Popular Stock market investor Ross Gerber summarized it strongly;

&gt;“Gas is $5.50 (!!!!) a gallon in Los Angeles. The best incentive EVER to buy an EV and never go to a gas station again! Save yourself from inflation and supporting the Russian invasion. Say NO to OIL.”

A short but powerful and truthful statement. Currently Russia is preparing an invasion of Ukraine and the European Union is struggling to provide meaningful sanctions because majority of its member-states are dependent on Russian Natural gas and Oil in someway.

&amp;#x200B;

This hesitation to react to the clear violation of a countries borders is further reinforced by the current inflationary fears. Every person who owns a car that ISN’T an Electric Vehicle is suffering severely at the hands of unprecedented increasing gas and oil prices.

Currently about 2.3 million barrels of Russian crude ($75 billion a year at current spot prices) heads west each day through a network of pipelines to export terminals on the Baltic and Black Seas, as well as pouring directly into refineries in central and eastern Europe.

This issue is universal and is robbing you of YOUR money.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t just a European issue, as Ross Gerber mentioned, The United States is also feeling the impact of rising gas prices. The change to sustainable energy driven (literally) by electric vehicles is now more-than-ever an important step we must take to make our economies more resilient to political turmoil and the rash action of dictators.

By increasing our Sustainable energy sources we will be able to supply the grid with clean energy whilst decreasing overall costs and stabilizing prices. You will NEVER have to pay insane amounts of money to power your vehicle, to power your daily commute to work. As battery technology develops and EV’s become widespread, this will become the new reality, it is only a matter of when this happens. But not only does owning an EV save you money, it could save your life…..

# Being in a Tesla could save your life ⚡

The current European energy crisis could last years with natural gas stockpiles running lower and lower every day the recent storms hitting the United Kingdom and North-West Europe highlights the dangers of our current energy dependency.

Europe remains at the mercy of Putin and the Weather. Not only will switching to Electric Vehicles decrease this dependency, but Tesla’s are so well built *a Tesla could literally save your life.* With the recent storms creating BILLIONS in damage, some people unfortunately died when trees landed on their cars.

A Tree Fell on Tesla owner Sam Fursey’s car when they where driving, but luckily no-one was injured.

&gt;“ An old tree fell directly on my car, right above the driver's seat.  
I was driving my best friend and his fiancé to their wedding. We all walked away... **thank you higher powers, and Tesla engineers.**

With Tesla’s safety-first design, the Model 3 was able to become “**The safest car ever tested”** by the American National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model 3 literally had the lowest probability of injury in a crash compared to over 900 other vehicles tested. **42,060 people.**

42,060 people died on American roads in 2020. You NEVER know if this could be you, your loved one or one of your friends. Whether it is a tree falling on your car or a drunk driver t-boning your vehicle, you want to have the safest vehicles. Electric Vehicles in general are able to be safer than ICE vehicles due to the battery lowering the centre of gravity of the vehicle and allowing designers (like Tesla) to create significantly stronger castings that will better support the safety of the driver and passengers.

Not only has Tesla driven this safety revolution, [but they are also DOMINATING the Electric Vehicle](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/p/how-our-need-for-teslas-has-never?utm_source=url) market, and the stock price is about to go crazy when Tesla becomes the MOST PROFITABLE Automaker in the world in the year……

# Tesla’s EV dominance, and the future of the Stock Price 📈

Tesla currently comfortably sits as the biggest manufacturer of Electric Vehicles with a market share of 21% meaning that more than 1 in every 5 EV’s sold in the world was a Tesla car. Not only this, but Tesla has profit margins close to 30% whilst the average manufacturer sits at only 7%… Tesla is thus on the perfect path to dominating the world market by selling the MOST Electric Vehicles and also the MOST profitable vehicles. Reminder…..

Tesla is set to become a Trillion dollar company (again) very soon, potentially adding over $200 billion to its current market valuation.

But more importantly, let me tell **you** about Tesla’s DOMINANCE and how **you** should be reacting to the stock market’s recent HUGE violations and specifically how to make or lose money right….

# How to make (or lose) money right now 💸

Breathe. Breathe. Stop panicking. There are so many catalysts for Tesla stock in the coming year(s) it is actually unbelievable. Tesla trading around $800 means it is trading at only 8 X 2022 Revenue! It currently looks incredibly cheap when you keep in mind some short term and long term catalysts.

Whenever you see volatility like this in the market, look at the companies you own and look at HOW they’re performing. The current volatility in the year 2022 likely is irrelevant in 2030 when Tesla is producing potentially around 20 million cars per year. So always ALWAYS keep a long-term horizon.

But for everyone panicking in the short term, *SHOULD I SELL MY TESLA STOCK? or should I buy more? What DO I DO?!!*

I can’t answer that for you, but let me put it this way. Here are the current Short-term Tesla catalysts to keep in mind that:

📈Giga-Texas factory opening soon (Phase 1 capacity of 500,000 vehicles per year)

🏭Giga-Berlin factory opening soon (Phase 1 capacity of 500,000+ vehicles per year) This factory also reduces import costs, thus increasing already high profit margins

🚗Model S and X are ramping production (high margin luxury cars)

🔋 4680 Next-Generation battery cells are ramping production

and so much more, so to ensure you DON’T lose money during this volatile market keep a long term investment horizon. To stay-up to date with all ALL TESLA news feel free to subscribe to my newsletter in which I provide in-depth analysis you will not find anywhere else!

personalfinance,Taxes vastly different from last yr despite same circumstances,"I'm sorry in advance for mobile formatting, I'm at a loss at what else to do or where else to turn.

The company I was working for shut down at the start of the pandemic. I was on unemployment and food stamps up until September of last year. In September I managed to land a work from home job which I still have now. 

The return i got last year was 1200ish. I worked 3 months out of the year for $15 per hour and then was on unemployment the rest of the year due to the employer closing down from complications w covid.

The return I'm looking at now for 2021, I was on unemployment and then worked for $15 September to the end of the year. Almost literally the same situation, almost identical pay at each employer. All taxes were taken out of my ui. I tried filing from the irs website, TurboTax, and freetax USA. All of them state I owe the fed $400 and that I will only recieve $6 from the state.

I've been considering paying a tax advisor to help me here, but if I end uo having to pay them AND the money they are claiming I owe; it will literally bring me to homelessness. I live check to check and am extrenely lucky when I get to squirrel away $50 I didn't have to spend on groceries etc from the previous check.

I have cut out smoking, soda, fast food, streaming services, and going out all together.  There is nothing else I can cut out to try to save money. I even got a work from home job so I could cut out auto insurance/gas and depend more on public transport for my shopping etc.  All I spend my money on is rent/utilities, groceries, phone, and a bag of dog food per month and I'm still falling behind to pay bills or keep food in the house. 

They deny me and say I make too much to qualify for energy assistance or food stamps since getting this new job...but our natural gas prices just doubled this year and now I'm paying half my rent in energy bills to boot.

personalfinance,Should I take the 9 month rate lock on house?,"I'm building a house and one of the lenders can offer a 9 month rate lock.  It is a deposit that is fully refundable of .75% + .5% percent higher than today's rate.  There is a float down policy if its .25% lower than where I locked at closing.

He was able to offer me 4.375% + 0.5% = 4.875% 30 year rate lock for 9 months.

Pros:  I have a ceiling on interest rates and possibility of floating down

Cons:  Builder not delivering on time, $4K lost.  I lose all negotiating power and have to use one lender.

At this point, I'm thinking of saying fuck it and just let it ride until close.  Using my crystal ball, I think rates are going to go sideways to SLIGHTLY up by year end which is when I think my house will be completed.  So if I just don't lock, I can start pricing different lenders.

personalfinance,"About to graduate, how should I budget my income/expenses?","I \[22M\] am going to graduate this semester and I already landed a full-time job. I will start in the summer/fall of this year and going to make $75,000. My monthly take-home should be a little over $4,500/month. I also have about $16,000 invested in mutual funds and etfs, and a few grand on a wide variety of stocks, and a tiny bit of crypto.

As far as I know, my job can be fully virtual. However, since the NYC major is a nutjob, he could force us to work in person. If I have to commute to work, I'll have to find parking, take the train, and take the subway for the quickest and least-stressful commute. If I commute 3 days per week, it'll cost me about $450/month. If commuting for 5 days a week, it'll cost me about $500/month. 

Also, my parent's got me a leased car about 2 years ago. They paid for the first two years of the car and insurance, but I have to take over once I start working. The lease is $370/month and insurance is going to be $130/month. I want to buy the car when the lease runs out because not only is it a low-mileage and reliable car, the residual value is $15,800 (2020 Mazda CX-5) and I did tons of maintenance on it so far. Anyway, my parents told me I could pay them $5,000 and they'll cover for the whole year.

My student loans total to $29,000 after graduating. They are federal loans. I thought I signed up for 4.5% apr but apparently they're 5% on the loan servicer's website. I don't like the idea of having a debt with no collateral at all. So, I want to get rid of it ASAP.

I have the option (and expected to) live at my parent's house for at least one year. I can live here for longer than that, but honestly, my entire family wants to move out of this house. But long-story short, I have at least a year or so of not having to pay rent.

I have other upcoming expenses as well. I will have to spend $1,800 to get my college credits required for my license and create a new office space in my room (with painting, idk how much it would cost). I may also have to spend some on my teeth (I *was* close to needing root canals, but I definitely need my 3 wisdom teeth removed soon and possibly get braces). 

My credit score is very good.

How should I budget my incoming salary and expenses? I want to pay off my student loans and fully own my car as soon as possible so that I can start accumulating $$.

Had no hip/leg problems. Could run around for hours even at 16 yrs old. He honestly looked like a puppy in a 16 year old dog.

it all started where he suddenly couldn't jump up on things, like the sofa, or our bed.

He could walk fine despite this, few days went by he got worse, now he couldn't do the stairs, but he could still have a nice walk, without limping. next day, he had small limp struggled to walk a little..  we took him to the vet, vet diden't do any xrays, but instead moved his leggs around and pressed on his spine, she couldn't find any indication there was pain, just a bit of stiffness in his back leggs, she could also see he was struggling to walk. Vet noticed their was a tumor, or possible cancer on his lower abdoman, she said it could be harmless, so she perscribed my dog some of their strongest painkillers, incase it was a pulled muscle. We saw a small improvement the next day he could stand up better, from the laying down position, next day it got worse and he was paralysed, and had to be put down.

Now how can this be? That the pain killers make a difference, then the next day he is paralysed?

personalfinance,Sign on bonus and taxes,"For the first time in my life, I'm getting a sign on bonus with a new company, 

Let's say, the bonus was $10,000. 

I know I need to pay federal taxes of 22% on it, which is lower than my current tax bracket so I'm ok with that. 

Do I need to pay state taxes on top of that? If so, should I claim additional deductions on my w4?

Also, I heard that I can elect deductions which will offset the taxes. So let's say I get a bonus of $10,000. If I elect a $10,000 withholding over the course of the year, does that mean I will get the full $10,000 back in my tax refund? It seems risky to me to leave it up to the IRS, but this is my first time dealing with these matters.

personalfinance,Making Payment to IRS for Federal Tax... Before the Official Balance Showed Up.,"I owe the IRS money for Federal Taxes so as soon I filed via FreeTaxUSA, I received a text confirmation that my Federal Tax Return was accepted by the IRS. 

I saw the amount I need to owe on FreeTaxUSA so I created for ACI Payments, Inc.  and sent a partial payment through (about 2/3 of what I owed). Thinking how am I going to know my actual remaining balance, I decided to look it up and just found out that I can make an IRS account to see the balance.

When I logged in, it showed that my current balance is $0 as of today and that my 2021 Tax Return is not processed. It said ""If you've already filed, processing usually takes 21 days (electronic returns) "".

If I had to guess, when my balance finally gets posted, it should be the remaining 1/3 of the amount that I originally owe due to already using ACI Payments, Inc. to make some payment.

That's what will happen... right? Kind of freaking out here. At least I have a confirmation of payment but it's a payment before a balance is posted.",finance,1645579441.0

We'd love to get a home one day but it's not really practical right now with how crazy the housing market seems as of late.

Does it make sense to shift more of my savings towards 401k to get a higher match rather than keeping extra cash on me that will depreciate some with inflation? Should I keep on saving away for a house and find more room to pay more into 401k?

personalfinance,Moving out to benefit social life vs. staying home to benefit finances?,"Here's my situation:   
Age: 26 in a few months  
Salary: $90K with up to 15% bonus   
Monthly after deductions/retirement: $3,800  
Debt: $30K federal student loans (currently on pause)  
Cash Savings: $73K, but planning to wipe out SLs when they resume, so realistically $43K  
Retirement Savings: $13.5K Roth IRA, $24K Traditional 401K (currently max both)  
   
I've always been one to want to save, but I'm starting to think that may be negatively affecting other areas of my life. I wouldn't say I'm cheap - I never avoid going out or buying something I want for the sake of saving every penny. But if I can save, I like to. I've been extremely lucky to be in a situation where basically everything is covered for me: no rent, no utilities, no car payment/insurance, hell I even barely have to buy groceries.  
  
My dad and I get along, but I can't help but wonder if moving out would be more beneficial to my social/dating life than the financial gain I currently get by living at home. I don't have many friends, partially because I can't really have people over to just hang out. In the same vein, it's taken a toll trying to date at times too. I'm part of the LGBT community, and I live 20 minutes from a top-10 populous city. I do get out and get the chance to interact with like-minded people, but sometimes it's an event just to try to get together with commuting and all. Going out/staying out late is also tough at times because I either have to A) leave early to get public transit, B) not really drink so I can drive home, or C) pay for Ubers which get expesive. I'd like to have more friends and connections within the community, but it can be challenging with the distance.  
  
I've often been told to stay at home as long as possible to save, but do I need to rethink my mindset for my non-financial self? I just can't help but get caught up in all the costs that would be associated with it. Between rent, utilities, food, city &amp; sales tax would eat an additional 6% of my income, it all just seems like a lot to take on at once. I think financially it would be doable, but for someone who can hyper-fixate on spending, it's somewhat daunting.",finance,1645592545.0

personalfinance,Taking out a loan for investments up front then paying it off over time?,"Hello everyone

To clarify I am but a teenager who is extremely interested in business and finance, not someone who needs to apply this advice anytime soon

I had a thought the other day that occurred to me when looking over how mathematically speaking, by simply placing a few hundred dollars a month into index funds over the course of a few decades, you can become a millionaire via compounding

What I think could be a possible, better alternative to this is as per the title, where instead of contributing money every month towards index funds, you simply take one massive loan when you're young for index funds, and simply redirect the payments to paying off that debt, allowing for you to utilize the same amount of money but compound even further

Of course the biggest issue would be the fact that banks probably would not approve of this, especially not without a security and to someone who is quite Young. If in some other scenario, someone might be able to have say a relative agree to do this, what other further complications could there be in either scenario? But this even be possible? How could it be achieved?

So ofc the other two factors would be interest rates and market volatility",finance,1645593303.0

CryptoCurrency,What is the definition of inflation and why it matters,"I know, to most of us this will seem an obvious and a silly question. Everybody knows that inflation is the rise in market prices. Except it is not. 

 Rising prices are not an inflation but the side effects of the inflation. 

Inflation is the increase in the supply of money. Rising prices and decreasing purchasing power are the possible causes of inflation. 

The above definition of inflation was the widely accepted truth for a very long time. Then, somewhere at the beginning of the last century, inflationist and interventionist economists and politicians altered the meaning of the word *inflation* and made it the equivalent of price increases. This was by no accident or mistake. The word trick was a powerful tool which enabled and perpetuated the destructive inflationist policies of our rulers. 

First of all, how can you fight something you cannot name? How can an economist who sees the true harmful nature of inflationist policies argue and promote the truth, if he has no way to name what policy he is fighting? Every time he has to explain how the government destroys the wealth of the nation, he needs to start with defining and explain the meaning of inflation, and waste his and the listeners’ mental energy on a semantic battle that shouldn’t be there to begin with.

Secondly, this trick opens a room for many phony theories and interpretations about who to blame for the diminishing purchasing power of money. Think yourselves, if inflation is when prices increase, then who said it was caused by money printing or artificial expansion of credit? It maybe because of supply shortages, or the greedy businessmen, or any other realistic or lunatic reason that will come up to your mind. 

Or imagine doctors who define alcoholism as a state of decaying liver and who only patch the liver without cutting the supply of liquor that goes into the patient's body… Well, that’s exactly what inflationist governments are doing to their nations. Except, they are also forcefully putting the bottle into the man’s mouth and threatening to shoot him if he stops drinking… 

We do not have 7% inflation. 

We have 7% increase in consumer prices (which we all know is more around 10-15%…), the greatest asset bubble in history and all sorts of economic distortions, which are caused by the US government and the Fed **inflating the US dollar by 40% in one year alone**.

So, to sum up, inflation is the increase in the supply of money, and, considering we live in the world of paper money, the government is the one who has the power to create inflation, and, therefore, the one that should be held responsible for it. 

This is why it is important we reclaim the word *inflation*. Words matter, otherwise the semantic revolution would not be the top priority of the fighting ideological forces.",cryptocurrency,1645610018.0

Edit:

Thank you all for participating in this discussion.

One thing I would like to point out is the following:

Many of you say, buffet and munger die equals the company losing hard. I don’t agree to be honest.

They often said, that measures were taken to provide for the success of the company after they pass.

Also, one of the things Buffet himself said was:

„We want to buy businesses, that can outlive a (relative) short period of bad management. „ (or smth. Like this).

I read this like -&gt; Coca Cola ceo dies? Well, people will still drink coke.

I think the same thing applies here.

The business was of course very influenced by those two but I personally think, that their influence reduced in the past few years. That is natural ofc. 

So my guess would be short term volatility at most.
 
But who knows…

But the future 5 or so years of home demand is what matters. Heres a list of things I think are important. If you know the industry and any specific ones like DHI, MHO, let me know what else I should be considering.

-lumber supply and prices

-location of home being built (south like texas area is booming while north not really)

-the company focus. Starter tract homes in higher demand than luxury

-usage of land options vs pre purchasing gives less debt liability makes the company more lean and flexible

-valuing based on fcf is pointless (unless you seperate maint cap) because most of capex is building new homes and inventory, using earnings growth and book value/equity is better

-its a cyclical business, currently the housing market has short supply and high demand

-interest rates hikes cut down mortgage approvals which is a downward pressure, though may be compensated by such short supply

-labour shortage currently is a downward pressure

I noticed a $252.61 transaction on my American Express statement that is labeled FedEx back in September of last year an started a dispute and reported this as a fraud activity with AmEx. Amex ruled in my favor after their investigation, during which FedEx sent them details of the shipment including the names and addresses of the sender and recipient (both of which were unfamiliar to me, although we share a same last name for some reason). 

After that the amount was sent to collection by FedEx as I attemped to communicate with them that this was in deed closed by AmEx. At some point my FedEx account was closed.

Months after, I still got demands from FedEx's collection partner. I called FedEx Billing and then they got me to Fraud Unit when I told them about the details (although I am sure some other FedEx staff were also aware of the issue last year). The Fraud unit told me that they couldn't do anything about it because it's past 60 days and referred me back to Billing. Today, Revenue Service emailed me and stated: ""  After reviewing the information, we are unable to approve your request at this time. Due to the age of the invoice, a credit cannot be processed to your account. To qualify for a refund or credit due to unauthorized shipment, you must notify us of the service failure and request a refund or credit of your transportation charges via one of the approved channels within 60 calendar days of the invoice date or within 60 calendar days from the ship date if you are paying by credit card or in advance by cash, check or money order.""

At this point I am not quite sure what I am supposed to do? I was naive enough last year to have thought that disputing with American Express is enough to notify FedEx of this issue as well - I was never told to also open a second fraud inquiry with FedEx. And now neither FedEx Billing nor their Fraud team could help. When will this affect my credit score? Can I dispute with the collection agency? I have the names and addresses of the recipient and sender of that unrecognized shipment - should I send that to somebody else? Any advice would help. Thanks!",finance,1645628276.0
personalfinance,Target denied a claim on a empty box they sent me that should of had a phone.,"I ordered a google pixel 6 from target (got a discount with my red card), $600 was a big purchase for me, and is a very big deal for me. I received a damaged box from fedex that was completely empty with obvious signs of tampering. It was left on my doorstep, they didnt put a signature requirement on it.

The target branded tape was cut mangled and torn and it was sealed back up with clear packing tape on the side they tore open. After waiting 5 business days target denied my claim saying the package was delivered properly. Ive entered a claim with the card, but since its a target card I doubt they'll say anything differently.

Should I file a police report, and possibly take them to small claims court? How would I even begin to file since it wasnt a local store, but the website that I ordered from?

Edit: FedEx won't let me talk to them, I've tried over the phone and online, they will only deal with target.

*     I am a 33 yo with chronic illness that could result in disability or death within 5-10 years
*     Married with no children
*     Combined gross income of ~$165,000/year and file taxes jointly
*     Monthly expenses ~3100
*     Owe ~100,000 in Federal student loans (most interest rates 6-6.8%). No other debt.
*     Minimal retirement savings (70,000 in my 401a/50,000 in partner's Roth IRA)
*     Have a 6.5 month emergency fund
*     Anticipate leaving current job in a couple years due to partner's work

**Dilemma: How to distribute 125,000 in additional savings?**

*     I would like to maximize what I can put toward retirement/other investments over the next couple years to set it up so that I have some funds to draw from if I can't work anymore (worse case scenario)

**Is this a sound plan?**

*     20,000 to I-bonds (max for me + spouse - this is for short-term savings goals like a house or car)
*     7,000 to Roth IRA (max out 2021 for me + 1,000 to max for spouse)
*     Pay off all student loans (~100,000)
*     Start maxing out my employer retirement options for 2022:
*         20,500 pre-tax to 403b
*         20,500 pre-tax to 457b
*         (My employer contributes ~14% of my salary to a 401a, about 16,800/year; no matching in the other accounts. No access to an HSA)

**Or alternatively:**

*     Contribute less toward student loans and put more into a brokerage account?
*     Or I could pay-off the student loans, only contribute to the 457b and put the rest in a brokerage account?
*     Other suggestions?

**Other question:**

*     I think I can max out the 403b (despite the employer contribution of 16,800 to a 401a) + also max out the 457b and Roth-IRA. Is this correct?",finance,1645635033.0
Bitcoin,European Union plans to forbid Bitcoin and Proof of Work Cryptos,"So, this just happened: [https://www.btc-echo.de/news/bitcoin-spd-gruene-und-linke-fordern-verbot-in-der-eu-135678/](https://www.btc-echo.de/news/bitcoin-spd-gruene-und-linke-fordern-verbot-in-der-eu-135678/)

Automated Translation:

Cramming crypto regulation. The European Parliament wants to prohibit the provision of crypto services based on ""environmentally unsustainable consensus mechanisms"" in its MiCA guidelines. This is according to a final compromise proposal from the responsible Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), which is available to BTC-ECHO. De facto, this could mean the end for proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from January 1, 2025 in the European Union. The final decision on the draft is to be made in Parliament on February 28.

Stefan Berger told BTC-ECHO that he believes it is ""very likely"" that the proposal will go through. As Chairman of the ECON Committee, he is largely responsible for the design of the MiCA Directive on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the European Parliament. The advance of the Bitcoin ban had thereby the SPD, Greens and Left energetically demanded, said the CDU politician in an interview with BTC-ECHO.

The parliamentary groups of the Christian Democrats, right-wing conservatives and liberals would have vehemently resisted the inclusion of the ban in the negotiations. In the end, the Social Democrats, Greens and Left threatened to otherwise withhold their approval of the MiCA draft, according to reports. Previously, SPD politician Joachim Schuster had already publicly called for a bitcoin ban. Green Party European politician Sven Giegold also spoke to BTC-ECHO in favor of illegalization.

The vote next Monday will be followed by a trilogue between the EU Commission, the Parliament and the member states, at the end of which the Commission will be tasked with evaluating the Parliament's proposal. The decision on this should be expected before the end of this year. In the October 2020 draft, the Commission opposed a bitcoin ban.

Bitcoin clause is ""fatal""

Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner did not want to comment on the impending bitcoin ban to BTC-ECHO. Frank Schäffler (FDP), member of the Budget Committee of the Bundestag, considers the new proposal of the EU Parliament ""fatal"". He already called for changes to the MiCA guidelines last year.

I assume and also expect that the German government and the lead finance minister Christian Lindner will prevent this.

Robert Kopic of the industry association Blockchain for Europe also sees the potential for the clause to ""put Europe at a disadvantage.""

This is a point that would put Europe, along with its green miners, at a disadvantage and would solely lead to them migrating abroad and Europe losing geopolitical access to Bitcoin.

The economic disadvantages of a Bitcoin ban are therefore obvious. A fact that the EU Commission will also take into account in its MiCA assessment, says Stefan Berger. What the final decision will ultimately look like is uncertain at this point.",cryptocurrency,1645635303.0
stocks,Why I'm Bearish,"1. Interest rates r not priced in as no one knows what they will be. Additionally, analysts base their goofy PTs/DCFs off the 10 year, which will change, which will cause analysts to slash said PTs.
2. GDP is whateverish and unemployment is extremely contaminated data.
3. No one has any idea what inflation is at. If you use the old metrics it would show us at around 16%. The amount of money this country printed and gave away is unreal. Wages cannot match.
4. If Russia invades, it will affect gas, neon, palladium, etc. n screw everyone.
5. Supply chain is a little better, but we are months if not a year or two away from getting back. People do not want to work and wages are an issue...a major one.
6. Deaths are still high with Covid. Winter is ending and we might be in a downtrend, but herd immunity with this sort of virus is not permanent...short-lived in fact. Additionally it could mutate and we all could die.

But the stock has taken a beating unfairly due to their recent acquisition, profit taking, and general market jitters for anything that has a supply chain. But the fact of the matter is, Crocs is an incredible company on a tear and it looks like the stock may have just hit bottom. Some facts to support my case:

1. CROX is down -54% from its all time high
2. Trading at a P/E of 8, making it a value stock unfairly grouped into the growth-stock-garbage bucket. It's nearest peer/competitor, Decker's, trades at a P/E of 20 and has 1/4 of the revenue growth (10% for DECK)
3. Revenue growth = 43% q/q and 67% TTM
4. Projected earnings growth is 23% for 2022
5. EBIT margin is high at 31%
6. Trading at 9x free cash flow
7. Will benefit from people going back to stores
8. Brand is incredibly recognizable and beloved. I've tried finding replacements, but it's not worth the hassle when they just work
9. Company continues to invent new types of footwear, from slippers and boots sold for winter to women's sandals that aren't ugly
10. It's a favorite shoe of parents. Kids can pee on them, puke on them, drop ice cream on them and they clean up fast in a sink. And unlike sneakers it doesn't take 20mins to put them on kids
11. Refinitiv just upgraded the stock to a buy as did Zacks.
12. Most recent analyst upgrade sets the price at $200 (if you pay attention or care about analyst opinions - I don't but it does give some signs of potential momentum building). It's trading at 81/share.
13. TA shows a double bottom at $79
14. Insiders just started buying the stock
15. CEO guidance was very strong for 2022 and beyond, forecasting revenue growth of 300% by 2026
16. They still have 1B set aside for stock buybacks in 2022.
17. They are in position to capitalize on the coming post-covid revenge travel and spring/summer weather
18. Their acquisition of Hey Dude will add over 600m in annual revenue at 31% profit and increase their online DTC channels, which were already up 64% yoy. This will enable them to keep their margins high due to not having to pay for the middle man. They paid 2B in cash for the deal but financed the entire thing at today's low interest rates so they have retained their own cash for expansion/buybacks.
19. Market cap is currently just under 5B at a price to sales ratio of 2. Even at that reasonable valuation, if they hit the 6B in sales by 2026 they project, they would be worth 12B. I think it's more likely they will be trading much higher than that.

stocks,Here's why I'm Bearish,"EDIT: I'm going to have to put this up top. I'm here for healthy, reason-based debates. If you disagree because your emotions are hurt, sorry, maybe investing isn't for you. If you say I'm just a clueless permabear but can't care to explain why (other than ""buy every dip, stonks only go up""), maybe you are the clueless one :) Let's all have a healthy debate and provide constructive views to help each other. If you have a very strong, reason-based argument that's better than mind, I will change my mind.

As a response to the other post I saw...

1. Rates / currency / repo markets have priced in 6.5 rate hikes, not EQUITY or other risk asset markets. If you survey CIOs/PMs that manage risk assets, they still think 4 or less... NONE think 6 or 7.
   1. In rate hiking cycles, the Fed has ALWAYS followed the rate markets (so unless something changes, expect 6-7 hikes this yr)
2. Economic data are strong BUT it's decelerating - that's what matters. MARKETS DON'T WANT RATE HIKES INTO GROWTH SLOWDOWN! Remember 4Q18? What matters is if growth is accelerating or decelerating, not whether growth is positive.
   1. Omicron data will make it look like Jan was good but the key months to look at will be Mar-May. If you look at 4Q earnings, 2022 guidance and EPS revisions have been weak! 4Q earnings vs. consensus have been weaker than historical average.
   2. Also unemployment figures are one of the most, if not the most, lagging indicator... So the danger is if the Fed is looking at unemployment figures (which is their bigger mandate) to see if they should stop hiking - they might only change their stance when it's too late.
3. Consumer looks strong on AVERAGE but a more detailed look is very worrisome... The gap between haves and have-nots are getting a lot worse..
   1. Consumer savings are up but very concentrated for the rich. The have-nots barely have any to go around (\~40% have &lt;$1,000)
   2. Wage inflation is more pronounced at higher paying jobs (look at [Atlanta Fed Wage Tracker](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) by wage level). REAL WAGE is FALLING for the have-nots. The have-nots are really hurting right now and everybody knows!
4. Inflationary pressures likely won't ease that much. China's zero COVID policy is a major reason but I'm not sure if anybody is really investing into more capacity closer to home (certainly not the case in autos and low end semis where we see massive shortages - but curious to hear if others have different data points). If COVID has led to a structural shift of demand to higher consumption of goods vs. pre-COVID levels due to more permanent WFH (I heard \~50% of US employees can WFH, and I know I certainly will WFH a significant amount of the time), the supply chain is NOT READY yet and will continue to have bottlenecks (for example, I heard shipbuilders don't have labor supply cuz of COVID )
   1. We also don't know if there will be future mutations that could throw the picture worse on inflation, like Omicron did
   2. My guess is inflation likely peaks in Feb (base effects work both ways) but will stay elevated this year
   3. Generally on supply chain... yes, it's improving, but it's still CRAZY backed up. From what I've heard, we've gone from 4.5 std dev over on supply chain bottlenecks to like 4 std dev over is improving, but its still 4 std dev higher.. Curious to hear if people with boots on the ground are hearing something different
5. Inflation is the most important political issue for voters based on polls (see point 3)! More important than COVID or Ukraine or whatever. Biden is saying Powell is going to address them (with rate hikes). It's mid-term elections in 2022... so it's important
6. Don't even get me started on valuations. I know your growth stocks are down 50-80% bust just look at S&amp;P valuations vs. historicals (it's not apples to apples but hard to say S&amp;P is cheap)

So put that together, I don't really see what the upside for S&amp;P / broader markets look like. I think the bulls are not looking at some of these deep enough (stuck at 1st order thinking). So the main issue is **if inflation is &gt;3% in 2022 with massive growth slowdown and thus Fed wants to hike way more than equity markets are anticipating, can S&amp;P go up?** The Fed has said they want inflation to run hot to catch up to long run 2%, but guess what? ITS CAUGHT UP!

Tl;dr: **DONT FIGHT THE FED**. It goes both ways. Don't try to buy into the dip pre-maturely when the **FED HASNT EVEN RAISED YET AND STILL BUYING BONDS!** They're gonna hike more than equity markets want to and let's not forget QT, which is gonna be even worse and not nearly talked about enough. Wait until Fed changes its stance is my honest opinion. Famous last words in markets are ""this is priced in"".

Edit: minor text edit to point 1 and 5

Edit PS: I don't know the future. This doesn't mean sell everything, go to cash. This is just to inform you of my view that there's just more downside than upside imo. I'll try to do a follow up post when that changes and when I turn bullish because some of you are asking when is it good to buy or when I would  be a buyer. I'm not a perma-bear - I'm still young and think growth stocks are cheap af right now. That doesn't mean they can't get cheaper.",finance,1645638889.0
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto shows key signs of strength, even as prices struggle amid geopolitical turmoil","Ever-escalating tensions in Ukraine and unanswered questions about the Fed’s plan to raise interest rates continue to pressure global markets and crypto prices this week — the S&amp;P 500 entered correction territory as BTC dropped below $37,000 on Monday, shedding roughly 5% since Sunday. But for the broader cryptoeconomy, prices are only part of the story, and the news — surprisingly — isn’t all bad. Despite troubling geopolitical headlines, the crypto market has quietly notched a handful of wins over the last few weeks, from rising global adoption to Wall Street’s ever-growing appetite for crypto. Let’s dig in.

* **Bitcoin mining power reached a new all-time high,** as more miners compete to earn BTC rewards in return for verifying transactions and bolstering the blockchain. Mining power (or “hashrate”) — often cited as a proxy for network health and security — hit new highs last week on February 17, a robust recovery from last summer’s lows after China’s mining crackdown. Since China’s ban, North America has emerged as the world’s leading miner, accounting for more than 35% of Bitcoin’s hashrate. 
* **Nearly** **25% of consumers** **around the world own crypto**, **according to a new survey** that finds the highest rates of adoption in Latin American countries, where crypto investments reached $653 million in 2021. As inflation rages in the region, nearly 50% of Argentinians report owning crypto, and crypto credit cards are also booming in the country. Nearby Brazil saw around $12 billion worth of Bitcoin trading volume in 2021, and Rio de Janeiro, its second largest city, plans to invest 1% of its treasury in crypto. 
* **Several U.S. states are proposing crypto bills while awaiting a crypto-related** **executive order** **from the White House.** A Tennessee bill would allow the state to invest in crypto, an Arizona legislator wants to make BTC legal tender, and Missouri legislation would exempt BTC from state taxes. Meanwhile, Wyoming lawmakers may create a stablecoin, and Colorado’s governor announced the state will soon accept crypto for tax payments.
* **Global financial firms are staffing up crypto divisions and expanding crypto offerings for customers.** While Mastercard plans to hire 500 people to expand crypto consulting services, Fidelity launched a BTC-backed fund in Europe, and the New York Stock Exchange filed trademark licenses to create its own NFT marketplace. And J.P. Morgan (which now has a \*checks notes\* virtual lounge in the metaverse) reports that 300 banks in the U.S. are planning to enable BTC trading.

**Why it matters…** Although Ukraine news is weighing on global markets and crypto prices, a zoomed-out perspective offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the cryptoeconomy as more governments, companies, and individuals join the fold. From Intel’s new energy-efficient mining chip to Twitter’s ETH-tipping feature, the list of innovations and opportunities in this vast $1.7 trillion market will only continue to grow.

The idea is that you buy an EV, and you can claim $7,500 off your taxes for Tax Year 2022 when you do taxes next year.

&gt;Why Do You Keep Saying “Up To”?

&gt;Because it requires taxpayer eligibility. “The qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle credit is a nonrefundable federal tax credit of up to $7,500,” according to Jackie Perlman, principal tax research analyst at H&amp;R Block’s Tax Institute. “The credit reduces your tax liability dollar for dollar. Tax liability means the amount of tax figured on your net taxable income. If the credit is more than your tax liability, you won’t receive the rest of the credit.”

&gt;That means, for example, that **if you owe $4,000 in taxes before applying the $7,500 credit, your tax bill will be reduced to $0, but you won’t receive that extra $3,500.**

ethereum,Original Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum,"#Original Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum

The first lie is that ethereum, and many other cryptocurrency projects claim to be “decentralized”. If you asked 100 people in the ethereum camp what “decentralized” means, they’ll generally respond with a vague answer that, in essence, says either no one controls the project, or, everyone has a say in the project. 


#Let's 
examine the belief of ‘no one controls the project’. Let's examine if this statement is true or not. If no one controls the project, that means no one can make the rules. If no one controls the project, it means that miners can create extra coins out of thin air because ‘no one controls the project’. Users would be able to create coins out of thin air as well because ‘no one controls the project’. Being that users and miners of ethereum can not create new coins out of thin air means ‘no one controls the project’ is misinformation. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, we can take a look at the statement of  ‘everyone has a say’ in the project, and see if this statement regarding “decentralization” is true or not. This statement is designed to make people involved in the project feel like they have some sort of power in telling someone else how the project should be controlled. If this were the case, then a miner would say that he should be granted more coins because he pays more for his electricity than other miners. And, since ‘everyone has a say’ in the project, he would be given extra coins. Obviously, this is not the case either. 

#We 
have addressed both statements in their contexts, and concluded that, in the context of “decentralized”, the two statements are false. We can now start to explain how bitcoin really works. But, before we do that, I want to explore a little deeper on why the two statements of “decentralized” seem to resonate with the majority of the crypto space.

Claiming that ‘no one controls it’ or ‘everyone controls it’ sounds somewhat poetic. It sounds like a flower in the wild that can grow on it’s own, yet can be watered and enjoyed by everyone. This is why the statement and sentiment is so popular in this space. Yet, if you try to apply either of the statements to the real world, they don't hold water. If a miner believes that no one can control the project, and issues himself an extra 5000 bitcoins, it wouldn’t work. To the same extent, if a miner believed ‘everyone controlled the project’ and tried to reward himself 5000 bitcoins, that, too, wouldn’t work. 

#The
 issuer of Ethereum, Vitalik Beuterin, wants people to believe that he isn’t in control of Ethereum. He wants to distance himself as much as he can from his own project. This is because of the fraud  committed during the ICO days of Ethereum. And the shenanigans continues to this day. The truth is that Vitalik is the issuer of Ethereum. 

An ICO is nothing new, despite what the millennials are made to believe. An initial coin offering is regulated by the SEC. The practice of creating and issuing tokens to be traded for profit has been going on before the 1960’s. Just because the tokens are digital, doesn’t make a difference to the SEC. A claim for scalping (fraud) is generally one involving promoters of securities. Here is an SEC case may seem familiar:

#“In
 a related scheme, the Commission charges that Czuczko touted shares of his own company, Epic Media, Inc. Epic Media, based in Los Angeles, is a development stage company with plans to publish “lifestyle magazines” for men and women. Czuczko is Epic Media’s CEO and CFO, and chairman of the company’s board of directors, as well as its majority shareholder. The Commission alleges that in early December 2005 Czuczko recommended the purchase of Epic Media stock on a website that was the predecessor to the Stockster site. After the price of Epic Media stock spiked, Czuczko sold his shares for a small profit. Czuczko did not publicly disclose those trades, among others, in stock ownership forms required to be filed with the Commission under federal securities laws.” 

Most individuals purchased Ethereums ICO, not as a utility, but as a security. They purchased to make money from the rising price. This practice is regulated by the SEC. Vitalik did not register with the SEC prior to his Ethereum ICO in 2014. 

Further more, when a developer, or issuer changes the protocol of a a blockchain project, they are in fact, issuing new tokens. That means, whenever there is a fork of any kind, the issuer(s) are issuing new tokens, different from the previous token. We’ll discuss this in more detail later. 

#For now,

 realize that Ethereum has several red flags, including fraud-like behavior. Also, Ethereum’s issuer is actively trying to distance himself from the project to avoid accountability. And most of the Ethereum believers are under the spell that ethereum is decentralized with no one being held accountable for new tokens set to be issued in the coming fork. 


When bitcoin was released in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, all 21 million tokens were created and released to the world. The protocol was set in stone in 2009. No more bitcoin tokens could be created per the protocol. All of the bitcoin protocols were created, and couldn’t be changed at the base level. Which means bitcoin KO’s Ethereum in every aspect imaginable.",cryptocurrency,1645650636.0

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin will be seen as a scam, a fad, or some kind of benevolent magic for the rest of our lives.","In order to understand the value of bitcoin, it requires you to understand the nature of money. To anyone who has taken a long, sober look at the current monetary system, it's plain to see that it's among the greatest scams in human history. Central banks have a legal monopoly over the counterfeiting of money. Through monetary policy, they have literally enslaved mankind.

All of us, our parents, and our grandparents have known nothing else. We have literally been born into slavery and are none the wiser. As I'm sure some of you have learned, the denial and cognitive dissonance that surrounds this fact is unbreakable. For this reason, the rise of bitcoin will never make sense to the masses.

As adoption increases and the price rises, those who cannot open their eyes will forever maintain that it's a scam, a fad, or some kind of benevolent magic. The explosion in prosperity will be counter to everything they know. How could tinkering with the money lead to such widespread and extreme increases in the standard of living? How could such a simple change pull so many out of poverty? How is it that we all need to work far less hours than before? 

Even as they adopt it, they will not understand why it is monumentally superior - its extraordinary success relative to fiat cannot simply be explained by ""it's better money"". Why would switching from one digital currency to another digital currency remake the world as we know it? Surely it's not because bitcoin is a mechanism to escape slavery toward freedom. It must be a scam, or a fad, or magic. Magic will increasingly be the dominant explanation as regular folk FOMO and are compelled to buy in.

The degree to which civilization has been handicapped by fiat cannot be overstated, especially when you consider the exponential increases in productivity brought about by technology. We should be orders of magnitude richer than our parents were at our age, but we're somehow much poorer. It is because there is a giant, parasitic leach firmly latched onto society that is sucking all the wealth out of our hands and into the hands of the Cantillonaires. These are the politically well-connected and the cartel of banks that make up the Federal Reserve and other central banks. They are firmly responsible for the ever-widening wealth gap and increases in poverty.

Most people will never ""get it."" To suppose that the government is not acting in your best interest is wrongthink. It's heresy. To consider that they have systematically lied to you about the nature of government, that you've been indoctrinated since birth, that the media has been their silent partner this whole time, and that they have outright enslaved you and your ancestors.. just forget it. There is no way the public will ever concede this.

The average Joe and Jane can never make sense of bitcoin. To understand its true significance is to understand that you are not free. You are the opposite of free. And they lied to you from day 1. This fact will forever be met with denial and they will maintain this denial to their graves.

As Mark Twain put it, ""It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they've been fooled."" Maybe that's why this old r/bitcoin ad was so effective. [""Magic internet money!

He also suggested that the bond-buying program could wrap up by mid-2014. While Bernanke did not announce an interest rate hike, he suggested that if inflation followed a 2% target rate and unemployment decreased to 6.5%, the Fed would likely start raising rates. The stock markets dropped by approximately 4.3% over the three trading days following Bernanke's announcement, with the Dow Jones dropping 659 points between 19 and 24 June, closing at 14,660 at the end of the day on 24 June.

personalfinance,"Some Micro information that I learned today in a conversation with a mortgage lender (student loans, time lines, etc).","I’m just putting this out there in case others have similarly mistaken ideas of how things will work for you.  As someone who’s been paying in his student loans for 10+ years and still has &gt;$100k to pay, I’ve done a fair amount of research as to what I can possibly do to own a home.  But, that research didn’t reveal some things to me.  Hopefully it helps.

My biggest misconception is that my debt to income ratio would impact my interest rate.  I’d waited longer than necessary to start this process because of it.  According to the two lenders I’ve spoken to, DTI has much more to do with whether you qualify for a mortgage at all…and which programs you might qualify for.  It has a much smaller effect on interest rates.  Even though their current, non-ideal formula (.5% of total debt paid monthly) is much more than I would actually pay on ibr (by about $500/mo), I was still given a 4.25% estimate…which is competitive.

Secondly, whatever rates you’ve researched are subject to change until you ‘lock in’ your rate, which happens after you’re ready or have made an offer on a property, which can happen 2-5 months, or more, after you’ve been pre-approved for your mortgage loan.  That difference in that amount of time can be staggering.

Step 1) get pre approved by having your credit pulled and giving basic info.  Step 2) search for and find a house.  Step 3) get real numbers and lock in a rate.  Step 4) submit your offer.  At some point in there, I’m sure the inspection happens.  I imagine between step 3 and 4…but unsure.  Also can speak to subsequent steps yet.

If you have additional questions that I might ask my lender, agent, or inspector, feel free to post.  I’ll try to remember to clarify things with them during the process.",finance,1645668277.0
personalfinance,Property Taxes + Mortgage/Personal Loan - Question Help,"Hey guys, I have a question about the two subjects mentioned above.

I'm married, I live with my wife in Miami, Florida, and we've been looking for a house since November last year. The initial plan was to give $250,000 in cash to use as down payment, and finance the remaining amount. But the housing market has been crazy for a while, and the only way for us to get our offers valuable, was to make cash offers. Finally, we found a house with the help of my father in law by giving us the cash needed to win the bid. The house offer was $650,000.

My two questions are:

1. How are the property taxes calculated in Margate, Florida? Do Broward County consider the value of the property at its market value ($580,000), the value that was paid for ($650,000) or the value is taken from their appraisal of the property for the year? And what would be the % to pay annually?
2. We need to repay to my father in law $400,000. I guess that we would need to take a personal loan? Which means the interest rate would be very bad for us comparing the interest rate for the purchase of a first house, right?

SunPower: They did a great job explaining everything and the salesperson I spoke to was very pleasant, but the price seems high.  


Green Power Energy: I was hoping the Price/Watt from Green Power Solar would be lower - I got the best feeling overall from them. Is it worth asking for a different panel option to bring the price down?  


Ad Energy (SunPower): Seems like they install only SunPower but at a significantly lower price.

I believe that because of the price instability, war in Russia, the belief that inflation is transitory (given oil prices are going to surge) , we will see moderated rate hikes, something the market may not have priced.

If they tighten to much which I think will be very hesitant to do so… they will further thank the market. Therefore long duration tech and growth may see a bounce in price. In fact I heard a few people on Bloomberg talk about buying profitable tech

CryptoCurrency,Why The US Dollar is Valuable and Bitcoin isn't.,"A month ago, I posted what I thought were the reasons that you might not want to buy this dip, as the favorable market conditions for crypto, in general, were disappearing, and were unlikely to resurface for somewhere between 2-10 years, so all cryptocurrency should expect to see a steady decline for at least the next 24 months, and much of it may become completely worthless, because it's completely worthless.

Say what you will about United States debt, the FED's unchecked money printing (recently because of the pandemic.  It's not like they go on printing sprees often, or ever, really, as inflation has been their entire focus since the 80s, under the leadership of longtime chairman, Alan Greenspan), but The United States makes stuff, and it makes stuff that people in The United States want, and people outside The United States want.  

The United States is also a place, filled with stuff, and people around the world want to come to this place, and see our stuff.

And, to buy our stuff and see our stuff, they need to give us something, and so they use the currency of their country, or the stuff they have, to buy our currency and pay us for our stuff.

Bitcoin exists nowhere.  Bitcoin has no stuff.  It was invented out of thin air, by a person (or persons), and the only thing that gives it value is people's fear that it might be valuable, and the fear of missing out.

All the things I hear people who are in the Bitcoin cult telling me when I speak the truth about their ""money"" is what is actually behind their motivation for buying crypto and proselytizing its virtue to everyone they can.

And now, the fear shifts to ""oh shit, what if it isn't valuable?  Then what?""

Cut your losses, kids.  This whole farce is about to fall flat.

In the last crypto winter, Ethereum, went from $2,000 to $100. Note that this was Ethereum which wasn’t considered as a « shitcoin » by most even at the time.

We know that the top is in. The Fed is tightening. We have liquidity being pulled back in the face of a massive bubble with people using margins etc.

CryptoMarkets,"Bitcoin Slumps Below $35k, Crypto In Freefall As Russia Declares War","On the night of February 24, the Russian Federation began military operations against Ukraine. Many Crypto medias are located there, describing the terrible occasion.[Bitcoin (BTC)](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) and the broader cryptocurrency market have entered yet another sharp correction as Putin announced a ‘military operation’ in Ukraine. The broader cryptocurrency market is down 5.35% losing another $100 billion of investors’ wealth.

**How do crypto exchanges operate in such situations? What are the chances that exchanges will block access to citizens of the Russian Federation?**

CryptoMarkets,The COMPETES act is less serious for Crypto than what some people are making it out to be,"[TLDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBOVAFoCp4&amp;t=19s)  
Honestly, it's baffling to see some news articles that are posting that the United States treasury has the capability to prohibit any sort of Cryptocurrency transaction or freeze Crypto wallet accounts. It is simply impossible for the U.S treasury to yield that kind of control over any Cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

What Can They Do?

The most they can do is provide a legal notice to a bank or Cryptocurrency exchanged (Based in the U.S) to freeze your assets, if they think you are involved in illegal activities such as money laundering, scamming or ransomware attacks. The government cannot do jackshit if you have your Crypto in a decentralized wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, there are around 27 Million Americans, or 8.3% of the population that own Cryptocurrencies. It is just unfeasible for the government to individually target all of their bank accounts or assets if they are going for Crypto as a whole, which is barely mentioned in the provision.

&amp;#x200B;

The Prohibition Does Not Target Crypto

r/CryptoCurrency \- The COMPETES act is less serious for Crypto than what some people are making it out to be

No Mention of Cryptocurrencies

&amp;#x200B;

The main prohibition is more likely to be focused on Banks rather than Cryptocurrencies as Criminal transactions are only 0.15% of all Crypto transactions. The Feds aren't dumb, they know this.

&amp;#x200B;

They're already spying on you

For the apparent clause that allows spying.... Well you're late. The U.S government has been spying on you for as long as you've been existing and this bill is going to be very insignificant in that regard. Moreover, anyone can ""spy"" on you already through blockchain explorers, but the thing that matters is, they don't know who is behind each wallet

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: The clause of the bill that people are freaking out over is largely irrelevant towards Cryptocurrencies, and Crypto holders who don't hold their wealth in an exchange are still unaffected. So, should you be concerned about this bill? Absolutely, it is still a clear overreach and a few people can still be affected. But should you panic like all media is telling you to? Absolutely not. No government can freeze or control Crypto transactions.",cryptocurrency,1645701947.0

I've never had a credit card in my name, nor have I taken out any loans. I make all of my payments through my checking account. Now I'm hoping to get started so I can build enough credit before I'm 45 an unable to get a mortgage. I have a lot of questions on the situation, but advice on any of the individual components is much appreciated. Here goes:

\-What does someone in my position do to get started? I'm guessing that getting a credit card is one of the early steps, but I'm not really sure what to look for or if there are ""entry-level"" cards. But are there other activities to start building credit that I can do on top of that (or before if it will get me better card options)? What kind of benefits can I expect to qualify for with cards in this range?

\-I'm pretty sure that having no credit history will add limitations on what type of credit card I can get, but I don't know what to expect on that front. High interest rate? Higher cash balance? High annual fee? Are there min/max values to avoid going past?

\-And while we're on the topic, how is credit card interest applied? If a card has an interest rate of 20%, and I spend $100 on that card in one month, will my bill for that month be $120? 

\-Finally, once I get a card, what do I do with it? Obviously, the goal is to spend and pay it back not miss payments. But are there other ways to help maximize the impact on my credit score?

I thought soon-to-be retirees would have the same goals for their retirement funds as I would for money I plan to spend in the next 5-8 years. Figured it'd be a safe-ish way to see some return without resorting to bargain basement interest rates.

Looking at the behavior of the fund over the past few years relative to the S&amp;P 500, I'm beginning to second-guess my decision.

In 2019, the S&amp;P grew 30%, then dropped 32% in the first quarter of 2020.

In 2019, FQIFX grew 20%, then dropped 28% in the first quarter of 2020.

In the second half of 2021, the S&amp;P grew 14%, and has since dropped 13%.

In the second half of 2021, FQIFX grew 4%, and has since dropped 8.5%.

So this comparatively ""conservative"" investment has managed 33-66% of the market's gains and 66-80% of its losses. Why would anyone choose this , since you're still seeing the lion's share of the market's volatility right up until retirement at the same time that you sacrifice half your gains?

Obviously, I'm not going to sell the dip; I'll stay the course. I don't need the money now and over 5-8 years, I'm confident I'll make a few bucks.

But my question is, as I look ahead towards retirement, is there a ""conservative"" asset allocation that can more effectively cut losses without totally sacrificing gains?

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin Might Need a Rebrand,"Neal Freyman - Morning Brew

Bitcoin is often referred to by its loyalists as “digital gold”—a safe haven asset you can rely upon when things get hairy around the world.

Well, things are really hairy, and bitcoin is [failing its test](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/23/the-case-for-bitcoin-as-digital-gold-is-falling-apart.html).

*How do we know bitcoin’s not behaving like digital gold?* Because we know what actual gold is doing, and it’s been going up. Gold prices are hovering near eight-month highs, and last week gold gained for seven straight trading sessions.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, continued to fall after Russia invaded Ukraine. Down 23% in 2022, its performance this year is even worse than the major US stock indexes’, which themselves have been pummeled due to concerns about Fed rate hikes and the war in Eastern Europe.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this

Because bitcoin a) is independent from any government or monetary system and b) has a limited supply, its advocates have considered it a hedge against factors that could hit stocks, like inflation or Putin invading a neighboring country.

Zoom out: While bitcoin hasn’t behaved like gold, it has behaved more like something else: a [tech stock](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/the-case-for-digital-gold-unravels-as-bitcoin-s-plunge-deepens).

CryptoCurrency,How to play the current state of the market. Level-headed guide from my 8 years in this market.,"Do you need to sell, hodl, buy?

I'll give you my best answer from my 8 years in crypto, and my 15+ years in the stock market.

# 1- What are your original targets, goals, and strategies?

The first question you need to ask yourself, is what was your original goal for your investment.

This is gonna be different for everyone.

a. Did you play a high risk game, of more than you can afford to lose?

b. Did you play it safe with some play money?

c. Did you have long term goals?

d. Do you have short term goals, and income generating trades?

In many cases, you'll have a hybrid of those.

Some long term money in, and some short term.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2- In what scenarios do you need to think more about selling, buying, hodling?

""a"" is a scenario where you may have to consider cutting losses. Especially if you're just in for a short term play. Keep in mind that while you may be selling a bottom, you just don't know if this could go lower.

If you can't afford going lower, even if it's short term, sell.

If you are more in case ""b"" or ""c"", where you are in it for a more long term play, then there's no need to panic on short term geopolitical panic, and narratives. Keep hodling. It's just another down in the long term rollercoaster.

We've had war in Syria, the Crimea invasion, Covid, Evergrande defaulting, the fear the SEC would go after all alts, Mt. Gox getting shut down, the ban on China's miners, etc...

All those blew over, and Bitcoin bounced back in a shorter time than people expected.

When everyone is panicking and selling, it's usually the most opportune time to make money.

While it won't be true every time, it will be true more often than not. So in the long run, following that strategy should make you more wins than losses.

With markets, you don't make money by following the herd. And you usually lose money when you make emotional decisions.

# Whatever you do, don't make an emotional call. Your decision should be part of a calculated plan, and not relying on the expectation of a scenario going perfectly your way.

# 3- Understand the long term market.

Understand that crypto is not the same as stocks.

The core market psychology is the same, but crypto is the first market to have set algorithms and tokenomics functioning in the asset. So it's not purely based on market psychology or speculation.

There is actually some math behind this.

Furthermore, the market is dictated and is following a single asset, and a single algorithm: Bitcoin.

The most important part of Bitcoin is the mining, and cyclical halving. That's what dictates it's long term core tokenomics, and consequentially the whole crypto market.

As long as people continue to believe in Bitcoin, and it continues to dominate the market, and the adoption is growing, those long term dynamics will continue to dominate the market long term.

Other markets:

Keep in mind what long term world markets have to deal with. We have very high inflation worldwide. We have to deal with the consequences of covid and businesses being hurt.

At the same time, we are potentially entering a post covid phase, or a phase where we may simply accept to live with covid, as businesses return to normal and can start to recover.

# 4- Understand the current short term market situation.

Crypto has been increasingly following the stock market.

But don't be fooled, it's not a 1:1 correlation. It's been closer to a 0.6 correlation, with brief moments of high correlation, and still some moments of low correlation and even inverse relation.

&amp;#x200B;

The two leading narratives spooking all markets are Russia and the inflation/Fed rates combo.

The latter is likely priced in, because we already know the target rates for 2022: 0.9%. And for 2024: close to 2%. We already know the Fed is pivoting in a more hawkish approach since the last meeting. What we don't know is more the smaller details of the roadmap.

&amp;#x200B;

Russia is the current panic factor for markets.

The bearish case: the conflict could potentially spread to a more serious scale involving not just Ukraine, and may become a NATO conflict.

The bullish case: the conflict is not gonna spread to other countries. The full invasion of Ukraine is now being priced in, and the worst may have already happened for markets. The market will soon move on, as the uncertainty element is gone, and bounce back as business continue to re-open in a world accepting to live with covid.

Depending on what you believe more, is up to you.",cryptocurrency,1645723242.0

I want a 2 bedroom apartment even though I will be living by myself because I want to have an office as I'll be working from home most of the week. I've found a couple apartments I really like, the rent listed on Zillow is between $1,500 to $1,700. Utilities aren't included, I asked my friend that has an apartment and they said I should expect at least $300-400 minimum a month, so I've just been planning for $500.

&amp;#x200B;

What else should I be planning for? How much should I save in my savings account vs. putting into my 401k? (4% match from employer) I want to make sure I'm putting money away for retirement but how much should that be? What's an average monthly grocery bill for a single person?

u/Successful-Whole4307 [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t0fov5/comment/hy9neko/):
&gt; Wasn't crypto supposed to be a trustless, decentralized peer to peer payment system?

Both highlight the same idea: the point of crypto is P2P payments. Crypto has many purposes other than as a payment system. But I think this is a good opportunity to discuss this potential use or purpose of crypto.

IMHO: the point of crypto is removing middlemen, and the main middlemen to remove for Bitcoin are in the FED, not in VISA or MasterCard.

However, VISA and MasterCard might be middlemen to remove with crypto as well. This seems to be a somewhat general perception, as one could assume from previous comments and the upvotes to u/Dinafem_shib's [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/t0fov5/comment/hy9gjdn/).

Let's give that a second thought: imagine that any shop or business with physical presence, e.g. a restaurant, accepts crypto payments. Would you pay with your crypto wallet disclosing your public address and all your transparently public transactions with that wallet? Is this the mainstream adoption that you want?

Paying with a card allows the card companies to have that information, which is not great, but at least limits who has that information, the middleman is a firewall as well. Other than that, paying with cash is the least revealing approach.

investing,Coinbase posts big revenue beat but expects trading volume to fall in Q1,"Article: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/coinbase-coin-earnings-q4-2021-.html

&gt;Coinbase reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates after the bell on Thursday. Shares bounced around after the report. They were down about 5% after hours before the call with analysts.

&gt;Here are the key numbers:

&gt;Earnings per share (EPS): $3.32, versus $1.85 expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts
&gt;Revenue: $2.5 billion, versus $1.94 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

&gt;The company predicted that retail Monthly Transaction Users (MTUs) and total trading volume would be lower in Q1 2022 compared to Q4 2021. Coinbase attributed the change to decreased crypto asset volatility and a 20% decrease in crypto market capitalization quarter-to-date. It said the declining market cap is driven by macroeconomic factors like geopolitical instability and the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling a tightening of financial conditions.

&gt;Coinbase expects subscriptions and services revenue to be lower in Q1 because of crypto asset price declines.

&gt;In the fourth quarter, MTUs grew to 11.4 million in Q1, up from 7.4 million in Q3. That came after Coinbase saw a decline in MTUs between Q2 and Q3.

&gt;It also saw net income double quarter-over-quarter to $840 million in Q4. That’s several times the net income Coinbase saw in Q4 2020, when it reported $177 million.

&gt;The report comes after major cryptocurrencies saw a weak month in December despite an overall explosion in value in 2021. Investors blamed the slow end to the year on concerns about cryptocurrency’s energy consumption and on macroeconomic factors like the rise of the omicron Covid variant.

&gt;Coinbase warned shareholders in the previous quarter that its stock should be considered a long-term investment since its business is “volatile.”

&gt;That’s been demonstrated in recent weeks as major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin fell amid concerns that Russian troops would invade Ukraine. That’s led some analysts to question the idea that bitcoin could act as a safe-haven currency in times of geopolitical instability.

&gt;Coinbase warned in its letter to shareholders that 2022 will continue to have a fair amount of uncertainty for its business.

&gt;“We enter 2022 with even more unknowns which make our business all the more difficult to forecast,” the company wrote, pointing to “global macroeconomic headwinds” on top of unpredictable crypto asset prices, rising interest rates and inflation. But, it said, it sees increased opportunities and adoption of cryptocurrency.

Personal take: $COIN is a bit of an oddball in terms of growth stock. On one hand it suffers all the volatility associated with the cryptocurrency market, but on the other hand it's got a P/E ratio that is *half* of $AAPL. It is also investing in ancillary revenue channels beyond trading fees, which is good for diversification but is still fundamentally tied to the staying power and public interest of the crypto space.

Bitcoin,Results of the charity matching campaign,"In December, /r/Bitcoin partnered with [The Giving Block](https://thegivingblock.com/) to do a charity matching campaign where anyone who donated BTC using a special link would have their donation matched. See [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/r5okqf/rbitcoin_will_be_matching_12btc_of_your_btc/) for more details.

I'm happy to report that the ~12 BTC dedicated to the match was completely exhausted, which means that generous /r/Bitcoin users donated over 12 BTC! Thank you to:

 * Everyone who donated in this campaign.
 * The original contributors to the ad fund from many years ago, whose ~$300 in donations turned into over $650,000 in charitable contributions thanks to Bitcoin.
 * The Giving Block for doing almost all of the actual work involved in running this campaign.

**List of charities that received matching funds**

Which charities received matching funds was entirely determined by the donors. If you donated using the campaign link while the match was active (from when I posted about the campaign through almost all of December), then your donation was matched. Because I perceived it as something of a conflict of interest, I did not personally donate any amount using the match.

Price-wise, the timing turned out to be pretty favorable, luckily: Taken in aggregate, the ~12 BTC used for matching was ""sold"" at a price of roughly $54,600.

Because many of the charities were very local, I rounded the match amounts to the nearest $100 to help protect the donors' privacy. The total match amount was $664,202.47.

investing,The second biggest opportunities in buying the dip in recent years.,"First of all, the image is now allowed here thus if anyone wants to see the charts to for the link

[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/t0odtg/the\_second\_biggest\_opportunities\_in\_buying\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/t0odtg/the_second_biggest_opportunities_in_buying_the/)

The first biggest opportunity was obliviously the starting period of pandemic. I believe a lot of savvy investors had seized that opportunity. Here, I believe, we are facing what could be the second biggest opportunity. 

There are two big dark clouds hovering over the market, one of which is the high inflation and the other is this war panic regarding Ukraine. 

I’d like to shed some light on both. Firstly, our currently high inflation, in my opinion, this is a classical macroeconomic event heavy involving misjudgment caused by Central banks worldwide (lead by US Fed) which has been repetitiously occurring for a number of times. 

Our currently high inflation situation resembles, in many ways, the Great Inflation happened in 1960-1980 which was originated from an excessive growth in the supply of money from US Fed accompanied by the by-then US President Johnson’s Great Society Initiative. During that time, under the impact of energy crisis the US Fed still continued to assist the administration to achieve what called maximum employment initiative with issuing huge amount of debts and deliberately keeping low interest rates, which eventually lead to the 1960-1980 great inflation.                 

A close study of that great inflation period would find us many similarities between that time and ours. What our time has experienced is almost the same thing except for the pandemic with trillions of dollars printed by central banks and the energy crisis caused by the sudden shift to renewable energy called by all the governments worldwide.

A foreseeable consequence based on the experience in the 1960 Great Inflation would be a much higher interest rates compared with prior years, the important question is just by how much will the interest rates go. 

Clearly, in both instances (ours and the 1960 Great Inflation) we could see the misjudgment of the US Feds. Reminder you that our current Fed chair only recently (in 2020) withdrawn his original idea about inflation was transitory and brought forward around 2 years in terms of hiking interest rate (only a year ago they expected the hiking would be in 2024 including Australian RBA). 

With the expectations of higher interest rate, logically we are having a lower stock market. However, as a long-term investor who only invest in best quality stocks, I’m not that concerned, more importantly we are not in 1980s because of many different changes nowadays. 

But Let me show you the following stock trend after 1960 Great Inflation when the by-then US Fed Paul Volcker conquered the great inflation by hiking the interest rates to as high as 19%. Interestingly, when interest rates reached all time high at almost 19%, the stock market had actually bottomed. But it took a number of years until S&amp;P500 recached the bottom, after which the market started 2 decades bull trend. Therefore, our biggest question would be how long would it take until our stock price reached the bottom (meaning when is the time to buy the dip), is our market going to be failing for around a decade until it reached its bottom like the Great Inflation period? I think the answer is no. 

A thorough thinking on 1960 Great Inflation and the 1982’ beginning of bull market would give use some clues on how inflation has correlated with the interest rate and stock market. Based on various charts in this post, one would find the stock market eventually bottomed when the interest rate peaked with correspondingly lower inflation (also unemployment peaked at 11%) in 1982.  

A deeper look at that time and background gives me the answer that our situation largely depends on how long it takes for the Fed to realize their misjudgment and revise their policies.

It took the former Fed and administration a decade to realize their misjudgment in 1960-1980 and remediated their policies. In contrast, it took 2 years for current US Fed revised their original thinking and now they are already for hiking. This is a good signal for us. 

Additionally, employment goes very well and we have lots of new technologies to tackle energy crisis such as EVs and solar power when comparing with the 1960s-1980s. As a result, I’m actually more optimistic than many peers about our current situation due to the above factors. As a matter of fact, this situation is the one I’ve been waiting and prepared for a year as I’ve been selling many high PE but low-quality stocks to accumulate cash for this big dip. But I’m still holding my many-year low PE high cash flow holdings like Apple, Berkshire due to the reason that they are the best ones and most likely they would never drop to my purchase price when I made after the start of this pandemic.

Second dark cloud we are facing is the war panic or concern, it’s a sensitive topic but actually, it’s what I want to discuss is very short. Yes, and there will be energy concern regarding this, and also there is potential risk of an expanding war. But as many great investors including Warren Buffett who experienced WW2 and many others has already told us don’t afraid of buying in war time.",finance,1645744974.0

He said the best rate he could get for that was 3.34%... Also, it would change our monthly payments from \~$2800 up to \~$3500.  We would also be paying $23K in interest at the fixed rate per year vs. $9000 in interest for the variable rate if nothing changed.

personalfinance,Is it possible a fraudulent collections company could access a legitimate collection and pretend that they own the debt and try to get me to pay them? Everything about this feels off.,"Yesterday, a credit collections agency called my parents home phone and my Grandmothers home phone (not sure how they would get that information). **I will get to this, but it is important to note, it turns out I do owe a high interest loan company money that I did not pay the full balance of, and given the high interest rate it is now about $2,500.**

They were somewhat threatening in the phone calls, saying that if I didn't respond within an hour I would be served papers for a court case.

Right off the bat, there were red flags:

* The company that they called from does not exist on the internet
* The phone numbers they called from as well as the phone number they said to call do not show up in any google search.

I called the number they gave today, and they said I owe this amount of money and if I don't pay they will take me to court for intention to defraud a bank by taking a lone with the intention of not paying them back. (I think this is a big stretch because I made a ton of payments on this, before moving to a new house and I didn't notice that they stopped pulling money from my account every other week to pay back the loan. I had a rough year or two and didn't take my credit and loan obligations very seriously.

So I call the company and they want me to confirm the last 4 digits of my social security company before they would tell me anything. They told me the first 6 digits so I figured they already had my information. I asked them how I could verify that they were a legitimate business, since they didn't even tell me anything about what I owed until I gave them that information.

After giving the last 4 digits, the woman told me the collections was from a company that I did take a loan from. I told her I would call her back once I looked at my credit report. I saw that there was a collection on my report from Ad Astra as of 2/1/2022. The company name they gave me was United Firm. No record of this anywhere on the internet.

When I called back and asked them to send me some sort of documentation, the woman said they can't do that. When I asked why they don't have a website, she gave me some convoluted response and said they can't have one based on the nature of their business (red flag).

I have since cleaned up my finances, and wanted this to over with so I asked what I could pay to have this taken care of. Initially it was $2,000 and they offered a payment plan. I said I could pay $1,500 today and she said that wasn't enough. She offered dual payments as another option. I wanted to take care of it and said the most I can possibly pay is $1700. She said she had to check with her supervisor, and then after 30 seconds she said they authorized it.

I said I wanted some sort of documentation from them that showed an agreement where I would pay the amount and they would contact the credit agencies and say the debt was paid. She said that department was out for the day, and that they could send me something in the morning and I could pay then.

**After thinking about all of this, I have some questions. They had my parents address, yet didn't send any letter. They also had my email address but didn't send any emails. When I asked about that, she said the previous owner of the debt had already done that, so they didn't have to. She said if they sent me an itemized summary of the amount owed, they would have to take me to court. That seems crazy for a legitimate business.**

**It is also a red flag that the name of their agency is different from the collection company that actually does own my debt based on my credit report. Ad Astra has a website and is a legitimate business.**

**Is it possible a fraudulent company could access a legitimate collection and pretend that they own it and try to get me to pay them? Everything about this feels off. The only reason I believed them is because they knew the name and amount of a real debt.**

They didn't even have my cell phone number. The two numbers they called were landlines registered to my parents and grandmother that could be accessed via a search on Whitepages.

personalfinance,Questions about taxes and starting retirement account + a 3-fund portfolio,"Background info: 






I am a single 25 year old college student living in the U.S. I do not have any debts, and my expenses are covered by my parents so long as I report them, keep them to a minimum and get high grades as I continue towards graduation (I make a point of doing all of these things). They will also support me in grad school, which I will go to and complete. I worked a part time job last year from (quit in Dec.) and grossed 9.8k. I did not set up a 401k while I worked there, and my employer did not set one up for me. I also earned about 1.8k doing an assortment of odd jobs for friends/family. I am currently a full time student and unemployed, and I will probably be unemployed until I graduate in a year as my class load will be really high all the way through. I also had about 21.5k in the bank before I worked these jobs. 






My questions: 






**Question 1.** From my understanding, my gross income for 2021 was 11.6k- under both the federal and my state's minimum income thresholds for filing taxes. Am I correct in this? It just seems like I am missing something and I do not want to make a mistake here. I would like to set up a retirement account as soon as possible (like, in the next day). How will this affect setting up a retirement account? 






**Question 2.** What kind of retirement account should I set up? Would a traditional IRA be the best choice because I could be able to roll it over into a future 401k? Also, can I still contribute to it with last year's earnings? If I can, can I max out my '21 contibutions with my last year earnings, and then use whatever of last year's earnings are left to make contributions toward my '22 max? Can I use my earnings from odd jobs to contribute to the retirement account? 






**Question 3.** In addition to setting up a retirement account in the next day, I would like to set up a 3-fund index fund portfolio. I netted around 9.9k last year (before considering my income tax question above), and I would like invest as much of that in a retirement account as possible. So in total, I have about 30k in the bank- should I keep an emergency fund of about 2.5k, and invest the rest? Will the bank halt me from investing more than a certain amount in a short period tomorrow (like as an automated security measure)? 






**Question 4.** Potentially a really ridiculous question: is there any merit to the idea of setting up different funds with different services? For example, setting up my retirement account with Fidelity, and my 3-fund with Vanguard? Or taking it further, and doing something like retirement with Vanguard, stocks with Fidelity, bonds with Schwab, etc. I ask this because of the potential of these services suffering a hack/cyberattack.

I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this question, but I am in the process of selling a property. The proceeds of that sale will be used in the construction of a new home. However, the usage of the money won't happen for at least 3-6 months. The total sum will be between $500K - $750k. I mention that only in case there are minimal or maximums to consider.

I want to park the money somewhere, where It could earn some interest. I don't want to gamble it in the stock/crypto market. It's dark times at the moment. 

I need to make sure the money is liquid so I can withdraw it when needed. I know Marcus and Amex Savings give about .50% interest. Not a whole lot.

solar,Project Solar Review Part 4 (Energizing and Final thoughts),"TLDR: My experience with Project Solar lasted 7 and a half months. Approximately 2.5 months of that was due to delays on their part. The process had bumps at every step from planning, installation, inspection, and PTO. It isn't as seamless as they portray on their website. Their customer service is satisfactory and they always respond to emails and calls, although specific questions took a while to get an answer. I underestimated the installation process, but that would be the same with any DIY option. The silver lining was the price. I estimate the cost as 35% less than local installers. My 6.4 kW system was estimated as $8,000 after-tax credit. Overall, I recommend Project Solar as long as they improve their process (growing pains) and keep their prices low.

Check my previous posts:

[Part 3 Installation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarDIY/comments/q5l5h8/project_solar_part_3_installation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I left off with my installation complete. I just needed to get inspected by the city and have the energy company install a net meter.

**Inspection**

I originally scheduled an inspection on October 6 and put in the comment to come before noon because I wouldn't be around after due to my work. They waited until the day of and said to reschedule because they couldn't come that early. I rescheduled on October 11, and the inspector said I didn't need to be home for the inspection (can't blame Project solar for that 5-day delay). The inspector said the installation looked good, but it didn't match the plans that were submitted. I just needed to adjust the plans and resubmit. The plans had some breakers in the main disconnect that didn't need to be there. I sent that information to Project Solar. I followed up with Project Solar a few days later and they said they used an outside company to create my plans. I talked to that company to give them details about my installation. 15 days later they sent me the updated plans. Project Solar said they do not use that company anymore. I applied for another inspection and a different inspector came out. He said we needed to move the solar breaker to the opposite side of the bus where the main power comes in. This was the response from Project Solar ""Sometimes we oversimplify our instructions, saying the PV breaker needs to be at the bottom of the bussing. The NEC requirements say that it needs to be the farthest point from the breaker/feeders on the bussing."" It would normally be a quick fix, but our wire was too short so I had to do another lowes trip and spend another $50 on longer wires. We passed the next inspection and got our permit on November 10. If I had been given the proper plans and instructions from the beginning, I could have passed the first inspection and saved myself about 4 weeks and $50.

**PTO (Permission to Operate)**

After we had the cities approval, Project Solar applied for the net metering with my energy company. On November 17, a week after the city approval, I received an email from my energy company saying the application was submitted. For the next month, I received several emails from my energy company asking for more documentation or corrections to the application. On December 19, I got another correction email and forwarded it to Project Solar. They said the energy company approved my application on December 14 and I just need the wait for them to inspect and switch the meter. Either that wasn't true or the holidays messed something up because it wasn't until January 5 that the energy company sent an email saying I was pending inspection within 10 business days. On January 13 the energy company came out and gave me PTO. So it was another 4-8 weeks (however you want to look at it) of delays due to Project Solar not filling out the forms correctly.

**Energizing the system**

The Project Solar team said they would walk me through energizing the system and making sure all the Enphase microinverters were working and communicating with the app. They were quick to respond by setting up an appointment. I asked if they were available on Monday (MLK day) and they said yes. Unfortunately, they messaged me back saying they were not available that day so I had to schedule for Wednesday. Not a huge deal, but another 2 days delay for a process that kept dragging. On Wednesday we turned the system on and connected it to the app and my wifi. The microinverters weren't connecting and he said it sometimes takes hours especially if the system has been off for a long time, which it had. He said he'd check with me the next day. I did some research and it looked like the grid profile was not set up correctly causing the microinverter connection issue. I emailed the project solar rep and he had never heard of a grid profile... But he would research it. The next day he said that the grid profile was the issue and it had been originally set up incorrectly. He said I might have accidentally changed it by accessing the Enphase toolkit. Regardless, on January 20 the system was on and operating normally! The only thing I have left to do is clean the panels and install the critter guard.

**Cost**

6.4 kW system

Project solar total = $10,752

Materials = $893

Tools = $1,086

Total = $12,731 (not including the Federal Tax credit)

I'll be using the tools for future projects so if you don't include those as an expense, and with my estimated tax credit, **the final cost is just over $8,000.** Assuming my electric bill is 2,000 a year, I should **break even in less than 5 years.** I won't know for sure for about a year once I see how efficient the system operates and how much electricity I use.

**Hours**

Approximate hours spent on this project:

Taking photos - 2 hours

Plan correction due to vents - 6

Emails- 8

Installation- 80

**Nearly 100 hours.** This is going to vary a lot. I could have saved a lot more hours if I was more experienced and had more help.

January 20- System energized and operational

From start to finish about **7 and a half months.**

**Conclusion**

From initial deposit to collecting the sun's energy this project lasted about 7 and a half months. It cost me about $8,000 and 100 hours to complete. I could have paid an extra $2,000 to have Project Solar install it. I like that I was able to do it and know my roof won't leak, but it was a lot of work and may have been worth it to pay for the installation. For comparison, a local company quoted me $12,300 (including tax credit).

Some of the delays were from me (3 weekends of installation), but a lot of them were from Project Solar. On a phone call, they said their projects are usually 4 months. Mine was almost double that. I didn't want to do the installation until the Fall, so I didn't mind the delays pre-installation. The inspection and PTO delays that lasted from October to January were a little frustrating. If the process was as seamless as they portray I would say it is totally worth going with Project Solar. I told them about the issues I had during the process and they said they have already fixed most of them.

After considering the costs versus benefits, I would recommend using Project Solar. I saved nearly 35% by going with them which reduced my break-even point by about 3 years. If you're not handy and not willing to do the DIY option, I can't recommend them to install because I didn't go through that process. Maybe someone else who has can comment. I would consider it with other quotes.",energy,1645771553.0

stocks,"If you have 100K, what diversification strategy is best?","In the context of the current era, the most serious inflation in 40 years, and the Fed raising interest rates is imminent, I have a diversified investment plan, and everyone is welcome to give their opinions.  


First of all, please don't put your eggs in the same basket. I think we should implement a diversified investment strategy, the greatest investment strategy of the 20th century.

From a long-term investment perspective, the best diversification strategies are comprehensive, including diversification against inflation, financial crises, and social unrest.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, we see that the stock market is not always safe in times of social unrest, inflation and financial crises. At this time, gold and energy are safer and more reliable than the stock market, and gold is the best safe-haven currency. Therefore, it is always best to invest some of your funds in the gold and energy markets.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, there are the following strategies:

1. We can selectively invest 30% of our capital in the stock market. In the stock market, we still follow a diversified investment strategy. Including technology stocks, energy stocks, consumer stocks, financial stocks, medical stocks, etc., you can refer to MSFT, AAPL, CO, TSLA, XOM, etc. (it is best to buy after a big drop);

2. Invest 30% of the funds to directly purchase gold and crude oil. These investments cannot be replaced by gold stocks and crude oil stocks, because stocks still represent corporate behavior, and we should invest directly in the commodity itself;

3. Invest 20% in mutual funds and ETFs, my explanation is: the fund itself is a diversified portfolio, but when the market goes up, stocks will always be more profitable than funds. Buying some funds is mainly for the volatility and downside risks that may arise in the bear market.

4. If you invest in the current form, please reserve 20% of the funds as a safety reserve. When the financial crisis hits, this part of the money is the money you buy again.

&amp;#x200B;

Risks in the market are diverse, you can never predict when a risk will occur, and you never know where a risk will occur.

Analyze the actual situation and apologize for any inaccuracies.

Wish you all the best.",finance,1645772133.0

stocks,Fed’s Waller wants to leave door open for possible half-point rate hike on March 16,"The Federal Reserve should not rule out raising its policy interest rate by half of one percentage point on March 16, especially if incoming inflation and jobs data released before then show the economy is running “exceedingly hot,” said Fed Gov. Christopher Waller on Thursday.

The government will release two key inflation reports and a jobs report prior to the Fed meeting. The first of these key reports, the January reading of the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditure price index — will come early Friday morning.

“If…tomorrow’s PCE inflation report for January and jobs and CPI reports for February indicate that the economy is still running exceedingly hot, a strong case can be made for a 50-basis-point hike in March,” Waller said, in remarks to a conference on economic forecasting sponsored by the University of California, Santa Barbara.

“With the economy at full employment and inflation far above target, we should signal we are moving back to neutral at a fast pace, based on the performance of the economy, and a 50-basis-point hike would help do that,” he said.

# Inflation outlook

Waller said that all Americans “should be alarmed” by the latest consumer price inflation data, which showed inflation running at a 7.5% annual rate in January, a 40-year high.

The Fed governor said he was “alarmed about the level of inflation and a bit uncertain about how the near-term may play out,” but hopeful that supply-chain bottlenecks and shortages will begin to ease after June, and that inflation — with some help from the Fed — will come down significantly by year’s end.

Given this outlook, Waller said he now supports increasing the Fed’s policy interest rate by 100 basis points by the middle of the year, up to a target range of 1% to 1.25%.

This could be accomplished with four quarter-point hikes at each of the Fed’s next four meetings, he said.

But “front-loading” a 50-basis-point hike may be useful to convey the Fed’s determination to address high inflation, he said.

# Ukraine invasion’s effect on rate hikes

On Wednesday[, traders lowered their expectations of a half-point hike on March 16, ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/economic-impact-from-war-between-russia-and-ukraine-seen-as-limited-for-u-s-11645548528?mod=search_headline&amp;mod=article_inline)in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some other Fed officials expressed more caution about such a large initial hike.

Waller said it is possible that the state of the world will be different in the wake of the Ukraine attack and “that may mean that a more modest tightening is appropriate.”

“But that remains to be seen,” and the uncertainty may last beyond the March 16 meeting, he added.

Waller said that the Ukraine situation did not obviate the need to raise rates next month.

“We need to take the first step in March,” he said, adding that the geopolitical situation would be a factor in the pace of further rate hikes.

# Trimming the balance sheet

Waller also said he wanted the Fed to start to shrink its $9 trillion balance sheet no later than its July meeting.

Other Fed officials have not been as specific about the timing.

The Fed allows its balance sheet to shrink by letting maturing securities run off. During the last cycle, the Fed set monthly caps on the runoff that started small and then grew over time.

Waller said the caps can be larger in this cycle. At some point, the Fed will need to consider selling some of its mortgage-backed securities, but that is a decision for “down the road.” For now, Waller said only that the Fed shouldn’t cap the runoff of maturing MBS.

# Powell testimony

“These actions will get us into the second half of the year, when we will have six months of inflation data, and we can assess what the appropriate path will be for the rest of 2022,” Waller said.

If high inflation persists, Waller said he would mostly likely support continued hikes — and potentially at a faster pace.

Until recently, Waller was seen by Fed watchers as at the hawkish end of the spectrum of Fed officials.

But the doves on the Fed have shifted in his direction. Economists will be listening closely next Wednesday and Thursday when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies to lawmakers to see where the center of the committee stands on interest-rate policy.

personalfinance,How does my current financial plan sound?,"I'm really sorry for the long post!

I'm starting a new job as an engineer in two weeks. This will be my first job out of college and it requires me to move out so I have to budget accordingly. A lot of my numbers are estimations as I don't have the exact numbers. 

I will be making around $4500 monthly after taxes. 

About $1400 going into rent and utilities for a two bedroom apartment, since not many are available in my area. I plan on getting a roommate soon so I can split the cost down to $700.  That or move into an apartment complex which will be available in April that has a monthly rent of $1000.

In addition, I have to get a car soon but I'm assuming I'll be making monthly car payments of $300 that I will have to take care of. In addition, I'm guessing I'll be spending $150 on gas per month. From my college days, I didn't spend too much money on groceries as I bought things in bulk, so I think I won't spend more than $200 on food. 

So right now, that's around $2450 I'll have left over if I don't find a roommate or a cheaper apartment. 

I have student loans to take care of which are now at $21000. I absolutely have no idea how I'm going to approach that can of worms as repayment resumes in May but with the whole federal government thinking about forgiving student loans, I am unsure if I should start paying it off quickly and risk wasting money in case a portion or even all of the loans are forgiven, or wait only for nothing to happen with the interest building up. 

In terms of emergency fund, I will be contributing a portion of the money I have left over. My parents want to pay off the first month of rent so I plan on putting in the money that I was supposed to pay in housing into the emergency fund. So about $1400 at the end of the first month plus the amount that I would be allocating into it monthly. 

I also am getting a bonus of about $7500 before taxes but I don't want to touch that at all as I would have to pay it it all back if I leave the company or get fired before my 1 year anniversary at the company. If I do make it past that time, I want to dump it into repaying my student loans.  

Finally, I don't plan on staying at this job for too long. I want to move back home with my parents after I can safely cash in my bonus and secure a job nearby. My parents live in a HCOL area so I would imagine that the salaries are higher, especially when factoring in that I'll have some experience that I can use to negotiate my salary.  I would save a shit ton by not having to pay for food or rent, and I would be able to focus on paying off the remainder of my student loans, and after that focus on saving money for things like investing and a down payment.

MachineLearning,[R] The Shapley Value in Machine Learning,"**Abstract:**

Over the last few years, the Shapley value, a solution concept from cooperative game theory, has found numerous applications in machine learning. In this paper, we first discuss fundamental concepts of cooperative game theory and axiomatic properties of the Shapley value. Then we give an overview of the most important applications of the Shapley value in machine learning: feature selection, explainability, multi-agent reinforcement learning, ensemble pruning, and data valuation. We examine the most crucial limitations of the Shapley value and point out directions for future research.

**Paper:**

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05594](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05594)

**So what is the Shapley value?**

The  Shapley value tells you the value of each player in transferable  utility cooperative games and it satisfies useful desiderata such as  fairness and symmetry.

**How do people use the Shapley value in machine learning?**

It  is used for instance-level explanations, feature selection, data and  data silo valuation, ensemble pruning, reward allocation in multi-agent  RL.

**Can you be more specific?**

For example, you can  decompose an instance-level model prediction (payoff) and explain how  feature values (players) contributed to the model decision.

**Can you give another example?**

Another  example is data valuation, you want to know how individual data points  (players) contributed to the predictive performance of a model (payoff).

**Can you give one more example?**

A  third example is multi-agent reinforcement learning, agents (players)  that cooperate receive a global reward (payoff) which we want to  distribute. The Shapley value provides an allocation mechanism to  achieve this.

**What are the limitations of the Shapley value?**

It  takes factorial time (in the number of players) to compute it, because  of this people use approximations. Under these approximations, the  interesting properties such as symmetry do not hold. It is also  problematic to interpret the Shapley value when you are not an expert in ML and game theory.

**What are some interesting future research directions?**

There  are extensions of the Shapley value for pre-existing coalition  structure and overlapping coalitions of the players. In several machine  learning settings, these extensions could be useful e.g. in federated  learning the data owners might own the same data point.",technology,1645783068.0
CryptoCurrency,EU is proposing banning PoW mining. These other 3 industries are the top pollutants in the world and the EU is ignoring them.,"Sorry repost because the original was removed.

Here are the three worst pollutants in the world that we should be focusing on instead of cryptocurrency mining banning:

1. Fuel industry
One reason the fuel industry is causing so much harm is because we rely on energy and fuel for everyday tasks, from small things like charging our phones to big things like long-haul flights. We also need coal and oil to make products such as medicines and plastics. 

As population levels rise, we’re requiring more and more fuel for everyday life. It's estimated that the world consumed 100.3 million barrels of oil per day in 2019. To put this into perspective, our oil consumption in 2006 was 85 million per day. Can we sustain this growth in consumption? 

When all these fossil fuels are burned, it releases a mass amount of CO2 into the atmosphere – consequently warming up the world.

But it’s not just the atmosphere that’s suffering – the ocean is also feeling the impact. Oil spills can damage sea life substantially, poisoning fish and birds, destroying the insulation of fur-bearing animals, and reducing the water repellency of birds.  

What’s most worrying about this is that, throughout 2018, approximately 116,000 tonnes were spilt. Although this is a shocking amount, it is one of the lowest figures since records began in 1970.


2. Agriculture
Eating meat and dairy products is just a natural part of life, right? Well, sort of. The global population is constantly growing – and it’s more than the world can handle. At this point, we have to ask ourselves: can our world cope with our ever-growing consumption?

But why does meat farming cause so much harm to the environment? Well, agriculture accounts for a shocking 13-18% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Most (65%) of the agricultural emissions are methane and nitrous oxide, which mostly come from cows. 

Burning land for agriculture is an additional issue that we're facing. Destroying this land both increases CO2 emissions and removes trees that absorb CO2. 

This year, the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest grabbed people’s attention around the globe. Over a single month, 870 square miles were lost to fires – a rise of 278% compared to the same month last year – most of which was due to agriculture. 



3. Fashion industry
How can clothes be so environmentally destructive? Well, when you combine the fashion industry's CO2 emissions, and the mass of clothes waste that is dumped around the world, it’s a no-brainer. In fact, fashion production currently makes up 10% of humanity's carbon emissions.

We're not saying that this applies to all fashion, just ‘fast fashion’. Fast fashion refers to clothing made from cheap material – often containing microplastics. On top of this, the clothing is usually manufactured in Asian countries, where most factories run on coal and gas. 

Now that we're in the digital era, we have to take the delivery into account as well. The combined annual emissions of postal services in the US, such as FedEx, UPS, and the U.S. Postal Service is roughly equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 7 million cars.

stocks,Just Eat Takeaway - DD,"**Profile:** 

Just Eat Takeaway.com NV, is a company based in the Netherlands that provides an online food delivery service (Just Eat provide their own riders to deliver the food) and an online food delivery marketplace (a marketplace that allows restaurants to deliver food with their own riders for a fee). The Company focuses on connecting consumers and restaurants, and allows users to order food from nearby restaurants and have the food delivered to their homes.[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1) They operate in 4 key regions: North America (41% of Business), Northern Europe (26%), UK &amp; Ireland (23%), Southern Europe &amp; ANZ (10%). The company started solely as a marketplace, but has since evolved to provide their own service, while maintaining the original model as well. 

**Opportunity:**

Just Eat Takeaway has had a turbulent past year. Like many food delivery stocks, they benefited greatly during lockdowns as people were forced to stay at home and order food online rather than go to restaurants. This created a surge in demand for their services. Since then, there has been a culmination of macro-economic changes that directly affect profitability and performance of delivery companies: European delivery stocks dropping after the EU announced changes in regulation around gig workers, North American delivery stocks dropping after NYC and Canada imposed caps on commission[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn2), and a rising interest rate environment. The troubles don’t end here with TKWY as there is a market view that they overpaid for Grubhub and is overreaching by shifting focus away from their core EU hub. Additionally, there has been miscommunication on strategy with the CEO changing his mind on grocery delivery.[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn3) 

Since all of this Just Eat Takeaway has dropped 70% since the highs in October 2020 and perhaps the stock market is too pessimistic about it. At current levels, the stock is looking very attractive and there exists a possibility to purchase a company at a very low valuation. In this report, I lay out why despite all the downside, the stock is now a great buying opportunity. 

**Valuation:**

At current valuation, their EV is around 8.1bn Eur. In their annual report of 2020, management has mentioned that their 33% stake in the company iFood has received multiple offers including one for 2.3bn Eur[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn4). Assuming that it is still accurate, that puts the remaining value of the company at 5.8bn Eur. In 2021, the company paid 7.3bn USD for Grubhub, which in turn translates to 6.45bn Eur. Accounting for a current net debt position of 0.7bn Eur the current price puts the remaining operations of Just eat at -1.3bn Eur. **Meaning you are being paid to take on the European business with 16bn+ Eur GMV**. (GMV – gross merchandise value/volume, also referred to as GTV – gross transaction volume)

An argument can be made that recently these valuations for Grubhub and iFood are quite high and do not meet reality. If we assume a 60% reduction in value for both cases, that comes to a remaining EV of 4.6bn Eur for the entire European business. This still comes at the low end of its historic multiples. On the other hand, if the stake in iFood and/or Grubhub has since increased, valuation could be even cheaper. 

**Trading at historic low valuations:**

Just eat is trading at the same price it traded in May 2017. Since then, it has grown revenue from 166 million Eur to over 3 billion Eur and GMV from 1.3 billion to 28.2 billion Eur[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn5). It perhaps traded too highly in those previous periods, nonetheless, a return to a fraction of these valuations would present an opportunity to make returns of 100%+. It should also be noted that since then, a lot of M&amp;A has occurred, meaning shareholders have had their shares diluted. Thus, comparing the two valuations is not so straight forward and should be taken with some scepticism.

In Netherlands and Germany, the company has proved that it can generate 5% net adjusted EBITDA on GMV[\[6\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn6). If (and big if) they are able to achieve this steady state, then that would imply EBITDA of 800mn Eur on their European business. After 20% tax rate, that is 640mn Eur earnings assuming negligible D&amp;A and with current balance sheet debt holding at very low values. A conservation 10PE ratio would put that at 6.4bn which already is higher than the current market share at which the entire company is trading at right now (excluding iFoods). 

Long-term best-case scenario could include that GMV will continue to grow at mid teen digits[\[7\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn7) (assuming 15%) for 5 years –&gt; 1.15\^5= 200% over 5 years. Therefore, GMV would be around 56bn. A 4% Net Income margin would assume earnings of around 2.2bn Eur. 

It should be noted that this assumes they will be able to achieve the promised land of 5% adjusted EBITDA to GMV as well as no execution risk or any other risks involved. On the other hand, it is a conservative ratio potentially implying a higher valuation. 

Furthermore, as market trend moved from very bullish on food delivery companies and paying several multiples for GMV to now paying only a fraction for GMV, the trend could reverse, and these companies could see renewed upside. Trading at 1 GMV would imply a 300%+ upside. 

Such a recent large sell off in their stock could be proven to be an overreaction and a great opportunity to buy a company selling below intrinsic value. “Large amounts of money aren’t made by buying what everybody likes. They’re made by buying what everybody underestimates.” – Howard marks.

**Other Funds positions**

Cat Rock is particularly bullish on them with a sizeable position as well as Baupost[\[8\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn8). Cat Rock has released a few presentations with how they can unlock a huge amount of value by partnering with certain companies and tapping into the same day delivery market. Additionally, they propose the sale of Grubhub (the US part of operations)[\[9\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn9), and go into more depth on growth, app ratings, addressable market, independent restaurants, etc. 

**Other points, risks and bear case:**

1. The company is loss making 

a. As the company is focussing on growth, it currently is investing heavily and trying to grow market share and revenue. Management said long term goals is to achieve &gt;5% adjusted EBITDA margins on GMV. [\[10\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn10) For 2022, they are expect to come in the range of approx. -1.2% of GMV with this year being the biggest losses. For next year they are aiming at -0.6% to -0.8% EBITDA margin to GMV. It is still to be seen if they can achieve their long-term profitability. This is perhaps the most significant downside as you are paying for promised earnings in the future rather than current earnings with other companies. 

2. It is trading at an elevated PS multiple compared to the market

a. Trading at about 1.75x PS ratio[\[11\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn11), argument can be made that Just Eat is somewhat under-priced compared to the SP500 and major indices.[\[12\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn12)

3. Growth will slow down in 2022 and beyond

a. Growth will decrease in the following years, however, they are still expecting to grow in the mid teen digits. 

b. Additionally, it is expected that food delivery is just another pandemic trend that will decrease. The company is still expecting growth in this sector as well as some news sources[\[13\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn13), as habits have formed. Even as people do go back to restaurants and eating out during weekends, with working from home staying, certain habits will remain. The extent of this is still to be seen.

4. Regulation will hurt margins

a. Just Eat will in fact significantly benefit from the recent regulatory changes in Europe. Europe wants to recognise gig workers and riders as workers (so that they get benefits, sick leave, etc.) which would hurt many food delivery business models.[\[14\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn14) However, Just Eat already employs their riders as workers in most European cities and is one step ahead of regulation. This change will in fact benefit them as it could force some competitors out of business as they will not be able to keep operating at such low costs. This is perhaps one of the most significant potential upsides this company has over competitors in Europe. 

5. Highly competitive market

a. A key advantage for Just Eat over Deliveroo, Uber and others is that Just Eat started and continues to operate a marketplace as well to employ riders unlike the competitors. Many restaurants still deliver with their own network of riders rather than paying the fees for hiring the platform, which means that Just Eat can take a cut of the GMV which is at a much higher margin. Therefore, they have a comparative advantage compared to other companies where they can offer logistics solutions that others do not. 

b. That being said, the market is very crowded, and the competition is fierce with many companies investing significant amounts of money to capture market share.

c. This presentation with slightly outdated values intended for Deliveroo inadvertently highlights the cheapness of Just Eat before an increase in GMV and decrease in market cap.[\[15\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn15)  

6. Rising interest rates will hurt growth and their “promised earnings”

a. Rising interest rates will hurt their long-term prospects of the value of their earnings and potential to raise capital. However, an argument can be made that the market has already priced that in, especially after a 60%+ drop and bond yields elevated.

7. Short term – Russian Ukraine conflict

a. This conflict though can be serious, but will unlikely lead to WW3 and all nations joining in. This will be primarily limited to Ukraine/Russia where the target market is minimal/non-existent. Potentially, a recent market overreaction.

EDIT: I got off the phone with Citzens bank. The lady was really nice. The lady from citizens said it was clear fraud. Prior to taking out 20k, there were test runs. They first took out .64 cents, then returned it, then took out the 20k exactly. She put in a claim for me. She said i will most likely receive my money back ""within 10 business days."" I am going to citizens today at 12pm Et to make a new account. My current account is frozen. No money can be taken out of it.

EDIT 2: Went to the bank, made a new account and transferee my remaining money to the new account. My old account is still there. But can only receive deposits and not withdraws. I will receive 20k as provisional. But citizens said that it’ll take 45 days for them to complete the investigation. I’m not sure why it would take that long. I changed my email password, Bank user name and password. I have 2FA on my brokerages. I am looking to see how to add 2FA to my citizens along with alerts.

EDIT 3: Citizens bank said they will refund my money on the 9th of March. Police report filed, will get it tomorrow and send it over to citizens. Someone fraudulently made an account under my name for PENFED. That account has been closed. I put a fraud alert on the 3 major credit bureaus. Changed passwords for bank accounts and username.

personalfinance,Confused about W4 need help to get money now but not get penalties?,"Hello. So here is my situation. Last year I was married filing jointly. Spouse and I both worked at a similar job with similar pay. I don’t think I checked any boxes on our w4. Just left it blank. Made around 70K between the 2 of us. A lot of that was forced overtime. At the end of the year federal we owe about 2500. That’s fine. We had no penalties as far as I know. 

This year is a bit different. Both of us worked the same job similar status up until February. No boxes checked on W4. Just married filing jointly. I just started a new job with similar pay and I Checked no boxes. I just got my first check and it looks like they only taxed 8% of my income. That seems low? Should I do anything or is this probably what happened last year? I don’t care if our situation is the same as last year as I want more money now. I just want to avoid a penalty (not just owing taxes) that is high. I know this year we will definitely make less than 70k because we will both have like no overtime. And my spouse may or may not work in the next few months as they might try to get a different but lower hours and lower paying job. So our income might be more like 50k. 

So is it okay if I leave my current new job W4 at no boxes checked? The only one I checked was married filing jointly. 

Any help would be appreciated and I hope it made sense. If I owe 2500 or less next year that’s fine. I’m just trying to avoid a penalty from being taxed too little.

EDIT 1: A small penalty is fine. I heard something like 12$. If the penalty is like 1000 or more then I would be concerned. Normal owing federal is fine with me

EDIT 2: if it helps I am simply trying to keep it similar to last year. If I would owe 2500 or less on 50K without doing anything to my current W4s then that works. Last year I believe both of us just had a W4 with nothing checked

EDIt 3: Currently I have a 40 hour consistent job with 17.25 an hour. The spouse currently does work 40 hours with 14.50 an hour but may be getting less hours like 30 in a month or 2 and then possibly switching jobs to a 30 hour or less job for maybe 11 to 12 an hour.

EDIT 4: So upon closer inspection it looks like I’m being taxed almost 14% which is less alarming than 8%",finance,1645788887.0

Bitcoin,"German Sparkasse is limiting SEPA instant to 400 EUR for transfers to Coinbase, Bitpanda and Kraken for ""security reasons"".","As the title says, it seems that the Sparkasse is limiting ""SEPA instant"". Every transfer &gt; 400 EUR will only be processed as SEPA which takes about 1-2 business days while SEPA instant will be processed within a few minutes.

They told me that this would be a ""security feature"" since they're facing a lot of fraud and there is no possibility to opt-out of being protected.

So I need a new bank now. Does anyone in Germany have some advice which banks support SEPA instant without ""protection""?

EDIT: I'll try N26 now. Seems to work with Bitpanda but need higher volume trade to confirm (waiting for the next dip...). I also wrote BaFin (German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) to see if this ban/limitation is fine for them too or if this is kind of SEPA discrimination.

vet,Am I Worried for nothing?,"My dog is 2 years old. I got her from Texas in 2020 and had problems with her health from the start, she had mange in Texas, and more problems (the previous owners said she was a puppy of 2 months and we got a dog 6 months old in heat). 
Since she has been with us, she has been to the vet numerous times. I go to the same vet every time, she got spayed there, ect. Now she has really bad allergies. I’m just about fed up. 
They told me that doing allergy testing was a waste of time, and too expensive. I know she has allergies, I just don’t know specifically what they are. 
However, she is on Cytopoint for her allergies, which is supposed to help suppress her itching, feet biting, and other things like the physical discomfort of her allergies. Cytopoint is $125 every 4-8 weeks, and not exactly affordable when you add her “special food” that she doesn’t want to eat but the vet recommended. A vegetarian based pro plan in which the proteins are preprocessed for my dog, and an ear cleaner, and a dog wash (recommended I wash her body TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK).
I love my dog, the money and time and energy is not the problem. The problem is nothing is working. 
Every time we go to the vet, I explain the severity of my dog and her ears. How she is scratching till she bleeds, she cant sleep and shakes her head, she is uncomfortable, often times it is like she is just filled with fluid there. They tell me she is fine. Nothing to worry. Use their ear cleaner. Well, I went through the Ingredients on the ear cleaner, and it’s just a normal ear cleaner for once a month, not for a dog who is having problems. It even says use once every 4 weeks. That is sadly not possible for her needs. 
I stopped using it and am using Chlorhexidine to clean her ears. I have to clean her ears every day to every three days, for her to be able to sleep soundly through the night without waking up and crying in pain. 
I have explained this to the vet, and they do not seem to listen. They tell me it is fine.

Am I overreacting? Should I not worry about this so much? Are there cases in which you have told someone to do the same thing as me and it worked? Is there anything you think I should try? 

I just feel like nothing is working and my dog comes to me and puts her head in my lap when she wants her ears cleaned because she knows it helps. 

(For context: her ears are flappy, and she has thick black and brown wax and looking like pieces of skin and dirt. It’s sometimes crunchy in texture but it can be softer. The vet says she does not have mites and I have two cats she interacts with that have no ear problems.)",cryptocurrency,1645797137.0

Financials: Coinbase reported earnings of $3.32 per share and revenue of $2.5 billion; both were better than expected.

The Good: Trading volume hit over $500 billion and Monthly Transacting Users (MTU) hit over 11 million.

The Bad: The problem with Coinbase was its guidance for the current quarter. The company estimates that its trading volume will drop this quarter due to “global macroeconomic headwinds, rising interest rates, inflation, and more recently, geopolitical instability.”

Stock Price: Shares of Coinbase are down 45% in the past 12 months.

Final Thoughts: Bullish investors are banking that more global crypto adoption will help Coinbase. However, despite more adoption in the past year, the stock hasn’t performed well.

personalfinance,Refinancing home. I think I should? Cash from borrower?,"I'm thinking of refinancing, I dont know much about this area, even much about my own mortgage I feel like. This is our second home, the housing has been booming so much(Austin, TX area) we were able to move locations near the same city while upgrading to a nicer school district, sq ft., and a completely NEW house. Our current home we purchased/financed originally for \`\`\`roughly $273,000 below is what our current lender is offering:

 

Estimated  
Property Value **$527,000**

Estimated Unpaid Principal  
Balance **-** **$220,689**

**Estimated Equity $306,310**

Mortgage Payment: $1,994 / $2,197\* 

Loan Term (Years Remaining): 27+ / 15 

Interest Rate (Fixed): 4.750% / 2.625%\*\* 

APR:  — / 3.400% 

Loan Amounts: $221,224 / $229,500 

Cash from Borrower: $10,322

My main question, what is ""Cash from Borrower""? From looking in these forums I am to beleive this is just what is either owed or given to the borrower to round out a nice re-fi, is this right? Is this what I need up front to do this re-finance? Can this or does this get factored into the coming payments? Can we pay this off in a year of mortgage payments? Or is this all negotiable with the lender?

Second, I assume I should refi seeing how my home went from 273k to 520k in just 4 years and im currently paying 4.75% on a 30 yr. We can afford a little higher per month payment, not to mention in a month ill be making 20% more. 15 year sounds nice compared to 30.

Or would anyone recommend lowering my payment instead, as I would like to payoff some other debt and/or invest.(lowering payment option through their quote tool, kept my intrest rate almost the same, but no cash from borrower hardly to a 1875 a month, and 30 yr)

I have not got any other quotes from any other lenders. Thinking about doing this, however, I've seen some say there is less in fees when using your current lender. 

My lender has also been calling me non stop to refinance, but for some reason I dont feel prepared to talk about it.(luckily I found this online quote thing from them, I hate talking to people because I feel like they are really trying to sell to me and not give me time to think, I also dont feel like I know what im doing).",finance,1645801858.0

Edit: I deleted most of the original text because I was unaware that I must pay estimated taxes quarterly. The rest of my original post is now irrelevant. The correct answer to this situation is this:

Complete IRS Form 1040ES to estimate how much your taxes will be. Divide that number by 12. With each monthly stipend, deposit that amount in a HYSA. Throughout 2022, pay for the months due on each quarterly due date:
  * April 15 for Jan-Mar taxes
  * June 15 for Apr-May taxes
  * September 15 for Jun-Aug taxes
  * January 15 of the following year for Sept-Dec taxes

In 2023, submit your stipend and what you paid as estimated taxes throughout 2022 on your tax return. The amount owed back to you (if you overestimated) or the amount you still owe (if you underestimated) will then be determined.",finance,1645803208.0

personalfinance,What to do with unused cash-out refinance?,"I recently took out a cash-out refinance on a rental property I own with the intent of using the money for a downpayment for a house in a city I was planning to relocate to. The home purchase fell through and I am having second thoughts as to whether or not this relocation is even feasible due to the high cost of living. Assuming I don’t use this money to buy a new primary residence, I’m now sitting on a decent sum that I don’t know how to use. Since I got a slightly higher interest rate through the refinance, I’d rather not just put it back into the investment property as it would end up being a net loss long term. I don’t have any credit card debit, I contribute the max to my 401k, and I have an emergency savings fund already.

The options I have considered are:

1. Use part of it to recast the mortgage for my current primary residence down to the point of having paid off 20 percent of the loan amount. This will reduce my monthly payments and remove the PMI on my house, so I’m not burning money on PMI. I would take the rest (like $20k or so) and put it into stocks or bonds. 

2. Use it for a downpayment on another rental property.

personalfinance,Retirement Savings vs Student Loans,"Hello, I've been mulling over this topic a lot lately and wondering what people's thought are or if there are any factors I'm not considering.

Some basic details about me: Age 29, Outstanding student loans are 24k with 20k at 5% and the rest at 3.5% all federal. Retirement savings are 8 k in 401k and 1.5 k in an IRA and 1K in HSA. Salary 85k.

My story: I entered the workforce 2 years ago after grad school, and travelling a lot through my 20s. Going in, I had 40k in student loans which seemed like such a huge life barrier/burden. I started my first job at 50k and was able to make a lot of progress. In the first year, instead of contributing to retirement at all, I put extra money in a savings account once forbearance started but would periodically make payments towards the balance just for the psychological benefit. After about a year I had knocked the 40k down to 24k. About 4 months ago I started a new job at 85k and while I have been putting about 500 a month since in retirement, I also have about 7k in a savings account (aside from emergency fund) ready to put towards my balance once forbearance ends. 

Up until now, i have had the attitude that it would be so nice to be rid of my loans but I am think that long term this is definitely not the way to go. I've read the stock market's average return long term is 10%. My student loan's interest rates I described above. I also am taking into account forbearance potentially lasting longer and that interest payments are tax deductable- I'll essentially get about 20% of the money I pay towards interest back. I also have a credit score of about 800 and if I wanted to refinance, could probably get a rate at about 3%. So all in all feeling like I need to re-assess my student loan situation as not that bad while with retirement I could use some catching up! Currently I have an extra 7k ready in a savings account for when forbearance ends.

I've already upped my contributions to about $600 a month for my 401k and changed my HSA contributions to max that out. I may have gone way overboard on details here but just wondering how others would approach this!

personalfinance,Tax Question - W2 State Income Tax Confusion with W2,"I'm working through our tax filings (USA), and I'm not sure how to interpret what I see in my fiance's W2

Background:

She works for a company based out of PA. In 2021 we spent roughly 2/3 of the year living in IL (with her working remotely), and then we moved to PA last fall.

For our 2020 returns, she filed PA as a non-resident and IL as a full-year resident, since this was what she was.

On the 2020 W2, PA showed up as the only state that state income taxes had been paid to. I.e. under both the state income tax section of the W2 where it states ""To be filed with employee's Federal Income Tax Return"" and the state income tax section of the W2 where it states ""to be filed with employee's state income tax"" PA shows up in both sections. When we filed, the income tax paid to PA was just credited towards her IL income tax

&amp;#x200B;

This year, though, we need to file as part-time residents for both states (I believe).

On her W2, under the ""file with Federal Tax Return"" section, it lists IL in the section on state income taxes. However, under the ""file with state income tax return"" it lists PA. Both sections, though, show the same numbers. I.e. Boxes 16 and 17 show exactly the same numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm unclear on how to actually put this all in to the tax software I'm using (FreeTaxUSA). Do I put both states under the State and Local Tax Information section or just IL? And then, when I go to fill out the state wage section, it seems like what I need to do is calculate the breakdown between the two states?

This is what I thought I was supposed to do anyway, but I'm ending up with a much larger state income tax bill for PA, since it's indicating $0 tax paid.

But if I put both PA and IL in the W2 form section 1. the software complains since the two states have identical values and 2. I end up with a huge return from PA since it's now counting those state taxes twice it seems?

I went and looked at her actual pay stubs and they all indicate that only PA income tax was paid, so I don't understand why IL is even showing up. I'm a bit lost honestly on what to do with this situation, so any thoughts/input would be appreciated.

Bitcoin,"MUST-READ: ""The Impossible Trinity""","Out of curiosity, how many ""bitcoiners"" actually subscribe to the idea that bitcoin will overtake all world currencies and, specifically, the USD. Economic theory suggests that the ideal currency is characterized by three key attributes: (1) Monetary Independence, (2) Full Financial Integration, and (3) Exchange Rate Stability. In other words, it is impossible that a currency possesses all three attributes. For example, Bitcoin has proven to provide capital mobility (i.e., the free movement of capital) and the ability to potentially express exchange rate stability (not yet proven for obvious reasons). However, in exchange for Full Financial Integration and Exchange Rate Stability, Bitcoin must forfeit the characteristic of Independent Monetary Policy: one of the most favoured attributes by several world economies. In my opinion, I don't see Bitcoin overtaking the USD for that specific reason. In fact, I see Bitcoin and the USD, along with other world currencies, operating in tandem. I believe this view to be quite similar to that of Michael Saylor's, whom you probably already know of by now.

solar,Federal Tax Credit Question,"I’m considering getting solar panels but I want to make sure I understand the federal tax credit correctly. 

According to IRS the Solar Federal Tax Credit is NOT refundable and can only be applied to taxes owed at the end of the year to the Federal Government. 

Therefore, if a homeowner never owes Federal Taxes each year then this credit gives them ZERO benefits. 

My question is, should I adjust the amount of taxes that are being withheld out of my check each week so that I do end up owing the Federal Government 26% of the cost of my solar panels (in this case $12,000) ? That way when I file my taxes, I owe the federal government $12,000, but then I can apply for the Solar Federal Tax Credit? 

This seems like the only way this makes sense.

The only reason to adjust my witholding would be to  withhold less so that I can owe $ and take advantage of the tax credit. 

The benefit being I take home more $ each week.

personalfinance,Capital Gains from Family Investment Reported on 1099-NEC?,"This past year my grandparents gifted myself and siblings $30k each, the maximum tax free amount allowed from the two of them.  This money was loaned to my uncle, who used it on a house flip he was working on and distributed it back to us this year with the proceeds from his work.  This amount totaled \~$61k.  

My understanding was the $30k would always be tax free, and the remaining $31k would be reported as short term cap gains.  Instead, this year I received a 1099-NEC with these earnings on it.  After looking through my taxes this year it seems that the amount I'd owe reporting this as self-employment income vs short term cap gains is fairly close.  For comparison:

**Report as Self Employment Income**: In addition to the other income I've made I'd pay an additional 15.3% to both the fed and CA for the family investment money for a **total of 30.3%.** I don't really have anything I can expense against this.  

**Report as ST Cap Gains:** Both the Fed and CA tax ST cap gains as income. I'm in the 24% federal bracket and the 9.3% in CA where I live (most of my income came as W2 wages and had money withheld already).  I'd technically owe slightly more, a **total of 33.3%.**

I have two major concerns: 1) I'm not sure if the math I'm doing above is correct, I've had an accountant do my taxes most of my life but she retired and I thought I'd try my hand at it this year.  Call it bad timing.  I know there are misc deductions and what-not, but I'm hopeful TurboTax will catch these.  2) Could this cause potential problems since we are essentially mis-reporting the type of income?

Suddenly on 23 Feb 2022, the long position has changed to -5.40% now I paying instead of earning. 

My understanding is they would decrease but gradually but not from 1.40% to -5.40% overnight. that's a 6% decrease in one night. They didn't send emails or make any announcements. 

At this is point it's more gambling than trading since the dealer would change the rules based on their good-willing. 

The Fed hasn't changed its rate yet how did Oanda just decide to change its rate like that ? 

This is like a no-brainer game for the broker to take to the other side of the trade since they change their rate so drastically most traders on their platform will be forced to pay a hefty daily fee or close their positions to avoid daily negative fees market will tank. 

How could the broker decrease a 6% in one night without any announcement? IS this even legal? If they are allowed it means they can manipulate the market at their will. All it takes it's to play with the daily rollover fee over and over. Even a kid would make money if he's the dealer. 

I understand there would be a gradual increase or decrease in rollover fee but I never saw 6% just like that from 1.4% to -5.4% ( long). 

Fed still hasn't changed their rate on US T-Bond what else could affect?

personalfinance,"PNC &amp; BBVA Merger, who else has had a terrible experience?","Work has me pretty mobile all over the planet. I was, and have been abroad since this merger happened. I received a couple of emails about the merger, but nothing too alarming initially.

Thing is, PNC decided to snail mail a notification that all BBVA debit cards would be canceled at the end of January. Since I've been abroad before the merger, I did not get this notice. Why did an email not make more sense?

Anyway, I'm in South America and my card gets canceled. Now my cash flow is gone in a place where cash is king. I call PNC and after a fair amount of yelling and screaming, I am informed that the only way to get a new card is to change my address, wait x amount of days, then express order a card. More yelling and screaming.

Ok, did that. Wait 2 weeks, no card. Call and chat maybe 7 times with no answer or result. Call some more. Eventually, get a person that reactivated my card after being told this is impossible. Great. Where is my new card?

More waiting, new card order. Call 7 or 8 more times having to reexplain the situation. Called back a caseworker and left voicemails 4 times with no response. Then find out the ""new"" card was also snail-mailed after being told it was being FedExed because international bla bla bla.

Nope. So I get it FedExed and was told I would have this card in 3 days max before the tracking number hits their system. This is verbatim. Nope again. After 3 months in the same place in South America I still do not have a card and time is running out.

PNC offers no help. I have been disconnected on multiple times. Promised many things that did not happen. And am just on an island of one.

Fuck PNC and their lies. The last idiot on the phone even tried to sell me a credit card when I still do not have my debit card.

Their defense keeps being, ""but we mailed you a letter saying we will kill your card"". So I should have been held hostage in the USA while their merger got digested. Fuck that.",finance,1645842088.0

CryptoCurrency,Decentralizing a Centralized Microlending,"Anybody who has been keenly following the blockchain trends will know how much it has changed the way the world does business.

 Key industries like finance, the internet, and sports betting have been transformed by the mere adoption of the decentralized system of blockchain. At this point, it is safe to say that the future is indeed DeFi.

The microlending arm of finance has also not been left out of this transformation. Just incase you are unfamiliar with the term, it essentially means access to microloans by small entrepreneurs and SMEs on a blockchain ecosystem.

 In traditional microlending, the workflow is as thus, a microlending website collects funds from investors and funnels them to a borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. Essentially, access to loans is location-sensitive. 

However, with DeFi microlending, borrowers from anywhere can access microlenders from anywhere. Once more, blockchain is highlighted in its transformational glory.

Some reputable platforms offer DeFi microlending services.

I have about $40K in student loan debt still needing to be paid off. I am working towards a masters degree to reboot my shot at a career and get out of stagnation. The masters degree is $10K. On top of that, I'd like to move out when I get a better paying job. So there are some expenses on the horizon.

I have two ideas:

1. Start a Roth IRA, contribute $6K/yr into $VTI (8.67% return since NAV). Safe way to build wealth over time and have money for retirement. Only downside is I'm locking up a lot of my money that I will likely need to pay off student loans, down payment for moving out, etc. I know I'm allowed a one time withdrawal from a Roth of $10K to put towards a down payment but it's not a lot of money.
(With inflation being so high, I'm not as worried about having all this debt, I am also at the lowest interest rates I can get on these student loans.)

2. Keep saving my money, maybe through it into a CD so it is safe from a bear market and not completely becoming worthless from inflation. Use it as a down-payment on a duplex, find someone to rent out the other half to help mitigate mortgage payments.

Or do I just pay off this debt before I even think about investing or buying a duplex?",finance,1645882329.0

# **With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
&gt; Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
&gt; Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”
*****
&gt; # Market reversal
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.
*****
&gt; “Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”
*****
&gt; Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.
*****
&gt; “The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.
*****
&gt; “In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.
*****
&gt; # Fed rate hikes
&gt; Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.
*****
&gt; “We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”
*****
&gt; Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
&gt; A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.
*****
&gt; “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.
*****
&gt; However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
&gt; Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.
*****
&gt; “It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.
*****
&gt; Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.
*****
&gt; He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.
*****
&gt; Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.
*****
&gt; “We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.
*****
&gt; # Boiling oil
&gt; Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.
*****
&gt; “That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.
*****
&gt; # Bullish bet?
&gt; Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.
*****
&gt; But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.
*****
&gt; “We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&amp;P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.
*****
&gt; Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&amp;P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.
*****
&gt; The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.
*****
&gt; The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&amp;P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.
*****
&gt; Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; “It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&amp;P futures.

&gt; # Cold War 2.0 – Midterm Bottom Nears

&gt; In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.

&gt; It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.

&gt; However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.

&gt; Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&amp;P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.

&gt; # Stocks Move Into A Correction

&gt; For the first time since March 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?

&gt; “Let’s remember the S&amp;P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png))**

&gt; What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-2.png))**

&gt; With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&amp;P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.

&gt; As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&amp;P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.

&gt; Normally a solid performing market month, March improves in midterm-election years. In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been up for five of the last six midterm Marchs.

&gt; # 11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine

&gt; Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”

&gt; Here we list 11 things you need to know.
&gt; * While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
&gt; * Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

&gt; * Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.
&gt; * Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; * We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.
&gt; * As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

&gt; * Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.
&gt; * European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.
&gt; * There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.
&gt; * Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**

&gt; * From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.

&gt; This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.

&gt; # What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?

&gt; Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.

&gt; “The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”

&gt; The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&amp;P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.

&gt; Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&amp;P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

&gt; After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.

personalfinance,"I have the opportunity to sell some of my vested shares in a startup through a tender offer, but I have had them for &lt;1 year so taxes will be high","I recently had my one year anniversary at a startup and therefore hit my 1 year vesting cliff, so now I have vested 25% of my shares. The value of the company has increased substantially since I started a year ago. 

I have already purchased these options to insure that I was minimizing my future tax liabilities in case we raise money again at a higher valuation.

We now are being offered the ability to sell 20% of our vested shares (so 5% of my total shares) through a secondary sale. 

I am debating whether I should fully participate which would generate me enough after-tax proceeds to cover the money I already invested and still leave me with 95% of my shares. I.e. the 5% I could sell would net me more after taxes than I invested to exercise the 25% I vested. 

However, given that I have had these shares for &lt;1 year the federal and state (CA) tax rate should be substantial and I feel like it could be a bad move to throw away ~40-50% of the proceeds. I could maximize my value by not selling any shares and fully capture any additional increases in value and also wait until they fall within long-term capital gains. 

I am bullish on the company but we do have a significant cash burn and I am more bearish on where I think interest rates, startup valuations, and the ability to raise money are headed. So my lean is to fully participate so I am effectively not risking anything by getting enough proceeds to return everything that I invested. 

On the other hand, I have no major debts and already have an emergency fund so could alternatively not sell anything and maximize my upside / minimize taxes. 

Does anyone have any perspectives on this? Am I crazy to not just get everything I can out of an extremely risky asset (startups)? Or since I am relatively financially safe, I should just maximize upside?",finance,1645898356.0

personalfinance,Cash-Out refinance an auto loan?,"Hello, this is my first post on Reddit!

I've had my car (2018 Camry LE) that I bought for $16500 with a pretty good warranty (we bought the car from a family friend who didn't want any problems and also didn't give me a choice whether or not to get the warranty but that brought the total loan amount to $18500ish). after paying down some credit card debt (all 0% interest thank god lol) my credit score is now at about a 730 and I am looking to refinance my car.

I got pre-qualified by capital one to refinance which would bring my payment down from $326 to $300 a month and will be looking around at some credit unions in my area. However, after looking online for a bit I saw that cash-out refinance is an option on car loans. My mom is in need of a car and does not have the best credit score. I have the only non-work vehicle in the family.

I ran my car information on KBB and according to them the value of my car is between $22800-$24900 depending on the condition of the car which I would classify as very good.

My question is should I get a cash-out refinance and use the extra money to put to a new car and sell my mom my current Camry? Would cash-out refinance raise the amount of my current loan making it harder for my mom to qualify for the loan? Can I do a cash-out refinance and sell the car shortly after? Are there any rules against this?

My mom does have about $4000 - $7000 to use as a down payment. She also doesn't want to just use the $7000 for a car outright which I have suggested.

If I were to get a new car it would be something under $25000 and most likely a Rav-4 as I like Toyotas and the Camry is too low to the ground IMO.

personalfinance,"Low interest car loan and buy I bonds, or pay in cash?","I've put a payment down on a new truck costing 29k, with an original plan of trading my wife's car in for 5k, putting down 10k, and getting a 14k loan to cover the rest. The loan interest rate is supposed to be between 3-3.5% over 60 months.

  


However, on Monday I totalled my own car after a deer ran in front of me (supposed to be my wife's replacement car after trading in her car for the truck), and the insurance company is paying out well above what I paid for it, and pretty much exactly the cost of the new truck.

  


We've decided my wife can drive her car for another few years after some minor maintenance/repairs. If her car was to completely break down we could survive with a single car for a while since I work from home.

  


Now I'm wondering whether to pay for the truck in cash, or take a 10k loan over 60 months at the 3-3.5% interest rate and buy ibonds with the cash. There is no early repayment penalty on the loan, so if the new ibonds rate drops below the rate on the loan I can sell in a year and pay it off (I actually have 10k in ibonds maturing in November so would likely sell them to pay off the loan if needed). I'd lose interest to the 3 month penalty but still would likely come out even or ahead.

  


What do people think is the best course of action? We have no other debts apart from mortgage. We'd be looking to move into a bigger house in 5 years, right when we could withdraw the bonds with no 3 month penalty, have another 25k saved for a down payment, and have a healthy 20k emergency fund (my wife's job is very secure so we don't feel like we need more, and could sell index funds if we had a major emergency), and equity in the house. Through a combination of Roth IRA, HSA, and 403b I save 25k a year for retirement, and my wife has a pension. No kids yet.

  


It seems to me that buying ibonds and getting the loan makes the most sense, but I may be missing something. I'm new to the USA and new to having any other debt apart from a mortgage.

investing,Bonds and Distressed Investing,"Hello all!

I would say I have a very good foundation on equity research particularly based on the basics of reading a financial statement. I have been trying to read as much about the investing side of accounting and business valuation. Besides this I have also been incorporating a value-based approach reading Graham, Buffet, Greenblatt and many other value based investors. 

Reading some of these individuals, I see that I only have a rudimentary knowledge of bond investing. I have read some basic bond books such as ""The Bond Book by Thao."" This book helped me to have a basic knowledge of bonds and the hierarchy of the rating by credit agencies as well as how bonds are affected by interest rates and how they have performed historically, as well as the risks and dangers of different bond types such as government, municipals, and corporate bonds, as well as junk bonds.

However, I want to get into a much deeper understanding of how to invest in bonds. Are there any good bond screeners? I also find it difficult trying to find the CUSIP of specific bonds. I feel that finding ticker symbols has been much easier. Do you guys use any tools that help you find different individual bond CUSIPS? 

I would also like to be able to have a better knowledge of how to value specific bonds such as corporates. I have been reading *Security Analysis,* which covers this to some extent, but I feel that the language is a bit outdated and a lot of times I am finding myself trying to find out the terminology he employs. Are there any good books, videos, or resources on individual bond analysis? 

Lastly, how about distressed investing such as investing in bonds of bankrupt companies? Reading Klarman and Greenblatt's chapters on investing in bankruptcy and fallen angels and so, I also want to get familiarized with this field. Yes, I know the dangers of this, but I still at the very least want to know how people analyze investing in distressed companies.

I was a part time student for both Spring 2021 (9 credits) and Fall 2021 (10 credits) and due to covid grants, the aid I received was able to cover my tuition, but barely. For Spring 2021, a portion of my aid was finally pushed out in July, but at that point I had already paid for tuition. Of the $700 in aid I was supposed to get, they only sent me $500 and the remaining part of it was sent so late that it was used to pay for my Fall 2021 tuition. Whatever extra money from my grants I had left over from Fall 2021 because of this mishap was never returned to me. I tried to contact the FinAid office but never received a response.

On top of my tuition, my program required me to buy textbooks and testing services that totaled to $800, which is why I wanted to see if AOTC can cover this. I also did not receive a 1098t from my institution for either semester.

My question at hand is when filing for taxes now, do I consider the covid grants I received as scholarships that I used to pay for my school expenses or is what I paid out of my own pocket?

financialindependence,"[Illinois Only] Save $1,000 per year in taxes by doing Traditional 401k-&gt;Roth conversions instead of contributing to Roth directly","Illinois does not tax retirement income, and the law does not make a distinction between income from roth conversions and income from withdrawals.

What this means is you can save money by doing a Roth 401k conversion instead of contributing to a Roth 401k instead.


An Example:

Scenario 1. Your income is $100k, you put $20k into Roth 401k(after tax). You pay tax on 4.95%, you pay $4,950 in taxes.

Scenario 2. Your income is $100k, but you contribute 20K to traditional 401k, and then rollover that $20k to Roth 401k. Your income is still $100k, but $20k of that is ""retirement income"" and thus untaxable in Illinois. You pay 4.95% of $80k, or $3,960. 

**Things to keep in mind:**

1. This does not save any money on Federal taxes.

2. You will need to increase your federal withholding accordingly to cover the income from the Roth conversion. If you do it right, your paychecks should be the same as when you were contributing to Roth directly before.

3. This will make your taxes slightly more complicated.

4. This will only be useful for Roth IRAs if your income is low enough to have deductible IRA contributions.

5. If you are in a high federal tax bracket and plan to LEANFire, sticking with traditional 401k might be better than utilizing this loophole.


Disclaimer: I am NOT an accountant, please confirm with your accountant first.

retirement,Worth contributing to non-deductible IRA?,"I am hearing two schools of thought on this and was wondering if someone could steer me in the right direction. 

I make too much for a deductible contribution to a traditional IRA, so the past few years have been making them anyway since the tax deferred growth is attractive. I already contribute max to 401K, HSA, and make some taxable brokerage deposits.   


These are the two schools of thought I read:  


**1. Much better to contribute to taxable brokerage accounts instead of a non-deductible IRA**

Consider the scenario where you contributed $5,500 to a non-deductible IRA, invested in a stock fund, and the investment grew over the past 25 years at 8% per year.  You’re now ready to liquidate the IRA – all $37,667.  Because of other income sources and Social Security, you find yourself in the 28% federal tax rate which means paying taxes of $9,007 on the distribution. 

Had you made the same investment in a regular brokerage account, you would be paying long-term capital gain taxes at 15% which translates to $4,825 of taxes – nearly half of what you had to pay with the IRA.

**2. Much better to contribute to a non-deductible IRA than Taxable Brokerage account. example one article cites:** 

Let’s do a quick calculation:

* If you have $10,000 invested in a **taxable** **brokerage account**, invested over 30 years at an average annual after-tax return of 7%, the account will grow to a value of **$76,125;**
* If you have the same $10,000 invested in a **traditional, tax-deferred IRA account**, invested over 30 years at an annual return of 10%, the account will grow to a value of **$174,491**
* Also **Roth Ladder Conversions** cited as another reason to contribute to Trad IRA.  

Any experience or thoughts on the above? I have $7K to contribute for this year, (over 50) but would just place into my taxable if this makes more sense.

CryptoCurrency,Brief intro to investing in crypto,"I learned about finance and investing through this sub a few years ago so I thought I’d pay it forward. I recommended this sub to all my friends who were interested in crypto but most of them still requested more help with the investing aspect so this post should be helpful for new investors. I tried to simplify it as much as I could so anyone could understand it because my friends said a lot of the posts here were complicated and more focused on the technology and not enough on investing. I’m no expert so feel free to provide corrections. I also did a [YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3BLMWDYvFxM&amp;feature=share) video if you don’t feel like reading. Also some people prefer YouTube over Reddit so if we really want adoption, we gotta be willing to meet them halfway.

All of this information is just a brief intro so there’s definitely more to each category but some people need a quick overview before going deep into detail.

Decentralization

You ever heard the saying, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket?” That’s essentially what decentralization means. You’ll often hear of decentralization in the crypto community because the technical structure of crypto is decentralized, similar to the way the internet is decentralized. Like the internet, there is no centralized authority in charge. The issue with having power centralized in one entity is that if that one entity is compromised, then the whole system is compromised. Like the internet, there are many nodes around the world that maintain the blockchain so if one node goes down, then the others pick up the slack. Decentralization is not just a technical term though, it’s also philosophical and ideologicalh. One big concern people are realizing right now is that wealth is slowly becoming more centralized, meaning a small percentage of the population, the 1%, are hoarding a large majority of wealth around the world while the majority of the population only holds a small fraction of the wealth. Because crypto is still relatively new, the wealth distribution in the market is far more decentralized compared to the other asset classes. America got rid of the gold standard years ago but the bitcoin standard could be a great way to reset the current distribution of wealth. But if it’s only a small number of the population buying Bitcoin, then in the future those investors could be the new 1%. If more people buy Bitcoin, then the wealth could be more evenly distributed so it’s really up to you to decide whether wealth will be redistributed more evenly among the population. 

Blockchain and distributed ledgers

Most of the money in the world is just digital information of who owns a certain amount of a currency saved on private ledgers held by banks. A ledger is like a book or collection of accounts in which transactions are recorded. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger that is public and and all the bitcoin transactions are saved on the bitcoin blockchain. Think of a physical journal in which every bitcoin transaction is written down in the journal but there is an unlimited amount of pages and everyone has access to viewing the journal. Think of a block as a page, and every time a page is full, then some bitcoin miners receive a monetary incentive called a bitcoin reward and a new page, or block of transactions is created. The fact that it’s public means, that no one bad actor can compromise the blockchain because other miners will correct the the error since it’s decentralized. Banks and other centralized institutions can easily cook the books since their ledgers are private.

Crypto is fractal

A lot of new investors say they can’t afford a whole Bitcoin and it’s expensive but they don’t realize that it’s fractal, meaning you don’t need to buy a whole Bitcoin. Most investors can’t afford to buy a whole Bitcoin, so buying a fraction is more realistic. Lets say you invest $400 and receive .01 bitcoin when bitcoin’s price is $40k. If bitcoin’s price goes up to $80k, you still only have .01 bitcoin but now your investment is worth $800. You still double your money even though you only have a small fraction of Bitcoin. It’s doesn’t matter if you can only buy .01 bitcoin or .1 bitcoin, doubling your investment is doubling your investment despite how small the number looks. 

Market cycles

The crypto market is cyclical like the stock market, meaning there is a cycle of generally high prices, called bull markets, and low prices, bear markets. Bull markets involve the mark up phase where prices start going up and the distribution phase where investors start selling. When selling pressure overpowers buying pressure, it leads to bear markets. Bear markets involve the downtrend phase where prices start going down and also the accumulation phase in which the market has hit its bottom and investors start buying again. When buying pressure overpowers selling pressure, it leads to bull markets. The most successful investors know this and trade the market cycles. Market cycles vary depending on the asset class, for example the stock market cycle is about 7 years while the cryptocurrency market cycle is about 4 years. With the crypto market cycle, bear markets last about 3 years while bull markets only last about 1 year.

Market cap

Market cap or market capitalization is essentially the cumulative value of all the units of an asset or an asset class. Bitcoin has a market cap and the whole crypto market has its own market cap the way Tesla has its own market cap and the stock market has its own market cap. The market cap for assets, such as bitcoin or Tesla stock, can be calculated as the total supply multiplied by the current price. The market cap for asset classes is the total of all the market caps in that specific asset class. Contrary to what some investors think, market cap isn’t the amount of money invested in the asset but more of a reflection of what the market believes the current price is for a specific asset multiplied by the supply. Market caps are important metrics to consider for investors because it’s a more accurate reflection of value and risk. Generally speaking, lower market caps are riskier and more volatile while higher market caps are less risky and less volatile. 

Risk and volatility

Risk is an abstract concept that can be applied to all asset classes as well as real life situations but for investing, risk is perceived as the possibility of loss. So when an investor says a certain investment is risky, it means that there’s a relatively high chance for losses. Therefore, an altcoin with a small market cap is riskier or has a higher chance of loss than bitcoin since bitcoin has the largest market cap in the market. Volatility refers to the unpredictable standard deviation or fluctuation of an asset’s price. More volatility means more variability and less stability in price. The crypto market is more volatile than the stock market so it’s normal to see 20% losses in the short term with crypto while stock traders freak out when they see 5% losses with stocks.  The cool thing is, volatility goes both ways so crypto investors can expect to see 10x returns in the short term while stocks generally provide more modest returns and you’d be considered lucky to double your money with stocks in the short term.  As a rule of thumb, high risk, high returns. Low risk, low returns.

Investors vs traders

It’s important to distinguish between investors and traders because they usually have different strategies, mentalities, time frames, and goals. Investors are more focused on the long term while traders are more focused on the short term. Traders usually focus on capital gains and investors focus on capital gains too but will more likely utilize passive income opportunities since the interest rates in crypto are pretty high. Traders usually have more of a get rich quick mentality while investors understand that building wealth steadily is more sustainable and compounding interest makes a big difference. So if you are going to be networking with others in the space, remember to try to differentiate the traders from the investors because taking advice from a trader when you’re more of an investor might not fit with your goals and vice versa. I don’t like to think of investors and traders as two separate categories but more like two opposing sides on a spectrum. You can be more of an investor and hold 90% of your portfolio for the long term and trade 10% of your portfolio in the short term.

Investing strategy

A lot of new investors think they should invest a large lump sum at once but since crypto is so volatile, it’s really not recommended. For example, let’s say you invest $10k into bitcoin when bitcoin is $40k but the next week bitcoin drops to $30k. That’s a 25% loss of about $2.5k in a short amount of time. It’s very discouraging to see a $10k investment turn into $7.5k. So the best investing strategy is to dollar cost average. Dollar cost averaging pretty much means investing a smaller fixed amount at different time intervals. So instead of investing $10k at once, you could invest $1000 a month for 10 months. The downside is that you mitigate your chances of the highest returns but the upside is that you mitigate the risk of potential losses. Also it’s easier mentally to see $1000 investment turn into $750 than to see $10k turn into $7.5k. Dollar cost averaging also gives you a chance to lower your average buy in price. Nobody can time the market so dollar cost averaging is the safest strategy. 

Capital gains and passive income

The cryptocurrency asset class is still in its infancy so capital gains in crypto are significantly larger than other asset classes. Like I said before, you would be very lucky to double your investment with stocks but with crypto, doubling your money is child’s play. With crypto, you can aim for 10x returns but don’t be surprised if you get 20x, 50x, or even a 100x within a market cycle. Passive income opportunities through staking or just keeping crypto on some exchanges are also more lucrative compared to other asset classes and easy to set up too. You can earn 4%-6% interest on bitcoin on some exchanges but I have variable interest rates on other positions that fluctuate between 12%-40%. If you play your cards right, you can live off the interest if you build up enough capital. You can’t do that with the .01% interest that most banks offer. There are other ways of earning interest with crypto such as yield farming and providing liquidity through decentralized finance protocols but it’s a bit complicated for new investors.

Portfolio allocation

For new crypto investors, it’s always smarter to allocate a larger percentage of your crypto portfolio into the safer investments with higher market caps. Starting with 100% bitcoin for a crypto portfolio is a safe bet but going 50% bitcoin and 50% ether is also relatively safe since ethereum has the second largest market cap in the market. For those who want to mitigate volatility, allocating a percentage of a portfolio in stable coins could help with that. Stable-coins like the US dollar coin are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the US dollar so they are always worth one dollar. Let’s say your portfolio is 50% bitcoin and 50% usdc, if bitcoin goes down 20% then your portfolio only goes down 10%. But that also means if bitcoin goes up 20%, then your portfolio only goes up 10%. Your portfolio allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and if you’re just starting, it’s smarter to play it safe since crypto is already a risky asset class. You can always diversify later on when you scale up your knowledge and understanding of crypto.

Exchanges

There’s two types of exchanges to buy crypto, centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Centralized exchanges are operated by companies which act as the intermediaries for transactions. Decentralized exchanges utilize smart contacts instead of intermediaries to execute transactions that are direct and peer to peer. Think of centralized exchanges as banks, every time you make a transaction with your credit card, the banks process the transactions for you. While decentralized exchanges are like making transactions directly with another person and without a third party. Centralized exchanges are much easier to use so I’d recommend starting with centralized exchanges for new investors. There’s plenty of centralized exchanges out there but some are only available in certain countries. The exchanges I use and recommend for beginners is voyager, crypto.com and Coinbase.

Security

Because of the decentralized nature of crypto, the responsibility of security falls on the investor. There are scams and hacks that happen in crypto just like any other asset class so it’s important to scale your security with the growth of your portfolio. First things first, make sure you have strong passwords and write them down on paper, never save passwords or sensitive data on a device that has access to the internet. Keep your investments on different exchanges and wallets because if one goes down, then at least you got the others. This coincides with the idea of decentralization. Set up google 2 factor authentication instead of text or email authentication for each exchange and wallet and write down the 2fa QR codes for each exchange and wallet as well as the keys for each wallet. Invest in a virtual private network like express vpn to increase privacy. Buy a hardware wallet like the ledger nano for your long term investments while still keeping other investments on other wallets and exchanges. You should write down your hardware wallet’s keys or seed phrases on paper  in case you lose your hardware wallet. Also never disclose how much your positions or portfolio is worth, the more you have the bigger the target you are for scammers and hackers. Don’t click on sketchy links sent to you. If someone tells you they can double your money if you send them some crypto, it’s a scam. It’s advised that you shouldn’t keep that much on exchanges though because years ago the Mt Gox exchange was hacked and everybody who left their crypto on there lost it but it seems like the reputable centralized exchanges are willing to reimburse funds for their users so I don’t mind keeping a certain amount on reputable exchanges but just be aware that it’s in their custody. 

Doing your own research

There are plenty of resources out there to learn about crypto investing and I definitely recommend checking them out. It’s important to cross reference information and never rely too much on one source for information because of biases and conflicts of interest. This also falls in line with the idea of decentralization. I always recommend the cryptocurrency subreddit because of the comprehensive information from there. It can be somewhat of an echo chamber at times and I try not to pick investments based on what’s popular in that sub but they post a lot of news articles, strategies, discussions, and personal experiences that you can learn from. Despite how many foolish crypto youtubers out there who make the stupidest facial expressions, there’s a few that I’ve learned from and recommend such as coin bureau, Benjamin cowen, jrny crypto, and modern investor. I’m also noticing a rise in general finance YouTubers from traditional markets who are getting into crypto which is pretty cool too. MIT did a course on crypto and blockchain and it’s free to watch on YouTube so that’s also a good resource to start with. A lot of crypto investors are on Twitter but I’m not too active on there. There’s also telegram groups and Facebook groups but I’ve never used them because it’s a good way for scammers and hackers to vet out potential victims and they can also be echo chambers. Be weary of crypto influencers because some of them are paid to promote pump and dump scams. Even though banks have been against crypto for years, a lot of them have warmed up to crypto and now they release their crypto research reports to the public which are surprisingly objective and unbiased so I’d recommend checking those out. Many exchanges do newsletters too but obviously they’re a bit biased but I still read them. The most important thing is for you to do your own research. Don’t just try to find the next big thing with 100x gains because you’ll get burned and end up losing money.

I was able to pay off 7k today, paying off my 2 lower balances, and am left with a 18k balance on a single credit card paying 20% interest. Now I’m in an interesting position. I could 

1. Get a debt consolidation loan and pay off the credit card, then just pay back the loan at a much lower interest rate 
2. Take a couple of the 0% balance transfer offers I’ve received on my existing cards to split the balance into 3 6000 dollar balances, 2 of which costing 0% interest for enough time that itll be able to pay off the higher interest one then work these 2 down much easier. My problem with this approach is that requires 3 monthly payments, however the savings on interest could make that very worth it.

CryptoCurrency,"Tip: Don't value your altcoins against USD, value them against BTC","Hey guys, I know that there are a lot of new players here who are excited about the volatility and at the possibility of making huge returns, however, a basic mistake such investors make is valuing their portfolio against the USD and not against BTC or ETH. This is just a tip, **NOT** Financial Advice.

**In a Bull Market - Everything outperforms USD$:**

\- **LOW-Interest** Rates

\- **INCREASING** Money Supply

\- More lucrative to finance and **INVEST**\-

**INFLATION** eats at the value of USD therefore with time it is expected for **EVERYTHING** to **OUTPERFORM** the US dollar. This includes S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, Bitcoin, Gold and etc...

&amp;#x200B;

**Not all Altcoins are created Equally:**

\-Altcoins are a risky business-They are more volatile than Bitcoin and ETH two of the most volatile assets

\-If we are investing in a more risky asset, we should always ask ourselves, is our **RISK ADJUSTED RETURN** enough? How much **RISK PREMIUM** is expected over the market such as Bitcoin and ETH?

\-If there is a higher risk, and we are not outperforming at least Bitcoin, what is the point? The money is better off and safer invested into Bitcoin.

\- If you are feeling cocky though you can compare to ETH, however **MOST** altcoins will **BLEED** against their ETH value with time.

\- When selling, taking profits into **BTC** or **ETH** will likely help you maintain these gains instead of stablecoins or reinvestment into a different altcoin. (This does **NOT** means no stables, just means profit-wise)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to compare:**

\-Bitcoin and ETH are the two largest and strongest crypto assets in the industry. They are expected to survive and thrive and as a result, **WILL** trend up against the US dollar with time.-Most **EXCHANGES (Eg. Binance)** and **CHARTING PLATFORMS** have this functionality.-Look for changing trends (Such as from downtrend to uptrend with higher lows), look for the long-term chart (Is it going up or down against BTC on the Weekly?)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an Example for LUNA:

**FIGURE 1: LUNA/USDT - STRONG UPTREND, Approaching ATH (Outperforming USD)**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h7h4lfejgek81.png?width=1481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b6e54c659e1df1439d029844c4faeb73fa2faf

**FIGURE 2: LUNA/BTC - STRONG UPTREND, NEW ATH SET (Outperforming BTC)**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wn9zs8tigek81.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9cc712dcff721b11d0bd383b4f11478a5e97e1d

**FIGURE 3: LUNA/ETH - STRONG UPTREND, APPROACHING ATH (Outperforming ETH)**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/279hka4igek81.png?width=1499&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b9a581484aeccf4d138e4fb3f60c8bc3fd2635a

&amp;#x200B;

From this Example:

Fig1 - Luna is **completely** outperforming **USD**

Fig2 - Luna is **completely** outperforming **BTC** and has set a **new all-time high**

Fig3 - Luna is still **outperforming** ETH but ETH has **outperformed** BTC so LUNA/ETH is **not at** an **all-time high yet.**

The charts may look similar, but you can definitely spot differences, and these are the identifiers to use and examine the difference between LUNA/USDT, LUNA/BTC, LUNA/ETH. Another thing I wish to state is that you don't need to actually do the calculations in math for the BTC Charts. All you need to do is see the price action and understand its general direction. From this, you can see if your coin is outperforming the market thereby making it a lucrative investment, or is it a risk-on asset with no extra benefits than BTC's price? Since I started implementing this I often found my portfolio beating BTCs annual performance by a higher degree and chance.

I hope this information is helpful for the newbies, I have bolded the important things to focus on, please inform me If I have missed anything. Thanks.

Bitcoin,CDBC is NOT BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻,"Hi there, I put this on a youtube video after learning a lot from you guys. I can see that this is trying to cause FUD about Bitcoin so needed to say something. Hope I did you proud! 😊 

///

**The video said:** “CBDC is for retail and central bank digital banking - a bit like a digital bank note. Universal Credit (digital money) can be programmed by the gov or employers to ensure that it can only be spent on essential goods”

**My response was:** CDBC is the banksters way of trying to create something else, because they are locked out of this crypto system ... Bitcoin is decentralised meaning 100,000’s of computers all over the world acting like a grid, all of them having a ""public ledger"". 

CDBC on the other hand is the new credit score system that they’ve implemented in China. CDBC this is its spending component of this new control system and it will come inn the form of Universal Credit. “Klauss Swabb – WHO – Global Reset – Build back shitter” and what many world leaders subscribe to.

BITCOIN cannot be PROGRAMMED. It is a decentralised network, unhackable, resistant to attacks, outside of government control and permissionless spending and lending p2p. Exchanges can be hacked (but thats the reason to own your private keys) and you can be scammed of course. But Bitcoin itself cannot be hacked.

Fiat money is already digital because  the Banks have transferred their accounting over to computers. So Fiat money is “just an SQL digital database maintained by the FED and our UK Treasury”

Old money used to represent gold or coins, and was a promissory note from the bank

Fiat money is based on nothing, so more can be printed of it when needed, causing inflation and the devalue of everyone’s money over time. 

However Bitcoin will only ever have 21 million coins in circulation in which to discover and purchase. So as inflation goes up due to over printing money and fiat money becomes worthless. Bitcoin value on the other hand can only ever go up over time, due to its scarcity. “Theres 56 millionaires in the world, if each of them decided they wanted 1 bitcoin (from a pool of 21 million) then you can see they will become more valuable”. 

Yes volatility, but this is about an investment over time and about endurance. 2 years ago it was 7k now it flutters around 40k, with more adoption and countries making it legal tender ... The total market cap of cryptocurrency reached $3 trillion in 2021... Bitcoin is not going anywhere!

personalfinance,Check last years state AGI adjustment line if you reported unemployment on your 2020 tax return,"I submitted our 2021 tax return yesterday for federal and state (Illinois) and received confirmation almost immediately that our federal return was accepted. This morning I received an email that our state return has not been accepted because the AGI I reported using last years state initial tax return was incorrect. 

This was because I submitted our 2020 tax return three days before a law was enacted in 2021 that changed how unemployment benefits were taxed in 2020. Illinois automatically updated our IL 1040 form, and we got a decent refund for what we had initially paid taxes on a few weeks after that. Fast forward to this weekend and not even thinking about it, I used the AGI I had from last years original form. It was an easy fix after I pulled out the corrected IL 1040 form I was sent after the late change, but something others can easily avoid if they found themselves in a similar situation.

personalfinance,"Bought my first car yesterday, used my spouse’s income as household income","So, yesterday I bought my first car with my partner. I have worked hard to pay off debt and my credit score is 763. I am a stay at home Mom/college student/apartment manager. The auto salesman asked about my income and I explained that I’m an apartment manager for my complex for 12+ years and the job covers our rent and that’s it. My partner asked about using his income as household income and the auto salesman said it was fine. My partner has poor credit, so he was not put on the loan application at all. We were approved with no issues. My partner is self-employed and brings in roughly $8000/month. I was approved, paperwork signed, $3000 down, and drove off in my new “used” Volkswagen. 

Today, I got a call from the finance manager at Volkswagen asking for the number of my employer to verify income and I was like what? I gave him my partners number, naturally since that is the income we put on the application. My partner got a call shortly after and now they are saying there is an issue with how we applied for the loan using my credit with his income as our joint household income. He brought in $43k last month alone, his biggest contract deal to date. Now I’m worried that if we have to go back in and try to apply for a joint loan, we will get completely screwed on the interest rate(the finance manager mentioned 11% to my partner on the phone today). With my credit, we were able to negotiate the price down on the car as well as the apr at 3.9% over 5 years. This was very much do-able for us based on household income. But I’m worried that we will have to either be stuck paying a ridiculous amount per month if we have to apply for a joint loan and get screwed on the apr or we’ll have to return the car.

My questions is, isn’t this technically the dealership’s fault? We were straight up about everything with our salesperson and there were no issue until today. I need a car, but I have no tangible income because my job technically only covers our rent. My partner is working on repairing his credit, but he makes more than enough to cover the agreed upon payment plan. What can we do to keep our car, apr, and payment plan in tact?

personalfinance,The goal posts just keep moving faster than ever and it feels like it is never going to stop. So frustrated and angry.,"When I graduated college in NJ with a CS degree I did what most people thought was smart; I stayed home and saved as much money as I could. My girlfriend (a speech pathologist) did the same.

At that time a house that would fit the image of our “dream home” was $400k. We live in a mid-high COL area for NJ. Her parents thought we would have to buy something cheaper and fix it up to make it that way. I kept working harder and harder and learned everything I could to get promotions and eventually switched jobs. That dream home would easily be a reality now. 

We make about $180k ($110k &amp; $70k) combined now. That $400k house should be a walk in the park. But it’s not. It’s $650k. The houses here just keep rising and rising. When the pandemic started and no one knew what was going to happen we stayed and kept stockpiling cash. Yet to our dismay the housing market boomed and basically everything we saved was cancelled out. 

Her brother bought a house for $280k with $5k down and we helped him fix it up. They put about $120k into it. It’s now worth like $600k or more. A house in the exact same run down state just sold for $480k down the block. I don’t know how to reconcile with that. Taxes are $14k. 

With just starting a new job I didn’t feel comfortable buying an over half a million dollar house so we found a decent place to rent where we could keep saving. I’ve heard horror stories of people getting let go soon after starting. Two of the people who interviewed me were gone within a month of starting but luckily things have been good and I think I’ll be here for a while. 

Now I’m terrified of what the prices are going to be in a year or two when we move from here. Or what if they keep going up and now interest rates are also going up. Which causes me so much anxiety whenever I consider anything else like buying a car or going on a simple vacation. I’m even more terrified of buying a house for so much more than it was worth and giving up so much money for the rest of my life for other things just for the prices to plummet and be in the red forever. 

I’m even more angry than I am worried. I feel like I did everything right yet because I graduated when I did and the stupid pandemic caused a housing boom I have to just bite my tongue and be happy that everyone’s houses are so go damn expensive now. I know there are people with so much less than me. I was poor my entire life and I wanted to turn things around and be better but now I feel like a fool.

Looking at houses nearby that sold for X in 2020 just to be resold again this year for $150k more with nothing done to them sends me into a spiral of anger and depression. I’m sure other people feel the same and I don’t expect anyone to feel bad for me but I’m so frustrated. 

Never in a million years would I have expected to progress so far and have it feel like so little. If I had bitten off more than I could chew and plunged myself into debt I’d be better off for it right now somehow. Ass backwards.",finance,1646000402.0

stocks,Dow futures fall more than 500 points as traders assess ripple effects of Russia sanctions….what we scooping up tomorrow for the cheap?,"U.S. stock futures moved lower in overnight trading on Sunday as investors grew concerned about the economic ramifications of the fighting between Russia and Ukraine.

Dow futures dropped more than 500 points. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 2.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 3.2%.

U.S. and global equities experienced volatile trading last week as geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated. Early Thursday morning local time, Moscow launched military action in Ukraine.

Throughout the weekend, the Russian advance into Ukraine continued. Russian military vehicles entered Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv with reports of fighting taking place and residents being warned to stay in shelters.

Russian President Vladimir Putin put his country’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert Sunday amid a growing global backlash against the invasion. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said representatives for Ukraine and Russia have agreed to meet on the Ukraine-Belarus border “with no preconditions.”

Last week, President Joe Biden reacted to the attack by announcing several rounds of sanctions on Russian banks, on the country’s sovereign debt and Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 

The U.S., European allies and Canada agreed Saturday to remove key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system, SWIFT.

The Russian ruble was set to tumble at least 19% with banks offering it at about 100 rubles per dollar, according to Reuters. It closed Friday at 84 rubles per dollar.

“Some Russian banks being removed from SWIFT (energy transactions exempt) and the freezing of the Russian central bank’s access to its foreign currency reserves held in the West clearly increases economic tail risk,” said Dennis DeBusschere of 22V Research.

However, he believes Russia can still sell oil and there could be “loop holes” in Russia’s frozen assets, which “might limit the disaster in markets for a few days.”

“Traders will be watching for any signs of resolution on the Russian crisis (negotiated peace or a signs of a near-term victory for either side) or for signs tensions could be worsening raising the chance of a world war involving NATO members,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group. “As news trickles out supporting either thesis, expect daily stock market action to remain volatile.”

Despite the market volatility, the Dow experienced its best day since November 2020 on Friday.

Last week, the Dow notched its third week of losses. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq ended the week in green, rising 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively.

The Nasdaq Composite is still in correction, about 15% from its record close. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are just outside of correction territory.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before Congress twice in the coming week, and he will be followed closely for any signal on whether geopolitical events are likely to impact Fed rate hikes.

Investors will also get a update on the labor department later in the week as the February jobs report is expected Friday. In January, 467,000 payrolls were added.",finance,1646004094.0

personalfinance,Filling out a loan modification form to lower my student loan payments. 2 questions,"So I pay over 850 dollars a month on student loans. Just my private student loans. And I don't have a fancy masters degree or anything. And I make probably half of what I should be making in my field. So 850 bucks a month in a high cost of living city is quite the undertaking. 

I'm filling out a pnc loan modification form and its having me do a breakdown of all my expenses and my income. I know this isn't a tax document, and there's little oversight as to whether or not pnc choses to approve or deny me, but I still don't want to ""lie"" on anything. 

However, about a month ago, I was approved for overtime at work. I've been doing about 10 hours a week of over time. My father says I shouldn't have to include that when it asks me how much I make a month. I should give them what my standard pay is. Because any additional income i make, I'm sacrificing my own personal time for. But I don't know if that's appropriate. 

Second question, generally speaking, what is a good reason to put on forms such as this? ""I can't live my desired quality of life with how much I'm paying"" seems wrong. Should I make my financial condition sound temporary? What should go there under the reason i'm requesting this. 

And bonus question, is there any other ways I can usually lower my student loan payments? I have thought about having someone buy my loans, but there's still a big question mark on what my loans are going to be like once federal loans resume at the end of april. I sent an inquiry asking what my payments will be, but they haven't gotten back to me because my loan servicer is changing between now and then.",finance,1646008642.0
CryptoCurrency,"US Fed, rising interest rates, and Russia/Ukraine","A month ago there was a lot of talk about the US Fed increasing interest rates in March.

All of this was prior to Russia/Ukraine. The global dialogue is the imminent increase in goods across many sectors with energy prices jumping the highest (oil).

Additionally, in the last two weeks there was talk about the Biden administration releasing a crypto executive order on cryptocurrencies.

It’s all but assured that oil prices will jump as conflict continues in Eastern Europe and sanctions settle as Russia is excluded from more of world commerce.

Do you think the US Fed will continue with their plan to increase rates? If they do increase rates, conflict continues, oil/energy prices climb, what do you see happening in the crypto space?

CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA+ Experiment - Week 19 Update,"Well, here we are again for another update and once again, it’s generally worse off than last week. I typically comment on my portfolio and what’s been going on in the world of crypto. Obviously world events have an impact as well, so before I get into anything else, I want to make a couple of emphatic points before getting into the portfolio itself.

1.	Fuck Putin
2.	Slava Ukraini

As a world we are watching what’s going on intently and my heart goes out to the innocent civilians in Ukraine and the terror they’re going through right now. I am blown away by the strength of the Ukrainian people and their balls of steel leader Zalenskyy. We are the same age and I look up to who he is and what he is doing for his country and his family and hope that I would have the strength to do the same if I ever needed to. It’s also times like this that I am thankful for the privilege of being born into a country where, despite any issues I might have with the government, politicians and political parties, I generally don’t have to worry about things like what’s going on Ukraine.

Okay, that’s all I have to say on that topic for now, but I couldn’t make a post this week without addressing my thoughts on the number 1 issue in the world right now.

For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi) as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the community to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my own research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some DD. I have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous posts and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be chosen by the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end of the experiment. For the starting point you can look here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3 and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sxxn4s/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_18_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

As for my crypto portfolio. It’s been an odd week once again. Somehow we had a resurgence right after the invasion, but since we’ve been tailing back down a bit. At the time of my update last week I was down about 25%, despite an amazing run for LUNA this past week, I’m still down about 26% now, so slightly worse than last week. Obviously with the week LUNA had, there’s a new number one again too, in fact other than the interest I’ve gained on BUSD, LUNA is currently my only project that is in positive territory.

As I mentioned above, LUNA had an absolutely amazing week. Up 48% in the last 7 days. It didn’t hurt that the timing of my DCA this past week into LUNA came just before the run started. I bought my DCA when the LUNA price was sitting at $54.12 on Thursday morning and since then it has surged. At the time I am putting together this post it’s sitting at $72.52.

Unsurprisingly, the worst performer is once again TRAC. The only thing it has going for it is the fact that the next two weeks are for group D purchases. Given how far it has fallen over the course of this project, if it has even a moderate recovery after my next couple of purchases it could be sitting pretty good. Do I think that will happen? No, I feel like this is the one project in the experiment that really looks like it was a bad pick (the rest are all performing at least somewhat close to the overall crypto market). We’ll see though, I committed to 52 weeks of this and I liked the project when I picked the 16, so I’m not going to stop now.

For those who have been following a while you’ll also know that I also had a planned “dip purchase” at right around BTC = $35k. We did briefly touch this number towards the end of the week but I had some real life complications that kept me from doing anything at that time and by the time I could have made the purchase the price had recovered so I missed out. I’m still poised for any movement down to this level of BTC = $35k and I will enact a purchase of everything in the experiment should we get there again, provided I don’t have similar issues.

Looking forward, who knows what to expect. I think the number one issue facing the world is the situation in Ukraine and depending on which way it goes I think it could be either very good or very bad for the world economy. I think the upcoming week is a complete crapshoot. This is exactly what DCA was made for. Good or bad, I’ll be putting my money in.

One last comment before I sign off for this week. Next week is one of the updates where all projects will have the same money invested. Those are always my favorites as all of the coins are on equal footing, so be sure to tune in next week to see where we stand.

Oh, one really last point this time, since BlockFi no longer allows me to add coins to my interest account I'll be making the control purchases on Celsius going forward. I'm still holding what I've already bought on BlockFi as they're paying interest on it still, but the future purchases will be through Celsius and therefore may have slightly different interest rates. Also, I'll likely switch to UST which is available on Celsius but wasn't on BlockFi because I like the LUNA ecosystem. This will not affect the experiment any since they are both stablecoins pegged to the USD, so I'll just be tracking the total quantity between the two with the accrued interest.

As always, if you want to see where the portfolio stands at any time you can always check it on CoinGecko here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolios/public/pokoire-1-year-dca-experiment.",cryptocurrency,1646017737.0

   So I’m a fairly irresponsible male in his early 30s and so I have a bit of debt across a few cards. I make about $90,000 Gross and my monthly income varies depending on overtime etc. My current situation has me working out of town for 3 years, I’m ~14 months into that work assignment. So for the nexts 22 months or so I have no mortgage/rent payment. My monthly expenses can vary but let’s say they average $1,250 for simplicity. That’s my credit debt, my car payment, my insurance on two my car and my truck, my storage unit, streaming services and digital subscriptions, etc. 

My Highest interest card has about $3,000 on it at like 27%
My Car has about $4,500 on it and accrues ~$11 in interest a month. I believe 2.9% 
I have some some other cards with debt everything is higher interest rate than the car.

I’m familiar with both the snowball method and the avalanche methods and their pros and cons. Basically what I’m asking is since the car minimum payment is so high at about $360 would it make make more sense to just pay the car off in a month or two rather than throwing that money towards the higher interest. It’s not really a snowball as it’s far from my lowest dollar amounts but it seems like $360 a month of increased income might be enough reason to veer off the avalanche path for a short time. I’m going to have a $2,500 cash “windfall” on top of my ~$2,500 paycheck on Friday. If it were your debt what would be the most attractive option for you?

He quoted. These big politicians, from whichever country they are, are used to centralisation and doing whatever the fuck they want w anyone’s money. 

A random NFT project decided to freeze Russian addresses. Idk if it’s decentralised or not and if it just froze the exchange marketplace 

And the chief said these funds can be donated to war effort. This makes 0 sense. Someone’s gotta tell him **“not your keys, not your crypto.”** He thinks the frozen funds can be just taken off. Makes me wonder how he thought it was so easy 

Can our fiat funds be just frozen and taken off from us too whenever they wish? 

And also Ukraine is putting a lot of focus on crypto, as they asked all major exchanges to freeze Russian addresses. Which is “stealing from normal people” who may not be supporting Putin and war.

“The Russian central bank (CBR) hikes the benchmark interest rate to 20%, in an unexpected move on Monday, as the rouble crashes to all-time-lows.

Bank of Russia said that “the rate hike is designed to offset increased risks of rouble depreciation and inflation.”

The central bank added that it is “ready for further action.”

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the Russian Finance Minister will decide whether to order exporters to sell forex revenues on market.

The Russian rouble has crashed over 40% so far this Monday, in the face of unprecedented Western sanctions against the country’s financial system over President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

CryptoCurrency,"A Digital Token, Backed by Physical Gold - My Due Diligence on Digital Gold","**TL;DR PAXG is basically digital gold**

So with the recent price surge in gold, I can't help but feel that gold has been the ultimate store of value since the price hasn't moved much in the past 10 years *~~^(not including the drop in 2011)~~*, but with recent macroeconomic problems, people have been moving their capital into safe-haven assets like gold due to the fear of inflation

&amp;#x200B;

# What is Pax Gold(PAXG)?

Paxos Gold is an ERC-20 token created on the Ethereum blockchain, with which Paxos aims to solve important physical gold challenges and markets. In other words, the traditional market lacks a high-quality, easy-to-purchase, transport, store, and trade gold product. 

PAX Gold (PAXG) is an asset-backed token where one token represents one fine troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar, stored in professional vault facilities. Anyone who owns PAXG has ownership rights to that gold under the custody of Paxos Trust Company. Since PAXG represents physical gold, its value is tied directly to the real-time market value of that physical gold.

&amp;#x200B;

# What it's trying to achieve?

PAXG gives users the benefits of actual physical ownership of specific gold bars with the speed and mobility of a digital asset. Customers are able to have fractional ownership of physical bars. On the Paxos platform, customers can convert their tokens to allocated gold, unallocated gold, or fiat currency (and vice versa) quickly and efficiently, reducing their exposure to settlement risk. 

At any time, PAXG holders can lookup the serial number, value and physical characteristics of their vaulted gold just by entering their Ethereum wallet address on the PAXG lookup tool on [Paxos.com/paxgold](https://paxos.com/paxgold).

&amp;#x200B;

# Pros

*  As the only global currency that **has stood the test of time**, *gold* has outlasted every government and paper form of money—making it essentially **default proof**. As a long-held **form of wealth preservation**, protect what you've earned and saved throughout the years with physical gold.
* Gold has often been considered a **hedge against inflation**. In fact, many people have looked to gold as an ""alternative currency,"" particularly in countries where the native currency is losing value. These countries tend to utilize gold or other strong currencies when their own currency has failed.
* Gold is a real, physical asset, and tends to hold its value for the most part. 
* Probably, the biggest benefit of investing in gold is **Portfolio Diversification**.  As we have mentioned, the price of gold performs very well in times of uncertainty.  Therefore, a splendid way to balance the volatility and returns within your investment portfolio is to include gold in your line up.

&amp;#x200B;

# Cons

* However, gold is not a true perfect hedge against inflation. When inflation rises, central banks tend to increase interest rates as part of monetary policy. Holding onto an asset like gold that **pays no** **yields** is not as valuable as holding onto an asset that does.
* **Gold Has A Terrible Historical Return**, especially when comparing to the S&amp;P500
* You may have to wait **years** for gold to go up in value

personalfinance,Check my math/thinking on solar panels?,"I signed up for solar panel financing/installation last week, and while I think I did the diligence, I'd love to make sure I'm not off-base.

Basic facts about my current situation:

&amp;#x200B;

* Approx. $83k income, take-home after taxes and deductions is about $4,500/month.
* Currently no debt besides mortgage ($1,600 including taxes/insurance) and about $1,500 worth of expenses (a credit card that'll be paid off in the next month and a financed cell phone).
* About 3 months of e-fund savings easily accessible.
* House is currently worth probably about $375k, owe $270k.
* My house is about 40 years old and entirely electric (HVAC, stove, water heater, etc.). My total usage over 12 months is about 11,000 kWh and my utility bill averages out to about $130/month.
* Roof on my house is brand new, which is what got me looking at this in the first place. Windows are newer, I don't think there's any obvious energy drain I'm aware of where I could optimize my utility usage more than I already do.
* Currently no plans to leave my house, but can't say with certainty that I'll be here in 10+ years either.

&amp;#x200B;

The details for the system I'm currently contracted for:

&amp;#x200B;

* $38k total for installation - financing the entire amount at a .99% rate over 25 years.
* Eligible for a 26% federal credit on the cost ($9,880) and a $1k grant from my state. So the real cost of the system is more like $27k.
* System is expected to generate 100% of my current usage (11,000 kWh) in year one, with a .25% degradation rate meaning that it should still be generating about 95% in year 20.
* I'd be changed to a net-metering system which sends energy back to my utility provider when I generate more than I need. In the winter in theory this should give me a credit I can pull against when I'm using more electricity than I generate, and if we have a very mild year could ultimately end with me getting a small rebate back from the utility provider if I use less than I generate over 12 months.
* Payment for the first 15 months is approximately $106. The lender structures the loan assuming that you'll ultimately give them the entire Federal credit you receive. So the first 15 months of payments are based on financing $28k, not $38k. If I give them the money, the loan payment stays at $106. If I don't give them that money (or just give them part), then after 15 months the payment re-amoritizes to reflect what I still owe - on the outer end that would increase the payment to about $145 I believe (sorry, doing it from memory so I don't have the numbers right in front of me).
* My state also utilizes SRECs, which I can sell back to the energy company - basically for every 1,000 kWh the system generates, I can sell one credit to the utility company which they can use to certify with the state that they're meeting renewable energy targets. The credits have been worth about $80 each the last couple years here, but have gone up in the $150 range and down in the $6 range prior to that. They're basically commodities which work under supply/demand logic. 
* If I was to sell the house down the line, I can either try to increase the sales price enough to cover whatever extra I still owe on the system and use proceeds to pay it off, or if they can get approved for it I can transfer the remainder of the loan under the same terms to the new owners.

&amp;#x200B;

So my thinking has been that the panels low-end fixed payment is already less than I give the utility company for the same amount of anticipated production. If the SRECs continue to have current value, I'd be netting out to paying roughly 25% of my current utility bill. But even if the SREC went to having absolutely no value, getting from $130/month to $106 is still 80%, and the spread will grow as utility rates continue to increase.

I do know there are some financing charges loaded in as a result of getting the .99% rate, but truthfully I quoted a few companies and this proposal is within a couple thousand dollars of other companies that would have had me going to get my own financing (so presumably weren't loading their quotes) which featured significantly higher rates and shorter terms. My thinking is that with this I could pay extra if I wanted and amoritize again later down the line if I really wanted, but for this rate it hardly seems worth it. 

The biggest downside to me seems like it's going to be whether these provide enough value to to the house if I do sell sooner than anticipated, or whether I can make the convincing pitch on someone else to assume the loan/whether they can get approved for it. But the longer I stay in the house the more I'm the one realizing the benefits, and within 5 - 10 years I'd probably not really be able to parse out exactly how much of my home's value is the panels vs. any other enhancements I made if I went to sell anyways.

personalfinance,Car and house timing,"For the past month or so my girlfriend and I have been house hunting and are hoping to find something soon. Unfortunately I'm at the point where my car is getting way up there in miles, and I had been planning on this or next year being the year to purchase one (before the pandemic hit). I just put a deposit down on a car that was supposed to take 2-3 months to arrive, giving us plenty of time theoretically to buy a house and not have to worry about it. 

In what would otherwise be a welcome surprise, it turns out the car will likely arrive in the next 3-4 weeks instead of 2-3 months. This puts me in the awkward situation where I would be purchasing the car during the closing process theoretically (housing market sucks so who knows). I have talked to our lender about buying a car and she said it was ok as long as the loan was less than $10,000, which it would be. However the original plan was to get the car purchase handled either before or after the house not during closing. 

Does it make a difference if the purchase of the car is made ***during*** the closing of the house? Is that going to delay closing, or mess with our interest rate?

personalfinance,My father died in late December 2020. His last quarterly commission was paid in Jan 21 and we have a 21 w-2 with his name and ss#. What is the correct way to file their taxes?,"My father passed away on December 27, 2020, he was a sales manager and part of his compensation was a quarterly commissions payment. His employer knew he passed on the 27th. His final payment was direct deposited to the joint account he and my mom shared in January 2021. We filed their 2020 taxes last year as married filing jointly (as we should have) and indicated that my father was deceased. I’m working on my mom’s taxes this year, she is retired and only had social security income, but she also has a w-2 for the bonus payment that my dad received. How do we go about filing this? As I understand it, she can’t file as “married filing jointly” this year since my father was deceased, but she can’t claim his income on her return since it has my dads name and social security number on it.   
  
His employer withheld federal and state taxes on his last check along with ss tax etc. it’s a small 5 figure check and with my mom only having ss income their taxes are very low, so I just want to make sure I file it all correctly for her to avoid any issues with the irs. 

Per the irs website it looks like the employer should have 1099 misc since the pay was made in the tax year after he died. 

&gt; Wages. The entire amount of wages or other employee compensation earned by the decedent but unpaid at the time of death is income in respect of a decedent. The income isn't reduced by any amounts withheld by the employer. If the income is $600 or more, the employer should report it in box 3 of Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, and give the recipient a copy of the form or a similar statement.
Wages paid as income in respect of a decedent aren't subject to federal income tax withholding. However, if paid during the calendar year of death, they are subject to withholding for social security and Medicare taxes. These taxes should be included on the decedent's Form W-2 along with the taxes withheld before death. These wages aren't included in box 1 of Form W-2.

&gt;Wages paid as income in respect of a decedent after the year of death generally aren't subject to withholding for any federal taxes.",finance,1646073029.0

personalfinance,Should I expect my tax person (CPA) to be able to explain why I owe federal taxes this year for the first time in my life?,"We've been using the same tax person for about 15 years. She's a friend of the family and has for the most part done a decent job. Our taxes aren't overly complicated (mortgage, kids, RSU sales) but we've stuck with her mostly because it's one less thing to worry about and the family connection.

She just informed us that we owe $10k+ to federal and will be receiving $5k back from state (CA). This is the first time I have ever owed taxes at filing. I'm pretty conservative with my W-4 exemptions and have not changed them since our last kid was born 8 years ago. I did make about 20% more last year due to RSU appreciation but I sold them at vest time so the cost basis differential was minimal (a couple hundred dollars at most). And shares were sold at vest time (about 32%) to cover taxes.

When I asked her why I owed and why the discrepancy between Federal and State, she just said ""I have no idea why they are different other than the huge tax consequence from selling the RSU’s, including a very significant increase in overall taxable income.""

Is it unreasonable to expect the person I'm paying to do my taxes to be able to explain exactly why I owe what I owe? I'm sure I can dig in and figure out for myself but that's honestly what I thought I was paying her to do.",finance,1646086027.0
personalfinance,30 Year Fixed Mortgage vs 10 Year Balloon Mortgage and Refinance?,"In our case, we would be paying 20% down for an initial loan balance of $250,000.

The 30 year fixed rate is 4%, and the 10 year balloon is 2.875%. Neither have prepay penalties.

If we go with the balloon, we could pay as if we were paying the 30 year fixed and end up with a much lower principal when the balloon is up. While we are planning on staying in this house for more than 10 year, we are planning on finishing the basement which would mean refinancing within 10 years is likely.

The house is also a new build, and between that and the 20% down I don't expect we would end up underwater when the balloon is owed.

However, recent Fed messaging has me wondering if 4% is still low in the long run. If that's the case, the 30 year fixed rate might save me money over the course of the loan.

The 30 year fixed is also stable, and I would always have the option to refinance if the rates ever went lower.

Obviously nobody can predict the future, but I'm curious to hear what opinions people may have.",finance,1646086216.0

My spouse and I plan to refi at the end of this year since we are in the process of adding another bedroom and a half bath (current house is 2 bed 2 bath) and to knock off the PMI. My question is it even worth it to refi? Between the closing costs and having to pay more monthly should we just put our extra mortgage payments in index funds, let it sit for 15 years so it can grow, and pay our house off at the 15 year mark? Also, would the interest amounts be the same if I refied to a 15 year vs. if we pay off our 30 year mortgage in 15 years? Thanks in advance!",finance,1646088577.0

CryptoCurrency,BSV Vs Vitalik Buterin,"(re-posting as original was removed)**tldr; Ethereum is a fraud, along with all other ICO's. The original bitcoin wins against ethereum every way imaginable.**

#Bitcoin Vs. Vitalik Buterin

The first lie is that ethereum, and many other cryptocurrency projects claim to be “decentralized”. If you asked 100 people in the ethereum camp what “decentralized” means, they’ll generally respond with a vague answer that, in essence, says either no one controls the project, or, everyone has a say in the project. 


Let's examine the belief of ‘no one controls the project’. Let's examine if this statement is true or not. If no one controls the project, that means no one can make the rules. If no one controls the project, it means that miners can create extra coins out of thin air because ‘no one controls the project’. Users would be able to create coins out of thin air as well because ‘no one controls the project’. Being that users and miners of ethereum can not create new coins out of thin air means ‘no one controls the project’ is misinformation. 

#On
 the opposite end of the spectrum, we can take a look at the statement of  ‘everyone has a say’ in the project, and see if this statement regarding “decentralization” is true or not. This statement is designed to make people feel like they have some sort of power. If this were the case, then a miner would say that he should be granted more coins because he pays more for his electricity than other miners. And, since ‘everyone has a say’ in the project, he would be given extra coins. Obviously, this is not the case either. 


We have addressed both statements in their contexts, and concluded that, in the context of “decentralized”, the two statements are false. We can now start to explain how bitcoin really works. But, before we do that, I want to explore a little deeper on why the two statements of “decentralized” seem to resonate with the majority of the crypto space.

#Claiming 

that ‘no one controls it’ or ‘everyone controls it’ sounds somewhat poetic. It sounds like a flower in the wild that can grow on it’s own, yet can be watered and enjoyed by everyone. This is why the statement and sentiment is so popular in this space. Yet, if you try to apply either of the statements to the real world, they don't hold water. If a miner believes that no one can control the project, and issues himself an extra 5000 ethereum coins, it wouldn’t work. To the same extent, if a miner believed ‘everyone controlled the project’ and tried to reward himself 5000 ethereum coins, that, too, wouldn’t work. 


The issuer of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, wants people to believe that he isn’t in control of Ethereum. He wants to distance himself as much as he can from his own project. This is because of the fraud  committed during the ICO days of Ethereum. And the shenanigans continue to this day. The truth is that Vitalik is the issuer of Ethereum. 


An ICO is nothing new, despite what the millennials are made to believe. An initial coin offering is regulated by the SEC. The practice of creating and issuing tokens to be traded for profit has been going on before the 1960’s. Just because the tokens are digital, doesn’t make a difference to the SEC. A claim for scalping (fraud) is generally one involving promoters of securities. Here is an SEC case that may seem familiar:

#“In

 a related scheme, the Commission charges that Czuczko touted shares of his own company, Epic Media, Inc. Epic Media, based in Los Angeles, is a development stage company with plans to publish “lifestyle magazines” for men and women. Czuczko is Epic Media’s CEO and CFO, and chairman of the company’s board of directors, as well as its majority shareholder. The Commission alleges that in early December 2005 Czuczko recommended the purchase of Epic Media stock on a website that was the predecessor to the Stockster site. After the price of Epic Media stock spiked, Czuczko sold his shares for a small profit. Czuczko did not publicly disclose those trades, among others, in stock ownership forms required to be filed with the Commission under federal securities laws.” 


Most individuals purchased Ethereum ICO, not as a utility, but as a security. They purchased it to make money from the rising price and to trade it. This practice is regulated by the SEC. Vitalik did not register with the SEC prior to his Ethereum ICO in 2014. 

#Furthermore,

 when a developer, or issuer changes the protocol of a blockchain project, they are in fact, issuing new tokens. That means, whenever there is a fork of any kind, the issuer(s) are issuing new tokens, different from the previous token. To put this concept into perspective, we can take the analogy of a car, which has well understood protocols. If you purchased a car, and two years after you purchased it, the manufacturer removes the engine, doors, and seats to your car you purchased, and gives it back to you; you no longer have a car. The manufacturer has issued you something other than your original purchase, that really can’t be referred to as a car.  We’ll discuss this in more detail later. 


For now, realize that Ethereum has several red flags, including fraud-like behavior. Also, Ethereum’s issuer is actively trying to distance himself from the project to avoid accountability. And most of the Ethereum  believers are under the spell that ethereum is decentralized with no one being held accountable for new tokens set to be issued in the coming fork; which has been proven to be false. With these red flags alone,  bitcoin KO’s Ethereum in every aspect imaginable.",cryptocurrency,1646092521.0
