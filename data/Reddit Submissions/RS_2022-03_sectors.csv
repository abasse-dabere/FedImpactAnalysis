personalfinance,"Possibly refinancing an auto loan, want to make sure I’m doing the smartest thing","My current loan is through PNC. My amount financed was $10,881.36 with a 6.29% APR for 72 months. Grand total of loan: $13,126.32 with a monthly payment of $182.31. I have been making payments since September 2020 and have $8,392.07 left of the principal balance ($8,417.72 balance total).

I cannot refinance through PNC because I live in Tennessee, so I reached out and have been talking with Fleet Financial/iLending Direct. They’re offering me a fixed loan of $9,692 with a 5.5% interest rate for 72 months. Grand total of loan: $11,400.97 with a monthly payment of $158.35. If I deny optional gap coverage, my monthly payment would be $146.35.

It all looks good on paper - lower APR, lower monthly payment, lower total cost of the loan - but like I said, I want to make sure I’m doing the smartest thing here. This is the first car I’ve ever made payments on, so it’s the first time I’m dealing with loans and refinancing and all of that. Is there anything here I’m not seeing or not considering?

We knew this wasn't our last home to buy but with the addition of 2 children and 1 pandemic market we are questioning if selling now before rate increases arrive is a sound strategy. 
My biggest concern has always been that we would have to purchase a house in the same market we sell so all of the joy and profit from selling would likely be consumed in our next house purchase. With the Fed saying rate hikes are coming soon, does that make selling sooner rather than later a sound strategy? Are we risking housing prices dropping with rate hikes?

Forex,Is USD/CAD ready to finally breakout this week?,"USD/CAD spent all of February locked in a horizontal channel, but this week could be the key in helping the Canadian Dollar rally against the greenback.

The BOC is expected to hike rates on Wednesday following guidance of a more aggressive tightening cycle during their last meeting, and inflation continuing to soar. Rising oil prices are also supporting the loonie as Putin retaliates against the West, fuelling speculation that the next steps are likely to result in the disruption of oil supply. USD/CAD could now be poised for a deeper pullback having closed below its 50-day line for the first time since January.

However, Fed Chairman Powell’s testimonial to Congress is also scheduled for Wednesday. The invasion of Ukraine has caused a repricing for a less aggressive start to the tightening cycle from the Fed in March, but with high inflation persisting, Powell could surprise the market and maintain his hawkish tone. Further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict would also likely see risk-adverse flows return to support the USD. This could help USD/CAD quickly reclaim its 50-day EMA, and even allow it to target a breakout above last week’s high. 

All trading carries risk, but USD/CAD should be worth adding to the watchlist. It will be interesting to see whether any of these developments prove to finally be the catalyst for the pair to break this range.",finance,1646097168.0
personalfinance,Buying a house - downpayment help,"I just landed a new job, which pays more than twice what I am making. Once it starts, I'll be making $130,000/yr, or about $7500/month after taxes. 

I have been trying to save for retirement; I honestly never expected to be able to afford a mortgage. I have no debt, a $20,000 emergency fund and $125,000 in investments. Investments are split into \~$70,000 in retirement accounts (Roth, 457b), and $55,000 in non-retirement investment accounts. I have no idea what my credit score is; I don't have a credit card, and lucked into a car from a family member. 

With interest going up, I'm interested in buying a modest house. I'll be working from home, and my current place is broken and mold-infested. I'd like to buy a place where the mortgage payment would be reasonable even if I were to start earning a lot less - I'm looking at houses around $190,000-$250,000, or maybe slightly more for something that is extra perfect.

My question is about downpayments. The money I have saved was always intended for retiring, and it makes me feel a little sick to imagine spending it on a downpayment. At the same time, I'm a little worried about waiting too long to purchase - with interest rates going up, waiting until I saved the downpayment/closing cost might affect my price. Also, real estate prices continue to rise. (Also, did I mention my current place is a hellhole?)

Should I save the money from my current job and leave my investment be? Remove the money that isn't in retirement accounts? Take out all the money from retirement accounts for as big a downpayment as possible and then replenish from new earnings? Buy with a less than 20% downpayment? Try to borrow money from a parent and then repay as soon as possible? Take a little extra out of my emergency savings fund, with the plan of replenishing?",finance,1646098342.0

personalfinance,Looking for a bit of advice on how to proceed with a Santander auto loan,"I changed jobs and relocated across the country approximately 7 years ago. As a result, I didn’t do a wonderful job managing my credit and ended up with a poor credit score. 


I needed a car and was obviously unable to secure any type of credit for a lease nor did I have enough cash on hand to buy used. My solution was to buy a car at Carmax and accept a horrible sub prime loan through Santander. 

I figured it would get me the car I needed and even though I would end up paying almost in interest what I was for the car, decided that’s what I should do.

Fast forward to now and I have virtually no debt and very near perfect credit. My thought was to try and refinance my auto loan and pay a lower interest rate to a different company. Then I became familiar with amortizing loans. 

I currently find myself in year 4/6 of a 25k loan in which I still owe 10k after paying $600/month for 4 years due to paying primarily interest with how front loaded the lease was. 

My question is, what option would be best for me at this point? I can continue to pay Santander for the next 20 months since now I’m at the part of the loan that is principal heavy. I can refinance, which seems like it’ll cost me money regardless of how low my interest rate is. Or I can sell my car, which would pay off the remainder of the loan and leave me with a few thousand to use as a down payment on a new car.

personalfinance,Buying a house - Should I buy the house in low tax high price state or high tax low price state ?,"I live in Massachusetts. And planning on buying a house. I know it is not the best time to buy a house with the crazy market but i have to buy it now. House prices in MA are very high, the type of house we are looking is around 650K-700K and the property tax are 1.2% range.

My other option is to buy a house in Connecticut, it is our neighboring state. We found good school districts in CT they are better than the schools in MA (MA has better school districts but the houses in those areas are going over 750K)

The problem with CT is they have higher property taxes. Almost double comparing to MA property taxes. (I think overall CT taxes are higher, not only property taxes)

I did some math to compare the mortgage payment in both the sates and below are some numbers (Very high level)

MA - 700K house - Monthly Mortgage payment is roughly $3800 (Including principle, taxes insurance)

CT - 500K house - Monthly Mortgage payment is roughly $3124 (Including principle, taxes insurance)

NOTE - The type of house that we are looking for will cost around 700K in MA but in CT, it will be around 500K

By looking at the mortgage payment, you can see that I can save close to $700 in monthly mortgage payment in CT. (Even though the taxes are higher) But I dont know I'm missing something. When I look at the State taxes, there is no much difference between MA and CT. even Sales tax are not bigger difference. I dont want to buy a house in CT and later find out there are more taxes or fee's in CT that will eat up that $700.

I'm currently living in MA but saving around $700 every month in mortgage is really make a big difference and I have no problem moving to CT. But if I buy a house in CT and the saving is $200-$300 per month, then I can stay in MA without moving to CT.

Can someone give me insight about disadvantage of moving to higher tax state like CT even though I can save money in mortgage payment?

I have some money down for a new build home, and it should be scheduled to close June 1, pending supplies. I have a pre approved mortgage but need to get the eye locked in. A couple of questions:

1) because I had to put earnest money down, instead of paying down some debt, I sunk the money into the earnest money at first. Now I can pay down the debt and finish my 5% down payment (I’d have a significantly higher down payment but money is tied up elsewhere… but I could possibly get 20%).

Will lowering my DTI be better for my interest rate?

2) should I try and lock it in now, versus in the next three months? 

3) what, if anything, will the Ukraine situation affect rates in the US?

CryptoCurrency,The creative director of the gaming studio supported the Russians and was fired,"The RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN conflict is also beginning to affect the politics of gaming studios around the world. After the renowned Belarusian studio Wargaming, which is behind a hit like World of Tanks, stopped the promotion for the Ukrainian market and changed the presentation and way of advertising its game by removing shots of tanks in a rush from promotional videos, the dismissals began.

The target was Sergei Burkatovski, the creative editor of the franchise, who posted support for Russian military operations on his Facebook profile. In the post that has now been deleted, he expressed support for ""the armies of the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of Donetsk and the People's Republic of Luhansk.""

personalfinance,HELOC vs. HELoan - Looking for some advice/clarification,"I understand the differences in both but wanted to make sure the options that were offered to me by a local credit union sound fair/common practice as this will be my first time taking on something like this. 

Are HELOC's (line of credits) usually variable APR? 

Option 1 (that I'll likely be going with) HELOC

Using the line of credit allows us to only pull what we need to complete the projects at hand but will allow for a good size of ""spare"" funds in-case we do need them. Its my understanding that we will only get charged interest on the money that we actually draw from this line of credit. 

This becomes important as we are keeping the home that we are remodeling for a rental (first one) and the HELOC is to complete the last two major projects before we purchase our new home without needing to dip into our down payment. This will also give us an option to easily cover both mortgages for a few months while moving and patiently finding the right tenants. 

HELOC is variable with prime =0% right now is 3.25, 70K line of credit that we will only likely use about 30K of. 10 year open draw and 30 payback with no penalty for early payment (3 year min.)

Option 2 (I do like the fixed interest rates but I don't think that justifies the other negatives) 

HELoan would need to be received in full and interest paid on all. Also the HELoan has a higher APR BUT is fixed. This is the difference that entices me...

HELoan has 10, 15, 30 year payback options with 4, 5, 6% interest rates respectively. Also there are closing costs that will be incurred with this type of loan. 

With the current state of affairs I'm assuming that the interest rates will climb and will account for that  in my payment plans, BUT I still feel the variable is worth it. 

I really appreciate any advice. This process of getting a HELOC and a second mortgage is a terrifying process for me but something I have looked forward to for a long time.",finance,1646139036.0
personalfinance,"30-Day Challenge #3: Prepare your tax return accurately and file early (March, 2022)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Prepare your Tax Return Accurately, and File Early**. 

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've filed your US federal income tax return by March 31st.

Recommended Steps:

###Plan
1. **Learn how US income taxes work:**
* Watch [Basics of US income tax rate schedule](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/basics-of-us-income-tax-rate-schedule)
* Watch [Tax deductions introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/tax-deductions-introduction)
* Read /r/personalfinances's very own [wiki page on income tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)
* *Understand* what exactly your tax return is: A form you fill out, telling the government how much money you made, calculating how much taxes you owe on that money (your ""tax liability""), and ""squaring-up"" with the government: Figuring out if you already paid more than your actual tax liability throughout the year with paycheck withholdings (in which case you will get a tax *refund*), or if you haven't paid enough throughout the year, and owe a balance to the government.
2. [Determine your filing status](https://www.irs.gov/uac/what-is-my-filing-status) and determine whether you can be claimed as a dependent by anyone (for example, your parents), or can claim any dependents. ([IRS Dependent Tool](https://www.irs.gov/uac/who-can-i-claim-as-a-dependent))
3. **Prepare a ""map"" for what documentation you will need to fill out your tax return**, then go through the list and make sure you have the documentation for each. **Don't worry if you forget something.** The software you use to fill out your tax return (or the tax return form itself) will remind you of things you might have forgotten.
* Jot down every possible way you made money this year (remember, even if you don't get a form, you still need to report it):
    * paycheck from my job (W-2 form)
    * interest on my bank account (personal records like your December account statement, or a 1099 form)
    * dividends from my stock (1099-Div)
    * income from my small business or self employment (personal records, or 1099 form)
* Make a list of all the possible deductions you might think you are eligible for, and make sure you have documentation:
    * mortgage interest you paid (1098)
    * student loan interest you paid (1098-E)
    * education expenses (1098-T)
    * state or local income taxes (W-2)
    * charitable contributions (personal records)

### Prepare and file your Tax Return
**Using one of the following methods**

1. See if you are eligible for [completely free tax return preparation software](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) sponsored by the IRS
2. Use paid (or free) tax return preparation software. Examples: TaxAct, TurboTax, CreditKarma, AARP, FreeTaxUSA, TaxSlayer. [See our megathread for discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%28Tax+Filing+Software+Megathread%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=year#res-hide-options)
3. ""Manually"" fill out the tax return form online using [IRS Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)

By starting early, it allows you more time to deal with unanticipated questions about your tax return. ""Wait, can I claim my girlfriend as a dependent""? ""Do I have to report income from renting out the spare room in my house to a friend?"". When these come up, feel free to create [a new post](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/submit?selftext=true) asking for help with as much details as you can provide.",finance,1646139603.0

personalfinance,Paying off a mortgage in a dead persons name…?,"I’m trying to decide how to best approach the house I currently live in.  The mortgage is in my grandfathers name who passed away in 2003.  My parents didn’t have enough credit to qualify when they bought it and then he passed away and it just never got changed.  I think his sister is the executor of his will now that my grandmother has passed and she has to write the house to my mom? My mom also lives in a house in his name but I think it was specifically written to her in my grandmothers will.  

I have been living in the house since 2016 and making the mortgage, insurance and tax payments.  I only owe around $22k and will have it paid off before 2030. 

I am financially secure and have a huge chunk of cash leftover each month.  I was considering paying my motorcycle off (8k) and maybe seeing about getting a loan for the remaining amount and paying off the mortgage? The interest rate on the mortgage is higher than I’d qualify for with a regular loan through my credit union.  I could easily pay off the $22k loan in less time than I’m doing the mortgage.  Then maybe we just do a “sell” of the house into my name.  Is that a thing that’s possible?  Or am I making some really poor financial decisions by paying a mortgage to a dead borrower?  

The newest mortgage company is horrible and I really just want the house moved into my name and paid off.

We’ve always lived HCOL cities (NYC, Boston, Chicago) but our living expenses have pretty much been the same for the last decade, we’ve just continued to make more and more money, so we’re extremely comfortable.

Now our monthly home payment is going to go from about $2500/mo to about $4300/mo. At the same time, we’re shelling out $2800/mo on childcare which will leave us with about $2,200 a month left over (after utilities, car payment, 10% 401k contribution etc…) which feels grossly irresponsible and out of character for me.

I know this is temporary. We aren’t having any more kids and our childcare costs will drop dramatically when we go from full time nanny to daycare/pre-K next year to public school in 2 years.  I also know we still have income growth ahead of us, given that we’re both in our early/mid-30’s but I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m being fiscally stupid and am going to become “house poor”.

We were able to lock a really great interest rate (3.5% 10Y/ARM) and I don’t see interest rates improving, which is the obv opportunity cost of waiting.

The loan was paid off and no account currently exists under my name.  Which is a bit of a problem when I call because their phone tree wants my account number which no longer exists in the system.

I needed a lien release so I called them and they told me they do not provide lien releases to customers.  They said I have to have my bank contact them for the release.  Which I did.  Except Wells Fargo did not respond.  So I contacted my bank again and they again requested the lien release and again Wells Fargo did not respond.  Here it is almost three months later and Wells Fargo has still not released the lien after multiple attempts.  I called them and they agree the loan is paid in full but they will not provide a copy to me but when my bank contacts them they promise to send the release but never do.  Soon my bank will convert my secured auto loan to a personal loan at a much higher interest rate.  I have a copy of the cancelled check and it clearly states on the check that by accepting the check Wells Fargo agrees to release the lien.

personalfinance,"I'd like to file exempt from withholdings with my employer, but I have some questions.","Hello!

 Just beginning my journey of teaching myself financial literacy. I've been reading &amp; researching a lot but I'm having trouble coming up with some answers about a recent idea I've had.   


My idea is that I'd like to stop having my employer withhold taxes for me, so that I can hold onto it myself. That way I can set aside around 30% of my paycheck (My employers withholdings for the past year have never exceeded 29%) , &amp; combine it with my Emergency Fund &amp; Savings to gain bigger interest in my Money Market Account (it's a high interest savings). Then when it comes tax time, just pay the IRS what I own in full from that account.

I work a considerable amount of overtime, and just want to put my labor &amp; money to work in the smartest way. It's a little aggravating to work 60-80 hours and watch so much be withheld. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd found that I would need to change my W-4, &amp; about having to meet the conditions stated on page 2 of the W-4 form. I'll paste that part just below.

"" You may claim exemption from withholding for 2022 if you meet both of the following conditions: you had no federal income tax liability in 2021 and you expect to have no federal income tax liability in 2022. You had no federal income tax liability in 2021 if (1) your total tax on line 24 on your 2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR is zero (or less than the sum of lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30) ""

&amp;#x200B;

I checked my 2021 tax return, &amp; found that on line 24 of my 1040, it had ""$2,840"", and lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30 were blank. But also on my 1040 it shows that $3,570 was withheld from my W-2 on line 25a. So more than enough was withheld, and I received a refund.  


So I suppose my overall questions are,

1. Was this even a good plan? I figured the MMA would be a good 0 risk, &amp; legal way.
2.  I cannot claim exempt for 2022, because of the ""$2,840"" on line 24 of my 2021 return?
3. If not, how can I get make sure I would meet the conditions for next year?

personalfinance,Small Payments &gt; Lump sum?,"I'm looking for a second (and third and fourth) opinion on some financial advice I got from my parents.

backstory: my parents encouraged me to take out student loans for college, since I was accepted into private University (US)  and we could not afford to cover the cost. I now know this was a bad financial move, but was following their advice.

I graduated in 2020 with $60k in debt (I graduated a year early too, to keep the price tag lower). I worked all through college, and used my Pandemic unemployment money to get ahead on costs. Presently, I'm about $40k in debt ($20k from a private provider, $20k from federal student loans).

My parents said they would match my loan payments for the first 3 years out of school, but reneged on that for personal reasons - no hard feelings, times are tough and it's my debt anyway.

The advice:
I was planning to put down a large lump-sum payment on the $20k from the private lender, about $8,000, with an interest rate of 5.6%. 

My parents said It would be better to increase my monthly contribution than put down a large sum, so I have more in my account for emergencies.

Given the crap advice I got from them before, I'm wondering what someone else would do in my situation?

For clarification, I still have 6 months' worth of living expenses after the lump-sum payment, but with WWIII looming, I don't know what the wise choice is right now.

Any advice welcome!",finance,1646160335.0

personalfinance,Combat Zone Capital Gains,"Hi everyone,

Thanks for taking the time to read the ramblings of a frustrated taxpayer. Just to give everyone some background on my situation, I deployed to Afghanistan in 2019. During that deployment, I had some traumatic experiences and I vented my frustration by gambling in stocks. I accrued over $70,000 in losses in the market, and was advised by my accountant to enjoy the $3,000 losses I could annually claim for the rest of my life, as that was the only thing the government would provide while I injected my money into the market.

I was deployed to Afghanistan for a second time from November 2020 to July 2021, and was on standby in Kuwait from July 2021 – August 2021. During this time, I had an extraordinary performance in the markets and turned $20,000 into $2MM. I recently got my 1099 from my broker and have been working with my accountant whose initial estimates put me at paying around $800,000 in federal taxes, and another $250,000 in state taxes to California.

Call me Ebenezer Scrooge and unpatriotic, but I am trying to find or set a legal precedence to prevent the government from extracting such an exorbitant amount of money from me. To my broad understanding, citizens pay taxes because they enjoy the defense/infrastructure/amenities/etc. provided by the government. I was in the Middle East in an austere environment for 2/3 of 2021 and compromised my mental/moral integrity when I left behind some Afghan interpreters and friends, whom I had previously promised I could help, during the Fall of Kabul. I enjoyed none of the benefits of being an American citizen but must foot the bill like I never left the country. The California state tax is even more infuriating – I have not lived in California in over 9 years but am charged their ridiculous tax rate while having no ties to that state. I suppose I am to blame for that issue – I should have changed my state of residence, but that brings me back to my original point of being absent from the United States. I am not saying that I shouldn’t have to pay taxes – rather, I should pay for the duration of the year I spent within the country. I missed multiple significant personal events and milestones during this deployment, to include the death of my grandfather. That all comes with service, and I am no stranger to personal hardship, but I cannot reconcile half of my fortune being taken away. Between managing over $1.4B of government equipment, liaising with 4 international militaries, and going on combat patrols I had to juggle the stress of actively managing my portfolio while in an inconvenient time zone halfway around the world.

To conclude my rant – if I wanted to go to court to fight the IRS and only pay 1/3 of the tax they say I owe, would any sane lawyer take my case? Is there any possibility of winning? I can’t imagine the tax courts have seen too many cases like mine before. The IRS’ Armed Forces’ Tax Guide [2021 Publication 3 (irs.gov)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3.pdf) does not cover capital gains in depth, so I would really like to set a precedent for extending the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion to cover capital gains as well. (Obviously I have selfish reasons for this, but I truly believe our servicemembers deserve it.)

Once again, I really appreciate any insight and apologize if I come off like an insensitive brat. I know that having to pay over $1MM in taxes is a “good problem” to have, but I’d like to imagine if you were in my shoes, after being through what I was put through overseas, you’d feel entitled to keeping some more of the fortune you made.",finance,1646164078.0
personalfinance,Do I sell or hold my rental property?,"I purchased a rental property a couple years ago for a decent price. It had 3 apartments.

Let's say I can get 700k for the property. After taxes and debt, I would walk away with about \~450k.

1. Pay off my home. I no longer have a mortgage payment. Interest rate is only 3%. All my extra income goes to investing. I have a large amount of equity in my home for whatever I need.

personalfinance,Was there some kind of withholding change that took effect Jan. 1st 2022?,"My work changed payroll systems towards the end of last year. The new system is practically illegible, it's impossible to get simple things out of it like what your actual gross pay was and what you spend on medical deductions anymore. It became so dense I stopped checking it. But I realized my last two paychecks were very noticeably low, about $150~200 down. I spent some time today trying to parse them and realized my checks since the beginning of the year have been very low; I'm seemingly being over-withheld to the tune of about $100 extra federal, $50 extra social security, plus a few extra $ here and there for state (WA) and medicare taxes.

I expected medical to go up a bit with a new calendar year. By comparing paychecks and getting all the other numbers I've figured this amounts to only about $5 of the increase. One other thing that has changed on our pay stubs is ""imputed income"" is now listed in the same way as salary. While I understand taxes are owed on that money, I don't see any reason that would *suddenly* account for an extra $100+ owed each paycheck. My withholding must have been pretty spot-on last year because I did get a small refund. If this had been wrong all along I should have owed nearly $5k.

So the first thing I checked was [what changed for 2022](https://www.the-sun.com/money/4490094/key-tax-changes-for-2022/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20IRS%2C%20the,standard%20deduction%20will%20be%20%2419%2C400.). So standard deduction going up, 10% bracket expanded a bit. If I run the federal income tax numbers on my salary (roughly $82k) I see that I actually pay $200 *less* under the 2022 system, at least in FIT.

My first knee-jerk reaction is that payroll has fucked something up and is double-counting imputed income. If I add all that up it would be like I was earning an ""extra"" $600 which ballpark explains the extra federal taxes at least. But figured I would ask you guys to see if there is something I missed before I go in to talk with payroll/HR guns blazing.",finance,1646165520.0

Somewhat new to this sub but have learned a ton recently from obsessively reading but I need some help with this. I (33F) am a physician in my 2nd year of independent practice, and my current salary is 268k (live in East Coast HCOL city, made 299k last yr with extra shifts etc). I took out federal student loans for med school. I had one year between graduating and starting residency where I was employed by my school in a teaching capacity and I filed my first tax return that year (2016) which I used to set myself up for an IBR plan for my student loan debt. Then I started residency and in my first year I (stupidly) got caught up in internship, and failed to file 2017 taxes (which I've now done), and therefore never re-did my loan payments and sad to say I have not paid on my loans since then.

It's been 5 years and I've only been holding out for this long because of covid forbearance. I've started a serious relationship and am looking to be married, etc, within the next couple of years and I need to get a better hold of my finances. I want to pay off my loan (eventually) and I'm considering taking a second per diem job where all the money would go towards loan payment.

I just have no idea where to start or who to call. I don't know how to explain this and that I was just being stupid which I don't think is a great excuse either. I don't even know exactly how much I owe although I'm sure it's \~500k at this point. I don't think the hospital I work at is eligible for PSLF even if that is an option for me after trying to just run away from this problem until now, when I no longer can.

I no longer have access to my account with my loan provider and have not for a while. I got emails last year from the dept of Education saying my payments were on hold because of covid.

We put a deposit of $40,000 down and have a small bi-weekly payment of $408. We bought the house when we both made a lot less( both ~34,000 in 2017, ~$65,000 2022).

We now have a daughter and our house needs some work. The bathroom requires an upgrade due to some bathtub issues. Back windows were a massive energy user and should be replaced (plus our energy rebate is giving us back $350). Our roof really needs to be replaced, as shingles are pulling up a lot now. We are out of storage, and it's driving us crazy. Plus, our large shed is not in a great shape, so we are adding a garage. New siding for the whole thing. All of it is going to cost $70,000.

Our mortgage is up for renewal, so when's a better time to get a mortgage segment and do a reno? We both have really good credit and have been actively saving since  we were 20 (30 &amp; 33 now), so we have good amounts in both our TFSAs and RRSPs. Plus, we both have great pensions

Our bank can offer us $58k, as that would take us up to 80% of the assessed value. We need another $12k. Our bank has advised that they can add the required amount if we pay a $700 legal fee. I don't understand why, but ok. This would be a line of credit that once the contractor is paid, we move to a mortgage segment. The mortgage segment has an interest rate of 2.54%.

If we were to move and even just get what we already have, in our area, it is easily $350k. For an upgrade, it would be $425k.

My questions are:

1. Is there a better way to pay for this?

2. For the $12k not covered by the line of credit without the $700 legal fees, should we pay the fee and have a larger line of credit? Or should we pay with money from  our TFSAs?

Last Tuesday I had a package shipped international via USPS to Mexico. The item tracking on [usps.com](https://usps.com) shows it stalled in their ""International Distribution Center"" the past couple days, NBD, I expected it to take a while. Yes, I probably should have used DHL or FedEx, but that's neither here nor there. The post office did set the expectation that the package might not be trackable past US Customs so I haven't been too worried about it.

Today I received an SMS to my US number with the following text:

&gt;\[U.S. Postal Service\] - Undeliverable package, please check your address is correct [https://usps-services.us](https://usps-services.us/)

My initial reaction was ""damnit. I know the address is good, I get stuff delivered via AMPM, FedEx, DHL, etc all the time."" First click on the link and the domain resolved but gave a 404. Strange. I'm in Mexico, and sometimes sites are region locked so I flipped on the VPN. Page loads. it's a very very convincing clone of the USPS page. I was a little skeptical since I had checked my legit USPS tracking not long ago and it hadn't changed so I did a little digging before putting any information in. First, a tracking number populated automatically when the page loaded. I took that number and punched it in to the USPS tracking site. Not found. Then I did a Whois on the domain:

Registrant Name: Theresa Chavez Registrant Organization: Registrant Street: 4961 Woodbridge Lane Registrant Street: Registrant Street: Registrant City: Southfield Registrant State/Province: MI Registrant Postal Code: 48235 Registrant Country: US Registrant Phone: +1.3135446952 Registrant Phone Ext: Registrant Fax: Registrant Fax Ext: Registrant Email: [**464312406@qq.com**](mailto:464312406@qq.com)

Pretty sure the USPS isn't registering their domains with [qq.com](https://qq.com) addresses...

I'm going to forward this on to the [United States Postal Inspection Service](https://www.uspis.gov/report). I doubt they take things like this lightly.

personalfinance,Wife is getting several calls / letters a week from her loan servicer even though she’s on an active IDR and there’s supposed to be a freeze on all federal loans until May.,"My wife is currently on an income driven repayment plan for her student loan. It’s in good standing (not defaulted) and she was making all payments on it until a few years ago when she became unable to work due to health issues. She’s now on SSI and since that’s not considered income for loan purposes her IDR dropped her loan payments to 0.

A few weeks ago she started getting several calls and letters from her servicer telling her the account is 30 days past due and she now owes 300 and some change. She called them immediately and was told her IDR had expired and she was 30 days behind. They informed her she would need to resume payments or reapply for another IDR.

According to studentaid.gov her IDR is in effect until 2023. Also isn’t there a federal loan freeze in place until May? She reapplied for the IDR but it takes some time to process. In the meantime she is continuing to be harassed by the loan servicer.

personalfinance,"My mortgage company seems sketchy with a refinance, need advice","We bought a house in 2019, and the mortgage has changed banks twice since then. The current mortgage company called my wife two months ago offering to refinance to a lower interest rate and save us $200 a month by dropping the PMI. They'll even let us skip the first month.  Again, that was two months ago. 

My wife works 2 jobs, but has tried to follow through as the point of contact for this. We have been up front about all things related to our credit history, such as job changes and a chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2014. Because they don't have a local branch (they're in NJ, we're not), they requested information over email, but I had no way to securely send it. I set up an account on their website and attempted to send the information to the agent we were working with. It apparently went nowhere. The agent then advises how to set up an account and drop it in a ftp. Immediately after we send the requested info, the case is handed off to someone else and more info is requested.  We provide new info and advise of info they already received. Then handed off to agent #3, who needs more info and updated pay stubs because it's been a month so far working with this. We send it in and agent #4 is now on the case, requesting information already provided to the first 3. When called out on that, suddenly agent #5 wants all documents related to the bankruptcy including the former house we gave up. We didn't have to provide that when we bought the house, why the hell do they need that to refinance? And they want us to sign a form saying we will provide all requested documents by 3/11 or the deal is off.... 

This delay is holding up other financial decisions we have to make. We can't take out new credit for necessary medical procedures or change jobs.

I suspect they messed up and were not supposed to offer the refinance deal. At this point they're trying to wait us out and delay us by having us jump through hoops to get it. Basically make us say ""forget it"" so they don't have to honor the offer.

But I am certainly no expert. Does a refinance typically involve more documentation than buying a house? Does a refinance typically take this long to process?   
I will be calling them tomorrow, and I won't get off the phone until I understand what more they need, what they will be looking for, and what documents they may need based on what they find. Or if this was a colossal waste of time and energy because they fucked up.",finance,1646190227.0

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell still sees interest rate hikes coming, but noted Wednesday that the Russia-Ukraine war has injected uncertainty into the outlook.

In remarks prepared for dual appearances this week before House and Senate committees in Congress, the central bank chief acknowledged the “tremendous hardship” the Russian invasion of Ukraine is causing.


“The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, and we will be monitoring the situation closely,” Powell said.

“The near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain,” he added. “Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.”

The remarks come amid 40-year highs for inflation in the U.S., complicated by a Ukraine war that has driven oil prices to around their highest levels in a decade. Consumer prices increased 7.5% from a year ago in January, and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showed its strongest 12-month gain since 1983.

Powell and his fellow policymakers have been indicating for weeks that they plan to start raising benchmark interest rates to tackle inflation. He reiterated the stance Wednesday that the process will involve “interest rate increases,” along with indications that the Fed eventually will start reducing its bond holdings.

“We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched while promoting a sustainable expansion and a strong labor market,” he said. “We have phased out our net asset purchases. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month.”

Inflation still expected to fall

The Fed will start cutting the size of its asset holdings after rate hikes have begun, he added.

Since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, the Fed has been buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities at the fastest pace ever, driving the total holdings on the central bank balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion.

Powell said the reduction will be conducted “in a predictable manner,” largely through allowing some proceeds from the bonds to roll off each month rather than reinvesting them.

On the economy, the chairman said he still expects inflation to decelerate through the year as supply chain issues are resolved. He called the labor market “extremely tight” and noted strong wage gains, particularly for lower earners and minorities.

“We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation,” he said. “We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion, and that is only possible in an environment of price stability.”

Markets have fully priced in a rate increase at the March 15-16 meeting but have decreased expectations for the rest of the year since the Ukraine war began, according to CME group data. Traders are now pricing in five quarter-percentage-point increases that would take the benchmark federal funds rate from its current range of 0%-0.25% to 1.25%-1.5%.",finance,1646229605.0

personalfinance,"Going to grad school soon, but struggling to buy a car in this market.","M27, USA.

At the moment, I expect to be quitting my job later this summer to enter a master's program. I'm waiting on a few offers for assistantships as the application period for those starts this week, but based on my years of professional experience and from conversations with faculty, I'm expecting to get a tuition waiver (hell yeah) and a minimum of between $1,300 and $1,600 per month based on various factors.

Last November, my 2014 Ford Focus' transmission computer failed in a store parking lot. At 104,000 miles, it's covered under an extended warranty, but because Ford neglected to build up its warranty reserves for these parts that historically tend to fail, it's been on the lot of the local dealership since and unable to drive. I'm currently projected to have the part fitted in late June or August, when I'll be two states away.

I'm starting to have serious anxiety about the state of the car market because prices are so elevated, and I'm potentially taking a big pay cut to take on the opportunity of a close-to-free degree that I believe will set me up to achieve more in my career down the line.

I currently make a salary of $50,000 per year, but recently got a bonus totalling about $4,500 that I plan to use as a down payment. TrueCar currently estimates my car without the replacement part would go for $2,750 or potentially $5,000 with the part, but I'm not holding my breath for either of those since the Ford dual-clutch automatics are well known as being pretty shit among dealers. I currently have an auto line of credit at my local credit union for $12,500 at 2.89% APR and credit near 900. I have $5,400 in federal student loans from undergrad between 3.4% and 6.8%, and I can put that into forbearance. Barring any major expenses, I should be debt-free on credit cards.

Right now I'm considering three options:

1. Use more of my line of credit to buy a slightly nicer vehicle, namely a hybrid with few reliability problems like a Prius. In my area, I'm looking at spending north of $11,000 for a car with around 100,000 miles. I'm thinking that buying a younger car would reduce the chances of a serious breakdown in the next two years and save me on gas, but I'd risk carrying a car payment that may leave my margins after paying rent, utilities, health/car insurance and food worryingly low. On the flip side, I know how to do plenty of basic maintenance on a car and use it as a transition to something newer once I re-establish a decent wage (and hopefully EV range/EV infrastructure/split hybrids advance to the point where road tripping to national parks and forests won't be a risk.)

2. Buy a car where I can pay off the cost and own it free and clear before the wage reduction. In my market, that mostly means cars that are north of 150,000 miles, have salvage/rebuild titles, or both. I also have to consider the cost of pre-sale inspections.

This option means no fixed payments and I can get rid of the car as soon as I get a wage to support buying a newer, hopefully less inflated car. But at the same time, an aging, high-mileage car is more liable to break down and suffer from gas prices rising.

3. Try and find a used transmission computer part in the country that may or may not flash to my car. I estimate this would cost $750 for a non-OEM remanufactured or salvaged part, $100 or so to tow it from the dealer to a shop and $350 to install it and reflash the computer to work with my transmission. I'd also throw $1,000 minimum for replacing the clutch as it's probably on its last legs, and $150 for a new battery since the car has been dormant outside in the Colorado winter and my current battery had a few years on it.

Yes, that comes out to ~$2,500, but replacing the part with a non-OEM would void my warranty with less-than-quality parts that may not even arrive to me on time since there's tens of thousands of other owners also trying to get the same part. This could quickly become a money pit.

Any advice or words of wisdom would be spectacular, as I don't feel like any of these options are particularly ideal.",finance,1646230539.0
CryptoCurrency,AMA with Nervos Network lead architect Jan Xie. Earlier today we had an AMA with Jan in our telegram group. Here’s what he had to say,"AMA with Jan Xie answers

Let’s start with a question from KnowledgeNervos

Jan, could Nervos act as a Layer 0 to other chains that have not addressed the trilemma, and have made compromises on decentralization/security? Could these chains benefit from running on top of the CKB, and if so, has Nervos approached other chains with this idea?

CKB can definitely be used as a security anchor or ""layer 0"" of other blockchains. You may notice that Godwoken and Axon are both L2 frameworks that can be used to build application specific chains on Nervos. Besides the shared security provided by CKB, building on Godwoken/Axon can also enjoy the benefits of Nervos interoperability 2.0 and access to a larger user base. I think our BD team has approached teams with this idea but I don't know details. BTW. I don't like the term ""layer 0"". There were two definition of layer 0 in crypto: 1. a p2p network/protocol that can be used by many blockchain networks. 2. a shared security layer under all other blockchains. The first definition is a misconception because p2p network is not a layer parallel with layer 1/2; the second definition implies a single ""layer 0"" blockchain worldview which I disagree. There will be multiple layered networks each has its own layer 1 but no one can rule them all.

Next up from 
ckbsamurai

The roadmap uses the term multi-chain. In regards to interoperability, is the future multi-chain, cross-chain, or both?

Both. There will be multiple chains, and there will be bridges between those chains to create cross-chain interoperation.

Now we have a question from
YokaiFamily

public in general don't like complexity.
How would Nervos ensure that people using its ecosystem don't have to go through the complexity of crypto and can use it like ""they are searching something on Google"" or ""sending an email""?

In short: by building a layered network and making layer 1 as flexible as possible.

Security, decentralization and UX are conflicting design goals and the best way to get all of them is divide-and-conquer, or achive them on different layers. With layer 2, middleware and user interface, complicated technical details can be hidden from users. UX can always be optimized or improved at upper layer. You don't know how SMTP works but you can use Gmail. You don't know how TCP handshake is completed but you can watch Netflix. Internet is as complicated but upper layer protocols and applications hide those details.

The difference between Internet and blockchain is we have 1 more goal while we build upper layer applications - preserve the security and decentralization as much as possible. The extra goal requires a flexibile layer 1, otherwise the upper layer applications would have to rely on centralized intermediaries to realise smooth user interface. That's why projects like Unipass, an email based web3 identity system, can only be built on CKB without any centralized intermediary.

For question 4 we hear from 
kevtam515

Jan, now that Nervos is working on sidechains and SMT Dapps, will any of those be optimized towards institutional use, giving the the security of our L1 and being able to scale to their needs on L 1.5, L2?

I like the idea of having solutions optimized for institutional use. Godwoken, Axon and SMT dapp are all general frameworks with very open licenses, any team should feel free to package them into business solutions. The core dev team are focusing on public insfrastructure such as frameworks/protocols not on business optimized solutions, because there're so many scenarios we really don't know which one is the best to optimize for. The core dev team will always be happy to support solution teams who can talk to customers and find the best use of Nervos.

e.g. a latest NFT campaign held by Mibao/NervinaLabs is actually based on a new NFT standard CoTA, based on SMT. Consider it as a out-of-the-box solution for NFT issuers https://twitter.com/yixiu_yx/status/1498626881176109059

Following up with a question from
BTC_0857

How does Jan view the Zkevm on Zksync 2.0 now? Will Nervos get Zkevm too in 2022?

I don't think we'll see zkevm on Nervos in 2022, maybe 2023 or 2024. Our research team spend a hell lot of time on ZKP, the area is moving fast and generic ZK vm is really hard. We're always interested in the use of ZKP in layered design (see https://talk.nervos.org/t/ckb-cell/1562/19).

We now have a question from
OGchris___

Jan, can you please provide more details on what applications users can expect to come now that Nervos has laid the groundwork for fly client protocol/CKB light client?

A simple translation to the post above: layer1+2 is a interactive computing model which is far more powerful than a single turing-completeness layer. Layer 1 can be considerd as the verifier and layer 2 the prover, that's one of the reason I'm confident that layered architecture is the right way to go.

I would be excited to see the use of CKB light client in mobile, browser and embedded environment. With CKB light client on mobile we can build easy-to-use payment apps to facilitate p2p payment, based on permissionless off-chain payment network. The payment app can integrate with Unipass to support easy transfer between decentralized email-based identity, or DAS for user-friendly names and sub accounts. Any UDT, NFT or stablecoin can be transfered conveniently in a trustless and friendly way.

With CKB light client in web browser developers would be able to build trustless web or extension wallet, with no dependency on any centralized API service. Or we can build a browser extension to support visit websites with DAS names, decentralize Internet's domain name system completely.

Light client opens the door of using Nervos dapps from limited computing environment. And as many ppl may already know, it's easier to build light client protocol on PoW than PoS, because it's easier to verify objective proof of work quickly than verify subjective proof of stake.

The first step of light client plan is to build a stand alone command line tool that can synchronize with full nodes using light protocol. With the command line tool we can verify the design and fix unexpected problems. After the light client protocol stablized we can go to step 2, build more light client tools and GUI.

Next we have a question from
orenopancake

When 100% comparability b/w Godwoken &amp; Metamask?

That's the goal of Godwoken v1. My estimation is testnet launch in March and mainnet launch in Q2. Stay tuned.

For question 8 we hear from
GusTyson1

In the coming years, say 5 to 10 years from now, do you anticipate the interest rate APC you are able to pay to those of us staking in the DAO increasing to numbers comparable to projects like EGLD, DOT etc? Long-term I'd love to still be holding and getting good passive income.

Nervos DAO APC is completely different from staking yield on other chains - that's why it's called compensation not yield. It's a compensation to holders so their CKByte share are not diluted by secondary issuance. One purpuse of Nervos DAO is to create a Bitcoin-like virtual ""hardcap"" for holders. As a holder you always get the same share from new supply, but new supply rate itself is decreasing. That's why APC rate actually decrease as time goes by, and you should consider it a GOOD thing: that means CKBytes' total supply increases slower and slower, approaching zero. Nervos DAO APC is the risk-free benchmark rate. If you're willing to bear more risk for higher yield, try DeFi dapps like Yokai or Daruma on Godwoken.

Following that we had a question from
Nathan24035933

I am interested to know about force bridge to Bitcoin, any progress made?

Yes we're working on it. An asset transfer bridge is not difficult. The hard part is how to enable Bitcoin users operate Nervos dapps like we enable Ethereum users. Bitcoin lock is already done, but there's no standard dapp interface (like web3.js on Ethereum) on Bitcoin, we haven't found a proper solution here. If you have any idea let me know.

We'll see. If there's no progress at bitcoin side we'll try to move forward in our way. I think it's good for all UTXO chains.

Then we had a question from
Axieboii

Would you burn supply to increase the price to attract investors?

I think such an action is short-sighted for a layer 1 blockchain. The stability and predictability of money supply is much more important than short-term profitability. That's why we choose blockchain instead of central banking system. Besides the supply will halve in ~2023 even if we do nothing. If you still think such a burning show is necessary maybe you should forget Nervos and buy coins willing to do that.

Finally, for the last of the questions from Twitter we heard from
abdullah32553

1) CKB is limited space but isn't about 70 GB of total storage too low. 100 GB was a lot 10 years ago but not now. 

2} Is there any specific objective that 1.3 GB of 2nd issuance is aimed at? Why it is not 2 GB or 5 GB?

3} What's the reasoning behind choosing these numbers?

Good questions! ""too low"" or ""too high"" are both subjective. 70GB is enough for application use today and gives enough margin for decentralization requirements. And the ecosystem has already turned to explore SMT and L2 solutions which means majortity dapp state will be L2 state. With only high-value density assets, identities and commitments stays on layer 1, I'd argue 70GB is enough for a very long time if not forever. With that being said, it's technically possible to introduce a rate between CKByte and on-chain capacity, which makes it governance-solvable. The 1.3 GB of secondary issuance is choosen because at the 10th year since genesis, the secondary issuance will drop to &lt; 2%, while 2% is usually considered a mild inflation target. We consider the first 10 years Nervos 1st stage. After 10 years CKB inflation rate (or ""monetary policy"" if you like) will turn from mild to conservative.",cryptocurrency,1646231965.0

Bitcoin,Bitcoin as a retirement plan and transitioning to BTC net worth,"I've shared my plan before, but I'm sure this will hit a lot of new viewers so I'll post it again.

I'm on this journey to transition my net worth (not much at this point) to BTC. Here are my steps.  
(1) Start by DCA some amount every paycheck, for me this is about $40 every two weeks  
(2) Get a [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) or similar account, ideally one which pays good interest on your holdings, allows ""staking"" / hodling for higher interest rates  
   (2.1) define some limit you hold here, for example, my goal is to eventually get $4k worth of USDC and $4k of BTC in this account. Any gain, any excess off that will be xferred to a hard cold wallet for long term safe keeping

(3) Use a BTC debit card / credit card / ideally rewards card for as many purchases as possible, start getting that 1% back in BTC on purchases where you have to use fiat / cc / debit card  
(4) I haven't gotten enough stacked to begin doing this yet, but the plan is to keep track of my DCA price. When I get a paycheck, DCA buy in. When it comes time to pay bills I'll look at my DCA price vs actual BTC price. If BTC is lower than DCA,, it sucks to cash out to pay bills and take what feels like a loss. So instead, I'll pay out of my USDC balance. Monitor price and when BTC comes above DCA price at that time sell enough to re-balance USDC back to where it ought to be in reserve.  


On average, as I believe BTC rises in the long term, my BTC holding DCA price will regularly (eventually always, if price gets high enough) be below the actual BTC price and at that point I'll be transitioned. 100% of paychecks go to BTC and 100% of my bills get paid by cashing out BTC.

Eventually, the goal is that I never need USDC or fiat or credit cards as an intermediary and can just trade BTC directly with goods and service providers but we're simply not there yet, so in the meantime this is the best option I've found.

Finally, the retirement portion. I'm already an old man. There will come a day when I'm not able to do my 9-5 consistently anymore and need to retire. I have some fiat plans in place, but this is the way I'm looking at it.

I am hoping to live 20 years after I retire  
20 years at roughly $2k living expenses monthly = $480k  
The best part about BTC for retirement, I believe, is that it's deflationary and that I won't actually have to have the whole $480k stacked to retire because in year 1 it might be worth $480k but if I spend half of that over the course of 10years I actually expect the price of BTC to easily go up 50% in those 10 years, so my $240k remaining would actually be at least $360k

The growth of Bitcoin and it's price are going to be impossible to predict, so I don't want to be *too* speculative and optimistic, but my goal is $200k worth of BTC saved, at that time I think I will be able to safely retire and if my BTC runs out I'll be poorer but I'll still be able to live.

$200k is a lot and I have a long way to go to save that much, but with my transition to BTC as a lifestyle and stacking in a HW wallet, I actually believe I'll make it. I 100% expect BTC to 10x within the next 5 years, meaning that $200k worth of BTC 5 years from now can be bought today for $20k.

Thinking like that makes me think it's possible. Maybe it's a pipe dream, maybe BTC won't be so successful, maybe it will be successful but it will be a lot slower. I'm still not expecting to retire for more than 5 years, so maybe it's 15 years until retirement and maybe I only get to live off BTC for 10 good years instead of 20, but this is my plan and I think it's my best shot.

personalfinance,Home Buying Questions - Mortgage,"Hello! Before I start I want to say I did check out the FAQ for 25-35 and the home buying section.

My fiance and I are applying for mortgages and I had a couple questions. We are first time home buyers (22f/23m), moving to MI. (Employer paying for full pack movers, shipment, and partial unpack)

250k budget w/ abo 25k wiggle room (not ideal but doable) and 30k down payment (not including closing costs unless they're above like 5k). We've worked hard to get where we are at.

Total debts: 13k student loans, +2 credit cards that we use for necessities that get paid off every month. 

We are getting approved for the amount we want 275k to give a little bit of wiggle room on the top end. Realistically we can 'afford' a 350k-ish home without going over the recommended 35% debt-income ratio, but we don't need that much house nor want to spend that much every month. 

We have two approvals back rn, for same loan amount, slightly different interest rates, and I would love some insight as to how to compare pre-approvals and how to decide on one.

We are applying with Wells Fargo, prime lending, and rocket mortgage because they all have a deal with new employer and offer benefits such as free underwriting etc., and then our bank, Huntington.

As far as general 'vibe' I so much prefer Wells Fargo and prime lending simply because they have been incredibly helpful, kind, and patient when it comes to us stumbling through all these steps as young adults, and first time home buyers.

I'm not a fan of rocket mortgage's general handling of this situation, I felt a little tricked into applying because I was only made to realize after that I wasn't doing a consult but doing the actual mortgage application which was about 4 months too early for us to apply to other mortgages (RM approvals last for 6 months compared to usual 60-90 days). In turn and because our down payment money wasn't in the right account at the time, it became a mess and I'm still sorting it out.

But my questions:

What's the best way to compare pre-approvals?I feel like I'm throwing darts at a blank wall. 

What are the BIG things to judge a mortgage lender on?

Why did you ultimately decide on your lender?

I cannot find anything that gives me a good expectation for closing costs, what 'fees' are junk? How much of it is negotiable? How much should we expect to be paying??

What are some unexpected costs that came up when you bought your house we should prepare for? Other than property taxes, etc.

Any other words of wisdom for young newlyweds moving out of their home state?

Working with 1 broker who's telling me the best bet is a 10 year ARM for my situation. That will get me down around 3.25% (A full point) if I open a checking account with their bank. Seems risky with rates going back up. He said he doesn't have anything competitive to what the 1st broker was offering.

1st broker has me looking at another 30 year fixed which would lower my monthly payments by $130-ish and comes in at 3.7-ish% interest rate, or a 20 year fixed which would add $48 to my monthly but give me a 3.5-ish% rate. Net savings is around $19k over 20 years.

I assumed I'd be able to get down a full percentage point more easily. What confuses me is looking at the (fixed 20 year) 3 year break even mark on the calculator it says $-64.

stocks,US stocks rebound as Powell says he supports 25 basis point hike in March,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday said the central bank intends to raise its policy interest rate by a quarter-percentage point following the end of its two-day meeting on March 16, despite uncertainties from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month,” Powell said, in remarks prepared for delivery to the House Financial Services Committee.

Later, under questioning from lawmakers, Powell said he was inclined to support a 25 basis point move.Most economists had penciled in a quarter-point at the March meeting. Speculation of a half-percentage point hike has waned in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Fed is expected to continue to raise rates throughout the year. Powell said he wanted to proceed “carefully,” which is likely a signal of further quarter-point moves. But the Fed chairman said larger rate hikes were on the table if inflation doesn’t subside.

“To the extent inflation comes in higher or is more persistently high…then we would be prepared to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings,” Powell said. The central bank’s policy rate has been stuck near zero since the coronavirus pandemic struck in early 2022 to help the economy weather the storm.

With inflation surging, the central banks wants — as the first order of business — to get rates closer to “neutral” or around a 2.5% rate, in orderly and regular steps. Powell’s comments Wednesday show the Fed doesn’t want to surprise the market with its policy moves.

Powell told the committee the Fed will have to be “nimble” in its execution of monetary policy. The Ukraine war was a big reason to move carefully, he said. The Fed has a second tool to cool the economy — shrinking the size of its almost $9 trillion balance sheet. Powell said he expects the Fed to “make progress on agreeing on a plan to shrink the balance sheet” and the question of when to implement it “is not answered yet.”

The Fed wants to shrink its balance sheet “in a predictable manner” primarily letting maturing securities run off of its portfolio, rather than outright sales, he said.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Thankfully managed to make a couple of profitable trades, especially on spy! Now let's see what is waiting for us in near future and the reason behind today's rise.

&amp;#x200B;

1) We rose today due to yesterday's SOTU where Biden emphasized the importance of dropping costs for the middle-class which made people happy, due to the high inflation everyone was triggered by high prices so he managed to hit a sweet spot!

&amp;#x200B;

2) FED's Powell talked about how the U.S is not going to directly get affected by the Russian sanctions and that OIL prices are not a threat. He also mentioned that inflation is somehow under-control.

&amp;#x200B;

3) The unemployment data came out pretty positive! We are up in employment which was triggered by high manufacturing + retail sales.

&amp;#x200B;

Outcome: Let's sell some short-term put spreads, lads and gents!

Alright Caldoon, but what the hell to expect next week or next month?

&amp;#x200B;

1) Don't expect Macro-Economy to just forget what have had happened in these past few days. The long-term effect of sanctions will definitely be negative and the USO is still rising although it dropped a bit. U.S and Europe are banning Russian gas and oil from everywhere and that will definitely drag Europe down soon, U.S might stay reluctant for a while due to OIL reserves but even then like we mentioned, USO is rising!

&amp;#x200B;

2) The inter-bank loan system called Swap Lines which are used by banks to lend each other money had a huge rate increase. That was due to uncertainty and fear in the market. No bank felt confident to pull out cash and lend it to anyone. It was feared that this might bring Financial Sector down which would drag the whole SP500 with it but thankfully for now it chilled down. However, the sanctions and its negative effects might drag it up again.

&amp;#x200B;

3) No matter what Powell says inflation is still high, the savings rate in consumers is very low which means people are not really left with much money in their pocket. That will definitely affect Q1 2022 retail sales

&amp;#x200B;

4) Not just retail sales but whole GDP is forecasted to show 0% growth, repeating myself, it is expected that we will have zero growth. That is scary isn't it? High inflation Low growth and volatile unemployment, that might bring the stagflation (recession) in the game which we mentioned in previous post.

I was going to pay a big lump sum of $6000 before interest resumes. After doing some research. I'll take about 3 years off the loan, but I'll only save like $2000 over the life of the loan. That doesn't seem like a good trade off to me.

This is based on my previous payment $450/month with the original payoff date being in 2041.

I'd rather fund a Roth IRA. I currently have a retirement plan with my company as well. 

*Retirement age is 60 (I'm 31) and guaranteed 92.5% of my highest 5 successive years of income and 75% health insurance paid when I retire for the rest of my life. I have a 1 year emergency fund, and I invest about 5% of my income in stocks. Currently use Stash and have a smart portfolio with an aggressive risk right now. I  can also contribute the max to an IRA starting this year. 

I currently work in the public sector and qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). I have 2 years towards the 10 so far.  8 more years seems like a long time, but my payments are significantly lower ($139 month) because I'm not on the standard 10 year plan and haven't recertified since I started working again. I can pay more than the minimum ($750 month), but according to online calculators I'd still be paying for 8 years. Just doesn't seem to make sense to me to pay more when the rest will be forgiven in the same time frame. I plan to just invest the extra payments instead. 

Does this sound good? Any advice is welcomed.

***Update***

My payments are expected to be $450/month when I re-certify next year.

My payments will never exceed the monthly payment of $750 because that's how much it would have been on a standard 10 year repayment plan.",finance,1646249397.0
personalfinance,Looking to buy new car in 2022 - insight on how to approach given my situation?,"So I know that it isn't the ideal time to buy a car in 2022 with all the shortages - my intention was always to get a CPO car when the time came. But with the crazy market for used cars, it seems like the consensus is that buying new is the way to go if you have some flexibility/patience and don't \*NEED\* a car immediately - am I right so far?

My situation is that I bought an old 2004 Lexus ES 330 back in 2015 and it's on it's last legs... it's getting to the point where it's hard to justify spending $500+ on a repair when the car is only worth a few thousand. So I've been researching a bunch of cars and I'm heavily leaning towards a Hyundai Tucson Hybrid. I'll still want to find a dealership to test drive one as I haven't gotten to that step in the process yet.

I've never been a big car person so I'm definitely not the most knowledgable about all the specs/mechanical stuff when it comes to cars. I'm happy to listen to anyone's opinion or experience with the Tucson hybrid, but I also don't want to get too caught up with the make/model of the car, as that's not really the point of the post. I've done enough research and I'm fairly satisfied with what I came up with - the only slight question mark to be is the reliability of the make/model, as Hyundai doesn't quite get the unanimous glowing reviews for reliability that Toyota/Honda get, but it seems that it is generally considered a reliable brand that isn't too costly to repair(?) My perspective is that every make/model has their hit and misses - so if I'm buying a 2022 vehicle without a history of issues to analyze, it's going to be a bit of a crapshoot anyway. I also read to stay away from any new Hyundais that were incorporating the new CVT from Toyota and/or Kia(?) as it was known to have issues, but when I read through the specs it seems the Tucson hybrid does not have this CVT so I should not have to worry - idk this is getting to the details that are somewhat over my head lol.

&amp;#x200B;

But to my main point/question - ironically I'm an engineer even though I'm not super into/knowledgable about cars lol, but I'm very good with numbers. I have a pretty solid grasp on my finances and what I can afford. Ultimately, I want to make sure I get the best deal/potential financing on a car, and not get overwhelmed or confused by all the sales-person talk. I could practically buy the car up front if I wanted to, but as someone who values investing my money, I want to take advantage of any potential good financing deals and good interest rates.

I have excellent (800+) credit, and I've been leaning towards putting down anywhere from $10k-20k down, and financing the rest (MSRP is just over 30k, hoping I won't have to go much over MSRP). When I'm looking at financing deals online, I'm seeing things like ""0% APR for 48 months"" - am I misunderstanding things, or are they really offering 0% interest rates for financing? I've also read a bunch of different ""car buying guides"", but there's always a ton of conflicting information. And it seems that the whole sales environment is different these days so anything older than like 6 months may be irrelevant. Has anyone had luck with the whole 'email all the dealerships in the area for best ""out the door price"" and leverage them against each other until you have the lowest price?"" Also, given that I want to finance part of the purchase, how can I avoid getting caught up in any sales tactics/fine print tricks? Is it still best to finance through a bank or credit union rather than the dealership? If you go this route, are you basically just taking out a separate loan and then buying the car at the dealership with cash? Is this really better than the 0% APR loans that dealerships claim to be offering?

Ultimately, if you were in my situation given the information I've provided, how would you proceed to approach buying &amp; negotiating for a car?",finance,1646250598.0

Obviously the first choice would be to buy as much foreign currency as possible, but as you would expect there are serious shortages of all foreign currencies in Russia at the moment, and no one wants to buy rubles. The price decreases daily. Most online currency exchanges that we've found have blocked the trading of rubles completely.

The bank's advice has been to keep the money in the bank as interest rates are currently at 18%, but with the ruble dropping 30% in a matter of days that's not much consolation. 

I suggested buying stablecoins but she has no experience with crypto and it seems like a risky time to enter unknown territory. I haven't checked but it's possible that crypto traders may have blocked the ruble as well anyway.

The one saving grace is that she works for a foreign company and her wage is calculated on the value of the dollar, not the ruble, so her wage is actually staying level while everyone else's is going down, but that doesn't do much to help her savings.

personalfinance,Offer from my uncle's bank -- is it a good deal?,"Hi -

So, I've been been saving and finally have the cash for a down payment to buy a home. I'm really upset of course about house prices sky rocketing, but what can you do. However, what's must frustrating to me is the recent rise in interest rates.

I was looking at a properly at $489K. One month ago, with the interest rate I had (2.7% with 20% down payment), I would have been paying $1,933 a month of a 30 year fixed mortgage. However I waited too long (getting down the payment together) and lost my rate lock. Now, I'm looking at $2,191 monthly with a 3.9% rate - about $250 more per month. I was at the limits of my budget before (with a safety margin), and now I don't think I can safely carry the higher rate.

My uncle owns a small bank in Georgia. He is offering me a deal: his bank could help me with a second mortgage that will equal my down payment of 20% (basically letting me get to a 40% down payment against the primary loan of 60% of the value). In exchange, I would owe my uncle's bank 20% of the value of the house when I sell it. He (through his bank) basically is willing to own 20% of my house, unleveraged.

The exciting part of the deal is I would have monthly payments of only $1,730 while means I would both be able to buy the house and have a little extra cash flow free for improvements / other. And, essentially I would have the house at a 25:75 leverage with my primary loan (my 20% against the bank's 60% primary mortgage).

I love my uncle - but, what I want to know is whether this is a good deal. Should I take my uncle up on the offer?

personalfinance,Homeownership: where to go now,"So last year my now wife and I were scrambling to try and buy a house. Prices in our area (like most) were going crazy and we were getting outbid left and right. We finally came across a place that was sitting on the market for awhile and at the time, we thought it was sitting because the price was listed way too high. We put in an offer that was accepted. 

After our home inspection, there was several little things that weren’t particularly concerning, but they also said the roof needed to be replaced. The home inspection noted that the previous owners had put a concrete roof on a home not originally designed for that (concrete is a lot more heavy then shingles). The home inspector pointed out some framing sagging that had happened from this in the garage, but made it sound like this was something to just keep an eye on. We negotiated down slightly, to address the cumulative repairs but weren’t considerably concerned with the framing situation because we believed it was minor and only in the garage. Since then we have had people look at the framing/roof and tell us we are looking at an over 125k repair between the roof and framing repairs over the entire house. 

Now we are left wondering where do we go from here. We certainly don’t have that kind of money sitting around so we would need to take a loan out to cover this size of project. With us concerned that things are going to get worse, especially if we get a big snowfall, it’s something we want to address ASAP. 

What we have going for us is we purchased our house for about 440 (with a really low interest rate) and the market has climbed a lot here. Websites like Zillow and Redfin estimate a property value of ~580. Would it be wiser to take a loan to cover as much as we can and cut our loses or possibly sell the house as is for considerably less than market value? We likely wouldn’t be left with much after that and will need to downsize but I don’t think we have many options these days. 

All I can say is that the biggest thing we learned in this process is homes only build wealth if you buy a good quality home 😅 and paying for a good home inspector can save you from ending up in a stressful situation like ours.

personalfinance,How to Divide a Bonus Between Different Types of Debt,"I currently have two main types of debt, credit cards and installment loans; nothing insurmountable due to the blessing of a good career, but I’m a bit oblivious when it comes to how to prioritize applying financial windfalls towards which debts. Case in point, I’m switching jobs and getting (after taxes) around a $22k signing bonus. I have about 18k in credit card debt and another 10k in installment loans. The credit cards have an interest rate in the low 20’s, the installment loans are astronomically higher since they were effectively payday loans, my state just doesn’t let you call them that.

Ultimately I want to use the bonus in a way that will most positively impact my credit score, as in the next few years I’ll need that score significantly higher to qualify for our next home loan. I’m told that aside from on-time payments (where my history is excellent), the 2nd highest weighted factor in credit score is your utilization %, and that installment loans don’t count towards that. So it would seem the most bang for my buck from a credit score improvement standpoint would be putting the bulk of the bonus money towards the credit cards.

On the flip side, I hear a lot of people say to use something called the snowball method, paying the smallest debts first and working your way up from there. I’ve also heard, for obvious reasons, that the highest interest debts should be paid down first. Both of these arguments favor paying the installment loans before the credit cards as those interest rates are asinine and the #’s on each loan are very modest. The monthly repayments are also very high, so that route would have the added bonus of immediately adding more breathing room to my monthly budget. 

As somebody who is learning personal finance on the fly (and will not make the same dumb mistakes accruing all this debt again), what’s the best way to apply the bonus and prioritize these debts? CC’s, loans, or a mix of the two? Everything is current for whatever that’s worth.

personalfinance,Pay down debt or keep saving for a house?,"Sorry for the long list but I feel like we're at a financial crossroads and I am not sure which way to go. We were just pushed out of a home purchase offer by a multiple counter with two other buyers that pushed the purchase price $50,000 over the original ask. We were already $36,000 over ask. One of the other buyers has an escalation clause 2,000 higher than the counter. We all know the housing market is insane right now, and I feel like we're in kind of a hopeless situation where I live because the influx of people with way more buying power than me and my husband are flocking here in droves. See above scenario. This is happening with every house on the market in my area. Our reason for looking to buy now is because we are in a condo and would really like to get into a single family home for the long term. 

So here is our situation. We have a lot of equity in our home, giving us the ability to put about 40% down on a new home and keep within our target monthly payment. We have no credit card debt, and a few small 0% interest payment plans, two of the three which are phones. Our biggest debts other than our mortgage are our car payments. Three vehicles which we owe $9000, $21,000, and $23,000. The largest of the three is 0% interest. 

Our original thought was to take $250,000 of our profit and apply to a new house and use the remaining approx. $50,000 for any small changes we would make to a new place (like adding AC or switching from an electric stove to gas). Then take the remainder and pay off at least one of the vehicles, hopefully two. This would free up an additional $300-$800 per month in our budget. We have about $5000 in savings and $2000 in a Wealthfront account. Plus a reserve medical account that would cover the deductible on a major medical expense. Have gotten a start on retirement, but it's not great   

I've done the 30% calculation for what we should expend on a home and that says we should only pay about $1900/month. We can't even rent a place here for that number. Our current mortgage is about $1400. We were maxed out before the counter offer at about a $2200/month payment. 

We putt away $1000/ month into our  ""house fund"" that we started about a year ago as a dummy payment for what our target monthly would be. We had to cut into what we had for some unforseen expenses, but are still putting away every monthand it is currently reserved as earnest money. If we get lucky. 

Would we be better off to apply that monthly dummy payment toward paying down our cars to free up more of our debt to income? Better to keep it for earnest money on a new house? We were going to put $5000 down if we got our offer accepted. I would like to keep that in reserve in case something else comes up. But at this rate, houses selling for so much more over asking  might push us out anyway. So I guess the question is, should we take that $1000/ month and use it to pay down debt instead of hoarding it in a non-earning account? We're afraid of being priced out of the area my husband and I both grew up in entirely, or otherwise be stuck in our condo for the rest of our lives, especially with how interest rates are projected to go up.",finance,1646281553.0

Jerome Powell is now warning us that the consequences of this war between Ukraine and Russia will make the situation more than uncertain for the American economy. With two weeks to go before the next Fed FOMC meeting, we have the feeling that Jerome Powell is preparing to tell us that the Fed does not want to change its monetary policy as expected.

This war seems to be the perfect justification to get the consent of the people to continue printing fiat money out of thin air in a massive way. Inflation will continue to be very high, but everyone will be talking about the war. The attention of the general public will be diverted from this major issue.

If it goes that way, we can expect the price of Bitcoin to go much higher in the coming months.",cryptocurrency,1646291597.0

economy,Russia's financial crisis in a nutshell.,"Obviously, people know what happened with Ruble. 30% value down, that is absolutely crazy. A very despondent situation that Putin probably deserved. Not the best situation for Russia banks right now. Russian citizens can't ride a subway because of Apple pay there has stopped working.

I'll be just talking about some other, trivial stuff about how Russia is doing. Maybe all people knows this, but, yeah. I just felt like talking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, Russia currently has around $135 billion of external debt;  $33 billion of debt owed alone, far more than Russia's $12 billion of foreign exchange reserves right now. 

Extreme concerns of a country going default on debts! 

To those who don't know, defaulting means basically not being able to pay their debts, and the whole economy collapses, increasing exchange and interest rate in astronomical numbers. The way to solve is by postponing the debt, or devaluing their own currency.

Moreover, after the Russian banks were expelled from the SWIFT system, Putin's $630 billion foreign exchange reserves to deal with Western sanctions were also useless. Russia has the world's second largest trading volume through SWIFT after the United States. Two-thirds of the $400 billion in foreign exchange reserves became useless. A money only existing in the book.

In addition, it is difficult to freely use the remaining 1/3 of the foreign exchange reserves. Of the remaining foreign exchange reserves, about 60%, or about $140 billion, is gold, so it is difficult to sell in many ways, and . If you sell Chinese bonds approximately 35% or about $84 billion worth of money, you can only get Chinese Yuan, which you can't use outside of China. Therefore, the Russian Central Bank currently has only $12 billion of money at its disposal. This is less than half of the official foreign exchange reserves of the Republic of Korea during the 1997 foreign exchange crisis.

 Credit rating agency Fitch downgraded Russia's credit rating from 'BBB' to 'B' and placed it on 'negative observation'. Moody's downgraded Russia's rating from 'Baa3' to 'B3'. In particular, Fitch pointed out that it is the first time since Korea during the 1997 Asian financial crisis that the country's credit rating has been lowered by six places at a time.",finance,1646299676.0
personalfinance,"Should I put $6,000 more down on a car or put it into my Roth IRA","Hello. I am planning to buy a car soon and am currently debating one of two options. Option 1: Put $9,000 down own on a car in which the final OTD price of 33,000, interest rate of 2.99%, 72 month term or Option 2: put only $3,000 down and put the other $6,000 into my Roth IRA at the end of the month, with the interest rate on the loan still being at 2.99%.

I am leaning more towards option #2. While only putting a $3,000 down payment has a higher monthly payment, with only a 2.99% interest rate on the loan, I figured that having a tax free growth of the $6,000 in my Roth IRA will likely lead to a me earning more money than I will end up paying interest on the loan for having a higher monthly payment. \[Granted there is always the risk I lose money instead\] Does this make sense?

EDIT: 

thank you everyone so much for your inputs. I realize now how off I was about everything but now I know and I’m so relieved. I’m still learning but you all helped a lot in narrowing it down for me. Here’s my take from all the comments: 


Checking account 
 - use local bank or credit union / same bank as HYSA

High-yield savings account 
- can also use for general savings &amp;amp;amp;amp; emergency funds
- look into online bank Ally (no brick and mortar buildings BUT higher savings interest rate) 

Roth IRA 
- open with low-cost broker Vanguard and invest all money (for the first many years at least) in VTSAX (a low-cost index fund which is balanced over the whole market) 

Credit card 
- start w/ a simple one &amp;amp;amp;amp; a low limit before qualifying for a better one
- pay card off in full every month 
- after having it for 6 months to a year, call bank and ask that the limit be raised, but still spend as if it were low (this will help build credit &amp;amp;amp;amp; could save on interest rates when I take out a car loan or mortgage one day)

Income : Dual income of \~$11,500/month after taxes and 401k contribution  
Debt : \~500/month (car payment). No credit card or student loan debt

Savings\~$80,000 cash on hand\~$160k tied up in post tax brokerage account(401k and wifes pension not listed since it's retirement)

Current life plan  
we plan on having 1 child in about 2 years. We'd like to place them in a location with a well rated school. I ideally plan on making a career change in 10-15 years which will likely cut our take home income quite a bit.

We both like to prioritize living well below our means in able to save aggressively for retirement and just general financial security.

Current options  
\-Keep renting for now, we could comfortably rent at \~2k/month, invest cash on hand, invest pretty aggressively, and have money to comfortably afford childcare (which looks like \~$2k/month where we live), and then buy a house later in life  
\-Buy in a nearby lower cost of living area. This area has a really well rated elementary school, but the middle school and high school are terrible. The area itself we like ""okay"". A house runs 500k-550k, with property tax and insurance on a 30 year loan and 10% down we'd be looking at about \~$3,200/month, and probably moving after \~12-13 years once we have a child about to enter middle school  
\-Buy in our ideal higher COL area. The area would have well rated schools and be very close to my wifes work. The houses are older and more expensive, usually 700-800k for a very ""regular"" 3bd2b. If we put 20% down and did a 15 year loan, we'd be out a majority of our cash but we'd be in a neighborhood we could stay at long term (schools are all great, nice town, very close to work). If the house was paid off, it would make my future career shift pretty painless

Our real estate agent has been telling us that we're too conservative and that we can afford more, but we really like the security that comes with a lower cost of living. Part of our intimidation is that houses in these areas are going 10-15% over asking to actually ""get"" the house, and if the house doesn't appraise then that 10-15% needs to come as cash out of pocket  


We don't really *need* to buy a house and buying a house kind of feels like FOMO'ing into the market, given how much interest rates and housing prices have been increasing. On the flip side continuing to rent feels like timing the market, and waiting for a ""better"" opportunity that may never come. I just can't imagine that this market of asking 10-15% over asking can be sustainable after nearly 50%  increase in price of homes over the last 2 years.

Bitcoins from 10 years ago can still move using the original protocol.

I've read that there can be same-year or next-year tax advantages for basically passing money through a 529 to offset taxable scholarships.  I don't understand how so if anyone has insight please let me know.  Articles like [this from Kiplinger](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/college/t002-c001-s001-the-529-plan-scholarship-exception.html) talk about using ""aged"" 529 money to offset scholarships, but nothing about a magic pass-through.  My reading says a 529 works a lot like a Roth and is already taxed money- the benefit is no taxes on the growth which wouldn't apply in the short-term case I describe.

Situation:

Summary- Parents use our after-tax, regular income to pay about $30,000 towards two kids' college, most of this goes to non-deductible room and board.  We receive about $4,500 AOTC.  One student pays $2200 tax on a $10,000 scholarship.

Question:  Can a new 529 plan be used in some manner to reduce taxes, especially on the scholarship?

Details:

Student 1 has 3 more calendar years (including 2022) undergrad and potential grad school.  For undergrad they receive a $10,000 merit scholarship that is taxable because it's used for room and board.  Although it's on their tax return, it is subject to the ""baby tax"" meaning they pay at the parents' top marginal rate of 22% federal, 8% state.  Most of their tuition and some of their housing is covered by aid from the school and we pay out of pocket a total of about $10,000 which covers some tuition so we can take $2000 of the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)

Student 2 has 4 more calendar years (including 2022) undergrad and potential grad school.  For undergrad they receive a scholarship that covers most of their tuition, we pay the remainder (and take the full $2500 AOTC) along with about $15,000 for room, board, etc.

Parents are married, file joint returns, taxable income about $100k which is into the 22% federal and 8% state tax brackets.  We have money in 401k and will be able to access it probably next year (retirement using Rule of 55) or if I don't retire then, I can draw late 2024 (age 59-1/2).

I currently have 2 credit cards:

* Discover It Miles - Balance: $22K (Credit Line: $29K, APR 22.9%)
* Capital One Quicksilver - Balance: $1K (Credit Line: $7K, APR 22.9%)

I currently pay the minimum payment + an additional $150-$200 (depending on the month) toward each card. I'm obviously more immediately concerned about the Discover card balance - the Capital One is a lot more manageable, and therefore has lower interest fees and minimum payments.

EDIT: I understand that the interest rates are the same - but since the Capital One balance is lower, the interest fee is lower compared to the interest fees incurred on my high Discover card balance. 

I just got an offer from my bank for a pre-approved credit card with a 0% promotional APR for the first 15 billing cycles on balance transfers. A balance transfer fee also applies, either $10 or 4% of each transfer, whichever is greater.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: *What is the best way to utilize a deal like this to my advantage?*

i.e. Is there a 'magic number' to transfer from my Discover card to a new credit line that will allow me to most efficiently pay down my debt? Is it better to transfer a portion of the balance to the new card so that I can strategically pay down that amount with no interest before the promotional APR ends, and then have a low to zero balance on the new card at the end of the 15 billing cycles? Or would it be better to transfer the entire balance and pay down as much as I can? Or maybe transfer half of the balance, pay down as much as possible, and then have lower minimum payments/ overall balances on each card to help boost my credit score and lessen the monthly burden?

OR -&gt; Is this a bad idea overall?

&amp;#x200B;

CryptoCurrency,How will crypto handle stagflation?,"If an embargo on Russia's exports extends due to the conflict in Ukraine, it might lead to an oil supply crunch like during the '60s-'70s oil crisis, which in turn may end up fueling a period of both rising consumer prices and lackluster growth. 

Cursory study of historical graphs implies to me that gold was a decently safe investment during the '70s stagflation era; I fear that crypto remains a speculative asset and will not offer the same performance if the economy tanks in a similar manner today. I guess it will depend on how the federal banks react to the conundrum; if they choose to keep the rates low to support growth at the cost of increased inflation, crypto might be a valid investment.

personalfinance,Advice : Bartender/Server Tax withholding calcification,"Hello, I am a part time bartender. This year I worked for a bar and they reported our total wage + tips and told us our paychecks would cover all of our taxes . Anyway, they took the percentage out for SS and MC out of gross hourly wage +tips but only subtracted it from the gross pay and then there was usually nothing left or not much left to withhold from the check for federal taxes. Sometimes the check would come back as negative or zero and they wouldn’t reduce federal tax at all. 

Just wondering if this kind of thing is correct ? I’m not mad just think it’s weird to calculate it that way &amp; looking for clarification. Here’s some examples of what they did to calculate is from their cpa 

“Using her their paycheck of the year, it was 4/23/21”
Hours worked = 28*2.13=59.64
Reported Tips = 604.00
Total Pay = 663.64
SS Calc = 663.64*.062=41.15
MC Calc = 663.64*.0145 = 9.62
Fed WH = 8.87
Gross Pay 59.64 less deductions 41.15-9.62-8.87 = Zero
The program has fully calculated SS &amp; MC and used the rest of the check for Fed WH.”
This is when the check was negative :
Hours worked = 12*2.13=25.56
Reported Tips = 368.00
Total Pay = 393.56
SS Calc = 393.56*.062=24.40
MC Calc = 393.56*.0145 = 5.71
Fed WH = 0
Gross Pay 25.56 less deductions – 24.40-5.71-0=(4.55)
Since there cannot be a negative paycheck, the SS contribution is reduced to 19.85 so that the net check is zero.",finance,1646341276.0

personalfinance,Confused About My Tax Amount Owed,"Hello,

This post is primarily about Federal US Taxes, although my State Taxes are in a similar situation. I have very simple taxes, I file as Single and take the Standard Deduction, in the past I itemized but it never came close to the Standard so I just take that. Since this has some delicate financial information I've opted for a throwaway account.

This year I was told I owe about $500 in Federal and $700 in State. I ran this through 2-3 free Tax Filers (from the IRS Website) just to be sure I didn't screw something up. In the past I've typically gotten a small refund from the Federal Taxes, maybe a few hundred, and owed a medium amount of State, usually $500 or in that ballpark.

What I'm not understanding is why the amount I owe has gone up. Last year I did receive a raise at work but I also upped my taxes, 401K contribution, and HSA contribution to manage that. I also had a brief job, one month, but Taxes were taken out per the statement I was sent at the end of the year.

My bracket is  22% for 2021, which didn't change from the year prior even with my raise and the extra job. I even ran my current years numbers through the IRS Calculator and it says I should have a refund, although some of the information requests are foggy so I likely didn't enter everything 100% correctly. Still, I'm puzzled as to why I now owe so much when I never have and took steps to prevent that from happening.

Here are my raw numbers, perhaps someone can tell me where I've gone wrong. Otherwise my next step was to take up one of the ""free"" tax review services and just not file with them but see if they come up with different numbers.

Couple mechanisms in mind that would affect APY measured in USD:

1. If crypto returns have to be competitive with physical world returns, I would expect crypto returns to rise to maintain the higher risk / reward ratio
2. If crypto returns are most dependent on the value of assets being given as 'interest' (particularly governance tokens), then it seems that as 'risk' assets fall in price due to higher interest rates, interest paid in those assets would fall in value thereby reducing the USD APY

Subject: Re: Verify your email address - Account verification reminder

Basically says (with shitty grammar) that his account is suspended from trading until he clicks a link and verifies his info. It's sent from an obviously bs email address. He recognizes it as spam and deletes. This afternoon -  a day later -  he gets another ""coinbase"" email that's even more obvious it's a phishing email.

Thing is, he never went to coinbase.com until tonight... so he somehow had his email address associated with coinbase at some point before ever searching for or going to coinbase. Thus, I'm concerned that it was my email to him mentioning coinbase that got him targeted. He swears he's never looked into coinbase until tonight, and has not used his personal email address for anything recently. I checked my emails and spam folders and have seen nothing similar to what he's gotten. As a test, I'm sending myself (to another email address) the same email I sent my father yesterday; we'll see if that address gets a phishing email in the near term.

But in the email it says the decal is magnetic. So $1100 to lay a magnet on the door??

This makes me postulate that rate hikes have a higher negative impact on OpEx compared to that on CapEx, since rate hikes might not have the same impact on the longer term debt compared to shorter term. However, the question is if the effects are drastically different, or not.    

For eg. is the impact on CapEx minimal enough that firms do not have to worry about it in their investment decisions, or because of the long duration effect, CapEx ends up having a significant impact, whereas although OpEx will get higher, it will get incurred anyway since it is like oxygen that the firm has to consume, and in comparison, firms and hence investors would worry more about the impact of rates on CapEx rather than OpEx...?",finance,1646388015.0

investing,We need to upgrade ESG Standarts to avoid investments in countries with low democracy (Russia/ China),"In the background of the events in Ukraine the importance of the ESG agenda is growing rapidly.

Some investors are concerned with ethical component of the issue: no one really wants to be involved in financing of shelling and bombing of civil districts. Other investors are concerned with the financial part of the problem, because sanctions are really depreciating the asset base.

The discussion on ESG investment efficiency in comparison with the broad market is still non-finalized (example [Aswath Damodoran](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/09/sounding-good-or-doing-good-skeptical.html)). But investment inefficiency in regiemes with low democracy now becomes more transparent. After the military invasion in Ukraine of the Russian Federation, the Russian market lost 75% of its market value. The Chinese economy depreciated about 35% from the beginning of 2021.

This statement is also confirmed by dozens of research articles (first of all by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson), who affirm the statement that high-quality social institutes are the cause of economic prosperity. On the other hand, the lack of these institutes causes a lot of economic problems.

So, ESG standards should be upgraded. ESG standards should include indications that could evaluate risks, which are tied to lack of democracy and high-quality social institutes.

 This problem shines with ESG ranking systems. According to [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/yndx/sustainability), Russian IT company Yandex (NASDAQ: YNDX) has lower ESG risks than most US companies. This issue became possible because of lack of political risk analysis. 

How can we upgrade ESG Standards? 

For example, Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF (Ticker: FRDM) includes only assets from countries, that meet following criteria:

\- **civil freedom**, such as absence of terrorism, human trafficking, torture, disappearances and detainments;

\- **political freedom**, such as rule of law, due process, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly;

This would help you avoid such crises in the future from ethical and investment standpoints. Unfortunately, today not all countries are united and confronting Russian aggression against Ukraine. A Vivid Example is China with lack of democracy.

CryptoCurrency,Letter to IRS,"I spoke with a friend’s spouse, someone who works at the IRS, to give an overview of crypto, for a newcomer. It lasted 90 minutes on Zoom and covered most of the basics. Below is the email I am about to send (this is the morning after). Looking for feedback, please.


Name,

What we discussed last night was extremely broad, and I am aware that much was likely left out. And I feel that I would be doing you a disservice if I didn't follow up just a bit to address this!

Blockchain: as blocks age, it's as though they are coated with additional layers of amber; this means that if there is a mistake in the latest block or two, it is possible that those blocks could get edited or replaced, if the network agrees. However, once several blocks (for Bitcoin, say) have been produced, they are considered unalterable. Best practice, therefore, is to wait 3 blocks (~30 minutes) after sending a Bitcoin transaction before considering it complete.
This Immutability of the blocks goes with the Scarcity of the coin and Trustless nature of the network; it's a feature, not a bug.
The timing (eg: 30 minutes for BTC) is based on the heartbeat of the specific blockchain; some are extremely quick!

Interest Rates: I'm not sure if I made a strong case here, but interest rate yields in the crypto universe (cryptoverse) for depositors are much higher than those of existing financial institutions. This is helping to draw participation from individuals of all income levels. Crypto lenders and standard banks, as I understand it, both issue short-term loans to institutions for high yields. The difference is, banks keep most of the profit, only offering a fraction of a percent as interest to its depositors. The nature of smart contracts and digital currency is such that crypto lenders ensure that a much larger chunk of those earned interest rates are passed on to depositors.
This is critical to small net worth individuals, and will put pressure on fiat banks to offer more attractive rates (these are good things)
Fiat banks (as well as institutions, companies, and even sovereign nations) are already amassing and using crypto
Some examples of the better lending platforms in crypto: Celsius, BlockFi, Crypto.com, Ledn (not a misspelling), Voyager, Nexo, to name just a few

Regulation: Crypto needs smart regulation in order to grow. Larger and more conservative institutions are waiting on the sidelines, watching as less risk-averse companies jump in. When China clamped down on crypto, it lost its chokehold - and therefore most of its influence - on the industry. This represents a real opportunity for the US to help shape a nascent technology sector. If we handle this poorly (ie: like China), then other nations will take the lead.
Anything that humans want will find a market. If regulations are too harsh, growth will slow and human nature will lead to black markets.
Tumblers, VPN use, privacy coins, moving wealth out of the country, etc.

Taxes: In the end, most of us just want to be good citizens and pay reasonable taxes. PLEASE look to what other countries are doing, and let's copy what works. Why reinvent the wheel?

Some people who have influenced and informed my views:: Anthony Pompliano, Benjamin Cowen, Charles Hoskinson, Tim Draper, the Winklevoss twins, Michael Saylor, Dan Held; there are many others, but these are the first to spring to mind. And there are a lot of clowns out there as well, hustling for attention.

Hope I didn't overwhelm you; the scope of this will do that!

All the best,
My name

gaming,Games Need To Shut The Fuck Up,"I’ve been playing Elden Ring lately and it’s a breath of fresh air in that I can start the game, make a character, and be in the game world in under five minutes with little exposition. I was thinking of my favorite titles like Subnautica and Breath of the Wild and the thing that ties them together with Elden Ring is that they trust the player.

Compare that to a game I’ve invested a lot of time in lately, Pokémon Arceus, which can’t ever shut the fuck up. The characters aren’t even saying anything. I don’t need to wade through miles and miles of text to know to press L2 and lob a ball to catch a Pokémon. I don’t need to see eight pages of text for a fetch quest. Just… ugh, shut the fuck up and let me play. Pokémon is at its best when the game gets out of its own way and let me play. Subnautica leaves you to your own devices within 30 seconds of the intro launching. Is the first hour difficult? Yes. It’s a foreign, alien world at a weird time in the future. And you know what? Overcoming the unknown and mastering the mechanics without being spoon fed is god damn satisfying.

JRPGS fucking kill me because they all suffer from DBZ Disease- six episodes of nothing but repetitive, inane dialogue that advances absolutely zero plot.

vet,My cat has diaherra all the time. Now I am just out of options.,"Hi Reddit, 

I am just out of options and just perhaps was wondering maybe I can get some help here. 

I recently adopted my cat from a friend. My cat has constant soft stool which smells bad - and sometimes diaherra ( even before I adopted her ). I have taken her to the vet twice , and they cannot find anything wrong with her. She is normal and runs around a lot .. nothing seems wrong. but the fact that she keeps having soft stool I wanted to find out what’s wrong. 

It has caused me a fortune going to the vet and I am just now at my wits end. 

1. Did fecal test. She has no worms. I also did frontline anti pests a month ago already. 

2. I have changed the feed to royal canin gastrointestinal. Her poo did improve Slightly , but nowhere to where it is supposed to be hard. 

3. I have added probiotics. Doesn’t really work. 

4. She was on antibiotics for a bit. This isn’t helping. I also fed her pro kolin - not working. 

5. She is tested positive for feline coronavirus. But I don’t know whether this makes a difference as the vet told me this is super common in cats. 

6. I tried to add pumpkin to add fiber , but now she ended up farting and even towards diaherra. 

7. She has some bald spots but the vet said not serious and nth can be done about it.

I am an optimist dreaming of a better future! Ask me anything!","May 27th, 2021, my town was evacuated due to the Spur Fire. It
destroyed 30 structures, and 13 homes. That day changed my life. I
watched the fire threaten everything we knew, and when we fled that day,
we didn’t know if we would be starting over. It shook my very soul. In the
aftermath, the Firefighters used so much water fighting the fire, that we
had water restrictions for days. The power lines and the phone lines also
burned, so we were without power for days, and internet for weeks.  

As I watched the community come together, and take care of each other
during and after the fire, I was utterly inspired. Political differences meant
nothing when peoples homes were burning and their lives destroyed.
From that day forward, I decided I would do everything in my power to
bring that same community spirit to every aspect of my life. I am
determined to solve every problem I face.

I am an inventor with a passion for learning. In response to the fire, my
current project is focused on using chemistry and materials science to
create a cheaper artificial pumice. It’s a durable, lightweight, fireproof
building material and natural insulation. Other projects focus on
desalination and water treatment, carbon capture, and more efficient light
collection for solar energy. I firmly believe that every problem can be
solved by creative minds. Modern problems require modern solutions; by
investing in innovation we can solve problems using modern solutions and
create prosperity for our people for generations to come. America can
choose to lead the world through the next industrial revolution.

I am running for congress as an independent because I do not feel
represented. I seek to build a broad coalition among Americans who feel
the system is not working. I offer All-American ideas that will improve
everyone's lives. My platform's policy positions include cost-effective
structural changes to shift power back to the people, away from
government and business interests. These steps will revitalize our
democracy from the ground up, creating a grassroots trickle-up economy.
I truly believe when people are heard, represented and participating in
democracy, everyone prospers.

EDIT: I am an Independent running against Paul Gosar. Check the new congressional maps. District 9 is now Western Arizona. I am 100% grassroots, people powered, anti-corruption. These are the first things I would do if elected.

Overturn the Citizens United ruling.

Legislate that current lobbying practices are bribery and racketeering.

Ban Congressional and governmental insider trading.

So here’s my thoughts, what are yours?
Please feel free to pick apart my conclusions.

Trains, specifically high speed rail is going to be bi go in the future. In an attempt to lower carbon emissions many countries are going to start banning short haul domestic flights when there is the option to use a train. France is already in this process.
Trains are cheaper, better for the environment and far less hassle then planes.

People eating healthy. Now I’m not expecting everyone to turn into a vegan but people will start focusing on healthy eating a lot more. It’s hard to say what big companies will benefit from this, but a company like McDonalds I will be interested to see how they are doing in twenty years. Yes they will adapt and people like McDonald’s but hey can’t exactly reinvent themselves into a healthy option. Yes they will be around still but there will surely be a significant decline. 

New fuels, this is obvious I won’t go into this.

Electric planes, cars and trains. Once again obvious.

Space, a long way out.

War. There is always going to be war and given today’s climate I see the d fence sector becoming the new tech sector.

Cyber security, with war will come cyber attacks. Cyber security will be a massive player in the future. 

Crypto, personally I don’t particularly like crypto so much. But I can’t see how it doesn’t become massively adopted. If you look at Visa for example, retailers have to pay charges to do Visa transactions. Why would they keep paying those fees when they could just switch to crypto. PayPal will die imo.

Sustainable practices is once again obvious. 

Semi conductors, the demand is just so high.

And my last point I have not spent much time on but that is free games and free software. If you look around these days there is so much great software or games that are free. Look at blender for example, costs nothing and it’s a brilliant tool. At some point people will surely move away from the likes of Adobe etc and just use these free alternatives. Same goes for games, people are fed up paying $60 for a broken unfinished game when you can play a better game for free and decide if you want to put money into it as you enjoy it. Not pay up front and then be disappointed.
Based on this last point, if I’m right, this will have a massive negative effect on many behemoth companies like Microsoft, like Adobe, the list goes on.",finance,1646415059.0

defi,Australia must speed up its crypto reform or risk falling behind,"Unless the Australian government and financial institutions step up the pace, Australia will miss out on a chance to lead the world in cryptocurrencies. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg made a rallying call for the government to be granted greater authority to make digital asset reform a reality in his keynote talk to the APAC Blockchain Conference, a copy of which was acquired by NCA NewsWire. 

Senator Bragg conducted a Senate inquiry that determined the global market value of the digital asset ecosystem to be roughly $2.8 trillion, with around 221 million users. According to a research by professional services firm Ernst and Young, cryptocurrencies and associated digital assets may generate $68.4 billion in revenue and employ 205,700 people in Australia by 2030, which is 17 times the current employment. In December, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg indicated that he will strive to build a regulatory framework to support the rising usage of cryptocurrency. The proposal, however, will not be completed until the end of the year, after the approaching federal election. Finally more bullish news in the market. My strategy is to buy in multiple DeFi projects like $AGFI and other great projects and HODL. The big market cap increase in crypto recently may start a new bull run so I am feeling bullish. What’s your strategy in today’s market?",cryptocurrency,1646430788.0
CryptoCurrency,"Coinbase: Crypto is resilient, but only by end of Q2 further recovery","The conflict in Ukraine due to the Russian invasion has caused a stir in the markets. Nonetheless, the crypto market is holding up nicely, showing ""resilience."" [So writes crypto exchange Coinbase in a report, viewed by CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/04/coinbase-says-crypto-markets-resilient-after-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines).

&amp;#x200B;

**More uncertainty in crypto market**

Despite the market showing nice resilience so far, the situation remains uncertain at best. Coinbase head of institutional research David Duong says the conflict has brought further uncertainty regarding the U.S. central bank's (Fed) approach to rising inflation.

This was already in play before the conflict began and was reason for many investors to ""de-risk. Riskier investments went out the door, which in turn led to liquidations of futures positions. As a result, the crypto market bottomed earlier than expected.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumption is that the conflict will be short-lived**

The fact that prices were already falling significantly before the conflict began, together with the rapid dump after the conflict began, has led to a market that is now showing resilience, according to Coinbase. In doing so, investors would generally assume that the conflict will be short-lived. However, this remains uncertain due to the enormous resistance shown by the Ukrainian military. As a result, the conflict could still last a long time. However, the conflict is causing investors to expect the Fed to be less aggressive in raising interest rates, according to Coinbase. This could be a positive development for crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coinbase for short term less positive**

However, Coinbase, states that this will not immediately mean that prices can recover further. Duong states that the market is in an ""unstable equilibrium"" for the time being. The market therefore needs more time to stabilize. Only towards the end of the second quarter does Coinbase expect a further recovery.",cryptocurrency,1646430804.0

I've read online that you can potentially end up paying just MSRP if you ""order"" the vehicle directly from the manufacturer. Is that true? I understand the downside is waiting 2-3 months, but it may be a viable option if it means saving thousands. The 2022 RAV4 LE they're looking at currently has an MSRP of $29K.

# **Russia’s Ukraine conflict, big inflation report will keep the stock market volatile in coming week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/04/russias-ukraine-conflict-big-inflation-report-will-keep-the-stock-market-volatile-in-coming-week-.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
&gt; Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will continue to be a major focus, as wary investors watch fresh inflation data and the rising price of oil in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Stocks in the past week sold off in volatile trading, as oil rose more than 20% and a whole host of other commodities rose on supply worries. Investors sought safety in bonds, driving prices higher and the 10-year Treasury yield to 1.72% Friday. The dollar rallied, pushing the dollar index up 2% on the week.
*****
&gt; “We just don’t know what can happen over the weekend. It looks like the Russians are amping themselves up and they’re getting more aggressive,” said Jim Caron, Morgan Stanley Investment Management head of macro strategies for global fixed income.
*****
&gt; “If nothing happens over the weekend, or if there’s some peace talks coming, then the 10-year note yield could go up 10 to 15 basis points. It could have that swing,” said Caron. Yields move opposite price. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.)
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve will also be top of mind, as investors focus on its pending interest rate hike on March 16. But Fed officials will not be making public addresses in the quiet period leading up to their meeting.
*****
&gt; The economic calendar is relatively light in the coming week, with the exception of Thursday’s report of February’s consumer price index.
*****
&gt; According to Dow Jones, economists expect headline inflation to rise to 7.8% year-over-year, from 7.5% in January, the highest since 1982. Headline inflation includes food and energy prices.
*****
&gt; “The risk is to the upside. It will be a shocker if we get an 8% handle,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
&gt; Investors will also focus on how the market itself is trading. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.3% to 4,328 in the past week, while the Nasdaq lost 2.8% to 13,313.
*****
&gt; “The major averages are all in a downtrend here. They seem to rally and then run out of steam,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. “Until you get some kind of break of that, you want to be a little cautious. It’s definitely concerning, all this stuff.”
*****
&gt; Hickey said that the market is behaving similarly as it did in other conflicts.
*****
&gt; “In the short run, there’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Hickey “I think the playbook is similar. You tend to see a lot of sloshing around - big swings up and down — and then eventually things start to stabilize a few months later...The question is where does this one go?”
*****
&gt; # Boiling oil
&gt; Following a week of gains, oil jumped sharply again Friday, with West Texas Intermediate rising above $115 for the first time since 2008. WTI rose 7.4% Friday and was up 26% for the week, to settle at $115.68. Russia’s battle for control of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant early Friday spooked investors.
*****
&gt; The Russian invasion of Ukraine has stirred up more fear of inflation, and economists are already raising their inflation forecasts, due to rising oil prices. The whole commodities complex has shifted higher, since Russia is such a key producer of wheat, palladium, aluminum and other commodities.
*****
&gt; Rising oil prices can be a worry since they can generate one of the biggest hits to inflation and do so quickly.
*****
&gt; Russia is unique in that it is a very large commodity exporter and has the ability to impact many markets. It is one of the world’s largest exporters of crude and natural gas, with its primary customer Europe. It is the largest exporter of both palladium and wheat.
*****
&gt; The jump in oil has already been hitting U.S. consumers at the pump. Gasoline prices were $3.83 per gallon of unleaded Friday, up 11 cents in just a day and 26 cents in a week, according to AAA.
*****
&gt; “The national average could get to $4 a gallon next week,” said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital.
*****
&gt; In the oil market, Kilduff said there was brisk buying Friday. “There’s still room to grind higher, as we continue to price in the loss of Russian crude oil,” he said.
*****
&gt; The U.S. and its allies did not sanction Russian energy, but the sanctions did inhibit buyers, banks and shippers who fear running afoul of sanctions on the Russian financial system.
*****
&gt; “It’s pretty clear nobody wanted to be short going into the weekend,” said Kilduff. “There’s still room to grind higher as we continue to price in the loss of Russian crude oil.”
*****
&gt; Oil traders are also watching to see if Iran is able to strike a deal that would allow it sell its oil on the market, in exchange for an end to its nuclear programs. It could then bring 1 million barrels back on to the market, but analysts say there will still be a shortfall.

&gt; # Will Ukraine and Russia Impact The Usually Bullish March?

&gt; Good riddance to February. It was another negative month for stocks, but the clear headline was Russia invading Ukraine and the potential impacts that would have on the global economy and stock market.

&gt; First things first, this means the first two months of 2022 have been in the red for the S&amp;P 500 Index. “Seeing the first two months of a new year in the red isn’t a great feeling, but the good news is lately it hasn’t been a major warning sign,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The first two months of 2016 and 2020 were both negative, but stocks were able to claw back and finish higher those years.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/V.png))**

&gt; It is important to remember that this is a midterm year and early in midterm years, stocks tend to have some trouble. That has played out once again in 2022, but don’t forget later in these years tend to see a very strong rally.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3.2.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))** 

&gt; Another angle on this is looking at how stocks do each quarter, but broken up by the four-year presidential cycle. Again, investors need to know that this quarter and the next two are some of the weakest out of the entire four-year cycle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3.1.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**
 
&gt; Although midterm years tend to see overall weakness until late, be aware that March is one of the best months of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3.1.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**

&gt; Lastly, looking purely at March based on seasonality shows that this is a solid month. In a midterm year, it is the fourth best month and the past 20 years it is fifth best. Since 1950, it is more in the middle at the sixth strongest. Of course, it would have been better, but the 12.5% drop in March 2020 is skewing things.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3.1.22-Blog-Chart-5.png))**

&gt; Clearly headlines will move stocks in the near-term, but we continue to expect the overall economic growth in the U.S. to remain quite strong and likely push stocks back up to our fair value target of 5,000 on the S&amp;P 500 by year-end.

&gt; # Banks (KRE) Swing Wildly

&gt; While Financials are the best performing sector so far in today's session, leading into today it was the worst-performing sector over the past week thanks in large part to a 3.7% decline on Tuesday; the sector's worst single day since June 2020. Looking more specifically at bank stocks, using the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) as a proxy, yesterday saw an even more dramatic decline of 5.47% marking the largest decline since November 2020. That drop also ranks in the bottom 1% of all daily changes on record since the ETF began trading in 2006. The over 3.5% rebound today, meanwhile, ranks in the top 5% of all days on record as yesterday's decline was not quite enough to drop the industry below its 200-DMA; a support level that has now held multiple times in the past year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/030222-KRE.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/030222-KRE-2.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, it is rare for KRE to fall over 5% in a single day. Excluding yesterday, there were 68 other times this happened but only a dozen of those occurred with at least 3 months between the prior instance. In the table below, we show the performance of KRE after each of those periods.

&gt; While it is far from the case today, typically, the next day has often seen KRE fall further after a 5% drop. Instead, today it is seeing the second-best next-day performance of these instances. As for where things go from here though, returns have been weaker than the norm one week and one month following these past occurrences. KRE has then tended to outperform all other periods three, six, and twelve months out.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain 47.1% of Time When January &amp; February Are Both Down

&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 18 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 17 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 3.78% compared to 8.20% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of -3.67% compared to an average gain of 9.48% in all years. All hope for 2022 is not lost as eight of the 17 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while seven enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.

&gt; # Are Corporate Credit Markets Starting to Crack?

&gt; Within the fixed income markets, the corporate credit markets can, at times, act like a canary in the economic coalmine. The return distribution for credit investors is asymmetrical, which means the potential for losses can be magnitudes larger than the potential for gains. So, credit markets tend to react quickly when economic conditions or corporate credit conditions start to deteriorate. And while fixed income markets broadly are down on the year, corporate credit markets (both investment grade and non-investment grade) are among the worst performing markets in the U.S. this year. Should investors take this as a sign that corporate credit markets are showing signs of stress? We don’t think so.

&gt; “U.S. corporate credit markets have underperformed this year but not because of increased credit risks, in our view,” noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. “That we’re seeing broad based negative returns across most fixed income asset classes is largely due to higher Treasury yields and not deteriorating credit fundamentals.”

&gt; A Credit Default Swap Index (CDX) is a benchmark index that tracks a basket of U.S. corporate credit issuers and tends to act like an insurance policy in the case of an issuer’s default. In essence, credit default swaps strip out most of the interest rate risk of an issuer/security and measures just the credit risk. As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, credit default swap indexes have increased this year but remain well within normal ranges.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3.2.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; As inflationary pressures have broadened this year, Treasury yields, across the curve, have increased due to expectations of Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate hikes. That’s been the main driver of broad-based bond losses and we don’t think it should raise concerns about credit fundamentals. Moreover, we’re seeing the costs to insure the higher rated cohorts (the investment grade issuers) increase at a faster pace than the more default prone, non-investment grade cohort, confirming for us that the increase in cost is due to higher Treasury yields and not a deterioration in corporate credit conditions.

&gt; From a fundamental perspective, corporate balance sheets are still in good shape. Leverage ratios have increased recently, but net debt ratios (debt minus cash on the balance sheets) remain within historical norms. Also, due to the record amount of issuance over the last few years, companies were able to refinance debt at very low interest rates and push back when that debt was set to mature. As such, interest expenses have come down and now many corporations don’t need to access the capital markets anytime soon. We do continue to watch how these companies manage capital allocation decisions. Increases in M&amp;A activity, share buybacks, and outsized dividends are all risks to bondholders and things that may lead to deteriorating credit fundamentals.

&gt; # High Levels of Volatility

&gt; It's been a volatile start to 2022 so far. With an average intraday trading range of two percentage points, the S&amp;P 500's average intraday range in the first 41 trading days of the year has been the widest since 2009, and the only other year besides 2009 where the average range was wider was 2008.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/SPX-avg-daily-range-after-41-td-030322-2.png))**

&gt; High levels of intraday volatility tend to coincide with periods of elevated uncertainty among investors and typically occur during periods when the market is lower. When the average daily range of the S&amp;P 500 has been more than 1.5 percentage points during the first 41 trading days of the year, the average YTD performance of the S&amp;P 500 was a decline of 5.7% (median: -4.3%). This significantly trails the average gain of 1.3% (median: 2.0%) of all years since 1983. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500 has had the second-worst start since 1983 trailing just 2009, when the S&amp;P 500 tanked 25.3% in the first 41 trading days.

&gt; Regarding forward returns after these volatile starts, returns vary. Although performance over the following one and three months tended to be better than average and more consistent to the upside, over the following six months and for the rest of the year, performance was more mixed.

&gt; # Job Gains Surprise to the Upside But Fed Will Still Likely Hike by 25 Basis Points Next Meeting

&gt; The U.S. economy added 678,000 jobs in February and this strong report exceeded consensus forecast of 423,000. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent from 4 percent in January, edging closer to pre pandemic levels. In February 2020, the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent.

&gt; The survey period for this report closed before Russia invaded Ukraine so no geopolitical impacts are in these data.

&gt; February jobs gains were broad based but mainly in the services sector as pandemic effects wane. Restaurants alone added 124,000 and the return to schooling pushed education jobs up by 112,000. Professional and business services added 95,000 jobs.

&gt; The participation rate is 62.3 percent, still 1.1 percentage points below February 2020. Participation rates are still lower than before the pandemic as individuals with young children may struggle to find childcare. The composition of the labor force is also changing as some baby boomers are taking early retirements.

&gt; In February, 13 percent worked remotely because of the pandemic, down from 15.4 percent last month. This percentage will likely continue to decline as more offices across the country loosen restrictions.

&gt; Another encouraging sign is the decline in people unable to work because of COVID-19-related business declines, either from closed or lost business. In February, 4.2 million reported inability to work because of business disruptions, down from 6 million last month.

&gt; “The February jobs numbers are encouraging but overall, this does not change expectations for how the FOMC will set interest rates at the next meeting. The big conundrum for policy makers right now is how to relieve inflation fatigue yet still protect the economy from geopolitical stress,” said LPL Financial Chief Economist Jeffrey Roach.

&gt; Wage growth is slowing. February average hourly earnings were unchanged from January and up 5.1 percent from a year ago. Looking ahead, wages may begin to moderate as the labor market loosens. Participation rates should continue to increase to pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, February posted one of the strongest reports in the last 12 months. The reopening process is supporting the services sector and hiring in services industries like leisure and hospitality strongly contributed to the headline gain in employment. This latest release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will not likely change the minds of the FOMC in the upcoming meeting. Chairman Powell already revealed his preference for a 25 basis point hike in rates and this is the most likely action.

personalfinance,Question regarding defaulted student loans and when they are supposed to fall off your credit report,"So like so many other Americans, when I decided to go to college I took out federal loans. I started college in 2010 and had received federal loans from the very beginning. College however went very poorly for me. A mix of parent abandonment, homelessness, no access to food, etc over the next several years really made graduating basically impossible. During that time I also moved and changed schools. By 2014 I had finally been able to at least get an associates degree to have something to my name. I tried in 2015 going to school to get my bachelor's, but was not able to get any federal loans approved and so I had to drop out. Basically meaning the last year I had received any kind of fed loans was 2014. Even after then I faced more homelessness and having to move around from couch to couch, not maintaining an actual address. Needless to say I didn't pay a penny on my loans so they defaulted. I finally got a job in mid 2015 that allowed me to have just enough money to afford a small apartment and not starve, but not much else.

Fast forward to today. I'm married, have a kid, and building a career in spite of never finishing my degree. That being said, I've still never paid a penny on my loans. The odd thing is I've not had my taxes taken, my wage garnished, nothing. I think it's because when my loans originally defaulted I didn't have a home, job, anything, so they basically couldn't find me and never bothered to.

My question comes down to this. From my understanding, federal loans are supposed to fall off your credit report after 7.5 years even if you defaulted on them. However, my credit report still shows every penny of those loans. They do show up as ""Closed"" accounts, but they are still visible. I'm wondering what the process of them supposedly falling off looks like. Reason being is because I'm going to have be getting a newer car soon for my family as we are currently driving a 14 year old car with nearly 200k miles that isn't going to last much longer. These loans have killed most opportunities of building credit for me, so my hope was they would fall off on their own and no longer drag my credit down. My concern though is drawing the feds eyes onto the fact that I still owe them. While I'm in a better spot now financially, if the feds up and decide to start garnishing my wages now over these it would be devastating, so I don't want to draw more attention to myself than absolutely necessary.

Any insight into this and if there is anything I need to manually do now that I'm part the 7.5 year threshold would be super helpful.

gaming,Is Elden Ring worth it?,"I've heard a lot about this game recently, but I'm still on the fence about it and was hoping you fine internet strangers that have actually played the game can clear up a few details for me. As much as I love gaming, $60 is still a big purchase and I'd like to know I'll be getting my money's worth, or if this game's just not what I'm looking for.

First off, is the game *really* ""open world""? I've been hearing conflicting reports across the net. When I hear the term ""open world"", my mind goes to Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Witcher, etc. A large map that has quests scattered across it, and you're free to go in any direction you want. You can join whatever faction, you can complete or ignore whatever mission, including the main storyline, and still get lost in hours of gameplay. An open world. Soulsborne games, while possessing impressive level designs with occasional branching pathways, felt more ""labyrinthine"" to me. Even if the level has a few different paths, there's inevitably only one direction you can go in to drive the game forward. Don't get me wrong, this formula works for FromSoftware's games, I just want to know what I'm signing up for. From what little gameplay I've seen, it reminds me of Shadow of Colossus, where there's a large open area you can traverse, but there's nothing really to do out there. The important stuff happens in smaller areas that you have to push forward to get through. I've heard people compare it to ""Breath of the Wild"", but I never played that one.

Secondly, how's the gameplay? I imagine it's standard Dark Souls mechanics, but I was just curious if anything was tweaked or added.

Thirdly, I'm running on PS4. How does the game handle on ""last-gen"" hardware?

Finally, and this is the big one, how much of a pain is co-op? I was excited at the idea of exploring this world with friends, but if the co-op is a hassle like Dark Souls and Bloodborne, then I don't see the point in playing with friends. I get that multiplayer is not a simple feature to add to a game, and it can ruin the gameplay if the rest of the game is tailored to a single-player experience, but like I said, this game looked like it would be fun to play with friends. Unfortunately, the last time I tried co-op was in Bloodborne. I was forced to burn very valuable, semi-rare Insight to play co-op, added to the fact we all had to be in relatively the same spot in the game (not the worst thing, but it added another step to an already frustrating process). Worst of all, even with a password, we would just get invaded by some level 300 naked jagweed that would near-instantaneously obliterate us before we were playing for even five minutes. Not to mention, as soon as one of us died, that was it for the co-op session, and we had to start from ground zero for all of us to play again. That means more Insight to burn, but we're all going to get smoked again, so what's the point of even trying? I get that these games are meant to be challenging, but for crying out loud, I just want to have a fun time online with friends, not get griefed. I don't have 50 hours every week to sink into this game to keep up with the griefers.

However, from what I've heard in Elden Ring you burn an in-game item for co-op, but it's easier to craft/collect than in previous games. Can anyone confirm this? Does only the host need to burn this item, or do joining players need to burn it too? If a player dies, does the session end? Are you bound to a specific area when you start a co-op game? Does only the host get XP/items/progress from the co-op session? is there a way to set up a private co-op game so you won't get invaded?",technology,1646475750.0

personalfinance,Confused about calculating taxes as a Freelancer,"Let's say a freelancer working from home with no business expenses is earning 40K a year

 if that person used standard deduction, does taxable income become 40000-12950=27050

Self employment Tax: 27050\*0.9325\*0.152 = 3834$

Trading,How are we feeling on gold and silver?,"I had a bearish view on these pre-Ukraine conflict, with the tightening coming, but now I'm torn. 

I think that while the conflict may be relatively short-lived, the effects of the sanctions and the further fuckery of supply chain might not be - and they might light a fuse under what was already a dangerous situation re inflation.

Both gold and silver are threatening to breakout of long term consolidations (by which I mean since the great financial crisis) and I feel this could be the start of another inflation-fueled run like in the 70s

Then again it is possible the Ukraine situation turns out to be a blip, and the Fed tightening becomes the dominant issue again, which would be bad for precious metals. I'm seeing enough activity on the charts to make me think that is not the case and developing a bullish view. But to be honest it does feel a bit like FOMO, and I might be changing thesis at exactly the wrong time.

personalfinance,Refi/cash out - which scenario makes more sense?,"So I’m trying to free up some cash in order to invest it this year. There’s a lot of volatility in speculative assets right now given the state of affairs around the world…but I think this is an environment where opportunities can be found and I want to take advantage of it.
This all begins with a refi cash out on the equity of my primary home. I currently have a 2.875 rate. Rates offered were still relatively low (2-4%) when I started the process and home values where I’m at in NJ have skyrocketed. 
In the first scenario I’m able to access a little over 100k in equity with 3.875 rate over 30yrs (I was only at year 28 with my current mortgage). The catch is I’m at my max DTI ratio w/ one credit card, a car payment, and a rental property mortgage. 
The company I was speaking with called and said they will probably deny me because I’m at max DTI with a student loan they’re checking to make sure has been completely paid off. It would take a little more time and documentation to know for sure.
The second scenario with this company includes the same terms except the amount I’m able to pull from equity and use toward an investment is less. In this instance they offered to pay off my car completely which I got just this October and owe about 17k on at a $334 monthly payment and 6.89% !!!interest rate. I was appalled at that since I have a 750 credit score. Anyway…my one credit card has $2,500 on it that would be paid off as well. Once about 18k is paid I’m left with 83k. 
My partner in real estate endeavor has access to about $100k in this process as well. So about $180k for a project. In NJ that doesn’t go as far as in other states but it is substantial.
So the question is which scenario makes the most financial sense? I think I know the answer to this question but I was hoping to get another set of eyes on it.
**some other details: the rental property is in a residential area but it it’s a ranch style, duplex. I was under the impression it was zoned for a 4 family so I jumped at the opportunity a year ago. Now finding out the paperwork might not be grandfathered in and the town will require a variance to add an upstairs, which can cost a chunk of change and still be denied at the end of the day. Other option is to buy another property using either all cash or mostly cash. But like I said $180k doesn’t go very far on a home purchase.
Should I try for the variance at about 9-10k to possibly lose? The income from the property would be tripletriple once tenants move in and I’d still only be paying tax on one property (taxes are high in jersey). So it’s definitely the better option…but could end up eating into the money available to do the construction work…

That’s it. Any insight or opinions on which seems like the best option?",finance,1646483934.0

stocks,Fidelity representatives are trying to help buy their technical issue is putting me at risk of margin call. Fidelity also removed my post,"Basically I have 375 MSFT held as margin and 145 held as cash in my taxable brokerage margin account. I have called every day since 02/28 and talked half an hour or more with multiple representatives including their margin and stock plan supervisor Scott. 

They would find eligible unpledged MSFT stocks and pledge them on margin. It would increase my margin buying power but next day stocks would get reverted to cash position making it ineligible as margin decreasing my buying power.

stocks,There's a difference between timing the market and looking at fundamentals.,"I think the advice of ""don't time the market"" is actually pretty damn good.  Life is unpredictable, and the market is often irrational.  The notion that you can enter and exit perfectly, IMO, is pretty naive.

That said, I think we've thrown the baby out with the bathwater with this one.  Timing the market would be ""Oh shit, Ukraine crisis, time to get out"".  ""Ok, crisis solved, time to get back in!""  What could possibly go wrong? /s

But then you could actually do the smart thing and look at fundamentals, whether of individual companies or of the indices.  You could say, hey, VOO is only yielding 1.4% in dividends, I'm not sure that's really worth it.  But then you take interest rates into consideration, and then maybe you say, well, that's actually fair, then.  Great!  But what's happening now is that interest rates are going to be going up.  You have to adjust your notion of what's fair.  That's not ""timing the market"".  That's sound fundamental analysis.

The same people who use the phrase ""don't time the market"" to throw valuation out the window (whether of companies or indices) are the same people who would say ""don't time the market"" in real estate from 2000-2006.  Funny that nobody recommends timing the market, but if that baby's going up, suddenly the trend line is more important than fundamentals.

For some indicators, see here: [https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/).  Note that the S&amp;P 500 is fairly valued when looking at interest rates, but those are going to be changing.",finance,1646497922.0
personalfinance,Looking for people smarter than us to help critique our income /spending and help us plan for the long term,"Hi guys,

I’ve seen you give great advice before so I was hoping you can do the same for us! My parents are TERRIBLE with money and it gives me great anxiety.

We are early to mid 30s. I’m 32 &amp; husband is 35. We have one child, who is 6.

We have just set up retirement funds in the past few months. He currently has 3% taken out of his paycheck with 1.5 match. He wants to get it up to 6% by next year then will be 3% match. We just recently switched to a credit union and I was going to open up a 401(k) for myself, I was going to put $50 to $100 a paycheck in that.

He makes 75,000 a year. Paychecks are $2000 every 2 weeks . That is after health insurance, 403B contribution, HSA contribution.. etc. He claims zero on his taxes, I have tried to convince him to not do that, that is just giving the government our money but he refuses to switch it. Likes getting “big refund”.

We have $10,000 in our savings account.

I bring in $600 every two weeks so ..

$5200 total a month. 

Bills 

2 CCs- $100

Mortgage-$992 

Truck- $390 

Phones-$103

Car insurance-$130

Water-$70

Power-$200

Internet- $55

Gym- $45

Hulu/Disney- $20

HOA-$33

Dogs-$60 

So that’s brings us to $3132 left monthly after bills BEFORE gas&amp;food.

Other important notes - We refinanced to a 15 year loan last year, my goal is to pay it off in 12. So we will be in early to mid 40s without a mortgage.

So do you guys have any suggestions? Other than changing our tax filing. Believe me guys I have tried. He had a friend who claimed one and ended up owing the IRS $500 into federal, so I know it is a moot point because he is so scared of owning. 

Should I keep piling as much money as I can into the house? On his truck? Into savings?

personalfinance,Please Help! Haven't Filed Taxes since 2015... Lots of 1099s 🙀,"Since 2015 I haven't filed my taxes and I don't even know where to start in rectifying this. My biggest motivation for this is that I badly want to buy a house, and also just that... I should probably make it right, haha.

Mid 2016 I quit my full time job to focus on freelance work, so between 2016 and 2019, a large amount of my income was 1099 with a W2 thrown in here or there. I've since started working in the film industry and the majority of my income is now W2s again and has been taxed. I'm certain that I owe back taxes and already understand that I will owe penalties and interest for not paying on time. In 2016 alone I probably made around 30k that was 1099 and paid taxes on *none* of it. Half of that year I was a W2 employee so I paid at least SOME taxes on my income that year. My reasoning for not filing or paying, one might ask? I don't have a ""good"" reason, but recently it has been *strongly* suggested that I have ADHD and that would explain A LOT about the last \~37 years of my life-- I only mention this in case someone out there with ADHD has experience getting themselves out of sticky financial situations and can relate. Tax filing has been one of those things that I kept putting off to do ""later"" and now I am not even sure where a lot of my documents are pre-2019. Thankfully, I've located my W2s and 1099s from 2019 on. I also started filing my 2021 taxes today with FreeTaxUSA, made $117K last year... and my federal refund is supposedly only $15?? What the fuck is that about? I really (*really*) don't understand taxes, y'all.

I'm a nearly 37 year old single, never married woman. No kids. I currently rent a house. I have around $30K saved, so I'm prepared to make payments when I have this all figured out.

What do I do? Should I hire someone to help? I know can't be the only one who has been here. I'm ready to fix it. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated! ✌🏻",finance,1646504916.0

personalfinance,1st time homebuyer with 1st kid on the way: high down payment and budget review,"My wife (34) and I (36) are living in a HCOL and looking to buy a house.  I'm interested in feedback as to whether our judgement seems reasonable, or whether we should reconsider.  Combined, we make about $240k/yr gross and currently max out both of our $401ks.  Take-home after taxes is about $10,300.  We have no debts.

We are interested in homes in the range of $620k-$690k. We currently pay $1850/mo in rent, which is well within our means given the take-home pay.  For this reason, we have saved a substantial sum of \~$300k (outside of retirement accounts).  This amount includes our emergency fund.  Personally, I am leaning toward spending most of it on a downpayment+closing costs (say, $250k) in order to bring our monthly PITI in the range of $2800/mo on, for example, a $680k house.

Is a 35%+ down payment a bad financial decision?  Since I have no shortage of general anxiety, the thought of spending more than $1k above our current monthly housing cost makes me uncomfortable.  I do know that we end up saving in the range of $3k-$4k each month presently, and therefore we can expect to be saving between $1.5k-$2.5k each month after purchasing this hypothetical house while still maxing our 401ks (also accounts for $500/mo in home repair expenses).

Here's the curveball: my wife is pregnant.  I don't have a great sense for how to also budget for a child, since this would be our first kid.  I have looked into daycare cost for \~3mo olds, and we can expect to pay about $2k/mo around here.  This brings us to essentially breaking-even on monthly cash flow while we have a newborn in daycare.  We were thinking of reducing our 401k contributions in order to give ourselves a bit more breathing room once daycare starts (perhaps $12,500 personal contributions from each of us per year -- with employer matching this brings our total yearly retirement additions to $37k).

We both plan to continue working after having a kid.  We both have federal jobs (US), and so our job security is ridiculously good.  My wife intends to work this job until retirement (giving her a FERS pension), while I might consider leaving to pursue higher-risk start-up ventures in the future.  Using Vanguard's retirement calculator, we are likely on track to retire at \~62 even if we reduce our 401k contributions as described above (and also assuming social security at half of its current payout level).

The houses we are looking at are ones I don't anticipate we would ""grow out of"".  I would expect to stay in the house for a minimum of 7-9 years, unless I receive very favorable job prospects elsewhere in the US (my wife can work fully-remote, but I am tethered to my worksite).

I feel like we are in a pretty good position, but like I said: I am a worrier by nature and homebuying (with a kid on the way) is a rather terrifying process.  Thus, any and all feedback is welcome: are we crazy to put down 35% when there are more lucrative investment vehicles? Does my budgeting and budget forecasting sound reasonable?  Anything jump out to you as a blind-spot in my analysis?",finance,1646512849.0
personalfinance,Should I put the proceeds of house sale into index fund or put $ down on next home. I need to reduce monthly costs or make/withdraw $ in dividends regularly. (VA loan),"I’m brand new to even the idea of investing.
Also new to selling a home.
I’ve been reading every post on this sub for the last year trying to inform myself.
I read a post a while back where someone was asking how much they’d need to put into an index in order to make $1,000 a month to live on. I wasn’t even aware keeping money in an index could net you any regular money you could withdraw each month without it cutting into that amount you placed in the fund. I don’t need $1000 a month. $500 a month should be enough.
On that post people advised them that $300,000 in an index would mean they could withdraw $1000 in dividends each month. So does that mean if I invest the $150k I make from this house sale I can make $500 a month (and still not technically be touching the $150k).

I’m a veteran so I’m going to be using my my va loan to buy my next home. Thus, I technically don’t need to put any money down at all. Every lender I’ve gotten a pre-approval from has told me putting money down won’t reduce my interest rate at all either. Credit score 795.

Monthly income will be tight for a while due to a job change so I need to figure out how to supplement it by investing or figuring out if that just isn’t feasible and putting a big chunk into a down payment to lower my monthly expenses that way.",finance,1646515483.0
personalfinance,Bought a house and I'm a little bit stressed,"Hi PF!

I just want a quick reality check because I've been a little stressed about this massive purchase lately...

So my husband and I (both 31 y/o) recently purchased a lovely home for 635k with 20% down at 4% interest rate. Not sure if it'll be our forever home, but we love the area, have good jobs and are definitely planning on staying here at least 10-12 years.

Our combined income (not counting bonuses) is 200k/year, which translates into the following net:
- 10,700 if we both only contribute 6% to 401k (with 6% company match)
- 8,700 if we max both out HSA and 401k

Our PITI + utilities is 3,200 a month, and based on previous years, we typically spend another 3,200 a month on living expenses (all included, from groceries to travel).

So this would leave us with 4,300-2,300 leftover to save/ invest each month. We already have 320k for retirement and no debts of any kind (besides the mortgage above).

We would also have a 20k emergency fund after all downpayment and closing costs are paid, which we want to bump to 30k moving forward.

Our idea is to rent out 1 bedroom for 850 (~500 after taxes) the first year or so until we decide to have kids, which would help us save a little bit more.

Oh I'll also be getting my masters next year, so that should help me get a 10% raise.

personalfinance,How Should I Finance my Home Renovation?,"**Background:**

I'm curious to see others opinions about my plan for buying a house (SoCal area) and renovating it. My fiancé (29F) and I (27M) are currently planning to buy a fixer upper given that the turn-key homes in the area are going for ridiculous prices. Our plan is to buy a house that is in significant need of work so that we can get a lower price and essentially re-do the entire house the way we want it. We understand that the renovation will be costly and have been saving aggressively. Going through the different scenarios in my head I am starting to contemplate whether we should pay for the home renovations with our cash savings, or if we should just get a separate home improvement loan after closing for the amount we need and then refinance it all into a new mortgage. The main reason I am contemplating this is because in order to pay for the large renovation costs we will have to liquidate some of our stock market investments. This will obviously incur capital gains taxes and some sort of opportunity cost as our money will no longer be compounding like it would be if we were to leave it invested. Another talking point would be that the interest rate of the refinanced loan would likely be less than that of the rate of return of my money if it were invested in the market long term (S&amp;P 500 index funds &amp; ETFs).

**So my question is:** Even though we may have the cash to pay for the down payment and the renovations in cash, should we just put little money down (5%), get a separate home renovation loan for the work, and then refinance into a single loan after its complete?

**Assumptions:**

* We would qualify for both the mortgage and the home improvement loan
* House price: $750k w/ 5% down
* Renovations: $100k-$150k
* Estimated Payment after ReFi: $4500-$5000

**Financials:**

* Combined Annual Gross Income: $250k + company stock (275k-300k total)
* Combined Take-Home Monthly Income: $13k (can be more if we work overtime)
* Combined Brokerage Accounts: $135k
* Combined Roth IRA Accounts: $32k
* Combined 401k Accounts: $210k
* Combined Cash Savings: $55k
* Debt: $0
* FICO: 782 &amp; 792

**Notes:**

The monthly take-home income is after deductions for tax, health care, and 401k. We both max out our 401k (or come really close to it) and receive employer match of 2% and 5%, and she has a pension plan as well. The house price and renovation amount is just an assumption based off what we are estimating. We are both financially literate people who have good saving habits and emphasize the importance of being moderately frugal so we can retire early.",finance,1646523795.0

personalfinance,Cost of living in the US vs UK,"I'm fortunate to work in a tech job, specifically coding. These types of jobs pay much higher in the US so I'm trying to factor in cost of living differences, currency exchanges, healthcare and other differences to see if I'd be significantly better off. If so I'm seriously considering looking into moving to the US and taking on a coding job there (after locking down a job obviously and sorting visa stuff etc). Probably somewhere like Texas.

To begin with, coding jobs here average around £35k (in pounds). Similar jobs in the US average around $90k+ (in Dollars). Healthcare would obviously be a consideration for my family, though my understanding is that this would likely be coeverd by a decent employer?

I believe rent is higher in the US, however I think this would easily be covered by the jump in pay. I'd also aim for a cheaper city and just commute (or work remotely like I do now).

I know it's hard to come up with a concrete answer given the myriad factors. But given the above, would my pay be significantly better off working in the US?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you so much for the well considered replies guys, especially more specifics about healthcare. We live in the north west of England, more reasonable house prices so nothing crazy like London. Altthough the house prices are start to spike massively even here, especially for renting.

In regards to visa, we wouldn't be pulling the trigger on this for at least 5 years, I need to do a ton of research before even comitting to the idea, having savings for when we first arrive etc. I'll of course apply nice and early and factor in the multiple year wait, but at the moment it's weighing up whether it's an idea I take seriously and getting into specifics, and not just ""oh that'd be cool"".  


Edit 2: Assuming a state like Texas where I understand it's just Federal taxes, after taxes $90k works out around £56k (in pounds), a jump of around 20,000 pounds per year for the same job. Also I did some quick research and found a reasonable cost of living calculator comparing Texas to the UK. Overall, Texas is 14% cheaper to live.

personalfinance,smaller down payment to pay off all extra debt?,"Basically what the title says. We are under contract for a new home. We were approved at the bank with a  20% down payment. The equity in the home we are selling allows for a 40% down payment, as well as paying off one of our vehicles. After closing costs and a potential appraisal gap (seriously, this market is so insane but it is the perfect house for our long term future) we wouldn't have anything left after that. But it occurred to me, that if we do the 20% down, we could pay off all 3 car loans equalling close to about $1100 a month. Plus a couple of other random debts like our cell phones. Otherwise we're pretty much debt free. We would also be able to pay down our interest rate with further points. And our monthly bills would actually go down compared to what they are now. Though the house payment would be about $400 more than we initially wanted to spend. Of course that is also taking into consideration that all three of the vehicles would eventually be paid off in 7 years vs a 30 year mortgage. At the end of the day we would still pocket probably $75,000. As I lay here in the middle of the night stressing over buying a house in this crazy market, this is where I've landed. If we did it this way our monthly bills would actually go down by $1000/ month. Thoughts?",finance,1646567151.0
stocks,Investment Strategy,"Hello all, I was wondering if I could get some feedback on my current investment strategy. 

Disclaimer: I  have my emergency fund fully funded in cash in my savings account.

I am in my early 20s and intend to use my individual Roth IRA to hold more growth oriented companies to maximize tax free capital gains (i.e. Google, Salesforce, Crowdstrike, etc.). I know that market is volatile rn with Russia, inflation and interest rates, but I am okay with the volatility since I'm young and I DCA into those stocks every week.

My individual taxable account I want to use as sort of a counter-balance to my Roth and hold more steady, dividend growth stocks and safety stocks  that perform well in inflation/rate increase period (i.e. financials, regional banks, energy, etc.). Again DCA into this portfolio every week 

Lastly, my job provides a self directed Roth 401k that they match and I intend to use that as a Quadfecta portfolio since QYLD distributions are now being considering income this tax season.

Thoughts? Any way to optimize this for taxes or gains?",finance,1646573765.0
financialindependence,Seven Year Update,"TLDR - [Net worth, income, Asset Allocation, and SWR Charts](https://imgur.com/a/GTceT7d). The SWR chart is new and only includes financial assets (no home, vehicles, or college savings), to answer questions people have had in previous years about why I include them in my net worth. I'm using 3.75% as a SWR.

I've been posting my family's net worth updates annually on this subreddit for many years (see [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/308xtv/on_track_to_re_by_50/), [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4a6oww/one_year_update/), [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5ynkqi/two_year_update/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/838e92/three_year_update/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b44qvp/four_year_update/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fevzeg/five_year_update/), and [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/lz36f7/six_year_update_the_seven_figures_edition/) updates); I find sharing my plans and progress to be helpful for giving myself a heading check, and hope this community finds my inputs to be helpful. The past few years have made March kind of a weird time to do these, as it seems to be apocalypse season, but hey - maybe these posts can help show that progress is possible even in the midst of pandemics and world wars.

**Current ages: 36 and 35**, with two kids who have turned into pretty cool little people.

**Combined pre-tax income**: About $218k (\~5.8% increase). Given inflation is running 7%, this means our income effectively plateaued this year and maybe slightly declined. I'm not losing any sleep over this; we have a much bigger shovel than we need. Extra income is a nice to have, but no longer a primary goal at this stage.

**Assets:**

Cash/emergency fund: \~$50k (37.5% decrease). We replaced our roof in the past year, but have still not pulled the trigger on getting solar panels. We were disappointed that no new incentives for solar have passed at the federal level, but a bigger impediment is that our state is currently in the process of ending net metering, and depending on the details on how that's implemented (at first it looked like it would be a dramatic drop-off, now it could be more gradual), we might still end up adding in a few panels this year or next so we can get grandfathered in. In the meantime, we've moved over extra cash to taxable investments because it's been sitting around losing out to inflation for too long.

Tax advantaged Retirement/HSA accounts: \~$820k (13.8% increase). Ouch. Was doing a lot better until Putin decided to go kick off what appears to be a giant war in Europe that's hammered financial markets lately. We don't have access to a fancy mega-backdoor-howyadoin, but we are maxing out both 401ks, Roth IRAs, and an HSA. So all the growth here is really just new contributions this year.

529 accounts: \~$53k (15.2% increase). Using a combination of 529 investment and prepaid tuition plans, our goal has long been to cover about \~75% of the total in-state public college expenses, but now it looks like we might get closer to 100% just because of good fortune. To be fair, our state's public universities are much more affordable than most.

Taxable investments: \~$44.5k (117% increase). This tiny but mighty category is super important to grow quickly as we approach the late game, as we'll need it to support the first few years of a Roth ladder (although with recent rule changes, we might consider a hybrid 72t/Roth ladder arrangement). At this point, all raises and spare cash get sent here, and this is expected to grow rapidly. Additionally, we set up a [DAF](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/p5ioid/donor_advised_funds_a_lategame_strategy/) and are now routing our charitable contributions though it to peel gains off our taxable investments, thereby limiting our tax exposure in this bucket.

Vehicles: $34k KBB value of three cars (9.6% increase). I...had a hard time updating this number in the spreadsheet. Every instinct in my bones says to never appreciate the value of automobiles. But the auto market is truly bonkers right now. And in fact, I \*discounted\* this value artificially because I refuse to believe that our cars are worth as much as KBB says they are right now. I fully expect this to drop like a stone at some point and am fine with that.

Home: Using Federal Reserve MSA home index, our home value is now \~$725k (20% increase); using Zillow, the estimate is currently $759k (9.8% increase). We use those two estimates to get a range to estimate our home's value rather than try to nail down some exact number that's going to fluctuate all the time anyways. These methods seem to have converged more closely than normal this year.

**Debts:**

Mortgage: $350.5k at 2.875% for 30 years (2.4% decrease). We refinanced a couple years ago, and are gonna hold on to that rate for dear life. Unfortunately, property taxes, insurance, and electricity are all going up dramatically, so we're still not totally immune from increased housing costs over time, but more protected than most people.

No other debt!

**Net Worth Estimate:** **$1.38M** using Federal Reserve Home Index (\~21.1% increase), **\~$1.41M** using Zillow (\~14.6% increase). Still a pretty good chunk of growth - it's just that most of it came from our contributions this year instead of any investment returns.

**Current plans going forward:** We're approaching the late game and are mostly in good shape. All the tax advantaged buckets are on autopilot and projections show they should be sufficient within a few more years - the big area that needs help is the taxable investments bucket to cover any gaps before our Roth ladders and/or 72t strategies can activate. I feel like needing a big lift in that one area provides motivation to keep pushing at this stage. We're looking at roughly 2027-2030 for our goal to step back from full time professional work.

**Not included**: Just figured it's worth pointing out that we didn't include Social Security for either of us, which I'll estimate at about \~$40-50k/year total.  I'll also be eligible for a small defined benefit pension in my 60's for another \~$20k-$25k/year. I consider these as safety factors in case something goes horribly wrong.

personalfinance,Refinance auto loan after a few months?,"I'd like to get some input on my plan to buy a car. I'm totally new to the auto loan world and don't know whether or not this is a dumb idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to buy a used car, which would entail me taking out about a $19k loan at about a 6% interest rate. I have a seasonal summer job at which I can reasonably assume I'll make about $15k over the course of  my time there. I'd hope to make more, but this is a pretty good lower bound. If I don't end up making enough to completely pay off the balance of the loan by the end of the summer, would it make sense to refinance my loan after I've paid off a significant chunk in order to give myself a break and lower my monthly payment? My non-summer job doesn't pay as well as I get during the summer, so I'd like to lower the payments a bit. This seems like it would be a solid move, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something.

personalfinance,Pay off Student Loans vs Upsize,"My wife and I have aggressively saved during the pandemic, and have amassed about $80k in cash. She has about $95k in student loans that are currently in forbearance and will have an 8% interest rate  (ouch) when payments resume. These are government loans on an income-based plan, but we basically haven't had to pay anything on them since we got married because of the pandemic student loan freeze, which has really helped us save. Who knows when payments will resume, but I don't think student debt forgiveness is really on the table.

At the same time, we have a newborn and a dog and have outgrown our 2 BR Boston condo. I'd love to move into a single family house, and watching the Boston single family housing market explode the last two years has been depressing. We'd basically be able to afford our dream-home using the equity in our condo and the cash, but our savings rate would be much lower with a bigger mortgage and daycare.

I think the conservative, rational decision is to pay off the student loans this year, and use our currently very affordable mortgage to restart our savings for a house. The loans definitely cause me anxiety, but at the same time I'm having a hard time coming to terms with throwing all this money toward debt while our friends all move into nicer homes with their growing families.

 A big thank you in advance to anyone who reads this and has some input.

My mother passed away one month ago. I've been bumbling along, trying to do the things in front of me - memorial, funeral, obits, death certificate, etc. - while keeping my job while my heart feels like it is breaking.

Long story short - my mother took an early retirement from the Federal Government about a decade ago. She was a Federal employee throughout her career and received a monthly payment. I had assumed she might have her insurance policy and/or pension/stocks with the government, but OPM said that is not the case and to try Met Life who also said she did not have anything with them.

I did find a $250 monthly payment to New York Life - I filed a ""search for lost policy"" with them, as well as with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

***Is there anything obvious I am missing here?*** She always spoke of a hefty life insurance plan but I stupidly never let the conversation go very far because I would start crying.

First time posting here. I wanted to provide my current personal finance situation and see what “next step” recommendations you all would have for me to take in regards to personal finance. 

I am soon to be 28 years old and I made $110,000 in 2021. I’m in a sales role so it can be volatile but I expect to be able to do $100k+ in 2022. 

I currently contribute 5% to 401k and 1% to Roth 401k with a 1% employer match. The balance for those account is $18,500. 

I own a home that has appreciated from $300k to $420k in less than 2 years of ownership. The note on that is at $272,500 at 2.99%. I have PMI but I will be able to get that removed with an appraisal after I have owned the home for 2 years. I’ll be doing that in 3-4 months. 

I have a student loan balance at $4,500 which I am most likely going to be paying off in a month before student loan payments start having interest again. 

I have a car note with $9,000 left on it at 6.9% interest. Really bad interest rate. I am considering paying this off right now as well. 

I have $89,000 in the bank. Should I pay off my student loan and my car? Should I open another savings account like an IRA or a Roth IRA?

personalfinance,Bond fund help please,"In 2017, I put quite a big chunk of my husband's IRA accounts in a bond fund. I will be the first to admit I am not as educated about bonds as I should be. I chose a bond fund because I thought it would be a source of income. And it has been (although the monthly dividend amount did go down 18 months ago). Recently, the value of the fund shares have been plummeting and it's freaking me out. I do understand that when interest rates rise (as they're anticipated to do any minute now), bonds paying lower rates of interest will decease in value. However, I thought that by investing in a bond fund, rather than individual bonds, I could circumvent this problem. I feel so naive as I type this.

personalfinance,Are Target Date Fund expense ratios really that bad?,"When I started reading PF a few years ago the general advice I kept seeing was to invest your money into a TDF as a simple, set it and forget it method. So I opened a Roth IRA and consolidated a couple old 401ks into an IRA on Vanguard and put them each into TDFs, traditional in 2050 and roth into 2055. I had just started with a new company and put my 401k also into a 2050 TDF. 

Recently though it seems any time I read any advice it's that TDFs have high fees and you're throwing away money not being in a 3 fund portfolio. I spent this morning going through all the options in my 401k to see the expense ratios and the TDF I use has an expense ratio of 0.17%. Obviously not as great as the 0.08% on my IRA TDFs, so I looked at the funds available on my 401k and they had the following:


Name | Ticker | Expense 
:--|:--|:--

stocks,Oil surges above $130 Sunday evening (+$15/bbl vs Friday); Stocks Face Oil Risks Amid Talk of Russia Embargo,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks face a challenging open Monday after the U.S. raised the prospect of working with allies to ban imports of Russian oil, a step that could stoke the rally in crude and intensify inflationary pressures.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday the U.S. and its allies are looking at a coordinated embargo following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while ensuring appropriate global supply. Equity futures earlier were already pointing to declines in Japan and Hong Kong and a muted start in Australia. 

The dollar was mixed against key peers in early trading. Demand for havens has taken a greenback gauge to the highest since 2020 and spurred a rally in sovereign bonds. Yields retreated in Australia and New Zealand.

The Swiss franc, another bolthole in times of stress, slipped after a governing board member of the Swiss National Bank said it’s ready to intervene to tackle rapid strengthening. 

Oil has topped $115 a barrel, climbing along with grains and metals on concerns of supply disruptions due to Russia’s military action, ensuing sanctions and a reluctance to trade with a resource-rich nation that’s becoming a global pariah. Traders are also assessing a drop in Libyan output.

An index of commodities jumped the most last week on record, raising the specter of escalating price pressures. The global economy was already struggling with high inflation due to pandemic-era snarls. 

The Federal Reserve and other key central banks face the tricky task of tightening monetary policy to contain the cost of living without upending economic expansion or roiling risky assets.

“For the U.S. economy, we now see stagflation, with persistently higher inflation and less economic growth than expected before the war,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note. “For stock investors, we think 2022 will continue to be one of this bull market’s toughest years.”

Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Friday the central bank should increase interest rates to close to its “neutral” setting this year, implying as many as seven quarter-point hikes.

“Central banks are facing an exogenous stagflationary shock they cannot do much about,” Silvia Dall’Angelo, senior economist at Federated Hermes, wrote in a note.

In Russia, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree allowing the government and companies to pay foreign creditors in rubles, seeking to stave off defaults while capital controls remain in place. Sanctions will determine if international investors are able to collect payments, the Finance Ministry said.

China signaled more stimulus is on the cards by setting an economic growth target above forecasts. Premier Li Keqiang vowed at the opening of the National People’s Congress, the Communist Party-controlled parliament, to take bold steps to protect the economy as risks mount.

dogecoin,Before skipping the HODL..,"I think it’s important to remember that the ebbs and flows of the market are in tangent with the major cryptocurrencies. Sure there are outlying price increases and drops in crypto (as with anything) but we should set our eyes on the bigger picture here.

Oil is up to around 130 a barrel, the costs of living is higher, interest rates on mortgages are going up soon. All of these things relatively decrease demand for companies items as people are strung out on cash during these tough times. This results in the decrease in sales for companies and a slowing economy. These changes may result in a bear market as well for the same exact reasons. 

We need to remember that doge isn’t going down because it’s doge. It’s going down, again, in tangent with the market. I believe in the past year the drop in the price of doge has slowed from previous levels. 

We also see the value in doge as it’s being more commonly accepted as payment by a growing amount of companies. This is good for Doge as it shows that there is value that is recognized. 

TLDR: doge is down because everything is down. Hold because that is the nature of the market and not the asset itself. Don’t be steadfast on selling or losing hope. This is the exact thing that would bring doge to a crash.

personalfinance,Have about $35k in bank. Suggestions?,"First off some background. I have graduated college about 2 years ago. I have roughly $45k of federal loans that are on pause currently until May (who knows what will happen regarding that lol). My plan regarding the loans at least for the short term is to do an income repayment plan, just due to the uncertainty surrounding it.

My company does 5% matching for 401k, which I currently do. I also have an HSA which I max out and any money excess of $3k is transfered to an account that invests into the S&amp;P 500 index fund. I plan on increasing my 401k to 10% soon.

Now to the main point. I currently have $35k sitting in my bank account. Originally I was just letting it sit there due to plans of paying off large amounts of my loans when the interest started again. However given the whole situation surrounding that I'm less likely to do that (if you still think I should go that route then please do share).

I'll keep roughly $8k in the bank for emergency funds. However that still leaves $27k. My initial idea is to invest it into a total stock market fund like the VTSAX.

He never looks in any of the legit Crypto related subreddits or news, but rather depend on Instagram influencers and sketchy telegram channels. Heck he didn’t even knew that GPU prices are tied to crypto since they are used for mining. 

He asks me for advice before buying coins, I look up for the facts online and almost predicts outcome of the current market. All the time I have advised him to not buy the coin, he buys it anyway and loses shit ton of money. The thing is, he has no steady job, he gets the money from his parents or takes loan. Now he has lots of loan and he is asking his friends including me for more money. Im happy to give him money, but not for throwing it away on crypto. Last time I denied and he asked his girlfriend to give him about 0.5ETH worth of money, I asked him not to do that and don’t buy crypto because it was around the Ukraine/Russia conflict escalation. But anyway he did buy VET for all the money and then the war started and he now lost half of his money again.

I’m fed up advising him not to invest on crypto because he is honestly dumb and doesn’t try to understand how the market can crash before doing anything. But as his friend I don’t want him to spend all his money and his parents savings on this in hope to hit the jackpot. 

Im looking for advice on how to make him stop investing in crypto, at least till he is living on his own feet. 

ps: I live in a developing country, $8000 is a really really big amount here.

personalfinance,Personal loan to pay off debt?,"Would it be reasonable to get a personal loan in order to pay off my credit card debt? Does it affect my credit? I currently have 4 cards that are under varying degrees of usage, and one with 0 balance. I did the stupid between 18 and 22, using my credit cards more freely than I should have, and now I've racked up the debt. But I've never missed a payment on anything before, which helps my credit be in the ""fair"" range. I would be fine using my car as collateral, given I do no plan on missing payments, and likely would try to pay close to the same as what I am now. 

Part of the reason I'm looking into it is because I would like to have just one payment to worry about, plus if I can get a lower interest rate than most/all of my cards (lowest is about 18%), then I could potentially pay less in the end, though I'm not sure of the math on that. I'm 25, and I'm stable where I am, as long as I don't have any surprise/major expenses. I looked at a loan calculator online and for a 3 year loan with 10% interest, payments would be about the same as what I'm paying right now.

Is getting a loan to pay off my credit card debt a viable, reasonable option? Or should I just suck it up and keep going as I am, paying each card individually and working them down?

defi,Switzerland May Target Crypto Assets Belonging to Sanctioned Russians,"Neutral Switzerland may target crypto assets within its territory that belong to sanctioned Russian entities. 

The move is designed to protect the integrity of the country’s cryptocurrency industry. The crypto-assets that are not stored with cryptocurrency exchanges are impossible to target.

It is believed that the country may “target” all crypto asset service points within its borders that are owned by Russians and all entities that have been sanctioned by the European Union. To achieve this, the non-EU country’s Federal Council said it will add provisions against cryptocurrencies to own its sanctions regulations.

According to an unnamed official from the country’s finance ministry, denying Russian digital currency holders access to their crypto assets also helps to protect the integrity of Switzerland’s cryptocurrency industry.

Switzerland, whose financial institutions are accused of hiding assets of Russian oligarchs, has already adopted the EU’s punitive sanctions against Russia. 

However, despite the imposition of sanctions, some politicians and officials from the U.S and Europe have expressed their concerns over the potential use of crypto assets by sanctioned Russians to evade sanctions. 

Also before the Russian military’s incursion into Ukraine, opponents of crypto assets had regularly argued that the digital assets are being used by criminals and to launder money.

personalfinance,How to get out of debt cycle with low credit score?,"Hello folks!

I am in a desperate need of financial advice from those who went through the same or those who have good financial knowledge and insights on how this whole system works. 

Last year during the pandemic I got overly ambitious about leaving my office job and “be my own boss”. I took out a few high interest loans to start my own business. I won’t go into details but long story short - some dreams are meant to stay dreams. Now I have a few VERY HIGH interest loans to pay off. My whole paycheck goes into paying them off, plus regular things such as rent and bills, leaving me with nothing to save up, live on or use to pay off my credit cards. 

My friend suggested me to take a line of credit from my bank to pay off high interest loans first. Then focus on paying off my credit cards and that same line of credit. However, since my credit cards are maxed out my credit score is obviously bad, which means my bank is refusing to approve me for line of credit. But if I focus on paying off the credit cards for better credit score, I’d have no money to pay off high interest loans. 

So I am stuck in this weird loop and I don’t know how to get out of it. Ultimately I have no one but myself to blame for my too ambitious dreams and poor research. I am really trying to fix this but seems like my bank is not eager to help. 

I would greatly appreciate any advices or suggestions on what I can do to get out of this weird “I owe” circle if anyone experienced the same. 

A few things to mention:
* I can’t borrow money from friends. 
* I am not on speaking terms with my family so I can’t ask them for help either.
* I don’t have any assets such as a car or a house to sell. I live in a rental studio apartment with my cat and use public transport. 

For the context I live in Canada. Not sure how similar Canada’s banking system is to other NA countries but thought it was important to share.

stocks,Investors should sell any stock market rally - says Morgan Stanley,"Any rally in the stock market should be taken an as opportunity to sell as investors are facing a convergence of risk factors that will pose outsized risks to the market, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note on Monday.

The Federal Reserve is unlikely to deviate from its path of raising interest rates this year, even as pressure on the economy mounts, analysts led by Mike Wilson wrote. The biggest risks will be seen over the next six to eight weeks, they said. 

""We are firmly in the grasp of a bear market that is incomplete in both time and price.""

The bank pointed to the increase of risks to growth, spiking oil prices, and headwinds from the war in Ukraine paired with the Fed's commitment to tighter policy as reasons the bear market could deepen futher.

Bitcoin,"BIDEN TO SIGN BITCOIN, CRYPTO EXECUTIVE ORDER THIS WEEK","President Joe Biden will sign an executive order this week to task federal agencies with assessing the risks and opportunities that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bring to the U.S. and outline the government’s strategy for the market’s regulation, reported [*Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/biden-to-sign-crypto-order-as-industry-faces-sanctions-pressure?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2).

The order will direct federal agencies to examine potential regulatory changes and the national security and economic impact of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, people familiar with the administration’s plans told *Bloomberg*.  


“The executive order, which has been in the works since last year, will require federal agencies across the government to report later this year what they’re doing regarding digital tokens,” per the report. “The plan is expected to begin carving out roles for agencies across the government, from the State Department to the Commerce Department.”

Regulatory efforts [would also involve](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-administration-to-regulate-bitcoin-as-a-matter-of-national-security-report) the Treasury Department, National Economic Council, Council of Economic Advisers, and the White House National Security Council.

personalfinance,Considering Apple Card,"Hi all!

I’m a 21 year old who is halfway through their first semester at a good US university. I like to think I’ve been diligent with my personal finance research, and I’m thinking about taking another step forward. 

A brief background on my situation - currently have no student loan debt. I shouldn’t have any upon graduating in fall ‘22. I have one card that I got on my 18th birthday, and i’ve been in good standing. Always payed in full on time, 2000 limit. Nothing exciting about that card, but it’s gotten me to 742 according to me CU.

I’ve been maxing my ROTH IRA since I was 18, and just funded my 2022 contributions.

I think adding another line of credit is a good idea. I like the apple card because it’s dead simple. Sure, other cards have higher reward offerings or lower interest rates, but this is simple. I’ve never paid interest, so I’m not worried about that. I also like the 0% foreign transaction fees for if/when i travel abroad.

Bitcoin,How will the energy prices affect bitcoins price?,"Energy prices are surging and many analysts are speculating prices of gas and crude oil will continue to rise. This will inevitably affect the economy, especially if prices don't drop rather quickly, which doesn't appear likely at the moment. 

This will lead to an increase in Inflation, likely interest rates will rise in response. This will inevitably lead to a lowering of the amount of capital on the markets and ultimately a recession becomes very likely. At the same time this inflation devaluates traditional currencies value, which might move people to speculate in Bitcoin and other assets.  

Also maybe the rising costs for energy will mean rising costs for mining bitcoins, which might affect the  supply at some point when mining becomes less worthwhile.

personalfinance,27 and 28 year old looking for general advice.,"Hi everyone. I've followed this sub for a long time and have spent hours and on the wiki links in the community info. I just want to make sure my wife and aren't missing anything.  Combined income for 2021 is around 120k. Combined income for 2022 is expected to be 300k possibly more depending on bonuses. 

Background: 

After many years of struggling financially through school my wife and I are finally out and making what feels like a monumental amount of money (wife and I are not from wealthy families). We finished school in the last couple years, got married in 2021, bought a house in 2021, and are ready to start building a foundation. 

We are from the Midwest but moved to Phoenix AZ for work. 

Assets: 

Wife has a 401k with 3% company match. She contributes up to the company match. 

House: purchased in July of 2021 for 369k. estimated value 430k mortgage value 345k. In the process of having it appraised to hopefully remove PMI. 

50k cash in a savings account for emergency.

6k cash in our active accounts. 

One 2010 Ford car fully paid off with 145k miles and an identical car with 80k miles that is also paid off. I fully expect these cars to last 3 more years with minimal upkeep. When we need to take a trip we will take the lower milage car otherwise they are just commuter cars. 

Debts:

Mortgage 345k at 2.9% which I don't intend to make additional payments on other than a couple hundred toward principal a month. 

Student loans: I have 86k in student loans and she has roughly 120k in student loans. Average rate between all the loans is probably 6% 

Expenses:
Our current monthly expenses are around 4k. We pay 2k of that toward our 1800 mortgage. If we eliminate PMI our mortgage payment will be around 1500. 

I expect minimum student loan payments of around 2k per month as well. 


Plan: 

Investments:

Before April 15, 2022, I would like to contribute to Roth IRAs for both of us. I don't know if this process is easy or if I should go to a brokerage. I was thinking of just creating an account with fidelity. After the 12 in Roth IRAs for 2021, I don't think we qualify for Roth IRAs anymore and don't exactly know where we should go from there for 2022. 

Debts: 

Student loans start back up on May of 2022. I'm really waiting to see if they actually go active again or whether they get a rate cap or anything like that. I know there is a big push to forgive loans, but I don't think it will actually happen. I do think there is a possibility that the interest rate could be capped or something like that. If they go active again with no change we will likely refinance the loans with private company at a lower rate. My ultimate concern is if the government does do something like forgive loans, I want to make sure I still have the federal loans to forgive rather than private loans. 

If loans pick back up, then we start taking our discretionary income and paying off the highest interest rate debts between us. I expect that we will be able to pay ~5k per month on debts in addition to the minimum payments required. 

Home remodel: 

Our house needs the backyard remodeled. We want to save some money through this summer and possibly have it remodeled on the fall or potentially next spring before next pool season. Our pool is functional but needs resurfaced. We expect a new pool deck, pool surface, and some additional remodeling to be in the ballpark of 45k. If we remodel the back yard we will likely stay in this house for several years otherwise we may decide to move to a different house in a couple years that already had a nice backyard. 

Ultimate questions: 

What would you do differently? How would you build on our plan? What investing should we be doing after we max out the 2021 Roth IRA contributions? Regular IRAs? I'm planning long term gains so I am also happy with parking money in an index fund or something like that.

Rent has gone up 30% in the last year and seems like everything else is increasing in prices as well.

Forex,Can $DXY hit 100 this week?,"The US Dollar Index (DXY) broke 99 for the first time in nearly 2 years as reports of a potential embargo on Russian oil accelerated risk-off trading. 

$DXY has trended upwards for around 20-months, rallying another 4% after bouncing off trendline support in February. Safe-haven flows created by the continuous geopolitical tensions have been the cause for the USD’s recent rise, despite traders repricing for a less hawkish Fed. However, the central bank remains under pressure to curb record high-inflation, and a strong CPI print on Thursday may reignite speculation for a more aggressive Fed. This would likely support the greenback further, and when mixed with the risk-off sentiment in the market, $DXY could look to break the key psychological resistance at 100 before the end of the week. 

However, it’s also important to note the downside risks that could weigh on $DXY, at least in the short-term, with the daily RSI flashing an overbought signal at the current levels. Given the tremendous pressure the Euro and risk-assets have come under recently, any positive developments out of Ukraine could cause a significant outflow from safe-havens into these assets. Not to mention, a softer-than-expected CPI also has the potential to dampen bullish sentiment for the USD, essentially confirming a tamer start to the rate hike cycle by the Fed.

---

## General, but relevant stats, about myself

* Single (but partnered) 
* 36 year old
* Works from home and domiciled in Oregon State. Can freely move to any other State and establish domicile.
* Salary is $170,000/year and at mininum is raised annually based on the previous year's BLS CPI-U average.
* Annual bonuses range from \$50,000 to \$60,000. Every year for the last decade a bonus has been distributed. Even if the distribution track record has been good, I am going to not consider its existence for this discussion.

## The concern

The concern is that I am going to be adding a signficantly large amount of debt under my name. I believe I can handle the debt, but up until this point I have been relatively debt free, 0% to 2% of net worth throughout my life. Adopting a large debt is new territory for me.

I adopted the financial goal of working towards achieving financial independence (FI) half a decade ago. I am projected (at a 3% withdraw rate) be able to cover my necessary expenses for FI in 3 to 5 years. Add in additional 3 to 5 for a very comfortable FI nest egg.

Taking on this debt would set back my FI timeline, though I never had a strong desire to go the retirement early (RE) route. To me it has been mainly a check mark I wanted to get done ASAP to achieve financial security.

## House in question

I will be putting a offer of \$735,000 and 20% down (\$150,000) on a 30 year conventional. I am going to approach my analysis with a conservative 4% loan interest rate.

The house was built in the last decade. It has high energy efficient features and construction, radiant heating throughout, solar panels, tankless water heater...

The housing market in the area I am considering has grown 5-10% year over year for a while now.

### Additional cash

I also have another \$100,000 earmarked for a house purchase. I plan to use it to cover the numerous costs to get the contract to closing.

Whatever is left, I plan to do a mixture of using it to help subsidize my mortgage payments (versus completely relying on my income), emergency repairs fund, and making it work in the market.

### Crunching the numbers

#### Amortization table

[Link to table](https://www.calculator.net/amortization-calculator.html?cloanamount=588000&amp;cloanterm=30&amp;cinterestrate=4&amp;printit=0&amp;x=87&amp;y=13)

Mortgage payments come out to be \$2,800/month. Starting out, 1/3 of the payments are going towards principal, while the rest goes to interest.

The interest payments add up to around \$20,000 for each of the first ten years, which means itemizing the interest payments is more worthwhile than taking the standard deduction. I'll be able to deduct the full interest amount since the loan is well below the \$750,000 cut off for mortgage interest deductions.

My 2020 effective federal tax rate was 21%. Given the 2022 Standard Deduction of \$12,950, I am estimating \$1,400 a year back into my pocket.

#### Property taxes

According to the county website, for 2022, taxes are \$5,500/year for the property. In other words, \$460/month.

#### Utility costs

The electric and gas bills have ranged in a total of \$30 to \$50 a month.

Water bill came out on average for the two individuals occupying the house on average \$100/month.

I have these numbers since the seller was kind enough to present the monthly statements from the last year.

#### Insurance costs

I am estimating home insurance will be in the ballpark of \$150/month.

#### Summing it all together...

The estimated payments I would have to make for this house and its utilities would amount to about \$3600/month.

## Current situation

### State taxes

I have resided in Portland, Oregon for the last decade. Oregon has no sales tax, but has a high income tax. In Portland, the income tax is even higher than the rest of the State:

* 9.9% income tax with a paltry standard deduction of ~\$2500.
* Any income above \$125,000 is taxed an additional 1% for the metro houseless tax.
* Any income above \$125,000 is taxed an additional 1.5% for the county's Preschool for All tax. Above \$200,000 it is another 1.5%. In 2026, this two rates will be increased an additional 0.6%.

### Accomodation fees

I am currently paying rent at \$600/month.

I am also paying \$300/month on a storage unit. The reason I have a storage unit is that prior to my current living situation I lived on my own for quite a while. Over time I acquired many nice furnishings and various equipment. I had to put these into storage when I merged households with my partner since there is no space for them. And that was after I downsized a lot of it.

Utilities are split 50/50. Numbers are my half, on average.

* Electricity: $45/month
* Water/sewer: $60/month

#### Context

I know I will definitely receive questions about the rent I am paying for the market I am currently living in.

I am fortunate enough to be living with my partner who owns (but still currently paying off their mortgage) house. I let them determine what they would be comfortable in terms of rent. They came up with the \$600/month. Yes, I understand this is extremely low. We had a conversation about this, where I even offered way more than what they wanted. But thjey wouldn't have it and said this is what they wants. I make it up to them in other ways, financial-wise.

## Home ownership situation

### State taxes

The house I am looking for is located in Washington State, by the Puget Sound. I will say it is not located in King County, so I'll be avoiding a lot of the extra taxation like car tabs. Washington has a base sales tax of 6.5%, but in many of the populated cities the county and city sale taxes gets can get this rate up to ~10%. On the plus side Washington is a no income tax State.

Based on last year's tax return, I paid ~\$22,000 in income taxes to the state of Oregon. Setting up domicile in Washington would claw back the income taxes, allowing \$1,850/month to be directed to the home mortgage.

I am considering this area to have a place closer to family.

### Accomodation fees

Using the numbers from the earlier sections, I am estimating the house mortgage with utilities will run me \$3600/month.

Eliminating the rent and storage unit I am currently paying, in addition to the income tax I have clawed back, would allow me to put \$2,650 towards the home without adversely affecting how I have been budgeting my income and expenses.

I would need to rearrange my budgets to close the \$950/month gap. I also have the \$100,000 (less closing fees) earmarked for the house to be used to help subsidize the mortgage payments.

One thing which will be explain in the caveats section is that I am still on the hook for the \$105/month for the Portland residence utilities .

## Caveats

* Living in Washington means my expenses have potentially increased 10% (with exception of food). I don't buy much items these days and I don't think my spending would ever exceed the amount of money saved from not having to to be liable for State income taxes. But also....
* My partner and I are in agreement we will split time at both of our residences. So there is the extra cost of commute to factor it. However, we have been doing this particular commute once a month anyway, so I don't believe the increase in cost will be substantial.
* On the plus side, many of the purchases I need to make can be done Oregon side.
* My partner and I are in agreement we both cover our own mortgages, but we split utilities for both places. Therefore, I am still on the hook for my half of the utilities at the Portland residence. I absolutely have no problems with this.

## Current finances

I am very diligent with my budgetting. I follow a zero-based budgeting strategy and literally track every dollar. To simplify the numbers for the sake of easy discussion...

* \$14,150/month earnings
* -\$1,700/month towards 401(k)
* -$$$ after Federal and State taxes

=&gt; \$8,000 net pay.

After subtracting the monthly bills (rent, utilities, food, insurances and subscriptions, etc) I have \$5,000 left to freely budget. The monthly bills includes the only current debt I have, which is $620/month. This debt will be paid off at the end of 2024.

I usually put \$4,000/month for retirement (brokerage, back door Roth IRA, etc).

The rest I just spend freely.

When I receive the bonus, I usually treat myself to 5-10% of it and then squirrel it all away into retirement.

For retirement, I am currently sitting at \$725,000 (the \$150k downpayment and \$100k earmarked for housing is not included in this number). Back in December 2022, this number was at \$775,000 before the market started to drop. 4% of the cost basis I put towards retirement has been in speculative investing (cryptocurrency and stocks). The 96% has been in a boring two fund portfolio (70% Total US Market and 30% Total International Market). I keep the 70/30 balanced.

## What would I need to adjust in the event of acquiring the house

The obvious adjustment to me would be to reduce what I set aside for retirement to help close the \$950 gap.

So I'll be reducing \$4,000/month towards retirement to \$3,000/month.

I haven't accounted for the money I will be receiving back from mortgage interest. Let's just say it'll help cover for the annual home insurance, which will help reduce the monthly fee by $150.

Edit: I forgot to account for this, but putting aside money for maintenance. The plan is to put away 1% of house cost in monthly chunks. So that means putting away $600/month for upkeep. This will probably be sourced by reducing the funds I had going to retirement.

## My questions

3. Money printing helping to cause inflation and the subsequent attempt at monetary policy tightening in attempts to combat the above issues.

investing,How to determine price/value of Ultra Short Term bond ETFs?,"I've been looking at Ultra Short term bond ETFs such as JPST and have a hard time understanding what determines their value/price. 

After the initial pandemic response and price drop of these ETFs, they recovered and started to produce returns around 0%. The dividend payout of the ETF was equal to the price drop after the payout. I was told this was due to low interest rates, which makes sense. 

In the past 6 months we have experienced high inflation and rate hikes seem certain, however the value of JPST has fallen further and the [returns are negative](http://quotes.morningstar.com/chart/fund/chart.action?t=JPST). Is this because interests rates are expected to rise, but current bonds are using the existing rates which makes them less valuable? Or is it related to tapering of FED purchases? Would the value of shares rise once higher interest bonds are added to the portfolio?",finance,1646715623.0
retirement,Are you bailing out of Bond ETFs and Mutual Funds and going to CD s and Bank Savings Accounts?,"2022 has been a terrible year for the stock and bond market.

In 2021 and 2022 Bond ETFs and Mutual Funds just keep dropping and it seems like a poor time to stay patient.  The interest rates on CDs and Savings Accounts are going up and it seems like the time to sell and move to cash equilvents.

personalfinance,Estimated Tax Payments,"I received an inheritance 2.5 years ago. It was stock valued at approximately 850K, all in one company. When it was transferred to me I set up a TD Wealth Management account, had the stock sold (since owning that much in just one company is not a good plan); half in 2019 &amp; half in 2020, and diversified. The first tax year (2019) I paid capital gains tax on the sale, second year made estimated tax payments based on stock sold in 2020. For 2021 my tax preparer said I didn’t have to make estimated payments. Big mistake. Now I owe $10,000 between fed &amp; state plus penalties for capital gains (penalty amounts to about $125 so not a big deal) but all the gains I made in 2020 and then some have been wiped out since January, so have around $60K+ in loss so far (really feel TD is not serving me well). I need to make estimated tax payments for 2022 but don’t know what my capital gains if any will be for 2022. How do I figure that out? Should I just base off 2021 &amp; hope I’ll get a good refund if I overpay. Obviously I don’t have a ton of cash to use so don’t want to greatly overestimate. Thanks!

CryptoCurrency,I love to read old articles about crypto; it really puts things into perspective.,"I found this old Wired article from 2011 called ""The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin."" FUD and despair about the future of crypto have always been written about, yet crypto keeps enduring. It's a testament to its power and strength. I have to share some gems from the article:

• The small band of early bitcoiners all shared the communitarian spirit of an open-source software project. Gavin Andresen, a coder in New England, bought 10,000 bitcoins for $50 and created a site called the Bitcoin Faucet, where he gave them away for the hell of it.

• A farmer in Massachusetts named David Forster began accepting bitcoins as payment for alpaca socks.

• Through 2009 and early 2010, bitcoins had no value at all, and for the first six months after they started trading in April 2010, the value of one bitcoin stayed below 14 cents. 

• By early November, it surged to 36 cents before settling down to around 29 cents. In February 2011, it rose again and was mentioned on Slashdot for achieving ""dollar parity""; it hit $1.06 before settling in at roughly 87 cents.

• On his Internet talk show, journo-entrepreneur Jason Calacanis called it ""a fundamental shift"" and ""one of the most interesting things I've seen in 20 years in the technology business.""

• Rick Falkvinge, founder of the Swedish Pirate Party (whose central policy plank includes the abolition of the patent system), announced that he was putting his life savings into bitcoins.

• Mark Suppes, an inventor building a fusion reactor in a Brooklyn loft from eBay-sourced parts, got an old ATM and began retrofitting it to dispense cash for bitcoins.

• A young bitcoiner, The Real Plato, brought *On the Road* into the new millennium by video-blogging a cross-country car trip during which he spent only bitcoins. 

• US senator Charles Schumer held a press conference, appealing to the DEA and Justice Department to shut down Silk Road, which he called ""the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen"" and describing bitcoin as ""an online form of money-laundering.""

• Key moments in the short and volatile life of bitcoin.

https://preview.redd.it/8z24ac8km5m81.jpg?width=660&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77fd602fa21e375769774fcc5e65c16929975214

• Some users protected their bitcoins by creating multiple backups, encrypting and storing them on thumb drives, on forensically scrubbed virgin computers without Internet connections, in the cloud, and on printouts stored in safe-deposit boxes.

• Stefan Thomas had three copies of his wallet yet inadvertently managed to erase two of them and lose his password for the third. In a stroke, he lost about 7,000 bitcoins, at the time worth about $140,000. ""I spent a week trying to recover it,"" he says. ""It was pretty painful.""

•  a hacker pulled off an ingenious attack on a Tokyo-based exchange site called Mt. Gox, which handled 90 percent of all bitcoin exchange transactions.

• In the public's imagination, overnight the bitcoin went from being the currency of tomorrow to a dystopian joke. 

• For a time, one of the easier ways to buy them was to first use Paypal to buy Linden dollars, the virtual currency in Second Life, then trade them within that make-believe universe for bitcoins. 

• The underworld's use of the bitcoin has matured, too: Silk Road is now just one of many Tor-enabled back alleys, including sites like Black Market Reloaded, where self-proclaimed hit men peddle contract killings and assassinations.

**And last but not least, my favorite sentiment from the article...**

• But Garzik, the developer, says that the most dedicated bitcoiners have stopped trying to hunt down Nakamoto. ""We really don't care,"" he says. It's not the individuals behind the code who matter, but the code itself. And while people have stolen and cheated and abandoned the bitcoiners, the code has remained true.

personalfinance,"Where to allocate extra funds? Student loans, mortgage, investments?","Hi all,

For about the past 2.5 years I've been very diligent about my budget usually spending around the exact amount that I've budgeted for each of my ""buckets."" That being said, I've allocated $250 in extra debt payments as one of my buckets meaning that after I make all of my minimum debt payments, I still have $250 in extra funds that I can throw at any of my debts. For your reference, I have roughly $44,000 in student loans (rates range between 3.8% and 4.88%) and $160k left on my mortgage (3% rate). No credit card debt or personal loans. I also contribute 8% to my 401k (+2% for employer match) and $200/month into a Roth IRA. 

Here's the dilemma...for the longest time I've been putting that extra $250 into my mortgage because I see that the mortgage is costing me about $14 in interest per day whereas my student loans are costing me about $6 interest/day. I've read many different posts about putting extra money towards your highest interest rate loans but that would technically mean putting that money towards my student loans rather than my mortgage. I've also read that if your loans have low interest rates (which I believe all of mine apply) that you should put extra money towards retirement/investments. 

I'm kind of lost at this moment because on one hand I want to get rid of my debt as quickly as possible but on the other I really would love to make the best financial decision for myself. Please let me know if there's a better place to put that $250/month other than making principal only mortgage payments.

For some additional context, I am 25 years old, living by myself at the moment but will be getting married and moving in with my SO in April 2023. I'm almost 3 years removed from college and am making ~$83k pretax.

personalfinance,Need credit card advice when I have cash,"I have $300k in cash that I'm holding onto and I want to use it as collateral for a low interest credit card.

Plus i want the purchase protection that credit cards offer and debit cards don't.  I was thinking of putting the cash into CDs and seeing if the bank would take a position in the CDs in exchange for a low interest rate (like 5%) credit card.  This isn't something they deal with daily so I imagine they have no idea how to do this and would impose some closing costs, which isn't something I'm interested in paying.

Here’s where I need advice!

Right now I have an investment account and ROTH IRA through the Acorns app. I put $20 a week into both. I am debating switching both to Vanguard or Fidelity because I’ve heard the returns are better.

My plan is to take $40k in Savings (leaving about $10K)

For the remainder of the credit card debt, I'm not sure the best option.  I have 2 choices.

1) Take a $40k loan from my 401k - I understand the downside, limiting gains to the loan interest rate.  It is important to note the 401k would still be quite healthy amount not in the loan - My monthly $2k CC payments basically becomes a $800 monthly loan payment 

2) Cash out stock (which would cover the rest). - Downside here is tax implications - and losing the future value.  Upside, $2k cc payment is wiped out and can put the majority of that back into savings.

stocks,"European stocks are the bargain of a lifetime, US stocks still overvalued","US stocks and international stocks have historically experienced periods where one outperforms the other, which happens in cycles.

The past 10-12 years, US stocks have massively outperformed European stocks. While the S&amp;P500 has tripled over the past 15 years, VGK, Vanguard's European stock index, has declined by 30%.

Many investors now are seeing these recent numbers, and no one wants to invest in Europe, as its seen as low growth. This has lead to the P/E and P/B ratios of VGK being approximately half of the S&amp;P500, and a dividend yield nearly 3 times the S&amp;P500.

In more recent terms, VGK is down 18.68% YTD, while the SP500 is down only 12.96%.

You may ask, ""but why would European stocks outperform the US now when they haven't the past 15 years?""

There are a number of factors that would suggest this:

1. Most European countries such as Germany have lower Debt to GDP ratios as a result of running budget surpluses the past decade, whereas the US has been stimulating its economy with excessive deficit spending. As interest rates rise, the US will have less ability to prop up its economy with deficit spending, and will need to make some difficult decisions about government spending and taxes.

2. Inflation in the US is currently much higher than Eurozone, at 7.5% vs 5.1%. This means the US will need to be more aggressive at raising rates, which is contractionary.

3. It is increasingly looking like the US will ban Russian oil imports, whereas most of Europe will not. 

All of these factors above establish an environment that sets the us up for Stagflation not much unlike the 70's oil crisis, where oil embargoes lead to rising oil prices, until the prices were eventually fixed, at which point shortages occured. During this time, international stocks substantially outperformed the US.
In addition:

4. The highest growth US companies that carried the market over the past decade are beginning to experience barriers to their growth. For example, Tesla being excluded from EV credits due to being non-union, increased government crackdowns and regulation on tech companies worldwide that threatens their revenue streams and margins, etc.

5. The rise of remote work will make the economy more globalized. It is becoming easier to hire in Europe where salaries are lower and unemployment is higher than compete for scarce talent in the US.

We are breaking into that ceiling currently and with the Nasdaq officially entering a correction, there is a VERY high probability the market will fall much further. While this is just a correlation, and a very tight one at that, the possibility of a direct causation is entirely plausible as oil is a commodity that effects nearly all aspects of our lives. It should be noted that foreign wars aren't the only things driving up prices, inflation has hit record highs with the 2 year treasury being close to matching the 10 yr treasury payout which is a phenomenal event. The only real upside to all of this is that corporate earning seem to be doing fine and the fed can still take actions to address inflation without likely escalading the situation which would not prevent a crash, but reduce the time it occurs. This is not financial advise, but I am hedging against further drops to my portfolio though inverse ETFs or other means to prevent excessive bleeding if a crash is to occur.  I am also still heavily invested in commodities such as oil and foods which are likely to keep rising with demand. Best of luck to everyone during these times.",finance,1646761337.0
personalfinance,Does it make sense to buy out my lease?,"My lease is coming to an end and I'm considering purchasing the car at the buyout price stated in my contract and recently confirmed by my dealership. The problem is, I'm not sure what makes the most sense from there. I could sell it and turn a quick profit, but I'm having trouble deciding if that makes sense:

\- To give some numbers, my car buyout price is about $10k less than what dealerships are offering to purchase my exact vehicle right now. (I've used the exact specifications and my VIN to get offer ranges.)

\- I've thought about buying the car in cash and immediately selling it to one of the dealerships, then buying a beater (in cash) until I find my next car. (With the car market right now and the long lead times to order vehicles, I'm in no rush.) Pros to this are that I can make a few thousand in profit that I can throw into investments. The downsides to this are 1. driving a beater that I may have to invest in within weeks or months, particularly because even beaters are priced sky-high right now and 2. paying CGT on the sale proceeds. Even though I wouldn't really be profiting when accounting for the fact that I leased the vehicle for 3 years/paid into it to the point I'm actually just breaking even, I think I'd still have to pay short-term capital gains tax since the buyout price is less than the price I can sell it for?

\- I've also thought about buying the car by financing, keeping it indefinitely (until I find my next vehicle), and then selling it once I do find my next vehicle. The pros are that I don't tie up so much cash by purchasing the vehicle in cash. The downside is that I obviously lose out on the opportunity to make some money on the vehicle (unless the car market stays insane for months and months). 

I'd love advice on what the most beneficial route is. I will likely purchase the car either way, as I'm significantly under my allocated mileage--AKA throwing away even more money by giving it back to the dealership 12k under mileage--and there's nothing else out there I want right now. But, as someone who admittedly just goes lease to lease, I want to know what the savvier option is.

TL;DR: deciding whether to buy my vehicle in cash and flip it or finance it and sell whenever I find a car I like. Based on the buyout price I negotiated at the start of my lease, I know I won't go under even if the market returns to 2019 car prices. It's just a matter of make money/pay CGT/drive an overpriced beater but still clear a profit to invest OR finance at great interest rate/drive familiar vehicle/sell for whatever it's worth when there's a different car I want.",finance,1646762984.0

defi,Biden to sign crypto order as industry faces pressure,"The US approach to cryptocurrency has attracted fresh attention in recent weeks as Washington has levied sanctions on Russia.

United States President Joe Biden’s team is under pressure to play more of a coordinating role as industry executives bemoan what they say is a lack of clarity on US rules.

President Joe Biden is set to sign an executive order this week that will outline the U.S. government’s strategy for cryptocurrencies, according to several people familiar with the administration’s plans.

The order will direct federal agencies to examine potential regulatory changes, as well as the national security and economic impact of digital assets, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing the deliberations.
 The White House’s approach to crypto has attracted fresh attention in recent weeks as Washington and its allies have levied sanctions on Russia, prompting concerns that firms and individuals there could use crypto to evade the restrictions.

With how innovative the space is, it is believed that they will offer a favorable report. I can't wait for more people to get involved in crypto trading and even copy trades from highly performing traders on Tycoon.

The order, which has been in the works since last year, will require federal agencies across the government to report later this year what they’re doing regarding digital assets.

CryptoCurrency,Gold vs BTC accounting for the M2 Money Supply,"Gold is currently rising and near an all-time high according to its USD value. Gold is often touted as the best type of store of wealth for generations and I myself have a position in gold and bitcoin.

The M2SL or M2 Money supply is the money being lent out from banks accounting for cash, checking deposits, and cash alternatives. It is a more comprehensive view of the money supply otherwise known as M1. Source: [M2 Definition (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp)

**Figure 1A.** The M2 Money supply over a period of time. We can notice that from 2020 the supply started to exponentially increase as the government went to zero banking reserves (which I believe to be the true Ponzi scheme, if you are interested I may make a write up about this.), dropped interest rates, and as a consequence the cost of borrowing and the availability of financing was in the extreme and led to this high growth of the money supply.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b1oe3wgbn7m81.png?width=2128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0429a693b093d2fc8323b96e455d1d4fb11ee2

 

Since the M2 is comprehensive on the circulating money, we can use this as a basis to compare certain assets against it, because theoretically with a higher money supply, more money gets deployed into the stock market. One Such example I wanted to particularly focus on was Gold and Bitcoin as they are both touted as the best stores of value. Ethereum with its new EIP1599 and upcoming triple halving is also beginning to look like sound money. Gold historically has done well and just because it has not moved and stands in a reaccumulation does not mean it may not experience a possible bull run.

**Figure 2A.** The Prices of Gold and Bitcoin in USD - Not accounting for the growth in money supply but simply their price history. The numbers represent the local tops of each chart.

**Figure 2B**. The Prices of Gold and Bitcoin in USD divided by M2 money supply. This is therefore accounting for the increase of money supply and measuring whether the asset can keep up with this inflation and erosion of purchasing power.

As I said not particularly bearish for gold at the moment, but you may observe that while Bitcoin has been breaking and moving up continuously against the money supply, gold has not put in an all-time high since 1979. I personally think that both Gold and Bitcoin can co-exist, and I believe if we are to see an event of ""Stagflation"" which is when the economy is facing weak fiscal growth with surging unemployment in combination with a high inflation rate.

This was seen in 70 and 80s with stagflation and it is also when gold's real bull market began to fade as the economy grew and so did the money supply - gold did too but it just didn't keep up. I would suggest the people of this subreddit examine the data, diversify their portfolio and look into buying commodities in combination with digital assets and currencies.

CryptoCurrency,3 Things to Watch For in the Coming Week(s),"**Three things to watch this week -**

**1. Federal Open Market Committee - FOMC (15-16 March)**

* This is when the US Government will announce it's strategy (or lack thereof) for addressing inflation (for example- raise interest rates), which can directly impact markets like crypto or stocks. Before the Russian/Ukraine conflict it appeared the Fed planned to come out more aggressive in March, which would potentially drop Bitcoin and crypto further.
* BUT with the new sanctions on Russia now impacting oil, this will weaken global supply chains and increase production costs (everything needs energy- factories, transportation, etc.), so increased energy costs add to the risk of a recession. This means the Fed is less likely to tighten monetary policy in the near term so as to not further spook the markets.
* If they choose a more cautious approach to tapering this will likely give strength back to crypto and other markets. At least in the short term.

\--

**2. The Russia/Ukraine Conflict**

* This is obviously dominating news cycles still. There are both bullish and bearish narratives to draw on here. In my opinion the positives are the truest story- that Ukraine raised much money for its defense via crypto. But some politicians in the US are focused on the potential to evade sanctions using crypto.
* We talked about this on the podcast and there are many reasons why it is highly unlikely Russians are evading sanctions on a large scale using crypto -
* First of all because the liquidity and exchange services aren't scaled to support an entire nation state moving/exchanging funds into it (yet) or even just the richest among them moving into crypto (thats still tens of billions of dollars).
* Continue monitoring the conflict and news cycle to see which narrative wins; and of course we hope for a de-escalation. If the conflict sees a path to resolution in the coming weeks, its very likely we see the market post a strong bounce.. then the question is how sustained is that bounce/rally, or is it a short-lived event.

\--

**3. US President's Executive Order on Crypto (likely release this week)**

* Note that Executive Orders aren't a highly detailed piece of law/legislation. They are (in basic terms) the President telling other government heads under his command to start doing something or start -researching and planning- to do something. But it takes time to research, propose, get budget approval and implement. Along the way things can trip up EOs, to include Congress blocking funding.
* In this case if he tells several departments of the US Government to research crypto with the goal of achieving a few things- it will still take time to complete, potentially months or years.
* That said, the President's tone and what he hopes to achieve with this EO will drive how markets respond. If he comes out largely supportive of crypto innovations but wants some common sense regulations then it could be bullish.  If he comes out attacking crypto or accusing it of being nothing more than a way for criminals to operate or Russians to avoid sanctions, the market will drop.

Currently have around 80k socked away in ETFs in a brokerage and another 20k in a 403(b). Only recurring expenses right now are rent/utilities, which come out to about $950.

The problem is that I’m fed up with my current quality of life— my apartment is gross, noisy, and doesn’t allow pets. But, I already feel guilty for living alone and paying what I currently am for living expenses, since my peers tend to live with housemates and pay more like $700/mo.

personalfinance,Using our equity in the most efficient way.,"Hey everyone we live in a small but growing Wyoming town. We aren't the most well off, but I was fortunate that my mother was hoping to move away and sold me her home for what she owed on the loan 135,000. After getting the yard in order repainting the kitchen and doing a bit of work on the porch it appraised at 175k. It has 2 bedrooms upstairs and a bathroom with what used to be a separate office opened into the livingroom that could be closed off to make a 3rd bedroom upstairs. It then has two completed rooms downstairs that were considered dens that we put egress windows in after the appraisal. We have room in the unfinished area for one more bedroom if we closed off a larger section in the basement.

We recently received a letter from the bank encouraging us to capitalize on the equity in our home. They estimated it in the current market and surrounding property values to be worth 249k. The basement is half finished. With the two rooms now completed we are considering finishing out the basement, fixing up the downstairs bathroom (the shower didn't have the drain pan put in properly) and putting in drywall and floors (most of the walls are framed out downstairs, only two need framed)

Would it be worth it to take out 20k to finish the basement? We are considering flipping it if we can get above 300k in value and buying something outright and not having a mortgage. I have an amazing interest rate of 2.5% on a first time home owner loan. That would change taking out the extra, but it would pay my pmi off. When getting a rough estimate from our loan advisor if we took out 20k our monthly would go from 746.20 to 1004.19 a month. 

Any advice? What would be most important to renovate when upping the value? Does anyone have a rough estimate they think we may be able to ask for if we flipped?

Open to any questions. Thanks for your time!


Tldr: Have a 2 bedroom home with an office open to the living room, and 2 basement rooms that didn't have egress windows before appraising. Loan value 132k current estimated value 249k. Is it worth it to refinance my fha loan with 2.5% interest to finish the house and flip?",finance,1646783271.0

personalfinance,Looking for Advice About Paying Down Credit Card Balances,"Hi folks! I'm absolutely dying to reduce the high-interest debt I've slowly accumulated over the last 15 years, but I'm not sure the best way to go about it. Maybe you have some ideas?

Here's the situation:

* I live in the U.S. My income is $48,000, but that is self-employment income before taxes. I am actively looking for a higher paying job. I have stable housing and health insurance.
* My credit score is \~700 and I make slightly more than the minimum payments on my debt every month. I don't have any late payments or delinquent accounts on my credit history, just very high balances.
* I've done a lot to budget and reduce my spending. All of my other expenses are consistently less than $1000 a month. Almost everything I earn goes toward debt payments. I don't own anything big like property that I could use as collateral or sell. My car is 16 years old, in great condition, and paid off. 
* I applied for a personal loan for debt consolidation with my credit union. They will lend me $25,000 at 11% interest, but in exchange, they want my husband to close his credit line that he keeps around for emergencies. I would prefer to come up with a solution that doesn't penalize him for my bad choices.
* I really want to avoid filing for bankruptcy. I am able to make my payments, I'm just frustrated that I'm not making any progress because of the high interest rates.
* If a solution requires it, I am okay with completely eliminating all of my revolving credit accounts

* Revolving Credit Total Balance: $40,137

personalfinance,How does a mortgage forbearance affect the ability to refinance?,"I currently have an FHA loan for our home. We were hit pretty hard in the middle of 2020 and were luckily able to do a Covid 19 forbearance for 6 months. We resumed payments December 2020 and have been making the payments ever since. 

Unfortunately that period also led to an impact in my credit. Been making a lot of gains since with the intention to refinance the loan and take advantage of low interest rates, but don’t think the credit is high enough yet to justify attempting the refi (current 4.25% rate, scores are 678, 657, and 619). Best thing I can do right now to improve the scores is pay down the credit card debt we had to take on when things were rough. 

So that’s the backstory, current situation is that between an insurance increase and property taxes our escrow is in the negative, causing our mortgage to increase a decent amount. All the extra that would be going to the increase was budgeted to aggressively pay down cards to help get the best loan rate possible during a refi. 

While looking through my statements I see that Covid forbearance is still offered through my loan servicer, my partner still hasn’t found a job since the worst of the pandemic hit. Last time we were in the forbearance they tacked the months we didn’t pay onto the tail end of loan. My plan at this point is to ask for forbearance again, us the money that would be going towards the mortgage to pay off cards, then refinance after the forbearance ends with what will hopefully be a much better credit score. 

So after all that, finally the question. Are there any possible consequences of a forbearance that would affect our ability to refinance the loan? Are there any other unintended consequences I’m not realizing?  Best I can tell from what I’ve read so far is that there might be a requirement that 3 months of normal payments be made after the forbearance ends, but I’m far from an expert here and I’m sure I’ve missed something. 

I appreciate anyone taking the time to read all this. Hopefully I’ve given enough information but I’m more than willing to answer any questions.",finance,1646784976.0

Saw this here and I thought I would try posting here too.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k3cne4/is\_ally\_invest\_really\_this\_bad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k3cne4/is_ally_invest_really_this_bad/)

I have a discrepancy with my 1099 and what is shown on the Ally Invest website. So apparently the tax lot allocation method I chose (HIFO and LIFO) sometime in 2021 was only for online viewing purposes and not for actual tax reporting. So now my 1099 reports a $4000 gain instead of what is shown on their website and what I was planning, which was a tax loss harvest of a -$4000 loss.

I've used some margin on the account and I am skeptical that their system is calculating it right or even if I am missing funds on my account since it looks like it reflects their online website and not what is even being reported.

Does anyone have any insight on this and if there's anyway to get it resolved or compensated which is probably really unlikely? I just contacted them through chat and they said there's no way to change the tax lots and that my account is calculated correctly. Really fed up with their mickey mouse investing website and planning to move my account over to a new brokerage after this.",finance,1646788111.0

solar,"Ordered a 12.6kw system, here’s my story. Dealer pricing*","So decided to go solar. I had a company come quote me a setup for 11.x kwh for 54k on a 1.99% interest loan at 162$/mo for 25 years. I signed the contract on Saturday and started my research. I realized they were offering me q-cell and microinverters and the install/financing was approx 34K of the cost (assuming 20k parts cost). I ended up cancelling the contract Monday. Also they told me they sold/installed and warrantied the equipment themselves when the contract was with another company called palmetto. Also the 25yr warranty from a company that only has been in business for 4 years hold less value. 

I then applod for Tesla solar as they are cheaper than anybody. I paid the fee and uploaded like 15 pictures. Seemed good and was waiting. I even called and spoke to someone who allowed me to upload more power bills as I had only gotten one and it locked me out. I was supposed to get a call from my specialist who didn’t call. I did more and more research into string vs microinverters, and come to the conclusion I’m leaning towards microinverters. 

I get a call from a random company who called due to me putting my info on a website, probably my 4-5th call. They talked me into talking to the sales guy the next day. Today I got the call and he didn’t bill shit me. He game me the difference between cash price and loan price without trying to pull the wool over my eyes. The difference between 1.99% and 0% pricing. I finally understand why the loan company gives “dealer pricing” which is like 21-26% higher than cash price. 

Turns out a similar (slightly larger 12.6kw) system would be 44k with 1.99% interest and 142/no or 53k at 0% interest. So I’m 10k in the green compared to my previous contract. Then I look into a heloc loan for the same amount and it’s 4.97% and cost &gt;200$/month. So that’s not preferable. 

I then realize the whole dealer pricing scheme is to get the money they would get from interest upfront and collect more from the federal tax credit to partially fund it. So you’re paying more in total cost funded but the 26% but the government subsidizes a greater portion of the system cost. Crazy, I’ve done a whole 180 degree on my opinion on the dealer fees. 

So the new company uses rec395aa panels and iq7+ whereas the previous company was 10K more for Q-cell 400w panel with less guaranteed functionality at 20yrs. I’m not sure of the microinverters used, as they never included it in the contract/quote. 

I canceled the Tesla system in favor of the better efficiency and guaranteed functionality for 25yrs. I bowed down to the dealer fees and even added an enphase 10kw battery. Total cost with financing was 75k with a 20k federal credit coming to 55k and 184$/month. Also I’m getting a sub panel with it, necessary I think. Which I need to gain space for a new outlet for a welder which would have been like 2-5k just to get the space anyway. I know there  are half width breakers but I won’t need them now. 

Hopefully it all works out. Financing is done and now I need HOA approval for the system. I can’t fit all the panels on the rear of the house, so I’m getting some on the front and on the shed in the back with a trench for the wires to connect all of it together. I can’t honestly see a single more panel added to the system without putting some on the north side of the shed or ground mounting (not preferable for my house and backyard)

Anyways, wish me luck on the new system. And hopefully this sheds some light on reason why I accepted ridiculous dealer fees. You’re paying all the interest up front to allow for a greater federal tax credit to help pay for it. Although they can’t say that as it would probably be against federal rules. The down side is that you can’t save any interest by paying it off early, since you paid all of it upfront on the 0% loan. So you have to ride it out for 25yrs.",energy,1646796218.0

Right now there are two separate loans, both variable interest rates at 1% and 2%.

btc,Observations About The Bitcoin Project,"Having been involved with crypto for many years now, there are a few points that I would like to make, based on my observations.

Observation 1) The Bitcoin project has already been hijacked by Blockstream, likely with the backing of government actors. 2 years ago, I wrote about some evidence suggesting this at https://read.cash/@MobTwo/bitcoin-cash-is-under-attack-and-we-need-your-help-727c6939

I cannot think of anyone else so motivated as to waste money over the past 5 years trying to undermine the efforts of Bitcoin Cash. By now, it is obvious. BTC’s Lightning Network is collaborating with existing government actors such as World Economic Forum and BTC’s Lightning Network was listed on the World Economic Forum’s website. Cory Fields, a BTC developer, is working with the Federal Reserve to create a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency).

We could also see a shift in how banks and institutions, normally hostile towards cryptocurrencies are suddenly singing the praises of BTC. It is also not surprising to see traditional media and government employees singing the praises of BTC, since the US government has control over the project.

Observation 2) I was very disappointed about how the whole project derailed. I genuinely believe in the benefits of peer to peer money for the world. I was an idealist but I am also pragmatic. It is easy to criticize people like Adam Back or Cory Fields for working with the government. I would argue that good people will do bad things if being forced to.

Why would someone like Adam Back suddenly changed from supporting blocksize increase to sabotaging the project? Because if we were being coerced to do something, we would probably have done the same thing. The same way soldiers were made to commit war crimes and kill innocent children. I have no doubt many soldiers are good decent people, yet they will do bad things when they are being instructed to. It is hard to say no especially when the instructions are accompanied by coercion.

Observation 3) It is my opinion that the current crypto market is heavily manipulated by the fraudulent Tethers and their cartel of insiders. I could list down all the data points suggesting this but unfortunately, I’m just not interested enough to spend more time on this. If one were to spend enough time googling, it would be easy to find evidence of fraud all over Tether USDT.

Observation 4) An inflationary monetary system benefits the early recipients of those money while a deflationary monetary system benefits humankind. I won’t explain why money printing benefits the early recipients the most as this is a well covered topic already. But I will argue that when money is deflationary, people will spend their money much more carefully, buying only what they really want. I believe this will lead to less wastage and a huge drop in pollution globally, benefiting the planet and mankind as a whole. It is easy to be wasteful when money is inflationary and if you don’t consume, those money will become worthless over time. Obviously, we will spend them while there is still value.

And since governments can’t print money anymore, there will also be less wars since the war mongering governments can no longer print money to fund wars, wars which most people have little interests in. I’m not interested in seeing my money being spent to harm or kill someone from another country, absolutely no interest at all.

Observation 5) I would like to emphasize the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to humanity at https://slp.1bch.com/index.asp?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

I strongly believe in the value of Bitcoin Cash, even if it is just to preserve the freedom and liberty of people. That alone is valuable to me but of course, Bitcoin Cash is more than that.

personalfinance,"24 Year Old First Time ""House Hacking"" FHA vs Conventional Question","Hello Everyone and thank you for taking your time to read this post.

&amp;#x200B;

A brief summary of my background:

24 Years Old in Houston Texas with no student debt (currently renting in an apartment with car entirely paid off), 65k gross income with a 750 credit score and around 7k in savings and another 7k in 401k (roth and traditional). I don't have kids or elderly parents that'll forcibly keep me in one location/home. I have one full year of work experience at my old company and now I have just began working at a new company this February.

My plan is to save up for a down payment for a home in which I plan to house hack (living in a duplex/triplex for one year while renting out the other units).

I have read about the options for the 20% conventional loan and have also read about the 3.5% FHA loan and although the lower down payment on a home is tempting, I understand that that comes at a cost with higher PMI and other expenses. From my understanding, with a FHA loan, you do have the option to refinance it to a conventional loan and that is what I plan to do once the payments for the FHA loan exceeds what would be the interest rate for a conventional loan.

I don't expect to be able to get a home any time soon within the next 0-1 years (especially with the current housing market) but would like to have a plan established for when things loosen up and I have a bigger saving amount for that.

To throw out numbers, with my 65k gross income salary, taking taxes, food, gas other factors into account, I see myself realistically having about 30k in savings living frugally after this year.

With this number, what would be some of my options and recommendations moving forward?

From my understanding I can do

1. Wait the additional 2-3 years and save up for 20% down payment for a conventional loan + closing fees
2. Wait the additional year and with the intention for a 3.5% FHA loan to be refinanced to a  conventional loan once PMI payments exceeds the interest rate amount that I would have paid if I did a traditional 20% down payment conventional loan
3. Wait the additional 3-4 years and save up for a 25-30% down payment for a conventional loan + closing fee (competitve housing market from what I've seen so this would be a safety blanket plan while waiting for the market to \*hopefully\* go down)

&amp;#x200B;

Also as an example, so I could get a better understanding, some of the areas I have been looking into where I may want to ""house hack"" would be within the 200k-400k range. So with those numbers that I provided, I would expect to have this much as a down payment (excluding closing cost in these for simplicity)

FHA 3.5% down payment: 7k-14k

20% Conventional down payment: 40k-80k

Please correct me if i'm wrong in this example so that I may learn.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I was not sure if this would go in the planning or housing flair, so please correct me if its in the wrong one.

CryptoCurrency,"Why Wednesday, March 9 could be an important day for Bitcoin","U.S. President Joe Biden is just busy. Besides plenty of geo-political matters and internal economic struggles, his team is preparing an executive order on cryptocurrency policy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Possibly as early as Wednesday, March 9**

Reuters quotes an anonymous source as saying that this new executive order could be signed as early as Wednesday, March 9. This order would amount to assigning one regulatory authority to oversee the crypto market. In the Netherlands, all crypto companies fall under the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regulation rather than prohibition**

It is clear by now that the whole world, the United States included, wants more regulation and oversight for the local crypto sector. The other two alternatives are a ban or no regulation at all. Since no regulation at all is no longer a reality, most crypto companies have resigned themselves to more regulation. Anything is better than a ban.

&amp;#x200B;

*""The executive order, which has been in the works since last year, requires federal agencies across the government to report what they are doing with respect to digital tokens later this year,""* the anonymous source told Reuters. *""The plan is expected to begin outlining roles for agencies across the government, from the State Department to the Commerce Department.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**Who will be in charge?**

Last month, Rostin Behnam, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), told a Senate committee that his agency wanted to be charged with regulating the crypto spot market. During that hearing, Benham was asked if a lead agency for regulating crypto should be created, and he said his agency, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), should share the responsibility.

&amp;#x200B;

It is also quite possible that a new role will be created to keep an eye on the crypto sector. Michael Fasanello, director of Blockchain Intelligence Group said in January that a new person would be given oversight powers over multiple government agencies. These include the CFTC, the SEC, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Office of the Comptroller, Fasanello said.

&amp;#x200B;

Hester Pierce of the SEC (and known for her pro-bitcoin views), on the other hand, said that a new role would only create more confusion in an already ""fragmented regulatory system.""

&amp;#x200B;

**More and more rules**

Since the bull run began in 2020, more and more regulations have been added in the US. The good old days when we all thought we could play pirates or cowboys seem to be fading to a distant memory. Still, the rules differ from country to country. For example, in the Netherlands you only have to pay wealth tax on your crypto if it is worth more than 50 thousand euros on January 1.

&amp;#x200B;

In the US, traders have to pay tax on every profitable trade. Exchanges have to report to the tax authorities and lawmakers are breathing hard and warm on the necks of stablecoins. The value of stablecoins are generally linked to fiat currency and, as a result, are sometimes seen as privately issued dollars. And that, of course, is a threat to the real dollar.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department insisted on a requirement for individuals to report transactions of more than $10,000 in crypto to the IRS. Currently, bitcoin is on the agenda of Americans for other reasons. The whole world is seeing how Ukrainians can receive bitcoin donations despite the war; it seems a matter of time before $100 million worth of bitcoin is donated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns about crypto in Russia**

In addition, virtually the entire world is pushing Russia into economic and financial isolation. This has the unpleasant side effect of preventing Russian citizens from freely receiving or sending money abroad. Bitcoin offers a way out of this form of censorship. It seems that this is being used on a small scale by citizens. There are no reports of Russian companies or the government using bitcoin to circumvent sanctions.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, American politicians have expressed concern about such a possibility. Leading the way is Senator Elizabeth Warren, who sent a letter to the Treasury Department inquiring about plans to combat Russian use of bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

CryptoCurrency,USA to sign executive order directing agencies to study cryptocurrencies and a central bank digital currency (CBDC),"President Joe Biden on Wednesday will officially sign an executive order directing agencies to study cryptocurrencies and a central bank digital currency (CBDC), and come up with a government-wide approach to regulating digital assets.

The long-awaited order lays out a national policy for digital assets across priorities, including, consumer and investor protection, financial stability, illicit finance, maintaining U.S. leadership in the global financial system and financial inclusion.

The move was originally expected last month, a source previously told Yahoo Finance, but the timetable was derailed by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis.

“We need to be clear-eyed that earlier forms of financial innovation have ended up hurting American families, while making a small group of people very rich, which underscores the need for robust consumer protection,” said a senior administration official.

The order will direct the U.S. Treasury to lead a report on a CBDC, in consultation with the Departments of Justice, State, Commerce, Homeland Security, Office of Management and Budget and Director of National Intelligence, to analyze whether a digital dollar is sound policy for the U.S. to pursue.

The administration is looking at CBDC pros and cons, as the U.S. looks to maintain the dollar’s central role in the international global financial system.

The White House supports the Federal Reserve’s efforts to explore a CBDC. In January the Fed issued a white paper exploring the pros and cons of issuing a digital dollar, while the Boston Fed is studying the mechanics of designing one best suited for use in the U.S. economy, should officials pursue one.

The DOJ is also tasked with determining whether a new law is needed to issue a CBDC, something China has already done with its digital yuan. Fed Chair Jay Powell has said Congress would need to authorize the central bank to issue a similar token.

“China might have been the first large, industrialized nation to launch a CBDC with the digital yuan, but it will not be the last. Far from it,” noted deVere Group’s Nigel Green.

“Indeed, the U.S. now appears to be playing ‘catch up,’” he said, calling digital currencies “are an inevitability in the ever more digital world that we live in.”

Laying the foundation

Meanwhile, the Office of Science Technology Policy will do an analysis of the technical aspects of a CBDC, and work with the Environmental Protection Agency on analysis of the environmental impact of digital assets.

The order also directs Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, along with other agencies, to produce a report on the future of money and payment systems, and include the potential impact on economic and financial growth, inclusion and national security.

Treasury is also tasked with leading a report in consultation with federal banking regulators – along with the FTC, SEC and CFTC – on what measures to take to protect consumers, investors and businesses. Recently, a wave of fraud, theft, and cyberattacks of crypto assets have left investors holding the bag

The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), created after the 2008 financial crisis to monitor risks to the system, will be asked to study what systemic risks digital assets pose to the financial system, with a focus on runs and what can be done to prevent them. The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets has already tasked the FSOC with looking into systemic risks of stablecoins.

The government will also work on coordinating crypto regulations internationally to prevent gaps in regulatory supervision, ensure compliance across jurisdictions, and guard against arbitrage in crypto cross border.

Senior administration officials say the insufficiency of international implementation of anti-money laundering networks and frameworks is the greatest vulnerability of the crypto ecosystem, which criminals are exploiting.

While there are suspicions crypto could be used to evade sanctions on Russia, the White House insists crypto is not a viable workaround for those penalties. The administration is continuing to take action started before Russia’s invasion, including under law enforcement and existing Treasury authority, as part of the U.S. anti-ransomware strategy that’s been underway for several months.

The EO also seeks to push innovation and promote U.S. economic competitiveness and leadership in the global financial system by directing Commerce to work across the government to create a crypto competitiveness framework.

Cryptocurrencies have exploded in growth, topping $3 trillion in market cap last November, up from $14 billion just five years prior, but recent volatility in the sector has shaved that figure to under $2 trillion. Surveys suggest that around 16% of American adults – approximately 40 million people – have invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrencies.

Studies will last 90-180 days on average. After the studies are complete, the Treasury will collect the information and then make recommendations on what to do next.

While the president’s order won’t make actual policy yet, it’s a step towards offering clarity for the crypto industry, which is starving for rules of the road and is disrupting the banking industry and global payment system.

The president’s executive order comes after the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets – composed of all major financial regulatory agencies – tasked Congress with coming up with a new regulatory framework to oversee stablecoins while recommending that only banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins, a variety of cryptocurrencies, are tied in value to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or Euro to counter volatility.

At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading Commission are looking at how to regulate crypto and whether the digital tokens should be classified as securities or commodities, though no formal rules have been proposed.

Members of Congress are slowly putting forth or soon expected to put forth legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies, though none yet appears to have a chance of being signed into law this year.

# [Dow futures climb nearly 500 points as commodity prices ease amid war in Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****

*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 458 points, or about 1.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 1.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 2%.
*****
&gt; The gains came amid an easing in commodity prices that have spooked the broader market. Energy and agriculture products in particular have catapulted higher amid the fighting in Ukraine, while some metals also have posted major gains.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, was last down 2.2% to $120.92, while Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.7% to $125.78. Wheat futures also were sharply lower, falling 6.3% to $1,206 a bushel, though palladium continued its march higher, rising 3.8% to $3,082 per ounce.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields also climbed as investors focused on the overall trend of higher inflation. The benchmark 10-year note rose about 3.7 basis points to 1.91%. A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
&gt; Pepsico shares rose 1.8% in premarket trading after the soft drink giant said it will suspend sales in Russia, though it will continue to sell snacks and essentials such as baby formula. Elsewhere, shares of dating service Bumble soared nearly 23% after it reported profit and expected growth that was much better than Wall Street expectations.
*****
&gt; The major averages all closed lower Tuesday after a day of whipsaw trading. The Dow gave up a 585-point gain to end the day lower by 184 points, falling deeper into its correction. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.7%, in correction territory. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2%, after entering bear market territory Monday.
*****
&gt; The market volatility was driven by uncertainty among investors as they continued to assess surging prices in commodities like oil, gasoline, natural gas and precious metals. That fueled concerns about a slowdown in global growth amid surging inflation.
*****
&gt; It remains to be seen if the Federal Reserve will manage a soft economic landing, but the U.S. should be able to avoid a recession, according to Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.
*****
&gt; “The strength of the U.S. labor market, consumer and aggregate corporate sector should act as the weight to keep us out of recession near-term,” he told CNBC. “Overall, volatility is likely to persist, [there’s a] wide range of outcomes possible in Ukraine, but the fundamentals of the U.S. economy still look decent, especially if the Fed can navigate raising rates without breaking demand.”
*****
&gt; Energy stocks were a bright spot in the market as oil prices continued to climb, jumping to their highs of the session as President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian fossil imports, including oil, in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine. That was after oil hit a 13-year high of $130 to start the week.
*****
&gt; Other commodity prices resumed their push higher, including nickel, which touched a new record above $100,000 a metric ton.
*****
&gt; Earnings continue Wednesday with Campbell Soup, Crowdstrike and Marqeta all set to report.

CryptoCurrency,"to those who think ""JP Morgan owning exchanges and ETFs is GREAT NEWS!""...ARE YOU FUCKING HIGH?","These banks and hedge funds that your so excited about entering the crypto sphere are admitted market manipulators, why the hell would you trust they wouldn't do the same manipulation and spoofing in the crypto market that they do in other markets? And don't forget that they trashed crypto FOR YEARS! Bbut despite all that I see posts all the time here and elsewhere praising their entry like they will be Moses of crypto leading the masses to adoption. WTF?

JP Morgan paid a $900 MILLION dollar fine in 2020 after 8 years of manipulation of the precious metals market. Frankly they got off easy given they made far more that 900 million but the point is they acknowledged that they spoofed (faked) either demand or supply to make money on their comex future positions. Look👇

https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-spoofing-case-pays-fine-admits-wrongdoing-market-manipulation-traders-2020-9-1029631935?op=1

They were also partly responsible for the Malaysin 1mdb scandal and paid over 5 billion between the u.s. Malaysia and honk Kong in 2020, and it goes on and on. They are constantly paying fines that amount to nothing compared to their gains.

Now they own a large stake in metamask, they are looking for regulatory approval for an ETF (which is how they manipulate precious metals markets),  and are now providing exchanges like Coinbase with banking services.

CryptoCurrency,CKB... technical analysis and prospects.,"Today, we will analyze CKB briefly, a project that we are inspecting here at **runus,** and try to create a full report based on the facts we find. We are still doing research, but I try to create a small summary for people who are willing to invest in it and crypto in general right now.

As a small introduction, CKB is a token of the project Nervous Network, an open-source public blockchain ecosystem with a total market cap of 334M $. The last few months were a pain point for crypto as you can see, with a sustainable downtrend that gives no sign of changing. Right now, CKB price is reaching an important area known as support, on a higher timeframe (Daily), which can become an important reversal point if all the necessary macroeconomic conditions point to that.

On a lower timeframe (4h), the price in a consolidation period for the last 15 days, which is an opportunity for range traders that can take advantage of price movement between 0.01 and 0.012. For swing traders and long-term investors, I would advise taking no actions at the moment due to the equally distributed probability of price going in either direction (up or down). From a simple chart analysis, price action has a typical pullback pattern, with a strong reaction of price on 24 February and a retest that took place a few days ago. This pullback has chances to achieve the range of 0.013 and 0.015 with ease, but I will take care of other facts to open a position right now.

Tomorrow, Thu, March 10, the **Inflation Rate** will be announced which has a greater impact on the stock market and also on the crypto. As you know, in the last years, the whole crypto market has had a significant correlation with the technology market, which is highly influenced by interest rates and global uncertainty.

I encourage all the traders and investors, to stay calm and do NOTHING till March 16 when the Federal Reserve will announce the decision upon **Interest rates**. Any rise in standard rates will be catastrophic for the technology sector and also for the cryptocurrency market. However, if mister Powell has the mercy to keep the rates at 0.25, this is a bullish sign for crypto, but I don't believe this. The inflation rate at the moment is too high and the federal bank both in the USA and Europe did almost nothing to stop this so far. (Thank you, Powell!! ... See you in hell =))).

Going back to CKB, at the moment there are chances to see a rise in price until March 16, and then a continuation of the downtrend. For opening a position (short or long), I would suggest to any investor to take into consideration all the macroeconomic aspects and social media hype of the coin that they choose to trade. Dont forget people are irrational investors with or without money to make a considerable movement in price.

TLDR: Wait until 16 March to see the interest rate decision.",cryptocurrency,1646834775.0

CryptoCurrency,A degen's summary of Biden's crypto executive order,"Today Joe Biden signed into effect an executive order directing federal agencies to coordinate their efforts at drafting crypto regulations. This is a first of its kinds executive order, and its going to take a while for these separate government agencies to draft their regulations.

You're probably already sick of reading by now so lets get into the meat of the EO (executive order).

Preface:

1. **this EO will not outline specific positions that Biden wants, such as directing the SEC to take harsher penalties on rugging. He doesn't want to seem pro or against crypto even though this EO is pretty pro crypto.**
2. **One part of this EO is that it will direct the US Treasury department to create a report on the ""future of money"" including how the current financial system may not be right for some current consumer needs.**
3. **THE EXECUTIVE ORDER FOCUSES ON GROWING THE DIGIAL ASSET SECTOR SAFELY FOR CONSUMERS**
4. **This executive order doesn't create any laws or regulations. It simply forces government agencies who has been ignoring crypto to stop ignoring crypto.**

**The EO is regarded as a ""whole government"" effort to regulate crypto and it focuses on 6 main goals:**

1. **Consumer protection**: This is the chief goal of the EO and part will go to understanding the technology as well as the volatile micro and macro-economics of the crypto industry. A better understanding on the governments end will help the government better understand where the current popular financial system is failing some consumers. My opinion on this is that the government will plan on helping government agencies aid businesses in crypto adoption as an effort to lessen the massive volatility in crypto that has rekt so many people.
2. **financial stability**: this plays into the consumer protection part of the Executive Order. The president wants the financial sector to be less volatile. quoting the price pre-covid (10,300), November 2021 (70,000) and currently (38,000). Using this as a benchmark he wants government agencies to educate more people including themselves on why this volatility happens and how to help prevent this kind of instability through encouraged adoption.
3. **illicit uses**: I mean its a bunch of boomers. Did you expect them not to be scared of criminals using crypto LMAO. I'm sure they're going to enact some laws that crack down on criminals using crypto which will then never be used, because they inherently cant. The EO also states that the DOJ and FBI each have their own crypto investigation units that need more funding. ""The insufficiency of international implementation of anti-money laundering networks and frameworks with digital assets is the greatest vulnerability of these ecosystems the criminals are currently exploiting."" I mean c'mon this senior advisor to the president is basically saying that crypto's worst problem is money laundering? that's bullish AF.
4. **promoting responsible innovation**: senior advisors have said that crypto is creating thousands of jobs in a brand new industry. Innovation is a pivotal role in the American economy and the government does not want to be left behind when it comes to innovation.
5. **financial inclusion**: This exact thing has not really been defined but I can define it, because I want to. I'm assuming this aspect is related to the ""future of money"" publication by the Treasury as well as the future plans to evaluate the necessity of a ""digital dollar"" issued by the central banks. This will undoubtedly increase financial inclusion and level the playing field because some consumers are either scared or confused by crypto and less likely to adopt.
6. **U.S. Leadership**: This is more of an all encompassing part of the EO that is basically saying ""we need all government agencies leadership to get on the bandwagon or we as a country will fail at the innovation we have whored ourselves out for since the reconstruction era."" The senior advisor was quoted saying, ""We remain committed to working with allies in the broader digital asset community to shape the future of digital assets systems in a manner thats' inclusive, consistent with our Democratic values, and safeguard the integrity of the global financial system.""

TL;DR: Biden signed a bullish ass executive order that begs every government agencies to stop ignoring crypto and create legislation/regulations that will protect the consumer, level the volatility, and create a level playing field for the average consumer. Citing the need for innovation as well as adoption. Digital dollar issuance is mentioned as well as a ""future of Money"" report by the US Treasury that will surely outline how other government agencies should look at crypto regulation standards.

investing,Silver in 2022: Is it a good investment?,"Silver is the second most popular precious metal after gold and one of the go-to inflation investments. When I'm looking at everything that has been happening over the last few months, it feels like it's a good time to talk about silver again. What drives the price of silver and is silver a good investment right now? When it comes to silver, there are a few things that influence the price.

# 1. Supply and Demand

First of all, like any commodity you have supply and demand. What makes silver different from gold is the fact that silver is much more important for the industry. Gold is mainly mined for investment purposes with only 10% of the demand for gold coming from the industry. When it comes to silver, industry accounts for almost half of all demand! Plus, silver demand is growing because of industries like renewable energy and electric vehicles. Just in 2020, 101 million ounces of silver was used in solar panels! Electric vehicles also require several times more silver than normal vehicles. Silver is also widely used in electronics and also during brazing and soldering. Basically, there is a constant, growing demand for silver in the industry. In fact, this has led to the first silver market deficit in 6 years! In 2022, silver demand is expected to hit 1.112 billion ounces compared to a supply of only 1.092 billion ounces. It's a small deficit of only 20 million, but it still shows that demand has started to outpace supply. In 2021, silver demand was just 1.033 billion ounces compared to a supply of 1.056 billion ounces. Essentially, demand has gone up by 7.6% whereas supply has only gone up by only 3.4%. Again, there isn't a massive difference between supply and demand right now, ***but*** if the trend continues, this could really start pushing the price of silver up! Demand for silver jewelry and silver as a physical investment are also going up by more than 10% so that's yet another trend that can positively influence silver prices. I'll add the link to the resources in the description below for you take a look, too.

# 2. Inflation

Then, secondly, we have inflation. Commodities and precious metals are real, physical goods and as such their price is positively affected by inflation. If you are not sure why that's the case, let me break it down for you. Inflation is basically the decline of the purchasing power of a currency. Essentially, the same amount of money buys less of a specific good, commodity or service. Therefore, in times of high inflation, investors buy more commodities to preserve some of their purchasing power which is why these commodities are referred to as a store of value. Really, any asset that maintains its value over time can be a store of value which includes real estate, stocks, even currency when inflation is low. Now, the most popular commodity as a store of value is gold, followed by silver. The funny thing here is that, actually, gold and silver are not as strongly correlated to inflation as other commodities. However, they are still one of the classic picks for inflation hedging or safe-haven during volatile or bad market conditions.

That's ***exactly*** what we have right now. The current inflation levels around the world are record-high. The US, UK and Eurozone are hitting record inflation levels that we have last seen 30 or 40 years ago. In January, US Inflation hit 7.5%, UK inflation hit 5.5% with the Retail Price Index going up 7.8%, while the Eurozone and Canada's inflation rates both hit 5.1%. What's more, the current economic conditions are set for more volatility and even higher inflation. Banks have started to raise interest rates to stabilise inflation, but by the looks of it, it could be out of their control. Lumber prices are going up. Wheat prices are going up. Aluminium is going up. Oil is going up. Gas is going up. You get the point. The more these commodities go up, the higher costs will be for companies and the more expensive it will be to produce goods. This will put a pressure on inflation and it will likely continue to rise over the coming months. This is one of the main reasons why investors are looking at gold and silver right now. If inflation continues to go up and exceeds expectations, silver and gold will perform ***extremely*** well.

# 3. Gold Price Correlation

The third factor that influences silver prices is the gold price! Silver is correlated with gold, meaning that the price of silver tends to follow the price of gold. When gold goes up, silver typically goes up, too. However, silver has a higher beta than gold which means that it is more volatile. If gold goes up 1%, silver is likely to go up by 2%. Vice versa, if gold goes down 1%, then silver may go down by 2%. This is another reason why there is so much interest in silver. The inflation situation could become worse with inflation going much higher than most investors and central banks expect. In that situation, gold will go higher in price, which would also lead to higher silver prices. However, as we now know, silver is more volatile and will likely see a much bigger increase in price than gold!

# 4. Geopolitical Tensions

The final factor is geopolitical tensions. Anyone who has been watching the news recently will know that there are a lot of them right now. Like I said previously, gold and silver are two of the designated safe-haven assets for investors so in times of market or international turmoil, silver and gold typically go up in price. Gold and silver have been around since the dawn of civilization so it's no wonder that investors flock to them when they are worried and want some safety. That's another reason why we have seen a big jump in their prices in recent weeks, too.

# Price predictions and forecasts

Now, I guess the question on everyone's mind is how high can silver prices actually go? In March of 2020, silver skyrocketed to almost $30 dollars and has been moving between $22 and $28 dollars since then. Most recently, silver prices were floating around $22.5 dollars, but the war in Ukraine has pushed silver prices back up to almost $26 dollars. Can we expect even higher prices by the end of the year? Well, some analysts expect silver prices to remain the same for most of the year, before falling down to $22 dollars in December. Other analysts are more bullish and are seeing prices around $26 to $28 dollars, but they also lean towards lower prices by December 2022. Then, we've got the diehard fans of silver who are seeing silver prices of $500 to $1,200 dollars, but I think the chances of this happening are pretty minimal. Generally, there are not a lot of analysts who are seeing silver hitting the prices of up to $50 dollars which we saw in 2011 and most agree that by December 2022, we will see silver starting to decline and continuing that decline for a couple of years.

Obviously, that is not great news for silver investors and stackers, but I think that the analysts are a bit pessimistic in their price forecasts. We've seen that the demand for silver is going up and will continue to go up while the silver supply is shrinking. We've seen that there are inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions around the world. Depending on when these cool down, I think that silver can go up to $30, even $35 dollars within the next 12 months, but it does make sense that prices will stabilise and decline after that as long as inflation cools down. Still, the current gold-to-silver-price ratio is just under 80 which means that silver is relatively cheap compared to gold right now. Over the last 25 years, the ratio has typically stayed around levels of 65 to 70 so silver is looking like a good purchase right now, at least to me and I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Plus, it is important to remember that assets like silver and gold are long-term investments so you should be prepared to be patient if you are buying in.

So, that's what I've got to say about silver right now. What do you think? Are you bullish on silver or not?",finance,1646837804.0

XRP,Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,"**Disclaimer:** This is not directly related to XRP, but I thought that it was worth discussing as it impacts the entire sector and sets precedent on what path the US is headed in. 

You can read the full executive order [here.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)

I’m going to list out key aspects that stood out to me and appear indirectly relevant to the XRPL and it’s methodologies. Feel free to discuss and also point out things I may have missed.

&gt;	Monetary authorities globally are also exploring, and in some cases introducing, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). 

XRPL is positioned well for CBDCs with the native currency, XRP, being a neutral bridging asset.

&gt;	We must reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness, including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets. The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system, particularly in setting standards that promote:  democratic values; the rule of law; privacy; the protection of consumers, investors, and businesses; and interoperability with digital platforms, legacy architecture, and international payment systems.

Such as Ripple, the private company, developing RippleNet as a direct and more efficient competitor to SWIFT. Additionally ODL utilizing XRP to further enhance the efficiency of the entire flow of money.
If only the SEC would stop being corrupt…

&gt;	The United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible innovation that expands equitable access to financial services, particularly for those Americans underserved by the traditional banking system, including by making investments and domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments cheaper, faster, and safer, and by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services.

Again… XRPL… RippleNet… ODL… 

&gt;	Any future dollar payment system should be designed in a way that is consistent with United States priorities (as outlined in section 4(a)(i) of this order) and democratic values, including privacy protections, and that ensures the global financial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity, and platform and architecture interoperability or transferability, as appropriate.

XRPL was built with interoperability at its core while having the first ever DEX. It has pathfinding and many other features that makes it a breeze to transfer various different assets with minimal friction.

&gt;	A United States CBDC that is interoperable with CBDCs issued by other monetary authorities could facilitate faster and lower-cost cross-border payments and potentially boost economic growth, support the continued centrality of the United States within the international financial system, and help to protect the unique role that the dollar plays in global finance.

CBDCs seem to be a hot topic. Ripple has been ahead of the curve when they started pushing for them well on the XRPL over a year or two ago.

&gt;	Technology-driven financial innovation is frequently cross-border and therefore requires international cooperation among public authorities.  This cooperation is critical to maintaining high regulatory standards and a level playing field. Uneven regulation, supervision, and compliance across jurisdictions creates opportunities for arbitrage and raises risks to financial stability and the protection of consumers, investors, businesses, and markets. 

Such as the SEC’s absurd overreach and corruption? The rest of the world already seems XRP as a currency. The SEC is virtually one of the only governmental entities in the world who says otherwise.


&gt;	Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the President on the connections between distributed ledger technology and short-, medium-, and long-term economic and energy transitions; the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad; and the impacts these technologies have on the environment.  This report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order.  The report should also address the effect of cryptocurrencies’ consensus mechanisms on energy usage, including research into potential mitigating measures and alternative mechanisms of consensus and the design tradeoffs those may entail.  

XRPL is carbon neutral since it uses a Federated Consensus algorithm and was built with scalability and sustainability in mind.



Again, as per my disclaimer at the top none of this is directly related to the XRPL. However it appears that a lot of the key focuses in this order lines up with the core principals the XRPL was built on and the main problems it solves such as interoperability/bridging different currencies (both physical and digital), energy efficiency, mechanisms to responsibly handle payments, and so on so forth.",cryptocurrency,1646844107.0

Also, if we go with another lender, we'd lose $20k in incentives (from the builder and lender).

personalfinance,Would it be a bad decision to hire a financial advisor that isn’t a fiduciary?,"So I’m (28f) currently 2 years into my career and I recently decided to hire a financial advisor to help me make better investment decisions and to help with my overall finances. He was referred to me by a close friend of mine who really spoke highly of him. 

I’ve met with this guy twice and we’ve basically gone over my current budget and what type of investment accounts I should open given my current financial situation. He also works for a life insurance company called Primerica. That being said, at our first meeting he wanted to know if I currently have life insurance and if I was interested in getting a life insurance policy through his company. He was not pushing me to purchase a policy at all; I was actually interested given the low monthly cost that I would be paying. I assumed that I would have to pay monthly for his services but apparently he only makes money from the sales charge of the life insurance policy (not sure if I worded this correctly). When he broke this down to me he basically explained that he would make maybe $10 in commission from this sale which sounds like a good idea to me. However, seeing as how I’m un-married, no kids and no mortgage it’s likely that I don’t even need the life insurance.

I’m currently a federal employee so I am invested in TSP but my FA suggested that I open an outside retirement account just in case I decide to leave federal employment in the next few years. We have another meeting tomorrow where he will basically be setting up a retail brokerage account for me where I will be depositing about $100 per pay period into this account.  

Im pretty much a novice when it comes to finances and investment so I just wanted to get some tips/advice on what I should expect from a financial advisor. Based off of everything that I stated here, does he seem shady at all? I don’t get shady vibes from him at all but again, I don’t know too much about what I should or shouldn’t expect from a financial advisor. 

Any tips or words of advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,"Federal refund came in over $2,000 less than Turbotax projected","My federal refund was direct deposited today, and it was \~$2200 less than line 35a on my 1040. My state refund came in correctly as projected by Turbotax.

I called the IRS number, but no one was available to take my call.

One possible discrepancy is the $1400 stimulus. My income in 2020 was above the threshold for receiving a stimulus, and in 2021 was below the threshold. Because of this (I assume), I did not receive a stimulus payment in 2021, but apparently Turbotax thought I qualified and said that I would receive the $1400 in my refund. Is it correct that I qualified for the stimulus in 2021?

Even if I were not eligible for the stimulus, that still leaves a gap of over $800.

I checked all three credit reports and I have no delinquent payments or debts. No child support, child tax credit, alimony, or the like either.

Has this happened to anyone else this year? What is my recourse? Just wait for a letter of explanation from the IRS? Thank you!

For those who don't know what an Interest Rate Hike is,

&gt;When interest rates rise, it's usually good news for banking sector profits since they can earn more money on the dollars that they loan out.

My logic is, the bullish sentiment was simply buyers buying in before/during the Interest Rate Hike and expecting the stocks to increase for them to sell in a future date (aka a ""predicted dip""). Seeing that this is such a short-term move,  I assume it's caused by day traders and swing traders. I don't think that it was caused by any investors, as they tend to avoid timing the market unless they had some extra capital that they wanted to put into the dip.

I can afford my payments and have no issue paying, but my payments are slightly higher than I want to pay monthly and would rather save that money for better and more important things in my life.

The problem with HYG is that IBKR (brokers in general) charger borrow fee, and HYG has a borrow of \~4%, which is too high for bonds. When bonds absolutely crash they do so by \~10-15%.

$SJB is the daily short ETF (seeking -1 x $HYG return) has an expense ratio of 1%, which is OK. However, I would have to worry about decay: tracking daily return can lead to worse outcome over the long term. So if the ""crash"" is delayed, that wouldn't work.

CryptoMarkets,Biden Issues Long-Awaited Executive Order on Crypto,"The White House on Wednesday unveiled the key points of U.S. President Joe Biden’s planned executive order on crypto law. The order will recognize and regulate [digital assets](https://swapzone.io/currencies?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) in the country, and will also promote the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The order  will focus on protecting investors, mitigating illegal activities through crypto and also spur the development of digital payment systems.

The order marks the first time the U.S. government has addressed cryptocurrency law at a federal level.

The move comes amid growing focus on [cryptocurrencies](https://swapzone.io/currencies?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) from regulators, in wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Not only did the conflict mark the first time a country has officially sought crypto donations, but it also raised concerns over sanctioned entities possibly using crypto to bypass restrictions.

This is a major point in Biden’s planned order, which seeks to establish an international framework to reduce the risk posed by under-the-table transactions using digital assets.

When we had inflation this bad in the 70s, Chairman Volcker jacked rates as high as 10-20%. He curbed inflation quickly. We need serious action like that to curb inflation, not the insignificant 1% raises when inflation is soaring around 8%.

Volcker's actions did cause a short recession, but they were necessary to defeat prolonged inflation. If our Fed does not take similar actions, then inflation will be with us for the long haul, and regular people will be much worse off than they will if they have to deal with a short period of high rates.

Edit: I don't actually think we need 10% interest rates right now. Probably in the range of 4-5% higher than they are now would be good to combat the inflation we're seeing.",finance,1646921899.0
cybersecurity,Cyberattacks as a tool in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,"News number one in the world right now is the war in Ukraine. While the whole is watching how the two armies collide on Ukrainian territory, there is a parallel battlefield in the digital world. Cyberattacks are part of the conflict and a dangerous tool in any war in the modern-day era. 

## What cyber attacks have happened until now?

On the 23rd and 24th of February, several prominent media like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60500618), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-government-foreign-ministry-parliament-websites-down-2022-02-23/), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/russia-hacking-malware-cyberattack-virus-ukraine) reported that several cyberattacks hit Ukraine. The information came from the Ukrainian government itself and stated that internet users could not access the websites of various banks and government agencies, and institutions.

Mykhailo Fedorov, Digital Transformation Minister of the country, stated that a massive cyberattack began in Ukraine. Later it became clear that there was another level of aggression - malware with the data wiper. The Ukrainian government says that these latest attacks are “on a completely different level."" The UK and USA claim that the hack was Russian-backed. 

## External help for Ukraine

There are no allied armies in Ukraine but the country is not alone on the cyber front. The media “The Conversation” made a comprehensive [analysis](https://theconversation.com/russia-is-using-an-onslaught-of-cyber-attacks-to-undermine-ukraines-defence-capabilities-177638) of the cyberattacks. It mentioned that several countries from Europe had offered their assistance by providing the help of cybersecurity experts. The countries are: 

* Lithuania; 
* Netherlands; 
* Romania; 
* Estonia;
* Poland;
* Croatia. 

Besides them, others, like Australia, have stated that they will assist the Ukrainian Government. An unexpected ally has emerged on the front of cyber-warfare for Ukraine. In a Twitter statement, The famous group of hacker activists known as “Anonymous” [waged a cyberwar](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2022/hacking-group-anonymous-wages-cyber-war-against-russia/) on the Russian government. Some of the potential targets of the hackers could be the websites of: 

* Kremlin; 
* The Duma;
* The Ministry of Defence of Russia. 

However, this suggestion comes from the media Russia Today (RT), which is not considered by many a reliable source since it is a media controlled by the Russian state. Hacks took down websites of some municipalities in Russia and [showed Ukrainian President ](https://twitter.com/PucksReturn/status/1497203850717155341)Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s speech. Other websites were down only for a few hours. One of them was the website of Russia Today. 

However, several ransomware groups stated that they would back the Russian side.  

## Other countries have to be ready

Several days ago there was a widespread warning that other countries and organizations must prepare for cyberattacks. For our country Bulgaria, as a result of this, on Sunday (27th of February), the Bulgarian Ministry of e-Government driven by Bozhidar Bozhanov took action to secure electronic systems.

Experts from the Ministry of e-Government of Bulgaria and the Cybercrime Department of the CDCOC at the Ministry of Interior took action to ensure the country’s cybersecurity. 

In the context of the escalation of hybrid attacks, they acted to filter traffic from over 45,000 suspicious Internet addresses. There had been attempts to interfere with electronic systems or networks from all these addresses.  

We will follow the situation and keep you posted on the latest cybersecurity development with the ongoing conflict. . If you want to learn more about strengthening your cybersecurity, check our blog.

ROI,Neoliberalism and it's connection to Donbas Today,"Hi all,

So, a lot of the discussion on this sub seems to be focused on issues post 2013 such as whether Euro-maiden was a coup or a revolution or whether Ukraine should join NATO/EU. I thought to make a post highlighting one factor that I think it is not discussed enough: **The effect of Neo-liberal policies (mass privatization and deregulation) in post soviet-states and it’s connection to the current crisis.**

I should preface this by saying; I’m not a historian. This is a topic I’ve been reading about for the past while. I couldn’t find a single article that encapsulates this whole argument, which is why I decided to make this post. If I make a mistake, please correct me.

**Shock Therapy**

After the fall of the of the Berlin wall and the subsequent collapse of USSR rule and influence, former Soviet republics such as Ukraine and Russia went through a dramatic economic transformation. Mikhail Gorbachev had hoped to transition Russia from a centrally planned, state capitalist economy into a social democrat one, but failed. Instead, nearly every state in eastern Europe that was recently under the soviet sphere of influence went through *Shock Therapy*. This is a term I am sure many of you are familiar with.  

Popularized by Naomi Klein in her book *The Shock Doctrine* (Documentary if you don’t have the time: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3B5qt6gsxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3B5qt6gsxY)),Shock Therapy is the process of ramming free-market policies down the throats of nation states that had once resisted. These policies include dropping price/currency controls, mass privatization, dropping any trade protection measures and the withdrawal of state subsidies. This in turn, lead to capital flowing out of the former eastern aligned states. In every single one of these countries, inequality grew.  

One important thing to note here, is that in the west, we **never** implement the policies that we push on developing countries on ourselves. Every major power today grew out of protectionism (Japan, the US, South Korea etc). The west would never let capital flow out, only in. Some states recovered (Czech Republic, Poland).For others, shock therapy had devastating effects, with both Russia and Ukraine’s mortality growing hugely.  

But, perhaps most importantly to contemporary times, this environment was the perfect breeding ground for oligarchs to seize natural resources and become some of the wealthiest people in the world. This is true of Ukraine as it is of Russia. Of course, the oligarchs shaped the future history of both states. Putin is just a cog in the machine of rich men who will do anything to consolidate mass wealth and protect it through silencing, intimidation and violence.

**The Donbas Region**  

The self-determination movements of Donetsk and the Luhansk oblast are of particular interest to me. They differ from the Catalans in Spain or the Kurds in the middle east, as their quest for self-determination is far less mature. Throughout the Russian civil war the majority of Donbas Region threw their support behind Nestor Makhno, an anarchist who fought both the red and white army. Throughout Stalin’s rule the Donbas region suffered the most from famine. During the soviet period, the Donbas went through a period of Russification. But despite being majority ethnic Russian, the Donbas never held the same level of affinity with the Russian republic as the Irish in Northern Ireland did with the Irish Republic. There were groups who supported joining the Russian Republic (and against Ukranian independence) but they were in the minority.

As the U.S.S.R collapsed, 83.9% of voters in Donetsk and 83.6% in Luhansk supported Ukranian independence in a 1991 referendum. The shock therapy which engulfed much of eastern Europe hit the Donbas region pretty hard. Donbas had been the home to industry for a long time with a strong employment rate. The following neoliberal policies brought average wages down by 80%. Alike to Russia, Ukrainian politics was riddled with corruption and criminal endeavors. 

This, in turn, created a huge amount of discontent for the government in Kyiv, with mass strikes amongst miners.  Taken from Wikipedia: 

&gt;*One strike leader said that Donbas people had voted for independence because they wanted ""power to be given to the localities, enterprises, cities"", not because they wanted heavily centralised power moved from ""Moscow to Kyiv""*

**The Proletariat and The War**

The people of Donetsk and Luhansk have been used as pawns by capitalists for their own capitalistic interests and by extension, imperialistic ambitions. It is easy for us in the west to view these wars as the battle of brutish thugs, with Neo-Nazis on both side. But I think we must remember that both the proletariat of Ukraine and Russia are victims to consequences of neoliberalism. As socialists we must condemn Putin, we must condemn neoliberalism and we must practice internationalism/solidarity amongst all peoples, regardless of race, language nor creed.

&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by at least a 25 basis points next week. And if inflation stays high, the Fed is “prepared to raise by more than that” in the coming months, Chair Jerome Powell said last week.  
&gt;  
&gt;That would be a mistake. After next week’s hike, the Fed should hit pause for at least the next several months and possibly through the summer — even though the war in Ukraine will no doubt make inflation worse in the U.S.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s unclear how bad the conflict will get, the effect it will have on the region and whether it will lead to a global recession this year. The probability of that last is less than the most extreme predictions, but is nonetheless real.  
&gt;  
&gt;A more aggressive Fed might use a recession as an opportunity to rapidly bring down inflation by sticking to its rate-hike schedule. That is risky policy, and one that [Powell seems disinclined to take](https://archive.ph/ybhBA). If a recession hit, it’s likely that the Fed would simply have to reverse any rate hikes it had made in the preceding months.  
&gt;  
&gt;A see-saw pattern in rates would weaken the overall impact of the Fed’s policy. Consider, for example, the plight of a homebuilder who cuts production next summer in response to rising rates. She is not likely to increase production immediately if rates fall in December; she’d want to wait for a signal that rates will remain low for a while. From the Fed’s perspective, it would be more effective to leave rates alone, encouraging her to keep production high for the next several months.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are also risks to consider beyond outright recession. The direct costs of higher energy and food prices will cut into consumer savings. Even more important, spiking commodity prices are likely to dent consumer confidence, leading to reduced spending on other items.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another consideration is the effect of the war on developing markets around the world. Higher food and energy prices will hit their economies harder. Global uncertainty will lead investors to move funds out their markets and into the U.S. That could cause a drop in the demand for U.S. exports, which are geared toward investment goods such as heavy machinery. That would reproduce some of the effects of the mini-recession that swept the Midwest in 2015 and 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the same time, money flowing into the U.S. from both developing markets and Western Europe will cause the dollar to rise and the relative prices of imports to fall. As consumer spending shifts toward imports, that will cool some of the underlying inflationary pressures in the U.S.  
&gt;  
&gt;The near-term environment is complex. It’s unclear how long the war will last and how far-reaching its effects will be. The ideal Fed response, however, is straightforward: **Go ahead with the rate hike next week. But make it clear that there won’t be any more for at least two more meetings, and then only as the fallout from the war in Ukraine becomes more certain.**",finance,1646937112.0

Bitcoin,A thought experiment for hyperbitcoinization,"TLDR: Bitcoin will take over the world because in its final form, no rational actor would hold fiat over BTC.

In this post, I lay out a thought experiment to explain why Bitcoin will become the only significant form of money in the free world. For now I only compare Bitcoin to fiat; I will do a follow-up comparing Bitcoin to other cryptos.

Imagine there is a non-fiat form of money called BestCoin (no relation to the shitcoin of the same name) that has the following properties:

1. It appreciates in value (deflationary) 1-3% per year
2. Low volatility (yearly high and yearly low differs by no more than 5%)
3. Completely (and unquestionably) legal and uncensorable
4. Accepted by every merchant, including the government, anywhere in the free world
5. Money transfers/payments happen instantly with very little to no fees
6. Low risk of loss/theft/collapse

Let us compare this to the typical fiat currency:

1. Almost always depreciates in value year-over-year
2. Volatility is typically low, but can occasionally become massive to the downside (as we see in current events with geopolitics and high inflation)
3. Is legal, but assets can be frozen/sanctioned/confiscated even without being charged of a crime
4. Only accepted by merchants in the same country or currency zone
5. Transfer between institutions can take days, or even weeks for cross-border transfers
6. You won’t lose your life’s savings due to theft or robbery, but macro-level wealth debasement occasionally happens (via banks, fiscal/monetary policy)

Comparing these properties, why would any rational actor choose to hold any significant amount of their wealth in fiat currency rather than BestCoin? They wouldn’t; they would hold all their liquid savings in BestCoin. BestCoin would become the only significant form of money, similar to how gold was during the Gold Standard era.

I will now argue that while Bitcoin does not currently have the properties of BestCoin, it is well on its way to getting them. I address each property in turn:

1. Bitcoin’s halving cycle every 4 years ensures that by 2032, Bitcoin’s supply will have negligible increases (&lt; 0.25%). Because GDP/wealth tends to grow by more than that over time, Bitcoin’s value will still appreciate (even without new adoption or speculation) because the same amount of coins represents more wealth.
2. Bitcoin is currently in its speculative phase, so a lot of volatility is inevitable (especially for the price to go up). Its volatility has decreased over time, and once Bitcoin achieves mass adoption, its volatility will be much lower as it takes massive capital to move the price, and much of the capital will already be held in Bitcoin.
3. Some local and national governments have already announced that they are, or are planning to, make Bitcoin legal tender. Because it is in every individual’s best interest to hold Bitcoin, we expect democracies to adopt Bitcoin (or at least not try to ban it) by voter preference. Even somewhat authoritarian countries might adopt Bitcoin (ex. El Salvador) for reasons I might elaborate on in a separate post.
4. Corporations and payment platforms are already beginning to allow Bitcoin payments. It is only a matter of time before all merchants do. Even if a merchant/government doesn’t accept Bitcoin, immediately converting BTC to and from fiat is already possible in many payment platforms.
5. Second layer solutions like Lightning Network are allowing fast and cheap transfers. It’s still new but will mature over time. For large payments, the settlement time of 1 hour is still better than days.
6. Bitcoin’s monetary policy makes hyperinflation impossible, and decentralization ensures those policies will never change. Physical robbery ($5 wrench attack) and poor security problems (losing your keys, or keys getting stolen) can be solved through education and better technology for self-custody or by regulated/openly-auditable custodial solutions for those who prefer it.

The market share of BestCoin would be around $100 trillion (the current wealth stored in global broad money supply). If you accept that Bitcoin has even a 5% chance of achieving the properties of BestCoin within a few decades, then the rational decision is to accept significant volatility now in order to reap the rewards of Bitcoin transitioning into BestCoin, making each Bitcoin worth $5 million.

solar,What Are Dealer Loan Fees? (US Focus on buying solar),"If a solar company comes to you and says they have a 1.99% loan or a 0.99% loan (or for that matter, any loan that is lower than about 6%-7%).  There will be dealer fees buried in their price. IF they have not built the dealer fees in, then they are eating the cost of the financing.

Why? Well money costs something. It costs a lot more than what a 0.99% loan will yield. To get people to invest money to a solar finance company, the solar finance company has to promise a decent return to their lenders. If they don't then the guy with the money is going to go find some other investment.  On top of that, the finance company also has to make enough money to cover their operations and pay their people.

Every solar finance company I've worked with (at least three now) has had fees ranging from 7-25% depending on the loan rate and term (lower rates, higher fees). The reason you don't know what those fee are is because the lender typically forbids us from disclosing them. They, in fact, make us sign an NDA. 

Their fees are set based on profit requirements and risk, (Higher risk, higher fees) competition, market forces etc.  Did you ever wonder why some organizations can give cheap loans with no fees? Typically it's because the loan is guaranteed by someone else. So if the buyer defaults, there is no risk to the bank (Our state has an energy efficiency loan program backed by dollars collected by the investor owned utilities - you can borrow up to $25K no interest, no fees for 7 years! The bank is happy to give these loans out because if the homeowner defaults, the utility pays it.) 

Imagine the fee for a particular loan is 10%. Calculating the new price is relatively straight forward. The selling price is the price the installer wants to sell the system divided by 1-the loan fee percent.   So If I want to sell a $20K system with a 10% fee, my selling price is 20K/(1-0.1) = $22,222. That way, the installer gets the margin he needs and the bank gets paid. (the bank is taking 10% of the final price!)

When properly included, the fees increase the price of the project. But imagine you have an installer with what appears to be a really competitive price and a low interest rate.  The installer still has to make a profit and if they have to pay the bank, then they take cost out of other places. For example, unskilled labor, sloppy installations, poor customer service (short and long term) and so on. 

And if the dealer is not charging the fees, then there's a pretty good chance they aren't going to last because the fees are a serious drain on margin.

What should you do?   There was a time when fees were relatively low and the combination of net metering and incentives made the loan a no-brainier. Those days are largely gone. Like many posters here, I always recommend home equity if you've got it. At least you can deduct the interest costs. Yes the rate won't be one of those teaser 0.99% rates but it will be pretty low and there are no fees. 

The next time you get a solar quote, ask for a cash price. Some installers might be straight with you and give you a price without fees but that NDA (mentioned above) may tie their hands a bit. Because if they do give you a 10% discount for cash on a product with a 10% loan fee, they are, in effect, revealing the fees they are not supposed to discuss.

And...

In the world of Energy Sage (where you can get 5 -10 quotes in a day), price competition is fierce. Bank fees will knock you out of the game really quickly. To compete nowadays, you have to do more systems (faster, subcontractors etc) because while you can't make enough margin on one job, you can ""make it up in volume.""  But faster means potential quality issues. This is why I hate ES. It is facilitating a race to the bottom and or consolidation to only big (high volume) players. 

""Profit"" is not a dirty word. It's a fact of life. Every business has to profit. For my business, we need profits to keep our people employed during the winter slow season (weather really messes up installation schedules). My company, just like the bank, has owners (investors). They could put their money elsewhere and then I wouldn't get to install solar at all.  Some business owners are greedy sure. But I promise you, if I wanted to make a lot of money, I would NOT be in the solar installation business.",energy,1646945290.0
personalfinance,Vanguard - Invest from Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund or directly from checking account,"I tried but failed to find an answer in Vanguard's help section before posting:

I recently opened a Vanguard account and plan to invest in mutual funds only. I transferred some cash to begin with and this went into my default 'Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund'. I used these funds for my first transaction. 

It appears that when I submit a trade I could instead choose my linked checking account as the payment source. Is there any downside to using my checking account as payment source? For instance, if I had $0 in my Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund and decided to buy, say, $5k of VTSAX using my checking account would there be a delay in processing the transaction while the funds were transferring? I don't know what I don't know and any insight (or any other downsides or considerations) is appreciated!",finance,1646945481.0

personalfinance,Do we need to hire someone? Or is this something I should know how to do?,"My parents were extremely “hands off” with their finances. Despite them doing very well for themselves, I think that its more important to be involved with how our money is managed. My parents very happily paid someone else to do it for them. As such, We’ve received very little financial advice from anyone in our situation. I lost my dad two months ago due to cancer complications and it’s dawned on my that we don’t have many people we can confide in anymore to advise us.

My wife is a physician coming out of residency, I am just out of my PhD and am entering the biotech industry. 

Our gross total income will increase from $85k to about $290k later this year, and based on my wife’s agreement with her practice, our gross income will be &gt;$500k in two year’s time. 

My wife has $375k in federal school loans, with about $16k of discrete interest that has accrued during residency. Our understanding is that it is added to the principal when her residency ends. The loans have not yet been consolidated, so she’s got some that are like 7% interest and some that are much lower.

We have two Roth IRA’s that we’ve both managed to build up to about 6k apiece. 

We have $224k left on our mortgage, but will sell for at least a $50-75k profit toward our down payment when we move in June.

We have a 7 month old daughter. 

We have $15k in savings, which we figure is about a 6 month emergency fund.

We’ve both trained for a long time, and we’ve grown accustomed to our finances being very simple. Pay these bills, pay the mortgage, top off the emergency fund, dump the rest into the IRA’s, which we were never able to max out.

Now it’s a touch more complicated, and while I have a little bit of time to learn, we have made some mistakes. For example, we didn’t know for like the first 6 months of adding to our Vanguard IRAs that we had to actually go in and BUY things, it was just sitting there as cash. We’re a bit more savvy now, but I really don’t want to screw up our future, and we already start a little bit behind so we must play catch up.

I think we obviously want to pay down her loans as aggressively as possible, and refinancing them comes with special considerations. 

I’m fairly certain setting up a 529 plan for our daughter is the best way to go.

If left to my own devices, I would probably just take the vast remainder of our income after all bills are paid and put it in a target retirement date vanguard fund, leaving ~5% to make speculative investments.

I don’t have a measure of how complex our situation is. My wife doesn’t have the time nor the desire to learn how to do this on our own, and I’m sort of trying to understand if this is something I can handle on my own or if we should just fork over 1% earnings and hire someone. I also understand that we could pay to sit down with someone once to come up with a plan. 

Does anyone have any advice here?",finance,1646951905.0

I understand that when the fed raises interest rates, the value of existing individual bonds go down. What about bond funds like BIV and BLV from Vanguard? It seems like they should initially go down as well, since the value of everything they own would go down... but would they tend to naturally recover because they can get higher interest rates for cheaper?

Bitcoincash,We are all Satoshi...,"Legend of the hummingbird :                             One day a fire broke out in a forest - a huge woodlands was suddenly engulfed by a raging
wild fire. Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest. As they came to the
edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and
powerless. They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought
there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird.
This particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked
up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the
stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals
watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, ""Don't bother,
it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it’s only a drop, you
can't put out this fire.""
And as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird’s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless
and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a
mocking voice, ""What do you think you are doing?"" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or
losing a beat, looked back and said, ""I am doing what I can.""

economy,5 Reasons why RECESSION IS COMING in 2022,"Recessions are a natural part of economic growth. The last big one was 14 years ago and it's only a matter of time before the next one comes along. These are 5 indicators of upcoming significant economic downturn in 2022:

**High inflation:**  
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has today announced the highest inflation in 40 years at 7.9%. Jump does not include recent oil price spike, which would make inflation even higher. As we can see from history, a high rise of inflation is often followed by a recession. Not to mention Europe, where the inflation situation is much worse because of the Russian invasion.

**US Treasury Yield Curve was inverted:**

The US Treasury Yield Curve is considered as one of best recession indicators. It was recently inverted, meaning short term interest rates were higher than long term rates. This unusual occurrence has historically been a very reliable indicator of an upcoming recession as it reflects investor sentiment about future economic performance. Since WW2 every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession in the following 6-18 months, and recessions are naturally correlated with decreased stock market returns.

**Big crude oil price increase:**

In the past 50 years, every time oil prices, adjusted for inflation, rose 50% above trend, a recession followed. The international gauge for prices climbed well above $110 a barrel this week, crossing that threshold on worries about disruption to Russia’s exports after the country invaded Ukraine.

**Low unemployment rate:**

Low unemployment is like the calm before a storm. The U.S. economy has never managed to sustain a low rate of unemployment without tipping into a recession. Unemployment rates reach their lowest point around 12 months before a recession starts. Unemployment has been low in recent years, currently 3.8%. But it's not actually unemployment that predicts recessions. It's credit growth that is related to unemployment. In short: The lower unemployment, the more credit growth, the more likely a recession will follow.

**Above average growth of the S&amp;P 500 index in recent years:**

Economic growth always leads to recession. That is how the economy works. We can see this in the S&amp;P 500. For example, before the 2001 recession, the S&amp;P 500 index rose nearly 50% in 2 years. Such a large increases preceded all recessions. We can observe that from March 2020 the scenario repeats itself.

CryptoCurrency,My Review of Outlet Finance's Crypto Savings Account,"I heard about the Outlet Finance App which promises 9% interest as a saving account alternative. So I downloaded it an looked at all their disclosures to see how they could offer such a high interest rate just to deposit cash.

**Let’s start out by talking about what Outlet Finance ISN’T**

• It’s not a bank

• It’s not a savings account or even a high yield savings account (at least not a traditional one)

• It is not backed by the FDIC

• It’s not risk-free, there is the potential to lose your money

**So, what is it?**

• While Outlet Finance is not bank, it does operate similarly to one, but in the cryptocurrency space. A traditional bank operates by lending out the money from your account and pays you a portion of the interest that is paid by the borrower. Outlet Finance does the same thing, but with crypto and this means the interest rate you get paid is significantly higher.

Here's a good blog post by Outlet explaining how the lending process works [https://intercom.help/outlet-finance/en/articles/4357774-how-outlet-works](https://intercom.help/outlet-finance/en/articles/4357774-how-outlet-works)

**Pros**

• The 9% APY is by far the largest positive, at almost double digit returns Outlet is competitive with the stock markets historical returns

• Although the interest in generated by cryptocurrency lending, you don’t need a deep understanding of crypto to make money. You don’t need a wallet, nor do you have to deal with any exchanges, or monitoring the price of various coins, your return is about as passive as it gets

• The risks do seem to be largely mitigated through overcollateralization and smart contracts

**Cons**

• While the risks are small, they aren’t zero. Cryptocurrency and smart contracts are still a relatively new and developing technology. The safeguards in place have not been tested and while they work in theory, moving from theory to practice is an entirely different animal.

• Aside from the risks of developing technology, Outlet Finance is not FDIC insured. So, if the company goes under or there is a “run on the bank” and your money is gone, you’re out of luck at that point. No one is going to step in and reimburse your lost money

• These extremely high interest rates are not going to last forever, as crypto becomes more mainstream and more widely accepted as an alternative to the dollar. The cost of money will go down and loans will become less expensive. When that happens the returns from crypto lending platforms like Outlet will also go down. This is a small downside and isn’t strictly limited to Outlet Finance, but it’s important to know that this won’t be the Golden Goose forever

**Verdict**

Let’s again start with who shouldn’t invest with Outlet Finance. If you’re looking for a place to put your emergency fund so it earns a bit more interest, you shouldn’t look at Outlet Finance or any form of investment. Your emergency fund needs to be accessible and not exposed to any risk (yes, I understand the effects of inflation), but inflation doesn’t have the risk of making your emergency fund go to zero overnight. Do I think that’ll happen with Outlet Finance, no I don’t, but at the same time that risk while small, does exist.

**Now who is Outlet Finance a good fit for?**

If you want to take advantage of the returns that are possible with crypto without having to deal with lending out coins yourself, Outlet provides a good medium to handle all the groundwork and you still take advantage of the high returns. It offers a great way to diversify your investments into something that is basically just as passive as investing in ETF.

1: Consumer protection:
good news here for us. More inspection over crypto exchanges and projects, anti fraud protection and some kind of federal insurance for investors might be on the table.










2. Financial stability:
Bad news, kinda. When they talk about stability they mean market can't be stable when everyone can mint their own currency. And by that they mean stablecoins. Incoming hard regulations on stablecoins are expected. 











3. illicit activity:
More bad news. Illicit activity is another name for money laundering, tax evasion, funding of dangerous organizations and bypassing sanctions, you get the idea. Say goodbye to permissionless trading. Mandatory KYC incoming.












4. U.S. competitiveness:
Might be extremely dangerous. My take is the official start of the long loathed US CBDC or digital dollar. And the worst part is feds trying to seize control over the whole cryptomarket by making it mandatory for crypto exchanges to us CBDC.













5. Financial inclusion:
Another potential good news. Can massively help mass adoption or at least make crypto more mainstream and available.
Can even mean trading cryptos at stock markets and banks.













6.responsible innovation:
This can mean many things. From implementing design ethics and such to other areas like impact of cryptocurrencies on environment. Not sure if it is bad or good but get ready for any coin with huge carbon footprint to get hit hard by regulations.

personalfinance,"I overestimated how much I would earn in 2021, ended up earning a little more than the federal poverty level and didn't update my earnings in the Health Marketplace. Am I in trouble?","Hello!

I'm not sure if this is the best place to put this but I'm not sure what to do. 

I'm not good at estimating and I am perhaps a little too optimistic. Well, I had a little too much optimism in how much I would be earning in 2021 when I applied to the Marketplace for health insurance (I estimated about $27,000) because of the job I had. I ended up leaving that job nearly halfway in the year and believed I would be making enough income through self-employment to maintain my estimate.

That didn't happen.

I don't have any excuses other then that I was not able to make the $27,000 I had estimated and actually made only $15,000..

Based of the amount I actually made, I qualified for Medicaid in my state (Missouri). I, being optimistic about my finances, continued with the same tax credit I had received for my estimated income for the rest of the 2021 year and did not get on Medicaid or change my estimated income.

My question is will I be penalized for this? Will I have to make a payment to the IRS for overestimating how much I thought I would earn when I earned enough to be just barely above the federal poverty level?

Any help of any kind is greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!

TLDR: I earned less then I had hoped and should have updated my income after leaving the job, but didn't. I qualified for medicaid but stayed on my pre-unemployed plan, will I get in trouble?",finance,1646971133.0

personalfinance,Is it ever advisable to forgo my w-4 withholdings (at least federal) to pay down debt?,"So, in short, due to a series of complicated situations over the last year, I amassed a pretty hefty bit of credit card debt (of around $22k). I had a plan in place to pay it down aggressively and get out from under it by the end of the year/early next year (I earn $60k a year, low cost of living area, rent and utilities is about $900/mo).

Throwing a bit of a wrench in the plan, my car decided to up and die on me, so now it is significantly more difficult to pay off that debt, considering a ~$400/mo car payment. So one thing I am considering is withdrawing my w-4 withholding from now through July, which would give me around another $1,400 a month to pay down debt, which would go pretty fatally things considered. I am mostly considering keeping my state withholding but opting out of a federal withholding.

Now, I don't think this is a normally advisible plan, but given the circumstances and the interest rates in those cards, it kind of seems like a smartish thing to do.

My tax burden for the year should end up around 6k after accounting for the standard deduction and such, I already have a little over $2k of that down from these first few months, and the last 3 months of the year would result in about the same... meaning I'd be left with around a 1.5k tax burden come tax time (which I should have saved pretty easily through January, Feb, and March of next year.

While this is kind of risky, I do have some safety nets through my family luckily. My family ran into a medium sized inheritance, and while it is currently being cleared through probate, and despite not being explicitly listed on any of the major assets, my parents have expressed they are willing to help out a little if needed. While I am trying to avoid that by any means necessary, and most of the assets wouldn't have cleared/been liquidated until late summer, if anything were to happen come tax time (such as being fired between January and March) I would have a safety net available to use.

personalfinance,"Buy a residence now, or is there any reason to wait to see what happens with rates?","I need a sounding board.  

My wife and I are just about retirement age. We just moved from Texas and are renting an apartment here in south Florida. I can't believe how much of a meme my life is now. I'm still working remotely and its been really nice being here. 

Anyway, rent's have gone up something like 27% from one account I saw recently, residences have also increased in purchase price significantly.  Looking at price history on Zillow and you will see a hockey stick increase in the last two years.  So, prices going up on rent, and to own. It feels like every day we're slipping backwards. Finding a decent rental is tough.  I think if I can afford it it would be better to own right now to get cash out of the bank and into property so its not getting eat up by inflation.

My wife wants to settle here. She likes the climate, etc. but I feel its pricey, but I'm going to try and accommodate her wishes for some stability in owning a residence for a number of reasons.

She wants something walkable (within 30 minutes)  to the beach. For my budget that means condo. I'm not crazy about the idea of a condo, with the expensive HOAs I've seen, and the interview process with condo association, etc. but that is kind of the lifestyle my wife wants, so I will try to make it happen for her.  

I have cash for 20% down on a 350k place. bank rate mtg calc puts us all in at about $2100 for that. More than I would like to spend, but can afford it.  A 2/2 would be fine for us.  I have a decent 401k, stocks, and real estate investments, plus a small military reserve retirement pay so we're good there for now, assuming the market doesn't take a huge dump. 

I'm trying to figure out, if I should buy now, or wait and see what happens with interest rates.  I've heard interest rates are going up. And if they go up a lot, then its possible residential prices might come down. But I don't really want to wait, I'd rather get what I can while I can afford it, while I am still working and can get a mortgage, while interest rates are still somewhat affordable. And if prices fall, well it won't matter because I'll be making my payment no matter what anyway, I don't think rents will get any lower.  I think it's time to buy. 

Would there be any reason in your mind why I should wait. Or, maybe reduce the purchase price down to high 200s instead of going all in at 350-400 in case of some risk, market crash, job loss, etc.?",finance,1646980354.0

stocks,Holding TQQQ/TECL and UCO longterm?,"I understand the conventional wisdom is levered ETF/Ns are not buy and hold investments because they aim for 2 or 3x returns on any given day and rebalance, and that after daily rebalancing losses can compound greatly over a short period resulting in loss of most capital.

TECL top holdings include about 50% AAPL/MSFT/NVDA/V/MA—all great companies IMO. 

My general investment thesis is that there might be some contraction in Growth as the Fed tightens but tech is obviously not going anywhere, and inflationary concerns should be hedged by commodity exposure, and beyond Ukraine I expect oil to surpass 2008 peaks, and lastly rents will rise faster than inflation and real estate exposure such as with Blackstone (BX) is a good idea. 

I’m thinking of buying 50% TECL and 50% ECO and funneling profits into BX with any 20% rise. I’m hoping any losses in one (TECL or UCO) would be mostly offset by gains in the other. 

Questions:

1. I know losses can compound quickly with leveraged ETFs but can’t gains also compound rapidly? Is the risk-reward profile negatively screwed towards losses somehow?
2. Are there any other major risks I don’t understand?
3. The biggest risk I see is oil and equiies both collapse and the funds loose so much they can’t recover. Would leveraged gold (UGL) or vix help offset? Any other ideas? 
4. Could you please comment on my tentative strategy of holding just TECL and UCO, and if profitable buying BX?

**Investment Highlights - Acquisition of Curiosity Ink Media**

The company purchased Curiosity Ink Media (CIM) in August 2021. CIM is a creator, developer, and producer of kids and family entertainment content that was created by Russell Hicks in 2018. We believe the company is poised to benefit from the increase in expected spending on content from major streaming services.

**Russell Hicks has a history of success and was involved in the development of hits such as Scooby-Doo, SpongeBob Square Pants, Dora the Explorer, and Paw Patrol.**

He was a driving force behind the success of Nickelodeon in the early 2000s, where he was the president of content and production from 2012–2017 and Chief Creative Officer from 1998-2012. We believe his past history of developing hit content is repeatable.

The team at CIM has a strong incentive to develop successful content due to the earn-out structure from the acquisition. Grom paid roughly $5.7M for CIM up front, but the selling party has the opportunity to earn up to $17.5M more upon achieving certain EBITDA targets from 2023-2025.

According to [Ampere Research](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/streaming-services-help-push-content-spending-past-220b-2021), streaming services spent more than $220B for content in 2021, representing an increase of 14% over 2020. In 2022, Ampere expects investment for content to exceed $230B, representing an increase of 4.5%

**Top Draw Animation Tailwinds**

With recent contract wins in 4Q21, we believe the company’s backlog is roughly $8.6M, which represents a 33% increase above the backlog stated at the beginning of FY21 and a 23% increase above the backlog stated at the beginning of FY20.

[Russell Hicks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-hicks-8358b34/) was appointed to Managing Director of Top Draw Animation in August 2021. The founder of Top Draw Animation, Wayne Dearing, resided in the Philippines and retired in August 2021. **The company now has direct access to Hollywood through the connections that Russell Hicks has built over the past 40 years.**

According to **former Nickelodeon executive, Paul Ward**, who joined the company in March 2021 as **President of Grom**, many of Russell Hicks’ colleagues hold key decision-making roles at major companies such as **NBC Universal, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon.**

As a result, we believe the company’s Top Draw Animation business will win a lot of new contracts going forward.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FIZ3gi5KR4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FIZ3gi5KR4)

&amp;#x200B;

Like I thought I was making bank with the staking coins I have now, and while the staking or defi payout is much higher than 5% (last I checked stable coins get no where near this, and the bulk of my stuff isn't stable coins). There is real risk in this where with fiat there isn't any. It is federally protected, the $ will be worth a $ always, and to be blunt. At a 5% this is slightly above average inflation. 

Which means if you had a million $ and you got 5%. You would be getting $50k a year in your savings account. No wonder why the people back them seemed like they were on the top of the world. It wasn't that half of them were coked out of their mind. They could afford stuff and they thought their rainy day fund will grow by itself.

financialindependence,Paying off a mortgage early?,"I have an opinion on this but want to make sure I’m not crazy on this. 

I’m a 27m who purchased my first house in November. $480k purchase price. 7% down and have $430ish left on a 30 year mortgage with a 3.4% interest rate. 

My partner (who I’m engaged to and will be marrying next year) and I have a combined income around 320-330k annually to set our financial context. We work in industries that will probably not have a downturn for the next 15-20 years so no worries about loss of income. Even if our specific companies go through cuts we will be able to easily replace that in other roles. 

I’ve seen so many posts and videos about paying off your mortgage as soon as possible to get “debt free”. With our low interest rate, and the current rate of inflation devaluing that mortgage, wouldn’t it be better to continue to invest extra income in other areas (stocks, 401k, IRA, additional properties) vs dumping it into extra principal payments? My parents of course recommend paying off our home ASAP but they’re not super financially educated. 

Thoughts? I know there’s a mental aspect of not having any debt whatsoever but I’m the type of person that is okay knowing we have a mortgage while investing otherwise. Thoughts?",finance,1647006701.0
personalfinance,Help with percentages on loan,"For some reason I can't wrap my head around this calculation. I have a loan for $2,500 with an interest rate of 9.25%. I've been paying $200 a month on it. I just got an offer from my bank for a balance transfer that's going to charge me a 4% fee and no interest for one year. I did the math for what the 4% would be but doing the math for the 9.25% is throwing me off because it's charged monthly.

## ‘Most advanced’ China-linked backdoor ever raises alarms for cyber-espionage investigators

A backdoor in use as recently as November 2021 is the “most advanced piece of malware” ever seen from China-linked spies, according to researchers at Symantec. Dubbed Daxin, the malware forms part of “a long-running espionage campaign against select governments and other critical infrastructure targets,” most of them being of strategic interest to China. The malware “appears to be optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the attackers to burrow deep into a target’s network and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions,” the researchers said. Dick O’Brien, principal editor for the Symantec Threat Intelligence Team, told CyberScoop that for China-linked malware, this is “on another level.”([Cyberscoop](https://www.cyberscoop.com/daxin-china-linked-symantec-cyber-espionage/))

## Hackers allegedly leak Samsung data, source code

Less than a week after releasing a 20GB document archive from 1TB of data stolen from Nvidia, the Lapsus$ data extortion group on Friday leaked a huge collection of confidential data they claim to be from Samsung Electronics. The leak apparently contains “confidential Samsung source code” for every Trusted Applet (TA) installed in Samsung’s TrustZone environment used for sensitive operations (e.g. hardware cryptography, binary encryption, access control), as well as algorithms for biometric unlock operations, bootloader source code for all recent Samsung devices, confidential source code from Qualcomm, source code for Samsung’s activation servers, and full source code for technology used for authorizing and authenticating Samsung accounts, including APIs and services. This is according to Bleeping Computer, who also state that if these details are accurate, Samsung has suffered a major data breach that could cause huge damage to the company.([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-190gb-of-alleged-samsung-data-source-code/))

## Russia says it’s okay to download a car

Faced with many technology companies no longer providing software and services in the country, Russian officials are drafting rules that would establish a “unilateral” software licensing mechanism, effectively renewing expired software licenses without consent of the owners of the IP. This would only apply if the copyright holder resides in a country with sanctions against Russia, and there are no viable Russian alternatives. The  Civil Code of the Russian Federation already allows for this practice under specific circumstances, provided that patent holders are notified and a reasonable fee is paid. The proposed amendment to the Civil Code would forgo payment while sanctions are in place. Russia says copyright infringement is still illegal and prosecuted in the country. ([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/piracy-ok-russia-to-ease-software-licensing-rules-after-sanctions/))

## DDoS attacks use new record-breaking amplification vector

A new DDoS method, called “reflection,” is being used in attacks that provide a record-breaking amplification ratio of almost 4.3 billion to 1. Reflection attacks start with a small packet which gets reflected inside a closed network, amplifying its size to near maximum capacity, before channeling the traffic to the target. Threat actors were observed using the new DDoS technique on victims across numerous industries in mid-February by abusing a vulnerable Mitel driver found in devices using the TP-240 VoIP interface. Customers using vulnerable devices should follow Mitel’s remediation instructions, enforcing firewall rules to block malicious initiator packets or disable the abused command.([Bleeping Computers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ddos-attacks-now-use-new-record-breaking-amplification-vector/))

## 2022 password report bad news for Cincinnati Reds fans (and pretty much everyone else)

The 2022 Weak Password Report from Specops takes a look at both the human side and the tech side of why passwords are the weakest link in an organization’s network. The report analyzed 800 million breached passwords and highlighted that 93% of the passwords used in brute force attacks include 8 or more characters and 68% of passwords used in attacks include at least two character types. More than half of organizations do not use password management tools while nearly half of organizations do not have user verification in place for calls to the IT service desk. Interestingly, the Cincinnati Reds top the list of most popular baseball teams found in compromised password lists. The report recommends that organizations block weak and compromised passwords, enforce password length requirements, verify user identities at the service desk and audit their environment for password-related vulnerabilities.([Specops](https://specopssoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Specops-Software-Weak-Password-Report-2022-2.pdf))

## Twitter Tor service launches

Twitter has been tough to access in Russia, with the government blocking access earlier this month and most VPNs compelled to also block the site. In response, security researcher Alec Muffett announced a new Tor Project onion service for Twitter. This will allow users in Russia to access the service through the Tor browser even when blocked by their ISP. ISPs can still block access to the overall Tor network, although users can often connect through use of a Tor bridge relay. Facebook, which is also blocked in Russia, launched its own Tor version back in 2014. ([Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7dqxd/twitter-tor-onion-service-dark-web-version))

## Chipmakers warn of new speculative execution bugs

AMD, Arm, and Intel each published advisories about newly discovered ways to bypass hardware-based protections for speculative execution in modern CPUs. Back in 2018, Meltdown and Sepctre vulnerabilities led to a rash of security concerns around speculative execution, resulting in software-based partial mitigations and hardware changes on CPUs. Researchers at VUSec published a report detailing all existing hardware and software mitigations around speculative execution using what they refer to as Branch History Injection. This allows low privilege users to poison the global history used as a hardware mitigation for speculative execution attack to mispredict targets and subsequently leak data, The researchers demonstrated how this could be used to obtain a root hash password in a proof of concept attack. All three chip makers released mitigation recommendations with their security advisories.([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intel-amd-arm-warn-of-new-speculative-execution-cpu-bugs/))

## Online sleuths are using face recognition to ID Russian soldiers

In France, the CEO of a law enforcement and military training company called Tactical Systems took a screenshot of a Russian soldier’s face, taken from a video posted on Telegram, and within an hour, using face recognition services available to anyone online, he identified the soldier by name, and found his Instagram account.

personalfinance,Repayment mortgage Vs Interest only + Invest,"Hello all,

I wanted to get other peoples opinion on something that sprung to mind one evening. I currently have a repayment mortgage and I thought about how when repaying your mortgage the equity in your home really isn't working for you, its essentially dead money eroding with inflation just like cash in the bank. I thought, what could be done to prevent this, which got me thinking - What if I transferred onto an interest only mortgage and invested the ""repayment"" part of the mortgage. I'll give an example below:

**Repayment mortgage (based on 2% interest)**

* £848 a month repayment 
* 200k mortgage over 25 years
* Total repayment £254,357.00 (£54,357 in interest)

**Interest only mortgage (based on 2% interest)**

* £334 a month
* 200k mortgage over 25 years
* Total repayment £300,077.00 (£100,007.00 in interest)

Therefore if the £514 (£848-£334) is invested into the S&amp;P at an assumed 8% return (typically returns between 8-10%) for 25 years within an ISA the returns are £488,827 and tax tree. At the end of the 25 years you then pay off your mortgage so in total £488,827 - £200k - £100,077 = £188,750 better off. I'm fully aware this is a riskier proposal than simply just paying off your mortgage like normal but I'm struggling to see many negatives. I really do not want to realise 20 years down the line that I have missed something major and it all to go tits up, so any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

**""But the stock market might crash and you're left with nothing""**

My argument to this is over the 25 years there is undoubtably going to be large dips and rises in the market but it always averages out over time. The only negative to this would be the possibility of markets crashing at the end of the 25 years where I would want to withdraw my funds, but worst case scinario I can just extend my interest only mortgage for a couple of years and wait for the market to recover. 

**""What if interest rates rise over an extended period of time""**

Due to the nature of interest only mortgages, higher interest rates are obviously not good news for anybody on an interest only mortgage, if this was to occur I can simply swap back onto a repayment mortgage for a period and wait for interest rates to cool off. 

**""You will not have equity in your house to upsize if needed""**

A valid point but I personally can't see this being an issue in my situation.",finance,1647012781.0
solar,GoSun kitchen - upgradeable? Better alternatives?,"Greetings.  


I'm interested in having a little bit of power in a grid-down situation. (Being able to run a computer would be nice, but might be pushing it). While I have done some home-electrical work, and have done some reading on solar, I'm a newb. I might also mention I'm in Alberta, Canada.   


My wife discovered the GoSun kitchen, and it looks pretty cool. A couple of panels, battery packs, a cooker, and a cooler. [https://gosun.co/products/solar-kitchen](https://gosun.co/products/solar-kitchen) . What's more, she's interested, and a wife-acceptance factor is not to be sniffed at. I really love that it is consumer level, and I can get everything in one go. But there's no way it'll power a computer; charging a phone is nice, though. It does seem pretty practical; I hadn't even considered heating and cooling food, and that might be more important than running a computer.  


My friend pointed out that I could get better panels at, say, [https://www.cdnsolar.ca](https://www.cdnsolar.ca), and also pointed to a place with better batteries.  


I suspect that the downside of an all-in-one system is that it isn't designed to be upgraded with third-party parts. On the other hand, by the time I spec out PV cells, a charge controller, a battery system, and an inverter, I've spent a lot of time and money.  


Is there anything simple I should be looking at that I can upgrade? If not, any good systems where I can get something to start and add on to it later?

personalfinance,What to do with savings,"Hi all. My husband and I are pretty young and we come from lower middle class backgrounds so haven’t really got the network to ask so I was hoping we could ask for some recommendations here.

Current situation:
We own a house in Arizona on which we made a 20% downpayment and remortgaged last year to get a lower interest rate so our mortgage is pretty low. The house has since almost doubled in value but that’s of no benefit to us having no plans to move.

We own (no mortgage) a small vacation home in Europe where I’m from that does okay on vacation rental income.

We are saving hard so the plan was to buy another property (to rent out) with a big down payment and a small mortgage but the market seems to be hot in every place we’re interested. Whether that’s in our current state or my husbands home country.

So now the money just sits in savings which I’m fine with (we like savings in my culture haha) but frustrates my husband. It’s around 100k and with our incoming vs low outgoing will probably double in the next 12 - 24 months. 

So I guess my question is, is it stupid to keep saving and just have the money “sit” there? What are other ways of being “smart” with money?",finance,1647015262.0

We were planning on using our return to supplement my unpaid maternity leave (6 weeks max) while my husband works for about 5 weeks of my leave. 

Backstory: husband and I got married at the end of 2020, we currently have 1 child,  taxes were fairly simple to file on turbo tax, our return was smaller than I had anticipated but I figured that was okay. I switched to a higher paying job in January 2021 and was advised by my accountant family friend to file my W4 as ""married filing jointly"" claiming 1 dependent (with the new worksheet they have which isn't select 0 or 1 etc., but rather a dollar amount).

This year i got my W2 back and thought nothing of it until we were filing on TurboTax (which I hate because they seem to always have something wrong but that's a new story for a different day).

I made a couple thousand more than my husband (give or take about $3k) and that was around $26k but my Federal Income Tax Withholding amount was ONLY $301.14.  Not a typo. I have only ever had to pay taxes on a job I got 1099'd for. Turbo tax states that when I file I owe around $1100 in taxes but with my husband's return, we are still getting a return, just a lot lower than anticipated. 

My family is TERRIBLE with finances and taxes but the accountant doesn't seem to understand what I'm asking for. Can someone advise on the following?


1. How should my husband and I file our W4 so we never owe the government a dime at the end of the year? Get a return yearly kind of thing?

2. Is it better to get a return or to get a ""you paid what you needed to"" at the end of the year, no return and no money owed? 

3. Financially we live paycheck to paycheck and are awaiting the arrival of another baby here in June. What would be best for us in this situation? Get a second job or change filing status (suggested by a family member).

4. Who is the best kind of person to speak with so I don't fall in the same hole of hell that is tax liens, bankruptcy, financial hardship my family did because my financial/tax knowledge is VERY poor and my husband isn't much better than me?

CryptoCurrency,Money while you sleep? Passive income with staking,"Staking is a great way to use your crypto to generate passive income, especially because some cryptocurrencies offer high interest rates for staking.

I’m not going to talk about what staking is, this is mainly for those who have an idea or already stake their crypto.

These are some benefits of staking crypto

1. Easy way to earn interest on your crypto holdings
2. No equipment needed
3. More environmentally friendly than mining 
4. Earning additional Tokens. Increasing the amount of tokens and coins you have. A great example of this would be Fairyswap’s Genesis Staking. If you enter FRA (Findoras native token) in its staking pool, you can capture early stage APY and $FAIRY. Other places like coinbase, kraken or pancakeswap among with many others do this as well.
5. Helps to maintain efficiency of the blockchain

Staking allows you to earn more crypto, and receive interest rates that are generous. In some cases, you can earn more than 10% or 20% per year. It's a profitable way to invest your money.

stocks,Cathie Wood’s ARKK Lures Almost $1 Billion Even as ETF Sells Off,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund is down almost 40% this year. Some investors, though, are piling in -- wary of missing out on potential gains should the tide turn in its favor. 

The $11 billion ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) is on track to see its fifth straight week of inflows totaling roughly $1.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Traders have added money to the fund for three consecutive months now, the longest such streak in a year, with a net intake of $965 million for 2022 so far.

That’s happening as Wood’s growth-centric ETF gets hit on multiple fronts. The Federal Reserve is commencing a rate-hiking cycle, while the war in Ukraine pushes up commodity prices, leading to concerns that economic growth and corporate profits could slow. 

But for some investors, “it’s opportunistic investing,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. “Maybe it’s an opportunity to rebalance and buy some of these big-name, good companies that have been in this correction and the prices are cheaper.”

The S&amp;P 500 is on pace to notch its second consecutive week lower, but retail traders haven’t been deterred by the volatility. They’ve become a reliable support pillar for the market, plowing cash toward stocks for nine straight weeks. Partly, it’s a habit developed during the Covid-19 crash -- and one that’s proving stickier than many expected. Back then, buying during the March lows proved very profitable, including for ARKK enthusiasts. 

Gaffney says there’s a swath of investors who are wary of missing out on any other potential big run-ups in prices. “You always get some people who feel like, ‘I missed out on the last big run, and I’m not going to miss that again, so I’m going to get in now when prices are cheap.’”

Wood is famous for making bets on high-growth disruptive firms in areas like biotech and clean energy. Her flagship fund rose roughly 150% in 2020, with Tesla Inc. -- one of her favored plays -- gaining 740% that year. But those types of companies are suffering a reversal of fortunes this year. 

ARKK peaked last February and is down 60% since then. It has only spent a third of the year in the green so far. 

But the broader tech-trade selloff has become over-extended as investors bailed amid prospects for higher rates, according to Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.

“That being as oversold as it was certainly would be a place where you could find people who sift through the wreckage and say, ‘I can, with a modicum of comfort, say that these things are overdone. Enough damage has been done,’” he said by phone. “That probably is what drives some of the interest of late.”

Wood has stuck to her thesis even amid the slump, though she had a rare moment of compunction earlier this month when she admitted that her 2020 prediction for oil prices at $12 was “wrong.” 

And though ARKK has seen inflows this year, Wood’s other funds have suffered outflows, with the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) seeing withdrawals of $143 million this year, and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) losing more than $435 million. 

“The challenge is obviously she takes a very long-term view, and what that looks like is trying to be predictive of things that are many years in the future -- and this environment is one that is actually devastating to that,” said Eric Leve, chief investment officer at Bailard. “Higher interest rates are just crushing high growth, especially smaller and mid-cap high-growth companies whose earnings prospects remain far in the future.”

personalfinance,ELI5: HELOC? Cash out refi?,"We have $16k left to pay on our off-grid house that’s probably worth $400k+ as-is. There are some pricey projects we want to get done though (re-do &amp; upgrade the solar system, bathroom remodel, interior paint and replace the front bay window). 

We just went through a month of hoops with a local credit union for a HELOC that they then said, “Oh, we don’t fund off-grid houses” despite the “solar system upgrade for off-grid house” being the stated reason for the credit application. 

I hate the adjustable &amp; high rate nature of a HELOC, but I like the only draw what you need part. I hate being so close to paying off the house only to get pulled back into the rigged borrowing game again, when I’d love for us to just sell this house and live somewhere with better schools and community programs. But the place we want to move, the houses cost twice as much. 

I like the more fixed nature of a cash out refinance, and since we’re looking at costs around $70k, it seems like even with associated closing costs, a lower interest rate (hopefully) will make it a better deal than a HELOC? 

Both options need to be repaid in a lump sum with the sale of the house, and the HELOC that didn’t fund had a penalty for selling the house within three years. 

It seems like cash out refi is a better idea, so what are the drawbacks I’m not seeing? Did the bank person just sell my spouse on the idea of a HELOC because the bank makes more money after the rate adjusts and promotional rates expire? 

I’m ticked they wasted our time as interest rates were going up. We have pretty bad timing with these sorts of things. 

Anyway, I’m very much a dummy about this sort of thing, so any help understanding the potential pitfalls and interest rates/overall financing costs would be appreciated.",finance,1647026517.0
personalfinance,My parents are at risk of losing their home due to a balloon payment.,"This story begins when I was about 5 years old so bare with my limited information and the length of this. 

Sometime before 2007 my parents had to take out a second mortgage on the house. Then, in 2007 they declared bankruptcy. This basically gave them a whole new mortgage with different interest rates. My mom, until about a month ago, had no idea this was set up as a balloon payment. The bank is saying they began sending letters letting them know it had changed to a balloon payment back in 2017, but my mom says she never saw these letters. About a month ago the bank sent a letter explaining if they cannot make the one time payment of ~$110k by May 10th, then the house will be foreclosed. This would be absolutely impossible for them to pay. 

The bank is saying they have no home equity, as it was a balloon payment set up, so they can’t use that through a mortgage lender. My mom has been on disability for the past ~8 years, and my dad does under the table construction work. Both of their credit scores are insanely low. 

They are talking with a mortgage lender right now about their options, and my dad basically doesn’t exist on paperwork. They told my mom their only option is to get a co-signer for the house, and “the only thing that matters is they have a credit score above 620”. This is where a multitude of other problems come into play. 

My parents are asking my older brother (27m) and I (21F) to co-sign to “save the family”. Both of us have credit scores above what was suggested by the lender. Both of us are hesitant for obvious reasons. My brother flat out said no today. I had 4 missed calls and about 7 unread text messages as I am now the only way out of this in their eyes. 

I tried to explain to them that they probably would not accept me as a co-signer due to my age. This was taken as a “no” from me, and now they are disappointed in me too. They keep saying things to my brother and I that make us both feel very guilty. 

Neither of my parents finished college. They have less financial knowledge than I do, and that’s really saying something. I feel like my family is on the verge of falling apart because a bank put such a predatory loan on them. Balloon payments are normally reserved for commercial businesses, not already struggling families. 

I genuinely don’t know what my next steps are going to be. I’ve been researching everything that I can, but I feel out of my depth. Any advice?

*UPDATE* I talked to my mom and explained that I will not be co-signing for various reasons, and that it would be best for them to sell and downsize. She responded with “K.” She then let me know they “will be needing boxes next time I get inventory in at my shop”.. as one user commented, let the emotional manipulation begin :)

*UPDATE PT2* Dad just called to tell me his close friend is going to be co-signing. He wanted to apologize for any stress this could’ve caused my brother and I. I’m not sure if this will be the right or wrong decision in the long run, but things have at least settled down for the night.

stocks,Don’t Expect an Investor Bailout From the Fed if Stagflation Returns,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-meeting-march-2022-51647015734?mod=hp\_LATEST](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-meeting-march-2022-51647015734?mod=hp_LATEST)

It was a lot more fun to be in your 20s in the ’70s than to be in your 70s in the ’20s. Not that I would know personally (yet), but this wry baby boomer lament, making its rounds on the internet, hits uncomfortably close to home.

I don’t actually associate the 1970s with fun, but rather prices running ahead of my paycheck, of queuing in gasoline lines on odd or even days, of not having enough cash for the items in my shopping cart, and of living in Brooklyn because it was cheap long before it was chic.

The sense of déjà vu should be strong at the Federal Reserve, as it now faces circumstances uncomfortably similar to those of the 1970s. Inflation is running at the fastest pace in four decades, with the consumer price index [up 7.9%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/februarys-inflation-report-is-here-expect-a-new-40-year-high-as-gas-prices-leapt-51646874159?mod=article_inline) in the 12 months ended in February—and before the latest surge in tabs at the gas pump and supermarket. That has meant real pay declines of 2.6% for American workers after inflation. So, despite unemployment under 4%, [consumer sentiment is sour](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), falling to the lowest level since 2011 as inflation expectations rose to the highest level since 1981, the University of Michigan reported Friday.

On the latter score, the latest [GDPNow first-quarter growth ](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow)estimate from the Atlanta Fed is just above stall speed at an annual rate of 0.5%. With flat growth, or worse, likely in the current quarter, that ’70s phenomenon of stagflation is all but palpable.

This is what the Federal Open Market Committee faces as it gathers for its regular policy meeting this coming week. In his congressional testimony last week, Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chair pro tempore (his official title while he and other Fed nominees await Senate confirmation), all but promised [a quarter-point increase](https://www.barrons.com/articles/inflation-recession-war-what-to-watch-as-feds-powell-testifies-to-congress-51646194452?mod=article_inline) in the federal-funds target range from the floor-hugging 0%-0.25%.

As with most corporate earnings reports, the actual number will mean less to the market than management’s forecasts about the coming year. The FOMC’s [last summary of economic projections,](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20211215.htm) released in December, is as out of date as a double-knit leisure suit. Back then, the monetary mandarins saw the economy growing at a robust 4% in 2022, with the personal consumption deflator—the central bank’s favored inflation gauge—running at a 2.6% clip by year-end. Ah, dream on.

So the world will be watching not what the FOMC does after its two-day meeting ending Wednesday, but what its policy statement and Powell say. At his afternoon press conference, he will certainly be quizzed about the way forward.

Regardless of the risks of a slowing economy and a faltering stock market, the inflation surge leaves the Fed no choice but to proceed with the first of a series of interest-rate hikes, according to Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer for fixed income at PGIM, Prudential’s asset-management arm, which was overseeing $957 billion in assets as of year end.

Anybody who thinks the Fed will cling to its playbook from the past few economic cycles is “delusional,” Peters said in a telephone interview. Inflation is the top problem, not just on Wall Street but also on Main Street and, especially, Washington.

For financial markets, that means a profound change. With inflation possibly running in the 8%-9% range after those recent sharp price pops work their way into official gauges, investors can’t count on the Fed riding to the rescue of a 25% or 30% downdraft in stock prices, Peter warns. The so-called Fed put—the central bank’s implicit insurance policy under the markets—isn’t dead, but its strike price is a lot lower than before, he says. In other words, with inflation taking precedence, monetary policy is unlikely to bail out investors, unless the markets’ slide threatens the real economy.

Even so, the vise squeeze between prices and recession is much less painful for the economy than it was in the 1970s. That’s the good news from Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. Food and energy costs take up 10% of consumers’ budgets, half as much as they did back then, with cars getting nearly twice the gas mileage as they did during the first OPEC embargo in 1973.

 The dollar’s status also is the reverse from back then, he adds in a client note. The beginning of unfixed currency exchange rates produced a “shock” 21% depreciation in the [U.S. Dollar Index](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/indexes/dxy), provoking commodity producers, chiefly OPEC, to ramp up prices. More recently, the stable greenback, which the rest of the world wanted, has allowed the Fed to ignore commodities. While China’s industrialization drove up commodity prices, U.S. consumers got falling goods prices, despite a wide trade deficit.

That points to a slow, steady lifting of the fed-funds rate to 2.5% over 18-24 months, Blitz says, despite equity market volatility. But if corporate earnings estimates fall enough, the Fed will stop hiking rates, he predicts.

The real, decadeslong tectonic change that Blitz sees is the end of what he calls the long peace from 1989 to 2019 (similar to [the interregnum of the Cold War](https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-russia-ukraine-51646354811?mod=article_inline) described by Matt Gertken, head of geopolitical analysis at BCA Research). With globalization reversing, expanding supplies from abroad will no longer put downward pressure on U.S. prices and wages. Onshoring doesn’t mean stagflation, he concludes, but raises the risk of credit sensitivity in the economy.

If you’re nostalgic, it should be for those halcyon days after the fall of the Berlin Wall and before 9/11, when we had to watch out for falling prices and had to determine how to deal with a budget surplus, and before recurring crashes in dot-com stocks, house prices, and a pandemic-induced shutdown. Ah, but to be in your 20s again, even with all that was wrong with the ’70s.",finance,1647030002.0
personalfinance,My Student Loan Plan,"Hey all!

I am looking for outside opinions on my situation, Thanks.

I currently have about $150,000 in federal student loans with an average of 6-8% interest rate, left. 

I have already paid off about $40,000 during this pause period. 

All of my undergrad loans are paid, leaving just my graduate loans left. 

I have savings bonds that are currently valued at $25,000.

Current income is about $85,000 a year.

Background: My grandpa begin buying savings bonds in my name, when I was born until his death, for later use of education or buying a house (knowing these are usually the two biggest costs in life); but understanding I can use them on whatever I want. Most of the bonds are Series EE with some being Series I. The bonds are not yet fully mature; some start to become fully matured in 2025, and more continue to mature as the years go on, until the last in 2040.

I live within my means, consider myself pretty finically responsible, and have budgeted to pay more than the minimum payments on the loans once the pause ends. I have been, and am currently, making payments during the pause to lower my balance.

I want to be aggressive at paying these loans off completely.

Questions: Should I cash the bonds in now, and put a dent into the loans, while there is a pause on interest? Should I hold the bonds until they fully mature (then do what I think is best with them at said time)? Should I wait until payments start back up, and pull some out every month? Should I try to pay off the loans best I can without the bonds, and keep them to use as a down payment on a house in the future? Is there anything else I am missing, or a different approach I should be taking to this situation?

personalfinance,Is going solar really worth it?,"Hello,
 
I recently had a consultation for going solar since my home is a good candidate ( south facing, simple roof full sun ). They offer 0 down and 25 years financing which would lower my current electric bill to a certain amount each month and then after the 25 years I own the system. The salesman’s said that in 25 years, monthly electric bills will go up and at the end of the 25 years they would be in the $500 range a month for electric. My normal bill is around 120, but in summer months it’s around 150. If I went solar, the monthly bill will be 116 for 25 years. Everything seems legit and sounds right, the only thing I don’t like is financing for 25 years at 1.49 interest rate. Also even if I don’t use my normal electric company, I still have to pay around $15 a month just to have it. Has anyone else gone solar and really seen the benefits the guy was talking about or was it a regret? Would like to know. I can answer anymore questions in the comments.  The total cost is around 38k for the system for my home.

Edit: thanks everyone for answering. It does seem like a to good to be true kind of thing. I do think outright buying the system would be a better idea overall as well. Also selling the home potentially with this attached to it really does sound like a nightmare. I think I’ll hold off and look at some other quotes as well.",finance,1647037773.0

gaming,Why are there no (literal) cloud surfing/exploration games!?,"Hey there I recently had a dream where I surfed through the clouds in the sky like through water. The thought never really left my mind the past few days so I tried to find a game with this kind of concept. Sadly I found virtually nothing. 

I wonder why that is. Personally I think of it as very very interesting and relaxing concept. In order for you to mabey understand me I will try my best to paint you a picture of the game I wish to find or to exist (if it does PLEASE give me a title I really want to play something like this):

First of all I imagine the game to be a third person game in a abzu-like art style. More sci-fi than fantasy with solar panels, motors and generally high-tech devices but devoid of high-tech facilities (might be a post-apocalyptic setting). I would prefer a personal story, like the sudden diappearance if your parents made you look for them instead of a heroic story like you have to save the world or remaining humanity.

The game starts in a small wooden hut . Your character wakes up, grabs his/her surfboard (mabey with a small motor to signify a piece of high-tech)and goes outside. There you see a small patch of earth where your hut is built on followed by an endless sea of white, fluffy clouds and a clear blue sky above (that will obviously make for a gorgeous night-sky filled with stars if time-flow exists inside the game). 
You take your board and jump into the clouds, using it as a means of traversal rather than a device for a sport. The cloud sea would be as flat as the actual ocean. There will be bigger mountains of clouds, patches without clouds or dark storm clouds.
You float through the mostely white sea and find more small islands floating inbetween the clouds. There you can either meet a small cast of characters or find new additions to your surfboard or alternatives to it (e.g. a kite for your board(similar structure and fuction to a solar cell), boots that have lower speed that the board but unable you to jump above spots without clouds or even a small sailboat to transport good across the cloud ocean.)

When exploring the sea you might mind mutated, flying whales, dolphins, sea turtles or other marine lifeforms with mutated/changed features that enable flying in sky/clouds. One lifeform I personally place a lot of importance on would be a mutated form of a leviathan found in black, lightning riddled storm clouds. First you would only be able to see their body outlined by the lightning they absorb but at one point you might be able to surf through the storm clouds by their side and see the actual body.

Why isn't there anything like this? It doesn't seem too far fetched in my opinion. Is there no interest in this or does it sound boring as fuck to you? I'm genuinely confused about this.

# **Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates in week ahead, as Ukraine crisis adds volatility - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/11/federal-reserve-expected-to-raise-interest-rates-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
&gt; Investors may take the Federal Reserve’s first post-pandemic interest rate hike in stride, while uncertainty over the Ukraine crisis continues to hang over markets.
*****
&gt; The Fed has clearly broadcast that it intends to raise its target fed funds rate by a quarter percentage point from zero, and it is expected to announce that move at the end of its two-day meeting Wednesday. The central bank should also reveal new forecasts for interest rates, inflation and the economy.
*****
&gt; There are a few economic reports of note in the week ahead, including the producer price index Tuesday, retail sales Wednesday and existing home sales Friday.
*****
&gt; “Earnings are over. Monetary policy is obviously going to be important here. I don’t see the Fed surprising anyone next week,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “It’s going to be a quarter point and then step into the background and watch what’s happening in Europe.”
*****
&gt; Stocks fell for the past week, with the Nasdaq Composite the worst performer with a 3.5% decline. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000, which outperformed the three major indexes, lost 1% for the week.
*****
&gt; A surge in oil prices spooked investors, with crude spiking to $130 at the beginning of the week but trading back below $110 on Friday.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 2.9% for the week. Energy stocks were the top performers, up nearly 1.9% and the only positive major sector.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; The impact of Russian sanctions on commodities markets and the lack of clarity around the outcome of the war in Ukraine are likely to keep volatility high across the financial markets.
*****
&gt; The central bank’s statement and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday will be closely watched for guidance on how Fed officials view the Ukraine crisis, and how much it could affect their outlook and the path for interest rates.
*****
&gt; “His guidance is probably not going to be all that different from what he had to say in the [Congressional] testimony. Basically, downside risks to the growth outlook have increased. Upside risks to inflation have risen,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America.
*****
&gt; Because Russia is a giant commodities producer, its assault on Ukraine and resulting sanctions have set off a rally in commodities markets that has made already-scorching inflation even hotter. February’s consumer price index was up 7.9%, and economists said rising gasoline prices could send it above 9% in March.
*****
&gt; Gasoline at the pump jumped nearly 50 cents in the past week to $4.33 per gallon of unleaded, according to AAA.
*****
&gt; Market pros see surging inflation as a catalyst that will keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates. However, uncertainty about the economic outlook could also mean the central bank might not hike as much as the seven rate increases that some economists forecast for this year.
*****
&gt; Cabana expects Fed officials to forecast five hikes for 2022 and another four next year. The Fed previously anticipated three increases in both years. Cabana said the Fed could cut its forecast for 2024 to just one hike, from the two in their last outlook.
*****
&gt; Any comments from the Fed on what it plans for its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet will also be important, since officials have said they would like to begin to scale it back this year after they start hiking interest rates. The Fed replaces maturing Treasury bonds and mortgages as they roll off, and it could slow that in a process Wall Street has dubbed “quantitative tightening” or QT.
*****
&gt; “That they will be ready to flip the switch on QT in May is our base case, but we acknowledge there are risks that this will be skewed later,” said Cabana. He said if the Fed finds it is not in a position to raise interest rates as much as it hoped, it could delay shrinking the balance sheet right away, which would leave policy looser.
*****
&gt; # Bond market liquidity
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield topped 2% at its highest level Friday, after dipping below 1.7% earlier this month as investors sought safety in bonds. Bond yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; “It’s inflation and inflation expectations. Treasurys behave in this environment a little differently than a flight to quality asset,” Cabana said “That’s a different dynamic than we’ve observed. You may see a flight to quality into Treasurys, but the Treasurys are reflecting higher inflation expectations.”
*****
&gt; Cabana said the markets are showing signs of concern around the uncertainty in Ukraine. For instance, the Treasury market is less liquid.
*****
&gt; “We have seen that the Treasury market has become more volatile. We’re seeing bid-ask spreads have widened. Some of the more traditionally less liquid parts of the market may have become less liquid, like TIPS and the 20-year. We’re also seeing market depth thinning out,” he said. “This is all due to elevated uncertainty and lack of risk-taking willingness by market participants, and I think that should worry the Fed.”
*****
&gt; But Cabana said markets are not showing major stress.
*****
&gt; “We’re not seeing signs the wheels are falling off in funding or that counterparty credit risks are super elevated. But the signs there are very much that all is not well,” he said.
*****
&gt; “The other thing we continue to watch loosely are funding markets, and those funding markets are showing a real premium for dollars. Folks are paying up a lot to get dollars in a way they haven’t since Covid,” he said.
*****
&gt; Cabana said the market is looking for reassurance from the Fed that it is watching the conflict in Ukraine.
*****
&gt; “I think it would upset the market if the Fed reflected a very high degree of confidence in one direction or another,” he said. “That seems very unlikely.”
*****
&gt; # Dollar strength
&gt; The dollar index was up 0.6% on the week and it has been rising during Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The index is the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies and is heavily weighted toward the euro.
*****
&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, also points out that the dollar funding market is seeing some pressure but it is not strained.
*****
&gt; “The dollar is at five-year highs today against the yen. That’s not what you would expect in a risk-off environment,” he said. “That’s a testament to the dollar’s strength.”
*****
&gt; Chandler said it’s possible the dollar weakens in the coming week if it follows its usual interest rate hike playbook.
*****
&gt; “I think there might be a buy the rumor, sell the fact on the Fed,” he said. “That’s typical for the dollar to go up ahead of the rate hike and sell off afterwards.”
*****
&gt; # Oil on the boil
&gt; Oil gyrated wildly this past week, touching a high not seen since 2008, as the market worried there would not be enough oil supply due to sanctions on Russia. Buyers have shunned Moscow’s oil for fear of running afoul of financial sanctions, and the U.S. said it would ban purchases of Russian oil.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures jumped to $130.50 per barrel at the beginning of the week but settling Friday at $109.33.
*****
&gt; “I think the market getting bid up to $130 was a little premature,” said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC, noting the U.S. ban on Russian oil. She said the run-up in prices Monday came as market players speculated there would be a broader embargo on Russian oil, including Europe, its main customer.
*****
&gt; “Right now, the market is too extreme in either way. I think it’s justified at $110. I think it’s justified over $100. I don’t think we’re headed for an off-ramp, and I think we have room to go higher,” she said.

&gt; # Gas Prices Hit A New Record

&gt; Crude oil may have reversed lower this week, but it's hard to tell when drivers head to the pumps. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline has continued to rise to hit a record high of $4.33 in data from AAA going back to 2004. While prices typically rise this time of year, the vertical move this year has meant prices have grown at a much more rapid rate than normal.

&gt; # Doomsday Fear Index

&gt; During the Cold War, American children and adults were educated on how to best protect themselves from a nuclear explosion. This included measures from the silly ""duck and cover"" campaign to nuclear fallout shelter instructions. If you happen to be curious about the federal government's current recommendations in regards to protection from a nuclear blast, you can read up on the instructions here. We're not sure how focused people will be about wearing a mask in the event of nuclear fallout, but we guess you can never be too careful!

&gt; With tensions between Western nations and Russia reaching levels not seen since the Cold War, we took a look at Google Trends to identify the level of fear in the American population with respect to the current war in Ukraine. We looked at the search volumes for terms like nuclear war, WWIII, canned food, Potassium Iodide, and gas mask. Searches for many of these terms hit five-year highs in the early days of the Russian invasion but have subsided since. The current level is still well above normalcy, but fears appear to have eased over the last week as the West's retaliation has been almost entirely economic (or maybe there is no internet service in the fallout shelters). The aggregate index is pictured below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/Doomsday-Index-031022.png))**

&gt; Below are charts of each search term we utilized in the composition of our index. Potassium Iodide, the compound utilized to mitigate the effects of excessive radiation exposure, is the only term that remains at a five-year high in terms of search volume. While searches for some of these terms were actually much higher during the early days of COVID, they all experienced upticks in the last few weeks. All-in-all, based on search trends based on fears of a nuclear situation or war with Russia spiked when the Ukraine invasion first started, but those fears have over the course of the last week.

&gt; # Investor Sentiment Remains Volatile

&gt; Considering equities and other risk asset prices continue to swing violently, so too have readings on investor sentiment. The weekly AAII survey of individual investors saw the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fall back below 25% this week after rising above 30% last week. While that is not the largest drop in recent months (the second week of January saw bullish sentiment fall 7.9 percentage points compared to 6.4 today), it nonetheless reaffirmed that investor confidence is shaky, if not undecided, at the moment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031022-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; The drop in bullish sentiment was mostly picked up by those reporting as bearish. Bearish sentiment rose 4.4 percentage points to 45.8%. While that reading is roughly 15 percentage points above the historical average for bearish sentiment, the reading is still lower than an even more pessimistic reading only two weeks ago when more than half of respondents reported as bearish.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031022-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; With the inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread has pulled back to -21.8. As with bullish and bearish sentiment, even if that does not set a new low, it is only in the 5th percentile of readings going back to the start of the survey.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031022-Sentiment-3.png))**

&gt; After the largest single-week decline in nearly 20 years two weeks ago, neutral sentiment has been clawing its way back into the range it was in for most of the past year. Gaining another 2 percentage points this week, the reading is now back above 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031022-Sentiment-4.png))**

&gt; Across each category of the report, there have been sizable swings in the past two months. To highlight this, in the chart below we show the eight-week rolling average of the absolute week over week change for each sentiment reading (bullish, bearish, and neutral) over the past 20 years. Over the history of the survey, weekly changes have gravitated towards smaller swings meaning the past decade is structurally a bit different relative to the decade before that. That being said, the weekly swings in the AAII readings on sentiment have been some of the largest of any period of the post-Global Financial Criss era. In fact, not even the COVID crash saw such volatility in sentiment (given optimism collapsed and then remained muted for some time rather than swing back and forth) while the only times this average was as high as now in the past decade were the spring of 2013, February 2016, and January 2019.

&gt; # More Volatility Likely in March, Recent Lows Remain Key

&gt; Thus far the market has been unable to find any real traction in the historically bullish month of March. As of today’s close DJIA is down 3.72% in March. S&amp;P 500 is off 4.65%, NASDAQ is fallen 6.95% while the Russell 2000 is lower by 4.15%. Today’s gain by the small-cap Russell 2000 is somewhat encouraging and adds to the accumulating evidence that the market may finally be coming to terms with Ukraine, inflation, and the Fed. As we have noted in recent posts, investor sentiment has reached bearish levels last seen at the start of the covid-19 pandemic, S&amp;P 500 has held its intra-day low reached on February 24 and VIX, although elevated, has not exploded to full-blown panic levels.

&gt; In addition, we can add March’s typical performance over the last 21-years to this list. As you can see in the chart above, the market has tended to selloff early in March and find a bottom around the sixth trading day of the month. Today was the sixth trading day. Afterwards the trend remains choppy, but it is generally higher until the end of the month.

&gt; # Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful

&gt; On this 13th Anniversary Global Financial Crisis Low, we may want to heed the wise words of one of the greatest investors of all time. “You try to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.” – Warren Buffett

&gt; So we ask: are we hitting another March market low on the 13th anniversary of the Global Financial Crisis low? It’s too early to be sure, but today’s rally and the recent dire projections and fearful sentiment are encouraging. CNN’s Fear &amp; Greed Index shown above has clearly reached the extreme fear levels associated with market lows and turns.

&gt; Last week we posted how it was beginning to look like Investors Intelligence Bullish and Bearish Advisors % were indicating that contrary bearish sentiment was near bottoming levels. This may not be the final low, but the bottoming process is clearly underway. Sit tight and stick to your system.

&gt; # Country ETFs Falling Below Pre-COVID Highs

&gt; Headed up to the two-year anniversary of the COVID crash low (3/23/20), equities around the globe have been experiencing some of the worst pullbacks since that period. In the table below, we show the country ETFs of the countries tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard as well as their year and month to date performance, performance since each respective 52-week high as of 2/19/20 (the S&amp;P 500 and a handful of other global indices last high before entering bear markets during the COVID crash) and current 52-week high. We also show where they are currently trading with respect to their 50-DMAs.

&gt; Given the degree of declines recently, nearly everything is oversold with six countries' readings now 'off the chart' as they trade well over three standard deviations below their 50-DMAs. The average country ETF is also down double digits on both a YTD basis and relative to their respective 52-week highs. Of the countries shown below, only Brazil (EWZ) and South Africa (EZA) are higher YTD with gains of 17.56% and 9.27%, respectively. Russia (RSX), meanwhile, is obviously down the most having been cut by over 75%.

&gt; The average country ETF is now down over 20% from its 52-week high, and only four of those 52-week highs have come since the start of 2022 whereas most were set last spring. As for how the current drawdowns have eaten into the post-COVID rallies, below we also show the percent change of these ETFs relative to their 52-week highs as of 2/19/20. In other words, where each ETF is trading with respect to their pre-COVID highs. Currently, there are only 8 country ETFs that remain above their respective pre-COVID highs. Seven others, meanwhile, have now declined more than 20% below their pre-COVID highs. Of course, Russia is once again down the most dramatically from those levels falling more than 75%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/030822-GMD-Table-1.png))**

&gt; Below we show the charts of those eight countries that are currently still in the green relative to pre-COVID highs. The recent rough patch is not exactly identical for all countries though. Whereas the downtrends for some like Taiwan (EWT) or the US (SPY) are bringing these ETFs to multimonth lows, others like Canada (EWC) and Norway (ENOR) have more or less trended sideways. Since retaking pre-COVID highs, only Australia (EWA) has gone on to recently retest/fall back below those levels which it did in late January. While it would mean much further downside for the likes of EWT, SPY, and EWC, those prior highs could mark one area of tangible support for these other countries.

&gt; # The Little Guy Eying Inflation

&gt; Looking across the range of issues surveyed by the NFIB, labor and inflation remain front and center of what most concerns small businesses. As shown below, the combined percentage of respondents reporting either cost or quality of labor as their most important problem continues to be the most prevalent topic with 33% of firms reporting as such. That is down slightly from 34% in January thanks to the decline in quality of labor. Most other categories fell to or remained at record lows. Such was the case for Poor Sales, Competition from Big Business, Government Requirements and Red Tape, and Financial &amp; Interest Rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/030822-NFIB-MIP-2.png))**

&gt; Last month the percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest problem went unchanged from the December reading of 22%. This month that reading gained another 4 percentage points to cross above a quarter of all respondents for the first time on record going back to 1986. Behind labor concerns (the combined reading of cost and quality of labor), this is the most commonly reported problem, and based on the action in commodities prices over the last couple of weeks, this reading will almost certainly increase again next month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/030822-NFIB-MIP-3.png))**

&gt; That means what has usually been the second most important problem on a combined basis recently, government requirement and taxes, dropped in the ranking. In fact, the 3 percentage point decline in government requirements offset the one percentage point increase in taxes to tie the November 2005 reading for the lowest on record. As we have noted in the past, the past few presidential cycles have structurally seen lower readings in these indices when Republicans were in office and vice versa when Democrats have held the presidency. With Biden currently in office, the record low reading is somewhat unusual from this political perspective.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/030822-NFIB-MIP-4.png))**

&gt; That is not the only category that has fallen to record lows. Poor sales and competition from big business have both fallen dramatically in the past couple of years.

So the interest rate on my bond can change by the whim of the govt?

2) Also, how can the series I bond yield become less attractive over time as interest rates rise if yields on other govt bonds can reach as high as series I bonds?

3) How long are the maturities on them?

4) Does it make sense to invest in them compared to other investments?

defi,Thoughts on my defi learning progress?,"I'm still very new to this world so I'm open to any thoughts, critics, or suggestions on my learning progress thus far, as I'm sure I still have some underlying misconceptions about crypto and defi. I live in the US and am in favor of both decentralization and centralization when appropriate.

I don't have a lot of money and defiantly don't have enough invested to worry about capital gain/loss taxes but nevertheless I am very conservative with my stable coins. I want to see them (at least USDC, DAI, and UST) given more attention by the fed before I stake my savings into it but at the same time I view them as a way to minimize exposure to inflation. Because of this rationale I don't really trust platforms like anchor or beefy that are offering ridiculous apy on their coins, and another main reason why I've left stable coins out of this list entirely is because from my personal audits gemini is the only platform I trust to handle lending my stable coins for me 100%.

I know there have to be some platforms that are truly making insane yields and are paying out investors fairly but it's so time consuming to audit how these cexs, dexs, and doas are making money that I've just had to make it a rule to stay away from anything that seems to good to be true. Even if the platform has lots of liquidity, money deposited, or staked I still don't trust it until I can see where the money is actually coming and going from. If you all have some insider info on how these super high apy deposit sites are holding their reserves, making these yields, and how they are distributed then feel free to share the supporting documents so we can openly audit them!

Also I'm pretty bent on maintaining full custody of my assets, hence the reason why I marked any LPs as no, they are not fully owned by the investor (myself), and why I include argent (stark/zk ftw). I understand that wrapping and staking coins removes some level of security and ownership so you're probably thinking ""why don't I trust pools?"" Well on one hand I'm somewhat confident in my understanding of the tech but on the other hand I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to understanding the market... I would like to earn some yield that is better than what you can earn depositing/lending/staking so it seems liquidity pools might be for me, but I can't keep up with the constant due diligence that seems to be required and permanent loss scares the shit out of me.

Also I mine btc so don't have to worry about fiat onboarding for btc, but for other tokens (eth, avax, matic, etc.)  I'm planning on investing usd so any suggestions for some fait on-ramps would also be great as well! Lastly, that brings me to the actual process of transferring any coin into a yield bearing coin. Like I said I'm new here so these are just the onboarding process I've found so far, and to me most of them seem a little overbearing (too many steps + fees along the way) hence why I made this chart in the first place. So, if there are anyways to optimize the processes I've found or alternatives to them I would love to hear it! Really though any incite on the subject would be great to hear as I'm finding a lack of current/reliable information out there, and as fun as learning this on my own has been I think it's time to start having some conversations with the community!

I wrote it at 4am as a rough draft so I could get some opinions when I woke up, please forgive me. I know the post is all over the place so I apologize for the mess, but I'm planning on make a much clearer and more in depth post about everything I've found so far to help out anyone else who is just getting their feet in the water like me!

btc,Ukraine official says role of crypto is essential in terms of helping the army,"From behind the New York Times paywall:

&gt; [...], I posed a question about crypto to Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. Since the Russian invasion, Mr. Bornyakov and his team — led by the country’s digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov — have been working around the clock to coordinate crypto donations for Ukraine’s army. Tens of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies have been sent to these addresses, and the money has been used to buy military supplies, including bulletproof vests and night-vision goggles.
&gt;
Mr. Bornyakov, [...] said that one advantage of using crypto to raise money was how quickly the funds could be disbursed.
&gt;

CryptoCurrency,One of the most important parts of Biden's new executive order is ensuring that Bitcoin is ESG compliant,"I don't see enough people mentioning this but it's very important to note and may be one of the biggest key factors in BTC getting to 100k and beyond.

Basically what this means is Biden wants organizations to research BTC's carbon footprint and find out how much energy it actually waste and if it is green so to speak. The reason why this is great is because as we know, BTC energy usage has always been one of the biggest pieces of FUD that just won't seem to go away. If this however is researched properly by these organizations they will see that BTC uses 3x less than banking and the gold industry and is very very energy efficient especially considering the growing use cases.

So this combined with Fed coin eventually coming out will be somewhat of a make or break for the industry and may very well be the catalyst for a bullrun to begin",cryptocurrency,1647093491.0
personalfinance,How does one decide if it makes sense to take a loan to install solar?,"Hello everyone!

I’ve been looking at solar for about five years. My electric bill is small ($100/month), but I’m intending to add additional members to my household, an EV in the near future, and insulate myself against future energy price increases. 

The cost of an oversized (10kW) system to account for our future need is $20,000 installed. I live in an area plagued by natural disasters and outages, so for an extra $4,000 I can install a solar controller that’s capable of providing real time backup to the house when the grid goes down. Or, in lieu of the fancy solar controller, I can get a battery for $10,000 instead. They only have a 10 year lifespan which makes me see the battery as an expensive maintenance item. I’m leaning toward the one-and-done $4,000 solar controller option for this reason.

It’s $24,000 installed, then, for the system. Interest rates are 4% if I take out a loan. At current energy prices and at my current usage level the payback period is lengthy. However, after replacing my vehicle and accounting for (1) decrease in government subsidies next year, (2) increases in cost of solar and grid power in the near term, (3) replacing my monthly fuel bill with free electricity, and (4) the equity the system adds to the value of the home (~$12,000) the system seems like a good deal overall, even if the money is borrowed. 

Am I looking at this objectively or do I just have the “solar bug”, as Dave Ramsey often likes to say? Any third-party analysis is welcome and appreciated!

Thank you!

Note: The home is not paid off. I owe $29k on the note and will have it paid off this year. Other debt is only $14,000 for a camper that we love and use often. If a loan is taken for the solar system, it becomes a significant portion (40%) of our overall household debt.",finance,1647094054.0

However, all of that income was from unemployment and as I understand it MassHealth waived eligibility requirements during COVID. I'm sure tax software just hasn't been updated to account for that, but now I'm wondering how to respond to the section where it says I'm subject to penalties and need to decide if I want to file an appeal. On one page, it says the penalty I'm subject to is $0 which makes me think I shouldn't bother. On the next page where it provides me a box to check if I want to appeal, it says ""Important information if you are filing an appeal: You will receive a follow-up letter asking you to state your grounds for appeal in writing, and submit supporting documentation. Failure to respond to that letter within the specified time will lead to a dismissal if your appeal and will result in a future assessment of a penalty."" So, it says for now that the penalty is $0, but if I decide not to appeal could I be hit with a higher penalty? I know I shouldn't be receiving any penalty, but appealing sounds like a hassle and I'm just hoping that if I don't appeal they'll know I'm good. Should I appeal just in case, or leave it be?

investing,Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better,"Ive been bullish for a long time despite even the pandemic. I was confident the FED would do the right thing and raise rates, and the government would chill the fuck out with the spending. (Monetary and fiscal policy).

Well, after seeing inflation data and the governments response, I’m bearish. Biden blames Russia 100% for inflation. There is zero talk of cooling spending, he even said “I’m sick of the American people saying government spending causes inflation”. Fact, high government spending is one of the many parts of demand pull inflation which is what we are experiencing; unless he has discovered a new facet of Keynesian economics.

Now there are [speculation] talks of an invasion of Taiwan, if that happens we are definitely fucked because thats where almost all of our silicon comes from. (This is the most speculatory part, it is a risk that needs to be considered though)

Inflation is going to get worse. The government is not going to do shit as they’ve indicated. Since 2008 the government solution to everything is to throw money at it. The fed isnt going to do shit, theyve literally fucked themselves into a corner. They cant raise rates, we wont be able to pay for our debt. (I mean raise them significantly. Not fucking .25%)

I think we are in for a horrible fucking quarter with where gas prices are. The spike in gas prices solidified my bearishness: when gas prices are up literally everything under the sun costs more.Companies will need to raise prices more, consumers will become priced out and more frugal, demand will fall, stagflation. 

This being said I am holding still, but I will be waiting a couple months before buying more. Especially after Q2.

Also, why are NO politicians holding the FED accountable right now? Ive seen nothing in the news cycle about it.

Oh yeah lets not forget the housing market is absolutely fucked right now.

Edit: a lot of you seem to think 8% inflation is good for stocks. LOW inflation (2%) IS good for stocks and economic growth. HIGH inflation is VERY bad for the economy, head math: prices go up, value of money goes down, consumers buy less. Bad.",finance,1647114402.0
solar,"Advice upgrading an existing PV system (installer, panels, EV charger, etc.)","Hi all,

For the last two years I've had a 7.92kWp PV system with 22 LG 360 panels running through a SolarEdge inverter w/ power optimizers (SE7600H-US000BNU4).  All 22 panels are on the east side roof.  Looking at the SE reports, I've averaged 8500kWh / year which has been good enough to avoid an electric bill for 10/12 months.  (My town in the western Chicago suburbs has 1:1 net metering which is nice.)

We've recently converted our gas range to induction and have an EV on order for later in the spring.  I'd like to add panels to the west side roof in a way that maximizes the use of our existing inverter without incurring too much clipping and will offset the increased electrical use in the future.  Dealing with installers has been frustrating in the past so I'd like to have as much figured out ahead of time so I can just explain what I want and cut through the BS.  This leads to my questions:

1) Should I stick with my original installer or explore using a different one?  I was pretty frustrated with the company who installed the system (they installed a different product than what was on my signed SOW), but after working through all that the equipment has been running very well ever since. Will I face headaches and complications down the road with honoring warranties with two different installers involved?

2) Which panels should I go with an how big can I make this system?  I just learned that LG is exiting the solar market which is really disappointing.  Since these panels would go on the street-facing side of the house, my wife is requiring all black.  My preference has always been for premium that will hold their efficiency over the course of 25 years, so I was looking at REC and Panasonic (&gt;90% @ 25 years), but some installers have been pushing Solaria and Q Cells (\~86% @ 25 years).  One company has said my inverter can handle another 3.88kW and configured something using 12 panels @ 4.32kW and claimed SolarEdge was OK with this amount.

3) Which EV charger would be recommended with my setup?  I'd like to be able to charge the car while the system is actively generating electricity and avoid pulling from the grid.  I saw that SolarEdge has their own EV smart charger and integration with the existing ecosystem is appealing, but looking at my particular inverter I don't see an EV port on the bottom.  Would integration still be possible?  Or is there a better option that would still do what I need?

4) Are Illinois SRECs even a consideration for a system upgrade?  I've already completed the SREC process and got my rebate 2 years ago.  Everything I've researched is about newly installed systems, I can't find anything about system upgrades.  It's not a deal-breaker, the federal tax credit is still good and I'm motivated by the environmental impact more than anything else, but the lower cost would still be nice.

CryptoCurrency,"NFTs have so much use cases aside from art and it is pretty infuriating that ignorant people who don't understand its potential uses call the entire space a ""pyramid scheme"".","For those who do not know what an NFT is, it can be simply described as a digital token that is stored in the blockchain. It is also Non-fungable, meaning that it is not interchangeable with other NFTs, unlike Bitcoin or Monero, as 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC, same with Monero.

And to people who will say that NFTs are nothing more than a bubble(or the entire crypto ecosystem for that matter), yes the current art market for NFTs are most likely a bubble and more than 90 percent of those ""projects"" will either crash or turn out to be scams. These things are not what I am interested in. I am interested in its practical applications.

Now, onto the potential use cases for it.

It can be used for:

1 - Event ticketing, making counterfeiting tickets impossible, as when exactly each NFT was sold would be traceable in the blockchain, ensuring that only those that purchased it before a specific date could attend an event.

2 - Real estate and cars. This would help in avoiding all the red tape of taxation, as when you purchase an NFT, it would automatically pay it's taxes to the authorities, ensuring that buying real estate would be as easy as buying the JPEG of a monkey.

3 - Going into debt to fund a business in a decentralized way that also avoids major institutions like banks, as some actions that banks would take a fee off can be handled by the smart contract. For example, you create a collection of 10.000 NFTs, each selling from a price of 100. You ensure by the smart contract that it will buy back these NFTs exactly 1 year later for 107 dollars, if it has the capital. All this means that you took a loan with 7 percent interest rate not from a bank, but from the average individual who might have risked only 100 dollars.

4 - Preventing naked short selling. Naked short selling occurs when a group of investors short stock that doesn't exist. This is suspected to have happened during the GME saga. Each and every single stock being traceable in the blockchain would ensure that no activities such as this can take place.

There are many other practical uses for NFTs that I can't think of right now, but I will post on reddit once I find out about them.

I will have a look in the morning, as I will be going to sleep now.

I tried posting the exact same text on r/unpopularopinion before posting here, it got deleted from r/unpopularopinion because it had NFT in it. This just proves the point I am making in my post LOL.",cryptocurrency,1647123570.0
CryptoCurrency,The Crypto Bull Case,"Just like the off-season for you favorite sport, slowdown in crypto volume lead to speculation and tinfoil hat theories. Crypto has come a long way in the last few years but just like any market, it is not immune to macro-economic factors,

Positive factors: Widespread exposure in retail and corporate investing strategies, incorporation it blue-chip applications (PayPal, cashapp etc), a publicly traded exchange (defeats the purpose of decentralization but does help legitimize crypto), adoption the payment and currency spaces, some have very promising tech that can help revolutionize how the digital age progresses, meaningful legislation on the horizon that doesn’t look to ban crypto.

Negative factors: highly speculative, early in lifecycle (negative for price stability), a damn war in Europe, rising interest rates and inflation, economic slowdown, shaky sentiment.

Now these factors that I listed (among others) are nothing new for 99% of you. However they’re important to call attention to because these same factors have similar impacts in other high-growth/high-speculation markets. We can see that in the down turn in blue chip growth stocks across the board. But as the positive factors increase, a floor forms and starts growing. Negative factors cap the volume/volatility that speculative assets live and die by.

Crypto has proven that price explosions can come at any time just like price implosion. However this volatility isn’t true growth. True growth happens as price floors increase over time. This leads to higher ceilings during explosions in the future through various channels. I think it’s hard to argue when looking at this weekly chart that we are still in a Bull market, just happen to be at the bottom end of the volatility cycle.

TL;DR crypto is affected by a number or macro-economic factors, however a single event can ignite the volume/volatility powder keg. We are still growing; albeit slower than some may expect. I AM BULLISH. This is not financial advice.

We also have an auto loan for $9k and some credit card debt for about $9k (I know, I know— that was before we learned how to spend responsibly) — both of which we’re paying extra on each month to chip away at. We have about $12k in savings plus I have a decent 401k  and pension building up with my employer.

I have good credit (720ish) but my husband doesn’t have any credit so the mortgage would just be in my name if we decided to buy soon.

It’s been a big goal of mine for the past couple years to buy a house but the supply of affordable housing has drastically declined the past couple years (as we all know) and even though we might be able to afford more on paper, I’m worried about payment shock considering any homes in my current city would have a mortgage payment at least double what we pay in rent.

I finally have a good job (ironically I work in mortgages)— pretty good pay with frequent raises, lots of opportunity for promotions and great benefits, so I feel like I can finally afford a home but now everything in my city is either super run down or would be stretching our budget a little too thin for comfort.

There are a few houses in a super rural town (like population 2500) about 40 minutes away from my current city that are really nicely updated and would be really affordable ($170k range) so I’m wondering if we should bite the bullet and just buy a nicer home but be about 40 mins away from our current city or wait until we could more comfortably afford something where we’re at.

Both of our jobs would stay the same so this would mean a longer commute to work and of course more money spent on gas, but I can’t stop thinking about how a house is a worthwhile investment (especially given the inflation rates right now).

I also know interest rates are going to continue going up which will also reduce how much I can afford in the future and as much as we want to think the housing bubble is gonna burst, I don’t anticipate that happening in my area (it will probably just slow down a bit).

TLDR; Should I:

1. Focus on paying off my debt and growing savings for the next couple years while we rent so we can hopefully afford something in our area in the next couple years, or 

2. Buy an affordable rural home and live there for a couple years while we build equity (still pay down debt, just at a slower rate). Then in a few years, use the equity to pay off any remaining debt and put the rest of the equity down to get us into a home in our city

**one more quick note— the credit union I work for has a few first time homebuyer programs so buying a home wouldn’t completely void us of our savings**

personalfinance,Buying a house - possibility of pay cut in 5-10ish years.,"Context: I just graduated from law school last year and work for a large law firm. The pay scale starts at $215k, which is obviously a lot. Given my current salary (and expected yearly increases), we can afford to make pretty large payments on a house. But I don't want to put on golden handcuffs. Most people leave jobs like this after a few years, and they typically take large pay cuts when they do.

Does anyone have experience with this sort of situation (i.e. potentially making a lot more money now than, say, 10 years in the future)? Is it common for people to make larger payments earlier in the term of the loan and then have the monthly payment reduced later on? My understanding is that making prepayments will just result in paying off the loan faster, but ideally we would want to build equity faster and then change the payment schedule so the monthly payments are smaller.

One more specific scenario I'm thinking about is getting a 15-year mortgage and eventually getting a modification or refinancing. I figure that since interest rates are likely to keep going up, that might not be the best move.",finance,1647134183.0

stocks,"I've essentially been a perma-bull, but this current market has me very nervous","Over the past decade, I've always been of the mindset that any pullback in the market would be temporary and in hindsight would be merely seen as excellent opportunities to buy the dip. For the most part that has worked out great.  Unfortunately this current market feels different.  

Nothing earthshattering here, but these are the issues that really worry me:

1. **Inflation / supply chain issues / Oil.** I was of the mindset that as covid restrictions were eased, supply chain issues would ease as well and the world economy would be unharnessed and supply chain issues would resolve.  Unfortunately that has not happened.  Particularly with oil, which is so interconnected across many industries.  There aren't any convincing signs that tell me inflation and supply issues will subside any time soon.  I would personally love to see the whitehouse incentivize american oil producers to ramp up oil production.  It's almost a patriotic duty.  We're sitting on massive amounts of oil, but american oil producers will not produce any more oil to help bring in more supply. Unfortunately I do not see any relief in sight on any of these issues.
2. **War in Ukraine.** At first I though the market tanking toward the beginning of the Ukraine invasion was an excellent buying opportunity, as the sanctions on Russia don't seem like they'll have a noticeable impact on most company's earnings (bought a bunch of GOOG and MSFT).  Unfortunately the constant fear of world war 3 is going to put a ceiling on this market.  Russia thought they'd just blow through Ukraine and call it good, but the Ukrainian heroics have forced Russia to shift to the long game.  This war could drag out for months if not years, especially since even if Russia eventually takes over the whole country, I imagine there will be constant insurgency and continued fighting.  Don't see an end to this any time in the near future.
3. **Fed rate hikes.** With inflation running wild and showing no signs of alleviating, the Fed has no choice but to continue to hike rates to try to get things under control.  While I'm seeing many people who are much smarter than me saying stagflation is not a legitimate risk for the country at this time, rate hikes certainly won't help with any growth.  

Not only do we currently have these major issues, but I don't see how any of them could be resolved in the near future.  I'm keeping my weekly dollar cost averaging going in my Vanguard account (I will never stop this), but I'm not planning on buying any individual stocks for the time being.  I'm more pessimistic than I've been for a long time.

Thoughts? Am I way off on anything / everything? I don't claim to be the knower of all things, so I'd love to hear other perspectives

Edit: For clarity, I'm not selling anything. I've got gotten too pessimistic to buy this dip. If it drops another 10% or so I'll reconsider again. Also, I won't just build up a big cash reserve that will waste away with inflation. I'm planning on putting my flow of excess cash in my Nexo account where I get 8% interest for holding stablecoin.",finance,1647136538.0
personalfinance,Can an immigrant spouse gift their U.S. citizen spouse their foreign-earned savings?,"My husband is immigrating to the U.S. next month, and he's really worried about losing a bunch of his savings from Korea via U.S. taxation when he sends his money over. We looked up the idea of him gifting it to me, and it seems great. But almost too easy, which makes us feel like we're overlooking some huge negative side to that plan (besides the exchange rate). Is there something we're failing to consider that could be unique to our situation?

He's saved about $200,000 and wants us to be able to use it toward buying a house here. I'm a U.S. citizen, he's a Korean citizen with a spousal visa. We haven't made a bank account for him yet since he's...y'know, not here. No strong opinions on a joint acct vs. individual. We both trust each other to look out for the other's best interests. I make about 40k living in North Carolina where both federal and state returns are filed (just moved here, the state return filing is new to me as a former FL resident). I've yet to file jointly since we've been married if that factors in at all.

Would he even be taxed on bringing in his foreign earned savings into the U.S.?

Will either of us have some sort of weird tax situation if he gifts me the money?

Would putting it into a joint account negate the concept of it being a gift to me?

Is it too large an amount to be tax exempt?

With car prices being inflated and I believe that they'll go down substantially in the future as the supply constraints start to ease and as interest rates rise. 

With interest rates rising and prices falling, most of the auto loans they gave out will be ""underwater"".  How much does this affect Ally? I think most car payments are around $300 a month which isn't that much even if they're ""underwater"". How big is the risk of people defaulting on their underwater automotive loans?

vet,"Pomeranian (10, male) in some kind of respiratory distress?","At about 4pm today (it is now 8pm where we live) we noticed our pomeranian was breathing rapidly like a very loud broken motor… it was so LOUD that we had to shout over the noise to be able to hear each other.  

Some history: never sick, maybe a little bit overweight (very food motivated) but he is only fed twice a day same as our other dogs his size and they are not overweight.

He has made this broken motor sound (like a kind of croaky frog) for many years now, but our vet didn’t really seem concerned about it and just brushed it off as him having this weird croaking breathing noise when he exerts himself or gets excited etc. His breathing has always seemed to be okay, appetite fine, nothing else was wrong except for this raspy croaky sound that he made often (but not consistently with every breath and not while resting).

Fast forward to today: I’m not sure if his inability to breathe properly is what has exacerbated the croaky sound or if the croaky broken motor noise is in itself a symptom of something else.

I’d like to emphasize that we live on an island where there are no animal clinics on Sundays and no emergency clinics. None. It is not an option. Despite knowing this, we rushed him to one of two vets on this island and knocked on their gates anyway out of desperation, but it was closed and a caretaker said there will be no vet until tomorrow 11am.

I messaged our regular vet asking to be seen but she said she does not do clinics on Sundays. I sent her videos which she looked at but beyond asking when this began, she hasnt communicated further. 

I have an uncle who is a farm vet but is out of town and we talked to him on the phone and he listened to our dog breathing and said it sounds like heat stroke. Per his suggestion we gave our dog a bath and dried him off in an airconditioned room. After that his breathing went from sounding like an exceptionally loud motor to wheezing. He still has an appetite. He can’t seem to fall asleep, it really looks like he is struggling to breathe even though his breathing has quieted down. Once in a while he seems to choke a little as if he wants to vomit something out, but he doesn’t. My uncle has asked to be sent videos… he says it’s strange because Pico still has an appetite (gets excited when we offer him treats and will gobble it all up). 

What else can we do? Or maybe somebody can message me some suggestions of what this might be? Our local vets aren’t the most competent (many times she will admit that she doesn’t know what is wrong with our animals but will do what she can - clinic is also limited in terms of equipment and medicine) but I think she does her best with what she can… so any help or suggestions that anyone can make I can pass on to her.",cryptocurrency,1647175129.0

At the point of closing on Friday, the US treasury bond yield curve is slightly inverted between the 7 and 10, besides the slight inversion the yield curve is generally extremely flat pointing at a high probability for a weak economy in the future if not a recession. The yield curve flattening started already last year but became recently only flatter. The yield curve inversion is known to be a very accurate predictor of recessions.

The eurodollar futures curve 

The eurodollar futures curve, which is a bet on the 3 months libor, started inverting already early last December and is currently inverted from the Dec. 2023 contract. The inversion is only becoming deeper in the later contracts and suggests that there is a high probability that the economic situation in the near future will be such, that the FED will be forced to stop hiking rates, or even has to lower the rates again.

The rising dollar 

Since the lows about one year ago, the US dollar is rising rapidly on the DXY. It is already very close to multi year highs and if it keeps it's momentum we could see levels not seen since 20 years. A rising dollar suggests an illiquid dollar shortage situation which isn't any good for the economy.

The rising oil price

I think this one doesn't need much explanation, but if the oil price it too high it will damage the economy because it will squeeze out the budget of the people causing to less economic activity for anything else. A quickly rising oil price is associated with recessions and this time the oil price is definitely rising very quickly. 
https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/


High CPI prints

Similar to high oil prices, if the CPI rises quickly without similarly high rising wages across all income classes, the people will be squeezed out in their spending for other stuff and services, which is bad for the economy.

I think that's not even everything, but at least an overview of important and usually very accurate indicators pointing towards a recession.

Obviously the war on the top makes things only worse.

personalfinance,Moving out closer to work vs long commute and saving money,"I've gone through various posts regarding this scenario but wanted some opinions on my individual situation.

I'm 23 Male, graduated college last year and recently started a job with $75k income. Currently I live with my parents and don't have any living costs. However, the job is a 1 hour drive away, or 2 hour transit commute. I mostly do the transit commute since it's much cheaper and less risky (the highways near my work are quite hectic). My schedule right now is very tight, I wake up 4:30 AM, leave 5:50 AM, then return home at 7:30 PM and go to bed at 8:30 PM. 

The reason I'm not jumping at moving out closer to work is that I have significant student loan debt, 70k right now, and I've been aggressively paying it off. The interest rates range from 4.5% at the highest to 0% for the federal (for now).

I can get a 1b1b apartment within 20 minutes of work for about $1000 a month, less if I get a friend to move in with me, but that's nearly a quarter of my net income that isn't going towards student loans, plus there would be utilities, food costs, and other living costs that I just don't have right now.",finance,1647197300.0

CryptoCurrency,I am from EU and I support the PoW ban,"Lets get this straight, if there is a better alternative, why not use it?

Some con arguments I've seen:

""Where do we draw the line? Should we ban gaming PCs as well?""

Yes. In EU we already regulate the amount of power various electronic device can use, and I do not see a problem with regulating those either.

If you think it is fine to use 10x as much energy just to achieve a higher FPS on latest game, when you could use an alternative that is almost as good where your eyes can hardly perceeve the difference for a fraction of the energy used, this is something that should be concidered.

""PoS is not as safe/decentralized...""

Oh please...

The main PoS layer 1s will be just as decentralized as BTC as the adoption gows.

It is 2022, we have layer 1 solutions using PPoS which are not even carbon neutral but carbon NEGATIVE.

And they are secure. They run without issues for years. 

They are unforkable.

They are faster and more reliable than BTC.

It is time to start using a better alternative, for the environment, and for the end users.

""In PoS money rules!""

So does in PoW! The same way. The richest people can buy the most of the processing power.

PPoS is more resiliant to 51% attack than your BTC PoW.

""PoS is not real crypto!""

What does that even mean? PPoS is an iteration on the technology that is vastly supperior to what Satoshi envisioned when they created BTC.

If Satoshi had the knowledge we have today, they would probably make BTC based on PPoS.",cryptocurrency,1647199348.0

personalfinance,Credit in a high inflation environment,"Hi All, I've been thinking about credit use where I live (Non-US, Non-EU) and I wanted to tap into your collective knowledge to see if I'm thinking straight. Here's the situation:

* Official inflation rate: %54. Real rates are reported to be above %100. 
* Credit rates are kept artificially low by the government, around %27 APY for a car, and a bit lower for a mortgage. (fixed rates)

We have a decent amount saved up, and invested in broad stock market ETFs. Decent salaries, saving about %50 of our household income.

My question is, looking at the low real interest rates, I feel that using as much credit as I can for assets seems to be a good idea. Anything that's expected to keep up with inflation like RE etc. In a year or so the fixed payments will have eroded with the inflation.

I work in tech hardware and regularly need to go into the office, so moving to a cheaper area and going full-remote is not an option. How should I approach saving based on my financials below?

**Retirement Savings**

401k: $210,000

IRA: $48,000

Emergency Fund: $35,000 in savings

**Income &amp; Expenses**

Gas: company gas card

Phone, Internet, Misc: $250

Tuition: $800 (company reimburses remaining tuition. the advanced degree tracks me for engineering management)

WASH­ING­TON—The cryp­tocur­rency in­dus­try has staked out a spot at Wash­ing­ton’s re­volv­ing door, hir­ing scores of for­mer gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and reg­u­la­tors as it seeks to shape poli­cies to gov­ern the largely un­reg­u­lated mar­ket.

Those work­ing for or ad­vis­ing cryp­tocurrency firms or in­vest­ment funds in­clude three for­mer chairs of the Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion, three for­mer chairs of the Com­mod­ity Fu­tures Trad­ing Com­mis­sion, three for­mer U.S. sen­a­tors, and at least one for­mer White House chief of staff, for­mer Trea­sury sec­re­tary and for­mer chair of the Fed­eral De­posit In­sur­ance Cor­po­ra­tion. 

The Tech Trans­parency Project, a watch­dog group, has iden­ti­fied more than 200 for­mer staffers of fed­eral agen­cies, con­gres­sional of­fices and na­tional po­lit­i­cal cam­paigns who have worked in crypto. They’ve gone to com­pa­nies such as Coin­base, Cir­cle and FTX, ven­ture-cap­i­tal funds such as An­dreessen Horowitz, law firms rep­re­sent­ing cryp­tocur­rency clients, and crypto-fo­cused trade as­so­ci­a­tions.

The push comes as reg­u­la­tors are scram­bling to craft rules to pro­tect in­vestors in the cryp­tocur­rency mar­ket and safe­guard against il­licit ac­tiv­ity or fi­nan­cial in­sta­bil­ity. Pres­i­dent Biden on Wednesday signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der task­ing fed­eral agen­cies with a broad re­view of cryp­tocur­ren­cies.

“You just don’t nor­mally have in­dus­tries this new ac­cu­mu­late this much hard and soft power in Wash­ing­ton,” said Jeff Hauser, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Re­volv­ing Door Project, a pro­gres­sive group. He noted that lob­by­ing ac­tiv­ity and po­lit­i­cal spend­ing by crypto firms have surged along­side the re­cruit­ing of for­mer gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials.

For­mer SEC Chair Mary Jo White, now an at­tor­ney at De­bevoise &amp; Plimp­ton LLP, is de­fend­ing cryp­tocur­rency is­suer Rip­ple Labs Inc. against an SEC en­force­ment ac­tion. Ms. White ran the SEC dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion. For­mer Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Lawrence Sum­mers ad­vises crypto in­vest­ment firm Digi­tal Cur­rency Group Inc. and sits on the board of Block Inc., a fi­nan­cial-tech­nol­ogy firm that is in­vest­ing in cryp­tocur­rency-pay­ments sys­tems. For­mer act­ing Comp­troller of the Cur­rency Brian Brooks, mean­while, is chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of bit­coin-min­ing firm Bit­fury Group, and briefly worked as CEO of Bi­nance.US, an Amer­i­can af­fil­i­ate of the gi­ant global ex­change. 

To­tal com­pen­sa­tion pack­ages for for­mer of­fi­cials in the cryp­tocur­rency in­dus­try can reach into seven fig­ures, a per­son fa­mil­iar with sev­eral hir­ing arrange­ments said, while reg­u­la­tors top off around $250,000. For­mer of­fi­cials who go to cryp­tocur­rency-fo­cused com­pa­nies or in­vest­ment funds can also ne­go­ti­ate po­ten­tially valu­able long-term in­cen­tives, such as stock op­tions or a slice of prof­its known as car­ried in­ter­est. 

Two re­cent events have fu­eled the hir­ing push.

The first was a re­al­iza­tion in the in­dus­try fol­low­ing the 2020 elec­tion that cryp­tocurren­cies probably wouldn’t re­main un­reg­u­lated for­ever. While the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in­cluded a num­ber of out­spo­ken cryp­tocur­rency sup­port­ers, most se­nior Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have ex­pressed skep­ti­cism of the as­set class.",cryptocurrency,1647226249.0

Expenses: rent, groceries, bills, CC payment #1 (set to pay off within 1.5 years) , CC payment #2 (shared CC to pay off accured balance w/ partner within 1 year)

I have 30k in federal student loans, $11k personal cc,  and a credit score hovering 695-702. I am looking to build up this credit score within the next 5 years and onwardto ideally be in a decent spot for a possible first home/rental property investment with my partner.

My main question is whether getting a secured or multiple secured CC's to utilize for my subscription auto pays would have a significant impact on my credit score?

However what is the ""root cause"" that set things in motion some time ago? I am here to cast a light on this issue, as it is often forgotten because humans are bad capturing long term effects that only really become apparent after some delay.

[So here is an article about how the current out of control inflation started with the Federal reserve](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/28/inflation-interest-rates-thomas-hoenig-federal-reserve-526177) 

Some excerpts:

“Inside the closed-door FOMC meetings, quantitative easing was debated during 2010 for being what it was — a large-scale experiment that carried unclear benefits and risks. There was more opposition to the plan than was publicly known at the time. Hoenig wasn’t the only FOMC member with strong objections to the plan. The regional bank presidents Charles Plosser, Richard Fisher and Jeffrey Lacker expressed concerns about it, as did a Fed governor named Kevin Warsh. 

The Fed’s own research on quantitative easing was surprisingly discouraging. If the Fed pumped $600 billion into the banking system in roughly eight months, it was expected to cut the unemployment rate by just .03 percent. While that wasn’t much, it was something. The plan could create 750,000 new jobs by the end of 2012, a small change to the unemployment rate but a big deal to those 750,000 people.

There were many downsides to the plan, but the risks all played out over the long term. The primary worries were the ones Hoenig pointed out, about risky lending and asset bubbles. But there was also concern that quantitative easing could create price inflation, encourage more government borrowing (because the plan worked by purchasing government debt) and that it would be very difficult to end once it began because markets would become addicted to the flow of new money.

\[…\]

Fisher, the Dallas Fed president, said he was “deeply concerned” about the plan. “I see considerable risk in conducting policy with the consequence of transferring income from the poor, those most dependent on fixed income, and the saver, to the rich,” he said at the time.

\[…\]

For Hoenig, the most dispiriting part seems to be that zero-percent rates and quantitative easing have had exactly the kind of “allocative effects” that he warned about. Quantitative easing stoked asset prices, which primarily benefited the very rich. By making money so cheap and available, it also encouraged riskier lending and financial engineering tactics like debt-fueled stock buybacks and mergers, which did virtually nothing to improve the lot of millions of people who earned a living through their paychecks.”

If this angers you the best thing to do is to learn more about these processes. You need to understand what the ""big guys"" are doing and how it affects you. Otherwise you can hardly see if a financial policy is good or bad for you if changes are proposed.",finance,1647230510.0

Bitcoin,Anyone arguing about Bitcoin's energy consumption understands neither Bitcoin nor energy. Bitcoin's energy use is a function of its value. The network algorithmically resolves the exact amount of energy (work) required to secure that value at any given time.,"&amp;#x200B;

[Satoshi's PoW timechain is a timeless marvel](https://preview.redd.it/k68lxufsecn81.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4367583baf3038796b776ede2228c271bc60208)

What's the fundamental problem with fiat money Satoshi, and cypherpunks at large, sought to fix? Trust. For two reasons specifically,

1- Centralized, focused issuance and control of money supply and monetary policy

2- Trivial cost of issuance

While issuance entails no cost, money remains at the mercy of the basest of human qualities, self-seeking greed. All corruptive tendencies of fiat money are a direct consequence of the trivial cost to issue infinite money.

Satoshi’s proof-of-work algorithm solved this problem by implementing an ingenious cost of issuance algorithm that keeps every actor honest and forever scales in proportion to Bitcoin’s value as a monetary network —higher Bitcoin's value, higher the cost of issuance, and vice versa.

In PoW, Wealth != Power

My node = your node = president's node = pope's node

Someone else may have more bitcoin, but it doesn't allow them any privileges or power over you.

PoS reintroduces trust, locus of power, and easy money. Preminers/large stakers become central banks.

Bitcoin will NEVER, not today, not in 100 years, use ""too much energy.""

Bitcoin is [Dymaxion money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion)—maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input.

They keep telling you Bitcoin would be top 30-40 for energy consumption if it were a country. What they don't mention is by value of money in circulation, Bitcoin is #14.

Energy required to secure USD - 6691 TWh/yr ([military-industrial complex](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/Pentagon%20Fuel%20Use%2C%20Climate%20Change%20and%20the%20Costs%20of%20War%20Revised%20November%202019%20Crawford.pdf))

Energy required to secure BTC - 79 TWh/yr

Bitcoin secures 3.5 times as much value per TWh as USD and emits 57% less GHG per USD value secured. These figures will only improve as Bitcoin becomes more valuable.

To be clear, this is not meant to justify the comparison. You can't compare Bitcoin to anything else, not companies, not countries, not fiat currencies. There's nothing like it. It's only meant to debunk the mainstream climate sophistry.

In case this wasn't obvious, we progress as a civilization using more energy, not less.

We're still a Type 0 civilization. How do we get to Type 1?

By overcoming central powers ([Klaus Schwab](https://youtu.be/tItp_2lGKqU)) preoccupied with selectively stifling innovation to arrogate more power unto themselves &amp; figuring out how to harness all energy resources available to us on Earth.

Bitcoin is the key to unlocking that energy potential—by subsidizing the transition to renewables, tapping remote/stranded resources, mitigating CH4 emissions from O&amp;G, stabilizing grids and accelerating humanity towards securing a clean, energy abundant future.

A higher intelligence would laugh at us should we squander the opportunity.

stocks,WDC- the biggest bargain on the market right now,"Western Digital(WDC) is one of the largest providers of data storage devices. Unlike their Rival Seagate, Western digital is heavily diversified in everything from Hard drives to solid state drive, as well as enterprise storage products.

Right now the stock is down 33% YTD as part of a broader decline of tech companies, and concerns over semiconductor supply chain issues.

In terms of value, currently, the stock is trading at 52 week lows. WDC is trading at a P/E ratio of 7, a price to sales of 0.75, a price to book of 1.18, and a market cap under 14 Billion. The 10 year low of WDC is $29, suggesting little downside.

In terms of growth, the growing demands of the cloud creates a consistent need for storage. There is tremendous demand, and right now the biggest barrier to growth is supply chain issues. So while WDC is a cyclical company, there is evidence to suggest that demand will remain strong for years as their customers address their supply chain issues.

As interest rates rise in the coming months, companies with excessive debt are at risk. Fortunately, Western Digital has been making tremendous progress in reducing its leverage over the past few years, and has a very healthy balance sheet, with a debt to ebitda ratio of 1.5.

The progress made in paying down debt puts Western digital in a good position to re-instate its dividend or conduct buybacks in the next few years. The dividend was suspended in 2020 to focus on reinvesting in the business and in paying down debt, but would be re-evaluated when the company is below $6 Billion in total debt and $3 Billion in net debt, a target that the company is on track to reach in the next few years.

I make ~150k/yr. My current Mortgage has 256k left on it, for a 30 year term(recent refi) at 2.5%. Current principle/interest is 1k

Zillow (unreliable, I know) says my house is worth 492k. Actual comps in the area are selling form anywhere from 450-550, so 492 is probably in the ballpark.

So, 236k-300k equity. 

Houses in the area that are reasonable size/quality upgrades that we would be interested in are 600-650k. 

* 600-300 = 300
* 650-300 = 350

so 50-100k greater than my current mortgage. minus closing costs on both houses etc.

Unfortunately interest rates are up since my re-fi, so will eat some cost there too.

We recently met with her family's tax preparer, someone her family has been seeing for years and who she began going with to see when she started her business. I had always used free online filing from one of the usual companies, but since we married a couple years back, I started going with her.

Her income varies, but mine is consistent. I was hired in April 2020 at my current job, making $13/hour. I was promoted to manager in July that same year (to fill the position from the former one quitting), bumping me to a $35k salary. I did not receive any further raises for a whole year and a half, until the end of 2021, which bumped me to $36k. 

For taxes in 2020, we received around $700 for a refund, which we were gratefully surprised to get (we expected to break even at best). I believe the tax preparer said my withholding was at 7% that year. For tax year 2021, however, we basically broke even (actually a $10 refund but at that point, it doesn't matter), and I found out that my withholding was only at 3% - actually closer to 2.5% from my own raw math (withholding in 2020 was over $1500, but in 2021 was only just over $800). I did not request that my federal withholding be adjusted at any point, and there were no significant events that occurred in the entirety of 2021 that could have auto adjusted that (if that's even possible - again, tax novice here).

Our tax preparer recommended a 10% withholding. He said that, if it was set to that, we would have received around $2500 for a refund. My wife and I have been struggling to make it by as it is, since most of our income comes from me, and that refund would have saved us from a handful of financial grievances. We were not relying on that, don't get me wrong - she and I have never relied on tax refunds for anything, but when we were informed of the circumstances and what we missed... a part of me perished. I admittedly did not pay attention to my withholdings for the year 2021 (I do now), and I understand that is my fault and my fault alone, but considering that I never requested the change, I was not expecting this outcome. I assumed the withholding percentage was the same as before. 

The tax preparer shared his thoughts that he suspects my employer reduced my withholdings so that it would not cost them as much to give me a raise (and instead is coming out of my own pocket), but the problem with that is the occurrence doesn't coincide with any of the two raises I received, so I don't know how true that is. I don't WANT to believe that's the case... I really like my boss and my job, but I feel betrayed, and I think it goes without saying that I've been brutally mentally and emotionally damaged by this, so much so that I've been seeking better employment elsewhere, but that's hard to do in my industry (mobile device repair).

I don't know what I should do. I don't know what TO do. It is technically my money, and technically I still received it, so I don't know if anything can be done. I mean, I do know at minimum I need to have HR change my withholdings ASAP, but is there anything else that can be done, aside from finding a new job?",finance,1647297242.0

personalfinance,"I have a loan I should be paying for the next 4 years, but maybe it could be less?","Hi there, so I have a loan for 7.700.000 Chilean pesos (CLP), roughly 9.400 USD. Part of it was to furnish my husband and mine's first apartment, another to buy our first car, another for our wedding and another to consolidate credit card debt. The biggest part is the car. The interest rate is 1,49% monthly and I have liability and unemployment insurance on it. The monthly payment is 257.506 CLP, starting April, with a total of 48 payments. The total prepay cost is 8.911.972 as of right now.

Though the loan is in my name, the debt is shared with my husband. Currently, my husband is unemployed due to health reasons, but he's started looking for work again. He has his own debts as well and he's doing Uber to stay on top of those. We've agreed I wouldn't charge him for the loan for three months, so he can pay those off.

I make 1.623.981 CLP a month after taxes, of which about 1.065.502 goes to monthly expenses. After paying the loan I have 300.973 free. I pay everything and then my husband pays me back, but currently, he pays what he can. Technically per month, he should transfer me 402.250 (half of the rent, loan, and other expenses), or 273.500 without considering the loan, and we would take turns with groceries, but last month he could only transfer 100.000 and get small batches of groceries, for example.

My credit card debt right now is 181.642 CLP and 197,82 USD, which I'll pay the first week of April in full. So I probably won't have any free money that month. I have 1.991.298 CLP in investments, which I don't plan on touching until it starts going up again.

My salary before taxes is 1.852.400, which is adjusted yearly (last year it was 1.745.900), but taxes are also increasing progressively until it reaches 17% (this year the tax is 12,25%, last year it was 11,5%). This is because the law doesn't recognize me as a dependent employee, but I have to pay pension contributions since 2 years ago. Part of what I pay I get back in May, but it'll be a smaller percentage each year (not sure what that % is), and that'll go to pay my yearly student debt payment. That all may change next year because I could officially be given a contract because some laws might change, but we'll see.

Anyway, am I okay here or should I try to pay the loan faster than we originally planned? I could definitely pay more than I do now, but my husband can't. Once he has a job again, maybe we could,  but it would depend on his salary and maybe it would be better to put in savings anyway?

I have no idea if I gave you too much or too little information, but I'd appreciate the input!",finance,1647298617.0
personalfinance,401k Asset Allocation Recommendation?,"Greetings r/personalfinance.  I am 30 years old and looking to retire in ~20-25 years.  How would you recommend I invest in the following options offered via my 401k provider?  I know I can just pick a target retirement fund and call it a day, but I sort of want to try my hand at doing this myself.  


Also, secondary question...would you recommend choosing a traditional or roth 401k?  Both are offered via my provider.  
I already have a Roth IRA that I've been contributing to for many years.  
Thinking about doing a Traditional 401k here, though not sure which would be best (I understand the difference between the two, I just have no idea if I'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket by retirement--currently in the 22% bracket). I also have a traditional 401k from my previous employer that I'd like to roll over.  
Thanks for any insight/advice you can share.

stocks,"""Three steps and a stumble"" rule, how many steps have happened?","Hi.

I hear that there's a rule ""Three steps and a stumble"", where if the Feds raise something three times in a row, then a crash is imminent.  How many steps have been made so far, and if they raise rates on Wednesday will that be the third step?

Some definitions describe each step as just rate hikes, but hasn't the Fed increased rates several times this year already?  Hasn't that been three consecutive steps so far?

Other definitions say that each step is a ""discount rate"".  Another definition says each step is target rate, margin requirements, or reserve requirements.  And then I hear it's got something related to the bond market.  It's not clear to me what I should be looking for each step to be.

For the ""Three steps and a stumble"" rule, how many steps have happened already and what constitutes a step?  Will a projected rate hike on Wednesday cause the third step?  I'd like to know if a crash is imminent, thank you.

EDIT:  I also hear there's a ""Death Cross"" happening now, how worried should I be?  Thank you",finance,1647303013.0

personalfinance,What options to select for my new 401(K)?,"Hello everyone! I'm 33 and planning to retire at around 50-55. I recently started a new job with some new 401(K) options. I have two funds in my current 401K and I am planning to rollover my 401k into my new employer plan so I need to determine what funds I should choose to replace them. I currently hold the following funds:

* VTIAX (Vanguard Total International Stock) (Brokerage)
* VTSAX (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund) (Roth IRA &amp; Brokerage)
* VFIAX (Vanguard 500 Index Admiral) (Previous 401K)
* VTNGX (Vanguard Developed Markets Index Fund) (Previous 401K)

They are currently split with 78% US/22% international between my accounts with no bonds.

I am planning to rollover my current 401K into my new employer's 401K plan. They do not have the VFIAX or VTNGX funds so I need to decide what stock options I want to choose to invest that money into instead.

I went through my new 401(K) options and essentially filtered out anything that is above a 0.30% expense ratio which left only Vanguard funds. These are my options:

* VANGUARD FINANCIALS INDEX ADM (VFAIX - 0.10%)
* VANGUARD HEALTH CARE INDEX ADM (VHCIX - 0.10%)
* VANGUARD LIFESTRAT CONSVGRWTH (VSCGX - 0.12%)
* VANGUARD LIFE STRATEGY GROWTH (VASGX - 0.14%)
* VANGUARD LIFE STRATEGY INCOME (VASIX 0.11%)
* VANGUARD LIFESTRAT MOD GROWTH (VSMGX - 0.13%)
* VANGUARD MID-CAP INDEX ADMIRAL (VIMAX - 0.05%)
* VANGUARD SH TERM FED ADM (VSGDX - 0.10%)
* VANGUARD TREASURY MONEY MARKET (VUSXX - 0.09%)
* VANGUARD TTL INTL STK IND ADM (VTIAX - 0.11%)

I am leaning towards VIMAX and VTIAX. Would anyone recommend any other split? Also unsure on what percentage I should go with them.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my federal student loans ASAP or pay the minimum?,"I am a recent graduate with a good paying job and $10k in student loans at 4.5% interest. The default repayment plan would get it paid off in 10 years, though if I wanted to I could live a bit frugally and get it paid off within the next few months.

I had scholarships throughout undergrad, but I had the opportunity to take out student loans with 0% interest until graduation, so I decided to take the money and invest more. I wasn't taking out that much and I knew I'd be able to pay it off fairly easily after graduating since the median salary in my field is pretty high, so I wasn't too worried. So far it's been a good decision.

The loans have been on forbearance due to Covid so I haven't made any payments yet. However, repayments should be starting in May and I'm not sure if I should just pay the minimum or try to pay ~$2k per month to get them out of the way.

4.5% is in that awkward spot where it's not so low that there's no point in paying it off early, but it's also not so high that it needs to be prioritized ASAP. Over the long run, the market will almost certainly return greater than 4.5%. Also, there's the small chance that the federal government forgives student loan debt so I'd feel really stupid if I rushed to pay it off and then they forgave the debt.

So I'm leaning towards just doing the monthly payments, but I'm not really sure. I'm not that averse to low interest debt and I think that $2k per month would probably be better off in the market. But I'd like to hear other opinions as well.",finance,1647312334.0

Forex,Will GBP/USD be able to bounce this week?,"Unsurprisingly, GBP/USD could be in for added volatility this week with the interest rate decisions due from both the Fed and BOE. 

GBP/USD has sold-off pretty aggressively in recent weeks after the invasion of Ukraine resulted in a break of a short-term uptrend support, as the Dollar rallied on safe-haven flows. This has come despite the market repricing for a tamer start to the Fed’s tightening cycle, but with inflation persisting at record highs, and US PPI and retail sales due before the FOMC Meeting, there is still scope for the US central bank to surprise the market. 

The pair is currently hovering just above the key psychological level of 1.3000, and its ability to bounce or breakdown from here will likely depend on which central bank appears more hawkish come the end of the week. 

A surprise hawkish Fed, accompanied by the situation with Russia threatening to escalate further, is likely to see USD extend its gains. On the other hand, if both central banks remain in-line with expectations, and tensions in Eastern Europe show signs of easing, it could encourage GBP bulls to step back into the market, allowing the pair to bounce from its current levels.

personalfinance,Buying a Home - very anxious.,"So, I read plenty of posts on here, yet I am still feeling very nervous about my next steps. 

Recently spoke to a loan officer. Based on combined income of ~132k, my fiancé and I are looking to buy a home at a price point of 550k. We have a down of roughly 48k. The loan officer suggested we look into home at 570-590k mark maximize our buying power. However we want to keep the mortgage around 3k all in. This way if one of us loses a job, we aren’t desperate or distressed. 

Our biggest concern with buying now rather than later is the rising interest rates. We have the opportunity to continue to save roughly 2.5/3k per month for a year. 

So question 1) is it smarter to buy now while interest rates are low, with a lower down payment and fairly high purchase price in an unknown future housing market. Or risk the interest rate increases, save more for a down, and possibly buy when the market cools off? Please note as first time buyers we qualify to liquidate some of our 401k’s (40k pre-tax) to increase our down with No early removal penalty. This is also a nerve racking idea. 

Question 2) does a 3k mortgage make sense for our combined salaries? Few details, my car paid of no debt. Fiancé 16k left on car loan and roughly 7k in student debt. Debt is on hold pending loan freeze resolution.

Also— it seems in the last five years (SPY history) the middle/end of March has a downturn then some solid recovery at least until end of April / beginning of May, before more uncertainty brews before the next FOMC.

I don’t want to miss out on the potential upturns, particularly if the aforementioned factors come into fruition and we see that V Shaped recovery.

I’m thinking perhaps to buy back, and either sell again end of April and perhaps even, hold and if necessary sell some covered calls again as we get into another possible downturn as we head into the May FOMC.

I know there will be opinions on both sides— but essentially the question is (while of course so many macro economic factors)- is there another just huge overriding reason that this will continue to go down (unlike the SPY of the last five years during the period)?  

Some that are experienced have also said that the indexes actually go up during the interest rate hikes (and it is during the period of uncertainty before hikes it goes down).

Also it seems at some point after the death cross has been met, that is often the low point and up from there.

I feel many of you are far more experienced than me on this, and some of you have been through in the past, so curious to thoughts !",finance,1647329891.0

personalfinance,Would an adjustable rate mortgage make sense for my situation?,"My s/o and I have been putting in offers on homes in our area for a few months, with the rising interest rates being a significant motivator. We finally got an offer accepted yesterday on a condo in a great location for us. 
Our issue is, mortgage rates went up significantly yesterday as well and our lender didn't allow rate locking. Tangibly speaking, our payment would be about $150 more per month than if we'd been able to buy even a day earlier, putting us fairly close to our maximum budget. 
It being a condo, we were thinking of it as much more of a ""first home"" than a ""forever home"", and would likely outgrow it in 5-8 years. At that point we were thinking we'd either sell it or try to rent it out. After speaking with my lender, we found that a 7/6 ARM would be about $300 cheaper per month for the first 7 years, while allowing us to either invest more or get more equity on the home. My question is: I always hear guidance never to go for the adjustable rate, but does it make sense in my situation? It takes away some peace of mind for knowing we're locked into a payment and forces us to refinance or sell by year 5-6, but for something we weren't planning to stay in forever anyway it seems like a sensible way to save money after the latest rate increase.

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone! Definitely unfortunate that I wasn't able to lock a better rate since it sounds like that's uncommon, but it's nice to have confirmation that the higher rate is better than the alternative.",finance,1647343864.0

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed in early volatile trading as oil prices slide further below $100](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/14/stock-futures-rise-slightly-as-wall-street-awaits-fed-rate-hike-ukraine-developments.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures posted strong gains early Wednesday surging in commodity prices eased while the war in Ukraine continues.
*****
&gt; Stock futures were stable as oil prices continued to drop further below $100, boosting hopes energy prices won’t drag the U.S. economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; Futures were held back in volatile trading as traders continued to eye the latest with ceasefire negotiations in Ukraine and China Covid lockdowns that could wreak havoc on tech supply chains. Investors were also reluctant to commit capital ahead of a big Federal Reserve monetary decision Wednesday, where the central bank is expected to hike rates for the first time since 2018.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded marginally higher. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Earlier in the session, futures were down slightly.
*****
&gt; Oil prices continued to fall for a second day. U.S. crude futures slid about 8% to $94.55 per barrel, after topping $130 about a week ago. Meanwhile, the international Brent benchmark was down than 7% to $98.46 per barrel.
*****
&gt; The drop in oil prices put pressure on energy stocks. Occidental Petroleum fell more than 5%, while Schlumberger and Halliburton each lost more than 4%.
*****
&gt; Airline stocks got a boost in the premarket. Delta Air Lines rose about 4.5%, while United and American gained more than 3%.
*****
&gt; The city of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, announced a 35-hour curfew that starts at 8 p.m. local time following Russian missile strikes. Russia and Ukraine were also set to continue talks Tuesday, following a fourth round of negotiations Monday. Meanwhile, Russia is approaching a series of deadlines to make payments on its debt.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, officials from the United States and China met on Monday to discuss a range of challenges facing their bilateral relationship, including Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.
*****
&gt; China is also facing its worst Covid outbreak since the height of the pandemic. Shenzhen, a major city in a key manufacturing hub in China, has shut down nonessential businesses and imposed city-wide testing.
*****
&gt; “The market is jittery,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management. “So much concern about the Russian invasion, inflation, and the Fed. With growing concerns of a bear market, investors have been skittish.”
*****
&gt; Still, he added he doesn’t feel a bear market is in the cards, saying fundamental data support a solid economic base.
*****
&gt; # Fed meeting kicking off
&gt; The Federal Reserve is slated to kick off an important two-day meeting Tuesday, with investors expecting a quarter-point rate hike to be announced Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Mounting inflationary concerns will weigh on the Fed meeting. A lockdown in China could worsen supply chain issues, after a surge in coronavirus cases suspended production in cities such as Shenzhen, a key manufacturing city. The Russia-Ukraine conflict had already led to a spike in commodities prices.
*****
&gt; “With both of these factors driving prices higher, the government has no choice but to increase rates to absorb the inflation that is accelerating,” said Benjamin Tsai, president and managing partner at Wave Financial Group.
*****
&gt; There also will be adjustments to the economic outlook, projections for the future path of rates and likely a discussion about when the Fed can start reducing its bond portfolio holdings.

personalfinance,Advice on What to Pay Off First,"I think I know the answer to this, but I guess I just need some re-assurance that I am making the right decision:

I found out that I am going to receive a bonus from work today, and after taxes it will leave me with approximately $5,000.00 left (given that I've only been with the company for 4 months, I'm thrilled with this amount). 

I'm going back and forth in my head with some debts in my head and what to pay off:

1. $3,700 - Private Student Loan, Variable Interest (11.5%), monthly payment  around $77.00
2. $2,100 - Credit Card on hardship plan, 0% interest, monthly payment of $134.00
3. $2,500 - Credit Card on hardship plan, 0% interest, monthly payment of $142.00 
4. $2,200 - Active credit card, 26% interest, monthly payment of $50.00 (Note - I am not paying this card right now -- I took this card out to help my parents out, and they are currently making payments on it. But it would be a nice gesture to get rid of it). 

Part of me wants to pay off 2 and 3 because that will free up almost 300 bucks a month, or pay off at least one of those and then help my parents out with #4 (they've already told me not to, but 26% is BULLSHIT).  But that variable student loan hanging over my head is terrifying me...especially with the interest rate discussions happening. 

Another part of me wants to stash the whole thing in case something happens. If I pay the student loan off, I can definitely put the rest in savings too. So there's a plus to that. 

I'm 99% sure that paying off the student loan is the best decision....but I guess can I just get some reassurance? Or other ideas that may benefit me better?

He theorized that they want to keep their gravy train by transition to cryptocurrency specifically bitcoin. And it makes sense given the abrupt about face their stance on crypto has taken lately, as well as their moves to grab hold of exchanges, create bitcoin ETF'S, and regulate the market AKA rig the game in their favor. He also has some interesting ideas about property in a world where rules and laws are being eroded as well at the beginning. Pretty much you only really own that which you can defend. 

Also breaking in case you didn't hear about this shit show the LME (london metals exchange) halted trading for nickel futures this week after the prices went parabolic and has yet to resume trading. All because 1 chinese billionaire (LME is owned by china) was caught with his pants down in a naked nickel short so massive that would have ruined him, and now he wants to double down his short position.  And his counter party?...JP Morgan chase of course. (They are *the devil* ) 

So the LME halted trading and instituted a new rule where any 15% swing in price would halt all trading, which would be fine if we weren't in the middle of a game. People have long position contracts who would have never bought them if they knew this would happen, and who have lost a great deal of money due to trading suspension because of 1 whales short position. 

So the LME is finished as a valid commodity exchange and if not it's reputationally tarnished forever, and now the MOEX (russia) and Shanghai exchanges will be the dominant commodity exchanges instead of London and chicago...exactly what the chinese and the russians would want right? Probably the plan all along and why china bought up the LME in the first place. Also looks like the LME will no longer offer futures on nickel at all soon. 

Are they going to change the cryptocurrency trading rules in such ways? Are the days of massive gains over if they do? These are questions long time holders of crypto should be asking themselves but I don't really see us doing that very often. 

Keep a close eye on what the federal reserve, wall street, and the government are doing folks because this LME debacle *could* be us very soon.

That's all for now

CryptoCurrency,Now that we are moving into a 'war-lite' economy there is a very real possibility that the short term economic plan will be altered significantly and the fed might just undo that entire decision,"Title says it all, as we all know by now at the end of 2021 the bomb shell of rising interest rates rocked the stock markets and ruined the crypto field as large investments were sold to pay off debts and to move into safer investments with the prices corrected accordingly.

However, now that we are moving into a war-lite economy the long term health of a countries finances are going to be far down the list of priorities with short term growth significantly preferred. This is doubly true with the sanctions causing a heavy hit to cost of living for the average person and cost of operation to businesses.

This said we might just see the fed throwing down a significantly lower interest adjustment, or none at all in the next few hours. If that does happen, and they even start up the good ol' money printers again, we could potentially see the charts go straight up as the large investors scramble to get back into the market having left for reasons that didn't come.",cryptocurrency,1647351627.0
Bitcoin,Interesting response to my email regarding the EU vote yesterday (in German translated to English).,"&gt; Dear Mr. Simplelifestyle,
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you very much for your email.
&gt; 
&gt; As I have already expressed on social media, a new attempt in the ECON Committee (Economic and Monetary Affairs) around a de facto ""Bitcoin"" ban took place in Brussels on Monday:
&gt; 
&gt; Here, however, one is not so clumsy to bring it as - in Canada - under the guise of ""fighting terror"" against their own, government-critical citizens in position.
&gt; 
&gt; Here, the hunger for energy and thus the problematic classification under the aspects of the so-called ""GreenDeal"" was advanced in order to deprive the cryptocurrencies, which are based on the ""proof-of-work"" technology, of legitimacy. A corresponding sanction would be tantamount to a de facto bitcoin ban in the EU.
&gt; 
&gt; Fortunately, a liberal-conservative majority was able to stop the ban and thus put a stop to the project, which was promoted by the SPD and the Greens, for the time being.
&gt; However, this does not end the matter. Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a problem for the ban fanatics in Brussels - but mainly because the disastrous monetary policy of the ECB and the economic policy of the EU are becoming increasingly clear through it.
&gt; 
&gt; Except debts make and money print Lagarde, von der Leyen and Co. nothing comes to mind!
&gt; 
&gt; They, as part of a rich elite, have also hardly problems or restrictions with the methodology of the money supply increase. But the normal citizens feel more and more clearly where the journey is going when they see the prices in the supermarket or at the gas station.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot simply be ""reprinted"" at will; it is also as anonymous as cash, and that, too, is a problem that Brussels would like to see eliminated. After all, one would like to see the transparent citizen who, in addition to his state of health, will in future also have to disclose his asset status and perhaps also prove his loyalty to the line through social points.
&gt; 
&gt; We continue to stand up for them in the name of freedom!
&gt; 
&gt; Yours Christine Anderson

inflation,Will Central Banks Try to Escape Inflation with Central Bank Digital Currencies?,"Joe Biden signed an executive order to investigate cryptocurrency. This included evaluating the potential of issuing a central bank digital currency. 

Do you know what CBDCs are and the impact they could potentially have on the financial system? This can potentially be a method that central banks worldwide deploy to stop hyperinflation. If a central bank's digital currency is deployed, they would have FULL access to your money and could technically ""burn"" some of the CBDC supply to reduce inflation. They could even set limits, which the FED LITERALLY stated in their Central bank digital currencies research report.

In my most recent video, I explain how a CBDC works, what it would mean for us, and how we can potentially make money if one is issued.

personalfinance,"Future planning with excess income, new marriage, etc","Hi all, got married &lt;6 months ago and wife and I are doing pretty well for ourselves so I'm looking for ""best practices"" for what to do with our ""extra"" money. Here's a quick breakdown:

* I'm late-30s, she's mid-30s. US-based in a state/metro with a very reasonable cost of living
* I've got about $350-400k in a combination of Roth IRA, Traditional IRA (rollovers from previous 401ks), current 401k, a ""high yield"" savings account (used to be almost 2% but now under half a percent interest rate i think?), and a brokerage account that is almost entirely index funds; I've got \~20k in my checking account from a nice bonus i just got from work.
* Wife has probably about the same/slightly more in total but does not have a Roth, has a LOT in her HYSA, and has a lot more in her checking acct because she also got a(n even bigger) bonus from her employer. She's also got a trust from grandparents that has a required annual distribution (something like $2k). We have a joint checking account that also is well-funded at the moment
* We both max out our 401k contributions; we're above the income phase-out for Roth IRA; I now max out HSA contribution and have told her to start doing the same. 
* We've owned a home (30-yr mortgage) for 1.5yrs and have a great rate and a low payment
* We have no outstanding debt with the exception of her car payments, which are comparably low and low interest rate (&lt;2% i believe)
* We have no kids yet, but probably would like to have 2 within the next 5 years

So with maxing out 401ks and HSAs, my thought is to continue putting ""extra"" money into my brokerage account and just keep pumping index funds and other various ETFs, mutual funds, etc. Should I be looking at a ""backdoor Roth"" setup? Should we start a 529 for our theoretical future kids? Other tax shelters? Smart investment moves? Pay off her car? Pay down our house? Buy real estate? Go on vacation??

**Another God-damn post. When will Safemoon stop being so dodgy so I can take a freakin' break?**

Safemoon has a 10% tax on every transaction. 3% goes to a liquidity pair to facilitate transactions. 2% is burned. 4% is reflected to holders and 1% goes to the ""Treasury fund"", which is basically free money for the developers who have mastered the art of the slow-rug, now sucking on the withered teat of the 600,000 or so holders painfully down on their investment. 

---

That 4% reflections? It's divided up proportionally - the more Safemoon you own, the more reflections you get. It's very 'rich-get-richer' but this isn't unusual in the Crypto space (see: staking) however, there's a slight sneakiness surreptitiously surrounding solitary specialist's Safemoon sacks.  

**That is to say: Some fuckin' shady shit going on with Dev-wallets.**  

If the wallets with the lion's share of tokens receive the largest proportion of rewards, is it fair that the developer-owned Safemoon Treasury wallet also receives reflections? Looking at the following link, you can see that this wallet does **NOT** pay tax on transactions it makes, yet it **DOES** receive reflections.

Now here's the *really fun* part. This wallet holds **$34,480,000** in Safemoon at time of posting. As it receives $13,000 a month in reflections, that means it generates 0.0378% of its balance as a monthly ""Interest"" payment. Using an APR converter or Savings Interest calculator, you can plug in those numbers and discover, much to Safemooner horror, that it works out as a yearly interest rate of just.............

personalfinance,Credit Debt Payoff Options,"Trying to work out the best way to tackle some credit card debt. I have about $9,800 across 3 cards but all 3 are charging above 15% interest rates, one over 20%. My monthly income is about $3200 take home, which does not include a 401k contribution through my job. Since I do not want to continue paying the super high interest on the cards, I have narrowed it down to 2 options:

A debt consolidation loan (got a quote with Upstart for a $11,000 loan, 3 years @ 9.78% APR, with no early payoff fees) and factoring this into my other monthly expenses leaves me with about $950 cash for daily/personal expenses once all my other bills are paid.

The other option is I have about $12,000 in an investment account that is starting to rapidly diminish due to the state of the economy right now, and I can access that cash in roughly a week. This is NOT my 401k but I would still take a hit next year when it comes to paying capital gains taxes that I'd rather avoid paying.

Does it make sense to pull out all the money that I have in my investment account and pay off all of the credit card debt I have, and eat the capital gains tax - or do I take out a personal debt consolidation loan and pay off the debt that way and keep my investment account?

We opened the year 4796 and we're at 4242, a 554 point/11.5% drop

To get to 3800 would be another 442 points downwards, which is 10% from where we are now (would be 20.7% overall)

We all knew that with the fed raising interest rates, stock valuations were due to come down. More expensive debt (if the company is using leverage/debt to grow, which most are?) = more revenue/income/cash flow spent on servicing debt = less profits posted each quarter = lower EPS. According to https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html, we will most likely see interest rates be within the range of 1.5% - 2.25% by December 2022. 

Oil seems to have come back down almost to pre-Russia/Ukraine war numbers. Light crude oil futures (CL1!) were at $92/barrel on February 24th. Currently sitting around $98 (down from their highs of $123). About a 6.5% increase. Granted, $92 wasn't a great price either, with oil mainly trading between $65-$85 for the year prior. If oil stays high... that's obviously an issue since it is responsible for so much of how the global economy works. 

Rising interest rates, high oil prices eating into consumer spending power, inflation as a whole eating into consumer spending power, geopolitical conflict in Ukraine/Russia, fed slowly tapering the amount of bond/MBS purchasing they have been doing to remove the extra liquidity + ""artificial propping up of value"" from those markets, residential real estate home supply crunch keeping most regular people away from being able to purchase a home, therefore increasing demand for rent, increasing rental prices as well.

If this subreddit allowed polls, I'd do a poll. What are the chances the markets hit 3800? A geopolitical war in Ukraine/Russia got us 11%... my thinking is... that's it? Is the worst of it behind us? Will the markets keep trending/ticking higher like they always have?",finance,1647365438.0

Powell also stated in the recent hearings that there can be multiple globally backed currencies. To me these signs of doubt coming from a chairman of the federal reserve is alarming.

CryptoMarkets,People aren't fully aware of how to profit from the cryptocurrency phenomenon.,"This post may be aimed at newcomers, so don't slam it if you're a seasoned pro. People I've seen simply trade or invest in these. When they lose in a dip, they declare crypto to be a fad. You can simply stake, lend, or mine cryptocurrencies, but this is a completely different procedure. Here are some unusual ways to earn money.

• Investing in Currency That Pays Dividends
Buying and holding dividend-paying tokens is one of the simplest and most hassle-free ways to make passive income with cryptocurrency. It's worth noting, however, that not all digital currencies pay out dividends, so do your homework before investing.
At the moment, exchanges are issuing the majority of these dividend-paying digital tokens. NEO and Cosmos are two examples of cryptos that pay dividends.

• Put your money in a savings account that pays interest.

While investing in cryptocurrency can help you profit when prices rise, depositing your funds into interest-bearing accounts can help you earn a higher return on your crypto assets. Many platforms now provide this service to investors, and the majority of them also include other features to help you get the most out of your crypto assets.
Some platforms offer high interest rates of up to 12.73 percent, calculated on a daily basis. Preferred Interest Payout and Token Swap are two features on the platform that allow users to earn and receive in the currency of their choice.
If all of this is still too much for you, you can simply use some crypto projects in your daily life and be rewarded with cryptos. You've probably heard of a brave browser that does something similar.


PKT Cash is another project similar to this where you can Turn Bandwidth Into Income.PacketCrypt, the world's first bandwidth-hard proof of work, is used by PKT. When you connect your home or office internet to the PKT Network, you can earn PKT Cash (PKT). That's my take and I would love to see if you have a better option that you experienced yourself.",cryptocurrency,1647378570.0
stocks,The current sentiment makes me think stocks might rally,"I've been in the market during three significant downturns: dot-com (teenager with a custodial Etrade account), 2008 and 2020.  In all cases, the bottom was when people took worst-case scenarios as given.  They all thought it was obvious things would go lower, and even if they were buyers, they prefaced comments with statements like ""I'm just going to keep buying all the way to the bottom.""  No one thought things were about to go up.

Somehow, we're at that point right now.  It is somehow clear to everyone that things are bad and are going to get much, much worse.  That sort of sentiment makes me think we are in for a rally.  When markets have been on the edge of an actual cliff before, the prevailing view was things wouldn't get that bad, valuations weren't too crazy, known risks were less serious than some thought, etc.

My view: The economy is stronger than some people believe, we don't have a recession, oil prices won't go as high as some think and the sell off will be viewed as a buying opportunity in retrospect.  There are still some stocks that I think will fall further (no- or low-earnings tech), but significant parts of the market are not particularly expensive relative to earnings, especially when interest rates are accounted for.

economy,Say hello to Russian gold and Chinese petroyuan,"It was a long time coming, but finally some key lineaments of the multipolar world’s new foundations are being revealed.

On Friday, after a videoconference meeting, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and China agreed to design the mechanism for an independent international monetary and financial system. The EAEU consists of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus and Armenia, is establishing free trade deals with other Eurasian nations, and is progressively interconnecting with the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

For all practical purposes, the idea comes from Sergei Glazyev, Russia’s foremost independent economist, a former adviser to President Vladimir Putin and the Minister for Integration and Macroeconomics of the Eurasia Economic Commission, the regulatory body of the EAEU.

Glazyev’s central role in devising the new Russian and Eurasian economic/financial strategy has been examined here. He saw the western financial squeeze on Moscow coming light-years before others.

Quite diplomatically, Glazyev attributed the fruition of the idea to “the common challenges and risks associated with the global economic slowdown and restrictive measures against the EAEU states and China.”

Translation: as China is as much a Eurasian power as Russia, they need to coordinate their strategies to bypass the US unipolar system.

The Eurasian system will be based on “a new international currency,” most probably with the yuan as reference, calculated as an index of the national currencies of the participating countries, as well as commodity prices. The first draft will be already discussed by the end of the month.

The Eurasian system is bound to become a serious alternative to the US dollar, as the EAEU may attract not only nations that have joined BRI (Kazakhstan, for instance, is a member of both) but also the leading players in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as well as ASEAN. West Asian actors – Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon – will be inevitably interested.

In the medium to long term, the spread of the new system will translate into the weakening of the Bretton Woods system, which even serious US market players/strategists admit is rotten from the inside. The US dollar and imperial hegemony are facing stormy seas.

**Show me that frozen gold**

Meanwhile, Russia has a serious problem to tackle. This past weekend, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed that half of Russia’s gold and foreign reserves have been frozen by unilateral sanctions. It boggles the mind that Russian financial experts have placed a great deal of the nation’s wealth where it can be easily accessed – and even confiscated – by the “Empire of Lies” (copyright Putin).

At first it was not exactly clear what Siluanov had meant. How could the Central Bank’s Elvira Nabiulina and her team let half of foreign reserves and even gold be stored in Western banks and/or vaults? Or is this some sneaky diversionist tactic by Siluanov?

No one is better equipped to answer these questions than the inestimable Michael Hudson, author of the recent revised edition of Super Imperialism: The Economic Strategy of the American Empire.

Hudson was quite frank: “When I first heard the word ‘frozen,’ I thought that this meant that Russia was not going to expend its precious gold reserves on supporting the ruble, trying to fight against a Soros-style raid from the west. But now the word ‘frozen’ seems to have meant that Russia had sent it abroad, outside of its control.”

Essentially, it’s all still up in the air: “My first reading assumed that Russia must be doing something smart. If it was smart to move gold abroad, perhaps it was doing what other central banks do: ‘lend” it to speculators, for an interest payment or fee. Until Russia tells the world where its gold was put, and why, we can’t fathom it. Was it in the Bank of England – even after England confiscated Venezuela’s gold? Was it in the New York Fed – even after the Fed confiscated Afghanistan’s reserves?”

So far, there has been no extra clarification either from Siluanov or Nabiulina. Scenarios swirl about a string of deportations to northern  Siberia for national treason. Hudson adds important elements to the puzzle:

“If \[the reserves\] are frozen, why is Russia paying interest on its foreign debt falling due? It can direct the “freezer’ to pay, to shift the blame for default. It can talk about Chase Manhattan’s freezing of Iran’s bank account from which Iran sought to pay interest on its dollar-denominated debt. It can insist that any payments by NATO countries be settled in advance by physical gold. Or it can land paratroopers on the Bank of England, and recover gold – sort of like Goldfinger at Fort Knox. What is important is for Russia to explain what happened and how it was attacked, as a warning to other countries.”

As a clincher, Hudson could not but wink at Glazyev: “Maybe Russia should appoint a non-pro-westerner at the Central Bank.”

**The petrodollar game-changer**

It’s tempting to read into Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s words at the diplomatic summit in Antalya last Thursday a veiled admission that Moscow may not have been totally prepared for the heavy financial artillery deployed by the Americans:

“We will solve the problem – and the solution will be to no longer depend on our western partners, be it governments or companies that are acting as tools of western political aggression against Russia instead of pursuing the interests of their businesses. We will make sure that we never again find ourselves in a similar situation and that neither some Uncle Sam nor anybody else can make decisions aimed at destroying our economy. We will find a way to eliminate this dependence. We should have done it long ago.”

So, “long ago” starts now. And one of its planks will be the Eurasian financial system. Meanwhile, “the market” (as in, the American speculative casino) has “judged” (according to its self-made oracles) that Russian gold reserves – the ones that stayed in Russia – cannot support the ruble.

That’s not the issue – on several levels. The self-made oracles, brainwashed for decades, believe that the Hegemon dictates what “the market” does. That’s mere propaganda. The crucial fact is that in the new, emerging paradigm, NATO nations amount to at best 15 percent of the world’s population. Russia won’t be forced to practice autarky because it does not need to: most of the world – as we’ve seen represented in the hefty non-sanctioning nation list – is ready to do business with Moscow.

Iran has shown how to do it. Persian Gulf traders confirmed to The Cradle that Iran is selling no less than 3 million barrels of oil a day even now, with no signed JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement, currently under negotiation in Vienna). Oil is relabeled, smuggled, and transferred from tankers in the dead of night.

Another example: the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), a huge refiner, just bought 3 million barrels of Russian Urals from trader Vitol for delivery in May. There are no sanctions on Russian oil – at least not yet.

Washington’s reductionist, Mackinderesque plan is to manipulate Ukraine as a disposable pawn to go scorched-earth on Russia, and then hit China. Essentially, divide-and-rule to smash not only one but two peer competitors in Eurasia who are advancing in lockstep as comprehensive strategic partners.

All the blather about “crashing Russian markets,” ending foreign investment, destroying the ruble, a “full trade embargo,” expelling Russia from “the community of nations,” and so forth –that’s for the zombified galleries. Iran has been dealing with the same thing for four decades, and survived.

Historical poetic justice, as Lavrov intimated, now happens to rule that Russia and Iran are about to sign a very important agreement, which may likely be an equivalent of the Iran-China strategic partnership. The three main nodes of Eurasia integration are perfecting their interaction on the go, and sooner rather than later, may be utilizing a new, independent monetary and financial system.

But there’s more poetic justice on the way, revolving around the ultimate game-changer. And it came much sooner than we all thought.

Saudi Arabia is considering accepting Chinese yuan – and not US dollars – for selling oil to China. Translation: Beijing told Riyadh this is the new groove. The end of the petrodollar is at hand – and that is the certified nail in the coffin of the indispensable Hegemon.

Meanwhile, there’s a mystery to be solved: where is that frozen Russian gold?

personalfinance,Paying off your mortgage early makes no sense,"I've seen this over and over and over in this sub. So let's breakdown why you should not do this in this environment of sub 4% interest rates.

1.You are less secure from emergencies.

Having paid off more in your mortgage does nothing to insulate you from financial emergencies. It is likely the least liquid asset you have. In an emergency, you will not want to quickly get a HELOC (home equity line of credit) to access liquid cash. And with a HELOC, you expose yourself to having a variable interest rate as opposed to these historically low fixed interest rates. In a financial emergency, you still have to pay your mortgage. You can't do that with prior early payments. The lender wants their monthly payment. The city wants their property tax. The house still needs maintenance. You can't pay for any of that with being years ahead in your mortgage. The lender will foreclose. The city will serve you a summons. Your roof can leak.

2. You pay a huge opportunity cost.

Paying off more to your mortgage means you now have less cash. That cash could be invested easily in areas that historically return much more than your mortgage interest rate. And that investment can be easily accessed quickly if you are simply using a brokerage account. 

3. You are less psychologically secure.

This one may sound weird. Wouldn't having no mortgage make you feel more secure? It is easy to think that, but read bullet point 1 again to disabuse yourself of that notion. There is nothing more secure than having cash in hand. Cash flow while you pay your mortgage will be better if you don't pay extra. That means you will have more cash in hand, which means you'll be able to be much more flexible in your decisions and react faster to any emergencies. No mortgage payment sounds secure? An extra 50k in the bank, now that's security. You can use that cash to pay for any emergency and continue to pay your mortgage if you lose your job. That flexibility is the ultimate security. 

Let's do a quick analysis of how much this can affect you. Let's use a common piece of advice to basically pay an extra mortgage payment per year by paying half your payment every 2 weeks, which leads to basically paying 13 payments a year instead of 12.

Let's say your house was 500k and you put down 20%. So you have a loan of 400k, and you have a 4% rate for a 30 year mortgage. Very standard stuff. Mortgage payment would be about $1910, with the extra payment per year, it is the equivalent of a $2069 mortgage payment ($159 more per month).

After 15 years of prepayment, you have paid an extra $28600 to your mortgage. That money, invested and returning 6% on average, would be $46865. That is 2 full years of mortgage payments that you could make if you lost your job, just by not paying extra payments. And you did it all so you could be, after 15 years, 2 years ahead on your mortgage (about $40k more paid to the principal). Obviously, this compounds even more drastically the more you prepay.

Don't pay extra on your mortgage. It doesn't make any sense.",finance,1647386868.0

inflation,Inflation and Amazon,"Amazon posted eps of $27/share for Q4 ‘21. Of this $27 eps, rivian gains accounted for $24/share. Therefore, all of amazons aws and e-commerce business earned a measly $3/share in Q4. For the past 4-5 quarters, amazons operating income has been getting decimated by inflation throughout every step of the logistics chain that is Amazon. If Amazon has to take a loss on rivian because it’s share price is about a quarter of what it was, I guess you could assume the hit to earnings would be negative -$12 per share? Is that how it works? Now if rivian has a negative impact of -$12/share, and in Q4 the eps from the rest of its business was only $3 eps, if Amazon makes as much in Q1 from e-commerce and aws, wouldn’t that leave it with a Q1 ‘22 of -$9 eps? Just as they’re lapping a quarter with like $16 eps from last year? That would leave them with a differential of negative -$25/share. That -$25/share hypothetical comes right out of the $67/share they earned all of last year. The PE ratio is going up, so are interest rates and inflation.

personalfinance,Capital gains on rental real estate,"I've reviewed prior questions and didn't see this spelled out. I'm calculating what we owe on our recent sale of a house for quarterly estimated taxes due April 15. My confusion is on the mechanics of how federal cap gain rates are applied.

I understand the basics on how to calculate the gain: basis (original price+improvements-depreciation) - closing/selling costs. I know precisely what the gain is based on that formula. It's a sizeable gain based on holding a house in a now hot market for 2+ decades. 

**Where I'm confused is** that our income places us in the 15% cap gains bracket. But when I use  H&amp;R Block tax software (mocking up a 2022 tax return), it seems to be adding the total gain from Schedule D in with our ordinary income. That obviously taxes us at a much higher rate. We're filing MFJ and are clearly in the 15% range for cap gains. 

I understand that NIIT tax is 3.8% in addition to federal capital gains taxes. I'm just not understanding the mechanics of how cap gains are taxed at that lower rate via the 1040 and Schedule D.

investing,rates vs quantitative easing,"There is a lot of talk about raising interest rates, but little talk of unwinding quantitative easing. Why wouldn't the fed fully unwind quantitative easing first before raising rates?

Raising rates now but waiting until summer to even start unwinding quantitative easing is obviously intentional.

History says that quantitative easing was implemented because rates were already close to zero, and yet the fed still wanted to do more, so why are they keeping quantitative easing while at the same time that they are raising rates?

This subreddit is a joke. After multiple replies hearing how i was wrong, I found this podcast from Bloomberg which backs up my main point:

Logically I’d expect the price to take a hit in the wake of the Fed announcement. But maybe it won’t. Maybe people will pour all their money into BTC because of inflation. Maybe dogecoin will become the new number 1 currency.

Anyway, such intraday spikes we see as a fake rise, so looking at the intraday chart, it still looks like a correction within a downtrend, so watch out for a bearish resumption ahead of the critical Fed meeting today.

EUR/USD and BTC/USD are connected and in positive correlation since November 2021. If we consider that EUR/USD has room for more weakness within an extended wave (5) to complete wave 5 of (5), BTC/USD could be easily headed lower out of potential bearish wave (4) triangle pattern into wave (5) towards June 2021 lows.

CryptoCurrency,Why shouldn't you just put all (most) of your fiat into a stablecoin to actually make money?,"I do not see why it would be a bad idea to 95% abandon banks and USD in favor of storing cash in stablecoins.

As it stands, interests rates offered by banks are a complete joke, I almost don't even know why people look at them. I currently have two banks, each with an interest rate of 0.25% and 0.5% The latter is Ally Bank, which used to be well-known as a bank with high interest rates, with no BS account requirements to go along with it. That's about as good as it gets now for just a simple savings account.

Factor in inflation, which has accelerated to over 7% this year. You are actually losing money, because inflation is outpacing the interest rate of every bank out there. Even on a ""normal"" year, where the inflation is only about 2%, and banks offer you a few more pennies in interest, you're still losing purchasing power.

Now, compare this with what some of the exchanges are offering on stablecoins. I was looking at Gemini's GUSD, which is now confirmed to be backed by the US dollar. That is an 8.05% APY, and it's not locked in or anything, you can withdrawal whenever. Other exchanges might offer slightly better deals, but this is the best I've seen on mine.

So, why shouldn't I just move 90% of my fiat into GUSD? These stablecoins are backed by the dollar, their price does not fluctuate like BTC. On any given day, I can convert all that GUSD back into USD, $1 = $1, maybe +/- a penny difference. For 8%, I can't see why this is a bad idea. I'll just keep enough money in my checking account to cover expenses, but any excess will be earning interest on a stablecoin.

Obviously, this may not always be the ideal strategy. Interest rates and investment opportunities will change, but right now, in the short-term, this is an excellent opportunity.",cryptocurrency,1647439510.0

stocks,[DD] My personal top 3 solar stocks right now,"Solar stocks had a rocky year in 2021. Overall, the solar stocks market ended the year with a loss of 27% following a jump of almost 240% in 2020. Over the last few weeks, I've been researching the top solar stocks to buy in 2022 and I've found three that I think are a really, really good pick.

# Canadian Solar (CSIQ)

The name probably makes it obvious that this is a Canadian company which specialises in solar panel engineering, production and construction. Founded in 2001, Canadian Solar has grown steadily over the years. In fact, they have one of the biggest solar panel manufacturing capability in the world right now. They are vertically integrated and produce everything from ingots and wafers to cells and complete solar modules. Currently, they have a module production capacity of 22.1 gigawatts and that is expected to increase to 32 gigawatts by the end of 2022. However, you should know that all of their manufacturing is based in China so they can be a bit vulnerable if US-China relations become worse. Still, one trend that is visible in the solar industry is that the top 5 manufacturers are getting more and more market share and Canadian Solar is in the top 5! The other really great thing about Canadian Solar is their focus on battery storage projects. Solar-and-storage projects is what is currently driving the solar industry. These projects include both solar panels and the batteries necessary to store the energy output of those panels. Canadian Solar currently has roughly 21 gigawatts hours worth of battery projects across the world in their construction phase or just in the backlog. Plus, Canadian Solar have a total of 24 gigawatts peak of solar projects around the world, spread between North America, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East, China and the Asia-Pacific region.

One of the best things with Canadian Solar is that their projects are worldwide so they are relatively protected from specific geopolitical tensions although that also means that shipping costs are a big factor with the company. In fact, shipping costs and rising commodities costs is what drove Canadian Solar down in 2021. Key materials went up between 120% and 338% while shipping costs went up 159% during 2021 resulting in overall module manufacturing costs going up by more than 40%! This exposed one of Canadian Solar's weaknesses which is its low profit margin which makes it especially vulnerable to rising prices. However, this also means that Canadian Solar will benefit a lot more from stabilising or falling prices. If we see that, Canadian Solar could shoot up in price. Also, part of Canadian Solar's strategy is to keep parts of its solar projects and sell the power instead of selling the whole farm. That way, the company will have some steady income to balance out its earnings, which is really great and will make them much more financially resilient! Right now, the solar stock trades with a PE ratio of 29.3 and a forward PE ratio of 7.51! Their price-to-earnings-growth ratio is also just 0.6 which is extremely good value! Canadian Solar does have a lot of debt, roughly $2.2 billion dollars which comes up to a debt-to-equity ratio of 107.4%, but it also has a cash pile of $867 million so their financial situation is relatively stable. In my opinion, Canadian Solar is one of the top solar stocks to buy right now although you need to keep in mind that this solar stock is volatile and is correlated to shipping and materials costs so you need to keep an eye on them.

# First Solar (FSLR)

Unlike Canadian Solar, First Solar is an American company with American-based manufacturing (Americaaa, fuck yeaaah!). In fact, that is one of its main competitive advantages over companies like Canadian Solar. First Solar is less susceptible to hikes in shipping prices although the majority of materials necessary for solar panel production do come from China so First Solar does have some exposure to that. The other competitive advantage that First Solar has is the type of solar panels that it produces. First Solar produces solar panels that are better suited for utility-scale solar farms. Their solar panels are also more resistant to weather and have a better production consistency although their maximum efficiency is slightly lower than the panels of competitors like Canadian Solar and Jinko Solar. Still, this makes First Solar a very competitive choice for large-scale solar projects, especially US-based projects. Similar to Canadian Solar, First Solar has a lot of projects in the backlog with a 26.2 gigawatts worth of solar module shipments backlog as of now. With a current manufacturing capacity of 8.4 gigawatts, First Solar has enough projects for the next 3 years! Still, the company is expanding their manufacturing with new factories in India and the US and should reach a production of 15.8 gigawatts by the end of 2024. This does highlight a potential problem though. If First Solar is not able to keep up with the demand, they could start losing business to companies like Canadian Solar which have a much higher production capacity. To me, it seems like First Solar is trying to do a controlled expansion, which is good for their finances, but it can cost them their leadership in the market.

Still, First Solar is one of the most profitable companies in the sector precisely because of their approach. In fact, First Solar had a profit margin of 16% in 2021 and currently have a PE of just 15.9. However, they are anticipating reduced earnings in 2022 due to their expansion plans, but we are expecting to see a jump in EPS in 2023. Their forward PE for 2022 is only 29.15 although that is based on an estimated EPS of $0.41 dollars. The company's guidance for 2022 is an EPS between $0 and $0.6 dollars so their forward PE will probably be very volatile. This is also why I think First Solar may see another dip before the end of the year if they keep seeing increased costs. On the other hand, lower costs will be very beneficial for the stock price. Basically, you are taking a bit of a risk here with material costs. If you think that they will go up, then maybe wait out. If you think they will go down, then First Solar is a good pick. Overall, I think the company will do really well in the next 3 to 5 years. They are a leader in the solar field, they have good operations, they have a net cash position of $1.6 billion dollars on a market cap of $8.1 billion. As long as they manage to keep up with demand and control their expenses, the stock price of First Solar will keep going up.

# Enphase Energy (ENPH)

Founded in 2006, Enphase Energy focuses on designing, developing, manufacturing and selling solar energy solutions in the US and internationally. Enphase Energy's main product is the microinverter which converts DC to AC energy at the solar panel so that the energy can actually be consumed by the end user. In addition, Enphase Energy offer a storage battery in two configurations, 10.1 kilowatt-hour and 3.4 kilowatt-hour. They also offer a portable energy system which is used off-grid and offers huge possibilities in the Indian market. They are also developing Electric Vehicle chargers and fuel cells which are two new, but rapidly growing markets. Overall, Enphase Energy is a leading pure-play solar company with a high-quality product offering and a massive addressable market. In terms of manufacturing, Enphase Energy's main operations are in Mexico and India which was a strategic move to avoid being affected by US and China trade relations and possible tariffs. I think that was a really smart play on their side and shows real foresight from the management. Most solar companies have operations in China because you get cheap labor and easy access to the necessary key materials, but obviously it brings other issues. Enphase Energy's CEO has actually shown really good business understanding and strategic thinking over the last few years and that is really, really important.

Now, unlike Canadian Solar and First Solar, Enphase Energy is actually classified as a growth company. Over the next few years, analysts are expecting an average of 32.9% earnings growth and 20.8% revenue growth which is much, much higher than the rest of the industry and higher than its closest competitor, SolarEdge. Enphase's management is also focused on their 35/20/15 business model which stands for a target of 35% gross margin, 20% operating income and 15% operating expenses. Currently, their operating expenses are a bit higher, standing at 24% overall for 2021 although they have dropped to 16.5% for the last quarter of 2021. However, their operating profit is also higher at 25.4% for 2021 so that's okay. Plus, their gross margin has been steadily improving and currently stands at 40.2%, 5% above their target. Still, that model shows Enphase Energy's long-term plan and it's good to see they have such a plan in place. This is also something that a lot of investors like. Everyone loves predictability when it comes to investing. Enphase Energy is also less affected by commodity price increases and shipping costs than Canadian Solar and First Solar so that's another positive for the company. Still, Enphase Energy is trading at a premium because of its expected growth. Their current PE is 150.7 with their forward PE for 2022 being 50 or 56.8, depending on your source. Their price-to-earnings-growth ratio is 1.41 which is actually a bit lower than the sector median of 1.44, but it's still relatively high. Enphase Energy also has a net debt of $20 million dollars which is tiny given that their market cap is $23.9 billion. Overall, I think that Enphase Energy is a solid bet for the next 3 to 5 years. However, the price is a bit steep right now and doesn't really offer a big margin of safety. Also, given the fact that we have multiple expected interest rate hikes this year, growth stocks like Enphase Energy are likely to be hit with a lower valuation. Basically, my personal opinion which is not financial advice is that I would only buy a small amount of this solar stock and I would look for opportunities to add to my position over this year. Again, I am very, very bullish on Enphase Energy, mainly because of their Indian solar market bet. There are not a lot of companies that are targeting it and it is massive so Enphase Energy have a huuge opportunity there. But, again, I would be wary of going all-in on Enphase right now.

I understand that it is applied to taxes owed but is not given as an actual refund from the IRS but rather rolls over if you don't owe anything.  Is that correct?

We have an LLC. and pay our Federal Income Tax estimates quarterly.  Then when filing each year we either owe some additional tax or typically get some back as a refund because we overpayed.  In order to receive the full 26% federal tax credit, would we be better off not paying the estimates throughout the year and owing when we file taxes but applying this to cover what we'd owe?

For example, we're looking at installing a roughly $80k system on our barn so the Federal Tax Credit would be around $20k.  If at the end of 2022, we pay our estimates and don't owe any federal income tax, we wouldn't be able to get any of the credit back but rather roll over to next year?  Conversely, if we don't pay the estimates through the year and owe $10k, would the FTC reduce that to $0 and rollover the additional $10k to next year?

personalfinance,Trying to determine how to submit my W4s for multiple jobs to minimize refund/pay-in.,"So for this year, I technically have four sources of income.

- 1st Job (Left in early March)
- 2nd Job/Primary (Started in early March)
- 3rd Job/Secondary (Will have the entire year)
- 4th Source (Rental Income)

I'll be filing married jointly, claiming one dependent, and likely using the standard deduction. I max out my 401K and HSA contributions at $20,500 and $7,300 respectively. I'm trying to minimize my refund/pay-in amount for the 2022 tax season.

When I plug in my numbers on the IRS's W4 calculator. It states that I should withhold $139 additional (to a total of $660 withheld federally) on my primary job's W4 whereas for my second job, I should withhold $0 federally. Would that mean that I should submit an exempt W4 for my second job?

To complicate things, my primary job doesn't withhold state income taxes so I would need to submit another W4 for my second job to withhold additional state income taxes. Using an online calculator, I took my AGI and subtracted my state personal exemptions (roughly $13,500 based on my filing status and dependents). Using an online state income tax calculator at SmartAsset, it calculated my anticipated state income tax to be $5,724 (with $53 withheld YTD this becomes $5,671). Right now, only $5 is withheld per pay period, so would this mean that I would need to submit a new state withholding form to withhold an additional $293 going forward to meet that $5,671 tax obligation?

WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and projected its policy rate would hit a range between 1.75% and 2% by year's end in a newly aggressive stance against inflation that will push borrowing costs to restrictive levels in 2023.

In a new policy statement marking the end of its full-on battle against the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. central bank flagged the massive uncertainty the economy faces from the war in Ukraine and the ongoing health crisis, but still said ""ongoing increases"" in the target federal funds rate ""will be appropriate"" to curb the highest inflation in 40 years.

The statement dropped direct reference to the coronavirus pandemic but instead cited the war in Ukraine as creating ""additional upward pressure on inflation"" and weighing on economic activity.

The interest rate path shown in new projections by policymakers is tougher than expected, reflecting Fed concern about inflation that has moved faster and threatened to become more persistent than expected, and put at risk the central bank's hope for an easy shift out of the emergency policies put in place to fight the fallout from the pandemic.

Even with the tougher rate increases now projected, inflation is expected to remain above the Fed’s 2% target, remaining at 4.1% through this year and dropping only to 2.3% through 2024. Economic growth is seen at 2.8% this year, a sharp drop from the 4.0% growth projected in December.

The unemployment rate is seen dropping to 3.5% this year and remaining there next year, but is projected to rise slightly to 3.6% in 2024.

The new statement said the Fed expects to begin reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet ""at a coming meeting,"" a topic likely to be addressed further by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a news conference due to begin at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT).

Would it be better to pay off the loan early? The interest rate is 4.5% so I don't see this saving us that much money. The only benefit would be the eliminated monthly payments (which with another kid coming soon could be nice).

Or do we just save it, add to it, and have enough to buy the eventual next car with cash? We're hoping to make it another 2 years on the current car, but it's already 20 years old.

Or do we do something else with the cash? We have a solid emergency fund ($20,000) already. Investing it at the moment seems a little risky just given the chaos from adding a 2nd child in the mix soon. Thanks!",finance,1647455684.0

personalfinance,Worth it to pay off my car note?,"Hi all,

I recently came into some cash via a life insurance payout and a bonus at work. I have a car loan of a little over $12k that I could pay off. However, I'm not sure if that's the best use of my cash and I'm hoping to get some advice. Here are the details and considerations:

**Loan details:**

\- Remaining balance: $12,497.93 (payoff amount = $12,525.64)

\- Term: 72 months, 58 months remaining

\- No early payoff penalty

\- Monthly payment: $231.21

\- Interest rate: 2.89%

\- Current credit score: 773

**Considerations:**

\- According to a calculator I found, I'd end up saving about $1800 in interest by paying it off now

\- I have no other debt except a couple of credit cards that I pay off monthly

\- I'm not looking to sell or trade in the car anytime soon

\- I am hoping to purchase a condo later this year and have a good chunk already set aside for a 10% down payment plus fees, etc.

\- Just got a decent raise at work, so I'm not terribly worried about cash flow issues in the near future

\- If I do pay it off, I'll plan to transfer the monthly payment amount to a Roth IRA. I already contribute 10% to my 401k, which my company matches at about 3.5% (the matching contribution is maxed out once you contribute at least 6%)

\- I am.. not great with money. Part of the reason I'm considering early payoff is that I'm not great at keeping a budget and am worried that I'll fritter away too much of it, whereas using it to pay off the car would at least ensure it's going towards clearing my debt. (I am seeking out an actual financial adviser to help me going forward!)

**So, among these options, which would you advise?**

\- Pay off car note

\- Sink all $12k into a Roth IRA (or other type of account?) now

\- Contribute my extra $230 monthly to an IRA, or to my 401k (even though I'm already maxing out my employer contribution)

\- Put the $12k in a savings account and forget about it until it's time to buy a condo, use it towards repairs, renovation, add to the down payment, whatever

\- Fritter it away on clothes, vacations and eating out (kidding, kidding)

Thank you in advance!",finance,1647456785.0

personalfinance,Is this cash out refinance worth it?,"I am debating on whether to move forward with a refinance.

My current loan amount is is $765k at 3.25% interest 30 yr fixed.

Recently my home appreciated in value and I thought it would be a good idea for a cash out refi. In late February I was able to lock the same rate 3.25% 30 yr fixed, and the new loan amount would be $937K.

I'll be paying about $15k in discount points and fees, so in the end I'll only be getting about $156K in the cash out, so the principal goes up by about $172K.

I don't need the money, but I thought it would be a good idea to just put the money in some index fund, and it would give me some extra wiggle room in case I lose my job or in the event of an emergency. I am currently in college and will have to pay about $50K in tuition over the next couple of yrs. That will eat up most of my emergency fund.

On the other hand, I don't know if this is a good deal. I'll effectively be paying 10% of the loan amount up front in just fees, but the interest rate seems pretty low compared to today's and not sure if interest rates will ever go back down to this level.",finance,1647459636.0
personalfinance,Options for personal loan for coding bootcamp and cost of living,"I'm planning on taking a coding bootcamp later this year. I know that is heavily urged against on this subreddit, but I have already made my decision and do not need to be dissuaded. I've been learning on my own for the past year, but came to the conclusion that a bootcamp would be best for me. This is a well respected bootcamp, and I know three people personally who completed it and can vouch for it. All three became employed within four months. I realize this is not a ticket to a secure job, but I feel it would give me the best chance to enhance my skills so I am willing to take the risk. What I'm looking for here is advice on taking out a personal loan to fund the bootcamp as well as cover cost of living. 

Some background on me: 

* 27 years old living in HCOL area 
* Currently employed making $85k 
* $90k in retirement accounts and $13k in personal savings
* No debt whatsoever and never taken out a loan before
* Credit score is currently 802

I am looking to take out $23k which would cover the cost of the bootcamp as well as approximately 3-4 months of living expenses. I am planning to quit my job in a few months just prior to the start of the bootcamp. Now given all this information, I expected to get a somewhat decent interest rate for a personal loan (ballpark of around 5-6%). I've applied through almost all of the online lenders, and the best pre-approval interest rates I was given were 9.5% through SoFi and 8.5% through Upstart (both 5 year loans). Both of these also have no origination fee and no early payment fees. Upon receiving the loan, I plan to immediately pay the full cost of the school and then make monthly payments of about $750. Could I expect getting a lower interest rate by applying elsewhere? I've seen credit unions mentioned online several times but I do not really know what they entail or if they are even recommended. Also, because this is a bootcamp and not a college or university, my understanding is that I unfortunately will not qualify for a student loan. Are there other options that are more tailored towards bootcamps? Obviously I'm looking for the lowest interest rate, but also options with no origination fee or early payment fee. **Does 8.5% sound about right** and probably the best rate I can get? If there are any other options such as a loan through the state or federal government, please let me know. 

Thanks for the help.",finance,1647459876.0

personalfinance,Higher Retirement Contribution vs. Higher Salary,"Would appreciate advice about whether it's better to stay at a job with lower salary and higher retirement contribution vs.  moving to a job with a higher salary vs. lower retirement contribution.  My salary at my current job will soon go up to around $80K with a 10% retirement contribution (plus an extra $3,000 to help pay for student loans). The salary at my prospective job would be around $90K with a 4% retirement contribution.  So all in all, it doesn't seem like my total compensation would differ much between the two jobs.  I don't know what future pay raises would look like at the prospective job (although I assume there are annual raises), but my current employer has annual pay raises tied to inflation (unless inflation is really high and the organization has to give a smaller raise).

Assuming other benefits like health insurance, etc. are more or less equal, do you think it's generally better to have a higher salary or higher retirement contribution?  I want to make sure I'm not missing something.

personalfinance,Payroll Deductions for HSA Contributions,"Does anyone know if an employer is required to allow their employees' HSA contributions via payroll to be sent to any HSA that the employee sets up? I am asking because I absolutely hate the employer sponsored HSA account that my employer set up for me but I still want to contribute to an HSA pre-tax through payroll. However, my employers payroll services refuses to allow me to have the payroll HSA contributions be sent directly to my own personal HSA account that I sent up. They are saying they will only allow it to go to their employer sponsored HSA account they set up for me. I find this extremely inconvenient because their HSA account is objectively worse. Just the customer service alone makes me want to cry when I try to call them for help. So, I am hoping that someone would know the law regarding this matter and could tell me if I should pressure my employer further into allowing my contributions via payroll to be sent directly to my own personal HSA account.

*I am sure this will come up so I will address it now. Contributing to my HSA not through payroll means that I have already paid taxes on that money. Those taxes include Federal, State, FICA, etc... Yes, if I were to contribute to my HSA not through payroll(after I got paid from my bank account), I could still deduct or get back the Federal and State Taxes. However, I can not get back the FICA taxes(7.65% for me and employer) and I would also have a higher total income showing up on my taxes which could make me owe more taxes. Anyone who suggests I simply get paid and contribute to my own HSA does not understand the benefits of payroll HSA deductions on one's taxes.*",finance,1647461816.0

i have a lot of money currently invested in USCRX (30% of net worth) and am wondering if it’d be better to slowly ladder out (ex 1/6th per month for the next 6 months) or if i should just sell it all and buy VTI now.

I'm not an analyst, but I think we're in for some more downside.  Who can educate me on this?

What time frames are we looking at here? 

On the one hand, crypto has hit the mainstream with the superbowl ads and retail investment, but I also hear much FUD in the mainstream (Bill Maher, et al) about crypto being a ponzi scheme, or NFTs being mostly minted from other peoples work or straight up a money laundering vehicle, or there's no use case as a currency, and on and on.

I know it's a high risk investment, but as I see my bags dwindle, I'm torn between moving into traditional investments until the bear leaves the room and I can lump sum back in to crypto, or just continuing to DCA.  If the market is going to be flat for a few months/years I'd rather get some gains in an index fund or something, but if we're approaching the bottom, maybe a lump sum now will yield the best gains.

personalfinance,Is aggressively funding a 529 a good move for me right now?,"Hi r/personalfinance

Trying to figure out the best way to save money. My husband and I each max out our 401ks each year and max out our RothIRAs when we don't exceed the income limit from bonuses since combined we are right at the cusp. We have an emergency fund of about a year (could be stretched out for longer). We own a house with a good mortgage interest rate, don't have a lot of expenses, and are generally good savers. We are expecting our first child this summer and I opened a Utah 529 account for her through Vanguard which I've putting $500 a month into for four months. 

I just unexpectedly signed paperwork to sell a rental property in a private sale which will net us a ""windfall"" of about $150k when it's all over with fees paid (luckily no cap gains tax since we lived in the house 2/5 of the last years). I'm trying to figure out how to handle this money since in terms of retirement accounts we are already maxing out tax advantaged options, so ETFs/mutual funds/etc are where I am looking, but one thing I will do with it is pay off my remaining car loan (just about $5k remains, 3.85% interest) which will free up another $500 per month for me. My husband already pays our mortgage and the majority of our bills and I am just responsible for most of our groceries, pet care, medical bills, baby stuff, etc and without having a car payment my savings account will just keep growing and losing value as it sits there (this is why I'm looking into ETF/mutual fund/other investment options for the windfall). 

As long as we can afford it, does it make sense to put $1000 or more into my daughter's 529 each month? I grew up in a situation that was not financially secure and have a lot of anxiety around saving enough money. I want to be better about taking trips and treating ourselves a bit more often instead of saving so much, but fortunately I think I can still do that while also tucking at least that much away each month into the tax advantaged account. Since having any more of a savings account-based emergency fund is just letting our money depreciate in value, to me it makes sense to save it in the 529 instead of just adding it to my shitty ""high yield"" savings account, but I want to make sure I'm not missing a better option.

CryptoCurrency,The risks of Staking/Lending/DeFi/Earning,"I have been using a platform to lend a stable coin for interest back in the same stable coin for a few months. I haven't been lending too much money. As I reevaluate my financial positions, I want to increase the amount I am lending because the banks aren't cutting it. Before I continue, I am NOT trying to bash any of these platforms , but trying to understand the risk before I put more money into them.

Yearn Finance, FTX, BlockFi, Celsius Network, Crypto.com etc have pretty great interest rates for stable coins. From my understanding, if these platforms get hacked or rug pull, everyone loses their money since their platforms are all centralized. Is this correct? So why are people putting money into these platforms where you may get 10-20% interest per year but can also lose a bigger stack of your money.

I understand staking is better. For example ADA offers a 5% return, but then you have the risk of ADA's price falling.

My question is, what platforms are you using? What are their risks and rewards?",cryptocurrency,1647469763.0

personalfinance,401K: Ratios and fees seem high in employer matched 401k? Need advice on how to utilize this account and my new rollover accounts going forward!,"Hey everyone, I am finally done with school and back into the work force and want to make sure I have my accounts situated, and a better grasp for going forward.

I am a 30-year-old male in the USA, single and no kids currently, looking for a target to retire around 2055. I am still fairly new to all of this, so I wouldn’t mind learning, but feel maybe more hands off should be my technique.

I have consolidated 2 previous employer 401ks into fidelity for simplicity, options, and control. They are not currently invested, and want to make sure I invest properly. 

In Fidelity:

Traditional IRA: 0

Roth IRA: 5000

Rollover IRA: 10,000

I was planning on just investing them both into the same FDEWX, fidelity’s index fund for 2055 with ER of like .12, and investing my 6k/yearly into this roth and using the rollover IRA as just a centralized place to keep dumping my 401ks if I go to new employment if the options there aren’t great.

Well, this all sounded great until I looked into my current employer’s 401k options, through Empower Retirement, and I am not sure they are good, and how I should go about utilizing this account. My employer matches about 3.5% so I have that part maxed, but this is where I do not know where to go.

Currently it is all in TRPNX, T Rowe Price’s target fund for 2055, but I looked and the expense ratios, which are .46, plus Empower is charging a blanket 59$/annual administration fee for all accounts. This seems very high compared to the .12 I’m talking about in fidelity for a target fund date.

My options at work will be below, but the question I am now wondering is should I personally change to the lower ER vanguard accounts I see through empower, and if so to which ones and the %s. Or is this current setup not as bad as I am thinking? 

Or do I even use this account outside of the 3.5% match and just do my own 401k things through fidelity, utilizing the accounts I have currently setup? I figured if I am going to have to go through the hassle to learn the spreads here on my employer’s site, should I just go through the hassle on fidelity to mirror my selections and just go that route instead of the original thought fidelity target funds? 

Sorry, that was a lot to unpack, and I appreciate all the help in advance, just looking to set myself up correctly and I know there are a lot of uncertainties in the world, but I just am looking for some guidance.

&gt;**The Fed approved a 0.25 percentage point rate hike, the first increase since December 2018.**

&gt;**Members also pared expectations for economic growth this year and sharply raised their outlook for inflation.**

Overall I think the market has already priced this in and the increase starts as early as tomorrow.  For the long run this is a good for the market I think. I rather the market drops a bit then to see inflation go out of hand.  With that said the Feds job has always been about protecting the economy but not the market so its strange to see in recent years it looks like the other way around.

The is huge as it signifies market sentiment has completely changed. The S&amp;P was up only 2.22% today on news of the fed hike, and since 4 is bigger than 2, I feel confident in saying we have officially decoupled from the stock market. 

I know what you’re thinking- “4% in a day isn’t that big of a change.” And yes, I agree with you, but let’s imagine the market grows 4% everyday for the next year. Because crypto is a 24/7 market, we get 2 days over the stock market. 4% of compounding interest over 365 means $100 investment today could turn into $164,880,329 a year from today. Now that’s wife-changing money!

Why do I think this? Well, the fed stated will continue to increase rates over the next year. From that, I can deduce the market will increase at the same rate over the next year. 

I can’t believe yesterday my wife was telling I was an idiot for losing half of our child’s college money on “magic internet money.” After I tell her that I’ve only lost 40% of the money, she’ll really be eating crow.

And you might be wondering *what am I gonna do? I'm down 15% YTD, that's basically half of last year's return figures.*

Well I have a solution, or more technically, something that I conceived while studying backtests and options data by people much smarter than me.

What's the solution? Selling puts.

I see you rolling your eyes, *this guy thinks he's a genius for discovering CSPs, what a moron.*

Something you might not have heard before is that CSPs outperform in both bear and stagnant markets. So while in the last couple years CSPs have underperformed relative to growth stocks, *when not if* the market reverses the pendulum will swing back towards CSPs outperforming.

[https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4882&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4882&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)

If you read the article, you can also note another important thing on page 50. CSPs also realize a much lower standard deviation, in fact, it happens to be **50% lower** when compared to the S&amp;P 500.

So what does it mean when you match the annualized returns (or sometimes slightly outperform) the overall index while also having a lower standard deviation? We lower the Sharpe ratio! Which makes our portfolio have better risk adjusted returns.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we get to my twist. If you sell CSPs on the index you get better risk adjusted returns, but what if we now want to raise our returns to a point where we have the same risk exposure as the overall market?

We concentrate our holdings. Rather than holding the entire index we hold less stocks, which increases our standard deviation, but at the same time should also raise our returns. Now I may have lost some of you at this point saying to shy away from indexes, but bear with me a little longer.

*We don't need 500 stocks to be fully diversified.*

According to this article where they randomly picked stocks within certain indexes and then calculated the standard deviation based on the number of holdings, *the ideal number of holdings for large caps is between 15 and 26.*

So that's the sweet spot, we find high yielding CSPs on blue chip stocks inside already built indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and then pick between 15-26 of them to improve our returns.

&amp;#x200B;

Conveniently, I've built a handy tool in Python that screens for these options within the indexes (which you can find in my post history [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/lzklj8/i_created_an_options_screener_for_csps_and_ccs/))  that uses Robinhood's unofficial API. I more recently rebuilt the whole project again using Python again, but this time with TDAmeritrade's API which is actually made for pulling options data.

So using that tool, I'm gonna lay out five CSP option plays that I would make for the next month.

**Sell GPS $13P 04/14/2022 for $22 to capture a 1.69% ROI**

Carmax is a retailer of used cars. With new cars suffering awful supply chain shortages, most people will be buying from sites like this for awhile. PE ratio: 14.2 PB ratio: 4.47

**Sell F $14P 04/14/2022 for $21 to capture a 1.5% ROI**

Ford is coming up with some great new vehicles. Their Mustang Mach-E gave Tesla a run for their money and they won't stop there. Their sales are also way up from where they were. PE ratio: 3.79 PB ratio: 1.76

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to note, the prices at which I say to sell this options are subject to fluctuation, if you try to sell them on market open tomorrow the prices most likely will have changed. If you want to know if the option still offers a good ROI just take the option contract price and divide it by the strike prices times 100. Then just convert that number to a percentage.

I need a car, but am poor. I could likely afford 10% down on a &lt;$8k, used car, and have a good credit score from my credit card, so I'd hope to get a 4% interest rate at worst. I'm assuming they'd need proof of employment, so I'm planning on getting a part time job while I get my career situation sorted. Sadly, an uber to and from the mall I'm considering is $55 total, so I'd want to get the auto loan asap since each shift would pay about $100. 

Anyways, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I need a &lt;$8k auto loan soon with a reasonable interest rate that would be willing to accept a minimum wage, part time job as proof of employment. The first few shifts would be just to get the paystub to get the loan since most of the money would be going to the ubers. I'd get a $2k car, but my gut is telling me that's riskier since you could easily get a lemon, and be out $2k since any random craigslist seller can ghost you with ease. I'd rather get a camry or something with 150k miles on it and 1 past owner for $5k so that if I maintain it properly I can have it for the next 4 years or so. 

This is getting pretty long so I guess what I'm wondering is, how hard would it be for someone in my position to get an auto loan?

CryptoCurrency,The difference between APR and APY and why staking and lending matters.,"When you deposit bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with several exchanges, you can earn interest. When looking for the best interest rates, consider whether the rate is an annual percentage rate (APR) or an annual percentage yield (APY). The distinction is small, but significant, especially when dealing with big volumes.

NOTE: ROI is not measured in months, weeks, or days. They are expressed on a yearly basis.

The APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the rate at which interest is accrued on your initial deposit. It's basically the return you get after a year of lending or staking an asset. The APR number does not take that interest into account if you allow it to compound, rolling the interest into the initial amount, so you're earning interest on your interest.

The APY, or Annual Percentage Yield, is the rate of return on an investment after compounding interest is taken into account. It takes into consideration the interest you're earning on that payout. Because the interest has already been considered into the APY, you won't receive any further interest on the interest.

So where does staking or lending come in? Well the two are different too.

Staking is when you lock up your cryptos and earn passive income while also assisting in the security of the blockchain. As a result, you don't have to do anything and can earn money passively by staking. This is similar to bank interest, but with a significantly higher APY.

Lending on the other hand is where you lend your cryptocurrency and receive interest. Counterparty can do anything it wants with it, and hopefully it will be repaid at some point. You can do this with [centralized companies](http://haruinvest.com/), you can lend them your coins, they pay you interest.

If you own crypto, I strongly advise you to stake and/or lend it out to get a passive income. The income you earn through staking and lending is significantly larger than anything a bank can offer in today's financial system. Why not increase your passive income by staking or lending your cryptocurrency? The more the merrier.",cryptocurrency,1647505811.0

personalfinance,Refinance car loan and take cash,"Since the used cars market is at high, my car's current value is more than what I originally bought it for.

I am thinking to refinance my current loan(4.5% interest), taking cash, and investing it in stocks.

Cash = Current car value - remaining principal amt.

That way I can get more cash in advance and ROI should be higher than my new interest rate( 2-2.5% probably). I know there is a beta factor(risk), which I am willing to take.

Thoughts?
Is there any alternative to take advantage of the used car market without actually selling the car?",finance,1647506151.0

Anyways, my knowledge isn’t great considering I work for a f500 IT company. But he has started investing in SVN-MMF liquidity pool, and the interest rate is like apy 100,000, Apr 733. If he was to leave his money in the compound interest, within a year, granted the coin doesn’t rug pull or fail, even if it goes down 90%, he is absolutely laughing…

stocks,$TEAM: extremely overvalued?,"The stock had a massive relief rally which might continue for a couple of days. 

I am interested in the opinion of value traders here. The company is unprofitable. 

Simply Wall St did a valuation analysis on the stock and found it to be 35% undervalued! Well, what did they do wrong? They used cash flow without subtracting stock based compensation which is huge!

In the last 12 months, net income =-500 million 

Stock based compensation... = 500 million. Stock based compensation imply future diultion of shareholders.  

It is hard to value an unprofitable company but here is what I did: 

I took their operating income (assumed they are making 100 million instead of  losing money 500) and grew it at 30% for 5 years, and 20% for the following 5 years, and gave it a P/E of 20 in 2032. 

I only discounted at 3% interest rate ... and I get: $**25 Billion ...** 

Extremely generous assumptions since grow rate has been declining at a pace that suggests it will be growing at 20% instead of 30% in 2-3 years. 

The company is currently value at $**71 billions**

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Thursday morning, following back-to-back days of sharp gains, as investors digested the latest news out of Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 100 points, or about 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Kremlin poured cold water over reports that indicated progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, according to Bloomberg News.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Financial Time reported that both countries had made “significant progress” on a peace plan and Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. That FT report helped stocks rally for a second day Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was also digesting the latest moves from the Federal Reserve. The Fed hiked its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018 and signaled six more hikes this year, spurring a relief rally in stocks.
*****
&gt; The Fed also significantly raised its projections for rate hikes and inflation in 2022, but investors appear to have taken those aggressive changes as proof the central bank was taking the rise in prices seriously.
*****
&gt; “The dot plot shows they’re behind the curve, and we all know they’re behind the curve, and they’re trying to fix it,” said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors. “At least they’re telling the market ‘we’re trying to fix it.’”
*****
&gt; Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, said on “Closing Bell: Overtime” that he expected markets to rally between now and the next Fed meeting in May after selling off sharply to start the year. He pointed to recent high readings on the Cboe Volatility Index, often called Wall Street’s fear gauge, as a sign that the selling had gone far enough, at least in the near term.
*****
&gt; “When the VIX gets above 35, I don’t care how bad the tape looks, I don’t care how bad the geopolitics look, you’re supposed to get more bullish, not more bearish. And you get an oversold bounce,” Gundlach said.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow rose 518.76 points, or 1.55%, for its first three-day winning streak in more than a month. It was also the Dow’s second straight day gaining more than 500 points. The S&amp;P 500 gained 2.24%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.77%.

stocks,Amazon closes $6.5 billion deal to acquire MGM,"Amazon.com Inc. has closed on its $6.5 billion acquisition of the MGM movie and television studio, the company said Thursday.

The move comes after Amazon certified to the Federal Trade Commission that it had provided all the information requested by antitrust investigators reviewing the deal. That step put the deal on a regulatory clock with the agency that has now expired, leaving the company free to move forward, a person familiar with the matter said.

Amazon provided the FTC with more than three million documents over the past eight months as part of the review process, the person familiar with the matter said.

Even though the deadline has expired, the commission would still have the ability to challenge the acquisition later, if a majority on the FTC votes to do so. The five-member commission is currently split 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans, with one vacancy. A President Biden nominee for the open seat remains pending in the Senate. An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment.

Is there any downside to taking the 72 for the flexibility of being make smaller payments, especially if I intend to pay it off early anyway?

If you have a reasonably large portfolio, why would you hold on to, e.g., 6 months of expenses in cash?  If you suddenly need some emergency cash, just take a margin loan -- the interest rate on that loan is going to be less, on average, than the opportunity cost to holding cash.

I realize that this can be dangerous if you are using a large amount of margin, but if you keep it below, say, 10% at worst, then is it really that big of a deal?  Are there any posts, websites, papers, etc. that discuss this tradeoff?",finance,1647533035.0

Because we are about 5-7k below the federal poverty line we get SNAP and Medicaid

this leaves me with a monthly output of -

750 - rent (I am 4 months ahead on this though) our house is rent to own through my inlaws and is about 1/2 paid off with insurance and taxes rolled into the mortgage (5 years to go)

\------------------------------------------

400 - savings (I put 200 in per paycheck) which will more than pay for all our bills next year (my yearly bills aside from rent only come to about 3500 total (leaves us with savings at the end of the year of about 2200)

\-----------------------------------------------

My food budget on EBT is about 450 a month (I normally use it as 900 every 2 months) and we have a Costco cashback plan, so it pays for itself over the year. (we don't use quite that much in food cause we buy in bulk at Costco and with no meat, our budget is lower than some)

We also get stuff like dog food and paper products there as well. which normally all in all comes to about 150ish for a 2 months

\-------------------------------------------

Our insurance is fully covered by Medicaid (including limited dental and vision) 

\----------------------------------------

I work from home so the only gas we use is normally going to Costco every 6 weeks or so (we fill up there because it's normally way cheaper than anything else in our area and the occasional local store run for small things.

So I am working on a clearance thing and needed to get my loan numbers for my federal student loans since they defaulted.  At the same time I was like hey I should be a responsible adult and ask about rehabbing my loans.  I understand  the loans are no interest but fixing my credit would be worth it.  

My debt is around 6500. My wife and I made about 138000 last year.  The quick estimate amount the person told me was that I couldn’t rehab since my monthly payment would be around 1100 for rehabilitation and would be paid off before the 9 month period is up.  Hence rehabbing wouldn’t help.  Is this right?  At the same time she offered to settle the loan at 90% which I don’t want to do because of well why settle when payments are frozen.  

So we want to buy a house this year since we make actually a bit more than last year and having a current defaulted loan would probably not be ideal.  What would be my best course of action.

Was she wrong about rehabilitation.  The rule seemed weird that if it’s paid off early I’m not eligible.  But if I’m not I’m not.

For buying a house should I pay off the loan now.  I have the full amount in my savings?  Will this impact my ability to buy if it still has debt?  Would settling it be a smart move or will settling it be worse on my history.  She said it would show up as paid in full.

personalfinance,"How can I combine bills from multiple credit cards into one ""account"" to pay off at once?","First off, I'm not looking for a way to refinance my debt (at least in a practical sense). I pay off the entirety of my credit card bills each month. However, I have my finances set up in a bit of a unique way and am looking for a way to pay off all my credit card bills each month with one payment.

I don't really use a checking account, and instead try to keep all my money in a high yield savings account (Marcus by Goldman Sachs). I do this to earn interest on the entirety of my money at all times instead of keeping money in a checking account that essentially earns no interest. This works well since all my spending is done through credit cards. I have all my credit card payments linked to my savings account. But, you're only legally allowed to withdraw from savings 6 times per month. I have 3 credit cards at the moment, so that equates to 3 withdrawals per month. Then I transfer my rent money to my checking account just before my payment each month (the 4th withdrawal). So most months, I have 2 withdrawals left over (unless I transfer money to my IRA, or an unexpected expense, etc). I'm thinking about getting one or 2 more credit cards, but that'd be putting me in less comfortable territory. I don't want to find myself in a scenario where I need to make a withdrawal but have already used up all 6.

So, is there some sort service/tool/etc. where I can consolidate my bills and pay off all my credit cards with a single payment? That would make everything simpler as I could then use one withdrawal for all my credit cards instead of 1 withdrawal per credit card. I'm not looking for anything that has any added expense to it. As mentioned, I don't live above my means and always pay off 100% of my credit card spending, so I don't really care about interest rates. Any suggestions?

Some background on my current finances:

Salary - $60k (I made right around $100k last year including my bonuses)

Student Loans - All federal loans around $45k - interest rates vary from 3.5%-6.5% and there are about 10 different individual loans.

CryptoCurrency,Billionaire Jeffrey Gundlach would rather buy bitcoin than gold,"Jeffery Gundlach, Investor and CEO of Doubleline Capital, says he would rather buy bitcoin (BTC) for the short term than gold since bitcoin is currently very low. Bitcoin rose on March 16 to $41,717 following the Federal Reserve's announcement on raising interest rates.

&amp;#x200B;

The Fed decided to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018. In doing so, they are following the example of the Bank of England. They raised the interest rate by 25 basis points, this was exactly what was also expected in the market. [Gundlach responded](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/jeffrey-gundlach-says-he-would-buy-bitcoin-over-gold-in-the-short-term.html?&amp;qsearchterm=BITCOIN) by saying that the Fed's announcement of a rate hike is just following the 2-year capital market rate. He added that they were already far behind.

&amp;#x200B;

The CEO then said, ""Equities are oversold and will rise in the short term, but will roll over once there are a few more rate hikes."" This could also be a positive development for cryptocurrency due to the rising correlation between bitcoin and stocks. Bitcoin is often compared to gold, with proponents saying it is a hedge against inflation and an alternative investment strategy during crisis periods.

&amp;#x200B;

Mike Novogratz, also a billionaire and cryptocurrency advocate, compared bitcoin to diamonds and gold. As a reason, he gives that bitcoin is not regulated by the government. In addition, he predicts that bitcoin could reach $500,000 within five years. Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, also had only positive things to say about bitcoin. He even described the world's largest cryptocurrency as ""pure gold,"" as Crypto Insiders previously reported.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin price action**

Bitcoin, the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency in the world, is worth about $40,700 at the time of writing. This is a slight drop since yesterday's peak of $41,717. With inflation rapidly rising, the Fed is feeling heavy pressure to keep consumer prices under control.

He has embarked on his mission to run across 40 countries in 400 days with only bitcoin in his pocket. Paco the Runner, also known as Paco de la India began his exciting adventure on September 17, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**A bitcoin standard**

Paco is paying for his trip thanks to all bitcoiners from around the world. The ambitious runner wants to show that ""bitcoin gives everyone freedom in the way they wish."" Paco became inspired about bitcoin while reading ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Saifedean Ammous.

&amp;#x200B;

Ammous' bestseller and many discussions with friends led him down the proverbial rabbit hole. In his own words, Paco went from ""a life based on the lie called the fiat standard"" to a bitcoin standard.

&amp;#x200B;

**His adventures**

Paco has now been on the road for 181 days and the athlete is almost at the halfway point of his adventure. He is currently on his way to Africa where he plans to visit Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, among others. So far, Paco has successfully lived under a bitcoin standard in all seven countries he has visited. He only uses cash for public transportation, with which it is still difficult to pay with bitcoin.

Along the way, he has also had to overcome some obstacles that initially have nothing to do with bitcoin. For example, during his trek through Sri Lanka, Paco lost the keys to his hotel room, which the hotel owner was not happy about. However, the optimistic runner asked for a spare key, ran to a nearby village and managed to make a new key at a key maker's shop, which he was allowed to pay for with bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

He has another great story about his run through Koh Samui in Thailand. An island known for its anti-bitcoin sentiment. At first, Paco was anxious about the 100 kilometers he had to travel there without money. However, it took 200 meters before he came across a sign that said they accepted bitcoin.

CryptoCurrency,It is beyond delusional to think traditional finance will die and go away. 100% decentralization is a dream and nothing else. All of you should get used to a future with CBDCs.,"CBDCs will soon be on everyone’s minds and in the digital wallets of the general population. According to [The Atlantic Council,](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/), “87 countries (representing over 90 percent of global GDP) are exploring a CBDC. In May 2020, only 35 countries were considering a CBDC. 9 countries have now fully launched a digital currency. Nigeria is the latest country to launch a CBDC, the e-Naira, the first outside the Caribbean. 14 countries, including China and South Korea, are now in the pilot stage with their CBDCs and preparing a possible full launch.”  
  
The possibilities for CBDCs are endless. A CBDC could be money that is GIVEN to you by the government to supplement your income; this can be programmed so that you can't gamble it away or spend it on booze and cigarettes or something. Another could be like the money in your bank account now and can be funded with your EARNED money and some GIVEN money, except that it is stored in a digital wallet instead of a bank. Money can be programmable so that a shipment is paid for on satisfactory arrival. CBDCs could be used for record keeping when purchasing a car, a house, or to help you gain credit when applying for a loan.  
  
According to Blockchain 101, “CBDCs and their applications aim to offer a reliable alternative to cash rather than serving as its replacement. The next important functionality of CBDCs evident in their use cases refers to the support for digitization.  
  
With the help of digitization, CBDCs can offer exceptional benefits like peer-to-peer transfers, transparent and competitive ecosystems, along programmable payments featuring smart contract support. Furthermore, central bank digital currency use cases for cross-border payments could also utilize interoperability with foreign CBDCs or multi-CBDC platforms.”  
  
Projects like [Quant Network (QNT)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/quant-network-overledger-network-quant-crypto-qnt-token#section-public-distributed-ledger-solutions-multi-chain-smart-contracts-and-m-dapps), CBDCs and regulated, fully-compliant exchanges like [LCX](https://www.lcx.com/about/) are the future for crypto and digital money. Quant could connect CBDCs and make them easily interoperable with any blockchain, which could open the crypto market to billions of more people and institutions. A CBDC created by countries all around the world running through Quant’s Overledger technology solve the problems that cryptocurrencies face with interoperability, volatility, and legal certainty that hamper a practical day-to-day worldwide application. Distributed ledger technology, which uses tokens to represent real goods and services and allows these to be traded digitally, makes it possible for flows of services to be programmable, autonomous and automated.  
  
Imagine if the government were able to give people assistance and program exactly what the money is intended for. Maybe with a digital record taxes could be filed automatically. There are so many possibilities, I can’t see CBDCs not being a huge success. I can already predict that the majority of CBDC users won’t care about using crypto, as long as they are able to make instant, fee-less or low-cost cross-border transactions. According to the International Monetary Fund: “CBDCs are more cost efficient than physical cash as they have lower transaction costs; they can promote financial inclusion, meaning those who are unbanked can get easier and safer access to money on their phone; they can compete with private companies that need incentives to meet transparency standards and limit illicit activity; and they can help monetary policy flow more quickly and seamlessly.”  
  
Furthermore, there is no volatility, so users don’t have to worry about wild fluctuations in value and don’t have to put their money into a stable coin like Tether. Would you trust keeping your spending money in Tether, run by [this random guy with very little presence on the internet](https://theorg.com/org/bitfinex/org-chart/jl-van-der-velde), or in the full faith and credit of the American government?  
  
According to Bloomberg, “They could also improve access to legal tender in countries where cash supplies are dwindling. An IMF paper said the new currencies could boost financial inclusion in places where private financial institutions find it unprofitable to operate, and generate more resilience in regions prone to natural disasters.”  
  
Even if your plan is to stick all of your money into Bitcoin and avoid any connection to government and banks, please take the time to read about and understand CBDCs and how the could end up helping a lot of average everyday people around the world. It is impossible to deny: CBDCs won’t be going away and they will soon become a part of everyone’s lives.

We’ve been repaying the loans which we have already refinanced twice, once from federal loans to private loans where we consolidated, and then again to take advantage of low interest rates. 

In 2019 Trump enacted a rule that allowed up to $10,000 to be used towards paying student loans. So this leads me to the following questions:

1- can we contribute the max $10k (not necessarily in lump sum) and then immediately pay down her loans without any “seasoning” inside the 529 plan?

2- since a portion of the lons were derived from a Connecticut school, if I use the funds to pay the student loans that have been refinanced (commingled with loans from an NY school), are the funds still eligible from state tax deductions?",finance,1647563827.0

stocks,"Stock Traders Brace for a $3.5 Trillion ‘Triple Witching’ Event tomorrow March 18, 2022","In a quarterly event known as triple witching, roughly $3.5 trillion of single-stock and index-level options are set to expire, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. At the same time, more near-the-money options are maturing than at any time since 2019 -- suggesting a bevy of investors will actively trade around those positions.

And once [again](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/triple-witching-to-hit-market-where-traders-pay-up-for-hedges), this triple witching coincides with a rebalancing of benchmark indexes including the S&amp;P 500 -- a combination that tends to spark single-day volumes that rank among the highest of the year. According to an estimate from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the rebalance in the index alone could spur $33 billion of stock trades.

Friday’s session lands just as the S&amp;P 500 regains its [footing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/stocks-aided-by-upbeat-powell-bonds-flash-caution-markets-wrap) with a three-day jump, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s optimism the economy can withstand rate hikes and China’s promise to bolster its financial markets. Yet in the telling of derivatives pros, the rally has been fueled by dealers covering short positions to balance exposures while demand for stock hedges is elevated.

Now as many contracts expire, the key question is whether investors will rebuild their holdings of protective puts amid growth concerns and the war in Ukraine -- or will they chase the market rebound with call contracts.

CryptoCurrency,I asked some lawyers if the gov can take your crypto in a civil forfeiture (USA),"So real fast, I'm not a legal person and this isn't legal advice. I'm just sharing what I found out.

# What is civil forfeiture

In the USA basically the cops can take things if the suspect it could of been used in a crime (any crime even if there is no crime going on now or in the area and any evidence). Lets put it this way, in CA there is pot shops that used armor trucks to move their money (which many stores use).  Pot shops in CA is legal, but the cops on a regular bases stopped the truck for stupid things like using the turn signal too early. They use civil forfeiture to take the cash.

From there in all cases they send the stuff to the gov, and the gov gives the local cops a major amount of the value of the assets. 

Note in some states this is illegal like NC. But I seen in the past years where federal wants to cause a loophole using DEA to force cops by law to do it. 

But note if you travel through states with this being legal.

&amp;#x200B;

Note this is actually is a huge problem in the USA. Even more for unbanked people and homeless. ALL lawyers and all people I talked to in legal/law thinks this is the ultimate forum of government theft, and this should be federally illegal. That the system is proven to be extremely abused just for the reason of bonuses and the ones taking the money keep a ton of it after it went through the system.

# My question

1. Can the gov force you to unlock your phone in a civil forfeiture? This giving them access to your hot wallets.
2. Can the gov take your crypto in a civil forfeiture since it is on the blockchain?

It should be noted that with 2, there is no clear answer to this. Basically it came down to it has to be tested in courts or a law maker needs to make laws clearing this up.

**NOTE FOR ANY LAW MAKERS THAT WANT TO HELP WHO THEY REPRESENT, AND WANT TO MAKE A BILL TO HELP THEM GET REELECTED. FIX THIS**

&amp;#x200B;

# What I found out

* So can they take your phone or hardware wallet? 

The answer to this seems to be yes.

* Can they force you to unlock your phone? 

The answer to this seems to be not without a warrant.

* Can they brute force, hack, or do whatever to get in after they taken the device in a civil forfeiture? 

The answer seems to be yes. Basically, the idea is that when this happens it now becomes gov property. And if the gov wants to break in their own property or wipe their end. There isn't jack you can do to stop them expect remote format the device (seriously look into this. You can do this with most phones.)

* Are they likely to break into your phone/hardware wallet if they take it?

While there isn't really evidence of this happening yet. The likely if it was to happen then yes. The question is, do they know of a 0 day which will allow them to get in, and that answer to this is maybe. Like I've seen videos of people recovering their funds from their hardware wallet through taking apart something like a ledger, hooking up to given things, and doing a few other things. So lets not rule out they will have some way of doing just this. Because it is likely if they take one, then they most likely are taking as many as they see.

* Can the gov use civil forfeiture to get the crypto itself without going after the phone/hardware wallet?

Chances are is no. Like they can't demand for the given crypto since they have no way of knowing the wallet address unless if you show them or after they taken the device. They have to prove in court they suspected x was used in some way with a crime. Not knowing the address prior to rules this out. So basically, don't talk to the legal people without a lawyer and don't give them more info than needed.

Note: if they use the law to take the phone or hardware wallet, then they can make a case that maybe the crypto is part of the taking since you have direct control of the crypto using your phone. Therefore the crypto could've also been used in crime in some way in the same way the phone could've been. Basically, it is the argument of can they take the truck and the music CD inside thing.

* How to handle the situation?

Don't talk to the cops about anything you don't have to. Note the laws, but in general if they ask you to get out of the car ask if it is a command. If they say yes, then get out. If they asked for documents, then give it (don't be an idiot, just give it to them even the technical bits you don't need to. You will just PO the cop which can cause problems.) Ask them if you can leave, and that you would like to leave. This indicates you aren't volunteering your stay, and in many states they have to be reasonable about the length of the stop and many cases they won't have enough time to do something stupid. When asked questions you don't have to answer say a lawyer friend told you to not talk to the cops while being questioned or at a stop. Never agree to them searching your car or you without a warrant. Never argue with them on the side of the road, the day for that is in court (meaning if they decided to arrest you, then let them and then wait to fight it in court since it is likely you can get a big paycheck if done right). Never be open about what you have. 

If they take the item using civil forfeiture, then it is likely any cash will be gone forever since some of these court cases can last for years. But you can and should fight them in court because there is a growing amount of cases which is forcing judges and others to look more into this and treat it more serious. If you can't afford a lawyer to fight, then there is a few groups that you can call depending on if you have military background, extreme poverty, and so on.

&gt;**But to be blunt, the best way to fight this risk is by getting law makers to make civil forfeiture illegal.**

But first, is it possible to sue a mortgage lender for negligence? Please let me know your thoughts if you read through this. Ty

Details - I rate locked at 2.25% on a 30 year VA loan, was pre-approved for a 0 down loan up to $400k with a 90 rate lock.

I've been working with a Penfed loan officer for 2 months now and times been getting tight to get under contract in order to keep this great rate. So finally we get a winner after the third try and go under contract. Super excited!

My offer was accepted over the weekend while my lender was closed, so Monday morning I excitedly call the loan officer, but they never got back to me. In the meantime, the relator and I are moving forward with the closing company and home inspector..

Tuesday rolls around. That morning I pay out ~$4,000 for the earnest money and home inspector. ~2 hours later I get an email from Penfed that a new loan officer was assigned to me. So I gave the new loan officer a call.

They need $35,000 down plus ~10k closing. I only have about $28k saved up. The old loan officer messed up. I was told I could get a FHA, or conventional loan at current rates =(. I can't get the house. Also, I just wired the earnest money, which I'm pretty sure won't be recovered. 

Needless to say I'm pretty upset after that conversation, $4k out, with the need to get a cheaper than expected house asap before the rate lock expires in a month. So Wednesday I email the new loan officer asking the actual 0 down amount I could use. I was informed they cancelled my loan application and would no longer work with me. Rates are significantly higher, I have now moved, no house, out a couple months rent, with no housing prospects or any desire to work with penfed again.

I'm left not knowing if they really just BS'd me because they didn't want to offer the loan. Also, how could they cancel my loan application with a month left rate locked?  Just a sorry, bye.",finance,1647584422.0

cardano,Cardano grows in important stats,"It can be difficult for people to make a good estimate of a project’s potential. There are a lot of false narratives floating around in the cryptocurrency space. In this article, we’ll look at the stats that really matter and we provide relevant context. You will see that Cardano does very well in stats, but hard data is not the most important thing for adoption.

 

### TLDR

* Cardano is a mission-oriented project and success will be measured based on positive contribution to society.
* Blockchain projects have different missions and their adoption will follow a different trajectory.
* Market capitalization is always the result of many causes. The causes of success will vary from project to project.
* In less than 1 year, the number of addresses holding ADA coins has more than tripled. In terms of transactions per 24 hours, Bitcoin is only slightly better than Cardano. The difference is not even double.
* Cardano is a relatively young project that is only now coming to the fore. Nevertheless, there is interest in it on social media. Over the past two years, interest in Cardano has increased 10x. In the case of Bitcoin 3X.
* Cardano has led the stats related to activity on GitHub for years.
* The development of blockchain technology is important because we still don’t know what is the best solution for the future. No technology in the world has long-term dominance. Leadership can only be maintained through innovation.
* The degree of decentralization, scalability, security, programmability, tokenization capabilities, governance, network usage fees, second layer quality, are all characteristics that can be objectively compared to each other.
* Total Value Locked in the Cardano ecosystem makes a new ATH every month.
* In the sixth round of Catalyst, $4M in ADA was available for 711 applications. Almost 45,000 wallets have voted and 151 projects have received funding. 
* The growing value may attract new users, but if adoption is built on speculation, it may not last long. Long-term adoption must be built on utility.
* To assess the potential of a project, it is critical to understand the stage of development it is in. There is data that no statistics will capture. It’s important to look at a project holistically and connect all the important factors.
* Adoption is not just about hard data and comparisons. Personal preferences are also important.

### Market capitalization is a consequence, not a cause of success

One of the false narratives in the cryptocurrency world is that the measure of success is the market capitalization of a project. People are able to dismiss a project based on the decreasing market value of the coins. Cardano is a mission-oriented project and its purpose is definitely not about short-term speculation. Success will be measured based on the rate of adoption and positive contribution to society. This is a long-term mission and takes time.

The technological development of the project is still at an early stage. Cardano has a working Proof-of-Stake and it is possible to create decentralized services through smart contracts. However, this is just the beginning. The development of the protocol and infrastructure is not over and will continue. Creating decentralized services and their adoption takes time. Dealing with companies and governments also takes time. Deploying a solution at the state level is a job for years, not months.

It is important to understand what stage the project is at. Proof-of-Stake on Cardano was launched in 2020. Smart contracts came in 2021. The first DeFi services started appearing in early 2022. Protocol adoption has only just started and there is no point in comparing this to other projects that have been around longer. Bitcoin was launched in 2009. Clearly, its adoption will be significantly greater.

It makes no sense to argue that Cardano has no chance because it can’t outperform Bitcoin or Ethereum. The missions of Cardano, Bitcoin, and Ethereum are fundamentally different. The projects are also fundamentally different from each other technologically. Therefore, the adoption of the projects will also be completely different. There will be users who will just hold BTC and never use DeFi services. On the other hand, there will be users who will use Cardano on a daily basis. Many people will use both Bitcoin and Cardano, which is a reasonable middle ground. The rivalry and tribalism between projects are silly and only take place on social media. It will have minimal effect on mass adoption.

People should distinguish more between cause and effect. Why is Bitcoin now the number one by the market capitalization? Obviously, because it is the oldest project, despite the fact that it is still very young. For years Bitcoin had no competition, as the first attempts were basically just copies. The first good attempt was Ethereum. Cardano is another one of many. Technologically different competition is basically only now emerging. Bitcoin’s high market capitalization is a consequence, not a cause. The causes are age, high network effect, technology, popularity among institutional investors, community defending the status quo, etc.

Are there causes that may affect the market capitalization of Cardano? Apparently yes. In part they will be similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum, in part they will be unique. Cardano has a strong community, a rapidly growing network effect, a sound technology that will continue to evolve. What makes Cardano unique? Cardano uses PoS consensus, so users can stake their ADA coins. Therefore, it can provide passive income to ADA coin holders. Cardano is a platform, so the network effect will grow not only based on the ability to store value but also based on functionality. This functionality is interesting for developing countries that can build their social and financial infrastructure on top of it. This process is in progress, especially in Africa. There is real interest in Cardano. Fortune 500 companies are also showing interest.

Cryptocurrencies are bringing disruption to the financial world in particular. The financial world is not just about money and transmission networks. The financial world is about banking services, about contracts between users, about creating trust between two parties who do not trust each other. The financial world is closely interconnected with other sectors. The idea that we will create a new digital non-state money and use it centrally like current fiat money would be considered a failure of the whole industry. It is more likely that the concept of decentralization will penetrate other sectors, as current fiat money is. If you want to buy, say, a stock, you have to trust the third party you send your order to. Then they will fill your order. If it is possible to do the same thing in a decentralized way and at the same time it is faster, cheaper, more reliable, more resistant to censorship, and more secure in terms of misuse of funds or personal data, that is probably our future.

Market capitalization is the result of several phenomena, but they all essentially depend on adoption and the size of the network effect. The higher the network effect, the more beneficial the network will be to society. The success of IT giants such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter is built on exactly the same principle. There are multiple big IT giants because they differ in capabilities and functionality. Google doesn’t have a community to urge others not to use, say, Facebook. The competition takes place on a technological basis. Google, for example, has tried to create a social network.

People use what they need. It’s silly to advise someone to hold Bitcoin and not use DeFi on Cardano. People won’t take silly advice and will naturally use the services available. If these services offer people some benefits, they will be popular and their network effect will grow. Maximalism on a technological level has never worked and will not work in the world of blockchain technology.

Cardano’s market capitalization will grow over time as a result of its success in growing the network effect. This process takes time. You can tell if Cardano is on track not by the current market value of ADA coins, but by the statistics that tell the story of adoption and interest.

### Growth in the number of users and transactions

Cryptocurrencies are perceived as an alternative to fiat money, mainly due to the immutable monetary policy. Cryptocurrencies are generally a better store of value in the long term than a medium of exchange in the short term due to their high volatility. However, despite the volatility, cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services. Cryptocurrencies are non-state money and no one can mandate their use in a particular territory. Adoption is dependent on the free decision of individuals. Success will be higher the more people consider the coins of a given project as a store of value or money. In this regard, it is important to keep track of statistics regarding the number of wallets carrying ADA coins.

Finding out this figure can be complicated by the fact that people may hold cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges or use other custodial solutions. The exact numbers of holders are therefore relatively difficult to estimate. What we can determine relatively accurately is the number of blockchain addresses holding the coins. It is also easy to find out the number of active addresses, i.e. addresses that have used the coins in the last 24 hours. This figure correlates with the number of transactions.

At the time of this writing, there are approximately 3.5 million addresses with ADA coins. Approximately 1.1 million users delegate ADA coins to pools. Roughly 100,000 to 160,000 people per day send a Cardano transaction.

If we were to compare these figures with Bitcoin over the same period, we would find that there are approximately 40 million addresses with BTC coins. The number of active addresses, and therefore transactions, is approximately 100,000 to 300,000 per day.

Bitcoin has more than a 10-year lead over Cardano in adoption if we count Cardano adoption since 2020 when Cardano switched to Proof-of-Stake consensus. In the number of on-chain coin addresses, Bitcoin is only approximately 11x larger. In terms of transactions, the difference is not even double. Other factors can affect the statistics, such as the Lightning Network reducing the number of transactions on Bitcoin. The Lightning Network (LN) has roughly 90,000 open channels. LN nodes with active channels are about 20,000. Let’s add that Cardano can move multiple UTXOs in one transaction thanks to Plutus scripts.

To add context, as recently as May 2021, Cardano had only 1 million addresses with ADA coins. By December 2021, it was already at approximately 2.5 million. At the time of writing, it’s already 3.5 million. The number of users has more than tripled in less than a year.

In terms of the number of transactions per day, Bitcoin is only slightly better than Cardano. With Cardano’s DeFi boom yet to come, it is realistic that Cardano will soon surpass Bitcoin in this statistic. Cardano is a platform, so its strength lies in the growth of the network effect in the sense of directly connecting users. This is what makes Cardano different from Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin’s mission is primarily about holding BTC coins in your wallet and making payments if necessary. Bitcoin’s mission is not about financial services competing with banks. Cardano is being built to enable the building of social and financial infrastructure. In addition to payments, it wants to enable financial services like loans, insurance, savings, stock trading, etc. For this kind of use case, adoption at a local level, for example at the state level, is important. Therefore, the IOG team, in collaboration with governments, is trying to use Cardano in developing countries. Cardano can be used in developed countries to tokenize current financial assets if regulation allows. In our view, it is a question of time. 

Creating a direct network effect and seeking the adoption of decentralized services at the level of governments, companies, and institutions is extremely important for the success of Cardano. In other words, while institutions can hold BTC as a hedge against inflation, they can use Cardano services on a daily basis. At the same time, they can also hold ADA coins and stake them for ensuring passive income and for decision-making rights in the Cardano network.

 

### It’s not just about hard data and comparisons

To assess the potential of a project, it is critical to understand the stage of development it is in. Common quick comparisons of Cardano with older projects can be misleading. Sizing by market capitalization is downright nonsense. It is necessary to keep an eye on statistics that are meaningful over the long term. However, this may not be enough. 

There is data that no statistics will capture. For example, being number one in GitHub activity tells the average person nothing about the quality of the design and security of the protocol. The IOG team has over 400 employees. While you can look at their profiles, it doesn’t tell you anything about their workload and performance. The importance of collaboration with governments and Fortune 500 companies is also hard to measure. Many independent teams and individuals acknowledge Cardano’s qualitative edge. Recently, for example, the Kraken Exchange team. Cardano has a very strong and engaged community. If you want to be intellectually honest in your assessment of the project and get the full picture, you can’t ignore soft data.

Additionally, be aware some hard data can be misleading. A large number of projects can be created on smart contract platforms, but it is important that someone uses them. The number of apps created may not be the most accurate information, as a large number of them may be dead projects that have already been replaced by competitors. What is interesting is the total number of users of a given platform and the amount of Total Value Locked (TVL). However, it could be that the number of users is being faked and that there are several whales behind the high TVL. It is necessary to be very careful and research things in depth.

It’s important to look at a project holistically and connect all the important factors. This is difficult because it requires good insight into many disciplines including information technology, finance, law, regulation, politics, and sociology. 

All of these points of view are important. Blockchain is a disruptive technology and will affect almost all areas of human activity. What we don’t know now is when and how exactly it will happen. People tend to compare hard data and that’s perfectly fine. However, in terms of future potential, this is not a complete picture of reality. The maturity of the technology and new features will influence adoption, because the more it enables, the more impact it will have. Regulation will have a major impact, as we will not see the tokenization of shares without permission from authorities. Politicians make adoption decisions at the state level. Financial institutions and firms must be willing to move to new technologies, and this may take years. There are still many unknowns in the world of cryptocurrencies and a few decisions or events can literally turn everything upside down. In a positive or negative sense.

It is difficult to estimate the potential of one particular blockchain project. It is significantly more difficult to get a complete picture of the entire blockchain industry. You should have a deep insight across multiple blockchain projects, which is an unattainable goal for an individual. 

There is a lot of hard and soft data available to compare projects with each other. But alongside this, there are your personal reasons and considerations for adopting a given project. It could be the philosophy and mission of the project, the popularity of the team, the community, transparency, a particular activity or service.

An individual will always advocate for the project in which he or she has the most investment. The economic interest is often the strongest. It is good to be aware that many people will not tell you the truth in the cryptocurrency world. For purely selfish reasons, people may knowingly lie to you. It is extremely important to do your own research, check everything out from multiple sources and make up your own mind. It’s easy to resign yourself to this activity and tell yourself that Bitcoin and Ethereum are the current market leaders. Still, we think you shouldn’t overlook Cardano. 

From our perspective, the world of cryptocurrencies is not purely about speculation, but about the potential to change our society. It is good to see cryptocurrencies through this lens as well and to be with a project that can bring about this change. At the heart of Cardano is decentralization, as this is a feature that makes the whole industry unique. ADA in your hands is the key to a high level of decentralization.

Some maximalists try to convince us that the only important metric is market capitalization. This is certainly not Satoshi’s original vision. Satoshi’s vision is about decentralization and the ability to replace unreliable middlemen. It is a vision of freedom and privacy. Satoshi would very likely never be a maximalist at the technological level. You don’t have to be a maximalist either.

### What is next for Cardano

The mother of all statistics in the Internet world is the network effect. Cryptocurrencies with tens of millions of holders cannot compete with social networks used by billions of people. DeFi services are younger and therefore even further behind in adoption when compared with the first generation of cryptocurrencies. The adoption trend so far is very positive and the numbers can be expected to grow. 

Technological progress will drive adoption. The individual features and parameters of the protocols will improve as well as their functionality. Cryptocurrencies will only succeed if they start to be a viable alternative to current banking services. Once it becomes normal for 10% of the population to take out a loan through DeFi services, we will see a meteoric rise. So far we are not even close to 1%. Cryptocurrencies have the best ahead of them and Cardano is doing very well in all the important stats.

Cardano’s main strength lies in its ability to build financial and social infrastructure. The technological capabilities of the Cardano platform and the ability to build secure and reliable DeFi services is what will determine success. Cardano is not here to compete with Bitcoin and its mission is fundamentally different. Ethereum is also a platform, so these projects will bump into each other more often. However, this is only a good thing from the users’ point of view, as the competitive environment speeds up development.

If you want to know the answer to whether Cardano has a future, you should ask whether DeFi makes sense. We believe it definitely makes sense. There is no logical reason why DeFi should fail. It’s just a natural extension of existing decentralization capabilities. The first generation of blockchain could only transfer value. This is useful for making payments to someone you trust or physically see in a restaurant, for example. The next generation can transfer value conditionally. This will allow mutually secure stock purchases between people who don’t trust each other. Both make sense.

DeFi industry is more technologically complex and more connected to the physical world. In many cases, it will require the involvement of real identities and connections to existing financial services, which is something that is coming anyway in the context of current regulations. It’s good to remember that Bitcoin functionality is essentially finished and development will happen on higher layers. Cardano is not finished and will continue to evolve. Think about this when you or anyone else tries to compare Bitcoin and Cardano. You may find that the comparison often makes no sense. It makes more sense to compare Cardano and Ethereum.

We can see the differences in the mission of Cardano and Ethereum. Cardano is trying to build a secure ecosystem at the cost of higher demands on developers. Haskell/Plutus, as the primary programming language for writing scripts, can be something of a hurdle for the average developer to overcome. Cardano is built as a mission-critical system and formal methods are used in the development. This approach can slow down development, although we have seen from the Proof-of-Stake example that this need not be the case.

Ethereum has a dominant position in the DeFi sector, but the competition is quickly catching up. Ethereum has lost 11% of its dominance in half a year. In June 2021, Ethereum had a dominance of 73%. In December 2021, it was only 62%. Notice that there is no significant competitor yet. Rather there are more similar projects. Cardano will likely gain a part of the market share in 2022. Anyway, it is not true that Cardano has missed the train, as some often claim. Cardano is going at its own pace for its future users.

 To be clear, voluntary adoption of decentralized services across the world is not the only adoption direction. the IOG team seeks direct adoption through collaboration with governments in developing countries. This type of adoption is extremely demanding in terms of administration and the effect may take several years to be felt. However, if successful, adoption could increase by tens of millions of people.

Let’s not forget that people may consider the ADA to be a store of value in the same way that BTC is. They may not desire to use decentralized services. Cardano has a similar monetary policy to Bitcoin and the number of ADA coins is limited to 45 billion. Staking may be the only motivation for people to hold ADA. As we said, people may have different reasons for holding ADA coins. The importance of soft data can be greater than hard data.

### Conclusion

The market capitalization of projects will reflect their financial and social significance in society. Speculation is part of social meaning, but it may be a bubble that bursts. Direct network effects and a strong user base take a long time to build, but after that, market capitalization can stabilize. The reverse doesn’t work so well. The growing value may attract new users, but if adoption is built on speculation, it may not last long. Long-term adoption and natural growth must be based on utility. 

Holding cryptocurrencies in wallets for the store of value feature is certainly a given form of use. If people are forced to continue using fiat currencies because of their ability to maintain purchasing power, the importance of cryptocurrencies will continue to be marginal. Cryptocurrencies must offer the world not only a store of value but also a reliable means of exchange. Financial services need stability, reliability, and security. Thanks to Cardano, people will get that in the coming years.

stocks,St. Louis Fed’s Bullard says the central bank should raise rates above 3% this year,"St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he thinks the central bank should raise interest rates the equivalent of 12 times this year to convince the public it is serious about fighting inflation. As the lone dissenter at this week’s Federal Reserve meeting, Bullard said in a statement that he would like to see the central bank’s benchmark interest rate boosted above 3% from the near-0% level where it had stood. “This would quickly adjust the policy rate to a more appropriate level for the current circumstances,” he said. Following its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday said it would raise overnight rates for banks by 0.25 percentage point, historically the typical increment with which the FOMC moves. Accompanying economic projections indicated a path this year that would see the equivalent of seven rate hikes, or 1.75 percentage points. The move was the first time the Fed has raised the rate since December 2018 and came in response to a stunning increase in inflation that has seen prices rise at their fastest pace in 40 years.

Bullard was the only FOMC member to vote against the move, stating he would have preferred a rate hike of 0.5 percentage point, or 50 basis points. He added the Fed also should have started the process of reducing the nearly $9 trillion in bond holdings it has accumulated over the past 14 years. In his statement Friday, Bullard said inflation is hurting people the Fed is trying to help the most, namely those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. “The burden of excessive inflation is particularly heavy for people with modest incomes and wealth and for those with limited ability to adjust to a rising cost of living,” he said. “The combination of strong real economic performance and unexpectedly high inflation means that the Committee’s policy rate is currently far too low to prudently manage the U.S. macroeconomic situation.”

Fed officials overall were divided on how to proceed with rates this year. Ten members penciled in a fed funds rate of 1.75%-2% by year’s end, but eight said it should be higher. The highest “dot” on the committee’s dot plot, presumably Bullard’s, indicated a range of 3%-3.25%. He pointed out that the Fed has moved that aggressively before, in 1994-95 to combat a revving economy and a gradual rise in inflation. “The results were excellent,” Bullard said. “The Committee achieved 2% inflation on average and the U.S. economy boomed during the second half of the 1990s. I think the Committee should try to achieve a similar outcome in the current environment.” On the issue of the Fed’s balance sheet, Bullard did not provide details of what he thinks the central bank should do, saying only that “a plan” at this week’s meeting would have been appropriate. The post-meeting statement indicated that the committee “expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said afterward that the process could begin as soon as May.

It benefits from access to cheap funding as China has been easing its monetary policy. They can afford to do that as the latest inflation figure was 0.9% in China.

In 2021 revenues were up almost 52%. At about $581mln, slightly more than the current Market Cap (P/S ratio &gt; 1, rare thing).

Nevertheless, the price went down during the latest few months because of all-out war concerns but also because Q4 &amp; Q1 are traditionally soft quarters, due to weather. Gross margin slightly lower reflecting higher commodity and shipping costs. Which are expected to fall onward. 

This year the sales are estimated to go up roughly 40%.

52 week high of $44/share, low of $7.50.

personalfinance,"New job, 401k delay, how to accrue 401k contributions in bank account properly?","So my new job has a 90 day delay on traditional 401k set-up for whatever reason. I normally contribute 20% of my paycheck to 401k. 

Thus, for 3 months I will be contributing 0% (since the account doesn't exist yet) and the 3 following months I will be contributing 40% in catch-up


For budgeting purposes I'd like to move the ""should be 401k"" to a separate savings account each paycheck for the first 90 days, then during the catch-up period I would release that amount each paycheck.


However, given tax brackets, gross vs net, social security, etc what should be my estimate calculation be on how much Net pay belongs to 401k contributions? 


For the sake of simplicity we can assume the entire 401k gross income hits the 24% federal tax bracket and a 5% flat state tax.

**Cyber Command chief tells Congress chip shortage has national security implications**

China’s increasing progress toward producing enough semiconductor chips domestically to avoid relying on foreign trade is an issue of great concern for us in terms of broader impacts, U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency head Gen. Paul Nakasone told House Intelligence Committee members this week. He added, China’s progress toward chip independence would give the Chinese more leverage to act as they please without fear of sanctions. He added the United States is lagging in domestic semiconductor chip production, and noted that Ukraine and Russia produce 90% of America’s neon gas, which is critical for the lasers used to make chips.([Cyberscoop](https://www.cyberscoop.com/cyber-command-chief-congress-chip-shortage-national-security/))

**Zero-click flaws in widely used UPS devices threaten critical infrastructure**Three critical security vulnerabilities in widely used smart uninterruptible power supply (UPS) devices could allow for remote takeover, meaning that malicious actors could cause business disruptions, data loss and even physical harm to critical infrastructure, researchers at Armis have found. The flaws, which Armis has dubbed TLStorm, are in APC Smart-UPS devices, which number about 20 million in deployment worldwide. APC is a subsidiary of Schneider Electric. Being controlled through a cloud connection means a bad actor could remotely take over devices without the user ever knowing about it,” The researchers warned. Furthermore, an attacker could gain code execution on a device, forcing it to physically damage itself or other assets connected to it, they said.([ThreatPost](https://threatpost.com/zero-click-flaws-ups-critical-infratructure/178810/))

**Mobile endpoints see a lot of malicious apps**A new report by the security firm Zimperium found that in 2021 25% of mobile endpoints have encountered a malicious app. The report also found a 466% increase in exploited zero-day vulnerabilities on mobile endpoints in the year, with iOS devices accounting for 60% of victims. With phishing on the rise, it’s unsurprising that 75% of phishing websites seen in the study were specifically targeting mobile devices.. Overall 42% of enterprises reported either mobile devices or web apps led to security incidents in 2021.([VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/14/report-25-of-mobile-endpoints-have-faced-malicious-apps/))

**FTC to fine CafePress for cover up of massive data breach**The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced plans to slap CafePress custom t-shirt and merchandise site, with a $500,000 fine for a breach that affected over 23 million of its users. Instead of responsibly informing customers about the breach, CafePress instead closed the users’ accounts and charged them each a $25 account closure fee. The FTC explained that CafePress stored customer Social Security numbers and password reset answers in plain text, and retained user data for longer than necessary. As part of the proposed settlement, CafePress will be required to implement multi-factor authentication, minimize data collection and retention, and encrypt Social Security numbers stored on its servers.([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ftc-to-fine-cafepress-for-cover-up-of-massive-data-breach/))

**Report uncovers alarming level of alert fatigue in Cloud environments**Orca Security commissioned a global, cross-industry study among IT decision makers to examine the current state of cloud security alert fatigue. The report revealed that security teams are inundated with cloud security alerts with 59% of respondents receiving more than 500 cloud security alerts per day. The survey showed that monitoring alerts is causing burnout with roughly 60% respondents indicating that alert fatigue has contributed to staff turnover and also has created internal friction. The report also shows a false sense of confidence with more than 95% responding that they feel confident or very confident in their tooling, despite 43% of respondents indicating that more than 40% of their alerts are false positives, roughly half saying more than 40% of alerts are low priority, and more than half of respondents indicated that critical alerts are being missed.([Orca Security](https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Orca-2022-Cloud-Security-Alert-Fatigue-Report.pdf))

**Phony Instagram ‘support staff’ emails hit insurance company**A phishing campaign disguised as originating from Instagram technical support was used to steal login credentials from employees of a prominent U.S. life insurance company headquartered in New York. According to a report published by Armorblox on Wednesday, the attack bypassed Google’s email security by using a valid domain name. Although the email had grammar, spelling and capitalization errors, including spelling “Instagram Support” with a capital “L,” and the email itself coming from [membershipform@outlook.com.tr](mailto:membershipform@outlook.com.tr), which is based in Turkey. The researchers said that despite these misspellings, it clearly demonstrates that people are not seeing anything more than the word ‘membershipform’ before clicking on the link.([ThreatPost](https://threatpost.com/phony-instagram-support-staff-emails-hit-insurance-company/178929/))

**FBI Issues a lookout for SIM swapping attacks**The agency recently disclosed an increase in SIM swapping accounts to compromise victims’ virtual currency accounts and steal money from US citizens. From January 2018 to December 2020, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received 320 complaints related to SIM swapping incidents with adjusted losses of approximately $12 million. In 2021, IC3 received 1,611 SIM swapping complaints with adjusted losses of more than $68 million.([CISOMag](https://cisomag.eccouncil.org/fbi-issues-a-lookout-for-sim-swapping-attacks/))

**Russia faces IT crisis with just two months of data storage left**Russia faces a critical IT storage crisis after Western cloud providers pulled out of the country, leaving Russia with only two more months before they run out of data storage. The Russian government is exploring various solutions to resolve this IT storage problem, ranging from leasing all available domestic data storage to seizing IT resources left behind by businesses that pulled out of the country. Last week, the Ministry of Digital Development amended the 2016 Yarovaya Law to suspend a yearly requirement for telecom operators to increase storage capacity allocations by 15% for anti-terrorist surveillance purposes. Another move that could free up space would be to demand ISPs abandon media streaming services and other online entertainment platforms that eat up precious resources.([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/russia-faces-it-crisis-with-just-two-months-of-data-storage-left/))",technology,1647612040.0

personalfinance,TSP contributions maxed - next steps?,"Per the flow chart for this sub, I have slowly been upping my retirement contributions to get to 15%. I work for the federal government so I have TSP.  Simultaneously, I have been working on my career and I recently received a promotion and am now making ~$150k. I'm currently at 12% of income contributed and realized that at 13% (at my current salary, will change with step and inflation based increases) I will pretty much hit the $20,500 limit set on traditional retirement contributions. Past that amount, I will start to lose my employer match (5%). 

I'm wondering, what should I do? Should I take the remaining 2% and put it into a Roth? I think I still qualify bc even though my income is $150k, my MAGI was more like $110k or so on my 2021 taxes (though tbf I did not receive my promotion until late 2021. Previously my income was ~$130k, so I'm not sure how my MAGI would look after a year of my new salary). 

Anyway, should my plan be to calculate the remaining 2% and put that towards a Roth each pay period? And just recalculate and redistribute with each pay increase? Or is there a savvier way to handle this? I mentioned this to my CPA and she said that Traditional is ideal bc it keeps the income low for tax purposes (but she's a CPA so that's her focus).  But I'm a little concerned about the tax hit during retirement if I focus too much on traditional funds, since we also have the govt pension and SS and I'm not entirely sure I understand how that will all play out and how much I'll be receiving.

CryptoMarkets,Why Polygon is the best chain for stablecoin adoption using AAVE as a prime example of Polygon's liquidity and APY.,"In this post we're going to talk about AAVE an open source liquidity protocol in the context of stablecoin adoption. I feel like it's super necessary to have a ""home base"" of sort of. I think that's where stablecoins come in for a lot of us. The crypto market is like the PVP zone in an MMO and stablecoins are the main town. Stablecoins are usually pegged to fiat like USD or other cryptocurrencies like how DAI is pegged to Eth but anyway I'm sure you all knew this already.

AAVE is basically a non-custodial liquidity protocol where you can earn interest rates on your deposits and where you can borrow assets as well. This launched on Ethereum long ago and has launched on Polygon as well as avax less than a year ago. Personally as far as these kinds of protocols are concerned, I feel like measures like accessibility are more important than market cap.

 In a system where how much money you're actually making comes down to the dynamics of borrowing and  lending, all the aspects of interest should be looked at in order to  have a better understanding, It's not just one variable we're working with here. Deposit index is one of the many factors  we can start with. Although the deposit index for stablecoins is almost always the same, APYs on Polygon are 6.89% on Polygon compared to 3.92% on Avalanche. So by depositing your stablecoins on Polygon using the same protocol, you would have outperformed everyone else.

I urge you to DYOR as there are frankly many other factors to look into, I've simply only given you a taste but I will link what I used as reference. In hopes that you may be able to learn and piece it together for yourself.

CryptoCurrency,Am I being scammed?,"Hey, I'm really hoping some experts in here are able to explain/tell me if I'm being scammed. 

I'm a guy and I've been speaking with a girl from another country for about 3 months now. I would say its more than a friendship. 

Anyway, very early on in our conversations she brought up crypto mining and said that I should do it, and she would show me how.
I did some research and thought there's no way I can crypto mine, 1: I'm not clever enough and 2: I haven't even got a computer,  let alone super computer power. 

She then got me to download a digital wallet app and another app where I will transfer my crypto too. We are 'mining' USTD, which is a stable coin. 
However,  I'm sure it's not crypto mining, she's basically give me a hyperlink to use on the DApps (Decentralized apps) which takes me through to a mining pool where I can claim anywhere from 1-6% interest daily (depending on my wallet balance) 

So I started off putting 100 USDT to see if it would work,  and it sure did. I was receiving 1.5% everyday, but that's hardly nothing. After 3 weeks I put 1000 USDT in and was reaping a 3% interest everyday. 

Fast forward a couple months,  obviously I have been speaking to this girl everyday and the trust levels are building. Last week, I deposited another 8300 USDT to boost it to 10,000. That way i get 3.5% of that everyday. She tells me she has over 100,000 deposited which means she gets 4.5% daily,  she makes 4500 USDT in one day... 

I've made 2,300 USTD in the last 6 days, since I increased my balance to 10,000. But it all seems way too good to be true?? Surely no one can make this much money a day, for literally doing nothing. 

This girl I'm speaking to now wants me to deposit even more to take advantage of even higher interest rates,  and it's making me suspicious. Could she literally take my money through the 3rd party DApp? 

I've already deposited money to my bank twice before and have been successful, so withdrawing the cash isn't an issue. 

I done some research on 'Coin Staking' and this sounds a lot similar to what I'm actually doing.  With coin staking, your essentially donating your crypto assets to contribute to the blockchain, and you get rewarded each time a transaction gets validated. 

I'm really hoping someone can help shed some light on what I'm actually involved in. I'm happy to answer any questions. 

Thanks so much!

**+2H after OP**

Yeah, I totally realise what a naive fool I've been. But thanks to the ones that have expressed hope/optimism/advice.  
She's now telling me there is a promotional deadline of the 20th March to boost my balance to 30,000 USDT or I can't claim a 2888 USDT reward. It's good i lied to her and said I had more money.

I'm keeping up the cute chats with her and she said she's going to phone me again tomorrow before the deadline, she's even telling me she's coming to the UK in April, lol.

I'm obviously 1000% attempting to pull everything tomorrow.

If the app doesn't let me withdraw or throws hurdles in my way, I'll go to her for help. (I did this last time as the app likes to throw obstacles in the way when it comes to withdrawing) She seems to know the app like the back of her hand. I'll tell her I want to withdraw all the money with the promise of putting 50K in there afterwards. If she just tells me to deposit, I'll say i want to get more familiar with the withdrawing/depositing process. 
If I can withdraw, I'm taking the £2,800 profit and will tell her I'll only deposit more once she comes to the UK and see's me next month. See what she says😂

Anyway, I'm sleeping. I'm a nervous wreck. Will update tomorrow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**2D after OP**

Sorry for the delayed update,  the weirdest thing happened, which I'll get to in a second.

Firstly, this is definitely a scam, I've been so naive to not realise. What I have fell victim to is something called the 'Pig-butchering scam' .. honestly,  look it up. A sophisticated scam, run by Chinese crime gangs, involving of romance and cryptocurrency. Some of the reddit comments said it involved the Chinese mafia, which is why I hid the post..
Apparently, the scam has been exhausted in Asia, and they are now targeting Europe and the USA. 
I think I'll leave this post up as an awareness thing, not that much of you would be as stupid as I have. It was the romantic gateway that really got me hooked into this, I got absolutely played. I read about one guy who invested 1.6m then lost it, poor soul.

Anyway, the weird thing...The night I wrote this post, someone's comment lead me to an article that explained there were 2 BitKeep apps (the app I was making a profit from), a real one and a fake one. I had a look and I 100% had the real app.

But when I woke up the next morning, I wondered if they saw my reddit post, because I realised that my app had mysterious changed to the fake one I saw on the article the night before. The layout is now sightly different and the logo has changed, but my balance is still in there.
I read that this fake app can store your your mnemonic information or transfer password when you type it in, so now im really reluctant to try withdraw. I honestly think if I had tried to withdraw when I had the 'real' app on the night I wrote this, I could have successfully withdrawn some, like I had times before.

The person I'm speaking to is happy to 'walk me through' the withdrawing process before I 'promise' to deposit more, which raises my suspicious that the app is now malicious. I don't think they have any idea i know.
I'm not even sure if they can get access to my wallet until I use the app to deposit/withdraw, now it's changed to the fake one and they can now store my info??
BitKeep said the best way to get the real app is to be directed straight from their website to the app store, but when I do that now, it only brings up the fake one (which has a white logo and a purple background, the real app has a blue logo with a white backround)

I'm wondering if there is a way to restore the app to the original,  I'm not sure if deleting it will work. My heart sunk when I woke up and saw the fake app, I then realised that I had been too late. But for now, it sure looks like my money is gone or at least locked into the app.

I'm still playing oblivious and maintaining communication with this person. If I can figure out a legitimate way to withdraw my money, and lure them in with the promise of depositing 5x more, I could be in with a shot.
But, that's probably me just being naive, again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**+4D after OP**

OH MY ACTUAL GOD, I HAVE ALL MY ORIGINAL MONEY + £1,700 BACK INTO MY BANK !!

So after being sketchy over opening the app the past 3/4 days, I finally tried to withdraw tonight. And it all went through really smoothly...
I don't think the app did change to a fake one, I think the app coincentally updated, I checked through a friends phone and his was the same as mine (Now a purple logo).

I have been keeping up my act with her, told her I wanted to withdraw the money I had in there, then deposit 20,000. She helped me through the depositing process  (I said I wanted to learn the wholee process before investing in it longer term) andd, It's all gone through....I actually can't believe it. I've just sold 12,300 USDT to a merchant, the money is now in my bank. 

I really don't know how to slowly 'cut off' this person I'm speaking to. To avoid depositing the 20,000 tonight, I said a family emergency came up. I've also told 'her' I have a 50K loan coming so this would buy me time.

I really have no idea why it has allowed me to withdraw with it being a scam, there were no big gas fees or nothing. Maybe they just let me thinking they are getting 5x the investment?

Either way, I feel so relieved and thankful to have got my money back, I must be of a small minority that have done. I will 100% learn from this, I'm really counting my lucky stars. 

The only other thing......Since I wrote this post, another 2,100 USDT has accumulated within the 'mining pool' I was in

Do I take it? I mean, I already have a profit and kinda know who I'm fucking with so probably not.

But if this is a mining pool, full of people who have fell victim to the same scam as me, who are not receiving interest, just a top up of everyone else's money in the pool. Do I just withdraw it? Instead of it going back to the scammers?

personalfinance,Paying for discount points vs higher mortgage rate? Not sure what makes most financial sense for me.,"Hi Everyone,

I recently had an offer accepted on a home after months of searching and around 13 offers made. Currently, I'm working with my mortgage loan originator to fill out paperwork, determine closing costs, interest rates, etc.

What I'm currently trying to figure out is if it makes more sense for me to pay for the points or keep the higher interest rate. The loan amount is 212k, and by paying 2% discount points ($4200) they will reduce my rate from 4.875 to 4.625. This comes out to around $32 less per month.

To me, paying $4200 for a 0.25% lower rate doesn't seem to add up. I feel like going with the higher rate and investing that $4200 in an index fund will yield more money over 30 years than the savings on interest. From my understanding, the discount points are tax deductible, so in reality it will be less than that after my 2022 tax returns. 

I'm in a good situation financially, so the lower mortgage payment doesn't matter much to me, and comparatively having the extra $4200 in my bank isn't that big of a deal when I have about 40k in savings leftover after the down payment and closing costs (not including my retirement accounts). The house is in good condition, and the only things that will likely need to be replaced/fixed within the next 3 years are the air conditioning unit and the furnace.

stocks,$MOO - An interesting play on agriculture/fertilizer,"The Vaneck Vectors Agribusiness ETF is a fund that holds positions in **Deere &amp; Co, Bayer AG, Nutrien and several other big name agribusiness suppliers, manufacturers and processors. $MOO has been on an upward trajectory for 5 years and has seen nearly 9% growth over the last 3 months. Overall, the ETF is considered a *safe* investment to keep in your portfolio for long term prospects. Recent volatile movement in the ETF has been mainly attributed to rising inflation, agricultural foods, fertilizers and the cost of distribution due to sharply rising oil prices.

As we all know, inflation is here to stay with the fed expecting more rate hikes this year. It's obvious that with inflation, businesses have no choice but to pad their profits and raise prices. We're experiencing this right now in the US and across the world.

The three largest holdings in the portfolio of $MOO is Deere, Bayer AG and Nutrien as mentioned earlier. Nutrien ($NTR) is the largest producer of *potash* and the third largest producer of *nitrogen fertilizer* in the world. Bayer AG ($BAYRY) is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world and has extensive outreach in agricultural chemicals, seeds and biotech products. Overall, the $MOO ETF has around **1.2 billion in assets**. 

One of the most important things to mention in this post is that UAN 38 and UAN 32 has moved over 140% and 144%, respectively, since last year (nitrogen fertilizers). Potash has risen just over 100%. Fertilizers alone are highly impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war fiasco in which **Russia exports account for 18% of the world's potash market, 20% of ammonia sales and 15% of urea**. Oh, and just a reminder... Fertilizer has been sanctioned as an export from Russia. These numbers give a direct reason to be invested in the space, at least for the next several months. 

If you're looking to make a play on the everrising prices of fertilizer and different commodities in the agribusiness sector then I'd love for you to do your own DD on $MOO. Options Implied Volatility is super low, even months out, while non-ETF focused stocks in the agribusiness sector are seeing insanely high IVs - and this means **that $MOO is a play you can actually get in early on before volume starts taking over**.

stocks,What Do You Actually Like Going Forward?,"So. I’ve literally held every stock I own thru this recent downturn in the market (the last 4 days have been awesome though and I’m still way up).

I’ve come to a conclusion about the market, and various subs on Reddit however, and have noticed the following: 

1) Interest rates are going up and will continue to go up this year. This is also not 2017 when interest rates were at their lowest level. As a result, tech stocks took somewhat of a beating when the announcement happened, but then literally an hour later started to rebound (possibly the biggest pricing in I’ve ever seen). So. With the idea that interest rates and tech are correlated, do we still like Apple, Microsoft, etc?

2) Covid. It seems that this issue is getting better in every part of the world (maybe minus China who are going thru an outbreak). I am a Canadian myself, so when Trudeau made the announcement that restrictions are going to ease in the travel sector, I would hope that airlines are going to inch upward. Also. Presumably. The supply chain will improve as people return to work, supply lines become better improved and unemployment decreases. With this in mind, do we like airlines, cruise lines, shipping companies?

3) The war. As a result of Putin’s bright ideas, he has single handily sunk his country’s economy. But this has also created massive waves in the global economy as we don’t really know how crazy this guy is. It seems that peace talks are happening, which I believe definitely affect the market. But then if the war ends, so what? What stocks are actually going to directly benefit?

I guess my point in writing all of this is my main question, so what? Are we now out of the tech era? Do we settle into well established ETF’s with dividends? I’m curious as to what people like moving forward, and their general outlook on specific stocks in the next 2 years.",finance,1647633498.0

CryptoCurrency,"Who doesn’t desire stability? To be able to minimize risks that come with volatility of assets. I mean in crypto some get rich, some go broke. I think it is important to rely on a trustworthy stable system.","Liquidity is really an important concept to understand when dealing with any assets guys, and especially in cryptocurrencies. I mean we already acknowledge that high liquidity in the marketplace is an ideal situation because of its improved prices due to the large number of buyers and sellers in the marketplace. But it also insures that prices are stable and not prone to large swings. Now we’re talking!

Speaking of liquidity, Polygon comes first to my mind. First, since the launch of Aave more than $12.5 Billion in total value has been locked by more than 30,000 users. And second, Polygon is basically one of the most trusted chains out there. 

I believe that in concept of decentralized protocol adoption, accessibility will always weigh higher than measures like market-cap. It’s kinda simple, I just want say that in a system where earnings depend on dynamics of borrowing and lending, there are various aspects of interest rates should be studied in order to have a better understanding.

Gonna give you a couple examples, deposit index is one factor. Although the trend in deposit index for all stablecoins on all chains is pretty much the same, APYs on Polygon are recognizably higher which means by depositing your stablecoins on MATIC, you would have definitely outperformed anyone doing it on other chains by a significant margin. And btw, the net increase in deposit volume when the market has been going through a lot of turbulence proves that users actually trust Polygon.

Another is utilization rates which is the ratio of total borrowed volume to total liquidity in the pool of coins. History actually proves that utilization rates on Polygon have been pretty high along with being constant when compared to other chains which indicates a higher demand of the capital from pools deployed on AAVE Polygon. 

You what’s also interesting?! It’s that as market gets deeper and stable, issues like growing interest rates can be taken care of easily, which shall again favor the stablecoin adoption on Polygon. It’s a win-win isn’t it?",cryptocurrency,1647645419.0
stocks,Fed Pricing Signals Larger Rate Hike at One of Next Two Meetings,"Swaps linked to Federal Reserve policy announcement dates now suggest that around 75 basis points of further rate increases will take place over the coming two meetings, which suggests that at least one move from the central bank will be bigger than the standard size of 25 basis points.

The contract for June suggests an effective fed funds rate of 1.08%, 75 basis points above where the effective rate is likely to be on Thursday after the just-announced 25 basis point increase is factored in. The Fed tends to move in increments of 25-basis-points, which means a 50 basis-point move is being priced wither for May, the next meeting, or June, the one after that.

The prospect that such a supersized increase will take place at the May meeting is around four in five, based on market pricing.

CryptoCurrency,One Year Alt-Coin DCA+ Experiment - Week 22 Update,"It’s that time of the week again (albeit a bit early this week). Thankfully this update is a bit more positive than the last.

For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi) as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the community to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my own research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some DD. I have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous posts and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be chosen by the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end of the experiment. For the starting point you can look here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/te474k/one\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment\_week\_21\_update/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/te474k/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_21_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I took the day off from work today and had a bit of extra time so I decided to make my post before the weekend for once. If you’re a longtime reader, you know I changed up the format a bit last week and I think I made it a bit easier for everyone to read. I also added some new components and this week I’ve decided to add one more thing. Since the experiment involves different purchases each week it can be difficult to keep track of what I’m buying, so I’ve decided to start adding a table showing the coins that were purchased this week as well as any staking/interest rewards that have been earned and finally a breakdown of which coins I’ll be purchasing next week. Here’s the initial version:

&amp;#x200B;

As for the week, my last post was on Monday and on Monday things were looking pretty bad. The macro environment was getting worse with the stock market looking abysmal as well and with the US Fed set to increase rates everyone was on edge. We still have the war in Ukraine looming over us, but the market seemed to react favorably to the interest rate hike imposed by the fed and we’re going into the weekend on a very positive note.

Let’s get right into the current financials:

&amp;#x200B;

Every coin with the exception of LUNA is up from Monday, with the clear winners being AAVE and AVAX (apparently 2 As and a V were popular this week). I’m not too worried about LUNA though, as I think we’re just seeing some profit taking after its huge run. Even my big loser so far, TRAC, is back to a point where it’s down less then 50%. All of this adds up to the bottom line that the portfolio is up about 10% since Monday. I’m feeling optimistic heading into the weekend and feel like there’s a good chance for BTC to hold the $41k level.

The financials lead directly into the performance graph for each coin in the project as well as the project overall. This graph shows that the overall portfolio is performing pretty well compared to the price of BTC over the time, so despite the fact that the overall returns are not exactly what I was targeting for my portfolio, I can’t be too upset with where we’re at today given what the market has done since I began in October.

Another new table I added last week shows the impact that implementing a DCA approach has had on the portfolio. You can see from this, that despite the negative returns so far in the experiment, the portfolio is significantly beating a portfolio that had made all these purchases up front.

personalfinance,Please help — mortgage interest rate / home purchase quandary,"Hypothetically speaking: in a very high cost of living area, on approximately $170K of annual income, would it be reasonable to buy a house for $1.15M? Assume downpayment of 20% is available, but would wipe out most non-retirement account savings (retirement accounts would remain about $115K). Interest rate of 4.11%, which is painful to think about given that 2.75% was available just a few months ago — but I guess it is what it is? 

Older home (~80 years old) is a modest 3 bedroom, 2 bath, ~1800 sq ft, needs lots of work (A/C installation, other appliances etc — could likely get some family help to cover some of this). Again, in a jurisdiction with barely anything coming on the market, and what does is routinely selling for $100K - $200K over asking, all contingencies waived, short closing, many cash offers, etc. 

Wife loves the home, which is extremely rare.

I am not sure how to think about the current moment. Interest rates are clearly heading up, so it seems like now is the time to buy. But prices are so incredibly high that I worry about buying at or near the top of the market and then, as interest rates go up, values drop as demand drops (and meanwhile, refinancing becomes no longer prudent). Possibly get stuck unable to resell when interest rates are now at 7%+? God forbid you consider moving within five years, which is definitely a possibility (maybe you can rent the place out?). But at roughly 40 years old, after moving around a lot, it feels like it may be now or never (or at least not for another 5-10 years if I miss this window?) to buy a home.

Current rent is ~$3,300 — significantly lower than the ~$5,500 mortgage payment it would require (including taxes/insurance).

I would greatly appreciate any insight that might help me sharpen my thinking around how to approach this quandary. Seems there are three variables and you can only have two of them, at least in this area: 1) homeownership, 2) living in a relatively desirable neighborhood/home with good schools for kids (per my wife), and 3) on a budget that doesn’t feel like intense pressure. [And I acknowledge the privilege woven throughout this post—it is of course all relative].

[Edit in answer to Qs: Only other real debt is ~$400/mo car payment. But after taxes/withholdings, housing costs (of new home), car, and fixed bills (utilities, subscriptions, etc), we would be left with about $2K/mo for all else. My wife just relocated here and likely will get a new job in the next few months (maybe in the $70K range). I worry about waiting the few months though as rates steadily tick up… next Fed meeting is early May…

Also, $1.15M is significantly above the list price, but possibly in the range of what would be needed to get the house.

The thing I'm wondering is what would be the best way to go about it? He is currently fully invested in Principal LifeTime Hybrid 2035 CIT X, a target date fund. Should he sell all his shares before rolling over to ME and just roll over the cash? Or would it just be easier to roll everything over as is and leave the investments in ME as is?

I know a lot of people on this sub talk about the million and a half dollars they’ve made on investments by the time they’re my age, and it makes it difficult to avoid comparison &amp; self-judgement, but that won’t get me anywhere but down. I would love to hear some productive thoughts on how I can move forward realistically and attempt to tackle this monstrosity of a debt, and hopefully eventually start some savings and investments as well.

personalfinance,First Time Tax Situations During This Year's Filing,"Hello,

If this is not the right sub, I apologize and ask that someone point me in the right direction...

We are a family of four, married, two kids and have always have fairly straightforward tax returns here in the US. We have set things up so that we end up typically receiving around $3-4K in a tax refund. 

Two things happened this year that I have never encountered before. 

1. Our salaries increased and we were told this message:  your Advanced Child Tax Credit was reduced because your Adjusted Gross Income was more than $150,000. In future years, contributing more money to a retirement plan could increase the amount of your Advanced Child Tax Credit.  *I already max out my Roth IRA contribution. Would maxing out my wife's Roth IRA lower our AGI?*
2. Both my kids (8, 4) had to file tax returns this year and owed both the federal government and state money from their UTMA accounts due to capital gains. However, we made no distributions. *Is there anything we can do to prevent this in the future?*

Thanks for any help, advice, or pointing me in the right direction.",finance,1647696435.0

I checked the irs sites multiple times throughout the last couple years, have tried to contact them via phone, but have never heard anything of it. When I filed my 2020 taxes I had to put my previous year AGI at 0.00 because they kept rejecting, saying there was nothing on file.   


I have bank statements that show  state return being direct deposited but, of course, don’t show my federal coming in. Currently I have statements going back to April 2020 but those will soon be expiring.

I’ve left messages on the machines for my state representatives, sent them emails, got nothing. I could still really use that $800 but at this point am I better off letting it go? What else can I do? It’s a lot of money and that was my time that I sold, I earned that money.",finance,1647700425.0
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto.com introduces 'Spending Power' - you can borrow against your staked coins with 0% interest if repaid within seven days. If the loan is not repaid within seven days, the interest rate is 9.99% thereafter.","Yes, that's right. Apparently the new 'Spending Power' feature let's you take a crypto loan using your staked coins as collateral... with 0% interest if that loan is repaid within 7 days. This seems like a fairly original idea as you continue to earn interest on any coins in Earn while being allowed to use those same coins as collateral for the 'Spending Power' loan. 

From what I've read, this new feature is already rolling out in Canada and the borrow limit is tied to card tier.

More importantly, this is a super convenient way to top up your CDC card immediately while waiting for fiat to be credited from your bank account to the CDC Fiat Wallet (and free due to that 7-day 0% interest period). 

Loans which are not repaid within 7 days then accrue interest at 9.99%.

As someone who was massively critical when CDC decreased the Earn Limit recently, that does now start to make a little more sense. More importantly, this will hopefully inspire other lenders (Nexo, etc) to start offering similar interest free loans....

personalfinance,"I have a large increase in my income coming, looking for advice around how to best structure my finances","I looked around for a post similar to my situation and couldn't find one, so here it goes. I am using a throwaway because most of my friends know my main account and I don't want them knowing about my financial situation.

I am a single US 29M residing in NJ with no debt, $225k in assets ($25k in savings; $125k investments; $75k 401k). I have a NYC lease ending in July, no immediate plans on what to do next. I own no property.

I have been working in tech on $160k/yr/avg for the past 3 years. I recently accepted a new job offer that is paying $365k/yr. I had no idea how much I was being underpaid until this offer came.

The comp is broken down as follows:

1. $185k salary
2. $75k RSU (vests quarterly, refreshes yearly)
3. $105k yearly cash bonus

I have very little idea how to best structure my finances going forward. Some concerns and observations:

1. My new employer's 401k match is very low, just 2%. I don't know if it's best to only do 2% or still try to max this. I also have no IRA or anything like that.
2. I would love to own a home but I feel like right now is not the best time to be looking, but renting for 10 years has drained all joy from my soul. Is this still a good idea?
3. My new job is remote but has pay zoning. The highest are NYC tri-state (me currently) and SF bay area, then falls off. I don't know the rate of drop-off yet until I start in two weeks.
4. The structuring of the pay is confusing me. I believe I will be taxed semi-monthly assuming I make $185k/yr (or maybe it's 185+75?) but the large cash bonus at the end of the year bumps me up a tax bracket, so I would like to optimize against this if possible.
5. Savings seems awful at the moment even with the planned rate hikes, but going bigger into investing given fed hawkishness and world peace uncertainty makes this route seem unattractive too.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am happy to provide more context or answer any questions.",finance,1647702287.0
CryptoCurrency,"9 years ago today, Hal Finney made one of his last ever posts: “Bitcoin and me (Hal Finney)”. It's a must read.","Hal Finney shared the following post on March 19, 2013. Every time I read it, I end up crying. Hal was paralyzed by this time and he was typing this message using an eye-tracking device.

 

“I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  


For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  


Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  


When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  


I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.  


When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  


Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  


After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.  


The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.  


Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.  


My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  


ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  


Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.  


It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.  


And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.  


That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.”",cryptocurrency,1647702671.0

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 21st, 2022.

# **Investors come off a strong week looking for more gains now that they have some clarity from the Fed - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/18/investors-come-off-a-strong-week-looking-for-more-gains-now-that-they-have-some-clarity-from-the-fed.html)**
*****
&gt; With the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike out of the way, market pros are now debating whether the market can continue the upswing it started in the past week.
*****
&gt; A powerful rally in technology and growth stocks helped drive the stock market higher in its best week of the year. The S&amp;P 500 was up about 6.2% for the week, ending at 4,463. The Nasdaq was up 8.2%, and the Dow gained 5.5%.
*****
&gt; Consumer discretionary stocks gained more than 9% as the top performing sector, followed by technology, up about 7.8%. Energy was the only major sector to decline, falling 3.6%.
*****
&gt; Some of the names that had been most punished like airlines, were among the biggest winners on the week. Airlines were up about 14.7% for the week. High growth names also bounced, with the ARK Innovation Fund, a poster child for growth, jumping about 17.4%. The fund is still down more than 46% over the last six months.
*****
&gt; Ukraine will continue to be a focus, and headlines could continue to create volatility in the coming week. Investors are also watching the course of Covid, which is causing shutdowns of Chinese cities and is spreading again at a higher rate in Europe.
*****
&gt; There are more than a dozen Fed speeches, including from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who appears at an economics conference Monday and at an international banking conference Wednesday. The economic calendar is relatively light, with durable goods and both services and manufacturing PMI released Thursday.
*****
&gt; “The anticipation of the first rate hike did more damage than the rate hike itself. We got ourselves twisted in a knot, starting in December, with the Fed pivot from transitory inflation to tapering” [bond purchases], said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That’s kind of behind us now as a headwind. That diminishes the impact that any parade of Fed speakers will deliver.”
*****
&gt; The market indeed ignored hawkish comments Friday from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who appeared on CNBC. Both said they want to raise rates faster than the median seven hikes the Fed expects this year.
*****
&gt; The Fed released its interest rate forecast Wednesday, when it raised its fed funds target rate range by a quarter point to 0.25% to 0.50%, its first rate hike since 2018. The Fed also said it would look to start reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet at an upcoming meeting.
*****
&gt; Tech and growth did well in the past week, and they are the stock groups most hurt by higher interest rates. They typically command higher prices because investors buy them for their future earnings, and easy money makes them very attractive.
*****
&gt; Strategists say tech can continue to gain in a rising rate environment, now that some of the excesses are wrung out of the group. But they may not be the leaders they once were.
*****
&gt; # Looking past the Fed
&gt; “I think the stage has been set by the Fed for investors to focus on earnings again,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI. “Bottom line...earnings estimates since the beginning of the year have risen.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he expects the market could continue to rise in the near term, barring an escalation of geopolitical events. While it appears oil prices may have peaked, he said it is still not clear whether stocks put in the low for the year.
*****
&gt; “Sentiment is absolutely horrendous...You put it all together, and we just think it’s a recipe for higher share prices looking out over the next month or two,” Emanuel said. He said investors are now able to discount the fact the Fed has begun its rate hiking cycle.
*****
&gt; “We’re there. We know what’s going to happen. We know they’re going to do 0.25% in May. We know they’re going to start QT [quantitative tightening] some time at mid-year,” he said. “They’re not raising rates enough that it’s really going to hurt the market and investors can focus on earnings again.” He expects S&amp;P 500 profits to be up 9.3% this year.
*****
&gt; Hogan said the market is leaning towards a favorable outcome for Ukraine, such as a cease fire, although no developments suggest an end is now in sight.
*****
&gt; “Everyone is leaning in this direction that this will come to an end in weeks rather than months,” he said. “If not, the market is going to have to recalibrate that.”
*****
&gt; # This is what the stock charts say
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, focuses on the short-term technicals of the market, and he said after a strong run, the market could digest some of its gains early in the week.
*****
&gt; “After an impressive week like this, most active traders are reducing risk into this [S&amp;P 500] 4,400 level, not adding to it,” said Redler. “If we could digest a day or two after quadruple witching that might give us some signals that this could continue towards 4,600.” The quadruple expiration of options and futures was Friday.
*****
&gt; Redler said Russia’s war in Ukraine and Fed policy tightening will continue to hang over the market, and that might keep the S&amp;P 500 in a range. “I don’t think anyone is thinking the market goes right back to all-time highs anytime soon,” he said. “I think we’re smack in the middle of a range. This is a very neutral spot not to get short and not to add to longs. We’ll see how we digest this next week. For me, I think oil put the high in for the year, and that could be helpful.”
*****
&gt; Oil briefly popped to $130.50 per barrel earlier this month, when investors feared sanctions on Russia would restrict its oil exports and create major shortages. Since then oil has fallen back, and West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading just under $105 per barrel Friday.
*****
&gt; Redler said an important test for the S&amp;P 500 will be to see if it can hold the top third of its range and stay above 4,330. “It if can hold that, the next move could be higher,” he said. “That would show commitment to this week’s actions.”
*****
&gt; Technology shares made a strong comeback, and Redler said he is watching to see if they continue to lead. “Tesla helped lead the way all week. A bunch of tech names did break their downtrends,” he said. “Tesla, NVIDIA and Amazon have been buyable on dips...NVIDIA gave clues that the bounce was as believable as it because it was one of the first stocks to cross its downtrend line.”
*****
&gt; Apple and Microsoft, both higher on the week, could be important drivers of the market in the coming week.
*****
&gt; “Apple and Microsoft haven’t been a headwind but they weren’t a tailwind. If they could outperform a little bit, they could help the broader indices,” Redler said. He said the two stocks, the biggest by market cap, were higher on the week, but they lagged the Nasdaq’s gains because they had they had large sell imbalances during the quadruple witching expiration.
*****
&gt; “The stocks with the biggest buybacks have the biggest selling imbalances,” Redler said.

&gt; # Beware the Ides of March

&gt; On the eve of the Ides of March DJIA registered an ominous 6thDown Friday/Down Monday of 2022 – emblematic of the entrenched downtrend and headline risk from the war, the Fed and inflation. The bulls are clearly on the run. But we can find some solace in the fact that support around the February 24 intraday lows held up again today. Though that support is admittedly tenuous. The next level of support is down near the March 2021 lows around DJIA 31000, S&amp;P 3875, NASDAQ 12500, NDX 13000. Russell 2000 seems to be finding support above 1900.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cb566a95677ef6730e6af62e91354560/4ae9229666a9009e-a0/s500x750/fc1f8b993b019d3d9b041176b6f8896af7223bae.jpg))**

&gt; Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. March is a volatile time for the market. It is the end of the first quarter, which brings with it Triple Witching and an abundance of portfolio maneuvers from The Street. And those maneuvers are currently being exacerbated by the war headlines, the Fed’s much anticipated first interest rate increase in years and high inflation.

&gt; March Triple-Witching Weeks have been quite bullish in recent years. But the week after is the exact opposite, DJIA down 22 of the last 34 years—and frequently down sharply. In 2018, DJIA lost 1413 points (–5.67%) Notable gains during the week after for DJIA of 4.88% in 2000, 3.06% in 2007, 6.84% in 2009, 3.05% in 2011 and 12.84% in 2020 are the rare exceptions to this historically poor performing timeframe.

&gt; Fear is high and sentiment is low – both near extreme contrary buy levels. Our friends at Investors Intelligence noted in their US Weekly Review that “Both Advisors Sentiment Readings and Selling Climaxes (25th February) indicate that significant market weakness is over for the time being and selected purchases can be considered.” March market trend reversals from extremes are not unusual as we experienced in 2000, 2003, 2009 and 2020. Any inklings of de-escalation would likely rally stocks.

&gt; # Bears Come Out of Hibernation in Spite of Rebound

&gt; In spite of the S&amp;P 500 gaining back some ground in the past week, sentiment has continued to shift in an increasingly pessimistic direction. For a second week in a row, less than a quarter of respondents to the AAII sentiment survey reported a bullish. At 22.5%, however, current levels are still slightly above the low of 19.2% from one month ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment meanwhile climbed another 4 percentage points with just under half of respondents reporting as such. Albeit elevated, bearish sentiment is not as high as the 50%+ readings reached in January and February. As for another reading on bearish sentiment from the Investors Intelligence survey, bearish sentiment is at the highest level since the March 2020 COVID low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread is extremely low at -27.3 but that is not quite as low as those past couple of weeks when over half of respondents reported as being bearish.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Not all of the increase to bears came from bulls. As shown below, neutral sentiment fell from 30.2% down to 27.8%. That is only the lowest level since the end of February. While bullish and bearish sentiment are both over a full standard deviation away from their historical averages, neutral sentiment is much more inline with its own historical average. Whereas all weeks since the start of the survey has seen neutral sentiment average a reading of 31.4%, this week's reading was only a few percentage points away.

&gt; # Craziness In Emerging Markets

&gt; Volatility in Chinese markets has caused the broader emerging markets ETF, EEM, to move aggressively to both the upside and downside over the last few trading days. Yesterday, EEM gained 8.05%, but the move came after the ETF moved 6.1% lower between last Thursday and Tuesday's close. All-in-all, the ETF round-tripped to the levels seen on Wednesday of last week, but EEM is still down 8.5% year to date. Since EEM began trading in 2003, the ETF has gained a little over 300%, which constitutes annualized performance of 7.7%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/EEM-since-2003-031622.png))**

&gt; The move yesterday was high relative to historical daily moves, ranking as the 13th largest single-day upside move in its history. Larger moves were seen during the Financial Crisis and the COVID Crash. Obviously, these are not great periods to be compared to, but the occurrences were near the bottom of the pullbacks.

&gt; # Poor Outlook From Homebuilders

&gt; After a small and brief pullback at the start of the month, the national average for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has continued to press higher hitting 4.46% as of the most recent reading from Bankrate.com. That is now the highest level of a 30 year fixed mortgage since the start of 2019. While the costs to finance a home have risen drastically, homebuilder sentiment has continued its decline. The NAHB's headline number on the subject fell another 2 points to 79 in March marking the third monthly decline in a row. While the decline in present sales was modest and traffic was actually up 2 points, futures sales were the major drag, falling 10 points to the lowest level since June 2020. That ties November 2018 for the third-largest month-over-month decline on record. The only two months with larger drops in this index were December 1987 (12 points) and April 2020 (39 points).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031622-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; Regionally, it was a similar picture in which one index saw far weaker results than the others. Homebuilders in the Northeast have seen sentiment collapse all the way down to 60 which is again the weakest reading since June 2020. While sentiment in the South has also fallen, it is nowhere close to as significant of a low. Meanwhile, the Midwest and West actually saw unchanged to improved sentiment.

&gt; # Continuing Claims At the Lowest Level Since 1970

&gt; Seasonally adjusted jobless claims continue to ping back and forth within their recent range between 200K and 300K. Still off the sub-200K readings from the end of last year, jobless claims fell from 229K to 214K this week. That is the lowest level since the last week of 2021 when they were 7K lower. Even though there has been no new notable low, the current level is still healthy and consistent with pre-pandemic levels that had not been observed at any other period after the early 1970s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Jobless claims continue to have seasonal tailwinds at this point of the year and typically do not seasonally bottom until several weeks later. The current week of the year has historically been one of the strongest in terms of consistency of declines in the non-seasonally adjusted number. Since 1967, 92.7% of the time claims have fallen week over week during the current week of the year, and this year was no exception. At 202.9K, it was only slightly above the low of 196K from two weeks ago. That level is also still slightly above the readings for the same week of the year prior to the pandemic (2018 and 2019).

&gt; Delayed an additional week making the most recent reading through the first week of March, seasonally adjusted continuing claims fell to a fresh low of 1.419 million. That is the strongest reading on continuing claims since February 1970.

&gt; # Housing Starts and Building Permits Raise the Roof

&gt; The latest data on residential housing for the month of February generally came in better than expected today and showed some positive longer-term trends. Starting with the actual numbers, Housing Starts increased 6.8% m/m, and while growth in multi-family units was higher than the headline number, single-family units still showed healthy growth of 5.7%. Building Permits actually showed a modest decline in February, falling 1.9%, but single-family units barely even declined. On a regional basis, despite weaker sentiment from homebuilders in the Northeast in yesterday's report from the NAHB, both Housing Starts and Building Permits in the Northeast grew more than 20% m/m which was easily the strongest showing of any region.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-Table1.png))**

&gt; From a longer-term perspective, the 12-month average of Housing Starts made another post-financial crisis high in February rising to its highest level since March 2007. Typically, this reading starts to roll over well in advance of a recession, so the fact that it's hitting multi-year highs now should provide some relief to those who are concerned about the flattening of the yield curve.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/031722-HS-12.png))**

&gt; It isn't just Housing Starts that are making new highs on a 12-month average basis. The 12-month average of Building Permits also ticked up to the highest level since February 2007.

&gt; Finally, the chart below shows the 12-month average of single-family Building Permits and Housing Starts. For much of the last year, the average of single-family units was starting to show signs of rolling over as supply chain issues slowed down activity in the sector. Given housing's leading nature relative to the business cycle, this was somewhat concerning, even if the issue was more supply rather than demand-driven. February's report, though, was encouraging in that both Permits and Starts showed increases again in their 12-month averages.

I heard that due to the Build Back Better Bill, people who live in states that haven't expanded Medicaid, I live in Florida BTW, can get a marketplace plan with a good subsidy amount so you don't have to worry about being uninsured.

Also, even if that doesn't fall through I read online that if you type your expected income as $12,881 (a dollar above the Federal Poverty Level) and if your actual income is lower, then you **shouldn't** be penalized with having to payback the subsidy, but I want to make sure.

I had stock options that amount to somewhere between 3-4% ownership of the company. minus of course, the initial investment, which was much smaller than the purchase price. i did not contribute to the initial investment so my cost basis is zero on options received. i guess that's what makes options different from shares. All in all I made ~250K cash up front and a large stock dump I am not allowed to sell until 1 year after the purchase date. then a few more stock dumps further down the line if i stay with the company. 

I believe my options were converted to shares right before the company got bought. Idk why exactly - to make things easier? because that's what's typically done? 
Nothing - in terms of my options - was actually officially done on paper until right around the closing date. All i had was an email basically saying ""you get x."" I know, crazy. they honored the email ofc - though my unvested options ""went away.""

So what I'm trying to figure out is how to pay taxes on the cash i received. What form do I need to complete for state and federal? I understand it's probably going to be taxed as earned income. I'm just not sure what forms to use exactly. Afraid I don't have the luxury of an accountant - tried emailing a bunch in the state I live in and no response. So I would appreciate any help/direction.

personalfinance,Better to pay off low interest debt or have a bigger down payment for a house?,"A little background: we’re moving, new job, new town. We’re about to sell our house and receive an estimated $150k from the sale. We have about $12k in private student loans at about 8% interest. $15k in federal student loads. A zero interest intro apr until august/2023 credit card balance of about $7k. And a $33k car loan at 2.7%. 

My questions: should we use the cash we get from the sale of our home to pay off some/all of the debt? Or put the full $150k towards the next house? We’d be using a VA loan so no PMI no matter the down payment. Which option will get us the best mortgage rate as well as a high pre approval limit? Is debt to income ratio more important than a down payment? Pay off just the student loans and leave the car and credit card cause the rates are 0% and 2.7%?

This next job comes with more pay and opportunities for growth. We’ll have the ability to pay off all the debt within the next 5 years or so if we chose not to pay it off now. 
There’s also a possibility we’ll want the cash for a remodel of the next house.",finance,1647724880.0

I just got out of a very toxic five-year relationship, with someone who was very bad for my financial health. I learned a great lesson though. I want to do everything I can to get ahead and out of this financial rut I’m in.

stocks,Anybody else feeling suspicious of the last week’s pump ?,"Looking at the pump before and after the FOMC meeting over the last week,  it is definitely feeling more like a relief rally to me and less of a rebound as people  are saying.
Dont get me wrong. I am still -$20k down on my portfolio of $100k but here is why i think we can go lower than March 13th low

1) This Setup feels like Late Jan-Early Feb when we hit a bottom right before the Jan FOMC on 27th and then relief rally &gt;6-7% on SPY from 420 to 446 over the early feb period,  then we started crashing again and reached a newer low right before the March 13th FOMC meeting (coincidence again?, I think not)

2) We are gonna see 5 more rate increases this year, and its definitely gonna impact earnings for high growth stocks, since now its more difficult to borrow. In 2018 we had  taper tantrum in Dec , when SPY annual return was like -6% for the year. FAANGs and Banks will continue to make money, but hard to see growth stocks doing the same

3) We still have crazy inflation never seen since the 80s, serious supply chain issues, war in Europe with troop mobilization equivalent to some of the WWII battles, new variant of covid hitting again with china under lockdown and interest rates rising.
Hard to see any positive catalyst in the next 1 year

Thats why I think  volatility and drilling might be back on the table around April- May.. right when earnings start show slower growth before the next FOMC happens. (Remember sell in may and go away?)

personalfinance,ROTH IRAs and the FEIE for a NY state resident,"Hi all,

My situation is a bit complicated, so here goes!

I was born and raised in New York State and keep a permanent residency there at my mother's address. However, I live and work in Hong Kong and reside and pay taxes here for all intents and purposes.  

Every year I take the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) so I don't get double taxed and I have no issue with this at the federal level, however, I recently learned that NY state is one of the only states that doesn't recognize this so I recently had to pay taxes for the 2018-2019 tax year, and I expect I'll get similar notices moving forward 2019-2020.

At this point, I have a couple options moving forward and ROTH IRA is part of my consideration. My father lives in Connecticut and I can shift my tax residency to there so I wouldn't have to pay state taxes (in the thousands of dollars) and avoid all of this. 

HOWEVER, I did move abroad before opening a Roth IRA, which is something I would like to do. I was wondering:

1) Can I open a Roth if I pay zero federal taxes, but I do pay state taxes? And:

2) Would it be worth it to keep my tax residency in NY state so that I can pay taxes in the US, thus allowing me to contribute annually to my Roth IRA, or would that simply be a waste of money.

3) Are there any tax deductions you are aware of, including something related to Roth IRA payments, that would allow me to minimize this tax burden if I were to keep my tax residency in New York?

I also have a 2011 MacBook Pro that once I fix it up will be a vulnerability testing machine for MacOS and a 2006 iMac that I don't have any idea on what to do with it - maybe flash Linux Mint on it and use it as a regular desktop for ""privacy"". I do plan on upgrading it later on. 

But the star of the show is of course my M1 MacBook Pro 13"" and the Thinkpad X260 - thinkpad is fully a kali machine while M1 is running a Kali VM in QEMU - haven't used it though so there's that, but other than that works great as a dev machine.

I was studying it today and the similarities are undeniable:















1. It happened when internet was starting to become a part of everyday life. Just like crypto potential was there, but the hype moved faster than the reality.(I doubt that Blockchain ever be nearly as important as internet tho)
















2. In dot-com bubble, Start-ups used investors money to throw massive advertising campaigns.
Spendings was reckless and most projects were not operational/profitable yet. Looks familiar? 
















3. Optimistic and excessive price speculation guided most dot-com investments. This further reinforced by media, investment firms and news of people becoming millionaire overnight. 
No comment really!














4. Federal reserve interest rate hike, court battles and most importantly first few failed dot-com enterprises all played a role in the market crash. 
Folks this one is a little too similar. I really do hope XRP fairs better at court then Microsoft did back then. No reason to panic tho.













5. Grow over profit mentality also played a role!

Now it all looks scary. After all most dot-com projects either got totally wiped out or lost most of their value. But in the end the surviving companies carried the torch. Amazon, Microsoft, ebay, today value much more than back then, and for good reasons. My point is, it is a part of any emerging technology, the hype, the fall, and the eventual rise.

Bought a house with the bank's money at an interest rate of 1.50%, keeping my own money and planning to invest it to pocket the difference. In my country there is zero capital gains tax.

I'll be needing the money again in about 7 years.

The only risk seems to be that when the market collapses like in 2008, I can't sell for three something years. My monthly income and what I'll leave on the savings account should cover expenses, and budget for that worst-case scenario.

I have been speculating on the market for some months, and understand the fundamentals. I have limited experience with ETFs, so I plan on making a basket, taking fees into account (DEGIRO has a core selection without fees), and asking the opinions of some reputable contractors on UpWork.

A periodic buy seems like the best idea. But if I buy €2K worth each week for a year, I already miss out on gains from the start. Nonetheless, it'd also allow me to gradually buy in whilst getting to know the true cost of owning a property.

ethereum,Stuff /r/ethereum should know: Proof of Stake edition,"As the merge approaches, more news and poorly informed crypto-journalist articles will come out, signaling to more people that it *is* indeed close, and this will bring more Proof-of-Stake related questions and discussions rehashing the same topics and same misconceptions. I've already seen this to a degree with last week's announcement that the Kiln testnet successfully merged, and I expect to see much more of the same stuff going forward so here are a bunch of common questions/takes I see, boiled down in quick bullet points like I did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about Ethereum in general.

I plan on lazily linking this thread whenever I see those points being brought up, and I encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if I got anything wrong or suggest any addition.

## Wat merge?

A lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light

* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.

* The Merge is not ""ETH 2.0"", there is no ETH 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/)

* **If you currently hold ETH, you don't need to do anything.** You will still hold the same amount of ETH after the merge, there is no ""ETH2 coin"", no need to migrate anything, etc. Everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood.

* It's called ""merge"" because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.

* If you don't know, ""consensus"" is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:

  * PoW: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.""

  * PoS: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.""

* Since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **Proof of Stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**.

## Why merge?

* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.

  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.
  
  * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.

* More sustainability:

  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)

  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network.

* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)

* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.

* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about externalities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)

## Wen merge?

* **There is no official date announced yet**. Just cautiously optimistic devs and community hoping for mid-June [for various reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/tbql1n/five_indicators_that_the_ethereum_merge_will/)

* Testing is still ongoing, the merge will not be shipped until developpers are fully confident that nothing will go wrong.

* I personally don't set my hopes up for June, but I definitely expect it over the summer, with the asterisk of ""unless something went extremely wrong during testing"" (e.g. a critical bug requiring weeks to fix, possible exploit in the specification itself require months of fixing and reimplementing)

* The difficulty bomb is set to go off in June, so there **will** be a hard-fork around that time, with or without the merge.

* I suggest bookmarking [wenmerge.com](https://wenmerge.com/) for a quick view of the latest estimates for each testnet merge that will lead up to mainnet merge, as they are announced.

## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.

* Some useless sementics first: there is no official date announced yet, and there never was. Can't have a delay on a deadline that never existed in the first place

* The quotes along the lines of ""Ethereum will switch to proof of stake by 2018"" came from a place of extreme optimism and of underestimating the complexity of not only a secure PoS design, but also a safe transition from PoW to PoS. The work done back then amounted to a partially finished specification for Casper FFG, a hybrid PoW-PoS mechanism that ended up being scrapped. But a lot is different today. None of these applied back then, but they do today:

  * There is a full protocol specification written that went through years of research, analysis of possible attack vectors and refinements

  * Client implementations are all done, it's all about testing now

  * It's all hands on deck on the merge, there is literally no other work being done other than the merge. All the necessary steps to lead to the merge are done. It's not even ""they're done implementing complex stuff like EIP1559, so more attention can now be focused on the merge"", it's: ""**all** the attention is focused on the merge"". There is no possible world where the merge ""gets delayed again"" and the devs start working on other stuff on the side. Until the merge is done, nothing else gets done. 

  * **PoS is literally running as we speak** in the form of the [Beacon Chain](https://beaconcha.in/) since December 2020. That's over a year of Ethereum's PoS getting battle tested in production (to a degree) with currently over 10 million ETH on the line. It just isn't producing blocks for the execution layer yet.

## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOL

For sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:

* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.

* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. So there's no ""opening the floodgates"" moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)

* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol

* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?

* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...

* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.

## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?

* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.

* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. 

* There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as ""but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing""

* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.

* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. 

## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work

* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.

* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:

  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in ""why merge?"")

  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards. 

  * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. 

* It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.

## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it

I don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable – unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world.

The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!

## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization

* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. ""Better"" or ""worse"" really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.

* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)

* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any ""it's centralized because X"" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say ""it can't be done because of X"". 

* Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. 

  * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. Sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall.

  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.

## PoS is really just ""who has money makes more money""

* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. 

* It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.

* ""*They may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*""....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network?

## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo

* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with ""proof of stake is nothing new""

* There's still ""work"" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. 

* It's not really ""free money being printed out of thin air"", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:

  * Opportunity costs – Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?

  * Illiquidity – From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.

  * Inherent risks – It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.

  * Volatility – at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)

  * Maintenance – You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. 

* Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. 

* As far as inflation goes: Let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)

* ""*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*"" 

  * The goal has been ""minimum viable issuance to secure the network"" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.
  
  * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.

  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap – decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace – once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.

* So yeah, there's no ""central Ethereum bank"" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. The market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates.

## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers

* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.

* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)

* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both ""amount of ETH staked"" and ""value of ETH"" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack — *once* — and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)

## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much

* I agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure.

* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block.

* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. 

* Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the ""not your keys not your coins"" mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization

* Related to above, stuff like Rocket Pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than ""just a staking pool"". I go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested.

## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW works

That's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.

It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.

stocks,Question: Why are residential mortgages primarily fixed rate over 30 years if inflation constantly eats at this fixed yield?,"Let’s assume that a lender originates a fixed 30 year mortgage loan at 4% today.
If inflation is kept at 2% like the FED ideally would like (let’s assume the world is perfect and this rate can be kept locked for the full 30 years), that means that the 4% rate on the mortgage and thus the yearly total payments the lender is receiving, is losing 2% of its value every year. If we take a look at year 30, (let’s assume the borrower never refinances or sells the property) the lenders effective rate has fallen to 2.18% for the final year.

Why do lenders originate fixed rate mortgages if the fixed rate will begin to lose value almost immediately upon origination and ultimately the desired yield is significantly lower towards the end of the loans life?

Do they instead price the rate higher, let’s say 6%, so that after 30 years of inflationary loss the yield is actually 4%?

Was wondering this, thanks in advance for the input!

personalfinance,Would you sell your house now to pay off student loans?,"My wife, child, and I live in a small Midwest city with a very low cost of living. We were originally considering moving within the next year or two, undecided if we would stay in the same town or move to a different part of the country. However, we've recently been considering selling our house asap to take advantage of the market before more interest rate hikes this year. 

Here are some numbers:

* We currently have about $12,000 in checking and savings accounts (not including investments).
* My wife and I have no credit card debt. 
* Our combined salary is $135,000 per year.
* My wife has no student loan debt, I have about $45,000 of low-interest federal student loan debt. We've spent the last few years focusing on getting hers paid off and are ready to focus on mine (currently paying $400 per month)
* Our current mortgage payment is $770 per month. Utilities are about $300 more per month.
* The townhouse we are looking at is $1500 per month.
   * Has some utilities included. 
   * Puts us in a better school district and we could send our child to public school instead of paying $220 per month for the private school she is currently enrolled in. 
   * Much closer to my work, would save me about $100 in gas per month.
   * Cost per month would be almost the same considering the above.
* Our only other monthly payments are for two vehicles, insurance, cell phones, and internet.

We owe $93,000 on our house, which recently appraised for $127,000 in early 2020. Home prices in our area have gone up since then and we've done some small improvements, so our reserved estimate for a new appraisal would be $140,000. 

Assuming we could net about $40,000-$45,000 from the sale of our house currently, the thought is we could knock out all of my student loans. The townhouse would require a 24 month lease which, in theory, would be enough time for us to save money to put down on a new house once we've decided on where we want to live.

So...would you suggest we sell our house and rent a townhouse instead so we can pay off my student loans immediately? Or are we better off staying put and riding out the housing market uncertainty ahead while putting more money down towards my monthly loan payments?

I told him what I had always been told: if you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than you are now, put it in the Roth. But I did the math and while the Roth IRA is clearly better, it didn’t actually seem to make as big a difference as I had expected.

Can someone take a look at my math and let me know if I’m missing anything here? Is something wildly off about my assumptions? Thanks!

Assumptions:

* Tax rates will not change between now and retirement.
* He made $30K last year and will have an income of $60K per year in retirement.
* Whatever money he does not have to pay in taxes on contributions to a traditional      IRA, *plus whatever saver's credit he gets,* he will put into a mutual fund in a brokerage account and hold.
* 7% annual return on all investments.
* *Added: For the sake of easy estimation, assume that he takes the whole value out at once. I realize this is not how it will actually go down.*

**If he puts the $6000 in a Roth IRA and keeps it there for 30 years:**

His 2021 income was $30,000. After the standard deduction of $12,550, his taxable income is $17,450. He will have to pay $1,895 in federal income taxes. His $6000 contribution has been taxed at 12%: $720 in taxes paid on this contribution.

After 30 years, his investment will be worth $45,700, and he will not have to pay taxes on this.

**If he puts the $6000 in a traditional IRA, puts the tax savings in a brokerage account, and keeps them both there for 30 years:**

His 2021 income was $30,000. He deducts the standard deduction and his $6000 contribution. His total taxable income is $11,450. He will have to pay $1,175 in federal income taxes. His $6000 is not taxed—he has an extra $720 to invest in his brokerage account.

After 40 years, his $6000 investment in the traditional IRA will be worth about $45,700. If his annual income is $60K per year in retirement, withdrawals from his traditional IRA will be taxed at 22%. So he ends up paying $10,054 to the government and keeping $35,646.

His $720 will be worth about $5,500 in 30 years. He will have to pay a 15% LT capital-gains tax on this: $825. He keeps $4,675.

After taxes, he has $40,321 between both accounts.

personalfinance,Confused about employer HSA contributions,"I've been trying to file my taxes. I changed jobs late last year and the confusion is from the job I had for most of the year. Ever since I put in my employer HSA contributions from the 12 section into my taxes, the amount I owe for both federal and state has gone way up. This doesn't make sense to me. The money from my HSA that I spent was used only on approved medical costs, I didn't max it out, and I didn't transfer the money anywhere else. So I don't understand how I owe more for this. I also never had any money in my HSA from any employer. All of the contributions were from my income. I called Healthequity who I had the HSA with to ask about this and they confirmed that my employer didn't contribute. At this point, I was under the impression that this may have been an error on my W2. However, I looked at old W2s from 2020 and I see that they also show employer contributions to my HSA which was also with Healthequity. 

I'm so confused and I think I just don't understand how this works. Shouldn't this money have shown up in my Healthequity account? Shouldn't I have access to it? And why does having an HSA cause an increase in tax owed? I want to make sure I know what is going on before I file.",finance,1647817548.0
cybersecurity,"My consciences can't hold on anymore, regarding entry level cyber security/IT job opportunities, a truth telling session from someone who 'made' it to a senior level job","Since I joined this subreddit about 2 weeks ago, I have seen so many posts asking a related question in regards to entry level cyber security/IT jobs. Since then, I have also watched many videos hosted by many cyber sec youtubers about this same topic, and for the love of god and my conscience, I can’t hold on to my real feelings and conscience about this topic anymore. I feel like I need to have a place to tell the truth from the ‘inside’, from someone who by your judgment probably counts as ‘made it’, and to let everyone who is concerned about this topic share their real thoughts here. My goal of this post is to let people who are still waiting on the sidelines to get a REAL sense of what’s going on, not some curated content on YouTube or half assed answers you get from somebody here. And for that, I will tell you guys my story from the very beginning. This is going to be a long story, so grab your popcorn and sit tight. (If anyone who questions the truth of my story, I am happy to share with you my professional LinkedIn profile if you msg me privately) 

&amp;#x200B;

Like many of you who asked this very question, I was just like you in 2015. I was a first gen immigrant to the US, and was in my early 30’s. I spent my 20’s doing exactly two things: serving in the US military, and then getting my cyber security degree from a legit school using my GI Bill (My military experience was not an IT related job). When I graduated, I was in the same situation as many of you, waiting on the sidelines, wondering if I could get my dream job, a job with real benefits, a real salary (not hourly or contract), with great co-workers in a great location, and future career growth prospects. I did a bunch of stuff during school to prepare myself for such a job after graduation as well: 2 IT related fully paid internships doing MSP/help desk stuff, totaling 2 years of related experience. I was not in good shape health wise: I have a debilitating back injury that needs surgery soon, so getting a good job lined up with good health insurance with low deductibles was absolutely necessary for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I had prepared well: I graduated with a 3.5 GPA, had paid internship experience related to my job, only thing I missed was a few certifications, buy hey, this is in 2015, where CEH was rumored to be the ‘it’ cyber security cert (LOL), and few the guys in my grad class had any kind of IT cert as well, so I didn’t put a lot thoughts into it. I started to apply for entry level jobs in anything related to tech: IT system admin, cyber security, software. What follows is the typical story you see here on reddit: not many replies, the ones who did interview me on the phone or in-person, are your no-name local small businesses that have no future career growth possibilities and pays less than $50k to start. Most of those jobs are still help desk, nothing really cyber security related, let alone all the fancy stuff like software development. The most interest I got from any place was an entry level help desk position for a local retailer in a dump for $45k, and the recruiter on the other side of the phone had told me “this is a very high offer”. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can imagine my disappointment at that time, thinking I had put nearly 10 years worth of my time, my youth, my hopes, dreams, and energy into this moment, only to come out like this. I ended up giving up my job search process, and after my college graduation ceremony, I traveled outside the US for a 3 month trip. When I got back to the US, I was a man in my early 30s, living in my mom’s place, with a bad back that would prevent me from doing anything physically challenging. I was in a dire place, doing exactly what many of you did that asked the same questions here and on YouTube: where are all the entry level cyber security jobs at? I thought there is a shortage of such people doing such jobs? What’s going on? 

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day when I was laying on my bed lamenting about my situation, one of the guys that I did my senior capstone projects with in college called me out of the blue. He was my PM during that project, and I also happen to know he was second in my graduating class, as he had the second highest GPA in the entire few hundred people who just graduated with me. He started asking me if I had really worked in the US military before, and he happened to find this job with a small defense contractor doing software development. There was an opening for an entry level position within this company, it was not doing cyber security work, but software related stuff. So he asked me if I was okay to do this job, and of course I said yes, given the situation that I had at that time. He then gave me some tips for interviewing, and set me up with his manager for an interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I got hired, this job turned out to be everything I had ever hoped for. I started at $60k a year with every benefit you can think of, the company was located at one of the most beautiful seaside town in the world, this guy who recommended me for this job also managed to find me a cheap pad to live in somehow (And a year later when he left for greener pastures elsewhere, I took over the lease of his pad for a relatively cheap price). Career wise, no I was not put into a position to do cyber sec related work right away, but the company was willing to train me from the ground up, even though at that time, I hardly knew how to write ‘hello world’ in Java! Oh, did I forget to mention the great co-workers that I had? The office that i worked in was small, probably 20 people total, that included the senior management team of the entire company, so I was able to work face to face with some of the most qualified and experienced systems engineers there. I was so happy, I knew in that moment I had got ‘it’, it being the entry level job everyone who went to college hoped for they will get, and one moment I was hopelessly laying on my bed, to the next moment I am well on my way to a promising career with great pay and benefits. With this knowledge in hand, I didn’t waste my time the next 4 and half years. With this job, I barely ‘worked’ during my 8 hours of time that I had to sit in the office: I probably had a real 8 hour working day less than 1 month out of all my time I spent there, rest of the time? I spent my free time at work and a few hours after work to hone my cyber security skills: I studied and earned my Security+, CEH certifications while at this job. After I got my Clearance, I left this job to work at a national defense contractor for a six figure position (50% pay raise), and while I was there, I got my Certified Kubernetes Admin cert, which prepared me to jump to another fully remote job last year (Another 50% pay raise and my current job). 

&amp;#x200B;

So when I see someone that asks “where are all the entry level cyber sec positions/how to get one of them”, I know what you mean, you wanted what I had to start my career that got me to where I am today. A job that has great pay and benefits, and great bosses/managers that gives you fertile ground and time to grow, lets you do your job without overwhelming you with work, pampers you while you learn to provide value to the working world. Now that I have got out of that entry level job and have served in 2 different companies, I can tell you such experiences in any field are the rare exceptions. Trust me, I know, else I wouldn’t push myself so hard to continue to leverage my good luck. But of course, I want to write here about why such positions are so hard to come by, especially when it pertains to cyber security/IT. Now that I am in a senior cyber security engineer position, what I really want to say is “How the hell you guys dare to be gatekeepers once you get here to all those guys on the sidelines”, but after I hold that thought for a bit, I think it’s more complicated than that (Yah enough about my stories, time for what’s really matter to you, the reader). 

&amp;#x200B;

What happened really is, time has happened and tech has shifted. What does this mean? I will write here in my own experience: back in 2015, many companies were still just starting their own GRC and cyber engineering department. Most of those companies still have part of their legacy applications hosted within their own data center, probably ready to jump on the cloud computing/microservices app train. Back then VMware certs were the darlings of the industry, along with the traditional networking stack like CCNA/CCNP and such. Cyber sec were the new guy on the block, and many companies, due to the position that they were in, had money and time to take on brand new grads that are also looking for an ‘in’. I remember many of the guys in my college class who got jobs at Cisco, Crowdstrike, and a few other smaller MSPs that do pen tests with not much experience in IT. Fast forward to today 2022, most of those companies had already done the transition from their monolithic legacy app hosted in an internal datacenter with VMware to a microservice based app hosted on Kubernetes in one of the big cloud computing providers, not to mention the “working from home” shift happened thanks to COVID. What the above big shift in tech is that people like me, who was able to find an ‘in’ back in 2015 timeframe, and who were doing whatever that had to be done to keep our skills current, are now ripping the fruit that is happening in tech during the last several years that you were in school. This means that cyber sec went from a field with many entry level openings to a field that is largely needing only mid to senior level practitioners in a matter of few years. The technological factors that enabled us to get our foot into the door have largely been gone, yet the education you just received in school was geared towards a time in the past that is no longer in the present. So now, I have seen new grads that are at least twice as qualified as the most qualified guy that I knew when I graduated, trying to apply for a job that is beneath the technical level of my first entry level job that I mentioned above, for less pay and no one bats an eye for it. Not me, my consciences can’t hold on to that, I feel bad for you guys who are on the sidelines today looking for an in, because when I was you, I was in a much worse situation personally but I was lucky that I got what I needed and I was able to leverage that opportunity to the promised land. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cyber sec Youtubers are the ones that disgust me the most when I research about this topic. Almost all of them are one of those few guys that ‘made it’ like me, yet none of them acknowledge their survivorship bias, and amazingly, all their talking points are the same! Get this cert, do this networking, do some CTF. My ass, haha. All those things should be on the job training, just like what got you there today. This probably ruffed a few feathers, but go ahead and reach deep down and tell me what I am saying here isn’t true today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Truth to be told, I was able to secure my current job in a senior role in cyber, only because the other guys on my team currently had no experience in working with software engineering, and I had no experience working with any cyber security team yet, so a mutually beneficial opportunity had united our interest (Plus the company that I work for now got a windfall of business thanks to COVID and the money printing madness that happened afterwards). This is how I am able to get a cyber security job with technically zero experience in cyber but a few certs. Once again I knew this is very ‘unicorn’, so I didn’t sit and rest and I have gotten my first security specialist certification in one of the big three cloud computing providers to show my new team my capabilities and willingness to learn new things. My salary over the past 5 years that got me here are as follows: $60k - $72k (internal raise) - $110k (Job change) - $150k+10% (current job). If you think this is high, remember that guy who got me my dream entry level job? We graduated college at the same time, he is now a senior cyber program manager at a major company, making $230k a year plus bonus. And he isn’t even the highest earning guy I know, another dude is a manager of software engineering not even in a FANG company, set to make half a million this year. Amazing how in just a few years away from college, the distance between each individual and their own career is already this far apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the real kicker: you still have hope to do a ‘side twist’ and get your foot into the door of cyber security. There are still many critical job skills that are very lacking in today’s cyber security engineering teams. One of the most crucial skills that I will recommend here is the Linux command line. I am constantly amazed at just how many people working in tech that don’t know a lick about how to use one of the most amazing software ever composed in human history, the Linux command line. I know software engineers that had to use Git GUI to do their pull requests because they don't know how to use the Linux command line. Hell I didn’t know how to use it either, I got introduced to it during my studies for the Kubernetes certification. This is why I am going to be gunning for Linux certifications, especially the red hat ones next. The web that you see today, including Reddit, are hosted in Linux. Docker containers are lightweight Linux OSs. Yet most people I meet working in cyber security are older folks who lived and died by using Windows server and PowerShell, few had any experience in Linux, and even worse, few know what is the real difference between a monolithic app and a microservices one. Pen testing will require you to run a bunch of commands in Linux as well, one of the security advantages in Linux is that you can lock down commands down to the flag level if you want to, knowing how to do this will set you apart a lot in your entry level resume. Things change in tech a lot, but it is not immune to the Lindy rule: things that have existed in time for 30 years, will survive for another 30 years at least. I don’t see how Linux will go away, since it is already launched to planet Mars, and probably will be the OS of choice in the upcoming space age. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kuberentes is another thing you can work on to bolster your chance of getting into the door: it is the VMware of yesteryear. This is what visualizes the hosts that docker containers run on today. Terraform and Cloud are also popular, but I think those things will change before we know it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, none of those things are very ‘entry level’ by the standards that I had when I went to school, but times have changed, and if no one was willing to give you on the job training, those are the things that you can work on to show that you have got an edge over others. This is what I have been observing since I started working in tech. Unlike many others here, I have done exactly 0 CTF, done 0 GitHub projects, went to 0 cyber security conferences, yet since I got the “on the job training” that everyone thinks should be the norm but is not, I was able to leverage that opportunity to where I am today. For people that had similar opportunities compared to mine, please stop telling those guys waiting on the sidelines to do those things, you know that’s not what got you to where you are today. Yes, doing them will add some points, but that’s not the main reason. Knowing the right person while you are in school is just so much more important than anything else, catching up to the latest technology while still upkeep on the tech that never changes is also important once you get your foot in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok the rant from my conscience is over. For people looking for entry level jobs into cyber security, let me know what I can do to help you. And I’d love to see more people here sharing what “really” got them to where they are today, instead of all the standard talking points. New guys on the sidelines don’t need them, they have been hearing them all their lives. They need insider information that will help them get an edge during interviews, direct them to the right resources, and hopefully be able to make up for the non-existent luck that they were not able to get.

personalfinance,I need help filling out Form 8962 as a new independent filer!,"My tax return keeps getting rejected with the error: The e-File database indicates that Form 8962 or a binary attachment with description containing ""ACA Explanation"" must be present in the return.

This issue is that Form 8962 IS attached, but my special circumstances might be messing it up. I had federal health insurance under my parents from January to July, then moved to my job's insurance. I am filing as independent this year for the first time, so I need to fill out Form 8962 and allocated 0% of the tax credit to me. I filled out the form with this in mind, and pretty much everything says zero except for line 2 that has my personal AGI, and line 30 where I have (a) the policy number, (b) my parent's SSN, (c) allocation start month = 01, (d) allocation stop month = 02, and (e,f,g) as zero.

Some clues to why it might be getting rejected are:

* I submitted it first with allocation months 1-7 and the tax return was accepted. However, this had me owing a lot money in taxes since it meant I allocated 100% of months 8-12. This doesn't seem right to me, as my policy ended in July, so I shouldn't be owing tax credit repayment for those months. My parent's paid for all of the policy, so that's another reason I think it makes sense for me to allocate 0% months 1-12.

personalfinance,How can my parents in poverty invest for retirement without losing federal aid?,"I'm in my late 20s with no debt (other than a mortgage at a 2.99% interest rate). We have emergency savings, and I'm maxing out Roth IRA and working towards maxing out 403b. We're comfortable. My parents (mid 50s), on the other hand, have been living paycheck to paycheck their entire lives and surviving off of welfare. They have absolutely nothing saved for retirement. I would like to start giving them an allowance of sorts, like $500 a month that they can maybe put towards a Roth IRA. However, I'm afraid that if my allowance increases their income or assets, they will lose their federal aid like SNAP and Medicaid, which could make my assistance a wash. What are ways that I can support them financially that avoids the risk of losing their federal assistance?

https://puck.news/netflixs-new-math-a-wall-street-travesty: “*I was asked the other day where I see markets headed, with a war in Europe and a global oil shock compounding what was already a gnarly tangle of Covid-era supply chain disruptions. The Federal Reserve, after a decade of spiking the monetary punchbowl, is finally beginning to raise rates. As America’s financial bubble hangover begins, this person asked me, where does the smart money go?

Alas, despite the rally last week in the equity markets, we are just still at the beginning of the cyclical downturn in the financial markets. Investors are eager for some sign that we’re turning a corner, such as a pullback in the price of oil, but credit markets continue to swoon. My favorite bellwether, the yield on the average junk bond, closed at 5.94 percent on Friday. At the beginning of 2022, the yield on the average junk bond was 4.35 percent. That’s a difference of 159 basis points, or 37 percent, in fewer than three months. 

What that means, generally speaking, is that anyone who bought a junk bond in early January at a price that yielded a 4.35 percent return has now lost as much as 37 percent of the market value of that bond (depending on the bond of course), since the price of a bond is inversely related to its yield. If your financial advisor encouraged you to buy a junk bond at the beginning of the year, thinking that 4.35 percent yield looked attractive, not only were they badly mistaken, but the value of that bond staring you in the face, day-after-day, has gone down substantially after not even three months. No one feels good with a 37 percent loss in their portfolio, even if they can hold the bond to maturity—7 years? 10 years?—and hope for the best, that it pays off at par. It could also lose more value of course, or the company that owes you the money could go bankrupt, reducing the value of that bond much closer to zero than to 100. I dare say if the stock market had fallen 37 percent in fewer than three months, the financial crisis that would be brewing across the country would share some space on MSNBC with Ukraine and the pandemic.
*
*But since most people don’t understand the bond market, or realize it even exists, this kind of major repricing goes underreported or unnoticed. But I promise you that on the bond desk at Goldman Sachs the traders have noticed, as have Goldman’s clients—pension funds, endowments, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds—many of which thought a 4.35 percent yield was just grand in a zero interest rate environment. But, in fact, that low yield for a bond containing that much risk was an awful investment idea, as I have been writing about for years now. 

It was a travesty of risk assessment. When you loan money to a company with less-than-stellar credit—an issuer of junk bonds—you had better be getting properly compensated for the risk you are taking. That does not mean 4.35 percent (or even less last fall, when the average junk-bond yield touched below 4 percent—egads!). Back in the days when Mike Milken ruled the roost, investors wouldn’t touch a junk-bond unless it yielded 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 percent plus warrants, which were equity kickers that were attached to the junk bond (and that occasionally Milken took for himself). In other words, investors wouldn’t go near the risk inherent in a junk bond unless they were getting rewarded seriously for the risk they were taking. 

So what happened? I don’t know for sure, but a big part of it has been the Federal Reserve’s so-called Zero Interest Rate Policy, or ZIRP. When safer bonds yield close to zero for some 12 years, a bond yielding 4 percent can start looking pretty attractive, I guess. Not to me. I have argued that the bond market has been univestable for years—with the notable exception of March and April 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, when everyone freaked out and the yield on the average junk bond was 11.5 percent. That was a great time to invest in the bond market! 

In any event, ZIRP is now ending, and it looks like the Fed may well raise interest rates at every one of its meetings this year in order to fight inflation. The Fed also looks like it will be stopping its aggressive buying of bonds—known as Quantitative Easing—that has increased the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet ten-fold to $9 trillion. As the Fed continues to raise short-term interest rates and winds down Q.E., the yield on the average junk-bond will move past 6 percent and probably get closer to 10 percent. Along the way, you will probably be able to hear the wailing from all those people who thought buying a junk-bond that yielded less than 4 percent made sense. When you do, think of the haunting Edvard Munch 1895 pastel “The Scream,” which another junk-bond aficionado, Leon Black, paid $120 million for in 2012.*”",finance,1647831436.0

Edit 2: Wow you all are amazing, thank you again! Also if you disagree with a comment please don't down vote them. I appreciate all perspectives! 

Long story short I'm a recovering alcoholic. Spent years making less than 40k/year, drinking, and racking up credit card debt.  I have good credit (730ish) and my cc has a very low interest rate, but it's at like 9k right now. 

A year ago I met my current partner and my life has turned around. He got a great job working from home and I just got hired on also. We'll both be making 40k a year from home. 

I have an old 401k from a previous job with 9.9k sitting in it. Haven't messed with it since 2017 when I lost that job. I thought about taking the money out to pay off my debt, but I'm getting conflicting information. IRS website says it's taxed at 10%, vanguard looks like it's taking out 20%, and someone said it gets taxed like 50%. 

Should I use this money to pay off my CC debt? If so what am I actually getting taxed on it? Also any general advice for getting my finances on track is helpful in addition.

personalfinance,Should I take advantage of the high I-bond rates right now over Roth or paying off my debt?,"I've read the subreddits here that seem to encourage to pay high interest debts first, then IRA and investing.

After subtracting emergency funds, I have around $18.5k that I can use. I have \~$13k left of student loans at 5% interest rate (not planning on touching my other frozen federal student loans for now). My company don't have 401k so I plan on opening an account for Roth. But I am also highly interested in the current 7.12% I-bonds, which has a limit of $10k per person. Since the I-bonds are at a high rate right now, does it make sense to max out the 10k, and then the remaining towards my 5% student debt? or what about Roth?",finance,1647840896.0
bonds,Basic Question - Fed Funds rate and impact on long end of curve,"I have a straightforward question in which I hope the answer is not “it depends”.

Hypothetically, if the federal reserve shockingly increased interest rates 1% at the next meeting, what would happen to the long end of the curve? I believe the short end would increase dramatically.

Conversely, say the fed decreased the fed funds interest rate back to 0% at the next meeting, the short end would obviously plummet. Would the long end go up or down?

I’m hoping this question is economics 101 and not like many things where the opposite actually happens. Ie “The stock market went up on a poor jobs

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14). There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union."" Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

Here’s some analysis of the EU MiCA draft language guessing that there’s a good chance it will pass today (March 14) but that it might be removed during “Trilogues” which will be the subsequent informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission.

Bitcoin,A Nice Slow Acting Orange Pill,"I had a nice conversation last week about bitcoin with a nice neighbor who happens to work in the stock market.  Here are some paraphrased quotes:

OP - original poster (me)

SN - skeptical neighbor

SN: \[Tells me about his business\].

OP: Do you trade or hold bitcoin?

SN: No.

OP: Would you mind if I explain why I do? \[manners my friends\]

SN: Sure, it could be interesting.

OP: I think that one of the most useful things about bitcoin is that its monetary policy is set and predictable.  There will only be 21 million coins ever.  This in comparison to fiat currencies like the United States dollar where the printing is done according to whichever policy makers are running Washington D.C.

SN: What is to stop someone from changing that?

OP: Two things: 1. Bitcoin uses a combination of public and private keys which include SHA-256, the highest standard in cryptography similar to what your bank uses.  2. Bitcoin has validators and miners.  Validators check to make sure that every transaction follows the protocol and miners stamp the blocks of transactions every ten minutes.  If a miner stamps the block against protocol then the validators will not accept the block.  If the miner stamps the block correctly they get a reward.  Right now the reward is 6.25 bitcoin.

SN: That's $250 thousand!  They get that kind of money?  All of them?

OP: It is about $250 thousand but only one miner gets it every ten minutes.  It's kind of a lottery.

SN: Can I mine?  \[He's asking this because it sounds like a scam.  Why should the miners get extra bitcoin?\]

OP: Yes.  You can mine from your personal computer but you will likely lose money because the electricity is so expensive.  Today miners use dedicated computers that are specifically made to mine bitcoin and they use the cheapest electricity in the world.  \[I understood that he thought it sounds like a scam and so I explained to him that mining is not a free lunch.\]

SN: Okay.  Here's my problem.  Let's say that this is really that great.  What is the use case?  People aren't using bitcoin now and they probably won't be in the future.

OP: We're eventually going to come to a point where you will walk into your shop and the owner will say that he is only accepting bitcoin.  Inflation in the dollar will be too high.

SN: When that happens life will be pretty awful.  I'll have much bigger fish to fry if we come to that.

OP: Actually, right now in Argentina there is 40% inflation and life still moves on.  People there are begging for dollars.

SN: How are we going to get everyone bitcoin if there is a fixed supply?  How will we grow?

\-----

That's about where the conversation ended.  It was getting late and I needed to go and so did he.  It was a nice conversation and I think that there may come a day in the longer future that he will consider bitcoin as a savings vehicle.

If I was quicker on my feet I would have said that the challenge of getting everyone bitcoin will mean that bitcoin will become very expensive as the demand for it will fly through the roof.  I wasn't.

TL;DR: Have a patient conversation with an intelligent person and give him an opportunity to think over bitcoin.  He may or may not accept it, but that's his job to do his own research or ask you more questions.",cryptocurrency,1647852588.0

Bitcoin,Rolling over a loan to live off your BTC- anyone done it?,"I've read about some people doing this. I'll use easy numbers for the example. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You have $500k in BTC. 
2. Put up $250k in BTC as collateral to take out a $100k loan at 40% LTV ratio. The interest rate is 10% after one year. 
3. At the end of the loan, you take out a *new* loan for $110k to pay off the original loan. Assuming you can use the *same* collateral, you now put in an additional $25k for a total of $275k in BTC collateral at the same 40% LTV ratio. At 10% interest rate of the new loan, you owe $121k.
4. The next year, you need to pay back $121k, so you put in an additional $27.5k to get to $302.5k collateral amount at 40% LTV. 
5. Rinse and repeat. In the first few years you may lose anywhere from $25k-$30k per year on the compounding interest rate, but you assume that Bitcoin will increase in value over time, allowing you to make up for this loss. 

Main risks would be custody of the BTC and getting margin called, but since you already have $500k in BTC the chances of your collateral getting liquidated are pretty low.

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed after the benchmark’s best week since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures were little changed in early morning trading Monday after the benchmark index’s best week since 2020.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down about 80 points, or 0.2%, as Boeing dropped more than 6% in the premarket after a China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737 passenger plane crashed. S&amp;P 500 futures were near flat. Nasdaq 100 futures ticked down 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Last week, the three major averages notched their best week since November 2020, boosted largely by growth stocks. The S&amp;P 500 surged 6.1% from Monday to Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week 5.5% higher, and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite spiked 8.1%.
*****
&gt; “After one of the best weeks in years, now the question is will stocks be able to hold those gains?” said Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 recouped nearly half of its correction losses last week as investors received highly anticipated clarity from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates for the first time since 2018. The central bank signaled it expects to raise rates at its remaining six meetings this year.
*****
&gt; Market participants are also monitoring the war between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned if peace talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin fail, it would mean the start of a “third world war.”
*****
&gt; Ukrainian and Russian officials have met intermittently for peace talks, which have failed to progress to key concessions. Ukraine has also rejected an ultimatum to surrender the city of Mariupol to Russian troops.
*****
&gt; Oil prices rose about 4% on Monday, with Brent crude above $110 a barrel, as European Union nations considered joining the U.S. in an embargo on Russian oil.
*****
&gt; Investors are also evaluating a rise in Covid cases in Europe stemming from an emerging variant.
*****
&gt; Some market strategists are not convinced of the rally in stocks.
*****
&gt; “Bear market rallies are the most vicious. The rally in equities over the past week was one of the sharpest on record. While it could go a bit higher ... we remain convicted it’s still a bear market and we would use this strength to position more defensively,” Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson said in a note Monday.
*****
&gt; The economic calendar is relatively light this week but several companies report earnings. Nike and Tencent Music report quarterly results on Monday.

personalfinance,"Trying to buy a house on Cape Cod, pay my student loans, and invest in my future at the same time, ita not working.","A little background. I'm 29 years old, and make 70k on paper. Up until this past October I was paid 40 hours pay check and cash after 40 hours. With that system I made more money, but didn't help when applying for mortgages. My boss put me on salary so I could get a mortgage. Im now pre approved for 375k. 

Right now I currently owe one 17k loan and one 19k loan from college. It's getting harder and harder every day to try and buy a house with my approval, rates are increasing rapidly, and with a single income houses in my price range on Cape Cod are hard to find.

Im debating making a 17k payment, basically my potential down payment, on the 17k loan that has a 10% interest rate. 

I have stopped my ira contributions recently trying to save as much cash as I can for the potential of a house popping up but am tempted to just get rid of that loan. 

My thought is to pay the loan off, save all summer again, should be able to stack about 20k, and look for a house this fall, or suck it up and look for something to rent. Getting harder and harder to live with my parents at this age too.

In summary, is it a good idea to put 17k at a loan or continue saving and hope the housing market gets better?


Thanks for all the advice, seems there is a general consensus that buying right now isn't the right idea. Need to focus more on that big loan and hope the market turns around.",finance,1647868253.0
CryptoMarkets,Witch-hunt has begun: Russia vs Ukraine – CEX VS DEX,"One of the most widely broadcast wars in recent memory has been the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Decentralization and control of the financial system have also been major topics. As for national security concerns, many countries will probably have to reconsider their positions on Bitcoin acceptance and deployment.  


Ukraine has received bitcoin contributions, while Russian oligarchs have transferred their wealth into cryptocurrency in order to avoid their assets being frozen or confiscated.  


Crypto exchanges operate as banks for digital assets. They are broadly divided into two categories: CEX and DEX. In many ways, centralized exchanges are similar to traditional banks. Also, these platforms have rules and regulations and are generally regarded as easy-to-use and trustworthy. The KYC process is usually required.   


I became fully aware of DEX since I began using my first DeFi platform, KAIBA, not long ago, and I also understand that DEX eliminates the intermediary altogether and functions as peer-to-peer marketplaces where smart contracts and atomic swaps are used to conduct transactions. Traders are responsible for their own money and are liable if it is misplaced, for example, when their private keys are hacked or payments are delivered to the wrong location.   


Now consider all of this in the context of the war. Shutting down the accounts and actions of users in the decentralized system appears to be a near-impossible process. Federov noted this and stated that the “Ukrainian crypto community is ready to provide a generous reward for any information about crypto-wallets of Russian and Belarusian politicians and their surroundings”. Seems like a witch-hunt has begun.",cryptocurrency,1647874993.0
personalfinance,Understanding Bond Funds and Interest Rates/When to Sell?,"A little over a year ago I put a chunk of savings into an intermediate term US treasury bond fund in hopes of making a little more than the close to non-existent interest rates on a savings account in exchange for taking on a bit more risk. Unfortunately, that fund has been in the red for the entire time and in the past couple months has dropped precipitously (for a bond fund).   


This is money I'm hoping to have available in a 3-5 year window, but was hoping to do a little more with than just have sitting in a savings account (especially given the inflation outlook). But I'm worried I may have made some dumb foolish mistakes. Can someone explain to me the outlook for treasury bond funds as relates to interest rates and inflation? Given that there is expectation of increased inflation and raising interest rates would it be reasonable to eat my losses and reinvest that money elsewhere or just hold in a CD or savings account?   


Obviously no one can predict these things, but I thought I'd made a good decision and am realizing I may not have due to the low interest rates at the time of investment, so am looking for some deeper understanding of the bond market before I make some decisions on holding or not.

personalfinance,"Fellowship was ""disbursed"" on December 2021, but federal and state taxes are not withheld until January 2022. How to report it in 2021 tax return?","I have a weird situation. For context, I am an international student under F-1 visa in the USA, but I have been here for long enough to be a resident for tax purposes. I am filing my taxes as MFJ with my wife who already has an ITIN, with a dependent (daughter was born here).

So, I received a fellowship for my Spring 2022 semester (January - May 2022) to finish my dissertation. I ""received"" the money ($10k) in my student account already in December 2021, but it was not applied toward tuition and fees until January 2022. The remaining balance for my stipend was not reimbursed until 2022 as well. However, there was a slight hiccup with campus finances and they did not withhold the federal and state taxes in time. I had to pay back these withholdings in 2022.

I have called the finance office to see if I should expect a form 1042-S for this fellowship for the tax year 2021. They say that I will instead receive a 1042-S next year because the taxes were not withheld in 2021, but in 2022. Nevertheless, the $10k amount, including how much of it was used for tuition and fees, were stated in my 1098-T form for 2021.

Now the tricky part is in filing my taxes for 2021. Should I still add the $10k fellowship to my income in 2021, since the amount was listed in my 1098-T for 2021, or should I include it for next year's return, because I will not get a 1042-S for 2021? I would appreciate any information that you could share about this.

On a side note, is there any free file software that supports filing 1042-S as a resident alien? I tried asking TaxSlayer and their customer rep said that it cannot be done with them. I can probably work around the limitation by reporting my fellowship as miscellaneous income and putting withholding properly, and the numbers shown in their 1040 after me doing this look reasonable, but I do not know if such workaround will introduce problems.

Thank you very much in advance!",finance,1647877696.0
CryptoCurrency,Why doesn't Polygon get the recognition it deserves? The growth this chain has seen is incredible and it has the numbers to back it up.,"Polygon has grown a ton this past  year, a metric shit ton to be exact. I frankly don't understand why the  chain doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I understand some might  say it is centralized but I don't think it's nearly as centralized as  other chains who get more recognition that they don't really deserve  IMO. Mainly Solana and Cardano, I think Polygon trumps them both despite  also being centralized for now.

I  am going to be showing you just how much this chain has grown in one  year with all the charts to back it up, this way no moon farming trolls  can come and make up numbers or deny said growth because it's all there  in front of your faces.

Let's  start with the amount of unique users. March of 2021, The Polygon PoS  chain reached 200K which was a huge milestone at the time BTW. A year  later that number is over 139M, I'll leave how much growth this is in  percentage for you to calculate and get blown away by on your own.

https://preview.redd.it/n966kx04dro81.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf7c8003e3ce2d69a3887e6c389bd11b8d7cf410

 Someone is obviously going to come  out and say ""BuT AnYoNe Cn MaKe Address"" and you are correct. This is  why I'm going to be including how much growth the daily active users  have seen. This used to hover around 5-7K last year and right now it's  hovering around 300-400K.

https://preview.redd.it/uf1nra27dro81.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7ac612bf30568cbc0c5bd0c384d079f7a378e2

 You can't really talk about any chain  without talking about transactions and a few other things that I think  are important. For now let's just get to the transactions. The chain  used to average around 200K each day and it now averages around 3M on a  daily basis.

https://preview.redd.it/odwu93abdro81.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a60b7c705b2e55fe0a0af0f1510b964918860f5e

 Also according to [data](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-developer-ecosystem-hits-new-milestone-with-over-7000-dapps/?utm_source=Twitter-Main&amp;utm_medium=Tweet&amp;utm_campaign=Tier-1-Announcement)  from Alchemy Pay, 55% of projects have integrated solely on Polygon  compared to 45% on Ethereum. I think this will becoming a lot more  common but that's just my own personal opinon.

Finally.  I'm someone who truly believes that developers are at the heart of ANY  ecosystem and any chain. Polygon knows this experiencing massive  developer growth with the number of teams building on Polygon doubling  every two months since mid last year according to MoralisWeb3 data.

&amp;#x200B;

 This has been some of Polygon's  growth objectively by the numbers. Without including the amount of  growth they've seen on Opensea and huge major brands they've been  working with. You may think it's centralized, it's a shitcoin, etc and  you have the right to think whatever you want to think. All I'm saying  is, this kind of growth is nothing to be scoffed at and the numbers  don't lie.",cryptocurrency,1647877899.0
personalfinance,Use emergency savings to get out of debt?,"I’m 32 and bring in roughly $5,000 a month after taxes (though this can vary between $4,000 and $6,000 depending on the month). I have roughly $62,000 in student loans (@ 5.875% interest) and recently bought a new  new car and owe about $27,000 (@ 3.9 % interest). I have roughly $19,000 (after capital gains taxes are paid) conservatively invested in a brokerage account which I consider to be my emergency fund to cover things like loss of income. I’m currently undergoing a career transition. My first career was in healthcare but am in grad school and transitioning into data science. I’m currently employed part-time as a data science consultant while I work on finishing my PhD. I could easily more than double my take-home pay by going full time with this firm and feel moderately secure in my part-time position. The CEO has told me they would love to have me full time after I graduate. If things go south, I know I will always have good job security in my healthcare career and be able to easily count on 70-80k a year, but I’m burnt out and don’t want to continue doing that long term.

I recently listened to a Dave Ramsey podcast where he advised someone in a similar position to use their savings to get out of debt as quickly possible and then start building savings back up once they are debt free. I’m planning on downsizing to a studio apartment that will free up around $1,000 a month that I can devote to aggressively paying off debt. 

I’m thinking about doing a modified version of Ramsey’s plan and use the funds in my brokerage account to pay off a large chunk of my car loan and then with the extra $1,000 a month I would save by moving, I could triple up on my car payments and have my car paid off in under 6 months. Once I’ve paid off my car, I’m planning on using that extra $1000 a month towards my student loans and hopefully have them paid off within 5 years and use the extra $500 a month from not having a car note to rebuild my emergency savings by maxing out my Roth IRA contributions. Due to bad decisions in my 20s, I’m just now staring to save for retirement and only have about $16,000 in between my IRA and an old 403b account I plan on rolling over.

Does this seem like a sound plan? I really like having roughly 19k available as a nest egg and it hurts whenever I think about cashing out my brokerage account 😅

EDITS: thanks for everybody’s feedback 😃. I’ve edited to include interest rates on debt. I’ll also add that I usually stay one month ahead of all my living expenses in my checking account, this effectively gives me a small 1 month e-fund in addition to a $1,500 rainy day fund that I keep for unexpected expenses in a regular savings account. I figured that this would give me some margin to figure out how to liquidate my brokerage if I ever needed it for a larger emergency. I understand it’s unwise to invest an e-fund, but the thought of keeping that much in an account that only gives 1% interest makes me feel sick to my stomach. Based on everybody’s feedback, I’m thinking about slowly liquidating it and starting to tier i-bonds. The only downside I can see would be poor liquidity for the next year, but I think I should be able to weather small emergencies with my 1 month of living expenses checking buffer and rainy day fund.",finance,1647878690.0

And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.""","https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/21/powell-says-inflation-is-much-too-high-and-the-fed-will-take-necessary-steps-to-address.html

&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday vowed tough action on inflation, which he said jeopardizes an otherwise strong economic recovery.

&gt;“The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,” the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for the National Association for Business Economics.

&gt;The speech comes less than a week after the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years in an attempt to battle inflation that is running at its highest level in 40 years.

&gt;Reiterating a position the Federal Open Market Committee made in its post-meeting statement, Powell said interest rate hikes would continue until inflation is under control. He said the increases could be even higher if necessary than the quarter-percentage-point move approved last Wednesday.

&gt;“We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,” he said. “In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

...

&gt;As he has before, Powell ascribed much of the pressures coming from pandemic-specific factors, in particular escalated demand for goods over services that supply could not meet. He conceded that Fed officials and many economists “widely underestimated” how long those pressured would last.

&gt;While those aggravating factors have persisted, the Fed and Congress provided more than $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus. Powell said he continues to believe that inflation will drift back to the Fed’s target, but it’s time for the historically easy policies to end.

&gt;“It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain,” said Powell, whose official title now is chairman pro tempore as he waits Senate confirmation to a second term. “In the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.”

&gt;Powell also addressed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying it is adding to supply chain and inflation pressures. Under normal circumstances, the Fed generally would look through those types of events and not alter policy. However, with the outcome unclear, he said policymakers have to be wary of the situation.

&gt;“In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks,” he said. “However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.”

&gt;Powell had indicated last week that the FOMC also is prepared to begin running off some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets on its balance sheet. He noted that the process cold begin as soon as May, but no firm decision has been made.",finance,1647880843.0

personalfinance,Use equity to pay student loans?,"I’m a new doctor with, as you’d expect, a large student loan burden - $430k at 6.8% (currently 0%). My husband and I now make $400k combined, before taxes. We’re both maxing out work-based retirement contributions and have about $100k in savings. We have no other debts besides our mortgage, which is $3100 per month at 2.8%. We also have 3 kids and pay a nanny at market rate, ~$750 per week. This expense is likely to decrease by half or more next year when the youngest goes to kindergarten. The housing market is insane where we live (a major city that is growing rapidly). We purchased our home in 2018 and we estimate that current market value is approximately $600k higher than purchase price. We don’t plan on moving anytime in the next 5 years, at least. We just refinanced last year, but I wonder if we should take out a home equity loan to pay off my student loans and then pay that home equity loan off quickly, within 3-4 years. My entire salary minus retirement and 529 contributions could go towards paying this off. The home equity loan would certainly give us a lower interest rate and would be dischargeable, unlike student loans, in case anything were to happen. 

Is this a bad idea? Am I missing anything? Obviously, I would no longer be eligible for any loan forgiveness (PSLF is not an option for me and I don’t qualify for IBR plans due to having had earlier undergrad loans prior to going back to school for a medical degree, even though they were paid off a few years ago), but I have come to doubt that any meaningful forgiveness will ever come to fruition, anyways.",finance,1647882020.0

personalfinance,Refinance or Trade-In (considering todays market),"I have a 2019 base model Subaru Crosstrek that I love, but if I had one complaint, it would be it could use a few more horses under the hood. Otherwise, I'm 100% satisfied with it. I still owe just under $9k on it, the original loan being $22k, 72-month @ 7%. It's currently got 43k miles and blue books at about $20.5k in todays market.

I'm expecting some magic to happen with my credit score in the next few months and I've been considering refinancing for a lower interest rate. But then I got to thinking, with used car prices being so inflated right now, might it be a better idea to trade it in for an upgrade?

The Limited and Sport models offer those few extra horses I'm looking for as well as a host of other features, starting at about $30k. If the dealer were to give me the full trade in value of my current car (which I know they likely won't, but it should be close), that'd give me a down payment of $11k and a loan comparable to my original one, only hopefully with better interest and term. This would also net me a newer, better, safer car.

personalfinance,Is it worth a refi to drop my PMI?,"Some numbers

Purchased in 2020 for

$420k.

2.95% interest rate

PMI is $289.28 /mo

Mortgage payment in total is $2289

House is currently valued around $600k

$19,074 is the total cost of PMI left (Set to fall off in 2027 so rounded to 5.5 yrs)

\*My current brokers rules are not to drop the PMI unless 20% LTV or a Refi is done. They will not do it just based on the increased value. IF I were to Refi I would probably cash out an additional 20-30k to do some further home improvements we have planned.

Is it worth the refi to get rid of the PMI but take a higher interest rate with todays rate? This isn't a ""forever"" home but def a 5-6 year if I had to estimate.

personalfinance,Understanding tax credit for EV/PHEV,"Hello everyone,

I recently started a new job that has a pretty lengthy 45-minute commute.  I am currently getting crushed with gas (much like most of the country).  Unfortunately leaving in the northeast means my heating bill is astronomical.  I'm considering upgrading to a plug-in hybrid if the numbers are favorable.  I'm trying to understand a tax credit.  What I read is that it said it only applies if I owe $7,500 at least (for the federal one on electric vehicles).  What I'm confused about is that I received a refund but certainly was responsible for $7,500 in taxes through the year.  I'm assuming that if I am eligible for the full credit, the $7,500 just gets applied when I do taxes and I would see a significant increase when I do my refund? Thanks!",finance,1647886223.0
personalfinance,Pay off student loans in one go or make payments?,"25F, gross salary is 46,500 plus a part-time job that nets me around 1,000/month. I owe just over 26k in student loans. Due to a short stint in grad school and the covid pause, I've never had to pay toward them, but likely will once they un-freeze in May.

I have enough savings to knock out the entire balance in one payment, which would bring me huge peace of mind, and would allow me to keep using my biweekly income for savings &amp; retirement. I'd also have some savings leftover if I did this. However, I don't want to throw money away if the feds decide to cancel loans. I'm also in a field that supports PSLF, and could likely save a little bit in the long run by doing this.

CryptoCurrency,"Extremely fascinating power point presentation given by MIT Economics professors to the Bank of Brazil about the uses, benefits, costs of CBDCs and the technology behind them. Super interesting read, highly recommend to anyone interested in what a CBDC would look like.","**Role of CBDC, Digital Real in Brazil Relative to Existing and Planned Infrastructure Alternatives**

Robert M. Townsend 

Elizabeth &amp; James Killian Professor of Economics, MIT 

Webinar Series “O Real Digital” (Digital Real) Opening session: “Potenciais do Real no formato digital” (Potential of the Real in digital form) 

Banco Central do Brasil 

July 29, 2021

&amp;#x200B;

**Outline of the talk**

* Smart, programmable contracts 
*  Definitions and designs, various options for Brazil, and a potential role for some kind of central bank infrastructure platform, including the possibility of CBDC 
* Delegation to the private sector: innovation
* Imperfect competition: Public sector has an active role when there are IO concerns, including CBDC coins and smart contracts as competition for DeFi 
* Blueprints: Needed for the design of the financial system, a plan 
* Database: Data management as part of optimal financial system design 
* Regulation: By the public sector using smart contracts, encryption and CBDC Money and monetary policy: The natural domain, and gain, from CBDC

&amp;#x200B;

**Smart Contracts: Programming Code**

* Mechanism design problem 
* Max weighted sum of utilities of agents, participants 
* Subject to resource constraints, information incentive constraints, limited commitment constraint, participation constraints 
* Consequence 
* Internalizes incentives to “tell the truth” 
* And to take specified actions, follow the recommended plan, consistently 
* Smart contracts as code 
* Coded instructions to execute applications and solutions to mechanism design problems 
* Not related to distributed ledgers per se 
* Could be separate or could use, go with CBDC, it is optional 
* Cryptography
* Privacy for incoming messages, outgoing messages with signatures, and generates commitment 
* Prime example: “Trustless” escrow service (hashed timelock contract) 
* Consequence 
* Dealing with strangers, no need for trusted third parties, e.g., for financial access 
* More efficiency, flexibility, and potential to reduce rent extraction

&amp;#x200B;

**Schemata for Designs, Examples**

https://preview.redd.it/5k5l9ksywro81.png?width=715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffbcac8876e71f02d57ee0017b40daa7a88c6ccc

* Auctions with more privacy settings concerning bids and no trusted third party 
* Flexible financial risk-sharing contracts 
   * Halfway between full insurance and rigid borrowing-lending 
   * In mechanism design terms, as in Townsend (1982, JPE), and Townsend (1988, JME)
* Financial and information infrastructure for SMEs, a proposal 
   * As in Townsend, Sztutman and Zhang (2020)

&amp;#x200B;

**Implementation of Programmed Contracts in Brazil: A Choice of Designs**

* The limitations of CBDC on distributed ledgers 
   * Validation on decentralized distributed ledgers does not scale up easily 
   * **Solutions include better algorithms, e.g.,** **Federated Byzantine, Algorand, etc., not Ethereum** 
   * Or trusted centralized party running the ledgers, including partitioned ledgers, as with Corda 
   * Data storage and calls on the data: A scaling problem for transactions processing if not done correctly 
   * Potential solutions in the code itself or as hybrids off-chain 
* PIX: Debit and credit balance sheets, not on distributed ledger
   * Current option: Build on top of PIX, as with open banking 
      * Buyer/seller with shipping, invoice financing and hence change of recipient of funds, DvP for real assets such cars, real estate, interface with other digital authentication platforms 
      * However multi-party is more difficult, plus this path is one application at a time, may have limits 
* Open platform as infrastructure, providing tools to write any contract 
   * Example: EvryNet, no connection to central bank, BOT 
* Options for Brazil 
   * A public provision of such an open platform 
      * Not involved with the contracts per se, let the private sector do that part 
      * Multiple private sector platforms which are in principle interoperable (as evidenced by hashed timelock) but not yet clear how robust this is 
   * In principle separate from CBDC, but could do both, with fiat as legal tender for the object transferred, but not necessary to suffer from costly validation routines 
* Domestic CBDC has other, additional rationales, described in the subsequent slides

&amp;#x200B;

**More on Decentralized, Delegation to Private Sector**

* Price competition for commodities or assets among platforms, broker-dealers as go-betweens, calling out terms of trade and trying to attract customers 
   * Works well 
   * Especially taking the limit as the number of providers increases 
* Extends to mechanism design contracts with flexible options, pooling across large numbers 
   * Mutualization and securitization 
* Increasing returns are not necessarily a problem 
   * Finite number of clusters, with internal intermediation 
* Externalities as in two-sided markets also not necessarily a problem 
   * Payment cards, crypto currencies 
   * Problem of scaling up means increasing marginal costs, limits size, fixed costs not an issue

&amp;#x200B;

**Industrial Organization Issues When There Are Few Providers: Another Public Sector Role**

* Imperfect competition in the provision of financial contracts is an issue 
* Small numbers problem, profits vs. welfare 
   * Tradeoffs: Lower obstacles may give counter-intuitive results 
   * Can hurt the public and help banks that extract more rent 
* Identifying which frictions hurts the most 
   * Joaquim, Townsend and Zhorin (2020) 
   * Artificial product differentiation creates rents for financial providers, there is a large gain to getting rid of this 
   *  Lowering spatial costs as with digital banking 
   * Both provide larger gain relative to increasing number of physical bank branches 
* Public sector as providing competition for private sector 
   * Assuncao, Mityakov and Townsend (2021) 
   * Commercial banks provide insurance, credit, and savings 
   * Private sector banks act to preempt others in order to capture rents 
   * Role for public bank that cares not only about its own profit but also about public welfare 
* CBDC provision to ensure competition 
   * Public infrastructure 
   * Ensuring a healthy market in decentralized finance, DeFi
      *  NFTs, machine learning, credit scoring, customized contracts, new sources of collateral 
   * Making sure the benefits of private intermediation accrue to the public by competition from CBDC coins and direct or indirect programmability

&amp;#x200B;

**Even with Competition, Need Rules, Need Blueprint, Design of Financial System**

* Ex ante competition is good, ex post competition is bad, undercuts mechanism design incentives 
* (Below, as time permits) 
* Design remedies for pecuniary externalities, fire sales 
   * As in Kilenthong and Townsend (2021) 
      * Do not need government involvement via restrictions on saving, portfolios, taxes 
      * As in Stein (2013), auction for future Fed reserves, create market and price 
      * Here fees for joining ex ante security exchanges for assets with commitment to unwind these in corresponding spot exchange at pre-designated price 
      * Intuition: Type-specific fees are incorporating contributions to excess demand (or supply) which influences the price 
* Intermediaries can be key 
   * As in Townsend and Xandri (2021) 
      * Fixed costs/minimum scale leaving aggregate risk 
      * Firms and households required to go through intermediaries
      * Stretching to extend number of projects means ex post funding is not balanced 
* Coordination in innovation: Not the usual regulatory categories

&amp;#x200B;

**Database as Part of Optimal Financial System Design (as time permits)**

* Rules for credit registry 
   * Immorlica, Sztutman, Townsend (2021) 
   * Adverse selection 
   * Optimal designs of credit registries with AI and commitment 
   * It may be optimal to be constrained in information provided to investors to prevent market from unraveling, plus need to prevent new entrants from undercutting 
* Trade reporting rules 
   * With Garrett, Lee, Martin and Townsend (2020) 
   * Broker-dealer with bid-ask spreads in OTC markets for clients, coupled with subsequent inter-dealer market for re-trade in order to re-balance 
   * Post trade disclosure and third party platforms: Restrictions to not sell information on trades, as this exacerbates the adverse selection problem and dries up liquidity from dealers 
   * Better to provide no information or all of it and not to price it 
* Atomic swaps are not a panacea 
   * With Lee, Martin and Townsend (2021) 
   * Atomic swaps limit reneging and the limited commitment problem 
   * But to prevent information leakage, trades are limited, not contingent
   * Illustrative of a problem with partial innovation 
   * Rather than the design of entire system, the latter recommended here as the ideal

&amp;#x200B;

**Regulation Using Smart Contracts, Distributed Ledgers, and/or CBDC**

* Financial stability concerns: Bank (market) runs have a solution with smart contracts, in particular with cryptography and commitment 
   * Deal with problem directly through evolving caps on withdrawal and history dependence 
   * Green-Lin solution to Diamond-Dybvig bank run problem 
      * Townsend Advanced Macroeconomics II lecture notes 
   * Multi-lateral smart contracts deal with financial stability concerns 
   * Yet this alone is not an argument for CBDC per se 
* Related Idea: Suggested caps on CBDC with withdrawal 
   * Related to the runs problem in the sense of programmable money 
* US repo market: Direct use of a wholesale CBDC 
   * Broker-dealer contract with clients, then trade in inter-dealer market 
   * Problems of coordination (multiple equilibria) and overly-binding liquidity ratios, US 
   * Solved with multi-agent smart contract on treasury and central bank ledgers for reserves, hence CBDC
* Digital assets on distributed ledgers, a regulatory smart contract 
   * Tokens as claims on intermediary returns, backed by data access 
   * A good thing for the economy, expect more 
   * But with multiple high velocity debts there can be a coordination problem 
   * Information at some nodes of exchange is key to implementation 
   * Easy to implement on distributed partitioned ledgers, or interoperable ledgers, like hash timelock, with much private but some public info

&amp;#x200B;

**Money and Monetary Policy: The Natural Domain, and Gain, from CBDC**

* Competitive equilibrium can be Pareto optimal, but not with incomplete markets, under which we get valued fiat money, plus scope for optimal activist monetary policy 
* Given this fiat base, a hierarchy of other monies on top 
   * bank deposit, debit and credit cards 
   * Multiple means of payment per se not a problem 
* With CBDC, another option: Paper replaced by digital currency, may potentially enhance monetary policy, e.g., interest earned on the coin 
* By analogy to the above, fully fiat-backed stable coins, backed by CBDC 
   * Much like ideal commercial bank accounts 
   * With monitoring of the backing, narrow banks 
* Conclusion: Public and private money can co-exist, fiat alone leaves gaps with private sector layered on top can help fill, both can be valuable 
* Open up to DeFi environment, sandbox idea 
   * Coins attempting stable values via algorithmic, programmed money 
   * CBDC tokens exchanged for private coins, which are sold to investors who want claims on physical asset purchases 
   * Secondary market in such DeFi coin 
   * Smart contracts for pooling resources, maturity and risk transformation without requiring a trusted third party. Just a different kind of financial intermediation, in some aspects easier to monitor. 
   * Analogy to having an economy with multiple assets and varying prices, which is not a new problem for central banks 
* Corollary: The future has arrived 
   * Financial system will continue to evolve with desirable innovations, and so the role for CBDC and central bank will evolve, but think ahead and get ready now 
* Solution for central banks 
   * Map of the financial system with tracking, put in cryptography, MPC and FHE for privacy, automate parts of monetary policy with programmable money

&amp;#x200B;

**Example of Revised Monetary Policy**

* In the US, COVID crisis relief transfers (micro) and ad hoc special facilities (macro financial) 
   * Neither very successful 
   * How to get to supply chains: Relationship banking though SBA was a problem 
   * Balance sheet of Fed grows yet again, intermediary of last resort 
* Consider as an alternative: Liquidity injections in thin markets 
   * As in joint work, Chandrasekhar, Townsend and Xandri (2021)
   * A model of risk-sharing, with money and risky assets
   * Inject liquidity to named key players, taking into account their interconnectedness, a new notion of financial centrality 
   * Those that provide liquidity to others precisely when the market is thin, when there is more covariate risk 
   * Using data to identify these players o 
      * Executed in Thai villages successfully, shows up in implicit consumption premium o 
      * In the US, existing regulatory data is not enough (back to the point about needed data infrastructure)

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusions**

* Role of public sector in design of open platform infrastructure, including programmability, potentially through a version of CBDC 
* Private sector competing on top, which works robustly (including returns, externalities) 
* Public sector has a role in providing countervailing competition in the public interest – in coins and smart contract provision 
* Public sector has a role in overall blueprints for the design of financial system 
* Need public database infrastructure for tracking, regulation, and policy 
   * It too needs to be designed, there are surprises 
* Public sector should use new technologies in regulation 
   * Bank runs, coordination problem in wholesale markets, and for trade in digital assets as high velocity circulating private debt tokens 
* Private and public monies can be complements, but distinct roles should be clear conceptually 
   * Do not have to fix exchange rate across all media, not the job of central bank through CBDC 
* Strongest argument for CBDC is as fiat money, improved monetary policy in an innovative financial economy

personalfinance,Question surrounding a credit card consolidation balance transfer,"Hello -

Apologize if this has been asked, I struggle with the search function on mobile. 

I’m a 29 year old making about $110k a year with $26k of credit card debt. While I have for the most part addressed some episodes of depression and fixed my bad habits that got me into these issues in my early 20s, with the high interest rates I’m facing I feel as though I’m largely just treading water. I have a decent credit score, with only the high CC utilization rates holding me back from having a great score. 

My question is - what would be the best way to transfer the balance of these 2 credit cards onto one no (or low) interest account. Would it be to just open another credit card and transfer the balance and pay off in the 0% interest period? I’m hesitant to have a hard inquiry on my score, so if there’s any that would specifically serve this purpose that would maybe only have a soft inquiry, it would be of great interest to me.",finance,1647887851.0

Now we have a bigger down payment saved, but our quoted interest rates have gone up from 3% to almost 5%. I know the Federal Reserve raised their interest rates by 0.25%, but why have lenders raised theirs by almost x4 that? It's completely priced us out of the market in our area.

Pros of holding USD:

1. Converting to INR cost me 0.5% of the amount which I save by not converting.

2. USD/INR rate seems to be going up for decades.

3. More stable currency.

Pros of holding INR:

1. Higher interest rate by bank/govt but there is also taxation on interest.

Let's assume the interest rate is consistent. Also, assume 0.5% is a fixed charge and will remain the same forever. Let's ignore geographical risk.

2. Income taxation on interests on deposit (straight-forward too)

investing,Raising interest rates to actually fight inflation,"This more a hypothetical question for those smarter than myself. Let’s start with my understanding of how raising interest rates impact inflation:

Right now, my money is sitting in my savings account doing nothing. Goods and services are getting more and more expensive everyday. Rather than letting inflation eat away at my money, I decide to spend as much as I reasonably can. For example, cars are getting more and more pricey. Might as well buy one now before they’re even more expensive next year. Now let’s say everyone in my area picks up that mindset. Everyone wants to buy a cat. Now the demand is much stronger than the supply, and prices of cars increase not only because of inflation, but because of demand. This is a sort of inflation spiral. 

Now let’s translate this to the business owner. My restaurant buys wine every week to sell to patrons with their meals. Every week wine goes up 3%. Any extra cash I have is not going into the bank, it’s going towards stocking up as much wine as I possibly can. All other restaurants do this and supply cannot match demand and we have runaway inflation. 

How can the Fed fight this? Make it so that your money sitting in savings isn’t getting destroyed by inflation. How would they do that? Raise interest rates. Here’s my question… how is raising interest rates 0.25% going to do ANYTHING AT ALL?!! Wouldn’t interest rates have to rise to the rate of inflation (or close enough)?? So anywhere from 7-15 percent depending on who you ask? I know things aren’t this simple but I’m just curious how anyone thinks small rate hikes will do anything. The house of cards is pretty easy to predict if/when rates explode. Most people believe we’re in a bubble now. If you had the choice between 7% savings rates and rolling the dice on the SP500 index which would you choose? I feel like we are going to have to drink our inflation medicine (big rate hikes) to avoid major economic collapse, which will be the catalyst for a large market adjustment in stocks/real estate.

CryptoCurrency,The whole “crypto is for smart people” or “your wallet security depends on your IQ/intelligence” crowd is actually a bad look for mass adoption.,"Ive seen a lot of sentiment basically saying if people make a mistake/get scammed/hacked they’re stupid and deserving of it or crypto is a place where the “smart” survive and the “dumb” suffer. This sort of attitude isn’t great for mass adoption when you think that more than half population isn’t exactly super smart or super dumb, they’re below average to above average with extremes on both ends. Most people will fall into these ranges and being elitist has never helped mass adoption, especially for something that already has a reputation amongst some for being a scam. 

Peoples crypto needs to be somewhat idiot proofed in terms of security for mass adoption because when you’re starting out, it’s definitely easy to send something to the wrong chain/address/forget to write something down/store things on a cloud/etc. This is why I feel like a certain layer or aspect of centralization will be vital for getting a large amount of people to take the leap to crypto.

The $12k is all on cards with fairly high interest rates, so I'm just cycling through paying interest.

Currently, I have roughly 6k in my ROTH, 5k in my bank, 8.5-9k that my relatives in Korea gave me (in Korean won which might depreciate more so I'll be switching that to USD ASAP), and 6.1k in cash. My company also gave me a relocation package which might give me around 2k once I'm done using it but I'm not completely sure yet.

So my father and I had a discussion yesterday on how we will tackle my debt. He said he will contribute around 500 dollars (or more depending on his income from his business) per month.   However, because my brother is also going to uni this year, I didn't want to burden my father with 2 student loans. So once I'm done moving and figure out how much money I need per month, I wanted to put aside 3 months' worth of living expenses for an emergency fund and use the rest of my savings to pay back my student loan. On the other hand, my father said to only use the money I earn and not to use a single cent in my saving since he'll also be contributing.

I currently have no use for the majority of the 20k except for funding my ROTH which I think will be fine even if I don't max it out for a year. I don't want to pay a large amount of interest when I don't have to and getting rid of my student loans early will most likely allow me to help pay for my parent's house once I move back to live with them, get my own house early on, and be able to fund my retirement funds like 401k and Roth more easily. I also want to go to grad school within the next 10 years so I'll be putting a bit of money in a 529 plan after paying back my student loans.

So my question is what is the better plan? Do I use my plan or my father's? Or do I do something in between? TIA

Edit: If the interest rate on my student loan is important, I think around 27.5k was parent plus which had around a 7% interest rate and 5.5k was Direct Unsubsidized loan which had a 4.53% interest rate from my research.",finance,1647894988.0

I'm thinking that we should be responsible for a percentage of the tax due that is equal to our percentage of combined income. Is this a fair and accurate thought?

Due to medical costs, taking in 3 young nephews after their father went to jail, and overspending, they went into debt. The only solution they could come up with to pay it off was to take out their first mortgage on their home through Rocket Mortgage (formerly Quicken Loans) I know. It’s awful. 

Now they owe 187k on their loan, which is at 3.4 % interest. However, it’s an adjustable rate mortgage, and in 5 months, their interest rate will start increasing. They’ve been told it will go up to 4.7% to start.

Forex,GBP/JPY could be in for an interesting week,"Both the UK and Japan are scheduled to release inflation data this week following last week’s central bank meetings. Although the BOE hiked interest rates by 25bps and the BOJ left rates unchanged, it was the UK’s central bank that appeared more dovish relative to what the market had been expecting. 

It was interesting to see both central banks express concerns over  the impact surging energy prices may have on household income. But given Japan’s status as a massive importer of oil and other commodities, the soaring cost of raw materials due to the Ukraine-Russia war is likely to have a larger adverse impact on the Japanese economy relative to the UK. This could support GBP/USD higher, and see the pair finally break resistance around 158.00 in the coming days. 

However, as mentioned earlier, both countries will also release CPI figures this week, and with the BOE already coming in more dovish than anticipated, a soft print could see the Pound sell-off, potentially putting GBP/USD on track for another re-test 155.50.

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14).

Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

personalfinance,Withholding over 50% in taxes on stock vests? How to change,"I got a stock vest recently for $16k. About [$8.1k of this](https://i.imgur.com/vQkQESM.png) was withheld as taxes. Looking at the distribution tax:

* 26.5% Federal
* 1.45% Medicare
* **6.2% FICA**
* 0.5% State disability
* **11.7% New York income tax**
* 4.25% Local income tax

I ran the numbers through an estimated tax calculator, with my annual incoming being \~$325k filing as individual w/ no dependents. Both the New York income tax and FICA witholdings should be about half of what it currently is. Federal seems correct and local is close enough for a margin of safety.

---

When I try adjusting this in my payroll, it only lets me sets '**Allowances**' and even when I set it to a high amount of allowances, it still takes out wayyyy too much in taxes on a state level, and can't seem to change FICA withholdings. 

How do I set the state/FICA withholdings to be less on supplemental income? I vest every month so at the current pace of withholdings, this would easily lead to a mid 5 figure tax refund.",finance,1647938018.0

personalfinance,Traditional or Roth 401k for someone on IBR for large student loan debt that is unlikely to be paid off completely?,"Hi reddit. I am finally getting my life together in my 40s after hitting rock bottom a few years ago (was homeless, was penniless, was depressed and a mess).

**Background**: When I was younger, I went to college on a full scholarship (no debt), but then I made an ill-advised decision to attend law school for a year and a half before quitting and then completing a master's degree in a different field that was just as unwise, expensive, and not a good fit for me. So I have about $90k in all-federal (thank god no private) student loan debt. I've been on an IBR repayment plan since incurring that debt and my payments for years were $0 or close to it. My life fell apart, I had a breakdown of sorts, and finally a few years ago I started picking up the pieces and getting to adult-ish functionality in my early 40s.

**Current Situation**: I have held down a stable, low-stress job for 3 years and make $42,000 in a relatively low cost of living area (my rent is $700). This may not seem like a big success, but once you've been homeless and suicidal and utterly broke, it feels good. I have an emergency fund of $8,000 and have paid off all debt except for the student loans, which are about 10 years into their repayment. Given my low income, I am on IBR and expect I probably will be until the remaining balance is forgiven (I know I may or may not be on the hook for a tax bomb on the forgiven amount in \~15 years' time, depending on government policy going forward).

**401k question**: My employer (a small company) recently added a 401k benefit this year. No matching, but we do have a choice between Traditional or Roth, and I don't know what to pick. I doubt my tax bracket will be measurably different now vs. in retirement. The consultant guy who presented the options made it seem like Roth is preferable, but my understanding is that by contributing a lot to a Traditional 401k, I can reduce my current AGI and thus lower my IBR student loan payment. With my present budget, I can afford to contribute about $4000-6000 a year to the 401k, depending on whether I can decrease my student loan payment or not and whether the 401k contributions are pretax (Trad) or not (Roth). I understand that paying less on my student loan now means that a (potential) tax bomb on a forgiven amount later would be higher, but paying less on that student loan now also means I could contribute more to my 401k. I'm at a loss for which is better -- or if it would even make a difference in my case. FYI, my loans are from before 2014, so I am in the ""15% of discretionary"" category of IBR.

I hope that all makes sense. I am leaning toward the Traditional so that I can lower my IBR payment and put away more money in the 401k. My assumption is that those increased contributions over time plus their gains (minus the eventual tax upon distribution) would be worth more than the increase in the tax bomb I might face come forgiveness time (and knowing/hoping that the tax bomb might even be permanently abolished by then). Do I have the right things on each side of the equation?",finance,1647947075.0
CryptoMarkets,"BIDEN TO SIGN BITCOIN, CRYPTO EXECUTIVE ORDER THIS WEEK","President Joe Biden will sign an executive order this week to task federal agencies with assessing the risks and opportunities that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bring to the U.S. and outline the government’s strategy for the market’s regulation, [reported](https://youtu.be/AKBOVAFoCp4).

The order will direct federal agencies to examine potential regulatory changes and the national security and economic impact of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, people familiar with the administration’s plans told *Bloomberg*. reported

“The executive order, which has been in the works since last year, will require federal agencies across the government to report later this year what they’re doing regarding digital tokens,” per the report. “The plan is expected to begin carving out roles for agencies across the government, from the State Department to the Commerce Department.”

Regulatory efforts [would also involve](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-administration-to-regulate-bitcoin-as-a-matter-of-national-security-report) the Treasury Department, National Economic Council, Council of Economic Advisers, and the White House National Security Council.

Bitcoin has risen to the spotlight since the U.S. and its allies began imposing restrictions on Russia in a push to isolate the country’s economy and suppress its abilities to continue marching forward in its Ukraine invasion. Despite being a [tangible alternative to Russian citizens](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-bitcoin-jumps-to-39k) who may now find themselves unable to send and receive money freely, Bitcoin is [likely unable](https://www.btcpolicy.org/blog/no-bitcoin-wont-save-russia-from-western-sanctions) to equally help the nation bypass Western sanctions altogether.

NFT,ETH NFT HOLDERS MUST READ THIS,"By depositing their ETH NFTs to Unicred, ETH NFT holders can now monetize or borrow crypto against them.

Since Unicred is a multichain platform (an NFT monetization protocol and a money market protocol), users can also obtain better interest rates and higher LTVs using data science. 

I commend how hard they work to be the best NFT-based lending platform in the crypto space. They recently formed a partnership with Fetch AI to use AI on their project. They also ensured that the smart contracts for users are safe and secure

The majority of the characteristics that Unicred embodies are those that the current loan crypto ecosystem lacks. As a result, this project will be our best option whenever we want to monetize or borrow against our NFTs.

personalfinance,First personal loan - 16.3 % interest rate and im paying less then I would have if I paid all my bills separately- Is this a good deal?,"******UPDATE******

I got the loan- paid of my credit cards, I froze all my cards including my debit card minus my lowest credit card $1500 - I am currently doing a minimal spend month only spending on luggage for a trip in May that’s been planned for a year (our free luggage that was like 20 years old. broke  last year at the air port so we need new check in ) , clothes (NO I’m not getting a new wardrobe I have 6 items I need that I don’t already have including specific shoes. ) and this was unexpected but I paid for new front breaks on my car last week. 

I am taking the next 6 weeks and doing 50 hours (this is doable for me) at work that will bring my weekly checks to $1k  after taxes where I’m saving everything other than bills (I try to be a month ahead but because of discounts on auto pay I have to split my payment to bi-monthly) and the above planed spending. 

I’m actually very happy with how this is going it’s only been a couple weeks but I like having spending and bills separated and I’m earning cash back on my card which was a big thing I know when my statement date is (27th) so I plan to have the card paid off before that date. I budget every week so I’m not double dipping with bill money and what I’m spending 

—— ORIGINAL POST ————
Hi, I’m new to finances I have a bad spending habit (i make enough but I spend too much) 
I applied for a loan with my bank to consolidate my credit card debt - $8700 

The loan they gave me was 16.3% with .25% taken off if I signed up for auto payments and I’d be paying $2,358 in interest if I paid minimum every month - I chose the 36 month because I was already trying to pay off one credit card in this time frame 

I was paying 232, 81, and min 37 ( $350 ) a month for my cards to pay them off in three years so right there I’m saving and I believe my interest for the higher card was 8k on its own 

I don’t see an issue with this loan, again I’m new to finances and I have a 670ish credit score one missed payment that was technically not my fault but it’s my account (I’m reaching out to lender to remove )

exchange,"Pulling last Exchange server, disable AD Sync. I know... I know...","Hi everyone, I’m cross-posting this to the r/office365 sub too, so apologies to those that are seeing this twice.

I’m being asked to pull the last 2016 Exchange server from a customer environment (which I’ve not done before) because they no longer want to be in a Hybrid scenario and maintain Exchange and AADC anymore. After reviewing what MS documentation I could find on the process, here is the plan I have come up with… I just need to know if there are any gotchya’s that I am missing.

Assumption: they are not using ADFS for 365 SSO but rather PHS through AADC  
Assumption: they are aware they will need to manage AD/AAD passwords separately after the change  
Assumption: they are aware they will need to manage user accounts/attributes in two places, and mail attributes in cloud only  
Assumption: they are aware they will need to find a solution to apps/printers that may relay through Exchange

The plan I am considering is the following:

\- Ensure they are no domains federated with an onprem ADFS  
\- Verify no onprem Public Folders / mailboxes / DLs  
\- Ensure all DNS records for MX and Autodiscover point to 365  
\- Decide what to do with their printers/apps; do they support SMTP AUTH? If not, maybe Direct Send.  
\- Remove exchange SCP serviceBindingInformation value(s) from AD via ADSIEDIT  
\- Disable connectors in 365 mailflow that point to onprem; remove org sharing from 365  
\- Disable AADC sync (MS says possible 72 hours for objects to flip to ‘cloud’)  
\- Uninstall Exchange

stocks,Why stocks rise when 10Y treasure hit almost 2.4%,"The previous weeks, every time the 10Y treasury was making a new high it was major news.

Example from 18th January CNBC

19th January

""The 10 year U.S. Treasury yield 1.9% on Wednesday its highest point since December 2019"" 

And obviously stock prices were falling those days. The explanation given by the analysts was that since the risk free return increased, investors avoid speculative companies and seek save heavens at bonds etc etc.

Today the treasury hit 2.37% and to my great surprise, there was no article mentioning this huge spike.

And markets keep going up. All unprofitable companies suddenly fly to moon. GME 10% up, Wish 7% up PTON 6% up etc etc

So how about the investors who seek safe assets in a rising interest environment, unprofitable companies that will find it difficult to find  new funding now that bonds are high and all other excuses used to justify why stock prices were free falling when 10Y yield increased from 1.79 to 1.81 back in January?

I’ve invested ~50k in a business over the past year. A good portion of this was done via credit cards with 0% intro.  ****I know this was a terrible decision**** but I was pretty confident I would be able to churn them and pay them off with the return from my investment, paying minimal interest before it’s paid off.

Unfortunately when the balances went up on a few cards, 3 of my cards closed (I didn’t know this was a thing).  Long story short, my credit score tanked (&lt;600 now. Was ~740) and churning is no longer an option. I have no derogatory marks on my credit history (ever). No late/missed payments, no bankruptcy or foreclosure.

My intro interest rates have expired now and it’s costing me (a risk I was aware of but hadn’t realized all of the ways it could happen).  ****My returns are able to cover payments/interest, other expenses (related to business) and still pay towards the balances**** but the rate at which I’m able to pay the balances down has dropped significantly. I’d like to lower the interest I’m paying to increase the amount I can pay towards the balances.

I could liquidate my investment/business assets and pay off the balances but obviously that would eliminate all of my opportunity for return.  I’m looking for a way to consolidate or roll my credit cards into something else with much better interest rates. So far I’ve come up with home equity loan or cash out mortgage refi. I have more than enough equity for these but didn’t want to refi and lose my interest rate I got in 2021.  I don’t think I’ll qualify for a straight up equity loan with my score where it is though. 

Does anyone know of any other options to consolidate high interest CCs into a worthwhile lower interest rate with a score below 600?  Typical consolidation options I’ve looked at with my score are effectively the same interest rate as the CCs.

**tl;dr Bitcoin is dangerous, and maybe not for the reasons you think it is.**

I created a project to address monopoly power in Telecom and, as a result, have spent the last year   examining digital systems and the nature of centralization.  I am writing a series of articles about my research and some of it may be relevant to this community.

This post challenges the accepted narrative that Bitcoin is decentralized.   Although many of you may disagree with my views, I am hoping that it may  serve to foster a discussion about cryptocurrency systems and how they  are governed and controlled.  I think it frames Bitcoin in a different  context than  you’re used to, and hopefully will be of some small use to  those who  wish to better understand its nature.

What follows is a preview relating to an upcoming, but unpublished, analysis of Bitcoin.

* Control and function are properties of systems.
* The functionality of Bitcoin is decentralized.
* The control of Bitcoin is completely centralized.
* The structure of Bitcoin is undemocratic.
* Bitcoin can only ever represent the interests of those who wish to increase the value of bitcoin.
* Bitcoin’s centralized control structure has been in place since its creation.
* Bitcoin   is more dangerous than a ponzi scheme.  It is an attempt to substitute   the limited decentralized control structures we have in place, in the form of democratic mechanisms, with a highly centralized control   structure representing anonymous special interests.
* Government officials who are invested in, or associated with, cryptocurrency projects represent a very serious danger to democratic institutions. Alignment of self-interest with crypto directly competes with the common interest of all stakeholders in society.  Destabilization or 	  destruction of existing economic, political, or cultural structures is in the best interest of those aligned with increasing the value of Bitcoin.
* Digital governance which decentralizes control can enable digital ecosystems that represent the common interest.

# Consent, Not Kings

As   our society becomes increasingly dependent on digital spaces, it is   vital that the ecosystems we build reflect our shared values and   represent the common interest.  Despite differences of opinion, history,   and circumstance, most people value fairness and freedom.  Our   interpretation of these values can conflict, but it finds common   purchase in democratic thought.  The institutions we raise may fall   short of our ideals, as they are susceptible to private interest and   corruption, but we persist in their construction as we hold a truth to   be self-evident.  We hold that it is from the consent of the governed   that those in control obtain their legitimacy and authority, and not   from the divine right of kings to rule.

The   democratic processes and mechanisms which we create afford us choice,   however limited, and the ability to establish a common interest.  These   structures represent an attempt to decentralize the control of our   societies.  Serious issues exist in our systems of democratic   governance, but it is important to point out that many of the flaws we   see are a result of inadequate decentralized control structures.    Democracy decentralizes, and a tyranny, real or digital, thrives in an   environment where control is centralized.  What then of Bitcoin and its   control structure?

# Functionality vs. Control

Systems   may be distributed, decentralized, or centralized, but they all share   the same two fundamental and interrelated, but separate properties:   Functionality and Control.  Humans have a bias towards centralization in   organizational systems and while the distinction between control and   function is obvious in some situations, cryptocurrencies exist in a   cognitive blind spot.

My work in   the factory may be decentralized to my team, or distributed to each   individual team member, but control of the work is orchestrated by our   manager, who in turns takes their direction from the owner.    Functionality is distributed and decentralized, but control is   centralized in a single person.  This is obvious to almost everyone, yet   in discussions about decentralized digital systems this distinction is   almost never addressed.  “Who controls Bitcoin?”, asks the clueless   reporter.  “No one.  It’s... decentralized.” replies the social media   billionaire as he adjusts his sunglasses and talks euphemistically of   tax evasion.  But this answer is misleading, if not an outright lie, as   evidenced by our Bitcoin dependency graph.  Bitcoin is controlled by  the  Miners and majority coin holders whose only concern is increasing  the  value of bitcoin.  This is the goal that must be pursued at any  cost,  and why Bitcoin uses decentralized functionality as a smokescreen  to  obscure centralized control.

# I Drink Your Milkshake

The   Bitcoin Protocol is governed by its source code, it determines the   decentralized functionality of the network.  The source code was   originally written by Satoshi Nakamoto and is now maintained by a group   of independent third parties who have no financial interest in an ever   increasing price for bitcoin… just kidding.  [In reality, the source maintainers are associated with organizations like Chaincode Labs, OkCoin, BitMEX, Blockstream, ](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1774750.0)[MIT D](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1774750.0)[CI, etc.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1774750.0)The MIT Digital Currency Initiative lends an air of legitimacy to the   guardians of the source, until further investigation reveals that it  is  an organization funded by Chaincode, BitMEX, Jack Dorsey, Coinshares   (Europe’s largest digital asset management company), and others.  The   interests of these companies and their owners are aligned in that they   seek to drive the price of Bitcoin to new all-time highs.

“So what?  They aren’t in control of the ecosystem!  Anyone can make a change to Bitcoin!  It’s Open Source!”  [As the blocksize debate demonstrated](https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7), [the only changes Bitcoin ](https://blog.plan99.net/the-philosophical-origins-of-bitcoins-civil-war-400468335377)[adopts are ](https://blog.plan99.net/the-philosophical-origins-of-bitcoins-civil-war-400468335377)[ones which can result in an increase to the value of bitcoin](https://blog.plan99.net/the-philosophical-origins-of-bitcoins-civil-war-400468335377).    Changes that represent the interests of users who wish to use Bitcoin   as a payment system are irrelevant and have been since the protocol  was  designed.  Moreover, there is a powerful group which can exercise  veto  power over any proposed change to the protocol.

You   might have noticed where the majority of the arrows point to on our   dependency graph.  Bitcoin’s Miners are the ultimate gatekeepers for the   system.  They control the network, both in terms of functionality and   in terms of governance.  Only changes that are voluntarily accepted by   the miners can “achieve consensus”, and as humans are self-interested   and miners do not operate nodes out of the kindness of their hearts, the   only changes that are acceptable are ones that either maintain or   potentially increase the value of the bitcoins they mine.

Miners are the ultimate authority in Bitcoin and, [regardless of how decentralized mining is in terms of functionality](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3942181),   Miners will always act as a cohesive group as their self-interest is   aligned towards the pursuit of value.  This dominant interest in the   system produces an asymmetry of utility between those who seek to   increase the value of bitcoin and users who wish to use the network for   payments.  This asymmetry of utility makes it almost impossible for   other interests to be represented in the network. In the case of   Bitcoin, it cannot be used as an effective payment system as the   interests of those seeking to derive other utility from the network are   not a consideration.

If a person   created a game, dictated the rules, acted as referee, and then competed   with other participants, would we call this fair?  Those who pursue   value in a system should not govern it, and set the rules for all   participants, as this leads to abuses of power.

# Dear Leader

Just   as it is in politics, if you want to understand someone’s motivations   and the interests they represent, it’s best to ask who’s paying them.    Nakamoto, who created the block reward mechanism that incentivizes   Miners, serves as Bitcoin’s financier.  The system is designed to put   complete control of the network into the hands of the Miners.  Nakamoto   then ensured their loyalty by paying them an asset that is guaranteed  to  double in value every four years by way of the halving schedule.    Moreover, Nakamoto distributed rewards asymmetrically to the early   Miners, 50% of the coin supply was distributed in the first four years.    It is in this way that a system which always represents Nakamoto’s own   interests was created.  All good things flow from the beneficence of  the  Creator(s).

[Nakamoto even used an undisclosed multi-threaded mining algorithm that ensured](https://bitslog.com/2020/08/22/the-patoshi-mining-machine/)[ control of ](https://bitslog.com/2020/08/22/the-patoshi-mining-machine/)[Bitcoin's ](https://bitslog.com/2020/08/22/the-patoshi-mining-machine/)[network in the early days](https://bitslog.com/2020/08/22/the-patoshi-mining-machine/)[.](https://bitslog.com/2020/08/22/the-patoshi-mining-machine/)This is typically portrayed as a heroic attempt by a single person to   stabilize a nascent network.  Ignoring completely that stability of  the  network leading to increased adoption, token value, and mining  rewards  coincides nicely with Nakamoto’s own self-interest.  [Nakamoto would also frequently ignore and sidestep direct questions about the viability of a ](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.0)[system](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.0)[ that looked more like a speculative asset than a currency](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.0).  [When asked directly about transactional performance, Nakamoto would redirect](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532) and [from the beginning chose to focus on bandwidth when discussing performance concerns.](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014815.html)

We   are asked to believe that a skilled and technically brilliant computer   scientist, who was familiar with the transactional requirements of   payment networks, and intended to design Bitcoin as a payment system,   failed to remember the most fundamental metric used to measure the   performance of online transaction processing (OLTP) systems?   Nakamoto   was surely aware of the importance of transactional throughput,  measured  by transactions per second (TPS).  Bitcoin is capable of  around 10 TPS,  and in 2008, VISA alone was capable of 10,000  transactions per second.   Bitcoin, in 2022, is off by three orders of  magnitude when compared to a  single 14-year-old payment network.  I  would ask the reader what their  first consideration would be if they  intended to create a global payment  system.  Would it be transactional  performance or an ironclad system of  asset ownership?

Even  if we take  the double spend problem into account, you cannot have a  functional  payment network without sane transactional throughput.  Of  course, when  it comes to hard questions Nakamoto is famous for his  Satoshi Sidestep.   Anyone who has extensively read Nakamoto’s writing  and correspondence  gets a sense the author’s intelligence and  thoughtfulness.  But after  stumbling across their claim that “[I'm better with code than with words though.](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014853.html)”, we are left to wonder if this is an example of humble self-depreciation or calculated misdirection.

Intention   is hard to prove, more so when the subject we are examining took   extraordinary measures to remain anonymous and carefully controlled   their online persona.  The fact that they paid cash for a domain   registration would seem to indicate they may have understood the   implications of what they were doing.  Perhaps their identity would have   had us question their intentions too closely.  Nevertheless, let us   assume the best of Nakamoto and constrain our inquiry to their actions.

# Words Are Wind

When   we consider Nakamoto’s actions by examining Bitcoin’s design, what we   observe is a system predicated on ownership of an artificially scarce   resource, known as bitcoin, of which the Creator(s) controls a   non-trivial percentage.  The system has its own monetary policy and   deflationary money supply, with around 90% of the planned 21,000,000   tokens currently in circulation.  The asymmetrical distribution of this   artificially scarce resource creates a feudal structure more  reminiscent  of medieval England than modern networks.  It is a  structure that  guarantees a vast disparity of wealth within its own  network and any  other system that is linked to it.  From the beginning  up to and until  the present day, the performance profile of the network  itself seems to  be tailored more towards transfers of real-estate than  to  micro-payments.  Control of the network and protocol is entirely in  the  hands of the Miners, individuals who are being paid by Bitcoin’s   Creator(s).  The self-interest of the Creator(s), Miners, and early   adopters is aligned towards the pursuit of value, ensuring that all   members will push in the same direction, towards an ever-inflating price   for bitcoin.  The interests of those who wish to use Bitcoin for its   stated purpose as a payment system do not have representation based on   the default design of the system’s control structure.

By   considering Bitcoin’s fully centralized control structure, we can   better understand its true nature.  The goal of Bitcoin is not to enable   micro-payments for the huddled and unbanked masses of impoverished El   Salvadorian farmers, nor is it to serve as a settlement layer, and   although closer to the truth, its purpose is not to serve as a store of   value.  Bitcoin is, and will be, whatever it has to be to replace   capital as a proxy for wealth in society, [thereby ](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html)[inflat](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html)[ing](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html)[ its ](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html)[own ](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html)[value ](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html)[to the point where 1 bitcoin is worth a 21 millionth of the global economy](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html).    It is intended to be a proxy for all resources in the real economy,   and as such, the ultimate goal is to tie everything to Bitcoin by   whatever means necessary.

This is   not a secret; the proponents of Bitcoin openly wish for its ascendance   over all forms of fiat currency.  It is an irony that bitcoin itself is  a  form of fiat, issued and controlled by anonymous and unaccountable   parties who control and own a system that represents only their   interests.  Bitcoin’s decentralized functionality is used as an anchor   for legitimacy and a justification for this desired supremacy, ignoring   the fact that the control of Bitcoin is more centralized than the   existing central banking system it purports to replace.

# Control

Central   banks in democratic societies, for all their deep structural flaws,   must represent the interests of all, even if it is to a minimal extent.    The control structures which operate central banks, known as   governments, have an interest in ensuring that the societies they govern   are productive and stable.  The mechanism of quantitative easing, or   printing money, is not just a financial measure to stimulate the   economy, it is better understood if its role as a tool of political   power is considered.  Governments can exert pressure on private special   interests and force them to be more productive.  If a private special   interest controls 5% of the resources in an economy, then doubling the   money supply will reduce their percentage of resource ownership by half.    To maintain their 5% stake, private interest must do work to maintain   their position.  Doing work, however, is hard, and it is better to own   5% of an artificially scarce resource and never have to do any work,  or  provide any utility, while being able to maintain your position of   wealth and power.

It is for the   same reason that in the present economic system we observe collusion   between central banks and powerful corporate special interests, [so that when the money supply is expanded, the majority of capital (our existing proxy for resource ](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/14/green-new-deal-banking-business-economic-recession)[ownership](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/14/green-new-deal-banking-business-economic-recession)[) is diverted to stock buy backs and corporate mergers](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/14/green-new-deal-banking-business-economic-recession).    This practice impoverishes the public by reducing the total  percentage  of resources they control in the economy.  It is an abuse of  power and a  deeply corrupt practice.  This misuse occurs because the **CONTROL** of our financial system is not sufficiently decentralized.

Decentralizing   the financial system’s functionality and replacing existing control   structures with even more centralized and unaccountable ones will make   the issue of corruption worse.  We will gift ourselves a financial   system where every remnant of transparency will be extirpated, private   interest will rule, and even the faintest memory of a common interest   will disappear.

Monetary expansion   is the control mechanism that Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies,  wish  to absolve themselves of.  Without this check on the power of  special  interests, they can be less efficient, less competitive, and  produce  less utility for society.  Therefore, cryptocurrencies value  ownership  over the production of real utility, as the removal of the  ability to  expand the money supply, coupled with an asymmetric  distribution of an  artificially scarce resource that determines  resource ownership, creates  a feudal power structure that protects the  wealth of special interests.   The ultimate goal is not to produce  useful products or systems,  decentralized functionality is inefficient  for this purpose, it is to  guarantee that the wealth built atop these  systems is unassailable and  cannot be redistributed.

Taxation   can be difficult, special interests can hide their wealth or lie   regarding the resources they have at their disposal, this is to say   nothing of tax loopholes which are secured by way of legalized bribery   of public officials.  Monetary expansion, when used judiciously and not   as a means of enriching special interests at the expense of the   populous, can serve as a powerful mechanism to decentralize control of   our economic system, as it can force concessions from special interests   without requiring their consent to taxation.  It is a form of coercion   which can be justified if it is used in the common interest.

Other mechanisms can fulfill a similar function, for example, a [demurrage fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency))   on large pools of idle capital could help to increase the velocity of   money inside our economy and stimulate the productivity of special   interests.  Moreover, tying the minimum cost of labour to the amount of   capital circulating in the economy could help to ensure that   quantitative easing does not disproportionately benefit special   interests.  A discussion concerning the various potential mechanisms   used to decentralize economic control lie outside the scope of this   post, I simply wish to point out that these mechanisms are important,   and they are the ones that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency projects   seek to prevent or eliminate.

# Bitcoin vs. Corporations

Our   corporate system has similar centralized control structures to   Bitcoin’s, but they differ in very significant ways.  Corporations align   the self-interest of a group of individuals to the pursuit of value   just as Bitcoin does.  Unlike Bitcoin however, they are required to be   productive and are constrained by the legal framework in which they   reside.  Citizens, or customers, can align their self-interest to that   of a profit seeking special interest only in specific ways that are   governed by the legal framework present in society.  The act of becoming   an employee, or a shareholder of a company are specific processes  which  entail legal protections and regulations.  Corporations represent   private special interests and although their control is highly   centralized, some control is decentralized in that elected officials,   who are accountable to the public, create rules which govern their   operation.  The inherent conflicts of interest caused by lobbying and   corporate malfeasance are well known, but overall, the legal constructs   known as corporations are legitimized through the consent of the   governed.  Bitcoin by contrast has no such frameworks to police its   excesses and the private special interests represented by Bitcoin are   unaccountable and anonymous.  The Kings who rest atop a feudal pyramid   control the system.

A more subtle difference between corporations and Bitcoin is the way in which Bitcoin can align the self-interest of users.

Outside   of specific legally defined relationships, an individual’s   self-interest is not aligned with corporate special interests.  The   self-interest of the corporation is aligned towards the pursuit of   value, but my own self-interest is aligned to whatever utility I am   seeking by consuming their product or service.  I buy apples because I   am hungry, or intend to make a pie, and not because I am interested in   turning a profit.  If my interests turn to selling apples or pies for a   profit, then my desired utility is once again different to those who   purchase my goods.  In economic exchanges between buyers and sellers,   self-interest is unaligned as each party desires different utility.   If   our self-interest is aligned, then we are either colluding or   competing.  It is worth noting that the act of buying the pies I   produce, adding nothing of value, and then attempting to sell them for a   higher price would be referred to as speculation.

In   a typical economic exchange, I am seeking the utility of a good or   service in exchange for the utility of value, but with Bitcoin I donate   value, and receive nothing in return in terms of real utility.  Instead  I  am given a promise that the value of bitcoin will increase.  If it   wasn’t for the complete absence of legal oversight and economic utility,   I would argue this is equivalent to an investment in real estate or   stock.  Bitcoin is unique, in that its structure allows for the   unconstrained alignment of self-interest with the special interests who   control the system.  Bitcoin consumes capital in the real economy and   replaces it with a desire to increase the price of bitcoin.  Even   compared to our modern-day corporate structures, Bitcoin is without   equal in its ability to advance self-interest, it is the purest form   developed in the history of our species.

# Worship in the Pyramid

Observers   frequently describe Bitcoin’s structure as pyramid, but Bitcoin  differs  from a ponzi scheme in that it combines economic interests with  a  religious belief that decentralized functionality is equivalent to   decentralized control.  This perpetual motion machine of self-interest   is far more reminiscent of a Nation’s ability to align the interests of   its citizens, and as we have seen with cults such as Scientology, this   combination of financial exploitation and belief can result in   structures that are extremely resistant to collapse.

The   utility of Value is a powerful driver of human action as it is a   logical construct which represents any possible desired utility.  [C](https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin)[ombined with decentralized zeal, clerics and con-men collude and go to extraordinary lengths to preserve ](https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin)[and extend ](https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin)[a system which benefits them](https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin).  This system of belief [is being widely evangelized and conversion of those in control of our political ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/15/democrats-divided-crypto-future-00015804)[or](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/15/democrats-divided-crypto-future-00015804)[ economic systems is especially prized](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/15/democrats-divided-crypto-future-00015804).    Once the self-interest of those in positions of power is aligned with   the interests of Bitcoin, there exists a grave risk for conflicts of   interest, as instability in our existing social systems is used to   propagandize Bitcoin as a cure-all for civilization’s woes.

Will   those whose interest lay in a competing system be tempted to sabotage   the ones they govern?  History and human nature would indicate that  this  is likely.  Democratic governance is fundamentally incompatible  with  existing cryptocurrency systems as they can only represent the  interests  of those in control of the system.  Despite the real dangers  to  democratic systems of governance, Bitcoin is increasingly an  effective  competitor to the State for societal power.  The alignment of   self-interest to a religion over the common interest of all citizens  is a  well-known threat to democracy, one wonders what financial  interests  prevent public officials from enforcing the separation of  Church and  State.

# Therein Lies the Rub

Bitcoin performs a bait and switch.  **If legitimacy is gained through consent of the governed, then Bitcoin   claims that no consent is needed because its decentralized functionality   means there is no central authority.**  The truth however, is   that decentralized functionality conceals centralized control by a group   of individuals who have a singular purpose.  Worse still, unlike   existing systems of control in our society, Bitcoin has no public   accountability, representation, or rule of law.  Advocates may insist   that the rules which determine the functioning of the protocol are open.    But if the only laws that can be made are for the benefit of the   Masters, then Bitcoin is a tyranny, and those who promulgate its spread   wish us to be slaves.

No crime or   externality is too great; as long as the sacrifice is made at  Bitcoin’s  alter, then bribery, ecological harm, or disinformation are  all  justifiable means to an end.  When power is used to advance private   interest at the expense of the public interest we say that it  corrupts.   A technological system devoted to the unrestrained  advancement of  private interest above all other considerations is then  the digital  personification of corruption.  Bitcoin is an ethical  regression which  claims the divine right of Miners, early adopters, and  the Creator(s) to  rule.

It is  not enough to observe  from the sidelines, mock Bitcoin or it’s  adherents, and think ourselves  better than those who have been  exploited.  Active resistance is needed  to prevent the dismantling of  existing decentralized control  structures.  The installation of systems  that favour centralized control  and zero accountability are a risk to  existing democratically governed  institutions.  Moreover, we must  challenge the religious belief that  because a system’s functionality is  decentralized, that it is not  centrally controlled.  A group of  individuals who act in concert and  whose self-interest is aligned are  no different than a group  representing a special interest.

While   some blockchain projects provide real utility, and may even be useful   in the future, they are all susceptible to the same centralization of   control as, to my knowledge, no existing project has put in place a   comprehensive system of decentralized control.  Nor is Proof-of-stake a   guarantee that control is decentralized as token ownership is   centralized among early adopters and, at best, acts as a proxy for the   existing unequal distribution of wealth in the capital based economy.    If the control of an ecosystem is in the hands of individuals who wish   to inflate a token to the highest possible value, then that is the   interest that will be advanced, and no other interests will be   represented unless it supports the system’s prime directive, and serves   the self-interest of those in control.   To counter the natural pull of   self-interest, a different paradigm is needed.

# Building Better Systems

Distributed   functionality can be useful, but its implementation comes with serious   drawbacks in terms of performance and efficiency.  Moreover, if it is   coupled with centralized control, we obtain the worst of both worlds.    Centralized control inevitably leads to corruption, as a result, a   system’s stated goals will differ from its actual goals.  If we wish to   create digital systems that can remain true to their stated goals, and   represent the interests of all participants in the system, then we must   look at ways to decentralize control through technological and other   means.  The same methods which Bitcoin uses to enforce a feudal   ownership system, blockchain, can be repurposed to enable radical forms   of transparency that assist in the decentralization of control.  As a   system’s functionality becomes progressively more centralized, so too   does the requirement for stronger decentralized control mechanisms.  The   functionality we create matters, but the governance systems we use to   decentralize control matter more.

I   will be covering how these mechanisms can work and other topics  related  to the design and governance of digital systems.

personalfinance,Marriage benefits vs. domestic partnership,"I (32M) and my finacee (29F) are about to be married in CA. We are both very high earners (200k+) and we own a house together. Because of our financial situation, getting married gives us a marriage penalty of an additional \~10k in taxes per year. However, we recently found out that CA allows opposite-sex couples under 62 to become domestic partners now. Domestic partners get legal protections/responsibilities like marriage does for things like community property, having children (we would both be their legal parents automatically), etc. but we would still count as single for federal tax purposes (one of us can file as head of household once there are children) and thus saves us our entire marriage penalty (again, over 10k a year), even though we would have to file CA state taxes as married (the fed savings more than makes up for the CA marriage/DP penalty we get). We both have our own health insurance and all that from our jobs, but in any case both of our jobs allow us to add domestic partners to our respective health plans. If something changes about our financial situation in the future, we could always file the form with our county to convert us to fully married.

# KEY POINTS

* SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory
* Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside
* MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory &amp; semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy
* Consensus Price Target: $110 (&gt;50% Upside)

# Company Description

Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues.

# Thesis

SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations.

This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4!

I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis:

This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).

What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good.

More importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021’s $1B in sales probably wasn't ""peak"", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no.

In other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

Luckily, Needham modeled this for us (see link to OG post below for pic of their table). For now just know shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185.

Bottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.

Also, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&amp;P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares &lt;3

# Current Valuation &amp; Financials

Fwd P/E '22: 8.66x

Earnings Growth Est: +41% '22

* Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value.

Fwd P/S ’22: 2.11x

Revenue Growth Est: 24% '22

* These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 &amp; Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as ""baseline"", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded ""materially higher"" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth.
* This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, ""We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP \[in PCIe Gen 5\] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market… estimated TAM $4-5Bn"". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs.
* Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed.

EBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22

* You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product)

Free Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22

* Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept!
* Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21

Analyst Price Target: $110

* Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120.

# Technicals &amp; Market Mechanics

SIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry &amp; sector. (See Appendix for charts)

SIMO has a higher beta to the semis &amp; memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.

# Upcoming Catalysts

Once again, a long list of event catalysts around the corner.

SIMO

* 3/23 Bank of America APAC TMT Conference 2022 (SIMO; potential pre-guide and/or capacity updates)
* 5/5 SIMO ER
* Now - 4/5, 5/6 - SIMO has expressed desire to accelerate their buyback program. Outside of the 30day pre-earnings blackout period, buybacks should kick in big time

Industry

* 3/23 U.S. Senate hearing on semis supply chain ""Developing Next Gen Tech for Innovation"", featuring execs from MU (25% revs) &amp; INTC ($8.65% revs). Discussions will revolve around investment in Federal investment in semi mfg supply chains &amp; America COMPETES Act 2022 &amp; CHIPS for America Fund (potential $52bil to support US semi mfg fabs).

Key Supply Chain Ers (\~50% of Revs represented)

* 3/29 MU (25% Revs); this is THE biggest catalyst for SIMO, and thanks to current memory market dynamics, MU should have a total blowout
* 4/7 Samsung (3.3% Revs)
* 4/28 INTC (8.65% Revs)
* 4/28 Fujitsu (1.2% Revs)
* 4/28 SK Hynix (4.89% Revs)
* 4/29 WDC (4.23% Revs)
* 5/6 Arrow Electronics (2.2% Revs)

personalfinance,Sold a business -- estimated tax question (do I owe it?),"Hi everyone -- could use some general guidance here. I've been talking to accountants and am hearing a couple different things. The situation:

* I owned 25% of a business that sold mid-March, and took home pre-tax cash of \~$8MM as a distribution (technically -- the business F-reorg'd and the proceeds were paid to a holding S-corp that then distributed them out pro-rata to me and the other shareholders, all mid-March)
* Last year's taxes are very simple -- the business paid me \~$125k in W2 income, and I have a handful of stock investments that might have some long-term cap gains. I did not take any distributions and have no other income to report for the year. 

Questions:

* Do I owe any estimated taxes (esp by Apr 15)?

   * A couple accountants mentioned I'd definitely owe some estimated taxes on a quarterly basis, and a couple mentioned that as long as I pay all of the previous year's taxes in full (or up to 110%) on time, I can wait on paying the cap gains taxes from the sale until next year's tax season
* How do I estimate those taxes, if I do owe them? I'm thinking it's just gain - basis \* tax rate (for Fed and state, \~35% combined). Is that right?

### Scaling.
Bottle neck but lots coming:
- Isomorphic state channels w/ code execution (Hydra)
- BFT side chains, security guarantees of L1
- zk rollups (Orbis)
- Improvements in block propagation, DAG mechanisms

Most in near term. June hard fork will scale us massively.

### Cardano is real world focused
- Decentralised Digital ID for KYC inclined
- Self-funding, also real-world projects
- Telecom (Dish, World Mobile)
- Micropayments (Hydra)
- Governance solutions (Ethiopia)
- Dapp store, for your dad
- Drag&amp;drop SC

### Baked in governance 
Others inevitably hit a centralisation wall. Cardano has governance baked in, is sustainable

A self-funded, -governed decentralised open source system to manage identity, value, governance

Think about the scope. Bigger than TPS obsessed L1s (though we’ll compete on that soon)

### Total Value Locked
[TVL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl): you haven’t seen anything yet. 

- Stable coins are coming soon via various venues
- Ardana (3ac funded, central banker on the team) could be our Anchor. Liqwid will be our Compound. Aada will be our AAVE

You’re still super early, none of these have even launched yet!

### Monetary policy 
Lastly, Cardano’s monetary policy and $ADA hardness is second only to perhaps Bitcoin

Only thousands of people agreeing in governance could ever change it

Together with inclusive growth bc of self-funding it’s the antidote to the full on ponzinomics chains. Long term growth

personalfinance,Need advice on buying land -- HELOC or escrow payments via title company?,"Hello. My wife and I are trying to buy land; we are buying for investment/recreational purposes, not to build on (not immediately). For the sake of ease I'll include the real figures that pertain to this situation. 

We have $80k in cash to put into land. We can secure a HELOC loan for $52k; this HELOC loan is 15yr fixed at 4.5%. The land that we want to buy is $160k. This particular land has a seller willing to set up an escrow account at 8% and a 20 year fixed rate. They only require 20% down, FWIW. 

My questions are: 

* Is there anything to look out for with a seller-granted escrow payment? What are common terms with this setup, for instance what if we wanted to sell before the final payment was made, or if we wanted to sub-divide the property? 
* Is there a sweet spot that we can borrow a partial HELOC and set up an escrow plan? For example, borrow $20k with the HELOC, and then set up the escrow plan for the remaining $60k?   
The HELOC has a lower interest rate so it stands to reason that borrowing with a lower rate would be more beneficial, but the escrow plan is for 20 years which also lowers the payment.
* What are some good web tools available for calculating the above? 

I can answer any additional questions that would help us to educate ourselves in this situation. Thank you for any and all advice!",finance,1647991949.0
personalfinance,I think i found an issue with cashApp taxes and they don't care,"There are two values for mortgage  interest deduction, one for federal and one for state. However the tax  software only accepts one value and uses that value on both federal and state  returns.

Federal mortgage interest deduction is capped at $750000

whereas the state mortgage interest deduction is at $1000000 (for california)

So  if your mortgage is more than $750000 the deduction will be different for state  and federal.

personalfinance,"First time auto finance and got completely screwed over, I need advise!","Hello all!

I purchased a new car yesterday and when I was shown the cost the total was 28,000$, however, after being completely blind-sighted and manipulated, I just checked that my total sales price is $39,522???

I traded in my shitty car for 2,500 and put down 3,000 cash. It says my total payments are 34,022 after that (4,000 is from my 3.45 interest rate). What bothers me is that I wasn't informed that GAP insurance and whatever else I'm paying for was optional, the man just presented two options and told me to pick one. Also I assumed that the money I put towards the car would reduce from the 28,000 not increase to 39,000! I know I'm stupid and should have been asking more questions but after spending hours and interacting with multiple people, I was exhausted by the time it came to paperwork. I've always bought used cars in cash so this was way out of my element,

My question is, is there anything I can do to fight the cost? I had 800 credit so I was considering going to a credit union to see some options. The reason I didn't use the credit union in the first place is because the finance person told me that if I used a third party the cost of the car would increase. Can anyone give me any advice? Can I call the dealer and ask why I'm paying 10,000 more?? I feel so stupid and awful and I would just like some insight to help me!",finance,1647999422.0

personalfinance,Purchasing New Build - Interest Rates,"My wife and I chose to build a new home in December of 2021 and signed a purchase agreement to get started. We put down 10% up front as requested of the $682,000 home sales price. At the time we shopped around, interest rates were 2.8-3%, and now they’re averaging around 4.6-4.8%. The builder has yet to start on the build site, so we’re skeptical of locking, and most lenders allowing a long term lock are around 4.8% at the moment. I have called dozens of banks and credit unions, and currently there are credit unions with lock periods of 60 days at around 3.25-3.5% for 5 or 7 year ARMs. Would it be wise of us to rate lock around a 4.8% for a long term lock ASAP, or wait a few months and see if we can get some serious progress on the home and then lock in a lower ARM? We’re trying not to get hosed any more than we already have, as our payments have gone from an estimated $3,400/m to $4,000/m in a matter of 3 months and there wasn’t much we could do other than blindly lock a rate back when we signed the purchase agreement for the longest rate lock term and then pay to extend if it came to that.

economy,Alphabet: What You Should Know About The 20-For-1 Stock Split,"Alphabet also announced a 20-for-1 stock split coming July.

The decision comes after the stock has soared more than 65% in the past year, driving its per-share price above the $3,000-level at its peak.

The upcoming stock split intends to make the Alphabet stock more affordable and accessible to individual investors going forward.

Taking recent stock splits observed across its megacap peers like Apple and Tesla as a proxy, the Alphabet stock's valuation prospects are expected to further improve following its July stock split.

Paired with the combination of robust cash flows generated from operations and continued strength across its core business groups, the Alphabet stock makes one of the most resilient, safe and profitable investment picks under the current macro environment.

￼

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News

2021 was a record year for the Alphabet stock (Nasdaq: NASDAQ:GOOG / NASDAQ:GOOGL). Having delivered generous returns of more than 65% last year, GOOG was the largest gainer amongst its FAANG peers. But the stock's value has since declined alongside a broad market selloff triggered by concerns over rising inflation risks and an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve. Prospects of diminishing pandemic-era stimulus and a faster-than-expected rate hike beginning March has whipsawed the markets, wiping out more than $7 trillion in market value in the past month alone with high-valuation growth stocks being the most severely impacted. While GOOG's underlying business boasts one of the most robust checkbooks that could weather any storm, the stock was unable to escape from the broader market rout that had pushed key benchmark indexes like the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 into correction territory last month.

Yet, Tuesday's upbeat earnings call on fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results was seemingly enough to assuage growing investors' angst over the stock's prospects within the dire macro backdrop. Following declines of as much as 11% throughout the bulk of January, the stock unleashed a steep uptrend in late-trading Tuesday. GOOG surpassed the $3,000-level in late trading, the first time since the November rally, after reporting sales and profits that beat consensus estimates.",finance,1648019546.0

Prices rose across the UK economy at the fastest rate in 30 years in the year to February, intensifying a cost-of-living crisis in the country.

Year-on-year consumer price index inflation hit 6.2% in February, the Office for National Statistics [said](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/february2022) Wednesday, the highest level since 1992. The reading was up from 5.5% in January, and above economists' expectations of 6%.

""Inflation rose steeply in February as prices increased for a wide range of goods and services, for products as diverse as food to toys and games,"" Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said.

The jump in inflation adds to the chances that the Bank of England will hike interest rates again at its next meeting on May 5. It has already raised them for [three meetings in a row](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/bank-of-england-interest-rates-uk-economy-inflation-ukraine-conflict-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets), taking the main rate from a record low of 0.1% to 0.75%.

London's [FTSE 100](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/ftse_100?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) stock index was up 0.52% after the figures were released. The [pound](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/gbp-usd?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) was down 0.23% to $1.323.

The figures make tough reading for Britons, who are now seeing prices rise faster than wages and face a steep rise in living costs in the spring.

Energy bills are set to soar in April after wholesale prices skyrocketed and the government lifted a price cap. Prices at the fuel pump have also risen sharply, and the Ukraine conflict risks sending energy prices even higher.

The government is also increasing taxes in April, as it worries about the state of the public finances following a surge in spending during the coronavirus crisis.

There is little sign that the cost-of-living crisis will abate any time soon. The Bank of England expects inflation to soar above 8%, and even suggested it could hit double digits if global energy prices continue to rise.

UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil measures to ease some of the burden on households when he delivers a spring economic statement later Wednesday. However, he has argued in favor of tax rises in the face of opposition from within his own party.

Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said he expects inflation to rise significantly over the coming months.

""The impact of rising global goods prices continued to feed through,"" he said. ""What happens further out will be heavily influenced by the geopolitical situation and its impact on commodity prices.""

Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expects the Bank of England to be cautious about how far it raises interest rates.

""With the economic recovery likely to slow sharply as households feel the pinch, and domestically-generated inflation still relatively subdued, we expect the Committee to pause raising Bank Rate, once it has increased it to 1% in May,"" he said.

""Further rate hikes would increase the risk of a [recession](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-recession?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) and the chances that CPI inflation ultimately would significantly undershoot the 2% target in the medium term.""",finance,1648032322.0
personalfinance,Best Strategy For Dealing WIth CC Debt at age 22.,"I am asking this here because I have no one else to ask. 

I am 22 and I live with on my own with my roommate. I have no financial (or moral) support from my family. I moved out and distanced myself from my family because of  my father being a lifelong alcholic and insufferable to live with. 

I moved out on my own and have never felt better. I've made friends with my roommate. I moved in last fall, and pay my roommate rent every month in-full and on-time. This is a huge step in my life and meant more to me than a college degree. LIving my own life and working towards my own goals without anyone holding me back. 

However, I have racked up a considerable amount of credit card debt (around 13k) repairing my vehicle because I had no other options.  With my tanking credit score, and the cost of insurance in MIchigan, there's no way I could afford a newer vehicle and insurance every month. I need a vehicle that gets me to the job that makes me money.

I have racked up debt buying groceries, gas, repairing said vehicle, and paying copays from the doctor's office. I had to pay movers as well when I moved because I had no one to help me move out of a 2nd story apartment building (I had to move out very swiftly). I have debt from moving expenses besides movers. I had to take an unpaid day off of work to move out, another loss of income. 

I'm not trying to defer responsilbility, but I want to make it clear I used my credit out of desperation rather than reckless spending habits.

I even quit my job for a better paying one and more hours.

Now I am at the point where I need to start rehabbing my credit or I will never be able to get my own place of any kind.

I checked my rate on sites like upstart, but the amount they offer me (based on my abhorrent credit score) is not enough to pay even 1 credit card off with a better interest rate. 

I have to get this debt under control now because it's the last thing holding me back in life. I am embarassed at the amount of debt  I have for someone so young, and I don't know anyone who has knowledge of being in this situation that can help me.

Please don't judge me and I will appreciate any insights you have.",finance,1648032513.0

personalfinance,Advice Needed on Tax Savings,"Hey everybody. I’ve been a freelancer (sole proprietor) for a while now, but have really been doing it full-time these past two years. I’m in California, which makes my current tax responsibility about 43.3% (SE+fed+state) of my income. It’s pretty outrageous in my personal opinion.

I’m projecting to make around $25,000 - $30,000 per quarter this year, which means I’m giving up almost $10,000 per quarter (after business deductions). I like saving and investing, but being self employed really does encourage you to spend and lose so much. I was wondering if anybody here can give me advice on how to reduce my tax responsibility? Is incorporating worth it for a freelancer? Are there investment/retirement plans that also help with tax savings? 

Thanks!",finance,1648036392.0
personalfinance,Trying to figure out options for consolidating about $50k in loans.,"My wife and I have acquired some debts the past couple years, with various personal loans ranging from 7-9% ... totaling ~$50-60k. Much of this money was needed quickly to tackle some home issues that we simply couldn't delay on. So we ""bit the bullet"" and applied for various loans to cover our immediate financial needs. 

At the time, we figured we'd be able to pay it off in a matter of months, so the interest rate didn't really matter. But now we're finding ourselves unable to pay it off as quickly as we had hoped. 

**We're trying to figure out if consolidating all these individual loans into one single loan with a lower interest rate is an option.** So far, the options we've found seem to be targeted toward those with much higher interest rates, which doesn't really apply to us.

But, generally speaking, we're not used to loans as high as 9%, so this feels like a larger hurdle than we necessarily feel comfortable with. It's causing my wife a lot of stress, and I feel the burden too. 

Is there any chance of getting a single loan to consolidate all this debt at a lower interest rate? Or is that not even really the right approach here?

I was wondering if I could get some feedback on a solar proposal that I received from an installer.

7.6kW System

* 21 REC N-Peak 2 Black Series 365W
* Enphase IQ/IQ+ mico inverters
* IronRidge mounting system
* Linear Power Warranty: 25 years
* Panel Product Warranty: 25 years
* Roof Penetration/Workmanship Warranty: lifetime
* Labor Warranty: 25 years

Total Cost Cash: $20,542, after federal tax credit $15,201

From the research I've done these panels seem like they are very good.  Their power degradation is much lower than other panels I've looked at.  These panels will still make 92% of their original power after 25 years.

I will still have room on my roof for 7 or 8 more panels.  So if/when I get an EV I could potentially add more panels to offset its power needs.

I also have the option of URECO FAM\_E7G-BB 365w panels.  They degrade to 82% after 25 years, but they system would only cost $19,699, after tax credit $14,577.  I'm leaning towards the REC.

investing,Russian Stock Market to Partially Reopen on Thursday,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-stock-market-prepares-for-an-unusual-reopening-11648023739

&gt; Russia’s stock market is set to have a partial reopening Thursday, nearly a month after it shut down following the invasion of Ukraine. 
The challenge for Moscow is that the resumption of trading could simply send Russian stocks back into free fall. On Feb. 24, the day when President Vladimir Putin began the assault on Ukraine, the main Russian stock index tumbled 33%. While the index regained a fraction of those losses on Feb. 25—its last day of trading—that was before Western sanctions hammered the ruble and sent the country into an economic crisis.

&gt;To limit the fallout, Moscow has turned to some heavy-handed policies. It blocked foreign investors from dumping local stocks—a move that some market participants saw as retaliation for a Western freeze on Russian central bank assets since a big chunk of the Russian market is owned by foreigners. The Russian government ordered its main sovereign-wealth fund to buy billions of dollars worth of shares. 

&gt;The Russian stock market could ultimately look very different than it did before, with a plan under discussion to split it into separate markets for foreign and local investors, according to a person familiar with the matter.

&gt;Russia’s central bank said Wednesday that it will allow trading of 33 shares out of 50 included in the benchmark stock index, the MOEX, on Thursday from 9:50 a.m. to 2 p.m. Moscow time. Among the companies to be traded are Gazprom PJSC and Lukoil PJSC. Bets on the fall of a stock, known as short-selling, will be banned.

&gt;Under a policy announced by the central bank on Feb. 28, Russian brokerages aren’t allowed to let foreign clients sell securities. This will prevent foreigners from bolting for the exits as soon as the market reopens, which could be ruinous because of their outsize role in Russian stocks. International institutional investors held about three-quarters of the Russian market’s free float as of February 2020, according to Sberbank Investment Research.

&gt;That has raised concerns that the market will be skewed by the absence of foreign investors, who accounted for nearly half of equities trading volume at the Moscow Exchange in the first half of last year.
“There will be an illusion of a working, recovering Russian stock market, even though a huge class of players in the market—foreigners—won’t have the opportunity to sell,” said Vladimir Kreyndel, CEO of ETF Consulting, a Moscow firm that advises issuers of exchange-traded funds. 

&gt;Among the Western investors that held Russian stocks before the freeze were asset-management giants Vanguard Group and Fidelity International. Both firms have said they are reducing exposure to Russia.
Due to the freeze, foreign investors won’t have much to do when the stock market reopens. 

&gt;But the plan under consideration by Russian officials—which is still in the discussion stages—would effectively split the country’s securities market in two, with one market for foreigners and another for local investors, the person familiar with the matter said. In this arrangement, foreign investors could sell their shares or bonds, but would face restrictions on moving the proceeds out of Russia because of capital controls that Moscow has imposed since February, the person said.

&gt;Such a bifurcated market could result in oddities, such as the same stock having two different prices. That isn’t completely unprecedented. In China, there have long been discrepancies between shares on mainland exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen and those listed in Hong Kong.
It could also prevent further erosion of the ruble’s value. Russia’s currency has stabilized in recent sessions to trade near 104 rubles to the dollar, though it remains 22% weaker than before Russia invaded Ukraine.

&gt;“The biggest fear is that the central bank is under sanctions and they don’t want foreign investors to sell their shares and take the ruble and buy hard currency,” said Jacob Grapengiesser, head of Eastern Europe at emerging markets fund manager East Capital.

&gt;The Moscow Exchange said Monday that it would allow for the settlement of trades that foreign investors had placed before Feb. 28 that were still being processed. Mr. Grapengiesser said his firm had trades still awaiting settlement from the start of the war that he expects to go through soon. 

&gt;“It’s a natural step before opening the market. You need to take care of those unsettled trades,” he said. “Things are slowly moving forward.”
Shortly after the war began, Russia’s prime minister ordered the country’s National Wealth Fund to buy up to one trillion rubles, equivalent to $9.38 billion, worth of shares this year. Analysts also expect some Russian oil companies to prop up their share prices with buyback programs.

&gt;Local investors may buy stocks too. When Russia invaded Crimea, the MOEX fell almost 18% between mid-February and mid-March of 2014. But by the end of that year, it had rebounded more than 12% from that March low. The broad index has posted gains in all but one year since 2014. Stocks in unstable countries can also serve as hedges against inflation because locals expect companies can offset rising costs by charging higher prices.

&gt;The government’s efforts have led some to be cautiously optimistic about the reopening. “Initially, I think there will be a moderate correction,” said Natalia Smirnova, a financial adviser in Moscow. “But I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the first day could end up with a modest increase.”

&gt;Russia is a minnow of a financial market by global terms. In December 2021, the total market capitalization of companies listed on the Moscow Exchange was about $842 billion, according to the World Federation of Exchanges, which is just under 90% of the current value of Tesla Inc. That made the Moscow Exchange the 20th largest bourse by market cap, just above Brazil’s B3 exchange, in the WFE’s ranking of global exchanges.

&gt;Until the war, Russia mostly attracted attention from specialist emerging-market funds and hedge funds, though it made up only a fraction of holdings for most globally minded investors. 

&gt;MSCI Inc. said it would drop Russian stocks from its influential indexes that track emerging markets. Before the war, MSCI’s emerging market index had a 2.8% weighting for Russia. FTSE Russell has also announced plans to remove Russian stocks from its indexes. The moves will force investors whose holdings track the indexes to sell—when they can. 
Wars have led to stock-market shutdowns before, although it is unusual. The New York Stock Exchange closed for about four months when World War I broke out in 1914, the longest closure in the NYSE’s history. The Beirut Stock Exchange reopened in 1996 after a nearly 13-year shutdown caused by Lebanon’s civil war.",finance,1648043543.0

economy,What does the Fed compare its 2% inflation goal to?,"In essence: How do I find the yearly inflation rate that the Fed compares its goal to?

Fed uses the core-PCE as an inflation measure; a number which it compares to its goal of an average inflation rate of 2%.

However, what is the ""counterpart"" to the 2%? Is it to calculate **annual historical inflation**, like (example):  
1/1/2019: Basket of goods costs 100$  
1/1/2020: Basket of goods costs 110$  
1/1/2021: Basket of goods costs 120$

(110 - 100)/100 \* 100 = 10%, inflation for 2020 was 10%.  
(120-110)/110 \* 100 = 9,09%, inflation for 2021 was 9,09%.

Or is it calculated as an **average monthly/annual inflation rate**, like (example):  
12/1/2019 basket of goods costs 100  
1/1/2020 basket of goods costs 102$  
2/1/2020 basket of goods costs 109$  
3/1/2020 basket of goods costs 112$  
.... 9 more times\*

(102 - 100)/100 \* 100 = 2%,  
(109 - 102)/102 \* 100 = 6,86%  
(112 - 109)/109 \* 100 = 2,75%  
... 9 more times\*

(2 + 6,86 + 2,75 + 9 more months\*)/3 = 3,87% average inflation rate

I'm mainly confused because I'm a native Dane, and at this site: [Personal Consumption Expenditures Excluding Food and Energy (Chain-Type Price Index) (PCEPILFE) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEPILFE) I get two wildly different results depending on whether I choose the **aggregation method** ""Average"" or ""End of period"".

personalfinance,UK Mortgage advice for a Self Employed First Time Buyer,"Hi! Sorry for long post - I'm very new to this, but also pretty ambitious with the idea so keen to know your thoughts. ***TLDR at bottom of post***

So I'm looking for advice on a few things. First off, my partner and I are always on Rightmove - every other evening it feels like we're doing a good check to see whats new. Every few months or so we see a house pop up that we absolutely adore - we've just seen the best one yet, so I think it's time we really start looking at this as a possibility as apposed to a dream. I guess your answers to my questions will determine if that switch in mindset is even sensible.

A bit of background on the house and our situations - the house is up for around £650k, its overpriced so I wouldn't be expecting to pay that much. I'd like to think financially we're able to comfortably afford a mortgage of £1,600 a month, with a buffer going up to £2,200 should interest rates increase. Thats based on our monthly budget, we currently pay £1,300 rent, partner has a car loan of around £110pm, I have a BBL of £200pm and have a campervan that was bought half with cash and half with a loan which comes out at £400pm month including insurance. Currently our main outgoings total around the £2,400 mark including Utilities. 

Before purchasing I'd like to think we'd be able to reduce that to around £1800 by paying off partners car loan, selling the van and doing some magic with out Utilites to get a cheaper price (currently being utterly ripped off, even taking into account the rise in energy prices).

Our income is an odd one, for me anyway, my partner is employed and on £23k per year. But I've totally screwed myself - you will all laugh as it's probably a very common mistake that you all hear time and time again on this sub. I've been a self employed designer/animator since I was 14, I'm now 24. For almost all of those years, I've done everything I can to write off as much as possible as an expense. 21/22 has been a great year with an almost £70k turnover, but what I make on paper is no where near that (shoot me!).

We've got around £100k-£120k deposit.

Questions I have are:   


1. First off any advice based off the information given above?
2. I currently offset some of my rent as a home office, around 30% of rent and utilities, so almost £500pm. Is there anyway to tack this on? Obviously if I'm moving and relocating home office to the new house also - I wouldn't still be paying the £500pm at the old place (obviously), it would be from the cost of the mortgage that I would be claiming as an expense.
3. I'm about to sign a contract for £30k worth of work over the next 12 months, holding fire on signing for now incase this can potentially help me in anyway? is there anything specific that the contract would have to contain in order for me to be able to use it as proof of income? If it's even possible.
4. Related to above question. If above is possible, and is pulled off, is there any way to get a mortgage company see the £30k contract as income ON TOP OF current earnings?
5. Are there any potential legal repercussions to what I'm suggesting?
6. Mortgage advisor recommendations would be great!

Sorry, I know that was a lot, haha! Writing this post made me feel like I'm in the wrong subreddit - ILLPT might have been a better option, lol. In all seriousness though - I know we can afford it, I just don't know how to prove it.

Thanks in advance, appreciate any advice/help.

***Questions are:***

1. ***Is there a way to almost 'reverse' putting home office as an expense on tax return to show higher proof of earnings? £500 per month on current home is deducted for office, but I won't be paying this on top of the mortgage on the new home.***
2. ***Can you use a retainer contract as a self employed person to prove income? If so, what does it need to include?***
3. ***If above is possible, is there any way to get mortgage company to view the retainer contract as if it's ON TOP of current earnings?***
4. **Are there any potential legal repercussions to what I'm suggesting?**
5. ***Mortgage advisor recommendations would be great!***",finance,1648048040.0

Someone told me that I could ""borrow"" from my 401k to pay it down, but I don't know enough about that process. It sounds like a risky move.

I also have a couple grand I can put towards the balance, but it's mentally difficult to throw some savings toward it.

Are balance transfers a good thing for this amount of debt?

personalfinance,I moved mid-year and am having trouble with my taxes this time. How do I find a good tax professional?,"My taxes, while never super straight-forward, were simple enough i've always done it myself with TurboTax. I moved mid-year in 2021 though and trying to do my taxes through TT has been a pain. Lots of confusing questions, some of which seem to drastically swing the tax bill. After trying myself it looks like I owe 4k federally and 1.5k in each state I lived so I think it's worth going to a tax professional this year just to make sure I didn't screw things up.

I've never been to one before and neither have any of my friends (so no recommendations). How do I find a good one? I'd assume the big name places like HRBlock are probably no good. Any advice?",finance,1648049050.0

personalfinance,Student loan repayment after graduation and other monthly expenses,"Hi PF, I have two (related) main topics with questions on them:

  
First Topic:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm graduating with a Bachelor's in May  and I have $16,500 in direct subsidized federal student loans. These show a payment date start on November of this year. Will that date change once I graduate in May and interest will begin accumulating then, or will it really wait until November?

&amp;#x200B;

If it changes in May, could I go back to school at community college to finish my Associates to keep the 'in school' status so interest stays at 0%?

&amp;#x200B;

Second Topic:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a job lined up that will double what I'm currently making at my internships. I'm currently making around $2k a month, so I will be making around 4k a month (net). My current monthly expenses vary from $1.5-1.8k depending on how hard I try to save.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to pay off my loans ($16,500) as soon as possible so I don't end up paying a lot of interest in the end. I also don't want to dry myself and still contribute to savings, and I assume 401k once I start working. I'm not sure how to budget around this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Initially I thought of putting $1k into loan repayment, leaving me with $1.2-1.5k after expenses that I would just save up. Then I remembered of 401k and realized I have no idea how that would affect my monthly expenses since I do want to put something towards it. Not to mention any other monthly expenses I might not know of once I enter the workforce

&amp;#x200B;

My main question then is: should I prioritize my 401k and tank more debt by lowering my loan payments? Or is it better to pay off the loans asap with smaller contributions to 401k?",finance,1648050993.0
personalfinance,Paying off 6% student loans vs saving for a house.,"I hope this doesn't break the rules of where to post, since this is a sort of typical ""this is my situation what is your advice"" question, but here we are:

**My question**: I have $12k saved. Going forward, should I pay down $18k in student loans (~~6% interest~~, may be wrong about this, see edit below) or save for a house and buy sometime in the next year or so.

**My situation**: I'm 40y.o. and I've done steps 1-5 in the flowchart, maxing HSA, IRA, employer match, etc. I can save $2000 a month going forward. 

**More thoughts and info**: My work is remote permanently, and I'd love to finally own a house and settle in and stop moving. If I saved for a few more months I could put ~5-10% down on a house and have monthly payments below 1/3 of take home income. On the other hand, I could aggressively pay off my student loans and then have a couple of hundred extra per month.

I'm inclined to save and buy when ready, and then dump any extra monthly money toward paying off the student loans, but would be interested in hearing thoughts either way. Thanks for your time!

[Edit] I should have said that I just graduated from grad school, which is where the debt comes from. I paid off my undergrad debt a long time ago and it was glorious. Also, looking at it again, I'm not sure whether it's 4% or 6% interest. Right now it says 0% because of COVID forbearance, but that will change in May.

[Edit] Thanks everyone for your comments. Interesting varied set of responses and several good points I had thought of. Now I just need to figure it out. I will probably hedge my bets by saving for the next few months and seeing if I can find a house that I want, and if not or if interest rates are nuts or something changes drastically then I'll let that guide my decision.",finance,1648051933.0

personalfinance,Speak to a Local Credit Union before Financing through a Car Dealership,"For context, me (23M) and my partner (23F) have recently been in the market for new or new to us vehicles. We both make very good money for our age, grossing roughly $125k a year together in a MCOL area. We also have good credit, with mine being a bit better than hers due to a longer age of credit history, but essentially our credit scores going into this process were 750ish for me, and 730ish for her. 

I was able to find a reasonably priced used vehicle at CarMax and was instantly approved for a 5 year, 2.9% interest rate loan with no hassle. No problems here.

Conversely, we ordered a new vehicle from the factory to be sent to a dealer near us for her. When the vehicle arrived, the dealership took her credit application for a 6 year loan with 20% down payment and quoted us an interest rate of… wait for it… 11%!!! I was literally baffled by this difference between my and her interest rates and heavily questioned the dealer, demanding her credit report, etc. The dealer told us that she had only been approved for a loan through a few small banks, and they all had high interest rates. Long story short, I feel that we were put between a rock and a hard place because we had been waiting months for this vehicle and had driven 2 hours to the dealership to get it. So, I decided it would be best to do the deal and try to refinance somewhere else as soon as possible.

After receiving her registration and license plate, I immediately contacted a local credit union, and within the day, she was refinanced at a reasonable 3.99% rate for the 6 year loan.

personalfinance,401(k) loan vs HELOC draw,"I have a small business and I use multiple sources of funding for liquidity and reserves including 401(k) loans and a HELOC. 

  
Say I am doing a project in the business that I need $10k to run and won't pay back a dime until 1 year.  I know I'm going to do this project so it's just a matter of funding it properly.    


Luckily for easy math both have a 4.5% interest rate!   


I would keep the balance at approximately $10k over the year in either case by doing additional small draws from the HELOC as the initial loan payments get too much to handle.  That makes it so in one year when I pay off the loan, I've paid $10,450 total, either way, so my checking account balance isn't affected.  


However:  


If I used the 401(k) loan initially, I'd miss out on the returns that happened over that year for the $10,000 loan balance.  Say the initial 401(k) balance was $110k at the start of the project and the return of my portfolio was 8%:    


If I used the HELOC, my 401(k) balance would be $118,800, since I got 8% on the full 110k  


If I used the 401(k) loan, my balance would be $100k + $8,000 growth + $450 loan interest + $10k loan principle = $118,450   


So the 401(k) loan is always going to be more expensive unless the market returns less than the interest rate, right?",finance,1648065431.0

personalfinance,Stay somewhere pricey or move to save a little money?,"I hope this is in the right place - I apologize if not. I found out that when my lease is up at the end of July, my roommate plans to move out by herself. I live in an east coast city in a small 3 bedroom house (the rent is reasonable enough, and the third bedroom small enough, that this house works well as a 2-roommate situation). We just moved here last summer and I was hoping to live with her for at least another year. I am devastated by this news - I love everything about where I live so much and our living arrangement was working well for me. I know I have a decent amount of time to decide what to do, but I'm a planner and I'm weighing out what I see as my three options:

1. Try to find a roommate to live here with me. Pros - my rent/utilities would be the same and I would continue to have a decent amount of disposable income. Cons - I am getting tired of living with roommates and I'm pretty picky about who I would want to live with. I don't really want random roommates at this point in my life and I don't know anyone who I'd be compatible to live with who will be looking for housing in that timeframe. I am at home a lot because of the pandemic - I work from home and don't really go out - and maintaining my space in a specific way is pretty important to me. This is probably my least favorite option. 
2. Try to stay here by myself and fully take on rent/utilities. Pros - I love my house/neighborhood and get to stay in it. Cons - my rent/utilities double and I have far less disposable income. 
3. I move out and try to find a cheaper place on my own. Pros - I would likely be able to find a place for less than the full rent of this house that fits most of my needs. Cons - I would have to leave a space I truly love and move again. I might not be able to stay in my neighborhood or have all the amenities I want to have.

The other pertinent info to my situation:

* I'm in my mid-20s with no dependents. I have a stable nonprofit job where I just got a &gt;20% raise and promotion. I have fully employer paid healthcare. I work from home and that will not change anytime soon. I typically get a 5% raise annually but would like to ask for 10% at the end of this year (but neither raise is guaranteed).
* I have \~$16.5k in savings (in a high-yield account). I have maybe a couple thousand dollars in investments. I have a 403(b) with employer match and I currently deduct the percentage that gets matched. The only debt I have is federal student loans. I'm on an income driven repayment plan and am working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness (I'm \~3 years in). I pay as little as I possibly can on them - before the pandemic payment pause, I owed \~$175/mo but I'm not sure if that amount will increase now that I make more money.
* I currently bring in just over $3.4k/mo (2 paychecks = $3.1k and I get paid every other week) and my expenses are typically somewhere between $2.5-2.7k/mo. I do have a budget but I'm not very strict with it since I don't have to be at the moment. I've been especially loose with it recently but if I don't overspend on BS I can keep it to $2.3-2.5k.
* If I cut out my non-essential expenses and set a realistic but stricter budget for myself, if I took on the rent and utilities by myself, I'd be spending just over $3k/mo, with about $2k of that going to rent and utilities (yes, I know that's more than the 1/3 of your budget that is recommended). 
* In my city, it would be reasonable for me to find a cheaper place for me to live by myself that would hopefully tick most of my boxes - my house's total rent is just under $1.6k/mo and based on the current market I don't think it's unreasonable that I could find a decent place for $1.3k or less. I am working with a generous estimate of $400-500/mo total for utilities at my current place but in a different, smaller space I could maybe get them down to $300-400. 
* I don't have any major savings goals - I would like to buy a house someday but I don't think that's something I can expect to do soon (or maybe at all, lol). I do want to put money aside for an expensive wedding I'll be in later this year, but I could save that money now if I started cutting back my expenses while I'm still only paying half the rent/utilities (the money I have saved now is meant to be more of an emergency fund). I also would have some things I'd need to buy that my roommate currently provides (furniture, appliances, etc.) once they move out so I should put money aside for that too.

Basically, I'm trying to figure out if it's completely stupid for me to double my housing expenses to stay somewhere I truly love and spend 90% of my time. I'm also worried about having less of a buffer if I go over budget. Regardless of what I ultimately decide to do, I think I should cut back the non-essentials now and start saving (and seeing if I really can live on a stricter budget).

personalfinance,Thought on mortgage types.,"I’m looking to buy a home and it’s been a while since my last one. I live in a much more expensive area than the first two places I bought and so I’m trying to decide between 15 year loans, 30, and ARMs. 

My best friend worked in mortgage for a long time and told me she does ARM for all her loans and she doesn’t have to put anything down and she doesn’t pay PMI with her lender (navy federal). She likes them because it lets you get in at a lower rate and then you can use money you have saved for down payment to make updates as needed to increase equity and then refinance before the rate changes. She has also said the rate with navy fed doesn’t tend to go up more than 1% and has a 5% increase cap. A house I’m interested in does need quite a few expensive updates since it historic. 

I have done 30 year loans before but I really hate paying more interest and principal and rates are higher. I have also done 15 year and like the lower rates but also understand it can be nice to not HAVE to pay a higher monthly payment and just have the option to pay more. 

Let me know your thoughts and preferably experiences with these loan types. I have never refinanced so not sure how that process goes but she said her 650k house cost her about 1500k to refinance. For reference my recent credit report has my middle score at 695.",finance,1648074243.0

Bitcoin,PSA - Ledger needs to do better. I cant access multiple wallets.,"Kind of a rant but also a serious PSA I feel. I currently have 4 wallets that are inaccessible. Sure it may be my fault or maybe im just paranoid but I feel a hardware wallet manufacture needs to realize the sensitivity of being able to access their devices. Lets get into the issue and backstory.

Its 2013-2016 and im pretty heavily into bitcoin. I end up locking a lot of bitcoin in various hardware wallets throughout these years. Mostly because I was a sucker for new tech at conventions.

Flash forward to today and I have a dozen or so hardware wallets I am going though and recovering all these coins. Another company that I will not mention went very smoothly. Then I get to the ledger wallets.

Im taking things very cautiously because I believe the ledger wallets have the most in them. I have 2 original nanos for instance but only one seed phrase so I want to load the wallets in their current state. The original nano is not supported in any of ledgers software and ledger does not host any previous versions of their software. I have a support ticket in but based on my last interaction with them im not hopeful

Then we come to the real kick in the nuts. The Ledger Blue. Their flagship device I sunk multiple bitcoin into purchasing a set of 3. On top of the developer kit I overpaid for then got stiffed on support form ledger on. But I wont get into that.

When I began working on this recovery the ledger blue was technically supported in their software however it required I update my firmware. But there was no firmware available. When I contacted support they offered me a nano x as compensation? I tried to explain I NEEDED to load the devices in their current state as potentially a lot of money was on the line. No dice, take a nano x or leave it.

Now a month or two later the blue is not supported at all. Its just wiped from their product line.

So here I am with 4 ledger wallets which I do not know if I have the correct seed phrases for and are completely unusable in their current state. Should I have been better with seed phrases? Absolutely. Could I have everything I need and am being paranoid? Absolutely. But that isn't the point.

The point here is Ledger has a history of discontinuing products and no longer offering their support without notice. As a hardware wallet manufacture I feel they need to do better and realize having a way to access these devices is extremely important. There was no explanation given for the ledger blue's which I wasted oh so much money on. Was there a vulnerability they didnt disclose that killed the product?

Anyways That is my rant. Tell me im an idiot for not making sure I knew which seed phrase was what and that I had them all. Or bitch about ledger with me. Up to you.

tldr; Ledger killed support for the original nano and flagship ledger blue and have provided no way to access these devices. Instead they are offering you a nano x for the trouble.

EDIT: I was able to access one of the 2 original nano's via electrum. It was the one I had the seed phrase for as I imported that into electrum and got the same wallet. The other is confirmed to have a different pin so thats on me and I will work on that pin.

I have not tried the Blue's on electrum but will tomorrow!   


Edit 2: Downvote away but I don't feel providing access to the devices long term is an outrageous request for a company making hardware wallets. Thankfully the open source community came through with Electrum. It loaded just fine with firmware from 2014.",cryptocurrency,1648090463.0
personalfinance,Mortgage rates by September or October 2022,"I've signed for a house which will close around September or October 2022. I will only be able to fix on a mortgage rate as I come closer to the closing date. Currently 30 year mortgage is at around 4.87%, the way interest rates are going I'm not sure where the interest rates will end up on by the time I close my house. 

While it's hard to predict rates in this volatile market, what is the worse we can expect 6-7 months from now? can the mortgage rates hit 6-8%?

personalfinance,should rent an apartment for another year or buy a starter home now?,"I got about a week to decide whether to sign a 12 month lease renting an apartment ($1400) or purchasing a starter home ($150k). Problem is, I'm not sure how long I will live at the city I'm in. It'll be at least 1 year, maybe 1.5. After that, I plan to rent it out and become a landlord from afar. I might also live in the house during the time that it is vacant for perhaps 5 or 6 month at a time, as I like the city and want to revisit in the future (my job is remote). So perhaps I can rent it out, and when the lease is over, I can live in the house for awhile, and then find another tenant, etc..

I'm in my early 30s and I got just enough cash to buy it outright, though with the interest rate rising I wonder if I should finance (20% down) and take advantage of leveraging...perhaps buying another property elsewhere next year. 

That being said, I hope you can advise on whether it's better to rent another year or buy right now. If it's close then I'll buy. The advantage of renting is that a year from now, I'd have a more clear idea of my future (and where I want to settle down). Housing price might also drop by then (due to recession that everyone is talking about?)

The property tax and HOA cost would run me $400 per month. My monthly payment if I buy would be $1400 (same as renting, if I do 15 years fixed, assume \`\`\`3% APR), but I get to build a few thousand dollars worth of equity in 1 year. So even in the worst case scenario I sell it after a year (assume at the price I paid for), the small amount of equity would make up for realtor's fees. I feel mathematically it's close. But then I get the flexibility as opposed to moving when my lease is up. And if I wanted to stay longer, I would be ahead. Beside, I don't have to sell even if I move away. Like I said, I can be a landlord from afar (I got friends who can probably manage somethings for me...)

So please, let me know what you think. First, should I buy or rent? And secondly, if I buy, should I finance or pay cash?

\~Army of Spies",cryptocurrency,1648103221.0
CryptoCurrency,Why would anyone in their right minds still be holding Tether or buying Tether?,"Why would anyone continue to hold Tether or buy Tether considering the risk involved? It just doesn't seem to make any sense to me whatsoever.

The whole point of stablecoins is that they are supposed to be the lowest risk crypto asset, offering the most security and stability, akin to a US Treasury or a money market mutual fund (although unfortunately stablecoins by themselves don't offer any yield). Tether is not the lowest risk.

Here is a long post outlining the risk of Tether, with plenty of associated reading in respected publications.

Tether openly admits, on their transparency page, that it's not backed 1:1 by cash equivalents, like it used to claim.

[https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports)

Only 84% are ""cash equivalents"". And of that 84%, a whopping 52% of it is commercial paper. And it doesn't disclose what kind of commercial paper it is, or which companies are offering it. But it's definitely not US commercial paper.

&gt;But \[Tether's\] reported accumulation \[of commercial paper\] has largely gone unnoticed on Wall Street, according to several of the biggest players in the market including bank traders, analysts and money market funds. “We’ve got lots of inquiries and heard lots of discussion, but have not seen any active participation,” said Deborah Cunningham at Federated Hermes. “Until last week we hadn’t really heard of them,” said a trader at a large bank. “It was news to us.”

Excerpt taken from this FT article: [https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a](https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a)

Given the fact that it's not US commercial paper, the avenues for redeeming it to actual US dollars are complicated and would require some kind of currency exchange.

Tether actually used to have a HIGHER share of commercial paper, but it used a lot of cash and sold some commercial paper to buy more treasuries.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/tether-says-massive-reserves-held-in-investment-grade-commercial-paper-11628595520](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tether-says-massive-reserves-held-in-investment-grade-commercial-paper-11628595520)

Guess what is happening in the bond market right now? The Federal Reserve is committed to raising rates to fight inflation. When rates go up, yields go up. When yields go up, the price of treasuries goes down. Longer term treasuries are more affected by this phenomenon. I can't seem to find any source revealing if Tether's treasuries are actually ""bills"", as Tether claims, or longer term.

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/what-are-differences-between-treasury-bond-and-treasury-note-and-treasury-bill-tbill.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/what-are-differences-between-treasury-bond-and-treasury-note-and-treasury-bill-tbill.asp)

This means Tether is at best, AT BEST, even if it's being honest, comparable to a prime money market mutual fund, albeit with questionable ability to liquidate its reserves in a timely manner at the price it bought them, and very little transparency to determine its actual holdings.

In fact, Tether was sued by the NY AG after an investigation found it was lying about its claimed reserves (and only afterwards, Tether started publishing its limited transparency reports). And it performed some funny fund manipulation with Bitfinex to get the first one audited.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-firms-bitfinex-tether-settle-new-york-attorney-generals-probe-11614093709](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-firms-bitfinex-tether-settle-new-york-attorney-generals-probe-11614093709)

[https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal)

Much like Tether is the first crypto quasi prime money market fund, the Reserve Primary Fund was the first money market fund, and eventually accumulated a lot of US commercial paper (money market funds aim to exchange at $1 NAV, with higher returns for higher risk assets e.g. commercial paper). Unfortunately, some of it was Lehman paper. Back in the crash in 2008, it ""broke the buck"" and started redeeming at $.97.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve\_Primary\_Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Primary_Fund)

Thankfully it was orderly liquidated and managed to slowly pay back $.99 to fund holders who waited it out through the legal action. But the last distribution wasn't made until 2014, 6 years later.

[http://www.primary-yieldplus-inliquidation.com/pdf/Fund-Update-92314.pdf](http://www.primary-yieldplus-inliquidation.com/pdf/Fund-Update-92314.pdf)

It's not clear to me if holders of Tether have similar legal avenues for reclaiming funds through any legal action resulting in forced liquidation.

If all this doesn't raise enough red flags, a large hedge fund, Fir Tree Capital Management, is now paying to short Tether, believing it will drop in value (break the buck), and that Tether has large exposure to Chinese real estate developers.

[https://www.ledgerinsights.com/hedge-fund-makes-short-wager-against-stablecoin-tether/](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/hedge-fund-makes-short-wager-against-stablecoin-tether/)

(In addition, the Bloomberg article referenced in the above article mentions that Genesis is also facilitating hundreds of millions of dollars in shorts on Tether).

Given all this risk, why not move out of Tether to a lower risk stablecoin of (right now at least) equal value? Why take higher risk for no return? Lower risk involves being regulated, regularly audited, fully transparent about reserves, and without a history of sloshing money around to cover claims. (There are stablecoins that fit this bill but I don't want this article to be an ad for any particular stablecoin).",cryptocurrency,1648104447.0

stocks,"Would there be significant difference between bigger, but less rate hikes vs smaller, but more often rate hikes?","Hello,

I keep seeing the new posts and opinions that FED is going to hike up to 0.5 if the inflation numbers keep hanging for a long time.

I also saw some comments that there is a possibility of having less frequent, but bigger rate hikes, for example 3 rate hikes with 0,5 points.

The other alternative is 6 rate hikes with 0,25 points.

The numbers I wrote are fiction, but could someone enlighten me and explain what economic impact both on the world and on the stock market would these shifts have? Or since the final result is the same, the frequency and size does not really matter?

Thank you for your insights in advance, guys.",finance,1648114377.0

My fiancé makes around $52,000 a year. We are hoping to save for a down payment on a house in the next 5 years. I also own my own car, but it is an older car and has high mileage (140,000 miles) and cosmetically has seen better days. The good thing though is that the engine is newer than the car and it is completely paid for. I also have around $21,000 in student loans that I am trying to pay off to free up that income. They are all federal and range from 3.7% to 5% interest, but right now are at 0%. We are currently paying $900 for rent (we split 50/50). I pay $350 for student loans, and I have been setting aside around $330 a month for a new car (around $2,500 saved so far). I also have about $3,500 set aside for emergencies. What would be the best way to accomplish my goals of:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Paying down my student loans.
2. Saving for a down payment on a house.
3. Saving for a down payment on a car.

Are these goals something I could feasibly tackle together or should I focus on one at a time?

personalfinance,When Should I take a fixed interest rate on my mortgage?,"Hi All,

A few months ago, I got a mortgage with a variable interest rate. Started at 1.9% and after 2 months, the central bank where I live issued an interest hike or .25%, so my interest rate increased naturally.

Now there is an announcement that the central bank is introducing 8 by the end of 2023, which means an increase of around 2.5% (I know that 8 increases of .25 are equal to 2% but for some reason I read that the total increase is 2.5%)

I reached out to my bank asking for an offer for a fixed rate, and their offer is: 

3 year binding- 3.19%
5 years binding-3.29%
10 years binding-3.30%

What do I do? What do I need to consider? I only have a few days to accept or reject.

Thanks",finance,1648127567.0
personalfinance,Seeing the tax/benefit amounts coming out of my income demoralizes me and I feel incredibly guilty about spending more than $100 on anything. How do you overcome this?,"I’m starting to drive my family crazy with my negativity around money. I have a government ladder position so I came in as a GS 7 making $49,322k/year and each year I will increase to GS 9 ($60,331k/year), then GS 11 ($72,995), and finally GS 12 ($87,491). But no matter how much my income increases I feel like it’s not enough. I calculate my take home pay and get absolutely demoralized by how much goes to taxes and benefits (about 37% combined). 

I’m making maybe $1000 more per year than my last job yet I bring home about $500 less per month. I was bringing about $2900 gross with the state government at $48k and when I’m making $60k I’ll only bring home like $3000 or so a month. It stings every time I see it. I’m fine with taxes if you get something for it but I feel like in the US taxes aren’t allocated appropriately and nothing like healthcare gets included. My family doesn’t understand why this affects me so much since they’re used to it and always expect to see 40% or so get deducted. But for me I feel like I’ll never get ahead and feel comfortable. Benefits with the feds are just so much more expensive than with the state. I used to be able to easily spend $1000/mo and now I’m lucky to put in 20% with barely much left for fun spending. 

I live in a HCOLA but have a good deal on rent comparatively. Only debt I have is a car payment ($270/mo) and student loan debt. Pay my credit cards off each month. Don’t live beyond my means. Save as much as I can. Yet I feel guilty for spending anythint over $100 even if it’s something that has value and makes sense. I will wear clothes and shoes until they can’t be worn anymore.  I tell myself I can’t afford things. 

I’ve been trying to build a $10k emergency fund since 2018 but something always wipes it or I have to give some to my parents to help them (which they always pay back but deducting it makes me feel anxious because I never feel safe enough to take it out). I have about $5000 as an emergency fund and I’m mad because it’s probably only double my necessary living expenses for one months. Nowhere close to the 18 months I should have for an emergency fund. 

It’s like if I spend money I get anxious and panicky because “That’s $800 I could have spent towards my car payment or put into savings”. I feel like until I have $20-30k savings as an emergency fund and can put more than the bare minimum towards retirement and have $0 debt that I’m not making enough and can’t afford anything. 

How do you get past this when you grew up poor and feel like you’ll never have enough money to feel safe and comfortable?",finance,1648130776.0
stocks,Stocks are rising despite US durable-goods orders sink 2.2% and break the winning streak...Are we missing something here?,"Orders at U.S. factories for long-lasting goods fell 2.2% in February to break a string of increases and business investment fell for the first time in a year, suggesting manufacturers are still struggling mightily with supply shortages. Orders for U.S durable goods — products meant to last at least three years — shrank for the first time in five months, the government said Thursday. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had forecast 1% decline.

The dropoff was concentrated in passenger planes and autos, two volatile categories that can swing sharply from one month to the next. Yet bookings were soft in every major category except for computers. A more accurate measure of demand, known as core orders, slipped 0.3% in the month. The core number strips out transportation and military hardware. It was first decline in 12 months.

**Big picture:** Businesses still have plenty of demand for big-ticket items despite high inflation and disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Orders for durable goods have climbed 10% over the past year. Headwinds are growing, however.

The conflict in Ukraine could tax already strained global supply chains, as could a coronavirus outbreak in China. At home, the Federal Reserve is moving to raise interest rates to try to bring down high inflation.

Economists predict U.S. growth will slow this year, but keep expanding at a steady pace.

investing,Do you guys watch the Bond Yields?,"Before you invest, are you making sure your watching bond yields ?

The first  thing I  learned when working on wall street was to watch bond yields. As yields go up, stocks go down, as yields go down stocks go up.

In 2020, 2021 Yields have for the most part gone down. In 2022 however they will likely only go up (given the fed doesn't back down).

Compared to **JUST 6 MONTHS AGO**, Bonds are up:

US 2Yr up 690%

US 5yr up 204%

US 10yr up 64%

US 30 yr up 31%

This rate of increase is unprecedented. (because rates are moving from the lowest lows, to higher) For reference, the debt crisis that caused 2008 was, among other things, caused by a 30% increase in the US 10yr (from 3.9 to 5.1). Also want to mention that this yield increase happened over the course of 1.5 years, not a few months like we're seeing today.

Example, the monthly payment for a $300,000.00 mortgage loan in the past 6 months has gone from $1,292 (figured 3.1%) to $1,626 (figured 5%).

AKA our economy is grinding to a halt.

I'm hoping to start a discussion, what do you think? What are you doing with your money? When does the system crack, is it within the next few months since were rising so fast, or will this take another year or two to play out?

&amp;amp;#x200B;

\-I've been shorting bonds, TTT &amp;amp; TYO since October of last year.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Mortgage or Refinance? Need guidance.,"Not sure what to do…

I’m in a weird situation. I may just be ignorant to the workings of the world. Just need guidance. 

I moved for a job. My job bought a home for me. They put it in my name. The deed, land, everything. I made an agreement to pay a “mortgage” to them for 2 years. I decided with interest rates rising I needed to go ahead and get a mortgage in my name. 

I have my old home, still. I was renting it, but now have decided to sell. I need 50k for repairs and improvements. 

I talked to my owner where I work, and he said I should take out a larger mortgage to fund the improvements for the other house and officially purchase the house I am in now. I make enough money to cover both, but ultimate goal is to get to 1 mortgage. 

I reach out and now I am pre-approved for 275,000. I owe my company 206,000. I asked for more on the loan just in case for fee’s or other expenses and to cover the costs of repairs on the old home. 

I message my company today just asking for guidance on what to do next, and he said that everything is in my name, I just need to refinance. ?????

This is where I am confused. Where do I go from here? Contact a real estate agent and have them set everything up? If the house is in my name already, how do I take a loan out to buy a house from myself to pay back the original loan to my company?

So I sold my house in the seattle area for a $96K profit (before taxes and expenses). This was a duplex that I lived in for 15 months then rented out both sides. I sold it in September of 2021. Now doing my taxes and living in CA I now owe 62k in taxes ($40k fed and $21k CA) according to H&amp;R Block. Now I will be talking to a CPA on April 1 keep that in mind.

Purchase price of home $335K (2018)

Sold home for $431.5K (2021)

My W2 $90K max taxes

Wife W2 $49K max taxes

Rental income $18.5K

Depreciation total $8K

Repairs $3.4K

Many were saying this has to be wrong. People were talking about schedule D and this is what HR block said when I asked.

Capital gains are calculated using the amount you bought the property for, minus expenses of the sale (commissions and legal fees) and adding back the depreciation credit for the years it was listed as a rental. 

That amount is then carried to the Schedule D and added to any amounts from sales of stock or crypto-currencies (in your case a loss of 2,400). 

Then that total from Schedule D is included in your income for the year, and taxed at either your regular tax rate, or if your tax rate is 22% or higher, a capital gains rate of 32% applies.",finance,1648136245.0
personalfinance,Anxiety moving and starting a new job,"I'm a 34 year old male living in Cleveland that's really tired of living with cold weather. I have $63,000 left to pay off my house and I think I can sell it for around $150k.

My friend started a company in Phoenix where I've visited before and loved it so I could be set with a new job. Also I have another friend that has a 2 bedroom apartment I could stay at until I find something.

My only debt is a car payment in which I owe 16k on with a .9% interest rate. 

I have about 10k in crypto/stocks and another 5k in savings. 

My plan is to sell everything that I can't fit in my car and basically start over. I'm just worried I don't have enough money saved and also not sure how taxes work on selling a house.  

If anyone has done a big move like this that could give me pointers that would be awesome.  I know I'll miss my family and friends but I really don't think I could do another Cleveland winter.

personalfinance,Mortgage Approval After Extended Vacation (8+ months),"Wondering what my chances are of getting approved for a mortgage this year given the following circumstances. Looking to buy a condo in the $300-400k range in Denver. Mainly I am concerned because I don't have 2 years of straight employment history due to a recent long trip.

I (30m) quit my job in May of 2020, traveled for 8 months or so, moved to a new city, and finally got a new job in February 2021. Was working consistently in the banking industry for 5+ years before quitting. I have been at the same company ever since and just recently was promoted. The job is stable and income will likely increase again very soon by another 10% or so.

Industry: Fintech

Income: ~$100k +/- a few % depending on stock performance. $90k base, $9k bonus, $10k RSU.

Assets: ~$225k in taxable brokerage, ~$100k in retirement accounts, $90k in cash for e-fund/downpayment.

Debt: Nothing outside of $5k in fed student loans. I own my car outright and pay off CC every month.


Would a lender be able to approve that given the above, or do I have to wait another year and keep renting until I've been at my job for 2 years? I've heard mixed things about the employment history requirement, especially after an extended break over 6 months.

Thank you in advance!",finance,1648137040.0
CryptoCurrency,A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)

 [https://www.mbcg.io/learn-more](https://www.mbcg.io/learn-more) 

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,992,543 BTC out there at a cost of 43,837.39.

That means, the market cap is 43,837.39 x 18,992,543 = 832,583,514,582.77 (832B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,713,300,598. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is 1.17 that means the market cap for Cardano is 1.27 X 33,713,300,598 = 39,444,561,699.66 (39B)

You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.

132,670,764,300 + ((10,000\*60\*24\*351) = 137,725,164,300 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)  
137,725,164,300 \* 1 = 137,725,164,300

You'll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594 \* 30 = 963,828,827,820

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.05 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

solar,Federal tax credit on electrical panels w/ solar install?,"Hi all,

I've heard that if you do an electrical panel install/update/upgrade as part of a solar install project, it can qualify towards the Federal tax credit. How exactly does it work? Do you have to use the same company to install the electrical panel as you do for the solar install? We have an electrical panel we need to replace and update (it's an old Zinsco 100a) and it's a complex situation requiring trenching and new conduit. Many contractors don't want to deal with it and if they do it's super expensive. I got a bid from one solar company who assessed it and backed out on the electrical panel upgrade portion because it's too time intensive and complex (this is SDGE btw so there's definitely more red tape compared to SoCal Edison from what I've heard). That said, it's looking like I'll need to hire hire an electrical contractor for the panel update - if I do that, could I still qualify for the Federal tax credit? I'm intending for this to be all part of the same project of upgrading to and going solar.

If I refinance my car to lower my interest rate, will I get punished for refinancing? I am aware hard inquiry will have a small drop of only like 5 points. My score today is 790, yet if I refinance my car, how does this affect the overall score? I assume it’ll look like I paid off the loan early , BUT… a new loan with the same value with pop up in its place and my 700’s score will still be retained. Is this a safe assumption?

personalfinance,Should I regret getting pre approved for a home???,"I am considering buying a home and decided to get pre approved so I would know what I can afford and to work with a realtor. I have couple of questions around the pre approval that I was hoping this community could help me with. 

1) Is it normal when you get pre approved to only receive the loan amount and not the interest rate if you don’t have an offer on a home? I know the interest rates are changing often but I don’t know how I would be able to compare with another lender if I don’t have an interest rate. 

2) If I decide to wait and not buy a house and my pre approval expires, am I allowed to start the pre approval process over again and shop around with different lenders? I’m on the fence about buying a home right now due to the competitive market so I’m not even sure it’s worth it to compare rates with another lender. I heard it could ding your credit to shop around with different lenders once you’ve been pre approved but wanted to know if I waited 6 months or a year from now and started the process over once I found a home if that would be okay to get different quotes.

personalfinance,Need Advice for Paying for College with high EFC/FAFSA not Completed on time.,"Hello everyone, I need some advice about how to pay for college as right now I am very stressed and overwhelmed. Currently, my parents have said that they will pay for a year of my college and my grandparents have money in an investment account that will pay for almost another year, which leaves 2 years for me to pay. I live in New Hampshire, which has very high in-state tuition, so the estimated cost of attendance for my school is $35,000 per year. Because of my average high school grades I am having difficulty securing scholarships, I am applying for as many as I can find but I am not hopeful that I will be able to make any significant contributions to this cost through scholarships alone.

Last year, when I filled out the FAFSA, my EFC was around $33,000, and the aid package I recieved from my school was a Direct Unsubsidized loan of $5,000. I decided to take a gap year to work and wait for COVID to settle down, and I have built up around $10,000 in savings plus $4,000 in an IRA. 

This year I missed my colleges deadline for filing the FAFSA (I did still fill it out, and my EFC was roughly the same as last year), so I did not get an aid package from them, leaving me and my parents to pay the full price of my first year of college ($35,000). I will probably ask my parents to pay for this year so that I can get good grades and apply for more scholarships.

I'm looking for advice on what options I have for planning for the cost of college in the future, as I really don't want to take out more than $40k in loans (the field I am entering has an average starting salary of $40k). I would also like to avoid private loans as much as possible. Is there any way on the FAFSA to indicate that my parents are only paying for one year so that I can get more money in Federal Student Loans? Should I reconsider going to college in the first place?

stocks,AAPL is now less than 5% off of its highs,"I guess I'm just interested in hearing from those who are bullish on AAPL at its current price, because I find this hard to understand.

AAPL is now trading a 29 PE which is really high given they're growing slower than the other mega cap tech names, and until very recently would trade with a PE in the mid teens. On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.

A lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher. Inflation appears to be more persistant than originally thought. And the FED will likely need to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated.

Given economic conditions have deteriorated since, what's the reasoning for AAPL to be trading near ATHs again? Have the fundamentals of the business improved so much that it offsets the heightened economic risks? I genuinely don't understand what's so attractive about this stock.",finance,1648154338.0

personalfinance,My taxes are a little more complicated this year - just had a few questions about the best way to file.,"Usually my taxes are pretty easy - I put the numbers from my W-2 into TurboTax, and get a refund.

My wife and I usually file separately since I have student loans and she doesn't, which keeps my monthly payments lower.

This year, our refund would be substantially larger filing jointly (about $1,500 each vs $300 each). I think it may be advantageous to file like this because we moved across the country last year, and she had substantially less income than normal (she stopped working for a while to get ready to move).

Last year (this tax season) we had a combined pre-tax income of about $60,000. This year, we'll have a combined income of around $100,000. My federal student loans are about $35,000, and I'm on an income-based payment plan.

I was wondering:

1. If we filed jointly this year to get a larger refund while keeping student loan payments relatively low when I recertify my payment plan (my loan servicer already sent out an email with my payment amount when they restart, not sure if this will change once I file), would we be able to go back to filing separately next year if it's better financially?

2. If we file jointly, will we need to do anything with our employers? I have a feeling that we'll do jointly this year and separately next year.

I know there are quite a few of these posts on here but I couldn't find one similar to my budget/situation and this will be the largest purchase i've ever made. I have been saving for my first house/apartment for a while and think I am finally in position to purchase the apartment that I want. The market is obviously terrible (great timing by myself) and i've found myself slowly increasing my budget more and more.

Debt: **Zero**

Static Monthly Expenses (not including current rent): **$513**

\- this includes phone, cable, internet, utilities, Gym, Car Insurance (but not food)

\- No kids, car payments etc.

Monthly Income: \~7k after tax and 12% 401k allocation (this doesn't include side job income as that is paid periodically)

***Budget***

House Budget: $800K (absolute max) but realistically i don't want to go above **$750K**

\- I would rent out the second bedroom for \~$1,300

I anticipate monthly housing expenses to be:

**$3,533** total (assuming 750k and 20% down)

\- $2,233 monthly after rent deduction

3.5% interest rate

$250 HOA (seems to be the avg. and i wouldn't go much above it)

$108 Home Insurance

$481 Property Tax

\- Is that budget too high for my income? I am currently renting for 1,200 so its a 1k jump (if i didn't miss anything but thats a good amount more per month) which is a decent amount

financialindependence,My Personal Pay-Off-Mortgage vs. Invest The $s Experiment: Final(ish) Results,"Hi everyone, u/FullyCommittedMaybe here. Long-time-no-post. Speaking of which, I hope this meets the criteria for its own post! I've been collecting data for just over 3 years, and I finally reached a big milestone, so I figured I would spend a minute longer than usual and share real-life (albeit anecdotal) results of my mortgage vs. investment experiment. Up front, I do want to acknowledge that I have been *very fortunate* in many ways, and of course that your milage may vary.

**Background:** in January 2019, I set the goal to pay off (or have enough money to pay off) my mortgage by 1/2025 (as you might have already guessed...I beat the timeline by more than 2.5 years). I moved into the house 4/2016, so the original target would have been quite early relative to your typical 30 (or even 15) year plan, but I wanted to be aggressive. I was 31 when I set the goal, and I owed $130.5K at 2.875%.

At that time, there were regular comments (maybe there still are?) in the daily discussions with folks asking which was better -- pay off the mortgage early? Or keep the mortgage and invest surplus income in an attempt to outpace the mortgage interest rate? My gut told me to pay off the mortgage...I'd have plenty of money to invest once the payment was gone, I'd be 100% debt free, and I'd sleep better at night knowing I owned the house. But I just couldn't pull the trigger knowing that I had a great income, my interest rate is mega-mega-low, I am (sort of) young, and I can easily take on (what I would consider to be) a relatively low risk. I chose to invest the money, and I'm so glad I did. As of this month, I have enough to pay off the mortgage. So, how did the investments do vs. had I paid down the principal and saved the interest?

**Results:** 

*Scenario 1:* If I had made payments as usual (no side-investments, no extra mortgage payments), I would have paid:

* $130.5K principal
* $24.7K interest
* **$155.2K total**

*Scenario 2:* If I had used what I'm calling my surplus income ($88.8K over 39 months) to pay down the principal early (and made the payments on the same dates that I made my investments), I would have paid:

* 130.5K principal
* $7.7K interest
* **$138.2K total ($17.0K better than Scenario 1)** 

*Scenario 3* (what I actually did): I made regular investments over the course of the last 39 months in VIGAX and VTSAX until the account was large enough to pay off my mortgage (after capital gains taxes). 

* $30.5K principal (regular mortgage payments)
* $10.9K interest (regular mortgage payments)
* $88.8K investment
* **Total ""paid"" by me**: $129.7K
* Total growth: $21.0K (which will generate roughly $3.2K in taxes)
* If I sell, pay taxes, and pay off the mortgage in full today, I will have $6.1K remaining
* **Total cost to me (since I have $6.1K remaining) = $123.6K ($31.7K better than Scenario 1, $14.7K better than Scenario 2)**

**Takeaways:**

1. Given the market is down YTD, this is perfect timing to conclude and reflect on the experiment. Many of my friends and family feel that there is too much uncertainty in the market to put a large chunk of extra cash into it. COVID, gas prices, attempted reversal of a presidential election, war, etc. Lots to be afraid of, and the news will always remind you of that. But the gains of the last few years (which were, admittedly, tremendous) overshadow my YTD results in a big way. I'm glad I did not miss out on all those gains!
2. My investment loss is -$12.5K YTD in this investment account. So even with all the uncertainty and the losses, I still came out way ahead in the long run. I know this is only a 39 month experiment, but it's a good reminder that my personal philosophy is to focus on long-term strategies.
3. The reason the title says ""Final-ish Results"" is because I am not cashing out. In scenarios 1 and 2, the payoff dates would not yet be here. The money still has time to grow (or shrink!) before I hit the payoff dates in those scenarios. My suspicion is that it grows and I'm even further ahead.
4. Obviously I am fortunate beyond belief in terms of the market, income, stimulus, etc. Just want to acknowledge that one more time.
5. Looking back, it seems silly that I ever considered *not* doing this. It is such a small risk relative to the potential reward, in my opinion.

* Was able to get a low interest rate due to my good credit (~780)

... but after having it for a year, despite it not feeling much like a financial burden, I feel like I overspent and feel like I spoiled myself too much. And honestly, I've begun disliking the territory that comes with driving a flashy sports car - everyone looks, and I can feel everyone judging me heavily as I'm a really young looking guy.

So I've been thinking about replacing it with a cheaper hot hatchback - something like a $35k Honda Civic Type R later on in the year. Given my current loan situation/trade in, I'd have about $10k in equity towards the car which I'd use as the down payment and take out a loan for $25,000, hopefully at the same 2.99% I was at from my credit union.

Is it really worth doing all this and taking the sales tax loss again to save the $250-300 a month? Or do I just keep and enjoy the Supra for a couple more years?",finance,1648179293.0
personalfinance,What to do with cash in the bank?,"So. I (30f) have this issue about keeping too much cash in the bank. I told my husband that this is for an emergency fund which is one year worth of gross salary. But I also know that I'm just losing money by keeping it there. The current amount is $150k. 

I have this irrational fear of not having enough cash for emergencies. Husband said there could be some sort of financial vehicle such that I still keep liquidity somehow but not just keep it in a savings account and lose money from inflation. 

I'd like to hear recommendations from you, financially savvy people, about options of where I should put this money in.

I don't have any other debt except for our new house mortgage. We plan to pay this off in maybe 5 years but should I just put the money and pay more principal now? Our interest rate is 2.75% so pretty low. 

Aside from maxing out employer-matched 401k, what other steps should I do?

We also have a shared taxable account where we already chucked money in for several stocks and a divo. My husband only keeps 4 digits in his savings account and chucks the rest into this taxable account. I also already put money there last year. Should I just put more money in this divo then?

How about IRA? I don't have this yet. I know the general difference between traditional and Roth but is one actually better than the other depending on where you are in life? The APY for IRA with Navy Fed looks super low... Where do you guys do your IRA?

Keen to hear your opinions. Thanks!

EDIT : I suppose there's a lot I don't yet know about IRA so I'll go do my research first. The entire ""prep for retirement early"" just makes me so anxious. But I should do my own research first. Thanks folks!",finance,1648179454.0

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14).

Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

Here’s some analysis of the EU MiCA draft language guessing that there’s a good chance it will pass today (March 14) but that it might be removed during “Trilogues” which will be the subsequent informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission.

personalfinance,Moving forward two HELOC simultaneously - can one bank know about the other procedure before closing the deal?,"I started the process with Bank of America (online appraisal done), and with XXXX Credit Union (in person appraiser came, he needs to provide number soon). Bank of America asked if I had started the HELOC process with other banks, and I said ""yes, with XXXXX Credit Union"" . As a bank of America 13-yo customer, I will get a much better interest rate than XXXXX Credit Union (1% lower). However, XXXXX Credit Union will be faster at closing the deal (1-2 weeks from now), while bank of America estimates 3-4 weeks from now. I need to pay the contractor 100k for renovation in 2 and half weeks and I am on a tight schedule. We are talking 250k maximum in the HELOC with both banks (I have 400k equity in the house, mortgage fully paid). Problem is: bank of America said it won't proceed if I don't provide a cancellation note from the other bank (I didn't provide them with the other bank  name) saying I canceled the procedure. By canceling the procedure with Florida, I am afraid that, if bank of America rejects my HELOC, I need to restart everything with Florida Union and have to postpone payment to the contractor and freeze renovation. My credit score is 755, so I should get the HELOC, but who knows, I am here with a green card, but with a 120k job. I was thinking to tell bank of America that I got confused, it was just a prequalification for a personal line of credit not a HELOC, and to provide a signed by me document that says I don't intend to finalize any HELOC with other banks as long as bank of America approves its HELOC. So hopefully they can close the deal earlier and I can still proceed with XXXX Credit Union until before closure without signing the documents. Can bank of America get to know I have a procedure openwith XXXXX  da Credit Union? Any risk? What would you do?

I'm having some difficulty making a decision about how to pay for this. The programs are both just below $20000 a year and two years long.

The field I work in is not high paying most of the time, but does have a high earning potential.

Bitcoin,Businesses In Florida Will Soon Pay Taxes In Bitcoin,"Florida governor, Ron DeSantis explained at a press conference on Tuesday that he’s spoken with state agencies and told them to figure out ways for businesses to pay tax with cryptocurrencies. During the signing ceremony for a bill focused on financial literacy, DeSantis said that the government is working on accepting bitcoin “for payments in the state of Florida.”

On Tuesday, Ron DeSantis, the 46th governor of Florida appeared at a press conference with fellow colleagues in order to sign a bill that mandates financial literacy in schools throughout the state. 

DeSantis touched on many subjects as Florida’s governor noted that he is concerned about U.S. president Joe Biden’s recent digital currency-focused executive order. 

According to DeSantis, there’s a lack of understanding when it comes to decentralized crypto assets and centralized digital bank currencies (CBDCs).

This will improve the usage of crypto trading platforms and copy trading Ecosystems like Coinbase, Binance, Tycoon and KuCoin. 

It’s not the first time Florida governor Ron DeSantis mentioned accepting bitcoin for the state’s taxes. Last year in December, DeSantis spoke in great detail about pushing Florida toward being “crypto-friendly.”

“There’s a difference between a decentralized digital cryptocurrency like bitcoin and what some are talking about doing at the federal level to convert U.S. dollars into basically a digital currency,” DeSantis said. “I think there’s a lot of hazards with that, when that’s centrally controlled. 

I worry about the amount of power that [it] would give someone in a central authority to basically be able to shut off access to purchasing certain goods. We’d be in uncharted territory,” the governor added.",cryptocurrency,1648193671.0

personalfinance,Taxes being withheld in brokerage account,"I just received a dividend distribution from my VXUS holdings in my taxable brokerage account through Fidelity.

I just opened this account in 2022. How would Fidelity already have that notice to withhold taxes when it's a brand new account?

I also can't understand why I'm having taxes withheld at all. I've always gotten a federal tax refund. I've never had to pay in. What could have raised a red flag to create this withholding requirement?

CryptoCurrency,A rookie's knowledge about the market,"Markets won't get better this year amid Fed rate hikes and COVID-19 easing

&amp;#x200B;

Judging by recent charts and news, after the Ukraine war, Ukraine gave some insight into the role of cryptocurrencies in the war, which brought BTC to 45k in a short period of time

&amp;#x200B;

But it quickly fell back to 37,000 on news of an imminent Fed rate hike. After about 10 days of sideways trading, the Fed rate hike did not bring panic selling to the crypto market

&amp;#x200B;

So the crypto market slowly returned to near 45,000 after the Fed rate hike meeting, but this was where it was a month ago, and there is not much positive news at the moment

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at gas prices and some groceries again, they haven't eased, inflation is still high

&amp;#x200B;

So the United States will definitely raise interest rates to alleviate the inflation problem in the United States, which will bring about a decline in the market value of the crypto market, which is why I mentioned that the crypto market may not have much improvement this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus the UK has confirmed that the virus affecting the world, COVID-19, comes from a US patent for a virus discovered in a Ukrainian biochemical laboratory

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, the United States will face a PR crisis. Now the US government is facing the pressure of this kind of public opinion. On the economic front, the dollar also fell to a certain extent against the euro

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this is not what the US government wants to see. What would you do if you were Powell? If I were Powell, I would add at least 50-100 basis points to the next exchange rate to ease the inflation I'm facing right now

CryptoCurrency,"DeFi - Liquidity Pool, Lending and Single-coin staking, what are they?","Last week I researched about ALGO's Governance system ad that made me want to dip my toes a little bit deeper into DeFi. As I'm personally delving more into this land and researching the different DEXs and how things work, I thought I would do a post helping people to understand a little bit more about the opportunities of DeFi.

&amp;#x200B;

##What is APY and APR?

APR is the interest rate in a year. - 120% APR means 10% per month. Simply divide by 12.

APY is the interest rate in a year if you compound it regularly. - 120% APY (daily compounded) comes from 78.93% APR. This means if you farm there in a month without compounding, you only get 6.5%.

Both can be misleading if you're not planning to invest for at least a year. If you Liquidity Provide on something that nets 20% APR but you only do that for 6 months, you won't net the full 20% APR.

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, keep in mind that in DeFi APYs mean different things in each context.

#Lending APY

**What it is:** The easiest strategy to understand. You deposit your assets at a protocol, permissionless borrowers take that capital in exchange for collateral and interest. 

**Benefits:** Interest is paid in the same asset as borrowed, so it is great if you want single-asset exposure (lend ETH, receive interest in ETH). When markets go nuts, supply/lending APYs go up as traders take advantage of arbitrage or other opportunities and borrow more. This lets you stay on the sidelines ""safely"" while earning interest 

**Risks:**  The quality of the collateral is the biggest risk. If someone borrows your ETH but collateralizes with 3x the amount in SCAMCOIN, the collateral ratio means little. SCAMCOIN could go to $0 in a snap and faster than the protocol can liquidate the position, so the borrower keeps the ETH and you may lose everything. Protocols mitigate this risk by letting their token holders vote which assets are ""safe"" but then we are back to centralized decision making. Some DEXs (Sushi from the top of my head) allow pair-wise lending so you always know which is the collateral backing the borrower, sadly this model isn't as large yet.

# Single-coin staking APY

**What it is:** Locking your asset to support a protocol/blockchain. Very similar to lending because you earn a return on the same asset, *regardless of its USD value*. You can stake ETH to secure ETH2,  stake LUNA to secure the Terra network, etc... In most cases, you get a ""receipt token"" (eg: stETH, bLUNA) that represents your stake and which you can redeem for your base deposit + earned token at a later date. 

**Benefits:** Most staking opportunities let you vote or even propose changes via governance mechanisms proportional to your stake (similar to being a *shareholder);* besides earning a return. 

**Risks:**  When you stake your asset you are trusting the protocol will deliver value long term. SCAMCOIN paying 8000% in staking APY means nothing if the project doesn't move forward. You will receive 7x more SCAMCOIN that is worth less and less over time.

# Liquidity Pool (LP) APR 

**What it is:** Depositing (usually) two tokens that allow other people to trade those tokens. You are ""market-making"" because you supply both tokens and facilitate exchanges from token A for token B and conversely.  Traders pay fees (0.01% - 1%) and all fees are shared proportionally among all liquidity providers.  Because you are on the supply side of the market (supplying liquidity), you need to be extremely happy or extremely neutral to hold those two assets (eg. ETH + BTC) in any proportion because as prices of each asset move, the quantities of assets you provided will constantly fluctuate to keep the pool 50/50 in value. The APR quoted is always based on the trading fees from the last 24 hours divided by the total value locked in the same period multiplied by 365 days. 

**Benefits:**  You earn the trading fees. This is why you need to look for pools that have a high ""historical"" volume relative to TVL. A pool can have a high APR only because the volume in the last day skyrocketed and mislead you to invest.  When markets are choppy and trading sideways, LPs are a great strategy because you benefit from all the volatility (i.e. you sell volatility when it spikes).

**Risks:** Impermanent loss/gain. As the quantities of the tokens supplied fluctuate with market prices you are likely to withdraw fewer coins of token A than what you deposited if token A went up in value vs token B. 

# LP staking APR

**What it is:** depositing your LP tokens with a protocol in return for rewards paid in other tokens. This is also called liquidity mining because you get rewarded for providing liquidity - ""proof of liquidity"". Protocols do this to lock LP positions and ensure the protocol's native token remains easy to trade.  Protocols decide how many of their own tokens they want to spend as liquidity rewards and decide how much over time. The APR quoted is usually calculated by taking the market value of the tokens sent as rewards to the LPs, divided by the TVL. This means if the protocol decides to send 1000 tokens to the ETH-BTC pool per week, the APR will be 1000\*token price / ETH-BTC deposits. This is key because the APR is **highly dependent** of the value of the protocol's token, so it can be deceptive. 

**Benefits:** if you really believe in the protocol, you can deposit your LP and farm their token instead of buying it (and then single-stake that token for more rewards). Your LP position will keep earning fees, so you will be double stacking yields.  The rewards APR can mitigate the impermanent loss. 

**Risks:**  Protocols play with the math of APRs and usually quote the trading fees APR together with the rewards APR. A healthy APR is comprised of a higher trading fees APR than a rewards APR, otherwise, it won't be sustainable in the long term. Besides the risks of a rug pull or more complex attacks, your risk is the opportunity cost of being lured into providing liquidity for the ETH-SHIT pair, staking it for SHIT rewards, and losing money because the impermanent loss will eat your ETH and rewards will be worth 0. 

___________________________________

## Getting in:

You can check DefiLlama and then on the left side select [Top Protocols](https://defillama.com/top-protocols) and check which DEX is available in the chain of your choice. To get started, you should try the #1 Decentralized Exchange in that chain. They are:

* **ETH** - Even despite lower gas prices, you should farm ETH in MATIC or another chain instead
* **BSC** - Pancakeswap
* **AVAX** - Trader Joe
* **MATIC** - Quickswap
* **SOL** - Raydium
* **LUNA** - Terraswap
* **CRO** - VVS

The different DEXs will provide these different services I explained before. Note: Not all of them have all of these services.

## The biggest risk in Liquidity Pools is Impermanent Loss:

If the price of the 2 tokens you put into LP moves differently (percentage-wise), you get less compared to only holding those tokens. Impermanent loss also occurs should the prices rise. You still profit, however, in this case, you would have profited more if you had held.

Remember not to dabble with coins with crazy high APY/APR or projects you haven't well researched because they might be a scam or simply don't have the means to remain profitable mid/long term.",cryptocurrency,1648211479.0

&gt; The rebound has come even as the war in Ukraine continues and the Federal Reserve is set to hike interest rates several more times this year.

&gt; “Equities are rallying despite a hawkish Fed and stagflation concerns, as many believe there is no alternative to stocks,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at USB Global Wealth Management.

&gt; The news comes after President Joe Biden said Thursday at a NATO summit in Brussels that the U.S. would respond if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine.

personalfinance,More money down or sacrifice a higher monthly mortgage to invest?,"I am buying a new house because we’ve outgrown our starter. We are estimated to make anywhere from $152k to $172k on our home sale. 

The home we are buying is $495k and needs some cosmetic work but otherwise checks ALL the boxes and comes with land which we also want. 

We decided to go with a 15 year ARM at 3.6%. That is fixed for 15 years and then adjusts every 6 months but can never go higher than 8.8%. At first I was afraid of an adjustable rate, but with current fixed rates at 4.7% this seemed like a good option. It’s fixed at 3.6% and by then we can refinance into a 15 year mortgage before the rate jumps.

Having some issues with options though, can’t figure out which is best. For reference we make $160k combined, have only a $350 car payment (.9% interest rate), and no kids yet.

Option 1: Put down minimum $140k onto new house and end up with monthly mortgage of about $1980.

Option 2: Put down only 20% ($100k), use remaining $40-$60k to pay off my car ($12k left) and invest the rest. Monthly mortgage would be about $2200.

Option 3: Put down only 20%, pay $2200 in mortgage, and invest $40k-$60k.

We both have retirement plans at work but only have about $60k total in those. We are both 30 and do not have any investments yet but it’s been on our list for the next year or two. We have $35k in savings but can put away $2-$3k monthly (we focused on paying off all student debt for the past 4 years).

I shudder at a locked payment of $2200 since we come from a monthly mortgage of $900, but this would be our forever home. If anything ever happened where that payment wasn’t possible we could always recast so the rate would remain the same and we just could put a lump sum on the loan to lower the monthly. Just trying to figure out if the investments are worth the extra monthly costs…",finance,1648212356.0

SPY gained 8% and QQQ gained 13% in less than 2 weeks which seems surprising with the current environment when we have inflation out of control, high commodities prices and one of the worst fed tightening in decades.

I am not trying to time the market and I keep adding in undervalued stocks but I do not want to get dragged into ""FOMO"" rally. I am long-term bullish and I only have one cheap put contract as a small hedge. There is huge SPY puts flow but this could be MMs hedging their portfolios.

My take (not a financial advisor):

Bottom line: Nobody knows anything.

I think Fed is way behind the curve and they eventually will have to aggressive and do more rate hikes and slow economy. However, I think recession is less likely due to strong labor market. We might revisit close to Feb-Mar lows but it might not happen until Apr-May when companies start to report Q2 earnings and next FOMC meeting. QQQ might reach to \~365 and SPY to \~455 before another correction happens.

SO (42) and I (40) make about $150k gross annually combined. We live in a low COLA. Each of us has a very good pension plan (IPERS.) We both max our IRAs each year. We both contribute some post-tax and pre-tax money to our 457b plans through automatic paycheck deductions, though we are far from maxing out our contributions. We do contribute 20% of our gross income to retirement already though. There is no match from our company. We do not qualify for an HSA. We have 6 months worth of expenses saved. 

We have two children (9 &amp; 11) who will go to college. We do not have a 529 plan. I am planning on using our IRA contributions to pay for their college, since we have separate pension and investment accounts to fund our retirement. 

A couple of years ago we refinanced to a 15-year mortgage with an interest rate of 2.625%. We owe $161,520. We make biweekly payments in order to pay extra on the principal each year. The zestimate of our home value is $360,600. The county assessed it at $254,100. In April of 2020, the appraisal was $264,000.00.

I know that if we refinance now we might get a higher interest rate than we were able to get 2 years ago. But even if we end up with a 4% interest rate over 30 years, won’t the rate of return from our investment end up being closer to 10% annually in the long run? 

Is a cash-out refinance of our home mortgage a logical next step to grow our wealth? Or is there something else we should be doing instead? I don’t want to leave money on the table. TIA.",finance,1648225915.0

personalfinance,Dead end job plus health issues. Require guidance.,"I understand that I have made many mistakes, just need guidance on what to do next.

I have 1k to my name currently.

Have a boss and manager. I see boss only two days a week.

6 years ago I got a hernia at work.

Warehouse, occasional heavy lifting.
It's a small store, not a big name one.

About two weeks after it happend my boss found out about it because I missed a day and told him I went to the ER... yes, not a clinic, to get it looked at. Boss told me to put myself on his insurance. I refused as I did not want to burden him and did not have the funds for two months of rent while I recovered + post surgery medical bills.

Was charged 2k (after the discount) for the ER to tell me ""yap that's a hernia all right, but we can only fix that a month or two away.""

Boss helped me with half the bill when he noticed the letter in my work area.

I went back to work.
We had a lot to do and I did not want to dissapoint my boss or miss rent.

He asked if I could still do my job.

I told him it only occasionally hurt.

Only recently I made the choice to tell my manager that I would no longer be lifting heavy items as the doctor had suggested in a letter to my employer, again 6 years ago ""nothing over 10 pounds""

Manager huffed and still complains sometimes that ""I work less recently than I used"". I got tired of pretending. I got tired of doing things for their benefit. But mainly I was looking after my health as I am getting older.

Hernia hurts when I don't eat well and stings randomly about once a couple months.

Work schedule is flexible, that's why I never felt that a raise was in order.

Even after I took on the job of the people who would quit.

There has always been two people (aside from manager) working in the warehouse, but they either don't fit the managers outrageously high qualifications for such an entry level position or they quit two weeks later because they found something better.

Manager complained to my boss that I yelled at him when I asked him to move something heavy. Of course he neglected to mention his fault in all this.

I was direct and firm after he complained about how I wanted to organize a certain part of the warehouse. ""you have two choices; hire someone who will help me or fire me.""

I have to ignore him half the time and do other things so that work doesn't pile up. He's worked here for decades, yet shows no experience on how to plan for future orders.

Boss is no help either.

He never wants to hear my side of the story on anything. They're family and I'm sure that's why he takes his side.

Managers called me a nancy boy and other things in arabic and that's why I have no respect for him.

The last person who worked here was his son for a week. They spent 40min yelling at each other one day, nothing got done.

There are about 5 things broken in the store that need to be fixed, yet he always tries to fix them and fails or takes years to fix them because he's cheap.

He would sell you half a kiwi for 50c if he could.

Anyways, this is becoming a rant... I digress.

I'm debating wether or not I should move back in with my folks and work at something like Costco as that's in line with what I do now. And wether or not it would cause issue if I disclose the health issue.

I have medicare (medicaid) poor people insurance if that matters.

I unfortunately did not take advantage of ""year of covid, help"" to get this sorted. Sometimes I get calls that claim to help those injured at work, but I'm unsure how well that works or if it's even legit. O if too much time has passed.",finance,1648230439.0
personalfinance,Negotiating pay for extended contract,"Hello!

Where I work my contract is ending and I was offered an extension.

We are very short staffed and there and three full-time job positions that need to be filled. I’ve applied to two of them.

My contract began for the company to catch up on paperwork and they kept me on as their needs grew/changed.

I am now responsible for covering what one of the full-time positions would be doing.
It’s extremely stressful with a lot of responsibility.

They are taking a long time selecting the new hires for the full-time positions

I feel like they are only extending my contract to teach whoever they hire what I know. 

I asked for increased compensation for the contract extension. HR came back and increased my salary by $1000 a year.
Also, may I add, one year working there and I still won’t get paid sick day.

The stress from my current tasks are eating me alive. 

Should I accept?
I feel like rejecting the offer and being on EI until my next job. 
Maybe I won’t be eligible for EI if I decline an extension?",finance,1648235574.0

stocks,The curious story of how CUSIP numbers became a Wall Street battleground,"They may not be the most exciting part of the securities markets, but CUSIP numbers are indispensable. 

The arcane nine-digit ID numbers, issued by the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures, show up on everything from stocks, bonds, exchange-traded securities and mutual funds. They’re also not free. In at least two class-action lawsuits, investors are alleging that the cost of CUSIPs has been artificially inflated for decades, as a result of monopolistic control by data providers including the American Bankers Association, FactSet and S&amp;P Global.

Investors, who are seeking injunctions and damages, allege the CUSIP system’s owners and exclusive licensees aggressively sought to dampen competition from other services offering free or lower-cost alternatives.

“The motive for their exclusion of competition is simple,” says [one of the complaints](https://www.law360.com/articles/1470933/s-p-accused-of-monopolizing-use-of-securities-id-numbers) filed recently in Manhattan federal court, “CUSIPs are worthless except for the fact that they are the standard.”

## How the CUSIP system began

CUSIPs have been standard since the 1960s for identifying securities for clearing and settlement of trades. The system is owned by the ABA and a subsidiary of S&amp;P’s Global Market Intelligence, now called Factset Research Systems, which [completed its purchase](https://investor.factset.com/news-releases/news-release-details/factset-completes-acquisition-cusip-global-services) of the business from S&amp;P this month for $1.925 billion. 

The numbering system was originally a subscription service that provided physical books containing information on every financial instrument linked to a CUSIP and were updated quarterly or annually. But in the 1980s, vendors like Bloomberg began distributing the data directly and electronically to financial institutions, making it unnecessary to pay a fee to S&amp;P.

To counter the loss of revenue, S&amp;P changed its business model from a subscription service to a licensing one, and required financial firms using CUSIPs to pay substantial fees. S&amp;P inserted language in its contracts with data vendors requiring them to cut off access to the CUSIPs for any financial institution that did not enter into a license agreement with S&amp;P.

At about the same time, according to the lawsuits, ABA and S&amp;P became more aggressive in trying to maintain their stranglehold on the system.

“Monopolies are rarely good for business,” said Ronald J. Aranoff, a partner in the Litigation &amp; Dispute Resolution Group at Wollmuth Maher &amp; Deutsch LLC, which represents plaintiff Hildene Capital Management. “We trust the court to decide whether the exercise of monopoly power here was unlawful. We believe it is.”

## Flexing monopoly power

CUSIP was designated as a financial standard by a committee of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), dubbed X9. But X9 is hardly an independent body, at least according to the class action suits. The ABA established X9 during the 1970s and it, as well as S&amp;P’s CUSIP Global Services, are still connected to X9 through voting positions on the committee’s board of directors.

Hildene is an institutional asset manager headquartered in Stamford, Conn. Like all other investment managers and traders, it requires access to financial information for managing, monitoring, buying, and selling financial instruments. The company typically pays Bloomberg for access to data that includes CUSIP numbers. For Hildene, the cost of getting the data with CUSIP numbers ends up being about $10,500 a year.

“Hildene…\[is\] then left with two unenviable options: pay S&amp;P’s supracompetitive subscription rates or have CUSIP numbers stripped from their data feed and suffer, at a minimum, significant disruption to their businesses,” the lawsuit states.

solar,Would you pay for this upgrade?,"We've been getting a number of quotes for a solar system, and the system designs, in terms of where they want to put the system, are quite similar.  One company, which also happens to generally be the cheapest so far, has been much more on top of things than the others- willing to respond to inquiries about electrical work at a much earlier stage and incorporating it into the quote (80 year old 2-family house upgraded at various points w/o permits mostly = nuke from orbit), answering questions, doing a much more serious look before quoting (sending someone to look at and verify electrical stuff, take pictures of attic rafters, do a drone flyover, and doing PVWatts and Helioscope information every time they've updated the quote) and providing different options.  The two quotes they're providing right now are both for 20 Enphase iq7+ inverters, as well as 20 panels, 15 facing south, 5 facing east.  The difference is QCells G10+ 360 Watt panels vs REC Alpha 380W panels, the latter of which is being quoted at $2100 extra gross price.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 28th, 2022","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 28th, 2022.

# **Stocks could take their cue from oil, inflation and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/stocks-could-take-their-cue-from-oil-inflation-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; With the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike out of the way, market pros are now debating whether the market can continue the upswing it started in the past week.
*****
&gt; March’s employment report is coming up in the week ahead, but developments in Ukraine, the price of oil and an inflation report are likely to steer the market.
*****
&gt; Stocks notched gains for the week, while interest rates ripped higher and oil prices jumped. Energy was the top performing sector, up more than 7%, as West Texas Intermediate crude futures closed nearly 9% higher for the week. The closely-watched 10-year Treasury yield was on a tear, reaching 2.5% Friday, its highest level since May 2019 from 2.14% just a week earlier.
*****
&gt; Traders are also watching the rise interest rates to see if they will stall the market’s gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 1.8% for the week, ending Friday at 4,543.06.
*****
&gt; “Since the war started, on the ten days that were up, the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 1%,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “I don’t think next week is going to be any different. We’re going to be headline driven, whether it’s economic data, news out of Ukraine or crude oil futures.”
*****
&gt; The market has chopped around but is higher for the month of March so far. The S&amp;P was up nearly 3.9% for the month-to-date on Friday.
*****
&gt; Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said stock charts look promising for the near term but are less clear longer term.
*****
&gt; “We should take advantage of this short-term momentum. I feel pretty good about it short-term. I mean several weeks,” she said. “We’ve also seen some nice short-term breakouts... names getting above their 50-day moving averages.”
*****
&gt; She said 58% of the S&amp;P 500 companies are now above their 50-day moving averages, a positive sign for momentum. The 50-day is simply the average closing price over the past 50 sessions, and a move above it can signal more upside.
*****
&gt; Stocks like Tesla, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet have all regained their 50-day moving averages, she said. Stockton noted that some high-growth tech names have also done so. She pointed to CLOU, the Global X Cloud Computing ETF.
*****
&gt; As for yields, she said the 10-year looks set to consolidate now that it has touched 2.50%. Her next target is 2.55%. “If we get above 2.55%, the next hurdle is 3.25%,” she said.
*****
&gt; # Jobs and inflation
&gt; There is a busy economic calendar in the week ahead, highlighted by the March jobs report and personal consumption expenditures data.
*****
&gt; Consumer confidence and home price data will be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; PCE includes an inflation measure that is closely watched by the Fed. Economists expect to see core PCE inflation up by 5.5% year-over-year when it is reported Thursday, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; There is also the ISM manufacturing survey reported Friday. The key nonfarm payrolls report will also run that day.
*****
&gt; Economists expect 460,000 jobs were added in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to the 678,000 nonfarm payrolls added in February and an unemployment rate of 3.8%.
*****
&gt; “I definitely think at this point that inflation data is much more meaningful than employment, in terms of the path of the economy,” said Ben Jeffery, vice president of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. Jobs will still matter, but the Federal Reserve has pivoted to focus more on combating inflation, while the economy is reaching maximum employment.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made that point when he spoke to economists Monday, saying the central bank would be willing to be more aggressive raising interest rates to battle inflation. Stocks initially sold off on his comments, amid fears the Fed could slow the economy or even bring on a recession.
*****
&gt; Since then, stocks moved higher, but interest rates have been galloping higher. The fed funds futures market has been pricing in 50-basis-point rate hikes — or 0.5% — in both May and June.
*****
&gt; ″[Nonfarm payrolls] will matter... I do think it’s probably going to be more a story of just how far the market is willing to press the 50-basis-point rate hike narrative, which is likely to be more pressing next week,” said Jeffery. “The excitement that once surrounded jobs is definitely less so at this point in the cycle.”
*****
&gt; In the bond market, Jeffery said investors will be watching Treasury auctions Monday and Tuesday, when the government issues $151 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes.
*****
&gt; Rising oil prices have been driving inflation expectations higher, and the bond market is closely watching crude prices, as is the stock market. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up 8.8% for the week, at $113.90 per barrel Friday.
*****
&gt; # Oil heats up
&gt; “It seems like oil north of $100 has some staying power,” BMO’s Jeffery said.
*****
&gt; Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said the pattern between stocks and oil will continue to be important. When oil has spiked recently, stocks have weakened, he said. Meanwhile, when crude falls, stocks have been able to rally,
*****
&gt; “It seems like this week it was a bit more pronounced again when oil prices were rising pretty aggressively,” Arone said. “It’s got this interconnectedness to a few things — sentiment about the Ukraine conflict, how’s that going, inflation and ultimately how hawkish or dovish the Fed is going to be. I think it’s emerged as one of those binary proxies for these other elements in the market.”
*****
&gt; “It’s just a barometer for those other things — the Ukraine conflict, inflation and the Fed,” he said.
*****
&gt; Arone said as investors anticipate some sort of resolution that will end the conflict in Ukraine, but it’s not clear when. “The headlines coming out of Ukraine will continue to cause volatility,” he said. “At the margin, investors are gaining comfort with the likely outcome.”
*****
&gt; Arone said stock market fundamentals are better than some investors expect. When inflation rises, topline revenues can also go higher.
*****
&gt; “Everyone knows multiples have contracted, stocks have gotten cheaper, but one thing that’s gotten lost on investors is top-line revenues have this correlation with inflation,” he said. “Corporate profits and CPI [the consumer price index] are kind of connected. You have multiples contracting but earnings estimates are rising.”
*****
&gt; Arone said stocks are reasonably positioned and investors are getting more comfortable that there will be a favorable resolution to the war.
*****
&gt; “If we can get past the Ukraine conflict and some of the fears about the Fed and inflation, I think the fundamentals are okay,” he said.

&gt; # The Bull Market Turns Two

&gt; The bear market ended two years ago today and the subsequent bull market has clearly been an amazing ride. For some context, it was the fastest bull market to double ever, at just under 18 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Chart-1.png))**

&gt; Here’s where it ranks against the other bull markets that have doubled. You can see it is currently up 102%, making it the best bull market on its second birthday ever. 2009 was up 95%, coming in second.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-2.png))**

&gt; At the recent peak in early January, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up 114%, making it the seventh bull market to double. The annualized return of 53.4% shows just how explosive this move was off the lows and does imply some type of break could be warranted.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-3.png))**

&gt; Here’s another way to look at this bull market as it starts year three. Previous strong bull markets saw modest gains and really spent much of the third year consolidating the previous big gains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-4.png))**

&gt; “As this bull market reaches the third year of life, investors need to remember that year three of bull markets tend to be a little tamer, with the larger gains happening in year one and two,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, out of the 11 bull markets since World War II, we found that three of them ended during year three, while the ones that didn’t end saw an average gain of only 5.2%.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, year three of bull markets have returned only 5.2% on average for the S&amp;P 500, versus first year gains of 41.8% and second year gains of 12.8%, while three bull markets outright ended in year three.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-5.png))**

&gt; We expect the bull market to continue, but some bumps in the road are normal. As the bull ages, year three could provide some of those bumps.

&gt; For more on the bull market turning two and what could happen next, please watch the latest LPL Market Signals podcast with Jeff Buchbinder and Ryan Detrick, as they break it all down.

&gt; # 5 Energy Stocks Reached ATHs

&gt; Energy stocks have roared higher since the beginning of 2022, gaining a whopping 38.8% in less than three months (as of yesterday's close). This comes on the back of sharp moves higher in crude, thus implying higher margins and increased bottom line earnings per share. During the pandemic, energy stocks were among the most hurt, as a reduction in travel and economic activity led to a crash in oil markets. Although the YTD gain is certainly substantial, investors that have held energy stocks since mid-2008 are still in the red. The energy sector ETF (XLE) is still 23.0% off of its high price since the turn of the century, which occurred in June of 2014. As you can see from the chart below, XLE has broken its long-term downtrend and is nearing a breakout above 2018 levels. To retest the high of the century, XLE would need to gain another 29.8%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/XLE-since-2000-graph-032522.png))**

&gt; On March 11th of this year, the relative strength reading of XLE vs the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) since 2000 turned positive for the first time since COVID was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The ratio has since turned negative, and the reading is currently -5.0 percentage points. The relative strength had moved continuously lower from its high in 2008 through early 2021, but the recent reversal higher is substantial.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/XLE-vs-SPY-RS-032522.png))**

&gt; Although Energy has been strong as of late, only five of the 63 Energy sector stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 have hit all time highs in 2022 (to be considered, the stock must have been trading for at least five years). The five stocks are ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Matador Resources (MTDR) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). Below are the charts of these stocks since the turn of the century. The average stock on this list is up 41.3% on the year as of yesterday's close, which is only slightly greater than the performance of XLE.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/Individual-charts-032522.png))**

&gt; Not all of the increase to bears came from bulls. As shown below, neutral sentiment fell from 30.2% down to 27.8%. That is only the lowest level since the end of February. While bullish and bearish sentiment are both over a full standard deviation away from their historical averages, neutral sentiment is much more inline with its own historical average. Whereas all weeks since the start of the survey has seen neutral sentiment average a reading of 31.4%, this week's reading was only a few percentage points away.

***** 

&gt; # Bulls and Bears Swing Double Digits

&gt; There's nothing like higher prices to cure investor blues, and the last week has been a perfect example of that. AAII's weekly sentiment survey saw a double-digit increase in the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish this week with that reading rising from 22.5% up to 32.8% and matching the highest level of optimism in 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-Bulls.png))**

&gt; Those gains to bullish sentiment borrowed entirely from bears as the percentage of respondents reporting as pessimistic fell from nearly 50% of respondents down to 35.4%. The 14.4 percentage point decline marked the largest weekly decline in bearish sentiment since July 2010 when the reading had fallen by 19.27 percentage points. More recently, however, there have been a couple of other double-digit drops in bearish sentiment including a 12.3 percentage point decline in the first week of March and an 11.9 percentage point drop in December.

&gt; Bears continue to outnumber bulls, but the margin has narrowed to the smallest degree since the first week of the year. The bull-bear spread has risen to -2.6 after leaping higher by 24.7 points week over week; the largest one-week increase in the number since October 2019.

&gt; Looking at it another way, this week marked the first time since October 2019 that bullish sentiment rose by at least 10 percentage points while bearish sentiment fell by at least 10 percentage points in the same week. In the table below, we show each prior instance of simultaneous double-digit swings in bullish and bearish sentiment without another occurrence in the previous six months. As for how price action has responded to such swings in sentiment, the S&amp;P 500 has generally seen consistently positive performance in the months ahead, but only one week and one-month performance has been significantly stronger on an average or median basis than what has been the norm.

&gt; # Best Performers Since 3/14 Pivot

&gt; Early last week, the US equity market pivoted, gaining 1%+ for four consecutive days between last Tuesday and last Friday (3/15-3/18). Sentiment has shifted amongst the investing community for the time being. For now, it seems that the market may have largely priced in some of the most hawkish Fed tightening scenarios. Remember, we already saw huge drops of 50%, 60%, 70%, even 80%+ in many of the most interest-rate sensitive growth stocks before the Fed even lifted off of 0%. How much further were investors expecting them to go?

&gt; Since the 3/14 pivot, certain members of the S&amp;P 1500 have already gained over 20%, but still remain well off of 52-week highs. Of the top 35 performers since last Monday, the average stock is still 43.4% off of its 52-week highs (median: 47.1%). Although there is much recovery room left for many of these high-flyers, this is a move in the right direction. The top performing stock since the 3/14 close is GameStop (GME), which has moved 58.0% higher on the back of a 30.9% move today. This may imply that investors have increased their risk appetite, or that retail investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity, which would likely apply to the broader market from a retail perspective. Selectquote (SLQT) and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) rank immediately below GME, gaining 53.7% and 45.9% respectively. Both of these stocks are operating at a loss on the bottom line, which tells us that the risk-on trade has performed strongly over the last week. Other noteworthy names on the list include Tesla (TSLA), Avis Budget (CAR), Etsy (ETSY), NVIDIA (NVDA) and PayPal (PYPL).

&gt; Breaking this down further, the sectors that help up strongly in the face of a downturn earlier this year have performed the worst since the 3/14 pivot. Utilities and Energy members of the S&amp;P 1500 have only gained 0.6% and 2.6% on average, respectively, since last Monday. On the other hand, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Technology members of the S&amp;P 1500 have gained 7.8%, 8.1% and 10.6% on average, respectively. Based on the data below, the sectors most off their highs have rallied the most aggressively since the pivot, while the sector leaders from pre-3/14 have lagged.

&gt; # Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since the COVID Crash Lows

&gt; Two years ago to the day, the S&amp;P 500 put in a low after a 33.9% pullback from the closing high on 2/19/20. While the S&amp;P 500 is once again off its highs, the index sits just over 100% above that 3/23/20, low and 32.7% above the pre-pandemic high. In the table below, we show the current S&amp;P 500 components which have rallied the most since the COVID Crash low as well as how much each stock declined during the crash.

&gt; While it was not a member of the S&amp;P 500 at the time of the COVID crash, being added on 12/21/20, Tesla (TSLA) is currently the S&amp;P 500 member which has risen the most since the broader market low. After being more than cut in half, it has since risen over 1,000%. The next best performers are Devon Energy (DVN) and APA Corp (APA); a couple of Energy sector names that saw even larger declines of 72.8% and 84.86%, respectively from 2/19/20 to 3/23/20. Along since Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), both stocks have risen well over 800% over the past two years. Of the list of the 25 best performers in the S&amp;P 500, the only one that managed to move higher during the COVID Crash was vaccine producer Moderna (MRNA) which had risen 40.43% as the rest of the market collapsed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032322-Best-vs-Worst-2a.png))**

&gt; By the time of the 3/23/20 low, the index's worst performers since the pre-pandemic high (2/19/20) had seen monumental declines with many of those stocks dropping over 70%. On the other end of the spectrum, only four stocks had eeked out a gain and only another seven stocks had fallen single-digit percentage points.

&gt; As for what those stocks have done since then, below we have created equal weight indices comprised of the S&amp;P 500 members that are still actively traded that were the 20 best and 20 worst performers from 2/19/20 to 3/23/20. Each basket as well as the S&amp;P 500 are indexed to 100 at the COVID Crash low. As shown, what had at one point been the most beaten-down names, have crushed it over the past two years; hypothetically having turned $100 into $481 having even held up well during the recent bout of weakness for equities. For comparison, the biggest winners in the early days of the pandemic bought at the lows would have only seen $100 turn into $137.64 while the S&amp;P 500 as a whole would have a little more than doubled.

&gt; # Jobless Claims at Lowest Level in Over 50 Years

&gt; Since early December, initial jobless claims have risen and remained above multi-decade lows. That is until this week. Seasonally adjusted claims fell for a second week in a row down to 187K this week. That is the lowest reading since claims came in at 182K all the way back in September 1969.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While not to take away from the historically strong reading as NSA claims also hit a new low for the pandemic of 181.1K, before seasonal adjustment, jobless claims have not exactly fallen to as significant of a low as the adjusted number. Although that is the lowest level for the current week of the year since 1969, there have been recent periods like the fall of 2018 and 2019 in which claims were even lower. Declines in initial claims have historically been common for the current week of the year, but the next couple of weeks have typically seen claims experience a brief bump before resuming a seasonal downtrend roughly through mid-spring.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims have fallen even more consistently with week-over-week improvements in 7 of the past 10 weeks. Now at 1.35 million, continuing claims are down to the lowest level since the first week of 1970.

Do I just take the gross wages on my W-2 and add my short term gains from stocks + crypto and multiply by my tax bracket, then subtract whatever I already paid in state + federal taxes on my W-2? 

For the long term gains on stocks/crypto is it safe to take out 15% and pay that plus the amount I owe above?

As for payment do I just pay the federal and state through [irs.gov/payments](https://irs.gov/payments) or is there a form I need to send them first?

solar,"Feedback on Quotes - Hudson Valley, NY","Got a few quotes from different solar installers and wanted to get some help on choosing between them or continuing to look for other installers. Many of the installers are saying there is huge demand because energy prices in NY have jumped significantly in the last few months. Prices seem decent but not great but I got 4 quotes from different installers and so I was trying to compare them overall including the quality of panels and inverters.

All the quotes provide the same savings which is $0.50/watt for NYSERDA which is a credit to the installer and comes off the top line price I listed. Then the 26% federal tax credit and the $5,000 cap for NY state tax credit come off as well which leads to the final price.

Quote 1: $33,880 for 8.8kW with 20 Sunpower M Series 440 &amp; Sunpower Inverter. Total cost after NYSERDA and tax incentives $16,815 which is $1.91/watt

Quote 2: $36,802 for 10.53kW with 26 REC 405 &amp; Enphase IQ8A micro inverters. Total cost after NYSERDA and tax incentives $18,337 which is $1.74/watt

Quote 3: $31,230 for 9.6kW with 24 QCell 400 &amp; SolarEdge Hub Inverter. Total cost after NYSERDA and tax incentives $14,558 which is $1.52/watt

Quote 4: $34,144 for 10.66kW  27 Tesla T395 &amp; Enphase IQ7+ micro inverters. Total cost after NYSERDA and tax incentives $16,323 which is $1.53/watt

From the research I have done I feel like quote 2 is the strongest because the REC panel seems good and is more compact so can maybe fit slightly more on my roof. Plus the IQ8A seems to be more future proof since it is the latest technology but I am not an expert.

cryptotrading,Interview with Outside General Counsel of an up and coming CyrptoMining Project in Seed Funding stage - Grow Mine Operation,"**Interview with Tom Osinski - Outside General Counsel for Grow Mine Operation (GMO)** 

As a retail investor myself it can be very challenging to do thorough research and actually talk to people who know the project team on the ground and in real life, particularly in this new emerging industry of Crypto Currency.  I recently had the pleasure of interviewing Tom Osinski, a lawyer in his own right who has been taken on as Outside General Counsel for Grow Mine Operation (GMO).  Tom has been practising law since 2003 and has a diverse set of experience that is well suited to his work with GMO.  I hope you enjoy this article as much as I enjoyed talking with Tom as I continue my quest to understand, research and unpack as much as I can about this project.  

Please find below the transcript from our interview:

**Hi Tom, Anthony the CEO and Founder of GMO introduced us and I understand you are the legal counsel for the GMO project.  Can you tell the readers a little bit about your background?**

*I'm a first generation college student from the Seattle area. Went to the University of Washington undergrad then Law School at UC Hastings in San Francisco.*

[Tom Osinski - Outside General Counsel GMO](https://preview.redd.it/mxzv8gijmmp81.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c82c361952a11d2e394bf7663b6f2944231ec265)

*I moved home after I graduated and decided to open my own practice focusing on civil litigation and business law. Quickly adding entertainment due to my passion for music and desire to help our local scene. By being my own boss from the start I was able to pursue the clients and areas of law that interested me. That is how I took to entrepreneurs and startups as well as cutting edge areas of the law where the landscape was unsure like the cannabis market. So in some ways being involved with start up crypto projects was probably inevitable.*

**Thank you for that, sounds like you are an entrepreneur at heart as well.  How did you get to know about GMO and what made you decide this was a project you would like to work with with respect to providing advice and legal services?**

*Yes I always say entrepreneurs are my people.*

*Anthony and I live in the same town, Tacoma (it's like Oakland to San Francisco.  Seattle's somewhat grittier sister city) and we have a mutual friend we both respect a lot. He referred Anthony to me because of knowing my background in Trademarks and Branding. (I have handled both the merchandising contracts and litigation around brands for several well known properties in Federal Courts around the country). This mutual friend, also an attorney named Jim Oliver is someone both Anthony and I have the utmost respect for as a solid and honest person. So when he recommended Anthony I was happy to take the meeting.*

*Once I learned of GMO and all it entailed from a business model perspective as well as the transparency and ethics I told Anthony I was interested in serving a more involved role and eventually became Outside General Counsel to be the guru on all things legal.*

*Honestly it's the best project I have seen since a celebrity fanclub type token project I worked on back in 2018. I mention that because that particular project let me work with some governmental affairs colleagues of mine (lobbyists) and take several meetings with congresspersons, their staff, and regulatory agencies in support of that project and get certain insights and assurances for a very new industry that is still making up the rules and regulations in real time.*

**Can you help us understand what sort of things a lawyer does with respect to an operation like GMO?  Many of us that are new to crypto are still trying to understand how the whole industry works, however, I understand GMO is like a normal startup business so I would imagine much of the work is inline with a normal business operation?**

*I have some basic roles that I would have with any business. Reviewing/negotiating/drafting contracts. Formation of entities. Registration of trademarks. Advising on employment, vendors, leases etc. Just like any other business. Because GMO is very ""real"" with brick and mortar locations, it's an incorporated entity with its own bank accounts and ability to enter contracts and hire people. And all other such things I do a lot for GMO I would do for any company from a pizza restaurant to a property developer.* 

*But I also help with things unique to crypto generally and with mining more specifically. Because I have to help GMO work out an effective and legal framework to operate the mining operations and how the resulting mined tokens are properly allocated to token holders and stakers so as to be sure GMO delivers on all of its promises.*

**Wow, this project certainly sounds like it is challenging the status quo.  Only have a few more quick questions, what advice would you have for retail investors when they are researching projects like GMO, for example, what sort of things should people research to make sure they have a good understanding of projects like GMO?  For me, one area that I have really liked about the project is the fact that the team is prepared to share who they are and their backgrounds.  From experience that is rare in these types of projects where most are shrouded with anonymity.**

*You have really hit the nail on the head. The first rule of this kind of project is know who you are doing business with. They should be disclosing legal names of the business and it's officers, state of incorporation, conventional addresses and other contact. Not just ones that live in cyberspace.* 

*For example GMO is a Washington state company. That means it is on record with the secretary of state where anyone can find out it's mailing address, governing people, and a registered agent where legal process can be served. It means GMO has to adhere to state and federal law here in the United States and is subject to both regulatory action and private civil suit. In short GMO is governed by the rule of law. If you can't physically find someone you can't hold them accountable. So the best course is to only deal with projects backed by people/entities that disclose who they are and how to find them. And wherever that is needs to be someplace that has an actual functioning legal and regulatory system. Without that you are at their mercy.*

*Then the second thing is to look for a track record. Once you have that identity at hand. Have the companies or the officers been involved in other projects. Have they had other problems. You of course have to take into account that social media allows for lots of falsehoods to circulate but you should still look into anyone you want to work with.*

*Sometimes no news is good news...and bad news needs context. But it's always smart to look.*

**Thank you, that is very helpful advice and certainly I am sure many readers will be glad to read.  Last question for you, in the interest of full disclosure, if people want to research you and your background, what is the best way for them to find out a bit more about you and your legal service?**

*It's simple. Google me. I'm out there. I always prefer that to directing anyone anywhere. But you will see things like my website and that it's so old I must have been around for a while..lol. plus linked in social media.. all with history proving I have been around. Plus they can look at things like the state bar to see I am licensed and in good standing etc too*

**Thank you for your time Tom and I look forward to learning more about GMO over the coming months and tracking their progress.**

Please note that this article is not intended to be financial advice or to suggest that you should invest your own money in this project, it is simply information at face value and like any investment the reader is strongly advised to do your own research (DYOR) into any opportunity.  

For full disclosure I have personally invested a small amount of my own money in the seed sale and was recently made a moderator in their Telegram group due to my willingness to help share the vision, however, I act as a volunteer in this capacity.

personalfinance,Will the IRS process my refund?,"I think I’ve found myself in a weird situation. I filed my original 2021 tax return in February, and got my federal refund almost immediately. However, there was a delay on my state refund. I checked the portal for my state, and it said that my return required further review. I then realized that I had a W-2 from the state that I forgot to file. It was from the beginning of 2021, and it was for $10 worth of income.

I wanted to wait to see if the state would process my return before filing an amended return, but we were nearing the tax deadline. So, I decided to file it anyways. I didn’t owe anything federal, but I owed $5 to the state (because the state ‘overpaid’ my tax return by that amount). I paid this via direct deposit, and figured that they’d eventually send me the original amount that I filed for.

The issue I’m facing is that now, the tax tracking portal isn’t recognizing my original return. It says that no return for that original amount has been filed under my social security number. I’m just wondering if my amended return replaced my original return, or if they will ever process that original amount that I filed for.",finance,1648257612.0
stocks,8 Reasons To Never Bet Against the US,"#Intro

I’m going to outline 8 reasons why I believe the US remains the best place in the world to invest. This will cover culture, future projections, economic sectors, and international relations. This is going to try to remain as factual as possible with all information sited. Each of these bullet points is going to be generally stating why the US markets have an advantage over other developed markets like Europe and Japan or an advantage over developing markets such as China and India. [This is the theory behind the strategy that I run]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialAnalysis/comments/ry1qq5/efficient_leveraged_portfolios/) and suggest to people to best take advantage of this market.

###More Investors
 * In the United States if you want to retire well off you need to be invested in all non-outlier cases. Some people chose real estate, but stocks are far more popular. About [5 percent of people own a second property]( https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/10/nations-stock-of-second-homes-2/) which I’m using as a rough proxy for how many people would be considered real estate investors. The point is that it’s a very low number. To contrast this between [52]( https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/25/more-than-half-of-u-s-households-have-some-investment-in-the-stock-market/) and [56]( https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx) percent of people are invested in the stock market. Social security exists as a safety net, but it will barely keep you out of poverty. In the 1980’s [60% of workers had a defined benefit pension. This is down to just 4% now.]( https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/pensions_basics.moneymag/index7.htm) This means that if a majority of people currently working want to retire comfortably, they need the market to do well. This is a bullish sign for the market for two main reasons. The first is that most of these people are adding a portion of their paycheck to various index funds every other week. These massive monetary inflows create a permanent upward pressure on the market. The second reason is less direct, but due to the scale of the incentive for the market to do well, laws, regulations, and interest rates are all going to be biased in favor of the market. This explains a reason why the US market should trend up, but why should it trend up faster than other markets? The answer is that the percentage of people who invest in other countries is far smaller. [15% of people in Germany, 17% of people in the Netherlands, 33% of people in the UK]( https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/pensions_basics.moneymag/index7.htm), and [only 7% of people in China]( https://www.thebalance.com/china-stock-market-shanghai-shenzhen-hong-kong-3305480#:~:text=Only%207%20percent%20of%20China's,swings%20in%20China's%20stock%20market.&amp;text=In%20China%2C%20less%20than%2020,is%20in%20the%20stock%20market.) hold stocks. This means the inflows to their markets are smaller and the incentive to favor the market in their national policies is weaker. This is only one of many factors that influence market movements.

###High Consumer Spending
 * In the United States people are incredibly fond of spending. It’s quite straightforward that a lot of spending means a lot of money flowing into businesses. These elevated cashflows directly lead to increased stock prices. Now of course not all companies only do business in their home country, but that’s where most of their revenue typically comes from. The way I decided to compare this with other countries spending is by looking at [household consumption as a percent of GDP]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/consumption_GDP/#:~:text=Household%20consumption%20is%20about%2060,over%2080%20percent%20of%20GDP.). The US is not at the top of the list, but it is significantly higher than most of its wealthy peers. 68% of US GDP comes from household consumption compared to 52% in Japan or 51% in the EU. You can also see the [sheer scale of US consumer spending when it’s displayed nominally]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/household_consumption_dollars/). The people of the US spend 7x as much as the people of Germany, even though the US only has a bit over 3x the people. 

###Low (Enough) Corruption
 * Despite all of the issues you see on the news about the US government and its politicians, it’s a relatively uncorrupted country. [While it scores far from the top on the control of corruption index]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_corruption/) the idea is that it’s more than good enough to invest in. The main point is that it ranks far above most major developing countries that could in theory outgrow the US markets in the next couple decades such as Brazil, India, and China. Despite these countries generally having higher annual GDP growth, their uncertainty and inconsistency when it comes to investing scares away a lot of potential money. This gives the US markets an advantage over most developing markets but doesn’t provide any advantage over Europe for this point. 

###Past Performance Indicates Future Performance
 * Everyone has heard that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but guarantee is the problem word there. Nothing in the market is guaranteed, but the past is still a fantastic indictor of what we can expect in the future, broadly speaking. US markets have grown at an average rate of 5-10% annually for many decades depending on what time frame you look at. This is not as true for other developed economies. Over the past 25 years the US [has returned 50% more on average annually]( http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/comparison/european-stocks-vs-us-stocks/) than a comparable portfolio of European stocks. The time frame is somewhat restrained by the data available in some emerging countries such as Brazil and India who both only got stable exchanges in the 1990’s. This is still far enough back to cover multiple business cycles and generally give an idea of expected returns. Over the same time frame [emerging markets returned a very similar amount]( http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/emerging-markets/) to their European counterparts. Of course the future could be very different, but past performance suggests that the US has the right combination of traits to be the most successful market and most of those traits likely remain. 

###Continued Population Growth
 * One of the biggest long run concerns of investors is that population growth is stagnating or even dropping in the most developed countries. The last hundred years of growth have been greatly assisted by an ever increasing population. Japan’s stock market is famously very flat. It remains [below it’s high that was achieved in the 1990s]( https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/stock-market). There are a variety of reasons for this but one of the major concerns with the country is that there population has appeared to peak and has been slowly trending down since 2010. Estimates project that they will fall from 126 million to 75 million by 2100. [The EU faces a similar issue]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20190710-1). They are projected to fall from 450 million to 416 million by 2100. This is where the US completely stands out from the rest of the developed world. The US is [projected to increase in population from 330 million to 430 million]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth) in this same time frame. This growth rate is on par with many developing countries and far ahead of ones like China and Brazil who are expected to shrink. I can’t state strongly enough how much of a comparative boost this will provide the US. I also want to point out that most of this growth is expected to come from immigration as our birth rates aren’t that much different than Europe. 

###Global Reserve Currency
 * The USD is what is known as the global reserve currency. Central banks around the world hold significant amounts of foreign currency for a variety of reasons. These include the ability to stabilize your own currency against another, facilitate international trade, and to provide protection in case of market shocks. It makes sense that other countries would hold something they think is stable, useful, and commonly accepted. The USD is this currency more often than not making up [59% of all foreign reserves]( https://blogs.imf.org/2021/05/05/us-dollar-share-of-global-foreign-exchange-reserves-drops-to-25-year-low/). It cannot be understated how powerful of an economic tool this is. We have just seen this in action when sanctions were placed on Russia. The US government [has frozen more than half a trillion in Russian reserves]( https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/us-sanctions-russia-central-bank.html). Another example of this being used was in 2020 when the US created trillions of new dollars. This increase in money supply was not only born by US citizens. It was absorbed globally due to the extensive currency reserves. Why does this give US markets an advantage? It provides the country as a whole with a powerful weapon that can be used to push the world into a more favorable position. It means the US can use QE to escape recession more effective than any other country, on paper at least. Lastly, it makes foreign trade incredibly easy. All of these are pieces that provide better economic conditions than their competitors can create. 

###Military Dominance
 * It’s no secret that the US spends a lot on its military. The scale is sometimes lost on people though because there’s a huge difference between being the biggest, and [being larger than the next nine combined]( https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-military-spending-vs-other-top-countries/). This military dominance is tremendously beneficial to the overall health of the economy for a couple of reasons. The first is that it provides an incredibly safe place to do business. People are hesitant about doing business in a country that has even a tiny threat of being invaded. An example that’s frequently talked about on Reddit is the possible risk of investing in Taiwan due to its proximity and scale compared to China. The US has both an ocean and the worlds largest military separating it from any hostile powers. Notice how even though Germany wasn’t attacked by Russia last month, there was still [substantial fear]( https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/stock-market) in their financial markets, though a large portion of this was related to energy fears - another issue the US outperforms in. People might mention that nuclear weapons could reach the US from just about anywhere, but I consider that a non-point. The minute nukes start flying the minute your money doesn’t mean anything anymore. There’s also an economic side to the military that can be broken into two parts. The first is that that 800 billion dollar budget needs to be spent somewhere and that somewhere is in the US economy. In the latest budget [a staggering 130 billion is allocated to research and development]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/white-house-to-seek-813-3-billion-national-security-budget), as an example. A secondary economic factor is that this military power allows the US to provide the same protection it provides itself to its allies. Groups like NATO have a “common defense clause” that basically say if you attack any member you have attacked all of the members. So even though a country like Iceland [doesn’t have a military]( https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_162083.htm#:~:text=Iceland%20is%20the%20only%20Ally,the%20Alliance%20until%20the%201990s.) it is still quite safe from invasion because no one wants to go to war with the rest of the pact. Having these safe allies provides both a great place to do business, which leads to economics and trade growth. 

###Key Industry Dominance
 * Lastly, the US has economic dominance in two of the world’s most crucial industries, energy and technology. The US [is the world’s largest oil producer]( https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=709&amp;t=6) which drastically reduces their reliance on hostile foreign governments. This doesn’t mean that the country is immune to changes in the global price of oil, but it does offer comparative lower prices [than most of their developed competitors]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/gasoline_prices/). It also provides some security if the world enters into a depression or becomes more fractured. On a more abstract note, the US is also the [global leader in technological development]( https://info.kpmg.us/news-perspectives/technology-innovation/us-extends-tech-innovation-leadership.html#:~:text=China%20is%20close%20behind%20but,Silicon%20Valley%20are%20rising%20fast.&amp;text=More%20than%20a%20third%20of,2018%20global%20technology%20innovation%20survey.). Technology is the backbone of the economy and being one step ahead of the rest of the world is an incredible advantage. A huge number of the worlds most advanced projects and highest potential innovations are being done by US based tech companies and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. While China is ranked #2 and gaining ground, this is not as significant as it may seem. China is not investor friendly and is unlikely to change that. Investor money is still going to flow to the US for the foreseeable future. 

#Conclusion

This has been a **BULL** case for the united states. There are currently no intentions to write a bear case as most of the points are simply going to be the inverse of the ones stated here. The goal of this post is to highlight why I believe the US, despite the last decade of massive growth, is still the worlds best place to invest and will remain so for the foreseeable future. If you want to refute one of the points please, I beg you, back up what you say with reputable sources. One thing I want to note is that just because a company is US based, that doesn’t mean those companies have a strictly US based revenue stream. Most of the massive companies that drive the market’s growth are international. If the US goes into a deep recession, most of the world will also likely go into a deep recession. There are benefits to diversification but adding more to a portfolio does not always make it better!

#TLDR
The US’s excess growth compared to other developed countries is not an anomaly. The US is highly unlikely to follow in the footsteps of countries like Japan. There are numerous factors that drove our growth that still exist and will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.",finance,1648258133.0
personalfinance,Should I transfer internally to a new position? Only 1 year at the company.,"I work as a ""data analyst"" and currently finished one year at the company. Basically I create SQL queries for others. Nothing really complex, mostly basic queries, which limits my lack of learning to experimenting and self-learning.

I do have a decent amount of downtime which I like and I'm not very busy, except for the last week of the month. Where I sometimes work 10hour days.

During my 1 year time I spent about 5 months working with a senior analyst on a major project, he had made an internal transfer to a new department that has started up within the company. 

Now he has put in a good word for me to his current boss and previous boss (who knows of the work i've done), who are both looking to hire for a Senior Analyst.

Usually I've heard it takes 2-3years to get senior rank, I would've had it at my old job if the pandemic didnt happen to bring my old company to a halt and I had to start over in a new field but similar line of work, however, I digress...

The current team is great, but not learning much about the new field i'm in since we are remote and everyone is busy and never had a real training session, just a few pdfs. We also had a team member leave about a month ago. So are a bit short staffed at the moment. Last we have not made much progress in applicants. We sent out 2 offers and it was turned down.

I already have introductory meetings setup next with the 2 bosses who are offering senior roles, thanks to my colleague. 


**My questions are:**

Is it wise to make a move an internal move so early into my career? 

After the introductory meeting and moving forward I will have to apply internally and my current boss would be notified. One of the jobs is in the same sector. 

What % raise should I ask for if offered the position? 10%, 20%, 30% etc. I currently make 85k which was a 25% pay raise from my previous job. 

Any other advice would be appreciated.

personalfinance,First MA state return: can I use my carryover losses?,"I moved to MA in 2021, and for some reason TurboTax is not automatically grabbing my carryover losses from the federal return to use in the MA return.

personalfinance,How to Best Save for Future Home,"Hi, long time lurker, first time caller.

The advice here has been imperative to getting us to where we currently are so it only makes sense to ask for more help moving forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are trying to best set up our long term goal of buying or building a future home of approximately 750k - 1 million in value. We are guessing 250k to 350k MINIMUM would be best in cash to put down to make payment reasonable with our projected future income. So some hard truth would be great for us.

To reach that cost goal, I'm assuming that a mutual fund/something that gives compounding interest would be best since our timeline is around \~10 years. My current thought is to contribute \~500$ into the mutual fund every month in hopes of 7% returns over 10 years, liquidate stocks, and roll future home sale into the next home. I just don't know if I'm over simplifying the situation and we should be more hardcore/less hopeful. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you on any feedback.

personalfinance,is there any repercussions to a company for not taking out federal income tax?,"Like the title says, and this is purely out of curiosity because I feel it's our own fault for not catching it.

Story:
My wife worked for a company for about 9 months but left due to a lot of issues (a very new healthcare company going through a lot of growing pains) , they switched payroll systems during her last 4 months there. During that last 4 months they took out state taxes, social security, but no federal income taxes. Her w4 was correct. We didn't catch it until tax time. We contacted the company and got a ""sorry that happened"" and found out they have already switched payroll companies again. Is there any repercussions for this? I know we should have combed the pay stubs better. I'm honestly not surprised considering all the headaches she went through while working there.

personalfinance,Split your retirement between Roth and Traditional,"Some advice for working people: split your retirement savings. Put half in a Roth IRA or Roth 401k (if your employer offers it). Put the other half in a traditional IRA or 401k. Of course, make sure you are putting at least enough in your 401k to get your full employer match. 

The reason for splitting your savings is that it protects you some against future changes to the tax code. Also... your Roth money will not be taxed when you withdraw it.  Your traditional money will be, however since it will only be around half of your income, your effective tax rate will be much lower. People with income below $50k pay very little in federal income tax.  The standard deduction for married filing jointly is $25k. So by putting SOME of your money in a traditional retirement account, you can pay no tax when you put it in and little to no tax when you withdraw it.",finance,1648266784.0

Bitcoin,I Took 1 Whole Coin off the Market: My One Week Journey Dealing w/ the Bank Just to Buy a Bitcoin.,"Hey guys. Ive been into BTC for nearly 2 years now. The longer time carries on, the farther down the rabbit hole I go.

Typically, I have been DCA'ing every pay day up until a week ago. I have always thrown whatever extra change and money I have laying around into it. I no longer buy stocks as it always feels too much like a gamble. I can never just be happy holding stocks. It was like chasing a high finding the next 'money maker.' The banks must have loved me and all the stupid fee's Id pay buying and selling as I carry on the chase.

But then Bitcoin entered my life. And life became easier. Stocks became meaningless. A Maxi I became. No more stocks. Savings being placed entirely into the soundest money of all time: Bitcoin.

Fast forward to January. My father has a fatal, and extremely rare stroke; a Cerebellar Stroke. You would never have seen it coming. Not your typical stroke symptoms. 2 weeks later after a battle in ICU he passed. He didn't leave much. He was a free spirit. Retired early, and lived and travelled in a van. My step-mom, who he divorced a decade ago, kept paying his life insurance that he neglected to pay.

So with many thanks to my step-mother, I received inheritance.

First thing I did, I paid off debts. Helped the wife pay down a lot of debt. Upgraded the house.... slightly. Nothing too major.

Im keeping a bit of fiat in savings. Sadly, letting it get eaten away from inflation.

The rest, I dedicated to buying up the remainder of what I need of a whole BTC. Total cost roughly, $35,000 USD.

Enter: The Royal Bank of Canada. Canada's biggest bank. A bank of which I have been with for many a year. I have savings accounts with them. I have a larger LOC with them. I used to use their investment services.

Banks are not your friends. I am aware of this.

But, honestly, its 2022. The banking system is stuck in the 1980's.

This past Monday, March 21st, I went to the bank to wire the $35K to NDAX, a leading Canadian Crypto Exchange (0.2% buy fee, $15 transfer out fee). Did the paperwork, confirmed the info, and boom, done. Later, the advisor from the bank called to ask me some questions from the Anti-Money Laundering department. Cool, a couple verification questions. I answered honestly. Advisor said ""great, expect to receive the wire tomorrow.""

Tuesday, nothing received. This is a domestic wire transfer. Should take a day, tops.

Wednesday, March 23rd, Im in the bank again. Branch manager tells me the wire was flagged as ""too risky."" You cannot imagine the disbelief in me. The bank was deeming what I was doing with my money as ""too risky."" As if they had some control over what I choose to do with my money. Its sad enough its 2022, and there isn't an easier way to send $35K, which honestly isn't even that much damn money in todays age.

After raising a stink, and showing the branch manager my Bitcoin tattoo, I informed him I was ""WELL AWARE OF THE RISKS."" I also had to mention that its risky leaving my savings in a bank that has a less than 1% interest rate in their savings accounts. I was asked to show proof that I have dealt with NDAX before. I was asked if anyone told me Id make a fortune buying BTC? Standard money-laundering questions. Check-Check-Check. Passed the test, AGAIN.

Manager put a word in with Wire Transfer department, and the money was finally taken from my account.

Thursday rolls around now. Still, nothing. Nothing at all. Money, stuck in limbo somewhere. In some sort of electronic bank cloud.

Today. Friday. Guess where I am again for a 3rd time? The fucking bank. More times in 1 week than in 2 years. Remember everyone... its 2022. Nope, sorry, I cannot call them because when it comes to wires I have to physically enter the branch I sent the wire from.

This time I get branch manager involved, a co-manager involved, and of course an advisor. All looking into this shit for me. Im livid. Its Friday. The original wire was supposed to be sent Monday. Tomorrow is a weekend. WTF?!?

Turns out, under money-laundering investigation, AGAIN. More questions asked. Anyone put you up to this? Have you used NDAX before? How did you hear about them? Are you going to do business with them again? Blah blah blah. I passed again. I was told then to await an email or a phone call when this has all been settled. 2 hours pass. I email the branch manager, livid. Nothing still.

Then, around 3PM, I was told the money was released.

Guess I have to wait the weekend to receive it on Monday. Those fuckers at the bank!

But no! As soon as NDAX received it into their processing, I received the wire transfer! 530PM Pacific time! Last minute.

Of course everyone will say 'HEY! DCA that shit!"" I get it. I DCA'd for so long that it was just nice to cop what I needed and throw it into Cold Storage. The few dollars Id save DCA'ing mean nothing to me in 10 years. Its nice to just have a solid 1/21,000,000, and to take it off the market.

But that's not the total point of this at all. We need to all be happy for each other for any amount of BTC we have at any cost we got it. This is the future. This is the sound choice.

The point is this tho:

Banks are not your friends. Banks consider you GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT when wiring any sort of money.

And this my friends.... is why we Bitcoin.

His IRA: $13k

529 Plan for our 5 year old son: $7500


I also was granted $100k in stock last year in my company (7 year vesting schedule). The stock paid about $20k in dividends last year (in addition to the salary listed above).

Our mortgage is $1900 per mo and we have been throwing an extra $350 per month toward it, but going forward we are going to put that in a brokerage account instead (we only have a 2.5% interest rate).

I had only been doing 6% 401k, but upped it to 10% at the start of the year. I get a 4% match, husband has no plan through work. When my son goes to kindergarten in August and frees up that $1300/month preschool cashflow, we will funnel that into my 401k to bring my contributions up (will contribute about $15k this year but will be set up to max out next year).

Every month we do:
$500 to husband IRA
$500 to 529 plan

This year my plan is as follows:

Up 401k in September

Sell crypto soon (we are even)… too volatile… put it in a brokerage acct

Take each quarterly dividend check and send half to savings ($2500 per quarter should help cover the taxes and add about $4000 to our emergency funds since we owed $6k more in taxes for 2021.) Invest the other half into a brokerage account (approx. $10k) in index funds. This assumes dividends are equal to last year but might go up.

Divert $350 per mo from mortgage into  brokerage.

Wait until the end of the year to ensure we still earn little enough to make a Roth IRA contributions, then do that if possible (we are approaching the bubble with dividends and stock grants).

Do you think we should just focus on building our emergency reserves instead of investing? Currently shy of 4 mo expenses (it got whittled down bc in the last two years we paid off student loans and owed 6k in taxes). We could also just sell some/all of the crypto at even and funnel it back to savings.

Anyway, we got home and I attempted to put the ear drops in while he was busy eating his treats. As soon as I touched his ear, he wiggled out of my arms and then wouldn’t come near me. My partner tried and he did the same but this time he tried to bite the eardrops. We stopped because we were obviously getting no where and we didn’t want to frighten him more. We’re going to start from scratch for the next couple of days and just treat him while touching his ears and then try to move slowly to putting the drops in once he’s comfortable again. 
My biggest concerns are
1: if we wait a couple days will his ears get worse? I obviously don’t want him to be in pain but also can’t force the drops in.
2. I’m really worried about his experience at the vet and if he’ll remember the scare he had. I worked really hard at getting him to be comfortable and calm at the vet and I feel like today really stuffed that up.
Any advice on how to get him comfortable with the drops again and especially about how to get him comfortable at the vet!

Bitcoin,People do not understand the power of scarcity,"Those market swings seem so out of place in my opinion. There are a lot of people like me who are just constantly buying and never selling. People who will only start selling if they can make a massive move up with their lifes (or not selling at all). I'm thankful for the current prices (not counting in current upswing), but at the same time it perplexes me a bit. IMHO you cannot tie actual ""classic predictions"" to bitcoin, as long as there are players like me (growing in numbers) who just always buy and do not intent to sell short term or during bears. No other asset in the world has legit number-go-up tech literally built in and there are a ton if reasons why bitcoin will not be dethroned imho.

- First crypto
- All the necessary fudamentals that hard money needs
- Fairest distribution out of all coins (also the right people got rich with it, not VC)
- Strong POW network
- Best possible approach for trilemma as far as we know today.
- High decentralization
- Fixed supply

No other crypto will ever be able to compete with bitcoin's hashrate. That only could happen if bitcoin experienced a major fundamental flaw.

With my current understanding of bitcoin, this all feels like a free ticket to get wealthy and it dazzles me how all of my friends are trading this asset back and forth. Maybe the real issue is time preference.

personalfinance,How to Safely Exit Capital Vacations Club,"2 years ago, my wife and I bought into a Capital Vacations ""membership"".  It wasn't a smooth buy in and what we thought we could afford soon quickly became a major burden for her and I.  After the initial buy in we took out a debt consolidation loan and another personal loan to drop the interest rates on it.  I have had to pay almost $15k myself, but we are still in for well over $500 a month for next decade at least ($45000 15yr note).  I'm already covering all the family expenses with my job, and she is taking care of the rest of it.  With her stubborn-ness that she agreed to take care of this is causing her to work 2 jobs + extra shifts + medical donations to cover it.  

With all this working she is doing, we have had found it difficult for use to have any ""us"" time and she is starting to fall out of our relationship and at a fast pace.  So the question is, how can we safely offload this burden without having to default on the loans (I can't have a default due to my job requirements).  If we do split, it would probably get switched over to her name and I'm worried that would do to her future, so she would have to exit is anyways.",finance,1648296565.0
Bitcoin,It is a revolutionary act to buy Bitcoin and hold your own keys.,"In today's fiat world we see problems around us almost every day. Wake up one day and there are Black Lives Matter protests in many major cities after several incidences of police violence. Maybe you wake up the next and see trucks rolling down your local highway protesting fuel prices, or covid passports. Both have happened in the past two years, and both are representative of one big idea: an oppressive government.

Pick your social issue and it doesn't take very long to see where the governments have caused market or societal distortions. A big social issue I've spent my lifes work on is ecology, food systems, and trying to build a better natural ecosystem for us to live in. At every turn I see misaligned fiat incentives preventing me from doing the work I know needs to happen. This post isn't going to be about the massive land use issues, and food system problems I have identified. However, it further drives home my point of these misaligned incentives.

Over the past 50-100 years the West has decided to prioritize the centralization of power in the name of efficiency. Bitcoin, as a distributed system, breaks this down and puts the power back into the hands of the people. One of the biggest principles in an ecological system is resilience, or the ability to take a hit and bounce back from that disturbance. Bitcoin has taken many of these hits, and come back stronger than it was before..just study the history of the past 13 years. 

Choosing Bitcoin is a revolutionary act, like the Sons of Liberty tossing tea into Boston Harbor in 1773. It is a clear message to the decision makers and stakeholders that we the people are fed up with their decisions and we are going to do something about it. 

We aren't choosing violence, and we aren't choosing a war - we are choosing to vote with our economic value to support the alternative system. I want to be very clear that revolutionary acts like this will not be met without force from the decision makers and stakeholders of the current broken system. Vis a vis KYC and AML regulations over self custodied wallets, central bank digital currencies, ESG mandates, and further expansion of unregulated (and frankly unnecessary) derivatives markets.

I think I have finally come to realize that owning Bitcoin is a revolutionary act. It has taken me over four years to see this for what it is. Keeping stacking sats, not your keys not your coins.",cryptocurrency,1648301999.0

I live in Virginia for reference. I bought my home 2 years ago with less than 20% down, so I had to have Private Mortgage Insurance. Home values have continued to rise dramatically since then and, if my property's market value is close to estimates, I am close to being able to remove PMI. However, to do that I would have to get my property re-appraised. 

I am trying to understand if private appraisals are fed into the state/county tax system which would obviously increase my property tax bill.

stocks,Is it really true that labor market is such a strong that anyone can get hired?,"So the Fed keeps saying the labor market is strong that interest rate hike is justified. 

However, my story says very differently, and so does what r/jobs says, where you will see so many employers baiting and switching. 

Sure, compared to when I first was looking into jobs in 2016, it seems like the job market gets better, but is it really strong enough that employers are paying upend price to hire someone? 

# My experience 

My job application stats in last 3 months , pretty much all pharma tickers that many people trade would know such as PFE/TMO/LLY/JNJ/ABBV/ABT. Applied 30+ jobs

I have 5 years of experience/MS STEM degree/basic computer programming skills (Python/R+/Excel), but can't seem to find jobs.

Just finished 3rd round of interview a week ago, 1st HR screen interview, 2nd hiring manager 1:1 interview over the virtual meeting (cuz the location is at the other side of the coast) and 3rd panel interviews. 

During 3rd panel interviews, it was 3 hours interviews, including a quick presentation of my previous projects and lunch time, all of which are about to judge me as a potential employee and a colleague, indicating how much selective they are. I dont like it from the begining to the end. 

And per glassdoor, this position pays around 95K as a base pay in the location. 

Common, all I am looking for is just W2 wage for 70-80K base pay (in midwest standard) with work life balance, if that's not too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Fed's evaluation and rate hike

Part of reason here is to vent about this distorted job markets, but primary reason to share is to see if this what's called ""Strong job market"" is able to support Fed's rate hike in the next course of the months, if not years, without causing recessions? 

Fed might say that due to great resignation and population change (Boomers retiring and more workforce is needed), the labor market clearly favors employees, but I am not sure if that will actually support the economy in the long run. Great resignation people who might have benefited in 2021's bull run are running almost out of their profits. 

Current index level is about May 2021, and many still are uncertain if recent 2 weeks' market run-up is only the beginning of the bear markets or will start to recover. So those great resignation folks might have to come back to workforce when Index crashed another 10-15%. 

Then when it come to population change, corporates wont simply hire a new employee just because the employee is leaving. Sure, when department manager complains and bring it to the issue to upper management, it might, but corporate America is all about squeezing employees out like slaves, and return the money back to share holders, so if they find out the department can run without the retired employees, then they wont simply hire (I am currently working in one of the tickers that I have shared, but have seen this case so often that there is no replacement for the leaving employees, and the left over is on current employees). 

So how does this mean strong labor market will continue? 

Understandably, it can really differ depending on which sectors and regions, for instance, one of my family members just got into JPM as investor consultant, and the starting point was 150K in NYC, which would be almost same as 70-80K in my area when it comes to buying powers per nerd wallet living cost calculator. 

Also yes, if I want to work in MCD flipping burgers or in WMT/COST just loading some boxes, sure I can be hired within 30 minutes, but do we really call this as strong job markets? In other words, 15$ per hour job is available everywhere, but do we really call it a job? It's just part time gig that is only used as a stepping stone to move to next chapter of life. 

Then when it comes to actual jobs that have potential career ladders, this kind of jobs are highly selective such as what I went through, and with technologies developing, the demand for workforce will be likely discontinued.  

# Big Question: Okay, so what? What's the outcome? 

Perhaps, no one knows the outcome including any Fed members, but I still believe that deflationary pressure are at full force when it comes to labor markets and inflationary pressure are at full force when it comes to raw materials due to deglobalization of the current political climate.

To me it sounds like exactly stagflation, where no one can make money, but who knows? The chance is I will be most likely wrong, and I hope I am wrong on this.",finance,1648306560.0

personalfinance,Buy new house or wait. Can I afford it? Europe,"Hello!

My family wants to move to a better area, better house. I live in Europe, but I think the basics are the same. I would love some advice and views about the situation and finances. Thank you!

We are 39 and 38 with two children: 7 and 4. I am a computer engineer in public sector, but I am considering about changing jobs because salaries in my sector are crazy high; my wife’s job is teacher in a private school. We live in an island in Spain. Island space is quite scarce and expensive. Moreover, it is a very popular touristic and retirement place for North Europe people. I am giving all this background to context the situation for non europeans out there.

I make 36k€ and my wife makes about 26k€, both afer taxes, social security, government retirement payments, … We have about 80k€ in savings, and we can save like 2000 per month. There is some risk about current jobs mid term (2-3 years).

I have a 150k€ flat in a centric area and it is rented. It is quite old and in an old building. It gives me 536€ per month and I pay 350 per month (mortage+ taxes and insurance). 45k€ mortgage. 0% interest rate (variable, it will probably increase).

We currently live in a 150 sq meters (1500 sq feet) attached house in the same centric area. Market price can be like 250k€. It can be developed into a 4 stories building, so I think it is a good investment long term. We pay about 750€ per month (mortgage plus taxes and insurance and utilities). 150k€ mortgage. Like 0.5% interest rate (variable, it will probably increase). It can be rented for 950€ per month.

We have a 10k€ debt we want to finish, it has a 3. 7% interest and we pay 600€ per month. No more debts in credit cards or car loans.

The house we are looking at is a detached house with garden in a beautiful zone, it will cost about 400k€. Mortgage will be about 1.5% fixed interest. I can borrow up to 70k€ from my parents to buy it. Buying taxes are like 8% selling price. Downpay would be between 20 and 10%. My math say mortgage will be like 1000 € and taxes+insurance about 250 per month.

personalfinance,Should I wait to put money in CD?,"I'm really bad at saving/investing money. My money has been sitting in checking/low-interest saving accounts for a long time.

personalfinance,Need some perspective: retirement funds and a tax nightmare,"Hi Reddit, coming to you hat in hand with an embarrassing question that I wish I didn't have to ask (hence the throwaway).

I'm somewhat new to personal finance, I don’t know all the pro-tips, but financial security is one of my biggest priorities in life. I prioritize retirement, I started contributing to a 401k as soon as I got my first full-time job and have steadily increased the contributions I make year over year. I would never do anything to jeopardize my retirement funds - I know that over time, if I prioritize contributing, it’ll be a huge asset when I’m ready to retire. 

Now here comes the hard part. I was laid off from the company I worked at for nine years at the beginning of the pandemic (it was a tough time for the business, and they let 20% of the company go). I got back on my feet immediately with contracting work, so had a steady paycheck coming in. I made it my priority to figure out how to continue to contribute to retirement in lieu of having a corporate retirement benefit like a 401k. So, I opened up a Charles Schwab account, as I researched and discovered they have rollover and other IRA options. I put the money from my former Principal retirement account into the rollover account, and set up a call with a financial advisor at Charles Schwab. I told him my financial goals, the first of which being to keep my retirement account invested and steadily earning over time. I took extensive notes so that I can refer back to our conversations when I need to. His advice is to keep a chunk of my retirement funds in the rollover IRA and put the rest into an account powered by Schwab Intelligent Portfolios – its robo advisor.

So I spent a lot of time on the Charles Schwab website, figuring out how to set this up. I get the Charles Schwab Individual Intelligent Portfolio Account up, funded, and running in July 2020. Fast forward to now and it's tax season. I am going through TurboTax and as I’m entering my financials, I’m seeing that I owe a whole lot more in the Federal bucket than makes sense to me. I dig in, and realize that the Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolio account I signed up for, and put a good chunk of change from my rollover IRA is actually a \*brokerage account.\* Therefore, to the government, it looks like I’ve taken my retirement money out of an IRA prematurely, and am now getting hit with a penalty.

Well. I’m completely ashamed, embarrassed, and angry at this mistake. I would never do anything to jeopardize my retirement funds. I tried really hard to do the right thing for myself during self-employment to continue funding my future retirement, and trusted the guidance I got from this financial advisor. My notes line up with the actions I took, so even in looking back, I can tell I was diligently following advice from a trusted financial source. I’m lucky that I’m in a position where the penalty isn’t going to break me, but is there any way I can get around this fee? There’s no way I would have jeopardized my retirement funds – I want to keep them tucked away, invested safely and earning over time. I feel like I just wasn’t asking the right questions and following up enough. So, asking for some help. Is there anything I can do to rectify this?  
(I'll be revisiting the thread at a few hour intervals as I'm running around like crazy today) Thank you all for your advice and thoughts. Financial health shouldn't be confusing and hard. I want to make it better for myself and the people around me.",finance,1648317086.0

personalfinance,Unique rent-to-own situation. Completely priced out of market for other rentals and owning. Need advice.,"We've been living in a rental house for 3 years now. It was a diamond in the rough situation, $2150 before covid hit. After covid, we are completely priced out of other rental houses, even most apartments, and houses/condos to buy in this town and the surrounding towns. Last week, our landlord informed us that they had a strong desire to sell the property as they live too-far to manage it anymore. They have other properties, but this is the farthest.

They offered to sell it to us, privately, for $390k. Other houses in the neighborhood have been selling for $380k (rough shape) to $430k for comparable size. We can afford to live here with that price. Other houses &lt;$500k in the area are all equal size, but in more urban parts of the city. 

Rent in the area for similar homes is &gt;$3200/month. Houses with comparable sq footage and features are &gt;$500k. Without moving somewhere &gt;2 hours away, we are kind of in a hard spot. I think our landlord is cutting us a break since they could easily get at least $425-440k for this house based on what has sold in the area.

This wouldn't be a forever home. We'd likely live here for 5 years and move on, depending on my salary increases and when my wife goes back to full time (we have a 6 month old baby). The kitchen and bathroom need cosmetic upgrades and likely new appliances at some point. We'd also likely try to paint and put new light fixtures in the half-finished basement to increase value. All in all we'd probably put another $15-20k to make it updated. It already has a new furnace and AC when they knocked out last year.

So my question is, before mortgage rates shoot up, should we consider buying? There really isn't anything comparable in the city or adjacent towns. We are just terrified of waiting for higher interest rates, but also scared of a possible bubble and losing our investment.

solar,Inverter AC Outlet Control,"I have been tossing around the idea of using a few solar panels to power an oil-filled space heater or baseboard in my basement during the winter months to make it more comfortable and help offset a little bit of natural gas usage in my forced air system. Additionally, I may swap this out for a dehumidifier in the warmer months, but we will see. The power consumption for the heater is still TBD, but assume the panel array and inverter will be sized appropriately and will include a buffer for start-up surge.

It seems pretty straightforward. The piece I am unsure of is how and when the outlets become hot and cold on the inverter. I'm sure this varies by inverter, but I'm having a hard time correctly phrasing a Google search to find an answer myself so I'm hoping someone here could point me in the right direction. Do the outlets immediately become hot once enough DC input is fed via the solar panels? Does it wait until there is enough DC input to satisfy the peak rated AC output load? Is it safe to have a heater just instantly flip on when the outlet becomes hot and off when the panels stop producing enough (sun sets, storms, etc)? Or is there an additional controller or other piece of equipment that would be used somewhere in the chain to safely facilitate the start up and shut down for connected devices?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been staving off default for I think 3 months now. I've not been a lucky guy with things and my plans have crumbled more than once thanks to events outside my control. I have been paying humongous monthly bills for over 15 years now with virtually nothing to show for it, of course thats the trap but yeah my balances are basically what they were 10 yrs ago. My credit is completely screwed at this point with multiple 90-days-past dings now, and I can't pay double-$800 bills to catch back up on top of rent and everything else.

I'm not looking for monday morning quarterbacking here about the merits of college, career paths or my incredible ability to negate hard work with laughable luck and terrible decision making, etc... I'm looking for advice moving forward regarding the consequences of default. I can't get out of my loans with bankruptcy but at this point I've given up on the idea of a house or kids or any kind of normal life because I'll just never get ahead of this, so I'm kind of feeling like I've got nothing to lose anyway. So what happens if I just default on everything? I guess they could maybe garnish my wages but they're already getting everything anyway so if they do, I guess nothing changes for me... but will they actually? This is what I'm not sure on, I don't know what the true consequences are. If its just that my credit is jacked up for another decade, well... its already totally fubar'd so that doesn't seem like much deterrent from finally being able to breathe financially for the 1st time in ever. I'd like to just commit financial suicide and get it over with so I can reincarnate and try again already.

Maybe I need to just pack up and head for a country where my credit/debt wont follow me, idk, desperate times call for desperate measures.",finance,1648335309.0

personalfinance,Advice needed on what to do with my property after divorce,"Hello, so I'm going through a divorce with my spouse. We originally purchased the home in a booming housing market (Boise, ID) and got a great interest rate (3.1%). The house appraised for 405k, we currently have a mortgage out for 375k. We almost immediately started a complete renovation on the home and we're doing so out of pocket because we could afford to with my spouses second income funding the renovation. We grossed 180k last year together with me making about 74k before taxes. 

 Fast forward a few months and my spouse has moved out and lives back with her parents. She no longer has the secondary income and we are both filing for divorce. She now makes about 55k. I have student loans to pay back (70k) and we both have mutual debits (20k) that I'm hoping to have paid off once i sell my pickup and engagement ring.

I'm currently spending about 2k per month on the mortgage and I'm essentially living paycheck to paycheck in a house that is 60% remodeled. My remodel is at a stand still as we determine what to do with the house. 

I would like to keep it in my name but I would be expecting to have to pay out my spouse. I fear that if we have to sell it, it would be for a loss due to it being in the middle of a remodel. I can't really finish the house quickly due to my finances being tight in preparation to sell. Our market has apparently grown 10-17% this year.

Consumer sentiment has dipped below 60 three times before: 1980, 2008-2009, and 2011. These historical events were a recession from the Volcker rate hikes, another recession after the Great Financial Crisis, and fears shortly afterwards when the credit rating of the US federal government was downgraded by Moody's.

From the University of Michigan: ""When asked to explain changes in their finances in their own words, more consumers mentioned reduced living standards due to rising inflation than any other time except during the two worst recessions in the past fifty years: from March 1979 to April 1981, and from May to October 2008. Moreover, 32% of all consumers expected their overall financial position to worsen in the year ahead, the highest recorded level since the surveys started in the mid-1940s. The combination of rising prices and less positive income expectations meant that half of all households anticipated declines in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead.""",finance,1648343373.0

personalfinance,Seeking advice on acquiring a property from my parents,"Background: I am 27 years old, young professional making ~$70k/year in a HCOL area. I have a joint mortgage with two other people on a townhome and we all live there together. Long story short my finances are in good shape. 

My parents purchased the home I grew up in for ~$100k back in 1999 or so. My parents soon divorced and from what I understand my mom has had to refinance the house twice for various reasons including doing a loan remodification to lower the monthly payments. Apparently she wasn’t able to afford the mortgage while she raised my two sisters and I since my dad was dodging child support. The current value of the property according to Zillow is around $390k. My mom owes $247.5k on the property at 2% interest rate(!), but hasn’t paid the mortgage in ~4 years for reasons I do not understand. 

Current situation: My mom is currently working with the lender and attorneys to remodify the loan again. I am working with her to file a quit claim deed to remove both of my parents from the deed and put the property and mortgage under my name. My dad’s financial situation is grave and he basically wants out so he can try to qualify for government assistance or something (I don’t know the exact details, we don’t really talk anymore). 

My mom doesn’t want to get rid of the house. I’ve really tried to convince her to either rent it or sell it as the market is hot right now but she doesn’t budge. I obviously want my mom to have a roof over her head which is why I’m working with her to put everything in my name. I think my mom is really bad with money, and every time I talk to her about this she just brushes me off and says that life’s always been this way for her and she’ll get through it. I’m afraid she might lose the house if she keeps up this way. 

I am writing here to get some input on how this is going to affect me financially, aside from the obvious increase in my debt-to-income ratio and being on the hook if my mom somehow can’t pay. I really want to buy more property soon (within five years) and I don’t want to do anything to jeopardize that plan, though I’m willing to extend that timeline a bit because I do have the potential to earn passive income from the property I currently own. I also want to read some other perspectives from people who may have been through a similar situation and see if I can get a plan of attack that results in everybody winning.

investing,Rising Interest Rates And The Coming DeFi Implosion,"It's quite well known that crypto has been propped up by things like stable coins and DeFi; both things meant to keep people HODL-ing so that outflows are kept to a minimum. This helps keep coin values artificially high by keeping fund flows stable.

This is a lot easier to do when credit is loose and the cost of debt is very cheap. However, we have now entered a time where interest rates are expected to rise and central banks are looking to tighten the money supply.

A big part of the DeFi ""boom"" has been speculators trading in their real currency (Dollars, Euros, Yen, RMB, etc.) into coins (BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc.). Then when they want to exit one of those coin speculations, they trade their coin into something that is supposed to represent a store of value; stable coins. The money stays in the system because it is converted from one crypto to another; rather than a real currency.

Regardless of whether a crypto speculation is a stable coin or not stable coin (e.g. - BTC), people can ""stake"" it. The idea of ""staking"" is that you lend your coin to another party for a period of time for a set return. This return is oftentimes a multiple of the underlying coin (BTC, ETH, Tether, etc.) but is sometimes converted back into a real currency (Dollars, Euros, etc.) before paying off the ""interest"" on that contract. 

We could get into more depth about specifics and intricacies of these agreements and speculations, but that isn't really the premise of this post. Nor is it material to the issue at hand. Rates are about to rise, liquidity is going to be removed, and there will be significant pressure on DeFi / crypto returns.

Everyone saw that mortgage interest rates rose about a half a percent last week after the Fed recently announced that they would be increasing rates. This is a substantial move in rates and foreshadows the coming risks for crypto.

This is because as rates rise, you'll see more and more people (institutions) move from risky cryptos to safer investment vehicles like treasuries and other bond type investments. From their perspective the incremental return vs the risk becomes less and less compelling as interest rates rise.

As they move their money from DeFi contracts to safer investments, the price of cryptos will fall as money leaves the system. As the price of cryptos fall, the demand for margin debt from DeFi will fall as well. This decreased demand will cause the ""interest rates"" that they pay on these DeFi contracts to fall as well. So a person who used to get ""6% annualized"" on their BTC, will now get something closer to 5%. And combined with the fact that cryptos will fall in price while treasuries are paying more in interest, we'll see this momentum only grow as rates continue to rise. (One thing to think about is whether you believe governments will bail out coins that want to operate outside the control of governments. I say they won't, but crazier things have happened.)

Obviously, there could be more to say about this and I'm sure I'll get a lot of posts debating these observations. Some will say that I don't understand everything there is to know about the crypto world; which is true. Some will disagree with my assumptions; and to me that is probably more reasonable. 

But I will say that not describing everything about what is going on in crypto doesn't make the observation incorrect. Because, in the final analysis, there are only a couple of things that matter with these Ponzi's. Liquidity, leverage, the cost of debt, and a Peter Pan level belief.

Please share your thoughts. 

I would love to hear what others think.",finance,1648347074.0
CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA+ Experiment - Week 23 Update,"It’s that time of the week again and it’s another positive update for my experiment.

For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi) as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the community to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my own research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some DD. I have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous posts and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be chosen by the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end of the experiment. For the starting point you can look here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tk8d59/one\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment\_week\_22\_midweek/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tk8d59/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_22_midweek/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

It’s mostly a good update again this week as we’re seeing multiple weeks of slight gains now. Honestly March has been surprisingly good for both the crypto market and the stock market. I was nervous that we would see some downward pressure as the FED raised rates this month and who knows what the market is going to do in response to the situation in Ukraine, but amazingly March has been good. Now, if St. Peters wins the NCAA tournament, then anything can happen. (Go Peacocks!)

At any rate, you’re not here to listen to me go on about the situation in the world or the NCAA basketball tournament. If you’ve bothered to read this far it’s because you’re curious about how my DCA experiment is going. So without further ado, the financials:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uopx32gc7up81.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8679153dbb202a093bc91fd837118be830a4fc14

Those of you who tune in regularly know that just a few weeks ago I was regularly posting updates about a project that was down over 20% and often the only coin that was even close to positive was LUNA. Now as the end of March approaches, the overall project is down just over 8%, I’ve got several projects sitting right on the edge of profitability and the big guys, BTC and ETH are down just over 2% and just under 6% respectively. Honestly, looking at the market and the broader macro trends just 3 or 4 weeks ago I wouldn’t have expected to be at this point today.

The one mild disappointment for this particular update is TRAC. I don’t know what was going on with that project but it had a major pump earlier in the week and as of my mid-week update on Tuesday it was actually up for the first time after having been the worst performing project in the entire experiment for several months. It’s dropped somewhat, although considering where it had been previously, somewhere in the middle of the pack doesn’t look so bad. I did decide to do my numbers as week over week numbers (ignoring the mid-week case), so it still looks good because as of last week’s update it was down pretty big.

Including TRAC, all but 2 of the coins in the bottom half of the portfolio had double digit week over week gains, driving the overall growth this past week. FTM currently sits in last place, I think because of the bad news that Andre Cronje and Anton Nell are leaving. I suspect FTM will recover as I don't think the project is doomed, although the lead developers leaving any program is bound to make an impact.

I guess if you follow traditional investing, now is the time to be fearful because everything is looking good. Who knows what next week will bring, but it’s hard to feel negative sentiment when the market is working in your favor like it has been the last couple of weeks.

Here’s the updated trend lines for each of the projects. I kept the mid-week update in the trend lines as well, so you can see the wild journey that TRAC in particular has been on this past week.

What I'm really happy about looking at the chart is how much the overall portfolio is beating the price of BTC change over time. Bitcoin's price is down over 27% since I started the experiment, yet the experiment is down just over 8%.

One other item that I like to look at is how I’m doing thanks to the DCA approach. Overall it is paying off quite well in what has been a mostly down market since the experiment started. If we start to have a significant bull run over the next few months, the benefit of DCA will fade, but in this down market it’s been quite a blessing.

Next week will mark week 24 of the project and I’ll reach the point where I’ve but $200 into each of the projects I’m working on. Here's what I purchased in the past week and what I'll be purchasing next week:

Currently my wife (24f) and I (24m) live in a very low CoL area in a home we purchased in august of 2021 that costs us just under $1k a month, pulling in around $125k joint annually and have $40k in student loans that are comfortably paid. No other debt. 

Still waiting on a start date, but I was lucky enough to land a new job that will put me very close to six figures alone and our total income at about $150k. Unfortunately the job means we will need to relocate to a different state. Cost of living is similar outside of housing which will jump to about $1300-1500 since we are choosing to rent. 

I was curious if anyone had insight on renting or selling our current home, assuming both are feasible. I’ve checked my loan documents and renting seems to be allowed (still need to confirm with lender) and we are leaning this way due to our low interest rate (under 3%). We can definitely rent it out at mortgage+property manager, but aren’t sure how much will actually be skimmed off the top (whatever did would probably go back towards future repairs). On the flip side, we think we can sell for about $30k more than we paid and the new company would cover closing costs as a part of relocation.

personalfinance,Mortgage Downpayment Advice,"My wife and I just sold our house and are in the process of buying a new one. Between the house sale proceeds and our previous savings during the pandemic, we have $150,000 in liquid in our bank accounts. We have ~90K in students loans and would like to put 50K of the 150K towards that whenever payments and interest start back up. (Save 40K of loans due to lower interest rates on the remaining ones and in case Biden forgives anything in the next 2-6 years.)

We are debating if we should put 5, 15, or 20% down. I definitely want to keep at least 20K in savings for an emergency fund, but would rather have at least 30K for that. So that basically leaves me with 70-80K to put towards the downpayment and closing costs, if I want to do that much. (I'm still not sure if investing or something else might be better than paying less interest and PMI.) We make 10K a month and have bought half as much house as we can theoretically afford. 

This is what I am thinking currently:

With 5% down, we can have plenty of money to spend on the house's potential needs. (It's nice, but it is a 40's home.) And we can maybe invest a lot of that money and try to beat out the 4% interest rate.

With 20% down, we have a much smaller mortgage payment, no wasted PMI money, and much less interest. But it cuts deeply into our savings.

With 15%, we get most of the 20% benefits but can pay off the other 5% later so we don't use too much of our savings. Our mortgage broker is saying we can pay the PMI off upfront for about 1K, but I think, if this is really a thing, we could pay the PMI monthly and get to the 20% quickly and call them so they stop charging the PMI.

It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual  
A step-by-step booklet for you to get  
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back

I've been in Crypto before 2017 and these are the lessons I learned so you don't have to make the same mistakes.

&gt;Rule Number Uno, never let no one know  
How much dough you hold cause you know  
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially  
If that man f\*cked up, get yo' ass stuck up

1.Never share how much Crypto you own because that will make you a target for scammers &amp; hackers

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Number 2, never let 'em know your next move  
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?  
Take it from your highness  
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips

2. Don't give Crypto advice to others, stay low key.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy  
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up  
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck  
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up

3. Don't listen to public figures and price predictions.  
They have selfish intentions, DYOR

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Number 4, I know you heard this before

personalfinance,Buy this home or wait? Details below,"I have the option to buy a $325k home without having to go into a bidding war (albeit the listed home price is already inflated as similar homes in the area are currently being listed for around $275k-$300k but with the bidding war and all, it probably isn’t too far off) at the current mortgage rate or possibly rent for around $1200 and invest the difference in my 3 fund lazy portfolio. 
With the interest rates already close to 5%, I’m skeptical that the housing market would appreciate at this rate over the next 30 years, and then we have maintenance and property taxes which should also be factored into the total cost of ownership. The only thing going for that home is that it’s in a location that I desire as I rent next door.  If I turn down that offer, I will have to move away from that neighborhood after my current lease ends as my rent will go up another 30% (already up 10% from the beginning of this year) from summer. However, if I rent elsewhere, I could still have the flexibility to hopefully move back into the area some time later.
I’m definitely going to miss the location, the memories and experiences over the last several years I lived there as I’m so emotionally attached with this neighborhood.

PS. I had the option to buy a 1000 sft home with 3 bed, 1.5 bath for $220k at 3.11% which I turned down late last year as the price felt inflated at the time and also because I was hoping to find one with a second full bath. That home went for $235k and later was sold again for $275k in less than 3 months. I will forever regret that decision but now this other home that is being offered to me is a 1250 sft home with 3 bed and 1.5 bath. I just want to curl into a ball and cry as I’m afraid passing on this offer would price me out of this neighborhood forever.

stocks,"Russian stock market, crushed by war, opens with big limits","Russian stock market, crushed by war, opens with big limits

1:11 AM ET, 03/24/2022 - Associated Press

NEW YORK (AP) — The Russian stock market opened Thursday for limited trading under heavy restrictions for the first time since Moscow invaded Ukraine, coming almost a month after prices plunged and the market was shut down as a way to insulate the economy.

Trading of a limited number of stocks, including energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, took place under curbs meant to prevent a repeat of the massive selloff on Feb. 24 that came in anticipation of Western economic sanctions.

The significant restrictions on trading Thursday underlined Russia's economic isolation and the pressure on the financial system despite central bank efforts to curb market plunges. Foreigners could not sell stocks, and traders were barred from short selling — or betting prices will fall — while the government has said it will spend $10 billion on shares in coming months, a move that should support prices.

The benchmark MOEX index gained 4.4% as some companies partially recovered losses from the plunge on the day of the invasion. Airline Aeroflot bucked the positive trend by losing 16.4% — not a surprise after the U.S., European Union and others banned Russian planes from their airspaces.

Russian stocks were only a small part of emerging market share indexes even before the war and only for those with a high risk tolerance, given extensive cronyism, nontransparent accounting and widespread state interference. They lost any attraction for most foreign investors when the Moscow Exchange was dubbed “uninvestable” about a week into the war.

“The stock market is really almost a sideshow at this point,” said Chris Weafer, CEO at Macro-Advisory Ltd., a consulting firm. “It’s more a sentiment indicator because obviously companies are not raising any money on the stock market, and they won’t be able to.”

He said, however, that state-owned banks or funds may have been buying to support prices: “It does look like state-supported buying rather than any genuine interest on the part of investors.”

Government efforts to stabilize stocks and the ruble that has plunged in value are a way to show that some confidence was returning and “to try to get that message across to people not to panic, that this is a temporary situation that will improve,” Weafer said. Nonetheless, he added, the Russian financial system remained in a “fragile” state.

Tim Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said reopened trading was “deeply managed” and suggested that “for those Russians with some spare cash, there is nothing much else to buy as hedge to inflation and currency collapse.”

Restrictions like shutting down and restricting the stock market are among those that Russia has taken to shore up the financial system against utter collapse, but they also close off the economy to trade and investment that could fuel growth.

Some foreign hedge funds have expressed interest in shopping for distressed assets — viable companies trading at knocked-down prices — but they have no way to take part because of the trading restrictions, Weafer said.

A U.S. official called the severely restricted trading a “charade.”

“This is not a real market and not a sustainable model, which only underscores Russia’s isolation from the global financial system,” Daleep Singh, a deputy national security and economic adviser to President Joe Biden, said in a statement.

The economic turmoil in Russia from sanctions and the war has been severe. Hundreds of U.S., European and Japanese companies have pulled out of Russia. There have been bank runs and panic buying of sugar and other staples. The exchange rate of Russia’s ruble has tumbled.

Outside Russia, the reopening of stock trading on the Moscow Exchange has little impact, including on the vast majority of U.S. investors’ portfolios, said Leanna Devinney with Fidelity Investments.

The exchange's market capitalization — about $773 billion at the end of last year, according to the World Federation of Exchanges — is a fraction of that of major Western or Asian markets. In comparison, the total of all equities on the New York Stock Exchange is roughly $28 trillion.

Russia's central bank estimates that retail investors owned roughly 7.7 trillion rubles of stock, equal to $79 billion, as of late 2021.

Stocks last traded in Moscow on Feb. 25, a day after the MOEX sank 33% after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Russia restarted trading in ruble-denominated government bonds earlier this week.

Roughly a week into the conflict, Russia was removed from emerging markets indexes compiled by MSCI after it determined the market to be “uninvestable.”

The London Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of 27 companies with links to Russia on March 3, including some of the biggest in energy and finance. The shares lost most of their value before that: Rosneft dropped from $7.91 on Feb. 16 to 60 cents on March 2. Sberbank plunged from $14.90 to 5 cents.",finance,1648397353.0

personalfinance,"Major home repair, little equity, decent income, looking to find the best way to pay this off.","So I am currently going through a major home repair. Terracotta sewer line. Anyone who has ever dealt with this knows how expensive it can be. I'm currently at $37,000 on the sewer, and figured we should do the 80 year old water service while everything is exposed to save money in the long run. Total expenses are $47,000 provided the current plan can work, another $10,000 if it doesn't (high likelihood it will work, but planning for if it doesn't).             

I have $40,000 in savings due to expected home repairs I need to do. But it's not enough. I'm single, my take home pay is $1900 every two weeks, mortgage of $1050 a month. I bought 1.5 years ago with a VA loan, no money down. Loan balance is $173,000 and my house appraised for $185,000 in August 2020. Not a lot of equity. Might be worth at max $200,000 with the housing market being the way it is. No car payments. Just the usual utilities, food, car insurance, etc extra.           

Regardless of the route I go, I can afford this. But I'm trying to do this in the best way to keep things low as possible. I'd prefer to keep $10,000 in savings as my safety net, because I have no other safety net. I'm the top earner in my family. Personal loans have way to high of an interest for my liking (7.5-14% APR on average from what I'm seeing). I have a credit score above 800, and my credit card through my credit union has a variable interest rate of 11-13%.             
           
Would it make sense to get a home equity loan for maybe at most 1/4 of this expense? Secured savings loan? Pay $30k out of pocket and just get a personal loan to make up the difference? Really kind of lost on the best method with minimal hassle, as IDK if paying for an appraisal is worth it for so little of a loan. I can probably get the best rate on any loan I get, and would multiple loan accounts open hurt me? I also probably have $2000 coming in from my tax return here as soon as I file (yeah, I procrastinate). I can probably put $500-$750 per month towards extra expenses, I'm just coming up short in the near term.

personalfinance,Refinance Student Loans: Real Interest vs Nominal Interest?,"Hello,

So was looking into refinancing my federal student loans into a private loan last month and I was approved for 3 different scenarios. I am trying to decide if it's better to have higher monthly payments and get the loan paid down faster or to have lower monthly payments and let inflation devalue the loan a bit.

Here's my confusion: Say I have a fixed interest rate of 3% for 10 years and let's say inflation is 2% per year. Does that mean I am technically only paying 1% per year in interest?

I was approved for similar terms to these 3 scenarios:

1. 100,000 @ 3% for 10 years = $115,873 over the life of the loan $966/month
2. 100,000 @ 3.25% for 15 years = $126,480 over the life of the loan $703/month
3. 100,000 @ 3.55% for 20 years = $139,808 over the life of the loan $583/month

If I chose option 1 I'd be done paying it in 10 years and will have paid the least amount of money but I'll be paying 966 per month.

If I chose option 3 I'll only have to pay 583 per month but it will take an extra 10 years to pay it off and an extra 40k. This sounds terrible in my opinion.

But if my understanding of real interest rates and nominal interest rates is correct, and that 3.55% in option 3 is technically 2 percent lower, in terms of the present value of the dollar vs the future inflated dollar 20 years from now, would I have only paid $116,364 of today's money?

(For that number I just put a 20 year $100,000 loan @ 1.55% into a student loan repayment calculator)

Over the years my wages have gone up and my wife just started working at my employer which tripled her annual income, so we think we are finally in a place to fix up the house. We would just sell and move but we love the location and given the current market there are no houses available.

Problems are that I feel like we need to move quick since interest rates are going up but I cannot begin repairs for a few months because my step son and his gf are currently living with us while they are searching for a place and we don't have enough room to do the work and dont want the extra stress.

We have 800+ credit and qualified for 150k at 5.24% for 30y home equity loan through discover. Is it a bad idea to take it out now to try to lock in a lower interest rate knowing I won't use it for a few months?

The work needs done, both my neighbors pipes have burst and been replace in the last decade and we currently are not at all happy with master (if you can call it that) suite and kitchen.

The short: Are we dumb to take out $150k 30y loan @ 5.24% for work on our home we plan on doing in the future? We aren't happy with our home the way it is so basically the options we have come down too is take out a loan to get the house where we like it or sell it as is and buy a newer house in a less desirable location, although new houses are very hard to find right now.

I can afford to pay it out of pocket but it would mean more significant sacrifices in addition to moving to a higher COL for the program. 

Does it make more sense to take on loans in order to make the present financial burden easier?

They would be unsubsidized federal loans. Fixed rate of 5.28%.

I know it sounds like a personal quality of life choose but I’m curious how much more I will really be paying. The program(2 years) is a industry change for me, so it’s not like I’ll get an immediate direct pay bump as a result of an MBA or some in industry degree.

BTC has finally broken out past it's $45k sell wall briefly moving past $46k indicating that larger gains over the coming week may be quite likely. 

Ethereum climbed up past $3.2k with its next resistance around $3.5k.

The US FED has promised to lower their monthly purchases of stocks and bonds, and is also starting to increase interest rates back from it's long 0% rate during the pandemic. This should put some downpressure on most stocks now that it isn't effectively ""free"" to continue to borrow massive amounts of money.

Obviously there's still a lot of uncertainty in the global markets with the war in Ukraine, but I don't see crypto taking any worse of a blow due to fear than regular stock and ETF options.

stocks,How likely is it for stocks to suffer hard if fed interest rates rise significantly this year?,"If interest rates go up that means people will probably put their money into bonds or banks right? Does that mean it should be obvious to us that it won't be a strong market?

Based on recent history this definitely seems to be the case. They had an aggressive rate hike recently (2019) and it started to hurt the market. Then the market suffered during covid but the fed was miraculously able to save the market by taking alot of action. The question is can the stock market survive the feds tapering and the rise of interest rates? 

 The word tapering itself is very fitting. Tapering is a term that is also used to describe people who are trying to slowly come off drug addiction. There's good amount of evidence to suggest that the market is addicted to the feds support. You only have to look at the ridiculous rise in stock prices from just before COVID to now. For example Tesla went from 150$ in February 2020 to a ridiculous 1000 this week. It just doesn't make sense that something could rise that much during a crisis.  Amd went from 45$ to 120$ during the same time frame. The sp500 went up about 25% and the dow 18%. The  Vanguard Total Stock Market Index is an accumulation of every us stocks price into one index. It went from 78$- 112$ per share within the same time frame. That might not seem like much but it's about 35-40 percent rise. 

Another thing to consider is that the fed might believe that some degree of this inflation is transitory. This could lead to a less aggressive rate hike which could be good for stocks. The problem with that assumption is that many analysts have been predicting 5-6 rate hikes which would be about 2-2.5 percent.",finance,1648424668.0

A background, I grew up poor. My financial background includes a half semester of a personal finance course in high school which mainly included a round of dave ramsey. Im 26 now, I have a nice home with a low monthly payment and low interest rate, 3 way older vehicles that are entirely paid for, and a decent paying job in my field and about to interview for another job that will increase my income around 45%-50% if it goes in my favor. 

Regardless of how the interview goes, Id like to know how to better make my money work for me. I have a decent savings built up that Ive been keeping as my emergency fund, thats probably a bit excessive. Its making minimal interest in my savings and I think theres more that I could do with it besides letting it sit.

My grandparents home is currently in a reverse mortgage, and the lender has the home in pre-foreclosure for non-occupancy despite the fact that my grandparent has been living there. We are in a boat of a likely costly legal battle to prove occupancy, or purchasing the home out of the mortgage; which was the plan in the longer term anyways. My parents cannot purchase the house as my father has been out of work for the last several months and would likely not be approved for a second mortgage due to the change in income. The house is massively under appraised as the reverse mortgage was initiated in the recession, and the current balance due is approximately 200k. The house is appraised for mid-250's, but in the current market comparables in the area have been selling in the 350k+ range. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am graduating in December with a Bachelors and Masters in a STEM field. I have a FICO score of 760 with 4 years of credit history and about 22k in federal student loans with no other debt. I have earned over 20k each year for the past several years due to internships and part time work. I have an internship for the summer lined up for $37 dollars an hour, however that will not start until May. I currently have about 10k in savings as well as several thousand in other assets I can liquidate.

  
I am looking at FHA loans and am curious if anyone has similar experience qualifying as a student. I know I can make the payments no problem. If it is worthwhile to apply should I apply now or wait until I have pay stubs from my summer internship?

CryptoCurrency,GnosisAMA,"Many of you may recall Reddit MOON tokens and xMOONs on xDAI (now Gnosis Chain) as a way to swap onto the Ethereum Mainnet. We're excited to tell you how Gnosis Chain is continuing to prioritize the same usability and experimentation that xMOONs demonstrated. We're happy to join you today for a r/Cryptocurrency AMA!

### GnosisDAO builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem.

In November 2021, the xDAI and GnosisDAO communities voted to combine their vibrant ecosystems to create the Gnosis Chain: An Ethereum forerunner-companion that addresses scaling issues through solid engineering. Gnosis Chain is the associated execution-layer EVM chain for stable transactions. It uses the xDai token and includes a wide-ranging group of projects and users.

The Gnosis mission has always been centered on experimentation and building decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem. When Gnosis was founded in 2015, it focused on building prediction markets to enable worldwide access to accurate information. While creating the prediction market platform, it became clear that Gnosis needed to build the infrastructure required to support it. Gnosis Safe, for example, was born of necessity.

As a DAO, Gnosis uses the products that it creates to transparently guide decisions on the development, support, and governance of its ecosystem.

Gnosis Safe (multisig and programmable account), Cow Protocol (formerly CowSwap and Gnosis Protocol), Conditional Tokens (prediction markets), Gnosis Auction, and Zodiac (standard and tooling for composable DAOs) are all products incubated by Gnosis. Their success can be attributed to the recent spin-out of Cow Protocol and the formation of SafeDAO. By combining needs-driven development with deep technical expertise, Gnosis has built the decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem.",cryptocurrency,1648443455.0
stocks,I'm starting to move to Cash,"Everyone that says Cash is Trash, obviously doesn't count their stock gains in US dollars.  Inflation maybe closer to 10% than 2%, but that doesn't mean cash isn't useful.  I could for example buy a years supply of food today cheaper than tomorrow.  I could pay off my 3% car loan today and save 3% over paying tomorrow.  Yes, after inflation a 3% loan seems like a good deal over 10% inflation.  But the question you need to ask yourself is where would you put that cash?  Stocks are clearly going thru a dead cat bounce and will go lower after the next interest rate hikes. Dividend stocks give you a bit of insurance, but most divy stocks pay a lower dividend cash flow than inflation.  Non divy stocks require the greater fool to pay more tomorrow than you did today to make a profit.  But with a higher interest rate to get a loan asset prices will begin to fall. The US dollar is debt, and once debt is paid off or destroyed the money supply decreases.  The Fed has decided to crash the economy and stock market to slow inflation.

I started trading options around September and shortly after made about $1500 from a $100 contract because of $LCID. Since then, I have lost all of it, plus another $700 of my own money I put in. During February to March I really made a lot of improvement in day trading, but never managed to repeat the same gains, staying very stagnant for a while. Recently, I lost $230 because of a wifi problem causing TOS to lag while trading during my 3rd period class when I was playing QQQ puts on FOMC. It literally told me my orders never got filled and That I had canceled them, so I just continued my school day, then returned to the think or swim app at home to see three positions down 98%. I think about losses every day and it angers me every time. Now, I can't even look at a chart without getting pissed off, and when my friends ask me about how it's going, I get clowned by them because they're making money on this big bounce back in the market with shares and crypto. I really liked trading before, but I haven't had a loss like this in a while, but I know deep down I want to get back into it. I've taken about a 1 and half week break mostly because of school, but also because if I saw another red trade on my account I'd blow my brains out. I know $2200 isn't a lot, but it is at my age. 
Also, if any of you have tips, I'd like to say I was pretty good at finding trades, but just really bad at executing and got anxious when P/L up or down a little bit, so maybe something that accommodates to those strengths and weaknesses.

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14).

Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

I'm 20 years old (almost 21), and I am considering buying a car. I started working when I was 18, and I have been saving ever since. These recent rises in gas prices have really been making me think of an electric car. I talked to my family about this, and nobody has told me it was a bad idea. Reading some of the posts on here is giving me the thought it could be a bad idea though.

My original plan when I was 18 was to save enough for a 20% down-payment on a house by the time I graduate with my bachelor's. With house prices only rising, and me needing to get my Master's instead, I'm reconsidering. I'm thinking of an electric car, around $45,000.

It's a lot, but my reasoning behind it is: it's electric, so that means no gas price fluctuations, and very little maintenance costs. The idea is that I have money saved up, and I pay VERY little in bills right now (about $600 a month, with gas being $300 of it), so I should buy this now and have a new and reliable car for when I go off on my own (my current truck has 138k miles on it,) for at least quite a long while. Once I pay off the car early, I will be able to just straight save for a house down-payment, which will hopefully be a lot less in 5 years, this will also end with me cutting off gas expenses, which are a large portion of my bills right now.

**Now for Financials**.

My credit score is 762, I have 1 credit line with a history of 2 years and 8 months. (I opened it when I was 18)

I plan to put a $25,000 - $30,000 down-payment.

With sales tax and all fees, I'm predicting to have the total price to be around $50,000, which means a loan of $20,000

I want to get the loan for 60 months, no higher to pay less interest.

I haven't shopped around for interest rates yet, but I predict around 3% to 7%, maybe less if I get a cosigner. Not sure who I would get to cosign with me though. My dad has great credit and he trusts me to pay on time (I've never missed a payment), but he hasn't had a loan in decades so we don't know if him cosigning would do much.

Now the big problem: I earn $14/hour at 26 hours/week. That jumps to 40 in June and July, thus my income is about 18k a year.

From what I've read, this is too much car to buy for what I'm making. This is what I  don't understand though, if I make even just $1200 a month, with $300 (I may even be able to lower it to $205 if necessary) in bills a month. Is adding a $350 monthly payment (predicted with 3.5% interest and $30k down), with $40 in electricity (to charge), and about $200 insurance payment (predicted from quote), equaling to $590 a month (plus other bills making it $890) really that bad? I still have money left over at the end of the month to cover misc expenses, or fuck around with the money, or more likely, save it.

This is not to mention that when I graduate (in a little over 2 years) and get a job in my field, my income should nearly triple (Accounting Auditor). Thus I will be able to pay off the loan much earlier with little bills still, and go straight into saving a load of money.

My parents said it wasn't a bad idea, they plan to support me for UP to 7 more years (but I will definitely leave earlier than that lol). My dad pointed out that by doing this now, I will not have to pay a car loan at the same time as a mortgage, which is quite hard at the beginning to get used to, so it will be easier for me in the future.

It will be a new car, I understand new cars are a horrible financial decision, as I'm learning accounting, but with the market having used cars costing maybe even more than new cars, it seems like a stellar deal at the moment.

What kind of interest rate should I be happy with given my situation? Is this a terrible idea? Would you say I have a decent chance of getting a good pre-approved auto loan with my good financials stats, despite my low income?

**EDIT**

 Thank you reddit, I am not going to be buying a new car. I'm gonna run my current truck into the ground, so it should last me at least another 100,000 miles if I take good care of it. Just gotta work on my habits for caring for a vehicle, and suck up that gas sucks right now, but is not permanent. My next car will be an EV for sure, but that's years from now.

I'll likely invest 10k in I-bonds with the CPI rate, keep $5k in my savings for emergencies, and I'm still trying to figure out what to do with the other 15k. I'm thinking 10k in an index fund, and 5k as higher risk stock market money? While saving for retirement sounds great, my big purchases are coming in about 3-5 years, so I need to find something that can produce reasonable investments in that time frame.

I will continue to save though like I have been, and reach my goal of $40k by my bachelor's like I wanted when I was 18. What I will do with the new saving money, as I'm earning it? I'm not sure. I'm thinking put it into the index fund, but again, that's thinking for 30 years from now. Once I reach $40k, I'll probably continue to save until I feel ready to buy a home. I just don't want the money to sit in my account losing value.

Are there any shorter term investments I can look into that can give reasonable returns in 3-5 years?",finance,1648448523.0
CryptoCurrency,Crypto Tax in Germany - general question about 'earning',"Crypto noob here searching for enlightenment regarding crypto taxes.

I'm currently holding my cryptos on Binance and I've used the 'earn' option for a day or two, until I turned that option off and just let my portfolio stay as it is.

Now, the German Federal Central Tax Office states the following:

*You won't pay tax on crypto gains:*

- *If you sell your crypto after owning it for 1 year or more.*

- *If the total profits from your crypto are less than 600€ per annum.*

- *If you sell crypto that was used in staking after 10 year of having bought it.*


*You'll only pay tax, as 'other income' on crypto gains:*

- *If you sell crypto in the same year you bought it and realise a profit over 600€.*

- *If you sell crypto used in staking which earnt interest AND you do so within 10 years from purchase.*

- *When you're mining, staking or otherwise earning an income from crypto.*

If I understood it correctly, 'earning' is relatively the same as 'staking' on binance. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I was planning to hold crypto for a couple of years before I sell it, but since I've used the 'earn' option on Binance in the past, does that mean that I have to wait 10 whole years until I can sell my crypto without paying taxes for it, despite the fact that I've used the 'earn' option only for a day or two in the past and don't use it at all anymore? Or does that mean that you can continuously use the 'earn' option for 10 years, before you can sell your earned crypto without paying taxes for it?

In other words- did I unintentionally f*ck up my plans?",cryptocurrency,1648451776.0

personalfinance,How are mortgage points ever worth it?,"Closing on a house soon and need to decide whether to buy mortgage points.  It works out that a $6100 cost would save about $84 in monthly payments, which is a ~6 year break-even time.  After that point, all the internet guides say ""I'd be making money"".

This makes no sense to me.  At the break-even point I effectively have a 0% rate of return on my investment.  Six years is not a *neutral* point, I'm still deeply in the hole compared to otherwise investing the money.  (And if I were to sell the house before then, my RoR would be very negative!)

Ok, but mortgage points are a bet that you're staying in the house a long time, right?  Let's treat this like the long-term investment it is and calculate the rate of return as a function of time.  It's actually very easy:

    RoR = ln((yearly savings * years) / cost) / years  = ln(84 * 12 * years / 6100) / years

We can [plot this](https://i.imgur.com/sSh10RE.png) to see what happens to the RoR over time.  We see that the rate starts very negative and rapidly increases, peaking around 15 years at about 6.1%.  It then slowly declines down to 5.3% at the 30 year mark.

Even if I time everything *perfectly*, 6.1% is a pretty terrible long-term return, and it only goes down from there if the timing isn't great.  The stock market historically is 10%, especially when you're giving yourself a 15 year window to average over.  For 15 years, you're losing out on exp(15 * 0.1)/exp(15 * 0.061) = 1.8x in returns.  Obviously even worse for 30 years (3.2x).

What am I missing here?  Why would anyone ever buy mortgage points?  Please tell me I feel like I'm taking crazy pills that these things even exist.  (And this is even ignoring the possibility that mortgage interest rates go down any time in the next 30 years and you can effectively get points for free!!)",finance,1648453741.0

defi,"[Discussion] Investment strategy: ""HODL / Staking / DeFi farm"" vs ""Buy Low, Sell High""","Hello,

I am posting this topic, since I am debating between two strategies for my portfolio (BTC/ETH).

I have currently developed a ""fairly good"" technical analysis tracking strategy and I can see it fit well with the past 48 hours. It basically boils down to few indicators which determine ""peak prices"" and ""bottom prices"" with quite good confidence (at least so do I think, lol).

Here is some simulation data which highlights the outcome of both strategies for 2021:

[Simulation: HODL vs DeFi farm \(\~18&amp;#37; APY\) vs \\""Sell high, buy Low\\"". Market: 2021, BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/hulktse924q81.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=305433b43372e130d54188664417f5f334e06de8)

I will try to list the Pros and Cons of both, but I would like to get feedback from other seasoned investors in the subreddit (about their experiences):

# HODL with DeFi Interest/Staking:

**➕Pros:**

\- Secure return (paid in coins), together with profits from any price increase on the asset itself. My simulation is done with +18% APY return (simulating some of the best DeFi strategies you can possibly do).

\- Low to almost no risk: Neither the principal, or the interest are in danger (theoretically, I know...)

\- No chart tracking, news following or constant ""panic mode"" when to buy/sell. You simply can do DCA and add on top of what you already have.

**➖Cons:**

\- Lower returns

\- Asset locking (1-3 months): You can't withdraw or sell the locked assets even if a new all-time-high occurs

# ""Buy Low, Sell High"":

**➕Pros:**

\- More profitable: Mathematically (at least for 1 year intervals), it is more profitable to sell your coins at peaks (for a ""stable"" coin like USDT) and re-buy the bottoms

\- Short term inflation is not an issue: Inflation adjustment: Mathematically (again), it's still quite way more profitable to do so (even when I apply -10% inflation adjustment to the final sum). *Simulation ran with: 2 times sell at 60k, and re-buy at 45k during 2021 bull/bear markets, see data at the bottom.*

\- Your assets are not locked: You can move or cash them out freely at any moment (though, you are NOT supposed to do it, remember you are waiting to sell/buy it).

**➖Cons:**

*- Higher risk*: The rumors of ""possible big financial crash in 2022"" might just come true (as the world is really going crazy apparently lately), thus triggering at least 1-2 years of a ""real global bear market"", during which you will have to HODL on your ""dear"" USDT ""profits"" (I am not planning to cash out, as I am waiting to re-buy, apparently""

*- USDT risk:* USDT might just collapse, rendering all our coins simply worthless

\- *Long-term inflation risk:* If a longer bear market occurs (6-12+ months as in 2018-2019, when the 2017 ICO bubble blew), remember that inflation will eat your USDT while waiting with your ""profits"", while bitcoin is pretty much unaffected (and at least you would continue to earn interest in coin with DeFi).

# Request for opinions:

1. Has anyone succeeded long-term with ""Buy Low, Sell High"" (selling major All-Time-High points and rebuying the dips)? If so, with what part of your portfolio you do it (10-30-100%?).
2. If you side with the ""HODL/Staking"" strategy, what are your arguments against ""leaving all that money"" on the table? If so, please elaborate (with personal experiences/math) beyond simply ""it's less risky"".

Thank you all for sharing your thoughts!

* ***Dollar Cost Averaging:*** *I have not mentioned DCA here, because based on my calculations DCA is really good for ""traditional markets"" with lower volatility (see* [*this great post*](https://np.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/)*), however with the high volatility of crypto - mathematically - DCA definitely DOES NOT outperform the ""buy low, sell high"" strategy, that's why I don't mention it.*",cryptocurrency,1648467463.0
cardano,Difference between Yield Farming and Staking,"Investors have focused away from aggressive trading and toward passive income opportunities as major cryptocurrencies have flirted with all-time highs this year. One example of such an approach is questioning the validity of yield farming vs staking. Powered by low-interest rates in other markets and in response to active trading risks, yield farming and staking are becoming more popular ways to reward investors who HODL their favourite tokens and currencies.

**Yield Farming**

Yield farming is a technique for generating cryptocurrency from your digital assets. It's been compared to farming because it's a unique way to ""create your own cryptocurrency."" In exchange for interest, lending crypto assets to DeFi platforms locks them up in a liquidity pool, essentially a smart contract for holding funds.

**Staking**

Staking is lending your crypto assets to a blockchain network to help it stay alive and validate transactions. It's used by blockchain networks that use the proof of stake (PoS) consensus method. Investors get interest on their money while waiting for release block rewards.

**Comparing both Yield Farming and Staking**

When comparing yield farming with staking, staking is often the most straightforward method for creating passive income because investors just select a staking pool and then lock up their coins. But there's a catch: Cardano cryptocurrency initiatives don't force investors to lock their tokens into a pool because your assets are always free to use while earning passive income.",cryptocurrency,1648467636.0

# [Stock futures are flat as a big week of economic data kicks off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were steady Monday morning as a week filled with key economic reports kicked off, and investors continue to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve’s planned interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 points, while S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Tesla popped more than 5% in premarket trading on Monday on news it wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend to shareholders.
*****
&gt; The Securities and Exchange Commission filing said Tesla will ask at its annual shareholders meeting “for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock ... in order to enable a stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.”
*****
&gt; Elsewhere on Monday, parts of The Treasury yield curve inverted on Monday, raising some recession concerns. Earlier on Monday, the yield on the 5-year Treasury note rose to 2.6361%, while the 30-year yield was down less than 1 basis point to 2.6004%.
*****
&gt; However, the main yield spread that traders watch — the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate — remained positive for now.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 rose on Friday to close out their second consecutive winning week. The Dow gained 153 points, or 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.5% and has more than erased its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2% but still finished the week in the green.
*****
&gt; The moves came as investors continue to monitor developments in Russia’s war on Ukraine and expectations about the Fed’s plans to hike interest rates.
*****
&gt; “It seems the skyrocketing move higher with commodity prices has taken a break and that has allowed investors a chance to pile back into equities,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Geopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won’t be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned.”
*****
&gt; Investors continue to keep a close eye on the Fed. Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America penciled in half-point hikes in future Fed meetings this year after the central bank’s chair Jerome Powell vowed to be tough on inflation and said rate increases could become more aggressive if necessary.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the benchmark 10-year yield touched a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% as investors priced in a more aggressive rate hike cycle, which helped lift financial stocks while tech stocks pulled back.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking forward to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, this week. The JOLTS report is one set of employment data that the Federal Reserve is watching closely as it tightens monetary policy. ADP will also release its private payrolls data ahead of the main show, the closely watched monthly jobs report, on Friday.
*****
&gt; Monday is a light day for earnings reports but several big companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week, including BioNTech, Micron and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

personalfinance,Are we crazy to look at houses!?,"Hello all, 

Need some advice / a reality check from everyone here. Fiance (F27) and I (M24) are getting married this coming fall, and our apartment lease is up a month after the wedding. We're both ready to start looking at houses because we really like the area were in, but we need some people to check our math out to see if we can actually afford it. 
Financially, we have tried to pretty aggressively save money, but its very tough because we live in a HCOL area, and our expenses are somewhat significant. Here’s the breakdown: 

**Assets:**

M/F|Income|Cash|401k|Roth IRA|Unsecured Debt (Student Loans)|Secured Debt (Car)|Credit Score
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
M |120k yearly | 12k | 30k | 6k | 44k | 19k | 740ish
F | 85k yearly | 10k | 50k | 0 | 0 | 0 | 730ish

Combined monthly income after taxes &amp; various deductions (401k, health insurance, etc): **10.5k**

**Expenses (monthly):**

Rent (will likely increase when the lease ends this fall) | Internet* | Heating | Electric | Water | Phone | Food | Gas | Car Insurance | Student Loans (Nothing due till may) | Dogs
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
2400$ | 100$ | 150$ | 150$ | 100$ | 100$ | 600$ | 120$ (ish) | 230$ | 800$ | 150$ish

* Internet could be lower but I WFH, it helps to have fiber

Combined monthly expenses: **5000ish**

My Net Worth: **~10k**

Her Net Worth: **~70k**

Combined Net worth **~80k**

As I mentioned previously, we live in a HCOL – VHCOL locale, with the bare minimum houses (1000 sqft, 2bdrm 1ba) pushing 400k. We don’t want much, were just hoping to stay under 450k, and are more than willing to take on something that needs work. Additionally, a house will likely increase our transportation costs slightly because her commute will increase from 5 mins to likely 30 mins considering were trying to keep the housing prices somewhat ""reasonable"" lol.  

**Wildcard 1**: As I mentioned previously, were getting married this fall, so much of our extra money has gone toward this. Many expenses are already paid for, and we are doing it on the cheap in many ways (friend is DJing for free, venue &amp; caterer are cutting us friend deals, mine and her family are helping financially) but unfortunately, it’s still more expensive than I had hoped. Total debts left to be paid for it are likely around **13k**. 

**Wildcard 2**: Both of our cars are worth a significant amount considering the car market. Her car is worth ~19k (2015 Honda CRV, 80k miles), and is completely paid off. My car is worth ~27k, and I owe around 19k (21 Honda civic, 8k miles) on it. Considering that I work from home, we don’t particularly *need* two cars, but my loan is so ridiculously cheap (1.90% APR) and it’s under warranty for another two years, its hard to justify selling it. But the cash would be helpful for a down payment.

**Wildcard 3**: I just began my full time job after my masters last spring, and my income is likely to increase somewhat significantly as I gain experience in my field. **150k+ within a year or two** is very attainable. 

**Wildcard 4**: I have yet to make payments on my student loans because I haven't legally been required to, and they're currently sitting at 0% interest. I've instead used the money to build my savings and 401k. Once payments are actually required, I will refinance with a private company to reduce my interest rate (real current interest rate is around 6-7%) to likely around 3%.

**Wildcard 5**: Right now I'm MAXING my 401k this year (I maxed last year as well in only 6 months of work), and she is very close to that. We could temporarily reduce/eliminate our contributions to boost our cash savings, but this feels like were throwing money away from our employer matching. 

**Current Plan:** Were thinking about buying a house now using probably **20k down**, which *should* leave us enough to cover closing costs and the wedding expenses. I know it's not alot, but after the wedding, we will **G R I N D** to get rid our PMI and my student loans. I expect to completely eliminate my student loans in 2 years, and hopefully be out of PMI by then as well (We will likely double or triple student loan payments, etc). Will likely forego a honeymoon for a year to make it happen.

**TL;DR**: Basically, we have a temporary cash flow problem. We have enough income to afford a house, but we obviously don’t have enough cash for a 20% down payment. It’s just so hard to justify spending so much on rent (One that’s almost certainly going up soon) to not get any equity out of it. I know houses have many hidden expenses &amp; taxes, but a home loan for 450k is barely more expensive than our rent when you include the property tax even with our ""puny"" down payment. In addition, I'm very handy and both of our families are very handy, so we can likely tackle many expenses without paying much (My family has done a near complete teardown of a house.

technology,A Brief Introduction to the Phonon Protocol,"**Greetings Savvy Technologists**,

I would like to share with you an interesting technology. Up front I will caution you that this is about a hardware-enforced cryptographic system. It is not, however, yet another attempt to shill a blockchain or cryptocurrency. This is about a technology that exists at a more fundamental level. This will take some minutes to get going but by the end I believe you will appreciate the potential it brings.

The technology is called a Physical Unclonable Function or a PUF. It is found all around you already, in credit card chips and smartphones. PUFs are, in essence, something that leverages the imperfections in human manufacturing today. When we make a piece of silicon we can indeed make it highly pure. However, even despite the purity, this piece of silicon will still have varying degrees of unique responses when subjected to electricity. Think of it like a fingerprint that cannot be copied because our manufacturing technology isn't capable of overcoming the ever-expanding pull of entropy.

Now what can we do with this fingerprint? We can apply cryptography. We can encrypt information using the unique fingerprint of each individual PUF. We can then use this cryptography to create a secure enclave of data that can only exist in one single place on planet earth -- inside the enclave that is cryptographically signed by our PUF. This is enforced by unbreakable cryptography combined with unique hardware.

We have now created a way to stop someone from copying that information and claiming it is authentic. We have, in effect, created a way to stop counterfeiting of information... without needing a consensus mechanism such as Proof of Work.

But it does not end there. No, my friends, this rabbit hole goes much deeper.

As I said at the beginning, these PUFs are already widely available. They're very inexpensive. And we can use the secure enclave we make with a PUF, combined with blockchain, to securely store the private keys to thousands of blockchain addresses in a single credit card sized card.

And we can make it work with basically every existing blockchain today.

Using this, we will derive a protocol. The Phonon protocol. This protocol will enable any blockchain asset to be sent to a new address and then privately and securely ""wrapped"" inside of the secure enclave while also ensuring that the owner of the the asset has no knowledge of the keypair stored inside. This means we have now achieved two things: the store of information that cannot be counterfeited and the store of a keypair that cannot be double-spent because even the owner does not know the key. The owner possesses the key, inside their phonon on their card, but they do not and cannot know what the key is without destroying the phonon. And because of our PUF and the immutable nature of blockchain block height, no two phonons will ever use the same address twice.

We have now created a system wherein all existing blockchains are usable offline just like cash. No internet connection is required to trade phonons between peers. Phonons do not require the internet. Any kind of local peer-to-peer network will suffice.

And because of their nature phonons can be traded an infinite number of times... for next to no cost.

Phonon is a protocol that *scales all blockchains natively*, for no added cost, and: 

* Takes them offline when needed.
* Makes them 100% private between peers.
* Let's anyone trade any asset for any other. Do you want to trade ETH for BTC but don't want to use Coinbase? A simple exchange of phonons will suffice

And again, this can be done for basically every existing blockchain asset.

I hope this brief introduction was interesting and thought provoking.

Thank you for your time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

If you're curious about some of the problems and solutions presented with the protocol here are some final thoughts. I would encourage anyone to come to our Discord (Phonon DAO, link is on our website at phonon.network) to help us build out this ecosystem. We want to solve the problems that crypto faces, from environmental to scaling, to usability as a currency... all of them.

There are a number of other matters to consider regarding the phonon protocol, including:

* Native phonons, a type of phonon which do not require any blockchain whatsoever and can be used fully offline. Native phonons require no GPU or traditional mining hardware.
* Monetary policy and emissions of native phonons.
* Certificate Authorities and how they can be used with minimal risk.
* Loss recovery - if you lose cash, it is gone. Phonons are more resilient than that.
* Expanding PUF-based storage: Side-loading with encrypted off-card storage.
* PUF reliability and hardware failure prediction (e.g. write cycles).
* Java applet distribution to embedded SIMs (eSIMs) in today's smartphones.
* Attestation of phonons for offline use, in order to solve the impersonator blockchain problem.",technology,1648478362.0
stocks,An inverted yield curve need not cause panic - Financial Times,"Sorry I know this is pretty dense, but I think these two articles are worth a read. The [FT article is much shorter](https://archive.ph/mHJhb#selection-2069.0-2094.0) so you can start with that one:

&gt; An alternative interpretation of a potential inversion is that bond markets are on board with the Fed’s strategy and believe that inflation will stabilise in the long term. A far more concerning prospect is a steep rise in long-term yields. This would indicate market belief that high rates will be needed for some time in order to achieve price stability. At the moment, movements in equity markets indicate that many investors remain bullish — the S&amp;P 500 has shown no signs of sustained falls.

&gt; Either way, there is good reason to think that “this time is different”. The predictive powers of inversion have never been truly tested at a time of very large central bank holdings of long-term debt. The Fed not only has to make choices about the level at which to set its main short-term policy rate but also how to manage its own vast stock of Treasuries. At present, Powell is indicating the central bank will first raise short-term rates and only then start selling its longer-dated bonds. An inverted yield curve would make some sense if markets believe the Fed will see this policy through.

&gt; Inverted yield curves may have historically predicted recession, but what inversion has meant in the past does not preclude a different outcome now or in the future. In any case, as all good economists know, an exception is always needed to prove a rule.

Here's another more [technical article from Reuters](https://archive.ph/FkPR0) arguing that U.S. Treasury yield curve divergence sends mixed recession signals.

&gt; But the 2-year/10-year yield curve also has its technical issues, and not everyone is convinced it's telling the true story.
&gt; ""Something like 2s/10s, or 5s/30s, will definitely tell you that we're a lot flatter than we've ever been at the start of a hiking cycle,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

&gt; ""Part of that is just the sheer amount of Treasuries that the Fed bought during their COVID QE (quantitative easing) program."" Analysts said the Fed's QE the last two years has resulted in an undervalued U.S. 10-year yield and could explain away the disparity in the two yield curves.

&gt; Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI in New York cited research which suggests the 10-year yield would be around 3.60% without that stimulus. When the Fed starts shrinking its balance sheet via quantitative tightening, Shipley said the 10-year yield will rise to fair value.

&gt; The U.S. 10-year yield was last at 2.475% after hitting a peak of 2.5% on Friday, the highest since May 2019.

&gt; ""Without QE/balance sheet expansion, the 10-year and 2-year spread would be around 140 basis points, which is hardly threatening and consistent with the 10-year and 3-month spread,"" Shipley said.

&gt; The Evercore analyst thinks the 10-year yield should approach fair value in the first half of 2024, or about 120 basis points higher than the current level.

&gt; The U.S. 2-year yield, on the other hand, is fairly priced and Shipley expects the 2s-10s curve to widen.

&gt; What does it mean for the U.S. economy?

&gt; ""Some of the 2-10 shape is down to the fact this is a far more aggressively priced Fed cycle than usual, the notion of how quickly the Fed will move is very front-loaded,"" said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy, at State Street.

&gt; ""I suspect we will get a growth slowdown but will it lead to recession? It may be next year's story. Households will want to see the fuel prices coming down but generally household balance sheets are in pretty good shape.""

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin (PoW) Mining Energy Consumption,"**TLDR:** Bitcoin mining currently uses \~0.1% of global energy consumption. Due to its competitive nature and unique properties, bitcoin mining leads to miners setting up or relocating its operations in areas with the cheapest sources of energy. This enables miners to use energy sources that have low demand, are off-grid, and/or would typically be wasted. Lastly, partnerships between energy producers and bitcoin miners provide an opportunity to enhance energy infrastructure and make otherwise unprofitable renewable energy investments profitable. This is further influenced by national and global energy consumption targets.

**Note:** The objective of this article is to summarize the content from 10+ sources. If anyone asks you about bitcoin energy consumption, I hope this will be a great resource to reference. I highly recommend reviewing the sources below to dig deeper into the bitcoin mining energy consumption rabbit hole!

**Introduction**

Bitcoin mining has been accused of consuming a substantial amount of energy, typically comparing bitcoin mining energy consumption with that of countries or large companies. Because of its large consumption of energy, bitcoin mining drives up electricity prices for consumers, requires a large carbon footprint, and is causing environmental issues within communities (e.g. heating Seneca Lake in New York). If bitcoin continues to survive, energy consumption will continue to increase, which could be a threat to global warming. And what’s the point of bitcoin anyway? Its energy use per transaction is through the roof and is, therefore, a waste!

In this article, I will provide context to the claims mentioned above in order to illustrate that critics are misinformed about bitcoin mining and are not considering the potential long term benefits to energy infrastructure and the environment.

**Global Energy**

In 2019, the world produced 173,000 TWh (terawatt hours) of energy. It is estimated that about 33% of global energy was wasted during that time. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining consumed about 120-140 TWh.A, B

*Bitcoin mining consumes a very small amount of global energy.*

**Energy Consumption Comparisons**

Bitcoin consumes more energy than many countries consume, including Ukraine and Norway.C This statement sounds outrageous - how can bitcoin consume so much energy!? It is deceiving to compare bitcoin mining energy consumption to that of other countries without putting this into perspective. Large online platforms such as Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon all use more energy than countries use. More surprisingly, the cruise industry, Christmas lights, household drying machines, and private jets use more energy than countries use.B Gold mining requires 131 TWh of energy.D For additional context, more comparisons can be viewed in the two charts below.

*Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than some countries consume; however, without providing context, critics downplay the fact that many other appliances, seasonal traditions, industries, and companies also consume more energy than these countries consume.*

**Electricity Prices**

Bitcoin mining is highly competitive, which drives miners to search for the cheapest electricity. Profitable miners require much cheaper energy than the global average (\~14 cents/KWh), ideally 5 cents/KWh or less.A Cheap energy is only found in locations where there are no (or very low) opportunity costs and no (or very low) buyers. Bitcoin mining has unique propertiesF that enable miners to find this cheap energy:

1. **Location Independent:** Miner hardware is easily transportable and only requires an internet connection or cellular data. This enables miners to set up near renewable energy producers prior to the producers being connected to the grid, use off-grid energy (e.g. flaring), and use otherwise curtailed energy  

   1. *Example:* Before mining was banned in China, miners would move between provinces seasonally to use cheap hydroelectric power in the Sichuan provinceB
2. **Flexible Load**: Although potentially not profitable or not as profitable on paper (more on that later), mining downtime is not catastrophic to business operations such as server farms. Some hardware is able to power down while other hardware stays on at a few second’s notice, which offers unmatchable grid flexibility  

   1. *Example:* Texas grid operator can notify miners to power down hardware, which can be automated and completed in secondsG
3. **Scale Independence:** Mining hardware can be spread out globally; scaling does not require large amounts of hardware in one location  

   1. *Example:* One mining company can spread its hardware across multiple countries to use various cheap energy sources

Energy produced from oil, coal, and gas is not likely to be the target energy source of bitcoin miners due to the high opportunity cost of each of these resources. On the other hand, excess nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas flaring, and other wasted energies have low opportunity costs.A

1. **Nuclear** energy is a consistent energy source that produces a surplus that can be used by bitcoin mining
2. **Hydroelectric** energy is expensive to transport, and the source can be found far away from population centers. Electricity cost is around 3-5 cents per KWh. In 2019, 4,306 TWh were produced
3. **Flared gas** is the methane gas produced as a byproduct from oil wells that are far away from pipeline infrastructure. The typical process to flare gas is expensive and inefficient, especially on windy days. Due to increased demand from bitcoin mining, mining companies have innovated a transportable technology that captures the gas, pipes it into a generator, and flares the gas for energy without releasing any gas into the atmosphere. Without this technology (and miners), flaring would release methane into the atmosphere, which is more environmentally harmful than carbon dioxide.H The opportunity for using flared gas is large - about 688 TWhD to 1,500 TWhA of methane could be flared each year globally. To add context, the US Energy Information Administration estimated that 150 TWh of energy was vented or flared per day in the US in 2019, which is enough power to supply all bitcoin miners. Working with miners to flare gas is a huge opportunity for energy producers because it enables them to score high Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores and meet state flaring limitsB
4. **Other Wasted Energies** such as geothermal in Iceland,D reopening hydroelectric plants in Canada that used to supply lumber, pulp, and paper mills, repurposing coal plants into natural gas plants in New York, and providing revenue to stranded power plants that are waiting on transmission line infrastructureB are cheap sources of energy that can be harnessed by bitcoin miners

At face value, solar and wind energies lack the consistency needed to mine bitcoin profitably; however, there are solutions that provide a symbiotic relationship between bitcoin mining and these energies in the short term (this will be discussed below).

Note: Bitcoin mining results in increased capital investment being dedicated to infrastructure that produces cheap electricity (due to its financial reward).A The repurposed coal plant mentioned above has received criticism from environmentalists that bitcoin mining has caused Lake Seneca to overheat. This is a one-off scenario in which bitcoin mining may be the main factor that led to the reopening and repurposing of a plant that is negatively impacting the local ecosystem. Bitcoin mining goes to where the cheap energy is. This is an opportunity for policy makers to craft legislation to protect local ecosystems. This is not and will not be the last time an old plant is reopened or repurposed.

*“Imagine a 3D topographic map of the world with cheap energy hotspots being lower and expensive energy being higher. I imagine Bitcoin mining being akin to a glass of water poured over the surface, settling in the nooks and crannies, and smoothing it out.”* Nic Carter

**Threat to Global Warming**

As stated in the sections above, bitcoin mining’s unique properties enable miners to find cheap energy sources that have a lower carbon footprint, would have been wasted, or provide a net benefit to reducing methane emissions. Solar and wind energies provide an unconventional opportunity for energy producers and miners. Initially, I was skeptical about solar and wind energies since they are not consistent sources of energy throughout the day or seasons. For these renewable energies to provide sufficient, consistent energy to consumers, energy providers need to overbuild solar and wind farms so that the minimum energy produced is able to supply consumers without blackouts. This is incredibly expensive because solar and wind farms do not have a buyer for the oversupply of energy during peak hours, and batteries are costly.

California and Texas have been in the news recently because their reliance on renewable energy caused blackouts.I In the past, neither of these states had recurring blackouts; however, their overreliance on renewable energy has created a systemic energy supply issue. Some of the solutions discussed are listed below:

1. Reopen nuclear and natural gas plants in California
2. Weatherproof nuclear and natural gas plants in Texas
3. Overbuild solar and wind farms
4. Implement a strategy that includes a mixture of the above options

Option 3 (or 4) has the potential to be cheaper and more feasible with the help of bitcoin mining. The timing of the construction of solar and wind farms and supporting grid infrastructure are not always aligned. If solar and wind farms are built but do not have sufficient transmission line infrastructure, bitcoin miners can buy the farms’ electricity.J, B This is a symbiotic relationship that provides revenue to the solar and wind farms and provides otherwise wasted electricity to bitcoin miners. Currently West Texas produces 32 GW of solar and wind energy, has a 5 GW load, and can transmit 12 GW of energy to laid centers outside of West Texas.H The outstanding energy is curtailed but could be a perfect energy source for bitcoin miners that increases revenue of the renewable energy farms.

Once solar and wind farms are constructed and have the supporting infrastructure to provide its energy supply to the grid, bitcoin mining can use its flexible load property to power down, as needed, in the case of an energy shortage.H Critics rightfully claim that bitcoin mining is only profitable if the mining hardware runs everyday; however, innovative contracts between energy supplier and miners have terms that exchange powering down temporarily for a rebate. Reducing energy demand within seconds is much easier and faster for grid operators than deploying ‘peaker plants’ (typically natural gas) to increase energy supply. This ‘controllable load’ assists with decarbonizing the grid and is in line with the International Energy Agency’s 2030 goal of dedicating 500 GW electricity to new demand response resources in an attempt to meet renewable energy goals and modernize the grid.G

Even with a rebate built into a contract between a miner and energy producer, there is still skepticism about whether miners would use this energy over other cheap energy sources since there is a risk the rebate does not cover the costs of powering down. This skepticism assumes all mining hardware is equal; however, this is hardly the case. Although new miners will use on-grid, cheap energy with high uptime (e.g. nuclear, hydroelectric), older mining hardware needs to use the cheapest power, which can be found in intermittent renewables. In 2021, Bitmain S9’s were 5 years old yet represented 30% of the mining network. Another consideration is that ASIC development cycles are slowing, which allows miners to search for cheap energy rather than periodically upgrading their hardware.H

Stranded power is an issue that not only occurs with overbuilding renewable energy but also when power plants are built in anticipation of users in a community (e.g. hospital, office). If the building plans fall through, there is an overabundance of energy in that community. Also, stranded power is a large problem in developing countries. This is an opportunity for developing countries to invest capital in energy resources and modernize their infrastructure.B

In summary, bitcoin mining’s competitive search for cheap energy enables renewable energy to be more profitable (waste less energy),H provides a quick-reacting demand response resource (resilient grid), reduces construction risk and grid congestion,K and allocates more capital to cheap energy. All of these factors will help modernize the grid, encourage investment in renewables (including fusion),L and increase the innovation and advancement in renewables.

More optimistic claims argue that the marginal cost of producing electricity may approach zero, and bitcoin mining could move us to a Type I civilization on the Kardashev scale (current estimate is 100-200 years from today).B, L A Type I civilization is defined as a civilization that “can use and store all of the energy available on its planet.”O

Although it is difficult to measure bitcoin mining’s global carbon footprint,M the Bitcoin Mining Council provides transparency for 36 companies that represent 46% of the mining network. A summary can be found below:

Furthermore, it has been estimated that carbon emissions are on pace to be net zero or negative by 2031.D

*Bitcoin mining will subsidize renewable energy and strengthen and modernize grids, which will enable the world to achieve its climate goals.*

**Payments Comparisons**

Proof of work (PoW) critics like to compare bitcoin transaction volume with other established payments networks like Visa. This data can be extrapolated to say bitcoin transactions consume X% energy whereas Visa transactions only consume Y% of energy. Alex De Vries (former PwC Netherlands) is notorious for bashing bitcoin and PoW for being incredibly energy intensive per transaction and per block.B However, this is not a fair comparison of assessing energy consumption for bitcoin for the following reasons:

1. Bitcoin energy consumption should not be measured by transactions per second. Energy consumption remains consistent no matter how many transactions are confirmed in a block. This is similar to measuring the energy consumption of your computer by using number of emails sent as the metric (e.g. 10 emails/day vs 100 emails/day)B
2. Bitcoin (5-7 transactions per second) is a payments settlement layer and would be better compared to the Federal Reserve’s settlement layer Fedwire (10 transactions per second). Visa is a layer on top of Fedwire; lightning network (unlimited transactions) is most similar to Visa (claims between 1,700-24,000 transactions per second)B
3. Bitcoin’s energy consumption is a feature, not a bug. It ensures immutability of the blockchainL

Over time, bitcoin mining’s energy consumption increases at a slower rate than the increase in the total value secured by the system.L It is estimated that if bitcoin’s price increased to $1 million per bitcoin, bitcoin would still only use 0.6% of the world’s energy consumption. With this high valuation, bitcoin may have absorbed energy usually consumed from parts of the global banking system.B

At a high level, bitcoin’s energy consumption is capped; when the bitcoin price increases, energy consumption increases; however, every four years, the block reward is halved, which reduces energy consumption. The other part of the block reward (transaction fees) is limited by the threshold in which users would be unwilling to pay the fees.M

*Bitcoin energy consumption should not be compared to that of a payments layer (e.g. Visa); the energy consumption is used for bitcoin’s financial infrastructure that includes a settlement layer, payments layer(s), currency creation, incentives, and infrastructure security / immutability.*

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Outlook: Sustainable Price Increase or Temporary Breakthrough?,"The Crypto market has recovered 25% since Fed’s March FOMC meeting.  
***Sustainable Price Increase or Temporary Breakthrough?***  


First off, why did risk assets sell off at the start of this year and then bounce back after the FOMC meeting? Because of several factors.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Great Fall: Monetary Policy Outlook.

Balance sheet expansion from central banks slowed down big time in 2021  
—&gt; lower momentum of liquidity growth  
—&gt; lower momentum of high-risk asset rally (BTC included)

Then financial conditions started to tighten as inflation and commodity prices went up. Central banks around the world began raising rates. 15 Central Banks have already hiked the rates.   
More CBs are about to do so soon.

Also, liquidity has started flowing out of Central Banks' balance sheets.

However, the magnitude of actual damage to market liquidity from all above does not justify the whopping +20% selloff of Nasdaq in the first months of the year. The market was front-running the tightening of financial conditions: they were **already priced in**.

&amp;#x200B;

[OFR Financial Stress Index](https://preview.redd.it/uk1nonl8f6q81.png?width=962&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=439ba12195bc32fb347ecaaeed47f4b7a16f0e29)

Without any question, more tightening will and should be the path forward for at least the next 6 months with unemployment very low and inflation at a generational high.   
This and the decreasing market liquidity will hurt crypto, which is mostly still a risk-on asset.

Something that is clear is that **High Inflation is squeezing investment inflow**.   
Inflation not only makes future cash flow discounts steeper, hurting growth investments like Crypto and Web3, but it also leaves less disposable cash in people’s pockets to invest since you need to spend more on real-life necessities.

""But Bitcoin is supposed to be an inflation hedge, so shouldn’t high inflation be good for crypto?""

It shouldn’t. Inflation hedges like gold protect from monetary inflation caused by too much printing.   
It doesn’t protect from inflation caused by supply chain problems and commodity shortages.   
(when there's a food shortage, what are we gonna eat: a gold bar or bitcoin instead?)

  
Lastly, meanwhile in 2020/21 new L1/L2s helped to expand the “territory” and “population” of the overall blockchain universe.  Since mid-2021, innovation &amp; horizontal expansion have slowed. Ethereum economic activities peaked in May last year.

# The Majestic Comeback: Geopolitical uncertainty prompting higher demand for financial sovereignty.

A few years from now, we will recognize the past month as a defining moment in history that started the next chapter of global crypto adoption. 

Sanctions related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict are heightening awareness of the importance of financial sovereignty. It is helping boost the adoption of a trustless financial system built on Blockchain.

But that’s a gradual process. while inflation/monetary tightening is a freight train coming our way right now. The former is not a sufficient countervailing force to the latter in short term.

Indeed, we are seeing more and more **Institutional Adoption:** Institutional trading volume in crypto has increased from a 30% of the total crypto vol in 2020 to a 70% now.   
More institutional adoption will definitively be coming, but this is again a gradual process.

At the moment, we are seeing that Blockchain is gaining more **real-life use cases**. These won’t be overnight successes and likely won’t show in price action in short term. But there's no doubt: in the next couple of years we’ll see huge adoption waves prompted by more accessibility of crypto products in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

# How will this play out?

I don't know.

In the immediate term, we’re due for a rebound as the FOMC March meeting gave clearer forward guidance of monetary actions and markets mean-revert from oversold. With the BTC rebound, alt token rotation will surely follow.

Looking for some advice on which would be the better option to finance a pool and patio.  It's a pretty big purchase around $100 to $150k and we are considering a HELOC vs Equity Loan.

There are no fees, closing costs, minimum draws, or prepayment penalties with either option.  With talk of rising inflation, higher interest rates, and possible recession; I'm wondering if a fixed loan might be better.

personalfinance,Question about minimum escrow balance for a mortgage in CA,"Howdy.

Recently received a letter saying that the required escrow beginning balance is not enough, and as such, they will be increasing the escrow portion of my mortgage training, like so (numbers simplified):

* Estimated Escrow Beginning Balance: $200
* Required Escrow Beginning Balance: $2000

Based on their ""review"", I'm short $1800, and I'm being told over the phone that ""that amount reflects the increase in taxes (property value increase) and insurance costs"". However, those have increased by 700 and 100 dollars, respectively.

When I bring the $1000 difference, the person at the support line says that ""that is the calculation that is being given to them""- when pressed, the only thing the support person is giving me as a reference is the ""Real State Settlement Procedures Act"" or [RESPA](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_supervision-and-examination-manual_respa-exam-procedures.pdf), a 118 pages document that I'm too dumb to understand.

I've been hanged up twice this morning for trying to make sense. If I understand escrow correctly, the balance should be near 0 at the end of the year- I pay early and monthly for their peace of mind, they deduct as payments come, sometimes I even make a few dollars in interest from the escrow that it is added to the balance- now they are claiming that there's a magic number, whose math I'm not allowed to see, that says they want to hold $1000 more for shits and giggles, which is not up for scrutiny, debate or even understanding by us muggles.

We used to pay taxes and insurance out of our accounts, but during the last refinance we were told that going through escrow would afford us lower interest rate and we bought into it thinking it was ok, but I'm starting to think they're taking me for a ride.

To add insult to injury, the communication that was sent to me included a forecast of the future payments from and to escrow for 2022/2023, in which they keep the estimates for taxes and insurance the same (!!!), and only the balance increasing. So it's not even that at the end of the year I'll see my increased escrow payments go to, well, paying escrow-related costs, but it's just used to pad the balance.

Is this normal? Should I be concerned that the two times I've called I've been given no response, and when pressed, I'm being hung up? (I can be a bit autistic and call them out when they answer things I have not asked, but I am being firm and polite):

&gt; Me: so what is the math involved to arrive at the extra $1000?

&gt; Operator: the required minimum escrow balance is $2000.

&gt; Me: that is not what I asked. Where is the math, or which section of RESPA says I need to be at that amount?

&gt; Operator: we do not have that information. the required minimum escrow balance is $2000.

&gt; Me: can I please talk to someone who can elaborate?

&gt; Operator: No, but they have estimated that your minimum escrow balance is $2000.

Repeat for 20 minutes or so until they mute themselves (I stop hearing the typical office background noise), wait for a minute, then hang up.

CryptoCurrency,The reason why Coinbase will list any ERC20 token but not your favorite niche project.,"A semi-common sentiment I see on subreddits for some small-cap coins I follow is that people want to see the project listed on major CEXs, we'll say Coinbase for example, or why their favorite token doesn't get listed, but the hottest new ERC20 shitcoin is, or why projects only trade as ERC20 tokens on coinbase.

I'm a law student and I recently learned something in blockchain class that might help explain this behavior from the central exchanges, beyond them just getting big bags of shitcoins for cheap, so I thought I would ~~farm some moons~~ share with you all.

If you live in America, as a crypto enthusiast you might have heard of the [BitLicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLicense), a license CEXs are required to get to offer services in New York State. Coinbase has two of these, but so do a few other popular CEXs like Gemini, and more are supposedly working on acquiring one, including Crypto.com and Kraken. It's the first and only state in the US to require this level of regulatory compliance so far, because New York loves to swing its big finance industry dick around.

In order for a CEXs with a Bitlicense to list a token or asset, they have to go through a process with the NYS Department of Financial Services, which you can see in [this flowchart.](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/virtual_currency_businesses/coin_listing_process)

NYDFS requires new coin listings to be certified in various ways to make sure that they are not financial securities, that the network is not vulnerable to known exploits, that there isn't a centralization problem, etc. NYDFS is also extremely understaffed, so this is not exactly a simple process if CEXs choose to go through the NYDFS channels. CEXs *do* however, have an option to self certify a token if it meets certain requirements, [which you can read here.](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/virtual_currency_businesses/pr_guidance_regarding_listing_of_vc) 

I believe that Coinbase is so willing to list ERC-20 tokens because they are standardized assets on the Ethereum network, and Coinbase can skip all the cybersecurity analysis and just self certify them with minimal paperwork on their end, whereas any new network would require significantly more work on their end, and their certification policy probably doesn't reach beyond ERC-20 tokens.

TL;DR The reason your favorite smallcap project isn't on Coinbase is because the government, of New York specifically, makes it a pain for them to list it.",cryptocurrency,1648507107.0

We *just* bought an apartment so our cash reserve is nearly tapped out right now. We’ve considered a few options for covering this bill and it looks like taking a loan from one (or both) of our 401k’s is the best option for us.

personalfinance,"Lord Abbett to Vanguard Transfer, need advice","My aunt had setup an account with Lord Abbett when I was born, and just a few years ago, I was given access to the account and became responsible for reporting it on my tax return. I have a Roth IRA and a taxable account with Vanguard (TSP through the federal government for my main retirement account), and would like to roll up the Lord Abbett into Vangaurd. My questions are:

1. Should I expect to loose any money for transferring it?

2. If I liquidate all the shares of Class A funds and turn them into VTI and VXUS, will I have any taxable gains that I need to report? I already have been reporting the dividends on my tax return, not sure if this will count as capital gains or not.

3. I’m thinking it would make the most sense to roll it into the Roth IRA, but is there any benefit to putting it into the taxable?

Thank you all for your help.",finance,1648528145.0
Bitcoin,Has the 2022 Bitcoin uptrend begun?,"Bitcoin continues to trade in correlation with risk assets, specifically the NASDAQ, essentially acting like a leveraged bet on tech. So, it was unsurprising to see it trade above $48,000 for the first time on Monday following a stock market rebound led by tech. 

The recent rally has also been fuelled by the possibility of Russia accepting BTC as payment for oil/gas, and further development on this front would help Bitcoin continue to establish itself in the eye of mainstream investors. If global sentiment also continues to improve, Bitcoin could easily extend its gains alongside other risk assets, although it would likely need to convincingly break its 200-day MA before targeting a retest of the December highs at $52,000.

However, the prospect of more aggressive interest rate hiking cycles, as well as further breakdowns in relations between Russia and The West still pose a threat to investor’s risk appetite. It is therefore important to remember all trading carries risk, as shorts could see Bitcoin hovering near the key 200-day MA as a solid entry point on speculation of a return to risk-adverse trading.",cryptocurrency,1648529016.0

personalfinance,Should I back out of my new construction agreement?,"Hey All,

I signed a new build construction agreement in January for a home that will be completed it August. The home with minimal structural upgrades is $700,000. We are planning to put 20% down ($140k). My wife and I make $195k (Around $210k with bonuses). There is a 1.9% tax rate (includes the 20 year special assessment) which is standard in every new construction home and applies to most all used homes in the area since they are within 20 years old.

My largest predicament lies in that we are not allowed to lockin a mortgage interest rate until May with the preferred lender so what would have been a 3% is now 5% and likely worse in May when we can lockin a rate. At this loan amount it's a drastic increase in our expected monthly payment, especially coupled in with the high tax rate.

What was $3350 is now $4300 based off current mortgage rates.

We bought early phase and the current home, with equivalent upgrades is now going for $755k and they are still in the first 1/3 of phases.

We were paying $2600 for rent for a condo in San Diego and this is a suburb about an hour North.

We both work from home, but our employer requires us to live in California. We save considerably on gas, but we will have $460 of student loan payments between the two of us once we have to start paying them again. My wife will continue to get incremental raises and I will likely still continue to promote and receive raises to where expected income will likely go up 6% a year over the next 3-4 years.

We have our first baby due in August and my wife is emotionally attached to the need for the house, but is this house even rationale for us to keep or should I forgoe my deposit?

This was one of the cheaper houses in the city and even lower quality new builds I could sign for today would be more expensive with how fast prices are still going up. I'm really not sure what to do as this is one of the least expensive places in So Cal to live and it still feels like we can't afford it.

Any advice on how over budget we are would be greatly appreciated. We are considering leaving the state, but we want our family within a fair distance while the baby is young for help.

Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

Trading,Is GBP/USD eyeing fresh lows?,"Although GBP/USD bounced off the key psychological support level of 1.3000, the upside was capped after last week’s surging inflation data. 

Normally rising inflation would increase speculation on higher interest rates and support the currency higher, however, the opposite seems to be the case in the UK after a dovish BOE expressed concerns over the impact record high prices might have on households during their last meeting. This is in contrast to an increasingly hawkish Fed, which is evident when looking at the DXY, as it attempts to close back above 99 before potentially targeting 100. 

GBP/USD may therefore be at risk of new lows as the Dollar looks to extend its gains, and a break below 1.3000 could see losses for the pair accelerate. 

Of course, it’s important to remember that all trading carries risk. GBP/USD’s direction (like most other assets at the moment) is likely to continue being driven by headlines relating to Ukraine and central banks, and if bearish pressure on GBP eases, it could hold above 1.3000 over the coming days, opening the possibility for a rebound.",finance,1648542685.0

personalfinance,Forgot to include 1099 in my tax return. Tax return got accepted by state and federal.,"I filed my taxes yesterday, and I forgot to include a 1099 in my tax return. The total amount on the 1099 is $149.77. However, my tax return got accepted by the IRS and by the state government. 
I used FreeTaxUSA to file my return.

Do I need to file an amended tax return? Or do I have the option of including this 1099 + any accrued interest in my next year's tax return? I just want to do the right thing here, but it also costs $14.98 to file an amended tax return, which seems like a total waste considering that is probably around what I will end up owing.

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday morning, putting the major averages on track to build on the previous session’s gains, as traders awaited key economic data.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 139 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Consumer confidence and home price data to be released Tuesday, ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs report. Economists expect to see 460,000 jobs added in March and the unemployment rate to fall to 3.7%, according to Dow Jones estimates.
*****
&gt; Traders are also monitoring the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war, as peace talks get under way in Turkey. To be sure, both sides have said they are not close to reaching a deal. Ahead of the negotiations, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on that “nothing is agreed upon unless everything is agreed upon.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the U.K. warned that Russian troops still pose a “significant threat” to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, noting that Russia is reorganizing its forces.
*****
&gt; In fixed income, the 5-year Treasury note rose above the 30-year on Monday and held there on Tuesday, marking the first inversion since 2006. The shift stoked some recession fears, although economists typically watch the spread between the 2-year and 10-year rate, which remains positive.
*****
&gt; “Our base case is that the US economy can avoid a recession, lowering the threat of a sustained downtrend in stocks. As such, investors should brace for higher rates—including potentially adding exposure to value and financial stocks which tend to outperform as central bank policy tightens—without overreacting by exiting equity markets,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 rose 94.65 points and 0.7%, respectively, to notch three-day winning streaks. The Nasdaq was the big outperformer, jumping 1.3%.

CryptoCurrency,I've always wondered why the US Federal Government never went after Tether. Then I find out that the US Government gave fraudsters 500 Billion.,"###Tether rundown

Tether has always cast a dark shadow over crypto, and every bull run it probably takes the cake in terms of one of the biggest perceived risks to the integrity of the crypto the crypto market.

The issues have been well and truly covered in other more detailed posts on here. The quick TDLR is that a company of ~20 people manages 80 billion, that has been proven in court to lie about it's reserves and company relationships in the past, and basically hasn't confirmed it's got the reserves now, just more of a trust me bro.


This article provides a good summary:
 https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin


You can even read the New York attorney general statement in its settlement with tether

https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal


###The really really big question I always had is, why isn't more being done to check them?


As crypto regulations aren't really in place but what Tether is dabbling in, is surely within the purview of the law. The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets even went to the extent of saying so in it's crypto report that finally came out, in short saying get on with it to the regulators.

https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0454


###The reality of the system


Well today a news article has come out and said that the shear amount of theft through clear as day fraud in the Covid relief loans/programs was north of **500 billion** . That's an estimate because no one actually really knows!


*Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the $579 billion in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan*


https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/biggest-fraud-generation-looting-covid-relief-program-known-ppp-n1279664


The government has lost upwards of 500 billion, the equivalent of the marketcap of Facebook vanishing. More then enough to fix alot of broken infrastructure, give everyone decent internet and more. In other words make the country a better place.


I answered my question sadly, and it's why would the government look into Tether. They can't even prevent just mind blowing, uncomplicated, well within the definition of the law fraud. I mean they created these programs like that.

So they aren't going to be able to tackle the mastermind of the former plastic surgeon/pirated software seller turned Tether CEO.

Maybe some token enforcement here and there, but it just seems the system is broken and all you need is no morals to make bank.


*that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it*


**TDLR: The US Government gave a blank check to fraudsters to the tune of 500 billion plus, they aren't going to look into Tether, as that's too competent of a move**",cryptocurrency,1648556004.0
personalfinance,Overcoming anxiety and sunk costs fallacy,"Tl;dr - Young guy leaving very high paying job to start a business. What are your thoughts?

I’ll start this off by saying I am feeling fairly anxious about taking the leap. On one hand, I have done all of my research, have a very clear plan and the start-up capital to make it happen (more on that later), but on the other hand am falling prey to the sunk costs fallacy. I would appreciate your thoughts here on if this is a sensible course of action!

**The Situation:** From the US, but living in London. I’m 24 years old, went to a top school here and have been working in biglaw for two years (as a trainee - so making roughly 75k USD p/a). I have a job lined up that is paying $200k starting. Despite all of that, I am honestly fed up with the lifestyle. I don’t want to go on too much about that, but suffice to say that I hate my job everyday and am constantly planning my way out. In the past two years, I do not think I have had a single day where I have enjoyed what I do. I find the hours gruelling and have been counting down the days until I can leave.

**The Plan:** I currently own three properties - one in London and two in the US. Currently acquiring my fourth. I have passive cash flow of around 5k gross per month from my properties, and around 1.4k net (after bills, health/car insurance, mortgages, tax etc - pretty much everything except food + leisure). I have a huge interest in real estate and have recently become a licensed realtor in my home state. This is all to pursue my goal of buying and flipping houses full time. I did my first project earlier this year and it went really well - that is to say I have a team and a process that has been through at least one round of testing. That being said, the property we did was one I already owned (so did not have exorbitant interest accruing on a hard money loan), but the actual mechanics of refurbishing the place went well. To start the business, I have roughly 120k USD in cash (which, of course, would be leveraged to buy the flips), and the idea would be that I leave my job and go back to the US to start the business. Just to be clear, I am **NOT** asking here for an evaluation of whether my business model is practical (that would be a whole separate discussions which would require its own post to set out - that being said, if anyone is interested, I am happy to go into it). I am more so seeking comfort (or advice in the alternative), at the prospect of leaving such a high paying job, switching countries and starting a business. A part of me is saying ‘tough it out for a few years and make some serious cash and then do the property stuff’ but, as I said above, I am incredibly fed up with the lifestyle, and life on qualification is only going to get more demanding. I don’t know if I can mentally handle 6 *months*, forget years.

I have spent months, if not years, thinking about this plan, and have run all of the numbers, come up with the projections, built models etc. You may be thinking ‘if you have run all the numbers, why are you asking this question’ - that is, in all honestly, a completely fair question. I suppose what I am looking for is some sort of validation that the risk is worth it (not in a monetary sense - as I said, I have found comfort in the numbers, but more so if the risk of *not* having that salary, stability etc behind you, or perhaps some similar anecdotal experience (whether it was worth it or not). I’d wrap this up by saying I appreciate that I am in an extremely fortunate position. I have had to work extremely hard to get to where I am (came from a very low-income background), which is kind of fuelling the anxiety I have about leaving law to start the business. Something I have that has brought me comfort is that, after a year of trying, if I have not hit certain (reasonable) targets, then I can always come back to law. Would really appreciate your thoughts :)",finance,1648557449.0

defi,"[Data simulation]: DeFi interest rate farming VS Trading strategies (""Sell high, Buy low"" variations)","Dear redditors,

In this topic I am providing a follow-up to a ""research"" (I put that in quotes, because some people might disagree with my methodology or ""data"") about whether it is better to manage your crypto assets via secure constant/compound interest rate farming or is it better/reasonable to get involved in ""active trading"" (e.g. sell at major market peaks and repurchase again - with the entire capital - at bottoms). Original topic, which has prompted this simulation: [**\[Discussion\] Investment strategy: ""HODL / Staking / DeFi farm"" vs ""Buy Low, Sell High""**](https://np.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/tq7a0s/discussion_investment_strategy_hodl_staking_defi/)

# Abstract:

While famous reddit data research studies such as this ([**Timing the market: The absolute worst vs absolute best vs slow and steady**](https://np.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/)) done on traditional investment markets, such as putting your savings in the S&amp;P500 index, has argued that the **DCA strategy** (Dollar Cost Averaging, or simply to invest a regular sum at regular intervals, without worrying about the price to offset price fluctuations) is better than **""Timing the market"" strategy** (to try to but an asset always as price bottoms, but without selling it at peaks), there are important reasons why I personally disagree about these DCA studies being 100% applicable to crypto markets. If we compare the Bitcoin and S&amp;P500 index prices (over all-time history, and last 5 years, see charts below), we will notice two things:

1. Bitcoin is highly more volatile than S&amp;P500 index (and traditional stocks). It has many clear ""peaks"" and ""bottoms"" which server as good opportunities to buy and sell.
2. S&amp;P500 index is not suitable for ""buying high and selling low"" (**""Timing the market"" strategy**), because in general is quite stable (as it is intended and regulated to be!) and there is little opportunity for playing around with ""peaks"" and ""bottoms"". Therefore, confirming the pro DCA strategy argument in [**Timing the market: The absolute worst vs absolute best vs slow and steady**](https://np.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/).

[Chart: Bitcoin price \(absolute values, 2017-2022\) and S&amp;P500 Index \(absolute values, 2017-2022\). Data source: Google Finance, 29 March 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/hb66gmoluaq81.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc878d2c59cb99af7b8a8732d795bc1f550acc9)

In this simulation I am going to argue that there are scenarios in which **""Timing the market"" strategy** can be sometimes effective for crypto assets (due to their lesser regulation, easier access and therefore high price volatility. I will list different variations of this strategy and I will refer to it as **""Sell high, buy low"" strategy** (with different amounts of risk, ""timing the market"" precision - from realistic to almost perfect) and I will compare it to a strategy which consists of stable asset farming via DeFi (Decentralized finance) services, such as crypto asset lending (for interest), liquidity farming and etc. Please note that mixture of strategies (e.g. 50% ""DeFi Farming"", 50% ""Sell high, Buy low"") are not included. Rather than that, all strategies are presented in isolation.

# Strategies overview:

● **Strategy 0: HODL:** The asset is held passively inside a crypto wallet. No coin interest is gained. Upon market exit, the valuation is simply the market price.

● **Strategy 1: DeFi farming:** As explained already, this strategy consists of accumulating gains on the asset principal via various Decentralized finance methods. There are many different (with regard to reward and risk ratios) DeFi farming methods. For the purpose of this simulation I will consider the case of Bitcoin (BTC) with **18% APR** compound interest earned quarterly (meaning, the interest compounds 4 times per a year).

● **Strategy 2: Realistic - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 10k diff:** This strategy assumes **one sale** and and **one purchase** per period. The trade profit is generated via a **price difference of 10 000 USD**. Probability of practical execution: **Very realistic**.

● **Strategy 3: Realistic - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 20k diff:** This strategy assumes **one sale** and and **one purchase** per period. The trade profit is generated via a **price** **difference of 20 000 USD**. Probability of practical execution: **Somewhat realistic**.

● **Strategy 4: Medium - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 30k diff:** This strategy assumes **one sale** and and **one purchase** per period. The trade profit is generated via a **price** **difference of 30 000 USD**. This strategy assumes the same ""bottom"" purchase price as **Strategy 2** and **Strategy 3**, but the ""peak"" sell price is 30 000 USD above ""bottom"" purchase price. Therefore, this Strategy assumes ""high price volatility"". Probability of practical execution: **Medium to Hard**.

● **Strategy 5: Medium -  1 x ""Sell lower, Buy lower"" @ 30k diff:** This strategy is quite interesting. It's the same as **Strategy 4: Medium - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 30k diff**, but the difference is that both the purchase and sell trades are executed at **10 000 USD lower** than the previous strategy. This strategy tries to simulate the behavior of wary investors who ""sell early"" (perhaps even before the all-time-high), but then also buy a lower ""bottom"". In essence, it tries to visualize why it is important to purchase an asset at a lower price, than focusing on selling on a higher price. Probability of practical execution: **Hard**.

● **Strategy 6: Aggressive -  2 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 20k diff:** This strategy assumes **two sales** and **two purchases** per period. Each trade is executed at a **price difference of 20 000 USD**. This strategy somewhat highly unlikely market conditions (but which are not totally unrealistic) and suggests very aggressive trading and risk-taking. Probability of practical execution: **Very** **hard**.

# Simulation data used:

● *Initial capital:* All strategies assume that that the simulation starts with asset holding of **1.00 BTC** on **01 January 2022** and **0 USD**.

● *Trades per period:* Some strategies suggest **two purchases** (""BUY"") and **two sales** per one period (one calendar year), while the more ""realistic"" ones present simulation data only with **one purchase** and **one sale per period**.

● *Period's end capital:* Each period (year) ends with capital value in the form of fiat money (as each period ends with a sale of Bitcoin for fiat USD), but the estimated coin value is also included for information purposes.

● *Bitcoin average yearly price*: Naive estimations about yearly average BTC price history up to 2032 are made according to this chart\* (*Please see notes in the next section about why I chose not no to follow Plan B's stock-to-flow price model*):

|Period|Year|Estimated average Bitcoin price (USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2022|60 000|
|2|2023|70 000|
|3|2024|80 000|
|4|2025|90 000|
|5|2026|100 000|
|6|2027|110 000|
|7|2028|120 000|
|8|2029|130 000|
|9|2030|140 000|
|10|2031|150 000|
|11|2032|160 000|

● *Compounding interest note:* I want to make it clear for calculation purposes (from my observations) that the difference between annual compound interest (1 time per year) and quarterly (4 times per year) is not that significant, as we might expect. The interest earned is affected way more than the length of the compounding period (e.g. whether you are earning the interest for 1 or 5 years) and, of course, the interest rate itself. In essence, compound interest guarantees exponential growth of the returns after a certain ""interest rate threshold"" is passed. For me, personally, the threshold is between 5-10% and anything above that results in exponential gains or losses. See a compound interest graph [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qd19lozoqy).

# Notes on data used:

● *Bitcoin future average yearly data extrapolation:* Rather than using Plan B's prediction for 1 000 000 USD per 1 Bitcoin for year 2025, I have used a much more conservative and simpler approach. I took the average monthly price of Bitcoin for the past 8 years (reliable data is available only for the range of 2014-2022) and then I have taken the extrapolation as an average for the future 10 years (up to 2032). I understand that a lot of people will disagree with this simplification. My only defense points are that this price simulations suggest a more conservative price of Bitcoin (as it does not take into effect dollar inflation, and more importantly, the two halvings of Bitcoin in 2024 and 2028, which - historically - always ""sky rocket"" the price few months after they are introduced). It's always better to base your future estimations on conservative projects, as anything better than that it always welcome.

*● Stock-to-Flow model not used*: Yes, as you have noticed, this chart does not follow the famous [**Plan B's Stock-to-Flow model**](https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/stock-to-flow/), which suggests an exponential growth of Bitcoin price and a price of up to 1 000 000 USD per Bitcoin until year 2025. I don't do it, for two reasons:

1. First, because Stock-to-Flow model has been greatly challenged during 2021-2022 and there's simply not enough scientific support (I'm not talking Twitter mentions, but real peer-reviewed science) for the model. I can claim with the same success and verbiage that ""my model is identical"". The only difference is that I fully acknowledge that this model is pure simulation. Perhaps a secondary edition of this simulation can be done with this Stock-to-Flow price model.
2. I'm personally realistic about the actual market capitalization needed, in order to make Bitcoin reach 100 000 USD or even more. According [this](https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/stock-to-flow/) Coindesk analysis ([**The Complete Case for $100K Bitcoin**](https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/stock-to-flow/)), the market cap of Bitcoin needs to reach **9 trillion USD** (2% of current global wealth) or the price of **428 000 USD per Bitcoin** in order to reach the same capitalization as Gold (thus, really becoming *""Digital gold""*). In simpler terms, Bitcoin market capitalization needs to increase 10 times so it can be on equal terms with gold. As of today, 28 March 2022, Bitcoin market cap as is **904 billion USD** and total crypto market cap (the worth of all cryptocurrencies combined) is **2.16 trillion USD** (Source: [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com)).

● *Initial purchase price for January 2022:* The purchase price for the first period (January 2022) does not conform the linear growth of the prices for the next periods by \~10 000 USD for the most strategies. If this had to be done, the purchase price must have been 30 000 USD, which meant starting with faulty data from the beginning. I decided to keep 40 000 USD, because this was a relatively stable average price during the first quarter of 2022.

*● Coin valuation in the end of the period:* The last coin valuation (in December 2023) for the majority of the strategies shows no increase in coin value. This is because the actual ""coin value increase"" is achieved when a purchase (with the accumulated USD capital) is done during the first window opportunity in the next year.

# Simulation:

All strategies - except Strategy 0 - are applied for a 11 year period , from 2022 to 2023. For each strategy all trades are presented in the ""Trades"" graph for each year. All earnings (or losses) are reinvested immediately in the next period. Google Sheets is used to handle all data.

# Results:

Below are the results from running all 6 strategies with an initial capital of **1.00 Bitcoin** from **01 January 2022** (average Bitcoin price: **40 000 USD**) until **31 December 2032** (extrapolated average Bitcoin price: **160 000 USD**).

**0. Strategy 0: HODL**

This strategy involves no trading or moving assets outside of the wallet of the investor. Included for information purposes only, so the final period valuation can be compared to the other strategies.

**1. Strategy 1: DeFi Farming: Earn constant 18% APR per year**

This strategy relies on constant interest rate gains of 18% per year (compounded 4 times annually), with the interest gains reinvested immediately. Notice that after 4 years the capital (in coin value) is doubled (**2.02 BTC**) and after 5 more years doubled again (**4.09 BTC**).  No trading or market timing required.

[Chart: Strategy 1 - DeFi Farming: Investment results.](https://preview.redd.it/s25m4wqvpbq81.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42ccb6cab7c8a700616fa2439915c0b575c54661)

**2. Strategy 2: Realistic - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 10k diff per year**

This strategy requires the investor to make one successful cycle of ""Sell high, Buy low"" per year with a profit margin of **10 000 USD**.

Please note that for year 2022 the coin value (**0.86 BTC**) is only a representation of the dollar amount present in the account in the end of the year (because the trade has started in January with a capital of 1.00 BTC in coin, which is sold in May at the price of 60 000 USD, leaving the trader with 60 000 USD in cash, which in the end of the year (if the price is still 60 000 USD), equals 0.86 BTC).

It is evident that since the trade margin of 10 000 USD is below a profitability threshold, the investor actually is better off simply holding the asset without trading in this case.

**3. Strategy 3: Realistic - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 20k diff per year**

When the previous strategy is modified with an increased trade margin of **20 000 USD** between the purchase and sale price, **linear profitability** is actually achieved. In simpler terms, if a trader manages to execute a trade one trade with a margin of 20 000 USD, he is guaranteed a **20%** increase on his principal up until the Bitcoin price reaches 160 000 USD.

This strategy is quite realistic to achieve and provides a good balance of risk versus complexity and profitability. Still, compared to Strategy 1 (with annual interest of 18%), this approach is inferior.

[Chart: Strategy 3: Realistic - 1 x \\""Sell high, Buy low\\"" @ 20k diff: Investment results](https://preview.redd.it/6hp1zxx7wbq81.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6ed9193f198e243404678905706199697d11c33)

On an interesting mathematical note, this strategy is equal barely to a DeFi farming strategy with **\~11.5%** compound interest, which would leave the investor with **3.10 BTC** in the last period (year 2032). Therefore, an investor who earns less than **11%** on this lended/staked assets might really would be better of considering switching from DeFi farming to the trading tactic of Strategy 3.

[Chart: Strategy 3 is quite similar to a DeFi farming strategy with an interest rate of 11.5&amp;#37; APY.](https://preview.redd.it/by7b9xu6ogq81.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8f8ab51a0927767b1dec17e80d92b9c64d2908)

**4. Strategy 4: Medium - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 30k diff per year**

This is an advanced strategy which relies on the assumption that the market will be volatile enough (with one distinct bear and bull market per year) to allow the execution of one trade with a **30 000 USD** profitability margin annually.

This trading strategy provides **exponential profitability** increase due to the higher execution risk and price margins.

[Chart: Strategy 4: Medium - 1 x \\""Sell high, Buy low\\"" @ 30k diff: Investment results](https://preview.redd.it/a5kuyjmbwbq81.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f236e4a8804abba23b57062330791f2b9e25f835)

On a mathematical note again, this strategy is roughly equal to a DeFi farming strategy with a guaranteed interest yield of **\~22%** per annum (please note that in the chart the final year value for DeFi is the already compounded yearly value, while for Strategy 4 the coin value does not reflect the potential sale which would occur in January 2033, which would provide the new coin value).

[Chart: Strategy 4 is quite similar to a DeFi farming strategy with an interest rate of 22&amp;#37; APY.](https://preview.redd.it/tvcga231tgq81.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e8de68eb74f69bfb576d11bbe99fec08284a4d5)

**5. Strategy 5: Medium -  1 x ""Sell lower, Buy lower"" @ 30k diff per year**

This strategy is a modification of **Strategy 4**. It assumes that each sale would occur in a price point **10 000 USD lower** than the one in **Strategy 4**, and that each sale will also be executed at **10 000 USD lower**. It illustrates the notion that it is better to buy an asset at a cheaper price and sell it cheaper, rather than trying to buy at a higher price and wait for an even higher sales price, while still maintaining the same absolute margin in dollar price.

Notably, this strategy outperforms Strategy 4, despite selling at lower price peaks.

[Chart: Strategy 5: Medium -  1 x \\""Sell lower, Buy lower\\"" @ 30k diff: Investment results](https://preview.redd.it/jfh5nxukwbq81.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=884ce4adc3715958ba353ed7c9e687b6fcfb2713)

**6. Strategy 6: Aggressive -  2 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 20k diff per year**

This is the most aggressive strategy which assumes high market volatility. It relies on the execution of two trades per year with a profitability margin of 20 000 USD each. It provides exponential profitability. A very rough and quite inaccurate parallel of this strategy with a compound interest rate would be a number in the range of \~40% per annum.

# Interpretations and conclusions:

The most profitable strategy (if all the stars align and executed flawlessly) is **Strategy 6 (Aggressive -  2 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 20k diff per year),** which is exponentially profitable and relies on active trading (at least 2 cycles of ""Sell high, buy low"") per year. In the end this strategy suggests a holding of **39.38 BTC** (**3833% increase**). It suggests nearly **4 times better returns** than the second best strategy. There is a high probability of capital loss during trading. Risk rating: **Extreme**.

The second most profitable approach is **Strategy 5 (Medium - 1 x ""Sell lower, Buy lower"" @ 30k diff per year)**. This strategy gets its profitability from the huge profit margin which it seeks (static 30 000 USD difference between ""purchase"" and ""sell"" price) and the fact it tries to aim always at the ""lower"" version of a ""bottom"" and ""peak"" than **Strategy 4**. It provides, slower exponential capital growth. Requires advanced trading expertise, but does not seem ""completely impossible"" (since it requires execution only twice yearly and keeps the same 30 000 USD margin, while the price increases). High probability of partial capital loss. In the end this strategy suggest a holding of **10.50 BTC** (**950% increase**). Risk rating: **Medium High to High.**

In third place, while mathematically **Strategy 4** (**Medium - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 30k diff per year**) is slightly ahead of **Strategy 1** (**DeFi Farming: Earn constant 18% APR per year**) with just **1.04 BTC more** provided as a return (and a total capital increase of **586%** versus **482%**). However, due to the fact that **Strategy 1** is nearly almost safe and requires no trading at all, we have to consider here for the DeFi farming strategy to be the third most optimal (an almost also most profitable strategy too). Also, the chief difference is that while the profitability of **Strategy 4** (and all other strategies except **Strategy 1**) relies entirely on the assumption that either the price will increase, or either - at least - it will keep fluctuating, so trades are made possible, **Strategy 1** does not rely on price at all. Most importantly, as Bitcoin reaches its theoretical market cap it is (theoretically) suggested that the ""exponential increase"" of the profits (which is observed in the ""Sell high, Buy low"" strategies) will fade, while the effect of compound interest and its exponential increase will likely take effect exactly at that moment, providing exponential returns to the long-term holders. In the end  Strategy  2 (DeFi Farming) **guarantees** a holding of **5.82 BTC** (**482% increase**) without any trading. Risk rating: **Very low to None.**

The penultimate most profitable trading approach is **Strategy 3** (**Realistic - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 20k diff per year**) which - surprisingly - unlike other active trading strategies **provides only a linear increase on the capital**, due to the fact that every time a trade with a margin of 20 000 USD is executed, as the price increases, the profit margin is actually less (since it's way more profitable to invest, for example 100 000 USD in Asset A while it's worth 0.10 USD and sell it at price 0.20 USD, than buying it at 0.90 USD and selling at 1.00 USD). Also this strategy performs worse than the **Strategy 1** (**DeFi Farming**), while still carrying the risks associated with trading. It is outperformed even by the default passive **Strategy 0** (**HODL**). Risk rating: **Not worth it.**

The worst strategy is **Strategy 2** (**Realistic - 1 x ""Sell high, Buy low"" @ 10k diff per year**). While, visibly, this strategy suggests a short-term profit while executing a seemingly ""profitable"" trade with a margin of 10 000 USD, the reality is that as the asset price increases this profit margin is simply a mere illusion. **Most importantly, this strategy leads to actual loss in coin value**. While theoretically - in dollar value - the trader still indeed makes profits, simply holding the asset (and making no trades while) would be even more profitable. This leaves the important conclusion that all trading strategies must have critical profitability thresholds, which if not measured and attained, might result in falsely perceived positive profitability trading.

# Possible future work:

*●* *Recalculate the simulation with price extrapolation which takes into account the two Bitcoin halvings in 2024 and 2028 and modify current price model accordingly.*

*● Recalculate the simulation with on a price extrapolation based on the Stock-to-Flow model.*

*●* *Linear versus Logarithmic price extrapolation: A*s some commenters have suggested, rather than applying a linear extrapolation, perhaps a logarithmic one would be more realistic. Arguments for that (thanks to u/find_your_moon for pointing out) include increased institutional adoption which would decrease volatility, therefore reducing trading margin windows, and more importantly, as BTC reaches its (theoretical) maximum market cap, the price will increase in a slower manner as well. I am personally optimistic that based on the calculations of total global wealth (and trends data supplied by World Bank) is quite fair to ""simulate"" some ""more realistic"" projections. In fact, perhaps this is exactly what investment bankers and consultants n institutions such as JP Morgan, Monitor Deloitte, Gartner or Rand corporation have been trying to do over the past decade. Perhaps it is a good idea to read their insight (however biased and ""bearish"" they might be), since valuable technical analysis could be gathered from their experience (which of course, historically, is not always right). That's why one must always do his/her own research.

CryptoCurrency,"If the war in Ukraine was to end in the next couple weeks, it wouldn't just add fuel to this bull fire, it would add napalm...in the unlikely event it would end quickly.","More importantly it would end the war crimes, and bring peace.

But this is a crypto sub, so I'm just gonna talk about the crypto market side.

# The four horsemen of uncertainty.

Markets have been getting pounded with uncertainty for several months. Both crypto and stocks. From Omicron, Evergrande, the Fed hikes, and topped by the war in Ukraine with threats of nuclear war.

The war was the black swan event, and the red line Putin crossed that no one expected would be crossed. And sent a shockwaves of uncertainty for markets.

It's the big black cloud holding back markets.

But now Omicron is fading from the news. Evergrande defaulted last December. The Fed hike roadmap is set.

The last big horseman of uncertainty is the war in Ukraine.

If that were to end, it would not only lift economic strain for the world, but also a lot of uncertainty for markets.

Crypto markets have been doing pretty well despite the war. But if that extra black cloud would be gone, it would remove a lot of the remaining doubts and cut down some pretty big chains holding back the price.

It could potentially catapult crypto prices.

# But is it  even realistic to expect the war to end in the next couple weeks?

Not really. Probably not even in the next few weeks. It's not the most likely scenario.

The more likely scenario is for at least months of a long drawn out conflict of attrition, with neither side being able to reach an acceptable finality. Not until eventually time will bring a breaking point.

As bad as the Russian army is doing, there's no way Putin is gonna back down. He need at least some semblance of a victory.

There's still plenty of hardware and man power he can send in. Although, a lot of the Russian hardware in reserve is not combat ready, and has been poorly maintained and rusting away.

One way the war could end prematurely is if Putin ""accidentally"" fell from a balcony. But a coup isn't that easy to pull off. And Putin is overly cautious about this. Plus, there isn't anyone or any group really well placed to do this.

While the Russian constitution does allow to impeach a President, the process is too complicated, and would require parts of the government that are full of Putin supporters to agree to this.

A more realistic way the war could end, is if Russia moves the goal post to something small and more attainable, such as occupying just the Donbas region. While underneath the agreement, Putin could ask for the one thing he really wants, cutting down the cost of transferring oil through Ukraine. And that may be enough of a victory for him. But Ukrainians may not be so quick to give up either one.

Keep in mind, Putin can easily lie to his people, and claim victory either way. So the Russians television could still paint a small insignificant victory, as something bigger than it is.

A quick end is still less likely, but not completely impossible.

If you want crypto to go sky high, call your local Russian Oligarch, and send them the code word ""putsch the Put"".

In all seriousness, this conflict really needs to end either way.",cryptocurrency,1648569089.0

personalfinance,Sell starter home for equity or keep and rent,"Need some perspective/advice on current situation. My wife and I (30&amp;29) are looking to move into a larger home to grow our family. Current home is a 3/2 ~ 1600 sqft in the Austin metro area. I recently cash out refinanced my home to take advantage of some of the massive equity gains recently and to give us money for a potential down payment (5%) on a new home while keeping our starter as a rental. 

We’ve been looking for 4 months and have had little to no luck finding a home in the price range we were hoping for or have been outbid and don’t have the cash to compete. In that time we have slowly expanded our budget. Now we’re in a situation where we feel like we may be overextending unless we sell our existing home to roll the equity and reduce the monthly payments. Couple that with rising interest rates and those potential monthly payments keep growing. 

The home we are looking at (new build spec home that we are first on the wait list for)is 635k with a mortgage around 4500 a month as it stands right now. With 20% down we’re looking at around 3700. Based on our finances would it be wise to keep the starter as a rental and stretch our budget to reap the benefits of the explosive and projected appreciation in the area? Worst case scenario I sell it a few years down the line and clear all the other recurring debt.

Current Mortgage : $2050 
Approximate Equity: $120k

personalfinance,Does it make sense to buy a larger home at our age in light of increasing interest rates and super high inflation?,"Current home is a tad small for our liking but we have a very manageable mortgage that will be paid off in 13 years (OG term was 30 year amortization). All house related debt can be serviced on a single income.

Was thinking of selling current home and taking on a mortgage that is 2.4x our current mortgage amount but we're worried that debt servicing would be really high AND we're not sure if it makes sense to invest in a big home now to enjoy (early 40's) or should we stay the course, pay off home and then invest our money into the markets in hopes that it will gain more wealth over time but at the sacrifice of us living in a much tighter space?

Home prices as of recent has exploded and since we're in the housing market already that really the net difference is probably the same for the new place as it would've been a year ago. Our house has gone up but so has every house around us.

Our biggest fear is taking on way too much mortgage debt (over $600k which we were told by the banks that we could manage) and rising interest rates and energy prices + inflation of everything else scares me a lot.

What would the folks here consider in a potential house move that I may not have considered? I already know the new home will cost more to insure, more to maintain and more taxes so that's already been factored in. Long story short I know the new place will eat up a lot of free cash and my lifestyle will absolutely need to pivot to be able to ensure we don't ever run out of money to pay for home. Other consideration is how long the mortgage will be... I'm basically starting all over again and the home if amortized monthly would be paid off by the time I'm 67!

personalfinance,Looking for help with cash out refinance on existing HELOC,"I'll try to provide as many details as I about to see what the best options might be..

I live at home with my mom ever since my dad passed 8 years ago. We are both very ignorant and clueless to our options and processes as my dad primarily handled all the finances.

Currently we have a variable rate HELOC through Bank of America that we opened when he passed. It's been open for about 8 years and we have been only paying interest. Payments are around $450/month and don't include any property taxes of homeowners insurance which is estimated around $700/month for those.

Our balance is $160,000. Currently our property is valued around $300,000. Our HELOC is directly tied to the federal interest rate from what I've been told and has been steadily increasing over the last couple months and I know will keep going up.

We have about $25,000 in credit card debt between the two of us. Currently we have been offered a fixed rate 30 year including our property taxes which are approx $7000 a year and Homeowners insurance which is around $1400 per year. The rate is 4.99 and payment is $1700 per month. 

This amount includes the $160,000 we owe on the HELOC and an additional $35,000 to pay high interest debt and pay closing costs.

As far as the debt consolidation, as an example our highest single balance is $14,000 and 24% interest. Does it make sense to include something like this in the cash out refi even though the interest rate is only 5%, it is now stretched 30 years compared to an unsecured debt consolidation loan which could be payed off in 3-4 years.

We're totally stressed about the whole situation and don't know if the person who is offering the loan is working in our best interest or not, so I figured I'd come to the wonderful and helpful world of reddit.

The payments are very manageable, but the removing the MIP could free up about $150/mo, which is a significant amount of money, especially considering my daughter being due in June. My girlfriend and I are both on the deed, but our credit isn't much better than when we closed.

Considering closing costs, a renewed amortization schedule,  federal interest rates quickly rising, what do you folks think about when/if I should refinance? Is there a cost-benefit formula I can find online? Is there any additional information I need to consider?",finance,1648584345.0
personalfinance,reduce taxable income -401k/IRA,"Hi guys, 

I'm not sure on how thorough I am suppose to be, but I'm looking for some direction on 401ks/IRAs. 

I have an IRA from a previous employer that I completely forgot about, like from five years ago.. It has been sitting and accumulating funds. 

WIth my current employer, I have a 401K plan that I contributed 6k into last year. I'm not planning on withdrawing or anything. If anything I may increase my 401k contributions for 2022 to reduce my total taxable income.

Is there anything I can do between these two accounts for 2021 tax incentives? I know with ROTHS, you can pick to apply a deposit to a previous year or current. 

BUT please tell me if this is correct - 

My understanding is that moving my IRA account funds into a ROTH IRA, that will cause a taxable event. Is there any way I can move my current IRA to benefit my tax situation? I started to file my taxes and I'm estimated to owe 5k in federal. My W2 shows 153k (after removing my 6k 401 contribution) - File single and no dependents. In the USA if that matters 

Does it make more sense to just deposit some money from my savings directly into a ROTH for 2021 instead of touching either account?",finance,1648587987.0

personalfinance,Letter from the IRS?,"I always help my mom with taxes every year and generally use TurboTax. She is elderly and has a pretty simple return. I already e-filed her taxes for her for 2021 and did so several weeks ago.

Today she called saying she got a letter from the IRS which appears to say nothing along with a voucher which simply says, ""Cut out and return the voucher below if you have an inquiry or response. Do not use if you are making a payment.""

The letter basically just says if you have questions about this letter, call the appropriate telephone number listed below.

It goes on to list several numbers for individual wage earners, self-employed/business owners, etc. It also says you can write to the address at the top of the page and then talks about e-filing and suggests to e-file in the future if you didn't this time (which we did).

How weird.

Anyone seen anything like this before? The letter makes no demands, lists no unresolved issues, and the voucher has no payment info listed as due (she owed no federal taxes). 

Not quite sure if and how to respond to something like this.

Any thoughts?",finance,1648589241.0

CryptoCurrency,Hackers Steal $540 Million in Crypto From ‘Axie Infinity’ Game [WSJ],"A cryp­tocur­rency startup that op­er­ates a pop­u­lar on­line game called “Axie In­fin­ity” said Tues­day that hack­ers stole more than $500 mil­lion worth of cryp­tocur­rency.

“Axie In­fin­ity” pub­lisher Sky Mavis Ltd. said on March 23, hack­ers in­fil­trated a part of its Ronin Net­work, which the game runs on. The in­fil­tra­tors got ac­cess to ac­counts hold­ing cryp­tocur­ren­cies and drained 173,600 ether and 25.5 mil­lion of the sta­ble­coin USDC.

“The breach hap­pened due to so­cial en­gi­neer­ing, not tech­ni­cal flaw,” said Alek­sander Larsen, op­er­at­ing chief and co-founder of Sky Mavis. While users are now un­able to with­draw or de­posit funds to Ronin Net­work, he said Sky Mavis is com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing that all of the drained funds are re­cov­ered or re­im­bursed.

It was the sec­ond-largest crypto hack ever, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lyt­ics firm El­lip­tic. The as­sets were worth about $540 mil­lion on the date of the theft and are worth about $615 mil­lion now.

Sky Mavis shared a link that shows the stolen funds are still in the hack­er’s wal­let. The firm said it is work­ing with the an­a­lyt­ics firm Chainal­y­sis to track the stolen funds. The news didn’t have a big im­pact on the price of ether, which was down 0.65% at $3,395.20 at 5 p.m. ET.

“We are work­ing di­rectly with var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies to en­sure the crim­i­nals get brought to jus­tice,” Ronin said in the state­ment. “We are in the process of dis­cussing with Axie In­fin­ity/Sky Mavis stake­hold­ers about how to best move for­ward and en­sure no users’ funds are lost.”

The hack comes as a blow to the crypto in­dus­try as it moves into the main­stream with Wall Street buy-in, celebrity en­dorsers and high-pro­file Su­per Bowl ads. The fed­eral gov­ern­ment is still weigh­ing fur­ther reg­u­la­tions of digi­tal as­sets.

“Axie In­fin­ity,” launched in 2018, is part of a small but fast-grow­ing num­ber of so-called play-to-earn games. Also known as blockchain games, they largely cen­ter on the buy­ing, trad­ing and sell­ing of vir­tual as­sets backed by non­fun­gi­ble to­kens, or NFTs. The games are con­sid­ered an early foray into the meta­verse, a more im­mer­sive fu­ture ver­sion of the in­ter­net where peo­ple are ex­pected to work, learn and be en­ter­tained.

“Axie In­fin­ity” had more than 1.7 mil­lion daily users in Feb­ruary, ac­cord­ing to Sky Mavis. In it play­ers col­lect digi­tal pets called Ax­ies that they use to com­pete in bat­tles. They can sell and trade the crea­tures for digi­tal cur­rency. Some Ax­ies are worth more than oth­ers.

Many de­vel­op­ers of earn-to-play games are star­tups, but some of the game in­dus­try’s large, pub­licly traded com­pa­nies have re­cently be­gun ex­per­i­ment­ing in the cat­e­gory, in­clud­ing “Far­m­Ville” maker Zynga Inc. and “As­sas­sin’s Creed” cre­ator Ubisoft En­ter­tain­ment SA.

Some in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tives have raised con­cerns about the se­cu­rity and value of NFTs in games, such as Mi­crosoft Corp. gam­ing chief Phil Spencer and the head of “Fort­nite” maker Epic Games Inc., Tim Sweeney. Many gamers also are skep­ti­cal of the trend and worry that earn-to-play merely rep­re­sents a cash-grab op­por­tu­nity for de­vel­op­ers.

The de­cen­tral­ized na­ture of crypto plat­forms, added with the oft­times in­ex­pe­ri­ence of the de­vel­op­ers of those plat­forms, leaves plenty of vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in­side the code for hack­ers to ex­ploit. Since 2011, there have been 226 hack­ing in­ci­dents—not in­clud­ing the “Axie In­fin­ity” hack—that have led to the theft of $12.1 bil­lion, re­search firm Crys­tal Blockchain es­ti­mates.

In 2021, there were a record 75 in­ci­dents that re­sulted in $4.25 bil­lion be­ing stolen, ac­cord­ing to the firm. The largest crypto hack was in Au­gust 2021, when a DeFi pro­to­col called Poly­Net­work lost as­sets worth $611 mil­lion at the time of the hack.

One of the high­est-pro­file hacks was the 2016 break-in of Bitfinex, which re­sulted in a loss of about $70 mil­lion worth of bit­coin at the time. In Feb­ruary, FBI agents seized the ma­jor­ity of the stolen funds, which had surged to a value of about $3.6 bil­lion, and charged a Man­hat­tan cou­ple with laun­der­ing the stolen funds.",cryptocurrency,1648592761.0

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance/Consolidation Advice/Help,"\*\*\*FIRST REDDIT POST\*\*\*

I am in a massive rut. I've been looking for any advice/help with the consolidation of student loans I have. I currently have two (2) previously consolidated loans; one federal (through Mohela), and one private \[through Laurel Road (on behalf of Mohela)\] and I cannot seem to get any help/success with combining the two into one or even being able to refinance them together for a decent rate. 

As of this month, I owe a little bit above $75k and am set to pay around $700 a month starting after the COVID forbearance ends this May. I have been paying $435 a month (private loan) for a few years now, but would like to be able to not have such a high monthly payment. I realize that I will have to pay school loans for the rest of my life and I've come to terms with it, so a high interest and/or an extraordinary principle is expected. But still, no agency will even give me a rate/chance (I've tried Laurel Road, SoFi, Credible, my bank, and Citizens so far).

I currently still live with my parent and still have separate bills to pay, but fortunately do not have to pay rent (thanks mom!). I've been trying to buy a house for over a year now, and with the $700 a month payments coming up, it's impossible to house hunt and even be able to qualify for a house loan. I make about 56k annually but I'm not sure that with a better paying job, if I'd be able to refinance still. However, I really just don't know. 

I've been trying to figure out what I can do and why I cannot get help from anyone, and I am at the end of the rope. 

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1648600987.0

personalfinance,Buying a house. Should I disclose to the lender that I am getting a new job that pays more than my current one?,"I am currently in the underwriting phase of buying a new home.  The estimated total monthly cost of the mortgage will be about 25% of our monthly income as reported on our 2021 taxes.  However, both my wife and I will be seeing a jump in income for 2022 since she started her current job in April of 2021, and I am going to be starting a new job later this summer that is guaranteed to pay a significantly better monthly salary.  

I have been under the impression that disclosing a job change to the lender during the loan approval stage is not a good idea since it presents uncertainty.  However, this is a different story since I’ll be with my current job for several more months till after our closing date (04/12/22) and I’m guaranteed a higher salary once starting.  

I guess part of me is concerned the lender will reject our application since we are approaching 28% (which I was told is the cutoff for how much a mortgage can take up of one’s monthly income).  We put an offer on the house because of how much we liked it and the location, and also the fact that the fed was planning to raise rates and we had locked our rate in at 3.875%.  I also knew that I would be getting this new job with the pay bump and our math checks out that after the pay raise, the mortgage would then claim about 19% of our monthly income.

Last week my mom was called by someone who spoofed PG&amp;Es number, they threatened to shut her utilities off within 2 hrs if she didn't transfer them via zelle. Unfortunately she sent them 5 transfers each for a little under 500 each totalling 2500$.

We notified the bank on the same day via phone and dropped off the dispute forms the next day. My argument was that this was extortion, they scammed her by threatening to shut off her utilities. The bank did not see it that way and denied her request for reimbursement, citing that she authorized it and viewed the disclosures.

What recourse do we have, if any? Is my argument about this payment not being authorized due to the extortion the correct argument to make? Should I be saying this is an error instead?

Tomorrow the banks VP is going to call me. Any advise is appreciated, thank you!

***The bank fully reimbursed us after we cited regulation E on the advise of an attorney. Everyone saying this is not covered under Regulation E is not correct. It does not matter if it was authorized or not. The bank is required to start their investigation as soon as you call them about fraud.

personalfinance,Tax obligations when hiring in-home caretaker for hospice?,"My dad was in hospice care at home last year. I paid thousands of dollars out of pocket to hire a wonderful in-home caretaker to assist us in his 24 hour care. She worked 40 hours a week for 4 months. I hired her independently -- not under any kind of contract, nor through an agency. I paid her her agreed upon hourly wage -- plus a lump sum bonus because she was so wonderful. She invoiced me every week. And, yes, I was paying well above the minimum wage -- $25/hour.

Obviously, with my father dying, I wasn't really thinking about taxes. Next week, I'm going to be working with a CPA on preparing my taxes. But, it just occurred to me, I have no idea if I had any kind of obligations under federal or state law for ""payroll"" style taxes.

I have no idea if the caretaker files as an individual employee or contractor or under a business name. Frankly, I have no idea if she files at all. All of our payments were made via Zelle, in her name and I believe she deposited them in her personal checking account. I'm in the process of tallying up all of my out of pocket expenses associated with my dad's hospice and end of life care from last year (not just this lady's wages) and there's a very good chance it will add up to more than my standard deduction. In which case, I'll be working with my CPA to claim the expenses.

**Questions:**

1. What would you advise I look into before meeting with my CPA to determine if I would be liable to cover some type of payroll tax or benefit?
2. Could I cause the caretaker any type of headache with the IRS or the State of California by claiming my payments to her on my tax return?
3. Is there some kind of tax benefit I should have been factoring into her weekly Zelle payments?

In case it's of relevance, I'm a resident of Florida, but I took unpaid family medical leave to care for my dad in California for three months. The caretaker is, of course, a resident of California as well.

I do not have any kind of business entities. I'm just a regular employee in a corporate position back in Florida. My payments to her were coming directly from my personal checking account, via Zelle on a weekly basis.",finance,1648610242.0
personalfinance,Paying off student loans… is there something I’m not seeing?,"I’m a senior in college who’s set to graduate in may.

I took out a total of $7,500 in direct unsubsidized Stafford loans (federal) for the school year which have not accumulated interest because of Covid. 

I just got my tax returns and I currently have $18,675 in my savings+checking accounts. I really want to pay off these loans before graduation and just be done with it but is there something I’m missing? Like would this be a bad idea or should I just pull the trigger and go for it?

Other stuff worth mentioning: I’m working 24 hours a week at an internship making $17 an hour which will turn into 40 hours a week from the week I graduate until the beginning of July. If I don’t have full-time employment lined up by then I’ll go back to my old job at $16.25 (they were very clear they would take me back in the future) until I find a “big girl job”.

I'm interested in buying out the lease when it's finished because cars similar to mine are on the market for around $30k and according to my lease paperwork the buyout option at the end of the term is almost $16k. However, I've been struggling with how to find a buyout loan. The dealership has been contacting me nonstop about my car offered me a few loan options but they all amounted to $21k total. I asked for a breakdown on why it is so much higher than the buyout price and I got a three word email ""taxes and interest""... I call BS because the contract says the only fee is a $50 cost. I have good credit to get a low interest rate through a third party but the lease is through Chase and I'm confused if only the subaru dealership can get me the loan.

dealership may purchase leased vehicle. No other
third-party sales are permitted."" Does this mean I have to negotiate a loan amount with Subaru or Toyota etc.?

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14). There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union."" Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

56. Here’s some analysis of the EU MiCA draft language guessing that there’s a good chance it will pass today (March 14) but that it might be removed during “Trilogues” which will be the subsequent informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission.

CryptoCurrency,Inflationary and Deflationary Currency,"tldr; Inflationary - more supply over time, decreasing value.  Deflationary - less or stable supply over time, increasing value.  Each has its uses and reasons for existing, and neither is going away.  (And moons are good.)

It's very common in this forum for people to deride fiat for being inflationary and point out the superiority of deflationary crypto. It's not that simple though.

**What is Inflationary Currency? What is Deflationary Currency?**

In a nutshell, inflationary currency is currency that is designed to increase over time at a rate such that the value decreases over time. There can be market fluctuations, but the trend overall is to decrease in value. Most (all?) fiat currencies are intentionally inflationary.

Deflationary currency is the opposite. Supply is limited or even decreasing over time. There can be market fluctuations, but if the currency isn't abandoned en masse, the value will tend to increase over time. Many crypto currencies are intentionally deflationary.

**Why is fiat generally inflationary? (And why is that a good thing?)**

Fiat is usually managed with a goal of having 2-4% annual inflation. This is not accidental. Why is it this way?

1. Savings - For the overall economy, spending is encouraged. Spending results in more capital flows, keeps people employed, and generally keeps the economy moving. If $1 today can buy more tomorrow than it can today, the only people that will spend it are those that absolutely must. If people who don't have to spend don't spend, then people who rely on that spending for their livelihood lose their jobs.
2. General Investment - Having fiat be mildly inflationary encourages people with spare cash to invest it. Buy real property (land, house), buy portions of companies (stock), etc. These things also help keep the overall economy moving and healthy.
3. Finance (consumer) - If you buy a house or other major property, you want that property to grow in value over time. For most people, such purchases also require taking out a loan at some interest rate. If currency is inflationary, that investment in property, all else being equal, will grow as the currency inflates. The relative payment and interest will decrease over time, relative to income. If currency is deflationary, all else being equal, that property would lose value over time, and the interest and payment on the loan will grow relative to the value and possibly income. Rather than the house becoming both more affordable for the purchaser and more valuable over time, it may end up becoming unaffordable even if the purchaser’s fortunes don’t change.
4. Finance (producer) - Banks are willing to loan money to people because they generally know that they'll get it back, plus interest, and that just holding onto that money will result in having LESS money in the bank's coffers. If fiat were inflationary, banks would be unwilling to give out loans except at extremely high interest rates because they can make more by just retaining that money instead.

**But ... Inflation!**

When people complain about inflation, they're usually not complaining about the target 2-4% inflation, but HIGH inflation. Inflation above that 2-4% target.

If inflation is too high, then the price of everyday needs goes up faster than income, which results in a decrease in effective income over time. No one wants to be making more on paper, while being able to buy less.  Just like water, some inflation is good but too much and you drown.

**The role of central banks with Fiat**

Central banks have two primary jobs. One is to manipulate monetary policy in such a way that inflation stays within that 2-4% target range. The other is to dampen fluctuations in the value of fiat relative to goods in order to produce stable pricing. Fortunately, doing the former also usually accomplishes the latter.  Right now, the US economy is overheating - inflation is above 4%. So, the Federal Reserve is going to raise the interest rates that banks pay, and stop its bond purchases in an attempt to slow the economy some and bring inflation back in line. It has to do these things slowly in order to maintain stability in the currency. The concern with such changes, and what makes markets nervous, is that they will either do it too slowly or too quickly.

In terms of the overall stability of the society and financial markets and the investments of average Americans, this manipulation of fiat is a good thing. There are similar institutions in most other countries that do similar things for the same reasons.

**What about crypto?**

Many crypto are intentionally deflationary - designed to go up in value over time. That's what makes it such a great store of value, most especially Bitcoin.

Eth is an interesting case. It's actually inflationary, but has added burning based on the volume of transactions.  The more people use it, the more deflationary it becomes.

**But my Crypto went down in value this month!**

Perhaps, but most people here likely told you to HODL ... Because it will go back up, and probably go even higher. There's no central bank attempting to stabilize the price and rate of inflation or deflation, and being driven by human nature, it's an inherently unstable system. The overall trend over time is upward for deflationary assets though.

Is that lack of stabilization a good thing? In fiat, where one gets paid a fixed wage and has to buy goods to live, no. In crypto, used as an investment and trading opportunity, it can be a good thing, resulting in lots of opportunities to trade and get ahead (or ... not ...).

**Why is Bitcoin (specifically) not great as everyday currency?**

There are several reasons, and probably more than these.

1. If a rational person knows that a bitcoin is likely to be worth more tomorrow than it is today, they're not going to spend it unless they absolutely must. It simply works better as a store of value.
2. The volatility makes it such that companies, in order to continue paying their workers in fiat, would need to constantly adjust prices according to the current value. The instability of Bitcoin (and other crypto) value makes it difficult for companies to do this. Those that do accept Bitcoin will generally do an immediate conversion in price from fiat to Bitcoin. (E.g. You can buy X and pay in crypto. The cost will be crypto's current value relative to fiat. The price is really in fiat though.)
3. It has a bad image in some ways.  The difficulty of tracking transactions to an individual person made it attractive to criminals early on, and that reputation has stuck even as it has gained more legitimate usage.
4. It's new, different, etc... Yes, all of that too, but that's not really the topic of this.

**What about stablecoins?**

These stand the greatest chance of actually being used for commerce. (Keep in mind though, they're pegged to currencies that are controlled and managed by central banks! They gain their stability from the actions of those central banks.) They've not gained a lot of mindshare among the public though, and no doubt many would say, ""Why? What's the advantage of spending 1 USDC (or UST or DAI or whatever) vs 1 USD for something? It's the same thing."" The advantage is technological and philosophical, but most people don’t care about that and just want to spend X and get Y. They won't use stablecoins for such purchases until doing so is as seamless and straightforward as it is with fiat. The new crypto credit cards help move in this direction.

I love crypto as an investment opportunity. I love that I can trade relatively small amounts of it - amounts that are impractical with stocks. I also love that there are publicly available, and free, APIs that I can use to write my own automated trading bots. I love some of the technology. I also love the chance that, given the instability, I might get lucky and something might moon. Most of these things aren't true with stocks. Stocks are a lot less interesting. Buy something, wait passively ... Due to fees, day trading isn't practical unless one has a great deal of money. Crypto is a lot more active, engaging, and fun for those that don't have a huge amount of money to put into it. Most of my long term investments are in stock though.

This is not likely a popular opinion here, but I'm deeply skeptical of crypto in its current form being used as everyday currency. *However, it wouldn't surprise me to see new government-backed stablecoins built with blockchain technology being used for everyday currency.* These wouldn't be crypto as we know it though. They would be just as regulated and stabilized (and inflationary) as fiat is today.

personalfinance,Wealth Builder vs Debt Buster Strategy: which would you choose?,"I’ve been deliberating on a good financial strategy at this stage in my life and was curious of what others think may be the optimal strategy here. 

First, the breakdown: 35M working in tech, wife SAHM and grad student, one cute ass 3 month old formula-fed baby. 

Salary: $93K per year

Credit Score: 780

Net monthly take home: $5200

All recurring bills: $3200

Food/groceries: $1000

Roth IRA: $2,500

Cumulative 401K: $75,000



Savings/e-fund: $7000 ($80,000 credit limit and HELOC available if things got really hairy)

Leaves $1K each month for misc. I like to use $500 of that to save/invest/pay down debt each month. The other $500 is for whatever wife thinks we need. Using the debt snowball method I’ve paid off all high interest debts over the past year (&gt; 5%+ interest). 

Speaking of which, here are my debts:

Credit Card: $800, 0% APR until 02/2023

Furniture: $4800, 0% APR 04/2025

Car 1: $12,725, 2.5% APR @ $272 per month

Car 2: $16,167, 1.9% APR @ $338 per month

Mortgage: ~$250K @ 2.5% 30 years fixed. 

——————————

Now with all the fiscal stuff out of the way and having a feeling of contentment over putting out the major debt-related fires in our lives, I’m curious of the strategy to employ going forward to really lock in financial security long-term. 

I’ve devised two (fairly obvious) strategies that I would like to hear everyone’s thoughts on. Note, I am not currently contributing to my 401K (company matches 50% up to 4%— I pay $120, they pay $60 per pay period) or my Roth IRA which I had to nearly empty to pay my property taxes this past year due to not properly funding the escrow, which I have now fixed going forward. 

**Strategy 1: Debt Buster** (Snowball Method):

Goal: Free up $816 extra per month by Nov 2025

* Pay off 0% CC: ($800) - 100 - 04/2022

* Pay off furniture ($4,844) - 106 - 01/2023

* Pay down Car 1 ($12,975) - 272 - 12/2024

* Pay down Car 2 ($16,481) - 338 - 11/2025

By November 2025 I could be completely free of debt except mortgage by rolling previous debt payments into next one, freeing up $816 extra plus my initial $500 per month = $1316 per month extra to invest with once all these debts are cleared. 

**Strategy 2: Wealth Builder**

Goal: Since existing debts are at extremely low interest rates, focus on building larger savings and investments for long-term. How?

* Build up emergency fund higher (3-6 months)

* Turn on 401K contributions again up to match

* $500 per month into Roth IRA, fully fund difference before tax season lapses. 

Those are the two best strategies I could come up with. Any thoughts or advice is welcome. I’m genuinely curious of what others think of my situation and what strategy they would consider optimal",finance,1648639707.0

stocks,"Companies added 455,000 jobs in March, slightly more than expected, ADP says","Companies added jobs at a solid pace in March,  indicating that hiring is strong despite signs of a tightening labor  market, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.

Private  payrolls expanded by 455,000 for the month, the firm said, about in line  with the Dow Jones estimate of 450,000 though it was the lowest since  August 2021. The total was slightly below the upwardly revised 486,000  in February, and brought ADP’s first-quarter jobs count to 1.45 million.

The  report comes two days before the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls  report, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics expected to show jobs growth  of 490,000 for the month, according to the Dow Jones consensus  estimate. The ADP and BLS numbers can differ widely, as they did in  February when the payrolls firm’s count was about 200,000 below the  government’s official tally.

ADP’s report for March indicated that  hiring was spread evenly around sectors, with leisure and hospitality  adding 166,000 to lead the way. Education and health services  contributed 72,000 while professional and business services was next  with 61,000 new jobs.

On the goods-producing side, manufacturing led with 54,000 while construction added 15,000.

Service-providing companies added 377,000 jobs while goods producers made up the balance of about 79,000.

By  size, job gains also were spread fairly evenly, with companies  employing 50 to 499 workers up 188,000 and large companies adding  177,000. Small business, which saw a decline in February, reversed that  and added 90,000 in March.

“Businesses  are hiring, specifically among the service providers which had the most  ground to make up due to early pandemic losses,” said Nela Richardson,  chief economist at ADP. “However, a tight labor supply remains an  obstacle for continued growth in consumer-facing industries.”

Indeed, in February there were [a record 5 million more jobs](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/29/there-are-now-a-record-5-million-more-job-openings-than-unemployed-people-in-the-us.html)  than available workers, according to BLS data released Wednesday.  Workers continue to leave their jobs in search of better opportunities,  with 4.3 million more taking part in the so-called Great Resignation  during the month.

Friday’s report is expected to show the unemployment rate contracted further, to 3.7%.

Federal  Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as the central  bank battles inflation at 40-year highs. Job growth has come with a  sharp acceleration in wages, and the Fed is expected to raise interest  rates at a brisk pace this year to combat rising prices.

I’m putting down 20% on a 400k home. I’ve been considering 30yr loans till now. Interest rates seem to be around 5% for me with excellent credit. 

Question:
Is 30yr loan better or should I consider 15yr for now given it is around 1% lower on interest rate. I can afford payment on 15yr loan. I can always refinance to another 15 or even 30yr later if and when interest rates go down. 

Given the interest rates, would a ARM 7 be a good option? Again with the assumption that I’ll refinance to fixed in 5-7 years at a potentially lower interest rate. Is this assumption even reasonable?",finance,1648643142.0

# [Stock futures edge lower after Dow and S&amp;P 500 notch a fourth straight day of gains](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. equities futures dipped slightly Wednesday after stocks extended their rally in the previous session, even as fears of an inverted yield curve sparked recession concerns and investors continued watching developments play out in Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 95 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Russia said late Tuesday it would reduce its military presence in some parts of Ukraine, but several countries — including the U.S. and U.K. — remain skeptical over Moscow’s pledge. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Crude prices, which have soared since the war began, climbed more than 2% to $106.57 per barrel on Wednesday. Germany warned of potential rationing of natural gas due to disputes with Russia.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong session, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 positing their fourth straight day of gains on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8% in the previous session and now sits less than 10% from its record.
*****
&gt; “The market’s now up almost 10% in the last 10 days, so we’ve had a pretty incredible rally in a very short time with not a whole lot of news change except that we actually have more rate hikes priced into the market,” Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; “This has been a nice ride,” she added. “But I wouldn’t get too comfortable for the rest of this year, because I think we’re going to continue to see a lot of volatility.”
*****
&gt; Several retail stocks were under pressure in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly reports, including Five Below and Chewy.
*****
&gt; On the positive side, shares of chipmaker Micron rose 4% after the company beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Apparel stock Lululemon jumped 7% after issuing upbeat guidance and announcing a share buyback program.
*****
&gt; All eyes were on the bond market Tuesday as the U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasury yields inverted Monday for the first time since 2016. Historically, this inversion has been a sign of a coming recession, though it hasn’t been a good indicator of when the recession would come. Still, investors largely shrugged off the event.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the main yield spread traders watch, that between the 2-year and the 10-year rate, came close to inverting but stayed positive. On Wednesday, the spread climbed back to about 7 basis points.
*****
&gt; “The big talk right now is that at any given point in time, recession can be on the horizon,” Lang said. “Typically, you won’t see a recession for an average of 20 months once a yield curve inverts. Our antennas are up that recession risk is heightened; that doesn’t necessarily mean that there’ll be one this year, though next year is more of a concern for us.”
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching economic data scheduled to be released Wednesday, including economic growth data, home sales data and ADP’s national employment report.
*****
&gt; Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, will speak to the Economic Club of New York.

personalfinance,I’m feeling a lot of pressure to buy a house immediately rather than in a year…,"Long story short my partner and I sold our city condo about 9 months ago. It wasn’t a fun ride of ownership and we experienced a “last straw” experience that caused us to sell. So we went back to renting for a year to clear our minds before looking for a suburban cookie cutter home to raise a family in. We’ve enjoyed the breath of fresh air that comes with not being responsible for things breaking - I honestly think it’s been so good for my mental health - and I’ve been excited to rent downtown through the summer for my last summer living downtown. Two years ago Covid made the summer boring and this last year selling the condo was such chaos that I didn’t really get to experience the downtown summer either (walking to the museums, walking to the “beach”, lakefront biking, brunch dates… it’s my favorite time to live there)
With all of the talk of loan rates going up and what not, I’m feeling a large push to buy a house now now now! instead of waiting until the winter of this year or next spring, like was our plan. I don’t want to “not get a good deal” on my interest rate but at the same time I feel the push to buy now for exclusively that reason could be dangerous- I can identify that I don’t WANT to buy now - I want to get to experience my last summer downtown- and I can identify that feeling this pressure could even land us in another property that becomes a nightmare rather than a blessing- my husband is concerned with this one. Yet I still feel it because I’m the numbers person of the family- my feelings and the numbers just lead in different directions right now. Is anyone else also having this dilemma or has adultier advice? We’re 30, no kids yet but want to start trying soon. I don’t personally believe housing prices will go down really so I’m not willing to hold out on that idea.",finance,1648644385.0
personalfinance,How long will a debt collection affect my credit?,"To keep a long story short, in June of 2017 I received my first accusation of not returning my cable box by Cox Cable. My dad, who was with me when I returned it, said don’t pay the 300 they are asking. 

Went along since then, 5 years later I’m graduating medical school, considering getting a mortgage for a house as some properties are cheaper and safer to buy than rents in my city. However, my credit score is a 660 today. The collection isn’t always on my account as in September I opened a chase sapphire with a a score just under 800.

How long am I going to be stuck seeing Afni Collections pop up. Worried this will severely screw me over for interest rates and loans all because of the principle of 300 dollars. The collection popped back up on my score in December and sunk me 120 points.",finance,1648646867.0

I almost always receive a refund on both federal and state each year. Today I went ahead and selected exempt on my federal W4 and bumped my state allowances to 2(was at 1 for the past two years).

personalfinance,Changing mortgage terms (outside US),"I live in a European country with a near-zero federal interest rate. They’re saying they may raise the rate soon. I have a 30-year mortgage that is split into several separate loans, each having their own terms (number of months locked-in, interest rate and a discount on the interest rate). I’m not sure if this is how things are done in the US, but it’s standard here.

Some of the loan terms are expiring soon and switch to a 3-month, floating term, but I have the option to choose a different term. My options range from:
3-month at 1.27%
1 year at 1.73%
Up to a 6 year at 2.77%

At the end of each term, the interest rate is subject to change at the bank’s latest rates, but I have the same options in terms of length of the terms.

I’m not sure what the best option is now. Conventional wisdom tells me get the best rate for the longest period possible, but this becomes a trade-off of time vs rate and it seems impossible to predict what would be the best trade off in this case.

personalfinance,cash out vs HELOC? which is better.,"Hello,

We have been looking into refinancing our loan but can't decide which route to take. We currently have a 15 year at 3.37% interest rate it comes out to $1993 with escrow. We have already planned to refinance in two years to a 30 year loan since we bought our house in 2019. We currently have two options on the table right now.

Option 1
Normal refinance with possible HELOC
30 years
4.8% interest rate
$1567 w/escrow
HELOC - 109 with 25k limit and pull 10k out.

Option 2
Cash out refinance
30 years
5% interest rate
$1643 w/escrow

We're looking at building a fence here soon, which would cost us up to 10k, but most of all our major repairs needed have been paid out of pocket by us.

I know…this is great, my mom is 50 and dad 52. I recently found out that her 401k has 1.2 million in it, and she has a taxable account with less than 30k. And the scary part is she has 1.5 million in company stock that she works for, this company is a startup biotech aka extremely risky and may fail even though she has faith in it. If this company works out then that stock will be worth 5-10million but that is nowhere close to a guarantee. They also own a home worth about 1.8-2million with 1.2million equity. I quickly realized after talking to them that all they do in the market is max out her 401k, which she said I think was 27k a year!!! That is astounding to me, I would think she could be throwing an additional 100k a year. However, I found out a lot of their excess money is simply going in savings account which has like 150k in it right now and they are contributing 9-10k a month to the mortgage payment which the minimum payment is 4.2k with a 3% interest rate. I told them they should be making the minimum payment on the mortgage and dump a fuck ton into the markets and they will be doing so much better.

economy,Jumpstarting wealth for low income houses by offering extremely low interest rates for new construction,"*Low income HOUSEHOLDS, not houses


I had thought of a way to improve income inequality, for families in particular, by having governments work with builders to build condo complexes for low income residents in high COL areas. The condos would then be sold for a 200k-400k price tag, but then the government would offer 0% interest loans on these units with no down payment for the low income families such that low income families are paying about 500-1000 dollars a month in a mortgage but on pure principle. There would also be hardship protection meaning if the family lost it's income the mortgage payments could be temporarily suspended.,

This seems like a great approach because it will enable families to start building wealth immediately. It will give families a stake in their communities meaning that compared to subsidized housing projects, these units will be respected much more. There are a wide variety of side benefits too, but in particular it shouldn't be too expensive for the government except for the impact of inflation on the value of the loan. I think something like this would be way better than horrible housing projects that burn money and are absolutely horrible for residents.

I send GBP to Canada every month and the pound is getting absolutely hammered, it was 1.70 to the dollar (cad) now it's 1.64 to the dollar. What I don't understand is the UK economy is much larger than Canada so if both economies are suffering (through Russia's actions and inflation) should the GBP not be more resistant to a decline than the CAD?

It looks like the UK will up its interest rates through the Bank of England again and that's causing more problems, but Canada has this issue too and there's lot of recent news on consumer confidence falling and inflation in Canada.

personalfinance,When to refinance private student loans?,"So my husband finished up getting another degree this summer. While he was in school his private student loans from his first degree were on hold. It’s a lot of debt about $70,000 spread over like 7 loans with the highest interest being 11%. This amounts to about $700 a month in repayment. We want to refinance for a few reasons: get them under one interest rate, see if we can lower the payment. He got a job after graduating that he’s been working and makes about $60,000 a year. I’m not currently working because I’m taking care of our kids. It’s probably going to be a few years before I can do anymore than a part time job because of my line of work and the cost of childcare in our area.

Fidelity can't find me in their system as a valid participant.  What's strange is that they did know I left Playtex in 1988.  That makes me think that they have some kind of history on me.

personalfinance,Florida Prepaid - lump sum or pay over time?,"I’m pretty set on doing Florida Prepaid to pay for college for my infant son. The program is very low risk and basically allows you to pay up front for the cost of four years of tuition at a Florida public university. 

My question is - would it be better to pay the lump sum or pay over time? 

The cost of the lump sum is about $28,500. 

Paying over time would be $185/mo for 211 months (about 18 years). The total payment would be about $39,000. This is roughly equivalent to borrowing the cost of the lump sum ($28,500) and paying it back over 18 years at about a 4 percent interest rate.

I recently left a high paying, stressful corporate job for a lower paying job that is much lower stress, so I have quite a bit in the bank but stretch my take home pay pretty thin every month (after maxing out retirement accounts). To come up with the lump sum I would need to sell off some I bonds (have about 50k) and or some stocks in a vanguard brokerage account (have about 300k). 

My thought is I could probably do better than 4 percent nominal returns keeping the money invested, so I should pay over time, but not having to make the monthly payment for the next 18 years on a pretty thin budget sounds nice too. (Although if I ever spend more than my take home I can sell off some stock to cover the difference.)

Any thoughts on lump sum versus paying over time?",finance,1648656585.0

I was accepted into a 3 year full time graduate school program at a public school (\~18k year tuition) for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists. I start soon but just thought what the hey, let me ask the reddit gods what they think of my planning. I love food for thought as well as being able to see from other points of view.

&amp;#x200B;

Savings: 70k cash 

Rent: 2k month with groceries and all bills

Misc spending: \~500-1k month depending on whats up

&amp;#x200B;

My partner graduated with their degree recently and we still have \~60k left to pay on it. it was a personal loan from a big bank. interest rate \~8%

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I need help. My plan was to simply live off of my 70k cash - pull out exactly the amount my partner was going to pull out (hoping that the same bank would also lend me the same amount with similar terms). My partner is working full time and makes decent money. 

BUT what do you all think? Should I pay off my spouses loan with my cash, then have my spouse pay for my living expenses as opposed to paying the bank? I love this idea but was wondering if it was stupid. Also side note - I have been intentionally holding back not paying so that way when it does come time to apply for a private loan I can show I have some equity - but it may just be a wash as it may be looked as the same as no debt but no equity or debt with equity. 

&amp;#x200B;

2nd is there any other advice other grad students or anyone has? I am about to apply for FAFSA today and was even wondering if I qualify for it or if its worth my time to do.

vet,Is this kennel cough or something else?,"Rescued a husky from previous owner on Craigslist. He did not charge anything for him. He is 3 years old. 

I have had him for 4 days now, did not show any symptoms day one other than sneezing. Now he is showing many symptoms of something. I think it’s kennel cough.

Symptoms:
• Heavy mucus runny nose with sniffling when sleeping 
• LOTS of normal sneezing
• Reverse sneezing (identified from videos online)
• Loud hacking/coughing noises 
• Active vomiting of thick clear and white mucus, he has vomited small to large amounts over 15 times within a 8 hours. 
• Heavy breathing 

Notes: 
• I do not believe previous owner had him on heartworm preventatives
• I did NOT change any of his food and was confirmed by owner to be the same food
• When symptoms started we had not been around any other dogs from when I got him, but we did go into an empty dog park and he had sniffed poo
• He could have been around other dogs before I got him, I am not sure 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am led to believe it is most likely kennel cough, but I am unsure.

stocks,RKT - Bull thesis,"We’re nearing the end of a pretty nasty downtrend trend for Rocket Companies (RKT), but it may be time to consider buying in at these levels for a long position. I’d love feedback on my thesis below.

It’s no secret that the stock has struggled in the face of raising interest rates to combat inflation. It’s been looming over the stock since early 2021 (aside from when it meme’d). Now that we have a little more clarity from the FED on what we’re dealing with and how we’re gonna handle it, the next few years may actually be favorable for Rocket even if on the surface, they’ll be making less money than they did during the pandemic. 

I believe the competition will be way more affected by higher interest rates than RKT. This is a reality that all mortgage companies have to deal with. But RKT has deep pockets along with more diversification into other revenue streams to wait out slower periods. I believe there will be more consolidation in the mortgage industry in the next few years (we’re already seeking it with moves like Better.com, look that up if you haven’t seen that mess) and it’ll only help RKT obtain more market share. 

The execs at RKT have also been very savvy with acquisitions to grow their platform outside the traditional mortgage route. I predicted that they’d start acquiring companies about 3 months ago (see post history) and they bought Truebill (a 1.275 billion all cash deal) a few weeks after my post. They’re funneling tons of cash into advertising this app. I see adds EVERYWHERE for it (youtube ads, public transit, etc) and it’s a brilliant way to get users in the door/into the ecosystem for more service offerings. The user base growth is a story no one seems to be talking about. It will be key in the long run as they strive to obtain the most market share. I expect another major acquisition to be done by the end of 2022 at the latest. Jay Farner (CEO) stated that they’d be very aggressive this year to acquire companies as they become more appealing to buy with everything coming down from pandemic highs. 

And the cherry on top, Jay also stated that he plans to buy $36 million of his own stock throughout the year of 2022. The stock price of 10-11 seems to be an established floor with the worst news already known and behind us. The upside heavily outweighs any risks that I see but I’d love to hear any *constructive* negative theories that you may have (especially at these prices).

Position, 3600ish shares (dividend $ recently reinvested back into the stock, rounding) @ a 17 average. I’ll be buying calls soon as well. Preparing to buy call leaps by the end of the week. I expect this to be a 20 stock by 2023.",finance,1648666580.0

I'm just out of grad school living in a high-cost area. I work full time and earn a decent wage, but somehow I can't seem to get out of debt. Grad school was immensely expensive, time consuming, and  emotionally draining - but I'm happy to have that behind me. In the next few years, I'd like to save for a down payment on a house and generally become financially independent. I plan to max out my savings in a 401k (eligible for it in July, 8% employer match) and continue to contribute to my Vanguard account via index funds. 

I currently have a pretty steep amount of CC debt and would like to pay it off as soon as I can - ideally before student loans kick in, which should be sometime around Jan. 2023, pending any further legislation. I use Truebill for budgeting, but I am awful about sticking to it, especially because my credit limit is high. How do I become more financially responsible, sound, and etc? I am embarrassed because I feel that my partner (and generally everyone around me) is more responsible and financially literate than I am, and most people I know earn twice as much as I do and own their homes. Given the current housing market, I feel like my partner and I will never get ahead, even though we make $190k combined. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, all this to say...can y'all help me figure out what I need to do to get myself in better footing? I have considered taking out a personal loan or balance transfer CC to get myself out of the hole I dug myself, but I also don't want to have a hard inquiry on my credit report.

Our current home’s estimated value is $350K. It carries a $175K mortgage balance at a 3.25% rate. With property taxes the monthly payment is $1,570. We purchased this home in 2015 for $220K. Since moving in we have dealt with many costly issues: leaking roof, flooding basement, etc.   

I currently work from home and my wife works close to where we plan to move (about an hour away). The plan is to sell our current home, use proceeds from the sale to pay as much of our student loans as possible while leaving small amount for a down payment on our next home. Ideally the house would be smaller and less costly to maintain than our current one.  We do not plan on having children. The new home would cost somewhere between $275K and $325K. I am a veteran and plan to use a VA loan with the expectation it would have a relatively lower interest rate.  

I have some reservations about this strategy I was hoping you could address:

· Low housing inventory to choose from.

· The possibility of becoming “underwater” in the new home.

· With mortgage rates expected to increase, this narrows the difference between our student loans and the mortgage rate of the new home. 

Would 2022 be a good time to put this strategy into action? Would it better to sell now and rent for a couple of years while the housing market cools off?",finance,1648672270.0

First portion will go entirely towards my credit card debt but I’m having trouble deciding which one to do first: 

1) Apple: ~$900 balance, 21.99% APR 
2) Discover: ~$1600 balance, 15.99% APR

The second would probably be what to allocate the leftover monthly $1000 into that will become a nice emergency fund. High-yield savings or investing, I can’t decide.

investing,Bond funds during period of rising interest rates,"I'm sure I'm overlooking something big here, and I'm hoping someone can help clear this up for me. But to me, being in a bond fund right now is worse than holding cash. 

It seems very likely that interest rates will be rising over the next year or two--not guaranteed but highly likely. As I understand it, the value of bond funds (the NAV) will decrease as rates increase, and that has certainly been happening since last year. For example, VBTLX is down about 6% just this year. 

Eventually the higher interest rates will make bond funds more attractive, but for now you're losing more principal than you are getting in dividends (which is only 2% or so for VBTLX). And the losses should continue as rates rise. 

At some point the higher interest rate will offset the loss in NAV, but we seem to be a ways from that happening. 

So why bond funds and not cash during this period of rising rates?

But here's where it falls apart.  He wanted me to front the shipping via a cash app.  Specifically he wanted Zelle.   I use Zelle all the time, not a big deal.  But I use it for things I see (and oddly enough my rent, weird).  I asked the guy to accept shipping payment via FB marketplace or PayPal.   He responds that he doesnt really know how to make the listing work on FB marketplace, and he didn't want to make a new paypal just for this.   And here then comes the emotional appeal.  He trusts me and would never do anything to hurt a good guy like me.....

So all in all, if it's too good to be true, it very likely is.

The FT article (reported on here in [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2022/03/30/deepmind-sexual-harassment-allegations-mishandled-ft/amp/)) goes on to suggest that the mishandling may have been deliberate in order to exploit legal loopholes in the UK where victims have a limited amount of time to take a case to employment tribunal. 

This comes shortly after Mustafa Suleyman, one of the cofounders was quietly shuffled out to Google (he has subsequently left and founded a new [startup](https://inflection.ai/about.html) with another DeepMind alum) after he was found to have [bullied and humiliated staff](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/deepmind-co-founder-investigated-by-law-firm-after-staff-complaints-.html) for years.

Google itself also has a poor record when it comes to sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation at the highest levels resulting in payouts of hundreds of millions of dollars. 

Given that DeepMind and Google have a pretty strong grip on the development of AI in terms of employing many of the key people across many of the various subfields, having access to unparalleled data and compute and pushing forward more and more into health (for example the DeepMind offshoot [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com) which itself is headed by Demis and staffed by DeepMinders, and the various Google healthcare bets and projects), can we really trust them to be stewards of fair and responsible AI development? 

Bad things happen in all large organizations. But DeepMind isn’t that big and in the past five years, DeepMind leadership have presided over a steady stream of sexual harassment, bullying and other scandals and handled them all extremely poorly and showed little signs that things have changed. This points to something rotten in the culture and leadership there and at it’s parent organization.",technology,1648705473.0
stocks,"Micron's second-quarter revenue beat estimates, but shares fell -4%. Does this mean MU and tech stocks are about to fall?","On Wednesday, Micron reported better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue rising more than 60%.

MU stock rose sharply to about 4.5% at the opening, but the good times did not last long, and then fell all the way, the lowest fell to about -4%, and closed at -3.52%.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq fell -1.21% on Wednesday. Earlier, the Fed's Bostic reiterated his support for six rate hikes in 2022.

Does this mean that MU or including tech stocks will see a big drop?

28. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14). There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union."" Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

29. Here’s some analysis of the EU MiCA draft language guessing that there’s a good chance it will pass today (March 14) but that it might be removed during “Trilogues” which will be the subsequent informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission.

computers,[Question] Latest software on old hardware?,"I want to ask what would it be like if someone wanted to use the latest and hardest software, but have a different taste for hardware?

Like a old ebay $35 i5-4570 motherboard paired with a old ebay $50 R7 360 and a $30 USB SSD. Using Fedora for purposes of running leading versions of software and with new technologies like RADV, OpenCL

Or some old ebay Nexus 6P sold for $30 (and $16 for a more powerful aftermarket battery) which is paired with the latest Ubuntu touch, postmarketos, or as recent android builds using Gapps or MicroG. To ensure it would not lag behind, software-wise...

Or even the old Pine64 A64 single board computers which seem to run a very reliable and stable and studied SoC. It being ancient, can attempt to keep a up-to-date version of Linux for attempts at running modern software.

Something like what would happen when new software is run on older hardware.",technology,1648708493.0

personalfinance,"Want to go back to university and change careers, please tell me based off details what decisions I should make?","So, I have a BA in criminal justice from a state university. Although I somewhat like my job (correctional officer on 3rd shift) I want to someday make a total career change. I have always been good at math/science and want to get a BSN in nursing. After reaching out to my local state university (same one I graduated from in 2016) for me to re-enter and get into the nursing program I would need approx. 1.5 years/3 semesters of more science/math undergrad studies, then would need to get into the college of nursing (acceptance rate of 70%) &gt; Then after accepted I would need to do another 2 years of college before graduating. 

My current finances: State pension = $20k, 457 Def. Comp. plan = $11k, Brokerage accounts (3 of them) = $28k, Emergency fund in savings account = $12k. Only debt is $10k in student loan debt. So my net worth is $61k. 

I am going to get right down to what I want out of this post = I want to legally not pay for as much college as possible. When I went to university the first time my mom/dad were divorced and my mom had no money/was not working. I got 80% of college paid for. My friend told me to put everything into my pension or into my 457 plan because those are *not* counted towards your FAFSA - whereas savings/brokerage stuff is counted. 

Furthermore, on a more personal note I have lived with a grandparent the last 6 years since graduating from college. They probably have another 8 years of life on this earth. Would you recommend living on campus for the 3 years or just stay home? The university if 20 minutes away - mind you I live in the midwest where we get snow often for half of the year. My stepmom told me I am being ridiculous to not go back to living on campus because in her words ""you were successful in getting your original BA because you lived on campus and had no need for a car/pay for gas/snow days."" 

I just do not know tbh. I am 28 and want a career change. To everyone in law enforcement/corrections and have done it for decades or are planning on doing it for the long term - I wish you all luck but I do not know how you do it. I have worked an average of 72 hours the past 2 years thanks to COVID getting in the prison and also with staff being out and also thanks to the great resignation. I want to become a nurse and actually help people. Please guide me reddit people on how to navigate all of my personal finances to make this possible. 

Current monthly budget: Rent ($200), food ($400), haircut = $30, gas = $200, cell phone/subscriptions - $75, gym membership = $10, student loan payment (would be paused while in college = $130). 

Made $72k last year in gross income. Would probably not work at all during the 3 years in college, meaning I would be a dislocated worker. Did do a mock FAFSA and would only be expected to contribute $3k a year assuming I stuffed all money in my pension or my 457.",finance,1648728516.0

stocks,(3/31) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of March and Q1! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, March the 31st, 2022-

*****

# [Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed as Wall Street gets set to end a wild quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed in early morning trading Thursday as traders wrap up a month and quarter.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 26 points, or less than 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Some tech stocks were under pressure Thursday amid analysts concerns over the PC market going forward. AMD shares slipped more than 1% in the premarket after analysts at Barclays downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight. Meanwhile, HP Inc and Dell dipped 3.8% and 2%, respectively, after being downgraded to equal weight from overweight at Morgan Stanley.
*****
&gt; Oil prices fell sharply, with West Texas Intermediate futures dropping 5% to $102.18 per barrel. That comes as President Joe Biden’s administration considers a plan to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the strategic petroleum reserve for about six months, a source told NBC News.
*****
&gt; Volatile oil prices have loomed over equities, with U.S. crude prices climbing more than 3% on Wednesday. Germany warned of potential rationing of natural gas due to disputes with Russia, and U.S. crude stockpiles fell.
*****
&gt; “We’re going to be bouncing around between good news and bad news, unfortunately,” said George Mateyo, Key Private Bank chief investment officer. “That’s going to create some volatility.”
*****
&gt; Thursday marks the last trading day of March and of the first quarter.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are on pace to finish the month up about 5% each, while the Dow is nearly 4% higher in March. For the first quarter, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down about 3% and the Nasdaq is off more than 7%.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as traders grapple with the Federal Reserve’s plans to tighten monetary policy this year to fight a spike in U.S. inflation, while the Ukraine-Russia war rages on.
*****
&gt; Investors are awaiting weekly jobless claims and personal income and spending data to be released Thursday morning.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a down session Wednesday in which the Dow and S&amp;P 500 each snapped four-day win streaks. The Dow shed 65.38 points, or 0.2%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq lost 1.2%.

personalfinance,How to deal with rates/home value exposure during build,"Hey, 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are building a home that will cost at closing $359,300. The building process takes some time so we won't be able to close until January. We are watching the rates skyrocket and additionally keep seeing articles saying we're potentially in a housing bubble. Her/I are panicked that there is a chance we signed a contract to buy a house at the absolute peak, will end up selling a house in a crashed market, and have a sky high mortgage rate to boot. It's causing us major heartburn and stress - Our down payment is tied up in our current home. Market rate for it is $245-250 and our current remaining mortgage is $70k (will be around 60k at close as we're putting every extra dollar in it) If the housing market collapses it will majorly effect our down payment &amp; our new monthly mortgage payment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Through a company that partners with the home builder they have offered to buy our house for $225 and will pay for us to have movers (we pay closing costs) and we get to sign that contract today and lock them in - and once we are ready to close on new house then they will buy our house for the $225. 

Should my wife/I take their deal and know that no matter what happens to market our house value is locked in - or risk it for the biscuit and try to sell the house this winter? For the mortgage interest rate side we plan to do a 180 day lock which adds .500% to market rate with a closing day float down option to .125% market rate  - that should somewhat help our exposure there. 

&amp;#x200B;

vet,"mother dog is worried about one of her pups, but everything seems fine","**Update**: I called my vet. they feel the deworming might be why he is not feeling alright. Weighing him shows he has grown since this morning though. Tomorrow morning i'll weigh again and if he has not gained at least 10% weight we will go for a visit.

**Also, to the person who felt it necessary to downvote**, thanks for making my post less visible when i am asking for help. I wish you eternal butt itchiness with arms that are too short to reach.

&amp;#x200B;

My dog had pups 2,5 weeks ago.

The start was rough, as she had a c-section and the pups kept worrying her wound.

The pups do drink with the mom, but due to the stress and her wound being open in the beginning  her milk production is low.

The pups are therefore partially bottle-fed, but I make sure they drink from mom too.

My dog takes care of the pups, but she is not exactly mom of the year. If they squeal she doesn't immediately check on them, unless they're really persistent. I often have to tell her to stay with the pups, which she then does, but begrudgingly.

If something is wrong with the pups and she doesn't know what to do, she does come and get me and I go and see. mostly it's things like they got stuck in a towel.

Today my dog keeps coming to get me and is constantly licking one of the pups. The pup seems fine, although I feel he is not as lively as usual. (this pup is a food fanatic, whenever he smells he starts squeaking and searching for the bottle) When I come and check him, he is responsive, but not like his usual self. I still gave him a bottle and he drank redaily once the nipple was in his mouth.

My dog still worries and she in constantly walking between me and this pup, making her ""I'm worried "" sound. her usually not being too worried about them makes me wonder if something is actually wrong.

She is not worried about the other pup, who behaves like her normal self.

A little more info:

born by c-section on march 12. 2 pups.

birthweight 192 gram, weight now 893 grams

breed: mixed mom kokoni/maltese and dad pomerian/jack russell. This specific pup seems like he might have a lot of maltese characteristics

they stay in a whelping box with an infrared lamp. the temperature is about 26 degrees celsius.

they were dewormed 2 days ago.

personalfinance,Rookie Question: Why not always refinance a loan when you are offered a lower interest rate?,"I spoke with my dad about it, and he said it's because you have to factor in an initial fee for the refinance, as well. So, for instance, if you have to pay $3000 off the bat to refinance with a lower rate, you would have to calculate whether the cost savings for the lower interest rate (in total, over the course of the term) would be greater than the initial fee. In addition, i imagine this would only be desirable if you intend to complete the term of your loan (and not sell your interest beforehand).

investing,Reluctant to invest in real estate because it may be immoral.,"Hear me out. It’s not any one person’s fault. But housing has become relatively unaffordable for the working class. Real estate has become a store of value in a way it shouldn’t partially due to the incentives in place resulting from our monetary policy. In the 80s, you could make double digit returns in a savings account. Now, savings accounts are negative real yield and significantly so. Again, this is not the fault of real estate investors. They’re just playing the game with the rules presented. 

I’m a small business owner with ~30 employees, and I see their struggles. My workers are not minimum wage, either. As I’ve been investing my money I’m frequently tempted to buy a rental as part of a diversified strategy, and I’ve done it before. 

But if I become a landlord, I “have” to directly participate in the inflationary market that makes housing less and less affordable for the working class. I don’t like that. 

Equities are less directly a problem because it’s less of a zero sum. Everyone can participate. But everyone “needs” housing. 

So, my chosen investments have been equities and Bitcoin. I’m not here to “orange pill” anyone. I just see these as open systems that don’t necessarily promote wealth inequality like real estate seems to.

Can someone show me how I’m wrong from a moral standpoint assuming I care about the wealth of the working class? I’m still tempted to add rentals to my strategy. It just feels wrongish atm. 

Open to contrary perspectives.


EDIT: Ok. So, for the first time, I understand what ""RIP my Inbox"" means. One small clarification. I am using the context of investment. So, the idea of charging less than cost is more like charity to me. That's fine! But, that's not what I'm talking about. I'll show you the napkin math. Median per capita income in my area is about 38k. Small (sub 1000 sqft) SFHs or condo in the same area start at $350k. With a 20% down payment, Cost comes in right about 1600 per month. This is right about 50% of GROSS income for a person here without any profit built in. Just pretty ugly. Now, a person can get help, they can buy with a partner or a family member, etc. I understand. But, the starting place is pretty ugly. So, it feels wrong to participate in that. If you're a median family of two it works okish until you add a child.",finance,1648738657.0

ethereum,the Merge is coming! a few things to expect,"Sharing [this thread](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1508478499325202435?s=20&amp;t=RQzPSM9y-R56aF0lAhcILQ) of Merge info so the community can get acquainted with what to expect in a few months.

1. Unburnt fees (aka tips) on the execution layer (EL) begin going each block's proposer - completely liquid on the EL. Over a typical week, this is \~14k ETH / $42mm
2. Due to the amount of work required to properly test and verify the Merge across all clients, Beacon Chain validator withdrawals of staked ETH are only expected to be included in the upgrade after (Shanghai). Work from [@ralexstokes](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes) has started [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895)
3. Post-merge, blocks will arrive exactly every 12s. Today, they arrive in a poisson distribution around \~13s. For devs: do not assume \~13s blocktimes (eg. to calculate an interest rate) - please make sure to use timestamps.  More [here](http://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/) from [@TimBeiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko)
4. **The Merge/ Proof of Stake will not reduce fees on mainnet**. Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace, but not significantly. Av. blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand. Near-term scaling &amp; lower fees will be on Layer 2s!
5. To any stakers: you should start running a local execution layer (EL) client ahead of the Merge. In the future, outsourcing this to third-party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under the [Proof of Custody game](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/09/30/proofs-of-custody.html)
6. The Merge will use accumulated difficulty (Total Terminal Difficulty) to trigger the PoW→PoS upgrade, instead of block height ""An attacker cld use a minority of hash power to build a malicious chain fork that wld satisfy the block height req"". more [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675#terminal-total-difficulty-vs-block-number)
7. At the Merge, the 2 ETH PoW block reward goes away. new issuance will only come from PoS validators proposing blocks (\~.025 ETH) or ""attesting"" aka voting on network state (\~.00002 ETH)  4.3% PoW issuance → .43% in PoS h/t [@litocoen](https://twitter.com/litocoen). Higher security w/ lower spend!
8. Running a node post-Merge does not require any ETH (and never has). This is an important part of Ethereum culture that should be accessible to all. (Staking independently - aka consensus activities - does require 32 ETH. With some providers, it may be lower than 32.",cryptocurrency,1648740677.0

personalfinance,Renting vs buying - would renting another 2 years to wait out the interest rates be smart? or delaying inevitable?,"Hello, I am wondering if anybody could offer some perspective here. I have been trying to figure this out and would love some advice.

We are currently renting a 4 bedroom/2.5 bath house (with ample storage, and a front yard) for a little under $2k per month. We have a lot of room in our budget to save for our down payment and other things.

We have the opportunity to buy a home near us (more square footage, same bedrooms/baths) but with less of a yard for 650K. We would put 12% down and including all other payment inputs, would be paying roughly $3800 per month on mortgage. We have a ""good"" rate locked in at 4.375%. Good elementary school for our 2.5 year old's future.

Household income is around $173K &amp; no other debts (though we probably need a new car).

House price was more than I had planned, but I think that is just what the going rate is around here after the past 2 years. Don't want to wait too long because the rates and house prices will rise, but I also know my rent won't be raised dramatically in next few years.

Also, just a small note of preference - no yard is a bummer but the cul-de-sac on the house is really nice, and we could do some work to have a small front yard green space.

Lending Club Debt Consolidation- $3.600 remaining with 9 months left - $400 a month

Tally Debt Consolidation - $8100 remaining with 31 months - $265 a month

Credit Cards: Total amount: $19,400 across 5 credit cards - about $550 a month for minimum payments

Rent: $675 a month

Car insurance: $153.27 a month

Utilities (Wifi/Electricity/Gas) - $200 a month

Subscriptions: About $30 a month

So at this point, I'm at a little over $2500 a month in just bills before necessities like food, which is about $75-$100 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work in HR at a hotel and I love what I do. I majored in Hospitality Management, worked in hotels across 3 different departments for the last 7 years and I am currently making $20 an hour. Seems decent until you factor in taxes and benefits taken out. I usually see a paycheck for $1250 about twice a month. I have been talking to my boss about a raise which I should see in about a month, expecting it to go up to $22 an hour, hopefully a little more.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking into picking up a part-time job, something in the evenings, and clerical-based like my main position. I also use TrueBill to track my finances, it summarizes my monthly spending and income so it's been helping me track some unnecessary spending. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always try to pay more than the minimum on my credit cards, usually $20-$50 extra per card, but i feel it's getting me stuck. While I'm paying off more of my credit limit, I have no money left over for other expenses, like food, from my bank account so I'm using my credit cards to pay fro things. It just feels like an endless circle of getting myself a little comfortable and then being back in a negative net balance.

&amp;#x200B;

The student loan is another thing that, thankfully, keeps getting pushed off due to the pandemic. I have a $30,000 total balance and it takes about $340 a month. This coming May, student loans are expected to start up again so we'll see if gets pushed off again. It's a federal loan if that information helps. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I've been thinking of just paying the minimum on my credit cards for a while but paying more on my loans so the principal amount goes down faster, thus paying them off incrementally fast. Especially for the Lending Tree debt loan, since it's close to being finished.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really trying to be better about my finance, I know my past decisions have gotten me here and I want to fix it. I'm just looking for help and to be pointed in the right direction. Should I see a financial advisor? Life guru? bankruptcy at worst? I'd love to hear what you all have to say! Thank you for reading and your assistance in advance!

Edit: thank you everyone for your input and advice! I talked to my boss about my situation yesterday and she completely understands. We’re going to have another meeting next week to talk about goals and accomplishments and base it off that. I can also work from home with my job so I might sign on and work on some thing’s at home to get overtime, which for our company is time and a half, which currently is $30 an hour.

I will definitely use the avalanche method from now on when dealing with my debts, I will also call all my creditors to let them know what’s going on and try to sweet talk or convince them to get me a lower apr rate.

I am keeping my car, I drive 40 miles each day to and from work and do a trip up to a city about an hour away once every few weeks.

personalfinance,House Paid Off vs. Investing - Tale as Old as Time,"Hey all, I'm in my 30s and make about $150,000 to $200,000 a year.  I am self-employed so income varies.  I have a 30 year mortgage at a 3.725% interest rate and am 4 years into it.  Original loan was for $269,000 and I have been chipping down at it hard and have it down to a balance of $188,000.  My house has gone up in value about $85,000 since I bought it.

I find myself getting impatient and just throwing all of my money at my mortgage each month.   Also, my car is paid off as I bought it with cash years ago.  No other major debt, student loans, etc. minus a business loan of $30,000.

I do not have an IRA (bad I know), but do have about $65,000 in investing in managed accounts, some crypto, DCA into VTI, SPY, and QQQ and a 6 month emergency fund of about $40,000 in savings.

I have been paying quite a bit extra on the mortgage and the peace of mind feels great to me to have it all paid off in the event my business goes down to nothing, but the rational part of my brain says invest; however, the market now seems to uncertain with recession fears, etc.

Right now, I live like I am broke and do not spend extra money on materialistic thing, etc.  The only ""luxurious"" thing I do is have my groceries delivered.  Have been on one vacation in 6 years.  It sucks to be making good money and feel like I'm broke, but I know it will pay off.

I feel as if I'm in a good position for being 30 years old, but my goal is to eventually retire by 40 and I feel as if a paid off house is a good way to get there in terms of peace of mind.

My question is:  Should I continue to chip away at the mortgage while DCA into my few ETFs or just go all out this year and max payments to my mortgage?

stocks,Some high quality hidden gems based on fundamentals and value,"A lot of FUD going around recently even though the market is still off its highs. I have been meanwhile finding some great gems that show great value, no matter what the market does. Thought I would share. My approach is all based on fundamental financial analysis, no TA BS. I am summarizing and writing this off the top of my head so some numbers may not be exact, but the thesis is fucking fantastic.

**GNL -** 10%+ dividend and at least 20-30% upside.

So Global Net leases is a REIT that was trading around $25-$30 pre-pandemic. Pandemic hits and everyone shit their pants because GNL has about 30% expsoure to office buildings, fair. But 2 years later, they have retained 100% of their leases, doubled their net lease duration, and maintained or increased their dividend. Right now trading at around $16/sh with a yield over $10. Like holy fuck how can you NOT invest in this? also, their office exposure is not like the random strip mall office, its HQ of corporations like FedEx, McLaren, Finnair (ok, maybe Putin will fuck the last one up, but their largest client is only 2% of revenue). I mean literally the company would have to lose something like 40% of its revenue base and WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A 7-8% DIVIDEND YIELD.

EDIT: *Note on Debt:* A few people pointed out the high / rising debt. Keep in mind most of this is in mortgages not unsecured or corporate loans (thought they have added some of this recently taking advantage of low interest). So, they buy a property and finance a chunk of it using mortgages, and as they grow of course the debt level will grow. But the debt service coverage ratio is only 3.8x, pretty dang conservative. 

**PSTG** \- 23% Revenue CAGR, solving the world data storage crisis.

Ok, so this one was a Cathy Wood pick and maybe that alone is a reason to avoid it, but she does have some good picks. PSTG provides high efficiency data memory and storage solutions, basically solving the problem of how the hell do you build highly secure, efficient, eco friendly data centers. They offer both cloud storage and hardware for on site.

Anyway, although their stock has been volatile, the company has been quietly crushing it on all financial metrics: revenue, profitability, SaaS growth, economies of scale, etc etc. And compared to other tech stocks at eye watering multiples, these guys are at 4.5x EV / Revenue and about 20x 2023 EBITDA. With cloud, AI, VR, iot (put in all the other buzzwords) tailwinds their growth rate is more than secure and few competitors at scale are able to provide the solution that they can.

**My own Semiconductor Picks and Axes Index: ONTO, LRCX, KLAC, COHU, UCTT**

So the semiconductor gold rush is on. Everyone sees the writing on the wall that he who can make the most semis will win. But then you look at the valuations of NVDA and the shit performance of INTC and you say ""what the fuck"". Others like Hitachi and Samsung etc are just as shit and burdened with other lines of businesses. The truth is the semi market is competitive, subject to commodity prices, and subject to component prices, etc.

Its like the CA gold rush: yes everyone wants the gold but not every prospector is going to win. But the guy selling the picks and axes and shovels to every Joe Shmo who got tired of his shitty life on the East Coast and said ""im moving to CA"" is going to make money no matter what. That is what these bunch of stocks do.

They provide testing, monitoring, assembly, and other shit that goes into a semi conductor factory. There are about 12 MAJOR factories going up over the next 2-3 years. The semi market will grow at nice 8-10% CAGR. BUT the CAPEX on Semi facilities is forecasted to grow 14% (so ya net net semi conductor produces are losing 4%). These bunch have the best growth, profitability, and valuations to capture that 14% growth.",finance,1648748802.0

personalfinance,Saving for baby vs paying down debt,"My spouse and I are expecting a baby this year. We’ve been squirreling away any extra money in a “baby slush fund” for big one-time expenses like setting up the nursery and buying necessities. This is in addition to a 3-month emergency fund that we do not touch, and a well-funded HSA (so medical expenses are covered). Monthly expenses like childcare and insurance premiums have been accounted for in our post-baby budget.

It took awhile to get pregnant, and so we ended up saving more in the slush fund than we strictly need. Assuming my baby budgeting calculations are ballpark reasonable, we'll have twice as much as we need when baby comes. (I know that’s a good problem to have; I hope this doesn’t come off as tone deaf.) We’ll use any extra cash to pay down my student loans. But I don’t know when to start throwing money at them again. 

Part of me wants to wait completely until baby comes, and my spouse and I are both back at work--just in case. But my fear is that with “over-saving” / stockpiling cash, it's too easy to justify over-spending. We're feeling the new parent pressure to buy ALL THE THINGS. I’m trying to resist but technically we have the cash to do so; it’s just at the expense of our long term goals. 

Any advice for when we should start refocusing on loans--before or after baby comes? I just feel like we have enough already saved (although I don't want to get overly confident as a not-yet-parent), and it might be time to reallocate some of those funds. We’ve ignored my student loans for two years, which has allowed us to buy a house and prepare for baby. But we can’t ignore them forever. The interest rate (once the pause is over) is around 5.5%. I think we can pay them off by the end of next year, IF we don’t go totally crazy with our baby spending.",finance,1648750115.0

solar,Should I get a loan to go solar?,"I want to be as sustainable as possible so going solar is pretty important to me. We will get an EV as soon as one is available to us as well. 

Saving up for a solar project would take 5+ years including redoing the roof, a battery, 200 amp upgrade and labor. We are talking maybe 55k total ($2.65 per Watt). That will make doing the roof imminent as we just had damage and don't expect it to last much longer. We can get a loan that is 2.6% apr plus 6% financing cost and a single re-ammortization opportunity within 18 months (in essence to apply the tax credit). The tax credit should give something close to 10k assuming I don't try to squeeze the roof cost in which may wife would not go for. That would be 1500 less next year with the reduced credit, plus interest rates will almost definitely keep going up. Payments would be around $450. We could and would probably make double payments so we may save some interest costs. We could also put up to 10k down to reduce total cost of financing but I'd rather not right now as our portfolio isnt doing all that good. Our most expensive electric bill is around $200/month for quite a few months in SoCal.

Republicans have criticized him for scolding the U.S. oil industry and pushing for alternative-energy sources even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underscored the world’s dependence on fossil fuels.

Mr. Biden has shifted course recently, including announcing that the U.S. would ship more liquefied natural gas to Europe to help countries there reduce their dependence on Russian gas.

That shift, however, drove concerns among progressives who think the Democratic president is stepping back from his campaign promise to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels. Democrats also have chafed at White House attempts to get authoritarian regimes such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to produce more oil.

A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Biden “wants to do everything possible and sensible to mitigate” the effect of high energy prices on American families.

“He’s been clear in recent remarks that oil and gas companies should help ensure that oil supply meets demand, and at the same time we need to advance clean energy options and decrease our reliance on fossil fuels,” the spokeswoman said.

Decade-high prices and limited spare capacity give Mr. Biden few places to turn aside from oil companies he has shunned as climate polluters and foreign producers with checkered histories, said Samantha Gross, a fellow specializing in climate and energy at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.",finance,1648754958.0

* Interest rate is at 23.29%
* Interest is variable.
* Balance opened at £8000 on Feburary 2020.
* I've been paying the minimum balance only since, due to financial constraints.

* Paid on 15/03/2022
* Interest was £104.08
* My next requested minimum payment is £161.20, on 14/04/2022
* My estimated interest for that payment is £113.70

The statement also explains that interest is charged on the total value of the statement, not just the outstanding balance (side question, what?) 

By paying a grand total of £675.34 a month (including the minimum and an additional payment on the 30th of each month) I estimate I will pay this balance off by February 2023, with the final additional payment being £703.51

defi,"We built a smart contract wallet to make crypto easier for anyone to adopt. DeFi has many great innovations that empower individuals, yet the friction is still too high.","Check it out here: [stackup.sh](https://stackup.sh/) or [app.stackup.sh](https://app.stackup.sh/)

About 10 months ago I made this post about [building my own crypto native savings account](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/ok0vjc/i_built_my_own_crypto_native_savings_account_the/) and thought it was amazing how anyone in the world could get access to a much more efficient financial system without asking for permission. Since then, one thing I learnt is that although these DeFi innovations can empower us with things like better interest rates, lower trading fees, and faster cross border payments to name a few, there's still way too much friction for the average user to access it without spending 100 hours going down the crypto rabbit hole.

IMO, the friction from crypto comes from many small issues that add up to a bad user experience where onboarding takes forever and most people just can't be fucked. To try and solve this we made a first attempt at building a wallet that cuts out a lot of these pain points so that the average user can get into crypto in 5 minutes rather than 100 hours. Heres how:

* Abstracting seed phrases away and using a non-custodial username and password flow instead. Private keys and seed phrases might be too hard to begin with. But a username and password is something most users can understand.
* Implementing [social recovery](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html) because the risk of loosing everything from a lost secret is not acceptable for a future financial system.
* Transaction fees paid in USDC. Most people are already use to paying for everything in a single currency and let backend systems handle the conversions where necessary. Whereas in crypto if I want to do anything I still need to make sure I have enough ETH/MATIC/whatever to pay for gas. This actually adds a lot of other steps to the process that I don't really care about if my goal is to just deposit some USDC into Aave for example.
* Bundling a lot of low level transaction into just one transaction. The simplest example here would be something like approve and swap. I trust a protocol like Uniswap to not do anything malicious so rather than sending two transactions to approve and then to swap, we can save the effort and bundle them into one transaction. Bundling can also enable more advanced use cases too like MEV protection by preventing sandwich attacks.
* Being interoperable. Right now we're only available on Polygon. But we built this in a way so that it can be used on any EVM compatible network while still keeping your original address.

As mentioned in the first post, the ultimate goal is to build things to help people get into DeFi more easily. This is only the first release so there's a lot of improvements to be made. But if you find this interesting, definitely come chat to us on [discord](https://discord.gg/FpXmvKrNed) or if you want the latest updates you can follow us at [stackup.substack.com](https://stackup.substack.com/) and [@stackup\_fi](https://twitter.com/stackup_fi).

vet,"""Sudden"" behavioral changes in ASTCD","So my boy just turned 8 back in January, terrible cattle Dog, well, terrible sheep dog, because he's a cattle Dog.

Been a wonderful family pet.

However recently he's got a rash around his eyes and ears, started losing some hair, but the vet has no idea what it is.

Antihistamines didn't touch it, we've checked their pen, nothing new growing, no animals.

Not mites it anything, to make sure we bathed him 3 times.

Thing is, it doesn't seem to be bothering him, he's not scratching it, I've even spent hours watching him on the security cameras, he's not phased.

Anyway, in the last week or two he's started walking up at 2-3am, and just woofing utterly off chops, almost like nothing can calm him down.

I essentially need to push him to the floor, get down and cuddle him until he calls down and knows he's safe.

Problem is, his panic woofing at 3am sets off all the other dogs around us, so calming him down is sometimes reliant on the neighbours dealing with their dogs.

He does have a crate, which we do use as his ""safe space"", and for a few nights we would take off our day clothes, and throw them in his crate so he would be surrounded by our smells and feel comfortable.

This worked for 3 days, he would lie comfortably on our dirty clothes, and we got a good night's sleep, until that stopped working.

We've tried valerian root at the vets recommendation, however that also worked for a few nights, then it stopped working.

Googling it seems to result in ""doomscrolling"", he's got a brain tumour, he's got doggy dementia, he's losing his marbles, etc.

But none of that fits when it's not 3am...

Plus the X-Ray looked normal, surprisingly, turns out he does have a brain, just doesn't use it.

Maybe an MRI might show more 🤷‍♂️

He runs around fine, is alert and attentive, he remembers where he left all his toys, if we move one and he doesn't know, he searches for it thoroughly and in a sensible manner.

His vision is great, he can find a green tennis ball in green grass no worries, tracks it as you throw it, antipates.

It's not hearing, as he hears you, just continues to be the obstinate cattle Dog he's always been, giving you the side eye as he continues being naughty.

He also is irked by, but not in pain, by loud noises. Turned up an action film so it was uncomfortable for us, and it was uncomfortable for him, but showed no signs that you'd expect from ruptured/inflamed eardrums, just moaning ""Dad, that's too loud""

He's got no discharge from his ears that you'd expect from an infection either.

Hell, I'm here at the suggestion of the vet, he even said ""Got us stuffed, maybe ask the internet if they've seen anything like this, might give us a further idea where to look, as all our tests show he's a 100% healthy dog, but we don't know his Environment, or what to look for there beyond the obvious""

So I'll definitely be discussing any advice here with the vet, as all 3 vets at the surgery are as stumped as his tail.

I mean, they love seeing him, and even to the point we've gone in so maby times he doesn't hate the vet, it's essentially a car ride where he gets treats at the end! You want a blood test, I'll trade you treats for my blood! Yes! That's an acceptable exchange.",cryptocurrency,1648771192.0
