personalfinance,Help me choose what to invest in for my 401k (Fidelity) and how much should I contribute?,"Hi guys so I just got a full time job that pays 19.29 an hour and after 6 months I get an additional 1.50 on top. Anyways I also get a 401k with Fidelity but I was just wondering what I should invest in within it and how much should I contribute. Should I contribute 6, 8, 10, or 15 percent? 

Little information about me if that matters. I am a 24 year old that recently graduated college with no debt. I might go back to college in the future for a different degree as the current one I have has poor job prospects.

The only bill I have is my car bill which has $8,400 left on it and I pay 186 a month.

stocks,"What does Capitulation look like (on Reddit, Youtube, MSM)?","Was not actively trading back in 2020, so I'm not familiar. Looking for insight from those who have been there before, 2008 especially.

I've seen people on MSM say they're expecting at least two 50s, possibly a 75 point hike. A few fund managers said they're waiting for capitulation and that we'll see demand dry up and indiscriminate selling when it happens. Was the last 2 weeks very far off that? 

Fintube/Reddit seems bearish as well, though admittedly I don't see mass posts where everyone is ""giving up and sitting out"". Most seemed optimistic of a possible turn around after the FOMC meeting this week, until that Jpow thing on CNBC a couple weeks ago where he mentioned Volcker. Now, I'm seeing the word ""Recession"" getting mentioned more and more.

I get it, things aren't great and the real estate market could be next.

# What does this have to do with crypto

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest things the SEC tries to use against crypto is that it is possible these are securities, and this makes ICO illegal for 97% of citizens to invest in. 

Like the SEC wants to make crypto as a security as we all know. This means they are a unregistered security. Accredited investors can invest into unregistered securities

And making it where everyone is an accredited investor doesn't work because those selling unregistered securities have to do diligence prior to sale to make sure the person is an accredited investor. Where as the abolishment on this laws removes this un-needed hoop if we were to make everyone an accredited investor anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Simply removing this part of the law from the books basically takes away the SEC power IN THIS ARGUMENT. Like there is other things the SEC does do, but this is the biggest thing the SEC tries to use against us.

If you want to check out the law on this that is causing this problem [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.501](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.501)",cryptocurrency,1651365110

Last time it was just a cycle running its course. There was no major threat of WW3 (at not like the current situation with Russia and Ukraine), there was no worries about rising inflation due to interest rate hike and there was no fear of possible global recession.

All the above factors would weaken the stability of fiat currencies specially dollar, weakening of USD would be devestating simply because it has a global reach.

After spiking massively during 2020 (covid years) as people were stuck in home and had a lot of spare income that they could allocate towards savings and investments, it has now crashed as cost of living expenses shot upwards.

What does this mean for crypto investors, or any investor? In simple terms, less and less money is out there waiting to buy the dips. March 2021's favourite stock or coin is down 80% from ATH? Very few are interested in touching it right now, as many dont have the savings to allocate towards investments.

UPDATE: thank you everyone for the great advice! I ended up calling my leasing department and explained the situation and they were super understanding about it!

stocks,"The stock market is the greatest tool to build wealth, if you're patient.","Look everyone's portfolio is likely looking red, so here's what you need to do: Likely doing nothing for now is the right move. Don't sell at a loss. Work more hours so you have more money to buy solid, economy defining stocks at a fraction of their price they once were and build your retirement portfolio. (PYPL for example, way oversold with a 26 RSI). Downward pressure (bear market) is not forever and doesn't last as long as upward momentum (bull market). In the end, stocks of financially healthy companies will continue to go up. They always have and will.

As long as you're patient and investing in solid companies with healthy balance sheets poised for future growth (even if growth slows in 2022), you'll be fine.

The market is forward looking. Once it gets a grip on where the Fed wants to take rates (likely around 2% by year-end with 50bps the first 2 rate hikes and 25bps thereafter). They will then continue to monitor if inflation is going down from CPI data before hiking more. 

Inflation will go down. Odds are we are here at the peak of inflation currently as we sit. Used and new car prices are not as expensive as they once were and are starting to come down. In my opinion I feel the economy will slow down substantially simply as a result of high gas and food prices re-routing what people can or can't spend their money on. 

Covid for the majority of the world except China has pretty much subsided. People will go out and spend money, that's a given. However, they will be limited on how much they can go out and spend due to the increase in food and gas. Once consumer spending decreases, inflation will also decrease. 

Prices of goods only go up if people are willing to pay them. Once people stop paying sky high prices for assets and commodities, prices will come back down. I think this will happen relatively soon.

A simple look at the stock market is a prime example. The market is forward looking like I said. People are not willing to pay high multiples of companies due to slower growth in the future. Any slowdown in future growth in a company's quarterly earnings will drive the stock price down. Why? People don't want to pay high prices for a company that's not growing as fast, and nor should they. 

The Fed technically hasn't even done anything beside 'threaten' to raise rates so far. But a hawkish Fed (an aggressive rate hike minded Fed), is scary to the market. If they hike rates too aggressively and slow down the economy too much, then we'll have a recession (albeit a short one in my opinion, but inflation would cease to exist pretty much instantly going this route). 

So far all we have endured is a 25bps hike. With the current Fed rate at 0.25%. Likely to go up to 0.75% on Tuesday, May 3rd. But if they say they want to tighten rates more aggressively than 50bps, the market will naturally have a huge negative reaction because a future priced market does not like slow growth. However this route will end inflation quicker, so the market can go back to normal once the dust settles.

Again, all the Fed has done so far is mostly talk. They haven't really taken much action yet as far as tightening goes. I'd say the market is currently pricing in Fed rates of around 3% which is taking us well into 2023. Which means by 2023 the market will start pricing in growth for 2024. This is when I think the growth will resume its bullish trajectory. Until then we are likely to remain volatile. 

TLDR: Long story short, be patient. Do not stress over what you cannot control. Let the Fed do their job and you do yours. Earn money. Control the budget and buy the dip if you have the means to do so. Real wealth is built during markets like this. Once the bull market resumes, make sure you are on the train.",finance,1651401953

personalfinance,Sit on it or cut and run?,"Lance and Adrianne need some financial guidance.

SETUP

They sold a home in a hot market on the west coast, moved out east and now own a total of three properties a small ~$225k townhome that they rent, a ~$700k condo they use as a primary residence, but are planning to put on the seasonal (summer)rental market. Finally, they just purchased a ~$475k home in a southern state they’ll live in as a primary residence while renting the others out.

Seasonal rent on the 700 condo will equal the yearly obligation (mortgage, tax, ins , etc), monthly rent on the 250 townhome yields ~$6k in profit annually - BUT - the tenant has a poor payment history (and the state they live in is NOT landlord friendly).

IF they sold both rental properties now, they would walk away with ~$450k (profit + original dp) that they could use to invest, save, buy more property - essentially diversify.

While Adrianne has been building normally on her 401k, Lance has NO retirement fund and, in his early 50s, is worried about retirement and sees the 700 condo as a long-term investment (he’s also started to contribute maximums into his 401k)

Both have stellar credit (&gt;760), low CC debt, only one car, and work remote. Combined income is ~$245k

CONUNDRUM:

The question is - given the rise in interest rates, low inventory, high pricing - do they stay put and rent out both 700 condo and 250 townhome, or sell in the hot market and diversify elsewhere?",finance,1651412682

personalfinance,"The bank approved me for a mortgage based on my current income, but I am concerned about income reduction and still being able to afford it. What is the minimum I can be making?","I am trying to figure out realistically how much of a house I can afford.

The bank already approved the construction loan based on my income. But I need to know if it is realistic the amount they approved. And if I can afford it if I would lose some of my income.

Some background.

I am currently 38 and own my own business. My current annual take-home before taxes varies each year, but it is in the $550k-$650k range. Of that, about $140k is payroll while the rest is a k1.  This is in New Jersey, but I am not sure what my take home after all taxes (federal and local are).   I currently have in the bank, about $2.5M in savings. (This is with all my taxes paid, etc...). My only debts are car payments, kids' tuition, and mortgage, which are included in my annual expenses below.

My current annual expenses, including the mortgage on my current house, are about $120-$140k.  This includes food, clothing, gas, etc... When I do move into my new house, I would be renting out the current house for more than my mortgage. The current mortgage with taxes is about $22k annually

The construction costs on the house are about $2.9M and this is with purchasing the property, etc...  I am approved for a $1.9M loan at 3.65% and I am supposed to cover the rest out of my pocket.

Assuming everything goes according to plan (and I am adding a 10% cost overun), and not counting any new income, by the time I am finished with my construction, I will have $1.2M in savings left.

With taxes and homeowners insurance, my annual payments on my new house will be about $147k per year. If I keep to the same expenses as previously and remove the previous mortgage and taxes.(butI know some things will go up, such as utillites), my new annual expenses will be about, $245k -  $265k.  To be on the safe side, let me add on a 15% increase in expeses over the next 5 years, so that will being me up to $281K-$304k

I do have investment properties that are bringing in some income as well, but I am keeping those out of this math for the time being. And they are not included in the $550l-$650k income from above.

According to the bank, I can afford this mortgage.

CryptoCurrency,After weeks of research I think there is enough evidence out there to prove that a sophisticated attack is being executed on crypto which is orchestrated by the central bank of Netherlands &amp; CBE with the sole purpose of suppressing crypto prices. Here are my findings.,"# Objective: Ending bitcoin's four year cycles and their effect on the wider crypto markets

Bitcoin's halving cycles are the prime target because they are the main catalyst behind all crypto bull cycles. When bitcoin rallies, fresh capitals flow into crypto, and those seeking higher returns flow from bitcoin into altcoins with emerging narratives. When a bull cycle ends most of these profits then flow back into bitcoin and a fraction of these into fiat and stablecoins. As inflation materialises, it exposes more of the flaws and corrupt nature of central bank controlled fiat currencies. As result the incentive for capitals to jump back in crypto, or stay in crypto altogether by parking in stablecoins, is/will be stronger at the end of the current cycle than it was at the end of any of the earlier cycles where expansionary monetary policy was at an earlier stage. Vis-a-vis increasingly inflationary fiat currencies and never ending expansionary monetary policies, non inflationary cryptos such as bitcoin become a natural hedge against inflation as they allow savers to preserve more of their purchase power.

Less people using fiat currencies undermines the authority of central banks. CBs are the strings through which big private banks and corporations (puppeteers) pull the strings of politicians and policymakers (puppets). To maintain their power and relevance banks will not go down without a fight, and putting up a good fight is what they are doing, especially in the EU. Banks' mission is to strangulate a competitor that generates more value for society, crypto, and for this they have come up with a doctrine on where and how to hit crypto.

# The Ideologue

The chief ideologue is [Alex De Vries](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-De-Vries), an analyst of the central bank of Netherlands and founder of the anti crypto blog [Digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/). De Vries is also a researcher of the University Vrije of Amsterdam. By going through his research papers on Researchgate, I found out that he has been obsessed with the idea of ending bitcoin's halving cycles to undermine its profitability for holders and role as inflation hedge. He has re-affirmed it over and over in all possible mediums, not just academic but also in political and financial salons as well as (pseudo) procrypto conferences such as Consensys.

In one of his latest statements, commenting on crypto's climate footprint debate and the role bitcoin could have in climate change, De Vries has listed the 2 ways in which Europe could contain (capitals flows into) crypto without upsetting the US crypto players, investment funds and corporations that have added crypto to their balance sheets:

1. Taxation and transaction limits
2. Implementing trading restrictions against some cryptos (bitcoin)

Pertaining the first weapon, we are already seeing laws &amp; regulation to kyc unhosted wallets and eventually roll out additional limits that were unthinkable before. This [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/04/24/target-the-bitcoin-price-internal-documents-reveal-how-the-eu-could-try-to-ban-bitcoin-and-protect-ethereum/?sh=6efeb9e27201) is also revealing as it discusses pushes from lobbyists to orient policymakers towards measures that discourage activities that could act as a price catalyst for bitcoin by encouraging traders to orient towards ethereum instead. The excuse is, of course, climate change. In reality however the reason is that Ether was always designed to have a limited upside price wise.

# Why crypto bull cycles undermine the stability of the Euro (but not the USD)

As explained in the above paragraphs, Europe is the epicenter of the efforts of anti-crypto strategies meant to discourage adoption and create entry barriers for capitals looking to enter crypto markets. The ultimate objective of the guidelines published by the DNB and CBE is to make crypto less profitable by breaking the halving cycles. If crypto stops being profitable for *hodlers,* they could still be used as a store of value, as it happens in the US, but without doing too much damage to the euro. It is this principle on which Fabio Panetta's most recent statement stands:

&gt;[We should make faster progress if we want to ensure that crypto-assets do not trigger a lawless frenzy of risk-taking.](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220425~6436006db0.en.html)

Fabio Panetta is a member of the executive council of the European Central Bank. What Mr Panetta means with *lawless frenzy of risk taking* is nothing less than price rallies that would allow savers to obtain higher profits by investing in crypto than by investing their savings in traditional investment vehicles controlled by the institution in whose executive board Mr Panetta sits. Obviously, dinosaurs like Mr Panetta that have abused with impunity European savers and the European middle class for decades, are horrified by the prospects of crypto adoption. It is a simple matter of competition not only against crypto, but also against the US dollar. In fact with every bull cycle more capitals flow into crypto and with profit taking most of capitals that originated from euro are then parked into US dollars. The main reason for this is the absence of any euro stablecoins (there are some, but with negligible adoption).

This flight of capitals at every bull cycle is another reason why European banks (spearheaded by the ECB and DNB) are more wary of crypto than their US counterparts. The US Treasury is well aware of this mechanism and the positive effect it has on the US dollar.

# The difference between the US and EU crypto approach

The influence on crypto markets from the EU and US are different because while in the US we see increasing institutional involvement, in the EU it is the retail market to have expanded most in the past couple of years. US institutional adoption has contributed to minimise crypto volatility mainly through the emergence of institutional investors, that act as long term hodlers. Another mechanism is the fact that having the US become the global crypto mining hub, US miners have more access to capital markets and don't need to sell their coins on the spot. This displacement of spot markets from Asia into the US has/will stabilise prices further limiting also the upside since crashes are one of the strong catalysts for higher highs. I've found [Katie Talatie's](https://www.ar.ca/blog/author/katie-talati) comments on the impact of US markets on crypto particularly enlightening in this sense.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n4nq0hbb7ww81.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c26e0b61a453b203e26fd283d95e79c717a45d9

Talati explains best what she is closest to, the dynamics of US crypto markets. In Europe the situation is different, as shown also in the above chart, retail adoption/activity prevails in European markets. This is why in Europe the optics are different and non inflationary cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are seen as a double threat to the euro, because try also facilitate capital flights into usd. This brings us back to the second weapon proposed by De Vries to limit the impact/competitiveness of crypto against the euro without upsetting US players, that is that of limiting/restricting the trading of bitcoin (the most hated crypto by EU banks). It won't be long before we see some laws in this regard in EU.

# Conclusion

Every crypto enthusiast, especially in the EU, should be aware of the sophisticated attack orchestrated and executed by the DNB and ECB against crypto. This attack is happening right under everyone's nose and is aimed at keeping europeans backed in a corner with no choice but to keep their wealth in euros, from where it can be siphoned off/stolen through inflation. It is likely that other regulators around the globe will copy these strategies or become more receptive to them. While I believe that crypto markets will eventually shake them, I think this will be a long war as regulators and banks won't give up easy. \`**Beware and distance yourself of politicians or political parties that are aligned to these policies.** This is a fight that has to be fought by today's population of crypto enthusiasts. We need to keep exposing and educating.

Another attack vector is privacy. As people opt out of the euro, surveillance laws like the proposed last month on unhosted wallets, should become more frequent and more invasive. As many surveys by the European Commission itself have shown however (chart below), privacy is where the efforts to strangulate crypto are more likely to become a political issue because europeans, even those who are not necessarily into crypto today, value privacy more than anything else when it comes to their finances.

**TLDR**: The current anti crypto EU regulations are based on a doctrine by Alex De Vries, a DNB analyst and University researcher, who argues that breaking bitcoin's halving price rally cycles is the most effective way for europeans to undermine crypto adoption. He specifically proposes taxing/limiting crypto transactions and implementing trade restrictions against certain cryptos.",cryptocurrency,1651423935

stocks,"Don't worry, be happy! Keep investing!","I was using a compound interest calculator (an old freeware version I had) and I decided today to look at some WORST (well reasonably worst I believe) case scenarios using low savings rates and being FULLY invested (no cash) and continually investing all along.

I used a very manageable (in most people's cases I would assume) small sum of $200 a month.  I wanted to use extremes for my point and figured $200 was something even people with tight budgets could afford.

So I started with an initial $50k investment.  Some may start with only $5000 or $10000 or $0 it doesn't matter.

So I also dialed in an interest rate of only 3% assuming a very low rate of return.  It's still not beating inflation in real terms but is what it is. Again these are imo worst case scenarios.  For all I know the sp500 could be at 2500 5 years from now but I would hope not.

So with a starting initial deposit of $50k and $200 a month after 5 years I ended up with $70706. Deposits of $12k over those 5 years and interest of $8706.

If I changed the contribution rate to $433 a month or $5200 a year I ended up with $85550 after 5 years.

So assuming the sp500 is at 4100 now and the 5 year return is 15% total the sp500 would be at 4715 5 years from now.


I would assume this is a very worst case scenario.

For example a lot of my portfolio is in names like MSFT AAPL and UNH etc.  I'm sceptical that those stocks will only return 15% total in 5 years.

So I think it helps to have maybe 50% in something like VTI and maybe the rest made up of blue chip large caps like MSFT GOOGL AAPL NVDA ASML UNH HD SHW etc. Maybe only 10 to 15 or so stocks total.

So my advice is to keep investing and to think 5 years out and ignore all the short term noise.

Yes, I'm currently almost 50% cash and looking for a 3500 entry point into VTI to begin adding, but the easiest thing would probably be to just keep adding into VTI regularly and ignore everything!",finance,1651429418

I am a high income earner but also have a lot of student debt (refinanced to 1.9%) and live in a high cost of living city.

Is it worth purchasing a condo in the 650k range, putting a decent chunk of change down if I can still get an interest rate in the 5-6 range? Vs continuing to rent (2.5k a month). 

A condo would involve additional condo association fees (1.2k a month plus additional taxes ~7k a year) 

Doing some calculations it seems like the condo value would have to double for me to break even if i were to sell it in 15 years, taking into account interest as well as associated fees. Am I thinking about this correctly? 

I could probably put down even more but I would like to have cash on hand in case I have to move for work in the next year or two, in which case I would have to buy a house, as I would probably move to a more ritual area.

personalfinance,Your Mortgage and Common Servicing Questions,"I see many posts on here and legal advice relating to people having mortgage issues. in addition so many issues I see daily are simply a lack of general mortgage information. 

So let me start. Hi I'm Myrati. I have worked loan originations, then 12 years is post foreclosure, and currently 2 years in Customer Written Escalations.  Hopefully I can give you some good information relating to Complaints, Payments, Escrow, and Loss Mitigation.

Unfortunately the CFPB is not a magic bullet it gets the credit for on Legal Advice and PF. The magic bullet confused for being CFPB is simply the detailed written request. 

Lets cover the basics:  
Originator: Institution that you applied to and gave you the loan originally.  
Investor: Institution/Entity that owns your loan.  
Servicer: Company that services your loan on behalf of the investor. (People you pay)QWR (Qualified Written Request): Your written complaint about a servicing issue. We have 30 days to respond. Do not expect a response within days.

On Personal Finance and Legal Advice I always see people answer a mortgage question with ""Contact the CFPB, your bank is scared of them."" Now some parts of their advice is correct. CFPB complaints go to a specific team. This team is usually made up of people with far significant experience than the standard customer service rep you reach when you call. This team will know everything from origination through foreclosure. In many cases that can waiver 50/50 on servicer vs customer error, they have the authority to make the determination.

However all these same qualifications exist on the normal Escalations team. In fact for most servicers the ""regulations"" team is just a handful of the escalations team assigned to just state and fed regulatory request, such as CFPB, local Attorney Generals, ect. The ""magic bullet"" people claim is the CFPB, is the detailed written request you send the CFPB. Most of the time you will send the servicer a copy that you also sent the CFPB. The majority of these I get, I resolve before the CFPB team has even received the forwarded copy from CFPB.

The key is to provide a well written request, that includes your complaint and any supporting documentation. If you reference a letter or call, be specific. When did the call happen and who did you talk to. When is the letter dated and what is a summary of the letter. If the document you're referencing even remotely looked fishy, provide us a copy so we can verify we sent it. If providing proof of payment, referencing a credit report, tax installment, or any other ""bill"", provide us a copy of the full document, all pages. No one is going to care if you spent $200 on wifugacha monthly. Were only looking for our payment. If the docs are missing, you're just going to get a reply asking for it. 

Next, review all your mail from your servicer. The majority of our complaints to escrow and insurance issues, we've already told them what we need. For example, your insurance policy declaration page names your significant other, that's not on a borrower, as the named insured, so we need that updated. Or insurance is missing the mortgagee clause. Or we sent you a notice that your escrow increased. 

Therefore our response would be resending another copy, and maybe a little more personal explanation.

When working with a QWR understand the associate working your issue may be knowledgeable to fix your error, but we cannot fix other departments ourselves. Though I can manage the correction process to ensure its completed, I still have to open tasks and address the issue with the department directly. This may take time. Trust me we would love it too if we could force them to drop what they are doing and respond to us. There is a reason we have 30 days to respond.

We were approved 315k with a flat 5% interest rate. She works at a bank and was able to get that rate along with bank fees being waived. We've been told we are lucky to have what we have, but we really would like to get into a house. 

We originally wanted to have our mortgage be about 1800 a month (Both make roughly 87k, bring home 4.8k after taxes) but considering taxes and insurance, we've been calculating and seeing calculators online give us the $2100-$2300 mark, which would be hitting close to our 50% of our bring home pay. 

Question is: Would it be better for us to buy now or save and possibly have a higher interest rate down the line, essentially ""chasing the market?"" We really don't want to be house poor.",finance,1651465549

CryptoCurrency,Accelerate the world's transition to cryptocurrency,"Now I understand the masterplan from CDC. I think they had to pull the plug earlier than expected due to the general situation with respect to regulation and economy, but with a better execution it would have succeeded at the complete world's transition to cryptocurrency. Here are the steps I have noticed:

1. Create one of the best off ramps from crypto. Make the on ramp a no brainer in that context. When people on the fence of crypto see people paying with crypto, they do not think of the fiat they would spend on crypto, but the fiat they would not spend when paying with a card. This in itself is brilliant, I hope to see a psychologist analyze it further.
1. Invest with one of the most aggressive marketing budgets ever seen in crypto. CDC is _crypto.com_, if you don't go to crypto, crypto will go to you through ads. If you block your ads, it will be surrounding you, in a stadium. Elon Musk can praise Dogecoin, CDC will get The Martian for the marketing. Get everybody in cryptocurrency. (While this marketing campaign was at full throttle, it was not over, but recent events required the transition to stage 3).
1. Remove the off ramp! Now everybody stays in cryptocurrency, there is no way out! It is not about the money, it is about sending a message: ""you have no control over centralized platforms: the way they work can change at any instant, and will change constantly, it is not defined by an algorithm or a community.""

(Note: CDC cards still exist, stage 3 is not complete yet)

With the current hawk monetary policy, this is the moment for the painful lesson: ""Centralized approaches (including fiat) cannot be trusted, embrace decentralization."" CDC has gone through a lot of troubles with arduous work for many years to deliver this message. Finding activists with that kind of commitment is unusual nowadays.",cryptocurrency,1651490899

After 6 years in college I dropped out of university and got a job. While in college as an adult i was diagnosed with autism.  Last fall I was diagnosed with a learning disability and was able to get a math waiver at my local community college. I returned to college at the cc and did my last science course and the math substitute course. Im graduating from cc with my associates degree next week 9 years after I began college. Im 32 years old living paycheck to paycheck in a retail job I hate.  Only 34k a year before taxes.

I lost my food stamps last year and after covid Im losing my low income health insurance so I will have to do co-pays. Rent at my studio apartment is going up by $100 when my lease ends. I have no friends or family to roommate with/move in with. I can only afford to pay anywhere from $50-100 a month in student loan payments. Only when my tax return comes in can I throw a big chunk of cash at it.

I decided to ditch English and changed my major to technical writing. I have a passion for writing and the entry level position of junior technical writer has a starting median salary of $29.00 an hour or almost twice as much as I make now. Even better my university advisor said I only need 11 classes to graduate and can use all the English classes as a minor. They will accept the math waiver.

The bad news is all 11 classes are 300-400 level courses with no cheaper equivalent at cc I can transfer back into university. At my university the 3 credit courses run about $2500 each. Or over $800 a credit hour. At cc its only $80 a credit hour. 10 times as much.

I dont want more debt and I have reached my federal loan limit anyway. I could probably take out loans for only 1 more semester at best but I dont want to do that. I am getting help with the universities disability resource center with writing scholarships. I am working with an employment agency to find a better paying job.

My question is should I just pay off all the debt then save money for college or should I take out loans and try and save up for college now, hope I can get some scholarships, forget the debt and get through school then get the junior tech writing job and attack that debt?

cybersecurity,Have a final onsite interview for a dream role with FAANG next week. Please help,"So I've been doing service desk for the past year and a half; I picked up my Net +, Sec +, and AWS SAA in that time. I recently applied for some cloud security support roles with a FAANG and have made it to a final onsite interview next week (4-5 hours). Before this, I only had a brief call with my recruiter after completing my online assessment and then a 1hr technical screening (only network and sec questions, no coding).  

I am very nervous about this last interview as it sounds like it will be intense with the technical questioning, and I've been told to expect some coding questions. My coding is not that great, I know some Python, but it's been a long time since I used it regularly. I guess my question is what I should be doing more to prepare for the technical portion of these last rounds and precisely what I should practice in terms of coding.  

While I have been doing a lot of self-learning this past year, my help desk role has felt more like a mailroom than an IT role (especially with the last few months as I've mostly been training new hires), and I'm worried they won't think my experience translates well enough. I also realize I could have given more information to clarify this, but unfortunately, I don't have much else to share. Any advice is appreciated, and thanks all!

# [Stock futures fall after the Nasdaq posts worst month since 2008](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Monday morning after the Nasdaq Composite Index posted its worst month since 2008, pressured by rising rates, rampant inflation and underwhelming earnings from some of the largest technology companies.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 30 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures were shed 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The major averages sank on Friday, accelerating April’s losses. The Dow dropped 939 points during the session, bringing its loss last week to roughly 2.5%. It was the 30-stock benchmark’s fifth-straight negative week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 declined 3.63% on Friday, its worst day since June 2020, and posted its fourth-straight negative week for the first time since September 2020. The Nasdaq also posted a fourth-straight week of losses, after falling 4.2% on Friday. Both indexes registered their lowest closing levels of the year.
*****
&gt; “As we turn the calendar to May, we may see a short-term oversold bounce, however, we still have several reasons for concern. We believe our longer-term equity indicators are not yet oversold enough to have a high conviction ‘Buy’ call. We also believe managers have started to re-price stocks using recession like multiples. If that is the case, we are still over-valued,” MKM Partners chief market technician JC O’Hara said in a note clients.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are coming off their worst month since March 2020, when the pandemic took hold. The Dow finished April 4.9% lower, while the S&amp;P tanked 8.8%.
*****
&gt; The selling was even more extreme in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which plunged 13.26% in April, its worst month since October 2008. The steep decline follows underperformance from large tech companies, including Amazon, Netflix and Meta Platforms.
*****
&gt; “Disappointing guidance from technology giants Amazon and Apple have exacerbated concern that a decidedly more hawkish Fed, coupled with still intractable supply chain issues, and rising energy prices may make the hope of a ‘soft landing’ from the Fed more elusive,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; Netflix fell 49% last month, with Amazon and Meta losing 24% and 10.8%, respectively. Tech stocks have been hit especially hard since their often-elevated valuations and promise of future growth begin to look less attractive in a rising-rate environment.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee will issue a statement on monetary policy. The decision will be released at 2 p.m. ET, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell holding a press conference at 2:30 p.m.
*****
&gt; “With inflation so high and earnings growth slowing rapidly, stocks no longer provide the inflation hedge many investors are counting on. Real earnings yield tends to lead real stock returns on a y/y basis by about 6 months. It suggests we have meaningful downside at the index level as investors figure this out,” Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Another key economic indicator will come Friday when April’s jobs report is released.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is now more than halfway finished, but a number of companies are set to post results in the coming week, including a host of consumer-focused restaurant and travel companies.
*****
&gt; Expedia, MGM Resorts, Pfizer, Airbnb, Starbucks, Lyft, Marriott, Yum Brands, Uber eBay and TripAdvisor are just some of the names on deck.
*****
&gt; Of the 275 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 80% have beat earnings estimates with 73% topping revenue expectations, according to data from Refinitiv.

I'm 34M, single with no dependants and $35,000 in student loan debt. I'm an alcoholic who until yesterday was sober for 5 days, which is the longest I've been sober since I was a teenager.

Estimated monthly expenses:
- Rent+utilities: $465 (Yeah, I know, please just save it. Please.)
- Car insurance: $80
- Car payments: None, I bought a clunker in cash
- Health/dental insurance: $250
- Renter's insurance: $20
- Food: $750-$1000
- Credit card: $4000 balance (up from 0, which was down from $11,000). Minimum monthly payment is currently $89.
- Internet: $110 -Subscriptions: Probably $50
- Phone plan: $100
- Misc: Maybe $200

I'm not so much asking for budgeting advice as I am for general life-planning advice. I was hoping to be able to afford a down payment on a house within the year, but it's looking like I'll have to push that off indefinitely with the way housing prices have been. In the meantime, my living situation is miserable. My room is the size of a prison cell (although probably cheaper than one) and it's where I've been working from since Covid started, which is killing my mental health. I've had to deal with roommates OD'ing in the bathroom, stealing my stuff, and so much generally psychotic behavior that it could be its own post. I've had cops pounding on my door and threatening to charge me with harboring a fugitive if I didn't tell them where my roommate was. I've had my car broken into, and one of my roommates slashed my other roommates' tires over something he completely imagined.

Anyway, for $465, you can imagine what it's like. But the point is, I'm sick of living here and I want to get out, but I don't know if I can justify moving because the rent's so cheap and I'm saving a lot of money. I can hardly find a single 2 bed 1 bath in the country for less than $2000, and I really want to avoid or at least mitigate lifestyle inflation. I also frankly don't want to rent anymore. I want to start building some equity, and I'd rather not have my gains eaten up by predatory rental companies.

To preempt the inevitable comments about food/credit card debt:

- I can't cook for myself because there are 7 people in this house and only one fridge. I know how to cook and eat cheap and I even have a subscription to Costco so I can buy in bulk, but even if there was fridge space, I wouldn't cook anyway because I want to avoid my roommates and they'd probably just end up eating it. However, if I moved into a new apartment I could probably save up to $1k a month on food, which is why I'm considering it.

- I'm not concerned about the credit card debt. I've paid it off once and I can do it again, and I have a 771 credit score. It's pretty much entirely related to my food situation. It has a low interest rate and I would rather focus on building up my savings.

I don't have anyone in my life to go to for advice like this, so obviously the next best thing is to consult the collective wisdom of internet strangers. What would you do? Should I stick it out and take advantage of the insanely cheap rent until I can afford my own place? Or should I move into an overpriced apartment for the sake of my mental health and food budget?",finance,1651498341

personalfinance,I Savings Bonds - Will My Rate Increase with May?,"Hey there Gurus,

In March I purchased $10K of I Savings Bonds at the current rate of 7.12%. This month, May, the rate will be updated. In speculation, most investors seem to believe that it will be going to around 8-9%. My question is, will my bond rate update with the new rate? (even if it goes down...)

Here's some language from their website which peeks some questions.

* The interest is **compounded semiannually**. Every six months from the bond's issue date, interest the bond earned in the six previous months is added to the bond's principal value, creating a new principal value. Interest is then earned on the new principal.
* The composite rate for I bonds issued from **November 2021 through** **April 2022** is **7.12 percent**. **This rate applies for the first six months you own the bond.**

Based upon the second paragraph, it seems like I've locked a 7.12% for the first 6 months, regardless of the interest rate changes that come in during this month.

Is this correct, or will my rate update as soon as the bond rate changes?

Thanks!

Bitcoin,How to answer “why Bitcoin?”,"When trying to explain the concept of bitcoin everyone needs to know that it’s a solution to a problem. To truly understand the purpose you need to explain the current technology that underpins money and how Bitcoin improves on it and why the improvements are good/ what they achieve. 

I like to use a scenario where you ask someone if they go to work for 40h a week what are they doing that for?. You are exchanging your energy for money. The money is like a battery you can use to store your economic energy. If you made $10k in a year which you saved in 2010, you just stored $10k worth of economic energy in that year. If you saved that money until today, your savings would be worth $4200 in the USA if we don’t account for the low interest rates. Why work so god damn hard at your job if the work you’re doing isn’t being stored properly and is leaking out really quickly? If you get pissed off for losing half your weekly pay because you damaged your car, you begin to appreciate the time value of money. And if everyone lost half their pay over 12 years for doing nothing, I don’t think they’d be happy if they heard that. 

It really sucks that we don’t have any other option other than to use this cash as money. But wait, we can use bitcoin instead! Instead of working 40h a week every week and earning $1000 to have it depreciate at increasing rates, why not store that economic energy you have generated on bitcoin which will protect that energy forever? By mathematical design, the value of your economic energy stored in bitcoin will always go up as long as people are demanding it. Once everyone understands that bitcoin is a safe haven where you can store your wealth, it will be highly demanded.

It’s a really simple concept to understand. You have to introduce the idea then that CPI which determines how much value the government thinks your money lost is flawed. It doesn’t make sense not to include everything consumers demand in an inflation calculation. By expending your energy as a human being and then being subject to inflation is essentially just sucking the life force out of you as you struggle to earn a living. Anyone that has held predominantly more cash for the last few decades has become increasingly poorer  as the fiat system promotes the division of wealth in the economy.

Explain the idea, the problem, the solution and what the solution does. 

Then make it personal. No one likes being robbed of their life force.",cryptocurrency,1651501479

CryptoCurrency,"What has changed about BTC, ETH, and most cryptos' tech? Nothing. What has changed about the volatility? Nothing. What has changed about the way the market is trading? Nothing. The one thing that has changed is the increase in adoption. So are we really that worried long term?","And like every year, we have a new round of doom and gloom news.

Last year it was Evergrande and Omicron which were supposedly gonna plunge us into 2008 2.0.

This year it's Fed rate hikes and the war in Ukraine.

Which do have legitimate concerns.

Just like I explained in my past post on how Evergrande's causes were a little overblown, and digging into the data a 2008 2.0 wasn't as probable as the news made it out to be.

A recession is definitely possible. We could have a 2008 crash from here.

But once again, it may not be as probable, much less a 100% certainty, as so many people try to paint it.

For instance, while Fed rates are increasing, they are not increasing to the point where cost of borrowing will be too high. They are only increasing from near 0, to the same rates we had pre-covid. So the cost of borrowing will be higher, but still dirt cheap, and still at historic lows.

&amp;#x200B;

# Is there any issues on the tech side?

Whether there will be a fallout or not, when thinking about what you will do long term, think about what has changed about the tech.

When you invest in something like crypto, you are essentially investing in a software and tech solution. You are investing into a network with a powerful algorithm called the blockchain. And you find value in this because of problems it can solve.

And crypto solves a lot more problems than people realize.

It's even use by companies worldwide to to solve business problems.

Blockchain is more powerful than people realize.

Whether that problems is creating decentralized money and currency that removes corruption and gives you control, or makes you your own bank, gives you a store of value, an international currency, a solution for money transfer...or even goes beyond that and solves problems for the financial industry, financial technologies, for supply chains, IOT, web 3.0, databases, oracles, AI, scientific research, healthcare, agriculture, inventory, logisitcs etc...

In either case, the value derives from what people are able to do with it, and gain from it. Typically in a problem it can solve.

As long as the tech works, the problem can be solved, and increasingly more people and companies are using it to solve those problems, then what has changed?

The only thing that changes is the speculation side.

&amp;#x200B;

# The price swings and volatility is more about speculation than fundamentals.

The speculation is what generates the big price swings.

The price doesn't have a quick peak or dip because suddenly Bitcoin has a change in its tech or utility.

The price will swing because of internal speculation and more about the trading features of the market than the tech features of Bitcoin.

And often, in the case of a dip, it will more likely be a case of a response to the price going up too quickly, and then longs getting liquidated, causing a massive dip.

And the price will then rise quickly again, from an opportunity of the liquidation causing an oversold situation. The response may cause shorts to get liquidated, and the price to quickly go sky high.

And the cycle continues in this high volatility.

And that hasn't changed.

&amp;#x200B;

# Markets don't care about macros as much as people think, much less logic.

It's much more about how many shorts and longs are getting liquidated, how overbought or oversold the market is, how the price has moved, than macro economics or what goes on in the world.

We've seen how China shutting down miners didn't bring the price down, as it was already in oversold and longs were already liquidated. Instead, the market went from $30K to 50K, despite the major negative news.

Even when the market was starting to freakout about the potential fallout of Evergrande last September, with many experts calling it 2008 2.0, Bitcoin went on to find a new ATH. Many people were predicting a financial crisis and major recession.

When war broke out, Bitcoin, which was supposed to tank according to some of the experts, ended up going on a little bullish run.

There's a lot of talks about Bitcoin simply following stocks.

While Bitcoin has recently gone from having next to no correlation to having a little bit more of correlation, that increase in correlation still doesn't make it 1:1 with stocks.

In fact, it hasn't even hit 0.8 in correlation.

It has only been able to occasionally peak at around 0.5-0.6 in correlation, which is only a moderate correlation. Still doing its own thing half the time.

# Conclusion

At the end of the day, traders, quants, bots, aren't trading based on macros, they trade based on supply and demand.

The supply and demand of options contract, derivatives, buy/sell orders. The speculation side and extrinsic value, is where the real money is made. Not the intrinsic, much less the macro economics.

Which is why you often see Wall Street so out of sync with main street. And also why markets seem so irrational.

And that same is happening in crypto. It's the speculation driving the short term trends, and causing all that short term volatility.

Long term, the trend is very clear, and seems to follow more the growing adoption, and the trend of how crypto is increasingly being used by businesses and individuals around the world, as a tech and financial solution.",cryptocurrency,1651507396
defi,Defi Recap,"Hi to all of you

I wanted to share some of my learnings and thoughts for this really big and sometimes complicated sector of finance.

I´´m in crypto space since more than two years. i started with betting on crypto bookies and earned my first satoshis. After a while i standard to read a lot about bitcoin and wanted more  
So i bet more and also did some DCA. Beside that i also tried to get some ETH and other ALTS.  


After the ATH i had 80% of portfolio in *BTC, 10% in ETH and 10% in rest* like ADA,Matic, XRP and other well known.  


Then when the crash came, i hodled all but i lost some trust in many ALTS. 60-70% away from ATH is a lot (i know could change fast), but so many solid projects over the last year, and not so easy that competition is think.  


3 weeks ago, i tried my first steps into DEFI. Cause HODLed Coins are nice, but i guess staked are little bit better.  


**Now the big issue...... WHICH COINS to STAKE?**

My fundamentals like BTC are safed in my Ledger and i wont touch them. From my 5 different CEX i switched all to Binance and wanted to stake also a little amount there. But with these bunch of DEFI platforms, its not that easy. Cause many of the have their own coin, and i´m not so sure to invest in such coins. I want the ""fundamental"" ones.

**Biswap** is one platform where i have invested and staked a small amount. BWS coin seems nice and i wanted to try. APY is ok, and i receive some more BSW, which i will re-stake. Its a kind of fancy platform which i will support next few month.

**Cosmos** \- i read a lot about this Chain and i like ATOM and the Keplr Wallet to stake. 3 Days ago i shifted all my CRO´s to Keplr and staked for 16% - but you all know what CRO did. I have also some KAVA and ROWAN and i will stick to this. I love the Keplr wallet. All in one overview- Nice rewards and quite easy to handle. But i´m not so familiar what ATOM will do in future which next steps and opportunities will occur.  


So thats all and now my to my question and maybe you can help me a little bit.

Which should i try, which platform/coin is solid and after a new Bullrun maybe worth the price. 

**AVAX?** i just read a little bit about this, seems nice. But not sure where to stake? Binance some good % but just low amount is allowed.

**TERRA?** Should i stake the Luna token anywhere? Is this a fundamental one? i guess yes, but not so familiar with it\`? 

**ANCHOR?** I saw the USDT staking with around 16%, seems also nice. Maybe i should add an amount there. Few days ago was 19% :(

**ETH?** I wanted to stake via LIDO but 3% are really low, and the Fee´s would cost a lot. But i believe much in ETH, so i consider this option on the long run as well

What about the rest? 

**ADA,SOL,MATIC?** 

i sold all into BTC, but i´m willing to stake those and buy some orders again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, i´ want more diversity to stake my ALTS. I want to avoid those Coins which are just the earning result of a single platform. Cause the risk of loosing all the stakes are higher than compared to staking the ""big"" ones. Maybe i´m wrong, but i think thats fact.

Thx for reading and have a nice day.",cryptocurrency,1651508411

Next year when I hit my 3-year mark, I will be paid \~$110k/year with 5 weeks of paid vacation.

But I'm afraid the work isn't challenging enough. We're an entirely Excel-based shop and our analytics don't go much deeper than a few pivot tables and bar charts. I have learned enough Python in my spare time to automate my monthly reporting calls and most common ad-hoc requests, so I might be working \~10 hours each week. Because our data architecture is so old, most of my actual ""work"" time is spent exporting .csv files from our database and saving them as the import code for my jupyter notebooks. SQL is not used or supported by our database vendors, and while we are about to launch Power BI, dashboarding will be new to our team (though bc we have no SQL, these dashboards will be built on Excel workbooks.)

Currently, this job will cap out at \~$140k if I stay forever (and that cap will be reached sometime between 9-18 years) and if I want to make more than that I need to find a new job. I think at some point I will want to leave for a FAANG-like senior analytics or data science role that offers better comp and has stronger data pipelines. To prepare for this, I am trying to punch above my job description's weight: I am learning SQL in my spare time, I have experience with inferential stats through my grad school studies and I'm building reports that use the basics like linear regression, I already have a lot of experience with Power BI through grad school, and I've practiced my pandas skills by building jupyter books for others.

My question for the sub is: am I a complete idiot for wanting to leave? I know for a lot of people this is a dream gig, but for the sake of my career I feel like I would have better long-term returns if I used this time to build skills and transition to an analytics/data science gig elsewhere. Is there anything I should be aware of if I want to transition from the public to private sectors?",technology,1651518394

stocks,"$43 billion bet on the oil industry! Entering the market when the stock market plummeted, can Buffett continue to write the legend?","After a lapse of two years, Buffett's shareholders meeting has finally returned to offline.

On April 30, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders was held in Omaha, United States. Buffett and Munger made another appearance together, answering dozens of questions from investors.

At the shareholder meeting, Buffett disclosed Berkshire's investment moves in the first quarter of this year. In the first quarter, Berkshire bought more than $51 billion in stock during the stock market decline, including Chevron, Hewlett-Packard and Occidental Petroleum.

It is worth noting that as early as 2019, Berkshire invested $10 billion to assist Occidental Petroleum in the acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, but chose to liquidate its positions in 2020. This time, Buffett once again bet on the oil industry two years later. Berkshire currently holds more than $43 billion in the oil industry.

Why is Buffett favoring the oil industry again when clean energy has become a long-term global trend? Entering the market when the U.S. stock market fell sharply, can the ""stock god"" continue the investment legend of the past?

**""Big money"" sweeping oil stocks**

Buffett, who holds a large amount of cash, disclosed at the shareholders' meeting that Berkshire's investment operations in the first quarter of this year were to buy and buy quickly.

Heavy positions in oil stocks is one of its most closely watched investment moves this year. Buffett said Berkshire bought about 14% of Occidental's outstanding shares in the first two weeks of March, valued at about $7.2 billion.

According to Berkshire’s 2022 first quarter (Q1) financial report data released on April 30, Berkshire’s investment in Chevron in the first quarter ended March 31 this year amounted to $25.9 billion, equivalent to At the end of the fourth quarter of last year, it held about 159 million shares, a significant increase from about 38 million shares worth $4.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of last year.

In its Q1 earnings report, Berkshire disclosed that its equity securities investments also included Occidental Petroleum's $10 billion worth of perpetual preferred stock, plus its investments in Occidental Petroleum and Chevron in the first quarter, as of the first quarter of this year. By the end of the day, Berkshire's holdings in the oil industry had accumulated to more than $43 billion.

In addition, as one of the ""Big Four"" that drove Berkshire's value last year, the insurance industry once again received Buffett's overweight this year (Note: The other three giants are Apple, Berkshire BNSF Railroad, and BHE Energy. ).

In March, Berkshire bought insurer Alleghany for $11.6 billion, Buffett's largest acquisition in six years. In this year's open letter to shareholders, Buffett said the insurance business is tailor-made for Berkshire, arguing that (insurance) products will never become obsolete and that revenue generally increases with economic growth and inflation.

In addition, Berkshire’s investment actions in the first quarter of this year also included the purchase of 121 million shares of HP, accounting for about 11.4% of the latter’s shares; Buffett also revealed that Berkshire already holds 9.5% of Activision Blizzard’s shares. Equity, it is not ruled out that the position will exceed 10%. As of the end of 2021, Berkshire held 14.66 million shares of Activision Blizzard, or about 2% of the latter, according to SEC filings in February.

In the Q1 earnings report, Berkshire's stock investments were divided into three main categories: banking, insurance and finance, consumer products, and business and other industries. As of the first quarter, Berkshire's total investment was about 66%. Fair value is concentrated in four companies, namely Apple, Bank of America, American Express and Chevron.

According to data released by Berkshire at the end of the fourth quarter of last year, the company's top ten holdings are Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, Moody's, Verizon Communications, United Bank of America, BYD, Chevron, New York Mellon Bank. Chevron has jumped to Berkshire's fourth-largest holding after aggressively adding to the oil industry, while Occidental has become Buffett's ninth-largest holding.

**Occidental Petroleum's Fame Lives Up as a Cash Cow**

In fact, Buffett's layout of the oil industry can be traced back three years ago. In 2019, Buffett agreed to provide $10 billion to assist Occidental Petroleum in its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum. Buffett has said it's a bet on long-term gains in oil prices.

However, after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic in 2020, Buffett liquidated Occidental Oil. In 2020, Occidental Oil once fell to $8.483 per share, the lowest level since 2000. At that year's shareholder meeting, Buffett lamented the investment, calling it a ""mistake"" and said he planned to invest more money in wind and solar.

Why did Buffett significantly increase his holdings of Occidental Oil again two years later? At the shareholders meeting, Buffett said about the huge investment in Occidental Petroleum, which is why Occidental Petroleum's annual report is very good, so he decided to invest in it. He revealed that in the first two weeks of March, he purchased 14% of Occidental's outstanding shares, valued at more than $7 billion. Originally, only 60% of Occidental's shares were tradable.

Buffett also said that the short-term volatility caused by the ""gambling mentality"" in the market since late February has allowed him to find good long-term opportunities. Munger also said that he has finally found a better investment than U.S. Treasuries.

The reporter noticed that since the beginning of this year, Occidental Petroleum's stock price has risen continuously due to the rise in international oil prices and the generous promotion of Buffett. As of the close of U.S. stocks on April 29, the company has risen more than 90% this year.

The investment is almost certainly tied to commodity prices (oil prices), according to Forbes analysis, and as in 2019, Buffett's investment in Occidental Oil remains a long-term bet on oil prices. And from Berkshire's actions to increase its position in Chevron in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, Buffett is increasingly confident in oil prices.

At the same time, Buffett's heavy position in oil stocks happened to be from the end of February to the middle of March, and it was also during the tension between Russia and Ukraine. Russia interrupted some energy supplies to Europe, and global energy prices soared. Disruptions in Russian energy will likely boost the value of U.S. energy production, which, unlike other multinational oil companies, is where Occidental's main oil and gas production happens to be domestic.

Additionally, Occidental is highly sensitive to free cash flow due to its high correlation with oil prices, according to Goldman Sachs. The daily economic news reporter reviewed the report of Occidental Petroleum's 2021 Q4 earnings conference and found that for every US$1/barrel increase in oil prices, the company's annualized cash flow rose by US$225 million. If Goldman's bullish forecast for oil prices is accurate, Occidental could deliver a free cash flow yield of 37% in 2022. Buffett just happens to be very fond of companies that generate huge free cash flow.

Based on Berkshire Energy's (BHE) utilities and pipeline businesses, Buffett may also be considering the possibility of making Occidental a wholly owned Berkshire company, according to Forbes.

**Others fear me greedy**

**Can ""Stock God"" continue to write the legend?**

The escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian situation and the Fed’s hike in interest rates have led to a massive sell-off in U.S. stocks this year. By contrast, Buffett bought more than $51 billion in stock in the first quarter of this year.

This is reminiscent of the 1970s, when the United States was mired in stagflation and was in a recession. Many investors were hit hard by the global stock market crash, but Buffett still delivered outstanding results.

In the 1970s, despite the dilemma of stagflation, stock market speculation was particularly high. Back then, the 50 highly sought-after large-cap stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange were dubbed the ""Pretty 50"" for their steady earnings growth and high price-to-earnings ratios. According to reports, in 1972, driven by institutions, the price-earnings ratio of the ""Nice 50"" reached a high. Polaroid trades at 90 times earnings, McDonald's at 85 times, and Disney at 82 times, compared with the S&amp;P 500's average of 33 times earnings over the same period.

The first oil crisis that followed in 1973 caused the ""Nice 50"" bubble to burst. In the same year, the dollar depreciated further, the Bretton Woods system collapsed, and the market was embattled. However, according to the Caitong Securities Research Institute, during the two oil crises in 1973 and 1977, the S&amp;P 500 index recorded losses, but Buffett had a perfect bear market performance.

Statistics from the institute show that between 1970 and 1976, Buffett achieved a total return of 240.3%, 188.9 percentage points higher than the S&amp;P 500 return, and an annualized return of 19.1%, 13 percentage points higher than the S&amp;P 500 return. ; During the period from 1977 to 1981, Buffett outperformed the market again, achieving a total return of 247.9% and an annualized return of 28.3%, which were 203.7 and 20.7 percentage points higher than the S&amp;P 500.

According to the analysis of the aforementioned research, the reason why Buffett was able to win in the 1970s was the precise timing. Specifically, in the 1970s, the United States reached its industrial peak, and raw materials were booming. Buffett bought Caesars Aluminum and made a profit of 600%; in the early 1980s, interest rates in the United States soared, and Buffett aggressively allocated insurance and finance.

In addition, Buffett's bottom-hunting action is also one of the important decisions to achieve his legendary investment life. In 1969, when a recession loomed and the market was overvalued, Buffett temporarily retired. After the two oil crises in 1973 and 1977, Buffett bought dips in The Washington Post and the Government Employees Insurance Company, respectively, and the final harvest was huge.

Buffett's keen investment sense makes Berkshire's investment moves this year seem to have reasons, and whether the ""stock god"" can outperform the market again this time will be the focus of many investors.",finance,1651531946

personalfinance,Buying into I-Bonds via Savings for Student Loan Payment,"If the title sounds like a terrible idea, then I would love to hear it, but please hear me out first.

I've been staying away from the I-bond fad because I have student loans. I have been saving up for a lump sum payment, and because the 1-year holding period has always exceeded the restart deadline, it has seemed risky to lock up money intended to pay down debt. However, it occurs to me that now it is a near-safe bet to put the money I have been saving for that payment in I-bonds. (A couple weeks ago would have been even better.) Here is how I am gaming it out, with say 10k to put toward the bonds:

In the worst-case scenario, I get 6 months at 9.62%, then 0%, for an overall profit of $481 (maybe a little more if the interest compounds—I don't know). The student loan interest resumes in full with no forgiveness September 1st. I make the bare minimum effort of cashing out the I-bonds at the 1-year mark, 8–9 months later, to pay off the extra loans. The student loan interest rates are all ≤6%, so this costs me no more than $450 in extra interest.

Thus I come out ahead, though it's comparable to HYSA interest. Most likely, however, the second 6 months will have a positive interest rate (though the last 3 will vanish if I cash out the bonds). It is also possible for there to be action on the loans themselves. In either case, my situation improves (on top of any savings from student loan action). This overcomes what I could get from my HYSA.

Moreover, a significant benefit with the plan is that, at the end of the holding period, I can actually pay the student loans out of the cash savings that make up my emergency fund, and then treat the I-bonds as part of my emergency fund. The effect, compared to the ""bare minimum"" plan above, is having moreover transferred $10k of my e-fund into I-bonds without suffering the holding period. This lets me avoid the liquidity issue that normally inhibits such a transfer. Of course, I would take care that enough of my e-fund is in my HYSA so that a small emergency (one month's expenses or less) would not cause me to churn through I-bonds.

The main risk I see here involves tying up some funds (the $10k saved toward loan payments now stuck in I-bonds) that are otherwise a secondary if-need-be emergency fund. This seems minor. Another risk comes from putting part of my e-fund in I-bonds—withdrawing can be slower, so I need to be ready for that. But as long as my e-fund is healthy (and it is) and has a healthy cash/HYSA portion (as I plan), the risks should be acceptable. Maybe there are other factors to consider, however.

Any thoughts on the matter? I haven't accounted for taxes, but I don't expect that to be significant compared to the benefit of likely &gt;0% interest rates and the ability to safeguard my e-fund against inflation in the long-term. Is there anything else I'm missing?",finance,1651539859

Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 11 upward revisions and 0 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 10 upward revisions and 0 downward.
While rivals struggled with a tight chip supply market, AMD used that dynamic to grow its margins.

Financial Outlook (Non-GAAP) provided by the company in its Q4 earnings call:
AMD's stronger-than-expected showing was driven by the robust demand for its processors, which are used in a variety of facilities and devices ranging from data centers to computers to gaming consoles.

Given AMD's move to the N5 TSMC node, when the next-generation EPYC server CPU Genoa hits the market in Q4, Raymond James' Chris Caso believes the technology gap between the two companies will widen further.

AMD is also investing in long-term growth with some acquisitions - Pensando (April) and Xilinx (February); the companies are not directed at enhancing AMD's retail offerings; they are aimed at large corporations as AMD looks to push into higher-margin markets.
In last week of April, Raymond James upgraded AMD to Strong Buy from outperform, citing several reasons, including an attractive valuation; it also adds several secular growth areas, a more muted cyclical exposure than other semiconductor stocks.

Peer company Intel forecasted Q2 guidance which suggested a slowdown in the PC market.

YTD, the stock lost 42% amid the tech sell-off driven by rising interest rates and thus presents a buying opportunity investors as investors are attracted by expected growth in Q1 earnings.",finance,1651549222
personalfinance,Should I use a personal loan to pay off more than 16K in credit card debt if my interest is going to be more if I acquire the loan?,"Hi redditers,

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first reddit post and I know everyone here has so much knowledge about topics (especially finance). Here is my dilemma: 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to dental and tuition costs over the years, I have maxed out 2 credit cards. One at 9000 and the other at 7553. These are the only two credit cards besides a 500 dollar credit card I got last month in hopes to improve my credit, a discount tires card (paid off) and a furniture store card (23 a month payment with no interest and about 200 bucks from being fully paid off). 

I am able to make the monthly minimum on the two cards and pay about 521 a month on them. The 9000 credit card is at a 23.99% variable APR and the 7553 card is at a 20.24 purchase APR. I have noticed the interests have gone up a decent amount.

I am considering taking out a personal loan, but the only option I could afford is a 495 monthly payment with 26.50% interest rate and 29.69% fixed APR. It seems great to pay off my credit cards and just focus on the loan which would be paid off in 5 years even with all the interest. I have heard other people say that it is a bad idea and it is better to just keep doing the monthly payments. I just really want these cards paid off so I can have an emergency lifeline (not for shopping or anything like that). I am considering also applying to Discover or Citi Bank for a 0% APR card but am afraid I will not get approved for a lot and potentially get denied. My credit score currently is a 658.

CryptoCurrency,"In the next few days, the world expects the federal reserve to announce a hike in interest rates of 0.25-0.50%. People expect this will cause a big dip in BTC price, and increase BTC dominance in the market. Risk-on vs. Risk-off investment thesis explained.","Title.               

**TL;DR - BTC could see a massive drop the next few days. If it does, I'm ready to buy in, and I wouldn't be surprised to see many new players entering the space as well.**                 

I'm not a magician, I don't have a magic wand, I'm not a prophet, but what happens is in times like these the market goes from risk-open to risk-averse. Let's stop and imagine what that means from a practical perspective. I only learned what ""risk-on"" vs. ""risk-off"" means these past few months and it seems to work like this...               

**What does Risk-on mean?**                 
When you are ""risk-on"", it sounds like a gambling term if you step back and take a look at the situation. What does that mean? It means you have lots of dollars to play with, the economic times encourage speculative spending (like immediately after a round of quantitative easing) with things like new-ish stocks of companies that are trying to do something revolutionary but might only be a brand new company to a space where others dominate. **It might seem like common sense now, but if you were a low-level millionaire investor in 2009 (let's say you had 3 million USD of cash and a grand total of 10 million USD of assets) and you were invited by Elon Musk to attend a pre-IPO meeting to invest in his company, which at the time only had the Tesla Roadster, which could be driven for 1 hour before running out of electricity, you might be willing to RISK an investment of a few hundred thousand USD for some early-round stock in his company since it's, comparatively speaking, only a few small percentage points of your overall net-worth. Make sense now? good.**                 

**What does Risk-off mean?**                
Risk-off is just what it sounds like. You don't want to take risk and gamble with your money or investments, so you find a time to multiply the number of dollars that you have or are worth in a time when there is no excess of money being printed. Simultaneously, the value of the USD  may also be increasing (which is happening now as I type this), which incentivizes you to accumulate more dollars. What's the only way to do this from a traditional investors' perspective? High-yield savings accounts and government bonds. Right now if you google search 5 year treasury yield or 30 year treasury yield, you'll see that the amount of profit you can generate from those is reaching the same levels it was at in 2018 - before the pandemic hit.             

**The inbound Federal Reserve announcement:**                 
No one has a crystal ball and no one can tell you what the results of what the Fed will say in a couple of days. There's just a strong consensus among all investment experts that there will be an announcement that will strengthen the USD, and thus breed a Risk-off environment for the short term (let's say the next few months, maybe even the rest of 2022, I have no clue how long that will last). I think everyone is looking at the Federal Reserve and just thinking, ""We already know what you're gonna say, so just say it so that it's on the record and we see the market make the appropriate decisions.""              

**The dip people are expecting:**                
Again I am not a financial advisor. I can't tell you want to do with your money and I hope you're making smart decisions with your money. I cannot tell you how low bitcoin will go. I can only tell you that this will also affect bitcoin dominance. Make sure you have dry powder. And don't do anything risky.                 

Hope you guys learned something new today.                

EDIT: I feel like an idiot. Lots of people here are saying that this is already ""priced in"" as per previous comments by Jerome Powell. I feel like my thesis just barely holds any weight because, as I said above, we are waiting for the ""We already know what you're gonna say, so just say it..."" as a formality. I feel like there might be some contrarian investors that are betting / investing a small amount in the opposite direction, because if there is a 1% chance that they are right, then they are going to make bank.",cryptocurrency,1651553065

personalfinance,Should I use GMC Employee discount?,"First off I'm in Canada, so I'm using Canadian dollars and KM :)

I'm trying to purchase a vehicle in 2022 and I don't know what my most finically responsible option is.

I'm trying to decide between buying a new or used truck. I'm looking to buy a vehicle, ideally a 4x4 Truck. The used market for trucks right now is out of control, so I don't know if it makes sense to try and buy used. This is my first time buying a truck so I don't know what's meant to be a fair price on the used market. I also have access to a employee discount if a buy a new GM vehicle

I'm looking to put down between $10-15k on a truck and I'm ok with up to a $500 per month payment. Here are my current options:

1. I'm lucky enough to have access to a GM family discount of roughly 12% off. I could buy a 2022 Chevy Colorado for about $42K. This results in roughly $400 / month payment for 84 months at 1% with $10k down.
2. I buy a 2015 Colorado for roughly $30k CAD with 75k km on the clock. This results in $338.14 / month payment for 84 months at 5-6% with $10k down
3. Or I could keep looking and find a early 2000s (2003-2006) Toyota Tacoma with 200k on the clock for roughly $15k. I could pay this cash.

I really don't know what the best option would be and how to make my money go the furthest.

Let me know what you think! Thanks

**TLDR:** I've narrowed it down to 3 options.

1. purchase a new truck (with 12% employee discount and a 1% interest rate)
2. Purchase a used vehicle with 70k km mileage for roughly 30k (5-6% interest rate)
3. Purchase a old Toyota with &lt;200k km mileage ($15k cash)",finance,1651555877

Basically we have a situation where Shadow IT has cropped up and become a thing for a variety of reasons that aren't good and don't make sense, and we've been asked to provide a procedure document for other departments to use when choosing and vetting third party software, specifically cloud services, that may or may not house PII or other sensitive data (like internal network system information from specialized devices and the networks they operate on).

I would like to slant it a bit so that these other departments are like ""omg, IT, you just do it for us"" and be done with it.

We have requirements due to data we acquire and use, to strictly follow NIST 800-53 specifically, and the ask by the agency that provides this data is to either only choose cloud vendors that are FedRamp authorized, or find some reasonably reliable way to verify their NIST 800-53 control compliance.

economy,Why are we raising interest rates to combat inflation?,"In Australia they are raising interest rates to combat inflation. The value of items is driven by supply and demand. Obviously things like world events and climate change will impact supply, but price changes due to these sorts of things is just resetting the price to the new real value, and wouldn’t lead to runaway inflation - the law of supply and demand will just find the new equilibrium. And if peoples wages are not increasing (which they havnt been in Australia) then demand due to increased wealth to the overall population can’t be a factor. I can only assume it’s the very wealthy people whose wealth is increasing from investments and a booming housing market that are driving demand growth. But raising interest rates is a broad brush which will hurt the blue collar workforce who have not seen any in growth in wealth for a decade. So the upper middle class will be the only beneficiaries of this economic lever by keeping prices low for them by reducing demand from the masses who are already stretching their budget thin. Wouldn’t a better lever to quell inflation in an economy that has seen zero wage growth be to increase income tax on higher earning individuals who have seen significant income growth? I don’t understand how we can even have demand driven inflation if incomes remain constant. And I don’t see why inflation should be seen as something being broken in the economy if increases are due to supply (other than needing government to build greater supply through incentives and investment). And for that matter, why should wage growth be a target that we strive for, doesn’t it just become and positive feedback loop where wage growth and inflation both continue to feed each other?",finance,1651568332

# [Stock futures are flat after big market reversal to start May](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/02/stock-futures-are-lower-after-big-market-reversal-to-start-may.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed on Tuesday morning after the major averages staged a big reversal to start the month.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded just 8 points lower points, or less than 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were each marginally higher.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the major averages posted a wild up-and-down session with the Nasdaq Composite rising 1.63% in a late-day comeback, despite falling as much as 1.07% earlier in the day. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57% after hitting a new 2022 low earlier in the session.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the Dow gained 84 points, or 0.26%. At its session lows, the Dow was down more than 400 points.
*****
&gt; Those moves come on the back of a brutal month in April for stocks. April was the worst month since March 2020 for the Dow and S&amp;P 500. It was the worst month for the Nasdaq since 2008.
*****
&gt; “We think the data continues to paint a picture of extreme fear and a contrarian opportunity for longer-term investors, even though there is scope for further movement/more downside in the very near term on some gauges,” RBC strategist Lori Calvasina said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield also climbed to a new milestone on Monday. The bond yield hit 3.01% during the session, its highest point since December 2018. However, it fell back on Tuesday, possibly easing selling pressure on stocks.
*****
&gt; Those moves come ahead of a widely anticipated Federal Reserve meeting.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is largely expecting interest rates the central bank to raise rates by 50 basis points this week, with some investors believe expectations of aggressive monetary tightening from the central bank are already priced into markets.
*****
&gt; The Federal Open Market Committee will issue a statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m.
*****
&gt; Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Tuesday that, with the Fed tightening and the economy slowing, capital preservation should be the main goal for investors.
*****
&gt; ″“You can’t think of a worse environment than where we are right now for financial assets. Clearly you don’t want to own bonds and stocks,” Jones said.
*****
&gt; The expected rate hike comes as there are growing concerns about the global economy, due in part to China’s lockdowns and the war in Europe.
*****
&gt; “Markets continue to be hostage to the China Covid-19 response and the geopolitics, which are overshadowing what is still a very resilient fundamental picture,” JPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; A number of consumer-oriented companies are still reporting earnings this week. Shares of Avis Budget jumped more than 6% during extended trading after the car company surpassed earnings expectations on the top and bottom lines.
*****
&gt; Shares of Clorox were under pressure after the home products company cut its full year gross margin outlook, citing inflation. DuPont’s stock fell more than 2% after its quarterly report showed operating margin shrinking year over year.
*****
&gt; Chegg’s stock price tumbled nearly 30% during extended trade after the textbook company issued weak guidance for the full year despite exceeding earnings expectations.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, shares of Restaurant Brands and Pfizer were little changed in premarket trading after beating expectations on the top and bottom lines Tuesday morning.
*****
&gt; Airbnb, AMD, Lyft and Starbucks are expected to report earnings after the bell Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Traders will also watch for the latest reading of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) data that is expected at 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday. Data on auto sales for April is also expected on Tuesday.

We are leasing a 2020 Toyota RAV4 XLE Hybrid (has about 14.5K miles on it). The lease reaches maturity on January 16th, 2023. The residual value is $21,700. Carmax would currently purchase the car for $36,800. I ordered a 2022 Hyundai Tucson Plug-In Hybrid Limited yesterday with the intention of trading in the RAV4 for that car. However, I want to make sure that's a good decision first. Options:

1) Purchase the car for $21,700 and finance that amount (terms and payment TBD).
2) Purchase the car for $21,700 and pay that in cash so we own it outright.
3) Wait for the Tucson to arrive (could be 6-9 months), and trade in the RAV4 at the dealer (likely not a good option since the dealer will inevitably kill us on the trade-in value).
4) Purchase the RAV4 for $21,700 in cash, wait for the Tucson to come in, sell the RAV4 to Carmax and then use those proceeds as a down payment on the Tucson (we'd purchase it, not lease it). This assumes that the RAV4 will still be worth anywhere close to what it is now by that time.

Other factors: 
1) We would receive $9,087 in tax credits between federal and state (Oregon).
2) Most of the driving we do is short trips around town, so we'd use very little gas with a plug-in hybrid.
3) I'm the kind of guy that really likes to get a new car every few years and the Hyundai definitely has some nice features compared to the RAV4. ;-)

Assuming all other non-salary/bonus is equivalent... How do I calculate the annual ""benefit"" of the cash balance pension.  At retirement, I can take a lump sum or an annuity with a few options.

Current value of the pension is $14k, after 3 years at the company(just vested).  It costs me nothing as an employee - all employer contributions, and guaranteed 5% interest rate on the invested balance. The employer calculator estimates it will be worth 780k lump sum in 25 years, or $3.2k- 4k/month depending on survivorship choices.

I'm maxing other retirement accounts and investing another portion in the market, and will continue to do so regardless of which position I am in.

How do I determine what that pension is worth in today's dollars, as a replacement for salary vs the other job.  For instance, I'd like to say ""that pension is worth X/yr increase in salary, but the new job is offering Y/yr over my current salary."" So all other options the same, X is greater or less than Y.

personalfinance,APY confusion with using compounding annuity calculators,"If I want to see what putting 100$ a month into a savings account would amount to after 10 years I would think I'd use a future value of annuity calculator like this:

[https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/future-value-annuity-calculator.php](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/future-value-annuity-calculator.php)

&amp;#x200B;

For an example of rates anyone can view online I'll consider just a regular savings at Wells Fargo:

[https://www.wellsfargo.com/savings-cds/rates/](https://www.wellsfargo.com/savings-cds/rates/)

The site states Interest Rate = 0.01% and APY = 0.01%, compounded daily.

&amp;#x200B;

So I set the calculator values like this:

Periods (t) = 10

Rate (R) = 0.01

Compounding (m) = 365

Pmt Amount (PMT) = 100

Growth (G) = 0

\# of payments (q) = 12

Payment at (T) = end

&amp;#x200B;

The result is FV = $12,005.95, so I'd make $5.95 in interest over 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. Am I doing something wrong? Does ""APY = 0.01%"" mean R = 1, not R = 0.01? 

2. For a local CU, I see money market savings account rates say APY = 0.15, DV = 0.15, so for this R = 0.15?

3. Are savings interest rates just terrible? In my class all the example problems would have rates like 5%-9%, and the default in online calculators is often set in that range.",finance,1651602841
stocks,'Wall Street sees greater risk of default by major banks',"May 3 (Reuters) - Reporting by Mehnaz Yasmin in Bengaluru; Editing by Alden Bentley and Anil D'Silva

The cost to insure bonds of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup (C.N) against default hit two-year highs on Monday on growing fears the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive moves to tame inflation might tip the economy into recession.
Credit risks have worsened since the Ukraine crisis as some big U.S. banks took a hit to their mainstay businesses, with capital market activity coming to a standstill and lending expected to remain lackluster.

That has prompted bondholders to consider hedging strategies to protect against potential defaults.

The war in Ukraine and Western sanctions could knock more than 1% off global growth this year and add two and a half percentage points to inflation, the OECD has said.
JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs and Citigroup combined put aside a $3.36 billion in credit loss reserves in the first quarter. That is a reversal from the past 12 months when lenders released billions in reserves after losses related to COVID-19 failed to materialize.

Spreads on five-year credit default swaps (CDS) on Goldman Sachs closed at $108.92 on Monday, Morgan Stanley at $104.96 and Citigroup at $107.94, their highest in at least two years.

CDS is a contractual agreement that lets buyers swap credit risk with sellers and thus insures bondholders against default.
Spreads on five-year CDS on JP Morgan , Wells Fargo and Bank of America Corp also look set to exceed near two-year highs set in March.

""Any short-term spike in CDS on U.S. banks is likely related to fears over a Russian default,"" said Thomas J. Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York.

The correlation co-efficient between Russia's five-year CDS RUGV5YUSAC=R on sovereign debt and the banks' CDS is between 0.5 and 0.6 in the five months ended May this year, suggesting a strong positive correlation.
A derivatives panel has ruled on Wednesday that Russia could be in default after it failed to make a payment due on April 4 in U.S. dollars on two sovereign bonds, bringing a payout on billions of dollars in default insurance a step closer.

stocks,10-year U.S. Treasury yield hits 3% for first time since late 2018,"On Monday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit 3% for the first time since late 2018, marking a new milestone.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose about 11 basis points to 2.994% and hit an intraday high of 3.01%. The 30-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped more than 9 basis points to 3.044%. The move on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note brought yields to their highest levels since Dec. 3, 2018. The benchmark yield has risen rapidly this year after ending 2021 near 1.5%. At the end of March, it was trading around 2.33%.

Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said: ""This is a very psychologically meaningful mark for the 10-year Treasury yield, but it's not really a significant resistance level for it. We have to go back to 2018. Year-to-date highs of 3.25%. Of course, we're seeing very positive or upward momentum behind Treasury yields, that hasn't changed.""

Current payoff quote is $14,200, current car value on KBB around $29k. I know it's a high interest rate, so I would prefer not to pay all of it for no good reason. My current creditkarma score is at 770. I've got 401ks, IRAs, HSAs, etc. maxed out and I'm lucky enough to have around 4 months of living expenses saved as an emergency cash. I'm due for a bonus this month which will be around $14k after taxes. I think I have three options here, but I'm not sure which one would work best:

1. Keep the loan. Use bonus money to bump up emergency cash savings to 6 months, put the rest into index funds (which are not performing well at all in the last half year :/)

2a. Refinance for approximately the same duration, hopefully a lower interest rate and save on interest over the duration of the loan.

2b. Refinance for lower interest rate, but longer duration, ending up with the same interest paid over the years. This would lower my monthly payment, so I could contribute more to index funds every month and maybe beat the interest paid.

3. Just pay it off, because of inflation and index funds are staying level, the future does not seem bright with the war and post-pandemic stuff still going on.

MachineLearning,"[D] Any tips for handling sparse, discrete, temporal data?","Hi, I'm wondering if anyone could help familiarize me with modern feature engineering methods for handling this type of data in the context of machine learning.

***Background***
---
The data I'm talking about is hospital/facility utilization data for patients. Below is a table that is similar to the data I have for each patient. In this example we can see that this single patient went to the ED on the 5th day, was admitted into the hospital on the 5th day, and was admitted to a SNF  (Skilled Nursing Facility -basically a nursing home) on the 8th day:

||ED|Hospital|SNF|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Day 1|0|0|0|
|Day 2|0|0|0|
|Day 3|0|0|0|
|Day 4|0|0|0|
|Day 5|1|1|0|
|Day 6|0|0|0|
|Day 7|0|0|0|
|Day 8|0|0|1|
|Day 9|0|0|0|


In reality, we have more types of facilities as columns and years worth of days. 

***Problem***
---
Obviously this data is very sparse and dimensionally cumbersome. I'm trying to develop methods to condense this data into a form better suited for prediction of various medical target variables: ranging from discharge type, expected length of stay, to death.

***Current Approaches***
---
Up until now, I've been doing something similar to what I've found in [this paper which tries to predict patient mortality within 60 days](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12911-020-01235-6.pdf):


&gt;Specifically, each patient’s history is segmented into four time slices with boundaries at 30, 90, and 180 days preceding admission, excluding all data collected more than a year prior. Each data category (e.g. ICD-10 diagnoses) is aggregated in each slice into:

&gt;􏰀 Count of each unique code,

&gt;􏰀 Count of unique codes and total code count across days

&gt;􏰀 Mean, variance, minimum, maximum, and range of the daily number of codes.

&gt;While a typical patient may have fewer than a dozen unique ICD-10 codes, all patients have aggregate values, e.g. total codes during slice and max number of daily
codes. With these features, a model may learn differ- ences in specific disease types as well as disease burden and utilization with these features.


They essentially looked at the patient's previous year of utilization, and binned features into 0-30, 30-90, 90-180, 180-365 windows and generated counts of each ICD-10 (which are basically binary codes for conditions/operations) codes for each window. They used ICD-10 codes but this is analogous to the columns in my above example. For instance, I have columns like ""number_of_ED_events_0_30"" which contains the number of ED events a patient has had within the last 30 days. 

This method seems pretty naive but it works to a degree. I'm hoping to learn about more powerful methods out there.

---

Another approach I've seen and have been working on is borrowed from spatio-temporal feature engineering methods. I came across a [paper that modeled occurrences of crime as ""self-exciting"" point processes](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~frederic/papers/crime1.pdf). ""self-exciting"" as in, when crime occurs, it tends to be followed by more crime within a short time-frame. I was attracted to this idea because hospital utilization tends to follow a similar trend. Hospital events for patients tend to be clustered and self-exciting. So what I've been doing is working on modeling patient utilization as a [Hawkes process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_process#Hawkes_(self-exciting\)_processes). The idea being to draw features from the model as opposed to the highly sparse and dimensional data itself. I'm working through this now but I have my doubts of how well this will turn out -so I'm trying to keep an open ear for other methods.

***Question***

This was revealed to ForkLog by the businessman. Cryptocurrency scams have become popular particular with cryptos like Monero, Bitcoin and Ethereum. These coin power a lot of blockchain projects including Sandbox, Decentraland, Hydrominer, Cycled and Nature's Vault. 

The appeal's authors demanded that they be paid Monero in the equivalent of $500 per month, referring to their offer as a ""discount.""

Don't you want to be mined on your behalf all around Russia? Then you can take advantage of the special deal, which allows you to purchase immunity for only $500 every month. Payments will be made in Monero on the first of each month, according to the letter. 
The attackers also mentioned 

Alexander Lebedev, Mendeleev's partner in the Indefieco DeFi project, who is linked to the loss of bitcoins from entrepreneur Konstantin Malofeev's WEX exchange, according to some sources.

The extortionists threatened to resume «mining» numerous infrastructure facilities in the Russian Federation if the Russian Federation refused to cooperate. Mendeleev's mail received roughly a dozen responses from city administrations' mail robots regarding receiving letters on his behalf on this day. 
The crypto businessman claimed in a message to ForkLog that the letter's authors were most likely unrelated to the WEX issue. 

«I'm a hundred percent sure I'm right.» I'm confident the person isn't writing from Russia; otherwise, he'd know that nothing works here until May 4, and all of his letters would end up in the pussy in the tray», he added.

Remember that at the end of January 2022, the name Mendeleev was used in the dissemination of a series of bogus mining reports in several Russian Federation districts. The attackers included the businessman's genuine address and phone information in the written appeals. 

Then Mendeleev made a link between the incident and his current investigation. He specifically referenced the information released in ForkLog about the movement of bitcoins from a ""miner"" who names himself a WEX client's wallet to the Binance exchange.",cryptocurrency,1651665257

&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced by 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Markets are preparing for a hawkish Fed, and the central bank is also expected to announce a plan to cut its roughly $9 trillion balance sheet by $95 billion a month, beginning in June.
*****
&gt; Respondents to the May CNBC Fed Survey indicated they expect the central bank to announce the long-anticipated 50 basis point hike on Wednesday, followed by a second one in June as it looks to cut its balance sheet. The majority of respondents also expect a recession at the end of the tightening cycle, the survey found.
*****
&gt; “High inflation constrains the Fed, making easing monetary policy less likely if growth (or markets) fall. We have long argued that elevated inflation would put the Fed in a bind – when growth weakens they would not be willing to or able to ride to the rescue by loosening monetary policy,” Citi quantitative strategist Alexander Saunders said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; This year, stocks have fallen sharply and Treasury yields have spiked, but it is not clear if the market has fully accounted for an aggressive Fed.
*****
&gt; “We’re at a place right now where the market’s pricing in that inflation is going to be back near pre-pandemic levels within two years with only modest Fed tightening,” said Rebecca Patterson, Bridgewater’s chief investment strategist, on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday. “We think that either the Fed is going to have to tighten more than expected to get inflation to their target or inflation is going to be higher than expected.”

&gt; “If our ‘no recessions soon’ call is right, then the pattern we have seen so far this year will probably continue: with equities punching lower and then recovering at least partially as long as recession fails to materialize, and the rates and commodity curves continuing to move higher over time,” wrote Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs’ chief economist on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is currently trading in correction territory, down about 12.4% year to date. LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick pointed out Tuesday the current correction parallels the size and length of previous corrections after World War II.

stocks,Nearly risk-free I bonds to deliver a record 9.62% interest for the next six months,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/05/02/i-bonds-to-deliver-a-record-9point62percent-interest-for-the-next-six-months.html

If you're eyeing ways to fight swelling prices, I bonds, an inflation-protected and nearly risk-free asset, may now be even more appealing.

I bonds are paying a 9.62% annual rate through October 2022, the highest yield since being introduced in 1998, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced Monday.

The hike is based on the March consumer price index data, with annual inflation growing by 8.5%, the U.S. Department of Labor reported.

""It's a milestone for I bonds,"" said Ken Tumin, founder and editor of DepositAccounts.com, who tracks these assets closely.

I bonds, backed by the U.S. government, don't lose value and earn monthly interest based on two parts, a fixed rate and a variable rate, changing every six months.

While the variable rate is 9.62% through October 2022, the fixed rate remains at 0%, according to the Treasury.

The fixed rate stays the same for the 30-year life of the bond, meaning someone who purchased I bonds with a higher fixed rate may beat inflation for at least six months, Tumin said.

Although the fixed rate has been 0% since May 2020, it peaked at 3.6% for six months starting in May 2000. You can see a history of both rates here.

How to buy I bonds

There are only two ways to purchase these assets: online through TreasuryDirect, limited to $10,000 per calendar year for individuals or using your federal tax refund to buy an extra $5,000 in paper I bonds. There are redemption details for each one here.

You may also buy more I bonds through businesses, trusts or estates. For example, a married couple with separate businesses may each purchase $10,000 per company, plus $10,000 each as individuals, totaling $40,000.

Drawbacks of I bonds

One of the downsides of I bonds is you can't redeem them for at least one year, said certified financial planner George Gagliardi, founder of Coromandel Wealth Management in Lexington, Massachusetts. And if you cash them in within five years, you'll lose the previous three months of interest directly before your sale.

""I think it's decent, but just like anything else, nothing is free,"" he said. 

Another possible drawback is lower future returns. The variable portion of I bond rates may adjust downward every six months, and you may prefer higher-paying assets elsewhere, Gagliardi said. But there's only a one-year commitment with a three-month interest penalty if you decide to cash out early.

Still, I bonds may be worth considering for assets beyond your emergency fund, said Christopher Flis, a CFP and founder of Resilient Asset Management in Memphis, Tennessee.

""I think that the I bond is a wonderful place for people to put the money they don't need right now,"" he said, such as an alternative to a one-year certificate of deposit.

As of May 2, the average savings account yield is under 1%, and most one-year CDs are paying less than 1.5%, according to DepositAccounts.

""But I bonds aren't a replacement for long-term funds,"" Flis added.",finance,1651669257

personalfinance,Consolidated my debt - Looking for next steps - Here is my plan,"I was in some pretty serious debt and I make good money ($90k+), but I support a family of 3 and live in a HCOL.

I was paying $2200/month in rent and I had a total of $35k in debt (CC, Personal and Medical, Sallie Mae) with interest rates averaging 32%. I was making minimum payments on all my debt at about $1450/month.  None of this includes my car or federal student loans since I can expect to pay those arent bad debt and had low interest rates.

Needless to say, I was spending way more than I made, not saving, and not contributing to my 401k.

Last week, I reached out to my aunt and she loaned me $28,400 at a 5% interest rate for 5 years. So now my payments dropped from $1450/month to $650/month - $535 for the $28k loan and $115 for my Sallie Mae loan. My family and I are also moving in with my parents for the summer to save rent money and then finding another apartment in August that is much much cheaper.

At this moment, I've upped my 401k to 6% contribution with my company matching 50%. I also switched to having $1800/bi-weekly put into my account for all expenses and the rest goes towards savings ($164/bi weekly - More may go to savings if I work overtime).

My plan is to save $1500 in savings, then I am going to triple my payment on my Sallie Mae loan which has $6,641 at a 10.15% (Variable interest).  Once that is paid off I am going to up my payment on my consolidated debt loan ($28K).  After that I plan on tackling my emergency fund and saving for a home.

My wife plans on graduating by the end of 2023 and then she will be working full-time.  Not sure what kind of salary she will have but honestly, anything she gets paid will be a major boost to our income.

Any other ideas on how I can decrease debt and build wealth?

Thank you!",finance,1651671364
personalfinance,Leave federal gov't job to go back to private sector? Long term benefits like pension vs making more privately and loading up a 401k?,"This is a throwaway account, as this all relates to my current job and don't feel comfortable with it being on my main account.

I started working with a well known government entity back at the start of year. I'm 24 and a software engineer. So far it's be fine. Just ""fine."" Was in the private sector before out of college, for about 2.5 years. Everything about the job is better than my last, aside from the caveats that come with working for the government (no WFH, clearance maintenances, etc). Lately I've been thinking of leaving. Some days it just feels like this jobs isn't for me and I can do the exact same work back in the private sector, making way more. Right now, I'm on a modified pay scale for STEM employees, making about $95.5k in the DC area. I also receive a benefit of about $10k a year paid bi-weekly with my paycheck to use towards student loans, federal and privately owned ones. This, along with my signing bonus and paid moving expenses, all come with a signed service agreement of at least 1 year (the student loan stuff is a 3 year agreement that doesn't start until next year; so it doesn't end until 2026), that I have to pay back should I voluntarily leave before they end. 

But this isn't r/cscareerquestions, I'm just trying to focus on the long term financial implications of leaving this job. 

I earn a pension, which, I hope, will be quite nice when I retire in 25-30 years from here. It also will come with the standard federal benefit of retaining health insurance for life instead of relying on medicare and waiting until 65. My TSP (a federally backed 401(k) essentially), is matched up to 5% with me putting in 6%, for a total of 11% roth per paycheck. 

But, like I've said, I've been thinking of leaving for a few different reasons. But by leaving I not only give up on those retirement benefits, I have the short term hassle of paying back a bunch of money if I don't stay until at least my one year mark (plan is to make it to that date and then consider leaving again). I figured that by going back to privately, I could easily earn an extra $30-40k again (using some friends' salaries as base lines). This fixes that 10k extra I'm given for loans, but I lose the pension which was a big reason I wanted to try and work here in the first place. I thought about taking more of that extra income and throwing it into a new 401(k) to offset the lack of pension. But it isn't a pension lol.  

I'm hoping people might be able to show some better insight into what these different paths might look like once I near retirement age so I can continue trying to make a sound decision. Suck it up and try to be here the rest of my career. Or go back to private and load extra money into a 401(k).",finance,1651672392

CryptoCurrency,Will DeFi Summer experience a revival? Some thoughts on potential use-cases.,"Since 2019, decentralized finance (DeFi) proved a valuable utility for cryptocurrency and likely kickstarted the bull market. Yield farming, staking and lending earned many cryptocurrency investors annual interest rates in double- and even triple-digit territory. Unheard of in traditional finance!

But with high returns, investors faced high risks too. Numerous exploits of smart contracts where user funds were drained and malicious activity of DeFi protocols that suddenly withdrew large amounts of cryptocurrency resulted in a healthy amount of skepticism. Also, DeFi moved to the backstage since speculation around NFTs became a lucrative investment alternative, enabling investors to achieve immense multipliers.

But whilst the focus of crypto enthusiasts has shifted towards NFTs, DeFi has developed into a broader ‘Web3’ movement. Providers like Bancor continuously developed their protocols to provide a safer environment for stakeholders. Others, like Ocean Protocol, improved and used DeFi infrastructure to disrupt multi-trillion-dollar industries that have not even been explored by investors yet. Bottom line, the foundation is set and DeFi may just be on the verge of taking the center stage again to push the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization to new all-time highs.

## An unexplored DeFi utility: data

Data is the world’s most valuable resource. Our future depends on technologies like artificial intelligence, which can only function successfully when large amounts of data are available. But right now, less than 0.5% of the world’s data is accessible. Like traditional resources, data is exploited by large corporations creating an unfair, monopolistic market power. Ever wondered why Google’s analytics are the best in the world? They’ve got the most data. The data economy is a trillion-dollar opportunity yet to be explored.

Data Marketplaces, like Ocean Protocol which were recently awarded the [Technology Pioneer by the World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ocean-protocol-4282e36813) are looking disrupt the traditional data economy.

Now, data owners can tokenize their dataset into an NFT, which proves the exclusive right to the data. It’s similar to owning a Bored Ape, but instead of a JPEG file, Data NFT owners own the right to a dataset. Data NFT owners can also create a supply of Datatokens, which are built on the ERC20 standard. Datatokens allow for any DeFi activity to take place, all while the assets are backed by real-world data. A breakthrough!

On Web 3 Data Marketplaces, data investors can stake on Datatoken liquidity pools or can simply bet on the value of a dataset increasing by swapping. If someone is interested to access the dataset itself, data buyers can purchase access to the data. This proves a valuable utility, because Data NFT owners can actively generate revenues by selling Datatokens to data buyers. All regulated by blockchain technology on Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain or Polkadot’s Moonriver.

## DataFi Infrastructure

There is a growing community surrounding the Ocean Protocol ecosystem and those that understood the magnitude of Data Finance have not left. Ocean Protocol’s DAO funds third-party teams to build valuable infrastructure that accelerates adoption of data as a valuable DeFi utility. [DataX](https://datax.fi/) for example is building Datapolis, a data finance protocol offering a ‘Data DEX’ that is building towards data-backed lending and much more. Another project is the [ALGA mobile Datatoken wallet](https://datatoken.app/), where users can track their data assets.",cryptocurrency,1651675149

investing,The Aerospace and Defense industry is undervalued,"YTD, Ishares US Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF is ""up"" .19% (so basically 0), but in comparison with the rest of the market tanking -13%, this is a great position to be in. This lack of a crash in comparison to the rest of the market (while there is never a guarantee of anything), serves as an example of an industry that (so far) isn't being influenced by bearish sentiments and rake hikes.

ITA also has yet to return to it's ATHs prior to the March 2020 crash, meaning that it did not experience the hyper bubble and burst of the fed printing money from 2020-2022. For me personally, I believe this means that either 1. should a full on market crash occur, ITA is currently priced at the same equivalent level as to where the rest of the market *SHOULD* be valued at, meaning a crash wont see it suffer significant prices drops, or 2. Price inflation that other assets have experienced have yet to make its way into the industry.

The companies within ITA are solid and aren't going anywhere. The weakest link currently is Boeing, which has suffered an unfortunate Earnings reports in the last 3 quarters, which is why I believe the ITA is lower than the ETF would otherwise be valued at. While these companies are not overwhelmingly raking in the dough in comparison to hardware and software companies such as AMD and MSFT.

More broadly speculating - The United States isn't shrinking its Defense spending anytime soon, and with the world beginning to transition back to multipolar world, and some trends of globalization reversing, the potential of armed conflict and the rate of armed conflict could likely increase. R&amp;D industry serves both as a bullish pro-American industry to invest in, while simultaneously acting as a hedge against current market make ups in the event global conflict occurs. It also offers exposure to space exploration innovation should that become a reality in the future.

**TL;DR:**

\- Solid Companies lead the A&amp;D industry

\- A&amp;D has yet to recover from 2020 ATH, never inflated during the 2021 bubble, and never dropped during the 2022 crash, suggesting it may trend upwards during an otherwise sidewise market.

\- Global world order is shifting away inch by inch from interconnected market capitalism, which will increase the odds of conflict.

\- US is still a leader in A&amp;D, and has no plans of decreasing its budget as western nations become more reliant on the US for defense

\- for more speculative reasons, A&amp;D also offers exposure to potential expansions of space exploration should that become a reality in our lifetime.",finance,1651675992

CryptoCurrency,The strategy behind Crypto.com's cut of benefits,"An explanation behind their ""clever"" strategy by cutting interest rates:

On board there are 3 types of customers:

1. Veterans, who bought Cro at 0.07-0.15 cents or are in the MCO era. They make up a very small percentage of the customer base, but they have a very high stake in the ecosystem and are still in profits even after the drop. We compare every customer as Icy/Rose holders. Because they bought cheap and staked very early, they have around **550.000 CRO!** in staking. With an APY of 12% they get **66.000 CRO** a year *(6000 for Jade)*and because they staked a long time ago they have the ability to unstake their CROs anytime
2. People, who have staked during the peak, because the bullrun upgraded their Tier without spending additional money. They have around **45.000 CRO** as Icy holders in staking which makes them around **5400 CRO** per year. Now you can see the difference between those two customer-groups. They make up a few percentage of the customers
3. Newcomers/""Boomers"" who are very new or aren't interested in Earn or CDC s high tier cards. They just want to buy some crypto in the app, accept the high fee in the app and that's it. Mostly ruby card Holders and they make up a HUGE percentage in the customer base. They are CDCs target, because they are easy to satisfy and low to maintain

So how do you cut costs without hurting your business?

1. Get rid of the small group of early investors who have over **550.000 CRO** in their cards. They make up most of the costs and they can unstake **anytime** they can. So you pretend to cut all benefits to create panic, so early investors are unstaking and dumping their bags
2. You got rid of a few early investors, who are the main cost. Those who staked during the bullrun still can't unlock their CRO
3. Once you got rid of veterans you reverse the cuts, but keep them low enough to keep the rest in your ecosystem to reduce extreme backlash and exodus from ""Bullrun Investors"" and image-damages 
4. Those who invested during the bullrun have about half of value before staking. Jade/Indigo holders have about 2000$ at stake. With 4% APY and Spotify, Neflix and cashback people will think twice if they want to unstake to lose all benefits or just ride further hoping the price will rise again, in the meanwhile keeping benefits. 
5. New customers don't care if benefits are slashed because they aren't affected, bcs they simply just don't use those benefits

|Customers|Causing costs for company|Population|Profits for company|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Vererans/Old**|Very High|Very Low|Low|
|**Middle**|Normal|Low|High |
|**(future)Newcomers**|Very Low|Very High|Very High|

Now you can see why they want to get rid of early investors 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR: their main goal is getting rid of old and loyal customers to reduce the costs without damaging their company, because they are the ones who benefit the most**",cryptocurrency,1651676414

Bitcoin,Michael Saylor: Bitcoin and the current situation around it.,"On the [MicroStrategy earnings](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/microstrategy-mstr-q1-2022-earnings-call-transcrip/) Michael Saylor shares his opinions on the current macro situation and events around bitcoin. Is worth a read. Emphasis mine

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In Q1, we saw some fairly seminal events, the trucker crisis in Canada, the Ukrainian war, Russian sanctions, continued inflation, supply chain chaos, concerns about food and energy shortages, all of those things have been combined with a weakening currency environment, the Chinese currency, the Japanese currency, South Africa -- South America and African currencies, and a lot of Asian currencies were all collapsing against the dollar. In fact, **just about every currency in the world, except for two, I think, are collapsing against the dollar right now.**  This is creating a very challenging macroeconomic environment.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's going to continue to create uncertainty and challenges for all businesses. I think that it has had the impact of increasing awareness of and the understanding of the need for a digital asset like Bitcoin and so the silver-lining is that hundreds of millions, if not billions of people are now becoming aware of the need for non-sovereign store value digital asset like Bitcoin. The negative is it creates a very challenging operating environment. Over the last few months in the world of Bitcoin, the interesting developments worth highlighting are the executive order coming out of the Biden White House on March 9th, which was really a first as long as anyone can remember, the **first time that we had the executive branch in the United States in essence highlighting and endorsing an asset class as being critical to the future of the nation**.  
&gt;  
&gt;And so I thought that, that was extraordinarily auspicious. Janet Yellen gave a speech on April 7th at American University, equally auspicious. We had the secretary of the treasury of the United States, laying out the case for decentralized networks, the theory of digital property, talking about the need for digital currencies. What the innovations in the crypto economy and suggesting that the administration is going to do enthusiastically move forward to provide responsible regulations to allow this economy to grow.  
&gt;  
&gt;I thought that was very critical, too. I think if you put all of these macroeconomic developments together with the regulator signal, what you have is a world that's a bit insecure about currencies and insecure about property rights and then, secure about 20th century banking systems and 20th century payment systems and aware that they need to find a solution. But you also have another big development, which is that the deniers of Bitcoin and digital assets in general are now being silenced by the administration of the United States. One of the early crippling criticism was this is just a panty scheme, where this is intangible or there's nothing here.  
&gt;  
&gt;And I think that, with now the head of the SEC, the head of treasury, the president of the United States acknowledging that there is something here. And it's an important priority for the entire government. I think that, that really isolates the deniers and if not making them look silly at this point, because, it's pretty clear that 250 million people know that there is something here. And it's growing like wildfire.  
&gt;  
&gt;And it's pretty clear that the government recognizes this. So, we have another classification of Bitcoin investors after deniers that will be the skeptics. The skeptics acknowledge that it exists. They acknowledge that it's good.  
&gt;  
&gt;**They may even acknowledge that, it's better than gold and it's better than other sorts of money or property and then they follow-up with the observation that since it's so good the politicians will ban it or the government will ban it**. And that was -- that's been articulated by a number of fairly well-known credible sources over the past two years. But of course, with the March 9th executive order and the Yellen speech of April 7th, it gets increasingly difficult to maintain the skeptical stance, because you would have to, in essence, put yourself in opposition to the White House, right? It's not the policy of the United States demand Bitcoin. So in fact, it's not the policy of anyone in the Western world to band Bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;So the deniers and the skeptics are being silenced, and now the entire Bitcoin market is evolving to be controlled by the traders, the technocrats, and the maximalist. And clearly, **the volatility of the market right now is driven by the fact that the traders are trading Bitcoin as a correlated asset to the NASDAQ. And technology investors that are NASDAQ heavy are selling or shorting technology assets as a risk off trade, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.** So I would say that, if we look at the last three months, although the macroeconomic environment is difficult and macroeconomic winds are blowing in the face of all risk assets and all operating companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would say the fundamental developments, the political developments and the market awareness of Bitcoin has made enormous strides – and **if you compare where we were today on where we are today versus two years ago, the asset class has matured dramatically, awareness has matured dramatically and the risk of holding the asset class has decreased.** And specifically, I think the skeptics in the past 24 months are increasingly disappearing and everyone is migrating to either a trader or a technocrat or a maximalist. **I had a chance to attend the Bitcoin conference in Miami Beach this April. I noted a massive surge of interest in bitcoin among politicians, among media and among investors.**  
&gt;  
&gt;And there are a lot of politicians that hadn't heard of it and weren't interested in it a year ago, both international and domestic, and now it's on their radar, and they realize they need to pay attention to it. It's probably not uncorrelated to the executive order of March 9. I think there's a lot more media coverage and we've seen a change in the media tone. I think the media tone two years ago was nonexistent.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, people used to lament that Bitcoin was not being covered by mainstream media at all. **It wasn't until February of 2021 after Tesla bought Bitcoin that Bitcoin got on to the radar of mainstream media. But I think that over the past few months, the tone has evolved from skeptical or amused to respectful.** And in fact, I almost noticed now that that mainstream journalists across the major papers and the major cable news networks are all much, much more aware of the entire crypto economy, much, much more aware of bitcoin in its value proposition and much less skeptical, much more interested in engage.  
&gt;  
&gt;And I think the environment has moved from disinterested, through skeptical to now neutrally intrigued or even, I would say, intrigued, intrigued would be the right word in the media. Also seen a bunch of investors, credible investors that are well respected in the space, speaking much more freely about Bitcoin in the marketplace.  And actually, becoming much more vocal and much more supportive in their words. And I think that, that's a big move forward over the past 12 months. Examples of that, we see our Carlos, Salinas, Piaggio becoming much more vocal, \[Inaudible\] becoming much more vocal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paul Tudor Jones becoming much more vocal. And Orlando Bravo becoming much more vocal. So, I think you'll continue to see this develop over the next 12 months. I think advances in the Lightning Network are pretty relevant, maybe one of the bigger developments in the past 12 months is lightening is maturing.  
&gt;  
&gt;And Lightning is the open permissionless non-custodial Layer 2 network. In essence, if Bitcoin represents protocol for sound money, Lightning represents a protocol for transaction and money transfer that's open permissionless. And since it's -- it could, in theory, scale to hundreds of millions or billions of transactions an hour. This is, in essence, the Internet of money.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Two years ago, the Lightning network was really just developmental. In the past year, it's come to life.** And so we're now entering into early part of the year two of the Internet for money coming to life. Major milestones there, block integrating, lightning into the Cash App was a major milestone.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The release of specifications for the Taro protocol on top of Lightning is a major milestone.** What it means is that Lightning will in time not just move Satoshi's back and forth at the speed of light to billions of people, **Lightning will also move other digital assets like stable coins**, Tether or a circle or any other digital currency or any other digital token could **or an NFC** or another asset could move over the Lightning network at extraordinary high speeds, extremely scalable, while taking advantage of the security assurances of the Bitcoin network. So that's pretty compelling. Kraken also incorporated Lightning into their exchange, and that's a very compelling breakthrough.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I think in time, all the competitive digital assets, exchanges and all the competitive applications of money transfer and the like are going to have to build Lightening as a protocol into their applications. And we've got a number of years of development there, but **the significance of Lightning is it takes Bitcoin from being viewed just as an asset and as a low frequency, high volume -- a low-frequency, high-value settlement network and it takes it to the next level, which is becoming a high frequency, high volume, very, very functionally rich, scalable transaction network. And there will be, I think, an explosion of applications on top of the Bitcoin network that are empowered by Lightning. Another big development in Bitcoin this last quarter is the launch of Fidelity's 401k offering.**  
&gt;  
&gt;We're very enthusiastic about that. And of course, we're an early anchor partner with them on that launch. Bitcoin is better than gold. To call it digital gold is an understatement.  
&gt;  
&gt;**It really is the hardest money in the history of the world. But if you're thinking about generational wealth and if you wanted to leave something for your grandchildren or if you wanted a retirement fund, it's obviously a very, very compelling element of a 401k.** We just saw just on television today, one of the world's great macro investors, Paul Tudor Jones said, in the current economic environment, I certainly wouldn't be owning stocks and bonds. I mean, people are very skeptical of owning equities and owning bonds in an environment where you have hyperinflation and macroeconomic wins.  
&gt;  
&gt;So if I can't on stocks, and I can't own bonds, and what am I supposed to put in a 401k? And this is where Bitcoin comes. What have I wanted to hold some kind of commodity money that's better than a commodity because no one can make any more of it. And Bitcoin is that thing. So I do think that -- the world is evolving rapidly.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's probably evolving faster than regulators and the mainstream media can keep up with it kind of like a shock wave. When you start moving through the civilization at a faster rate than people can educate themselves on the consequences, you'll see sparks, but the 401k launch was kind of the shot heard around the world here because what's going on here is people are going to have to stop and think about this and either this is the least risky thing you can put in a retirement portfolio or it's too risky to put in a retirement portfolio. **And of course, as soon as you think about it and study it, you'll realize that it's the least risky thing you could put in a retirement portfolio. At least that's the opinion of people that have studied Bitcoin for a while.**  
&gt;  
&gt;So the 401k offering from Fidelity is a massive educational event. It's going to put this front and center on the table for financial advisors, retirement planners, the entire big finance industry and I think, ultimately, it's going to introduce Bitcoin to an entirely new class of investors and broaden fill the asset class. So, I'd like to move on to talk about our Bitcoin strategy. We're going to continue to pursue a strategy which offers our investors spot exposure with leverage to Bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;So if you want to buy a security and you would like that security to own Bitcoin. And then you would like to -- and you think it would be a reasonable idea to borrow money at 1.8% interest and buy that Bitcoin then MicroStrategy looks like a rational company to invest in. We're going to work to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time in an accretive fashion. So we're not trading Bitcoin, we're not selling Bitcoin we're holding Bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;And from time to time, when we can, we'll buy more Bitcoin. If we focus upon the strategy, then we believe that we can offer a security to the market and be an operating company that, in essence, is superior to the security that you would get if you were to buy a spot ETF. We won't be an ETF. We're an operating company, and we have the software business.  
&gt;  
&gt;But for an investor that's thinking about buying an ETF that holds spot Bitcoin, they'll think about that. It will probably have no leverage, they'll probably pay a fee. And our goal will be to offer them the same Bitcoin holding, but without charging that fee and to use intelligent leverage from time to time when the opportunity presents itself. I was very, very pleased with the Bitcoin backed loan that we were able to acquire this quarter.  
&gt;  
&gt;We'll obviously use that mechanism sparingly because generally, we're not going to want to develop a large set of obligations where we might have to post additional collateral on a price fluctuation of Bitcoin. So managing our balance sheet versus the risk in the volatility of Bitcoin is primary concern we're always thinking about. We will slow down our Bitcoin acquisitions when market conditions don't present us with any good opportunities. And when the market presents us with lots of good opportunities, we may speed up.  
&gt;  
&gt;And you'll just have to tune in quarter-by-quarter to see what we do there. We have the option to do nothing. And if the market doesn't give us a good option or we have the option to do things. You can see at this point, we've now bought Bitcoin with senior secured debt.  
&gt;  
&gt;We bought Bitcoin with a tender offer. We bought Bitcoin with cash flows from the core business. We bought Bitcoin with convertible debt. We bought Bitcoin with at-the-market equity issuance and we bought Bitcoin with an asset-backed financing.  
&gt;  
&gt;And we pursued each of those initiatives at the time we did it because we thought that they would be accretive to our common stock shareholders and beneficial to our long-term strategy. My last point I'll make before we take questions are; we will continue to pursue a mission of education and advocacy on behalf of Bitcoin to the general market. As the largest public holder of bitcoin, it makes sense for us to educate regulators. It makes sense for us to educate other corporations, it makes sense for us to educate anyone in the media or any politicians that are interested and what this means to the world, and why it's good for the world, why it's good for the United States, why it's good for their corporation, their institution and then how they can benefit and plug Bitcoin into their P&amp;L or plug it into their balance sheet.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you don't follow me on Twitter, please do. I now just cross 2.4 million followers. And I try to share thoughts about the current environment on a pretty routine basis. I'm pleased to say that by the end of the day today or tomorrow, a podcast I did with Lex Friedman on YouTube will have crossed 2 million views.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I sat down with Lex in my study at my home in Miami Beach, and we talked for four hours about digital transformation and the bitcoin imperative. And our strategy and, of course, macroeconomics and geopolitics. And it's not easy to put 2 million people into your living room. But 2 million people listening for four hours is a lot of education, and we'll continue to do more of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I feel that where there's an enormous thirst for knowledge about digital assets. There's enormous thirst for knowledge about the implications of Bitcoin to the world and the entire crypto economy. There's a lot of education to do. We're nowhere near done.  
&gt;  
&gt;We're really just starting, but we have established a platform to do that and we will get more and more opportunities to communicate this message and educate the world. I'll continue with our efforts working with Bitcoin miners through the Bitcoin Mining Council and the entire Bitcoin community to address misperceptions about mining to explain the benefits of Bitcoin, the benefits of coin mining. We just had another quarterly release of Bitcoin mining information where we were able to show the world for the fourth quarter in a row, **Bitcoin mining is running on more than 50% sustainable energy, in fact, 58%. 58% sustainable energy usage makes the Bitcoin mining industry, the cleanest, most sustainable industry in the world of all industries.**  
&gt;  
&gt;And that was a surprise to many people. It continues to be a surprise to many people, but it's a delightful surprise. **Bitcoin mining in general, is 63% more efficient year over year. And a lot of people don't realize that the Bitcoin network is secured, not just by energy, but by technology and that technology is getting exponentially more efficient overtime.**  
&gt;  
&gt;So I'm really pleased that we're able to educate the world on the efficiencies of the Bitcoin network and the benefits of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. I think that there is a lot more education to do. Our leadership role in acquimiamiring and holding bitcoin as a publicly traded company. It's afforded us a platform to do a lot of that education and we'll continue to do that in the coming year.",cryptocurrency,1651682483

CryptoCurrency,This whole CRO fiasco illustrates how misled people are by the HODL mentality,"Just go look on the Crytpo\_com subreddit and you'll see what I mean, so many people seem to be angry at CDC, saying how they hodled like they were meant to at 0.90 and watched it dump to now, as if they've been treated unfairly as speculators.

The sad truth is that the staking rewards and card rewards CDC were handing out were never gonna be sustainable. Soon enough the \[trigger warning\] ponzi scheme was gonna come crashing down. CDC is a company in a sector with very little regulation and they were always gonna try make as much of a profit as possible. Does anyone really think they care about the CRO holders? CDC was offloading their bags up at 0.90.

AND THE STAKING REWARDS AREN'T EVEN THE MOST SUSPICIOUS PART.

Kris Marszalek, current CDC CEO also happens to be the former CEO of a company known as [Ensogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensogo), a now defunct social commerce website, basically connecting buyers and sellers of unused vouchers and discounts for different things. The company abruptly shut down with Marszalek simultaneously stepping down from his position in 2016, amid [allegations of fraud](https://librehash.org/crypto-com-anatomy-of-a-cryptocurrency-scam-part-two/) from business partners. And that was before the whole Monaco business even started.

The bottom line here is we in the crypto sphere have gotten too used to promoting fantastical gains and easy financial wins just by HODLing and being a good boy. We romanticize our tokens far too much, understandably though because it represents our wealth, and makes us feel intelligent for ""choosing the right one"". But for most of the remaining CRO bagholders, CDC chose them. It chose them with the well targeted reddit ads, the insanely aggressive sports marketing, and the allure of it's too-good-to-be-true promises about VISAs and staking. But anyone who questions that is written off as a non-believer, or NGMI.   
  
The ridiculous gains one can potentially realize in crypto make us far too blind to the real monetary risks we're taking betting on unregulated for-profit exchanges peddling false promises, then patting one another on the back for HODLing, especially in these macro-economic conditions. You think CDC announced their staking rate changes a couple of days before the fed rate hike by coincidence? Please, for your own sake, don't HODL and then get angry when you lose money. Question your own convictions and take extra time to really, really learn what it is you're getting into, or the lambo dream will make you lose sight of what you're getting involved in.",cryptocurrency,1651688747

CryptoCurrency,Fed meeting: raising rates by the expected half percent. JPOW feeling more optimistic with economic numbers. Stock are going up. What this all means for markets and crypto...,"Bullish news overall, at least short term.

# Background: how high are those Fed rates eventually gonna go and how big is the effect?

It's important to keep things in perspective.

Lowering or increasing rates, doesn't necessarily mean we'll have very high or very low rates.

In fact, Fed rates are only going up from a near 0 floor. We're not jumping from high rates to higher rates.

The long term plan by the Fed is to target around 2 -2.5%.

This is far from being high rates. These are still low rates designed more to stimulate an economy. With cost of borrowing still not very expensive.

In fact, 2% is simply going back to 2020 rates and the pre-covid normal.

&amp;#x200B;

# The key points of the JPOW's meeting:

\-0.5 fed hikes as expected, following the roadmap to 2%.

\-75 basis points moved off the table. This lowers a lot of uncertainty.

\-Unemployment at one of the lowest in 50 years.

\-Wages moving up.

\-According to JPOW, inflation has likely peaked, and expects it to go down.

\-The economy is ""not vulnerable to a recession"" and ""the economy is doing fairly well"" according to JPOW.

\-JPOW's tone has changed since the last meeting. From a somber dovish tone, to a more hawkish and optimistic tone.

&amp;#x200B;

# What does it mean for Bitcoin and ultimately crypto?

The US has the biggest share of the Bitcoin market, so while this may seem very US-centric, what happens in the US could affect the crypto market.

Probably not as much as most people would expect.

While the correlation between Bitcoin and US stocks has increased since Covid, it has only increased from nearly 0 and weak correlation, to only a moderate and inconsistent correlation.

The correlation works more strongly, when the crypto market is already more vulnerable to move in that direction.

Right now, crypto has been testing lows, and may have been forming a bottom.

If stocks do well and go up, it could help boost crypto in going in the path of least resistance, which right now is up.

There is one important effect that should still affect the crypto market: liquidity.

Even if whales trading bots don't care about the cost of a car loan increasing, they do care about liquidity coming into the market.

&amp;#x200B;

# Additional data about the current state of the US economy:

US real GDP growth has decreased at a rate of about 1.4% this quarter.

Unemployment is down to 3.8%.

Consumer expenditure has increased 2.7% despite inflation.

Residential investment has gone up 2%.

The trade gap has increased to $110 Billion.

Covid cases have been steadily rising this year to about 30K per day for the US. They are still much lower than last summer, and compared to the major part of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

The policy remains the same: kicking the can down the road.

Don't bet the farm on a great depression just yet. It's possible, but... realize that it's not the only scenario at play. We are still at a tipping point where it could go either way.

We are still in a potential scenario where this was just a correction. Likely more due to the extra liquidity turned off, and liquidity getting more back to normal, and the market having to re-adjust to reality with no more extra money printed.

So it's not completely out of the question that the stock market could eventually resume its run, as businesses re-open, supply chains unclog, economic growth picks up again, inflation stabilizes, and maybe even the war in Ukraine ends or becomes less uncertain.

If markets pick up again, that will be very good for bringing back liquidity into crypto, along with confidence. 

For now, the more short term result of this meeting on crypto, the odds favoring going for the path of least resistance to test $40K again.",cryptocurrency,1651692174

personalfinance,I believe my company is mismanaging my 401k.,"So, about two weeks ago, I went under contract on a house. I planned to take a loan out against my 401k, to cover some closing costs. I applied for the loan and it said it was approved, on the John Hancock website. It said it was to be deposited next paycheck, 4/29/22. The money was not deposited. When I called JH to find out why I was told that my plan administrator never approved it. I went to her , (the daughter of the ceo of my small company), and was told she had not been contacted by them, and even wagged her finger at me. When I called JH back, they said , the trustee (her dad) never authorized her to approve it. They have since approved the loan, and it will be deposited tomorrow. I decided to look through my 401k transactions and noticed that the contributions are both highly variable, per check, and often are not taken out in a timely manner. There are contributions from January and February of this year that have yet to enter my account. I suppose I don’t have any direct evidence that they are stealing, but it all raises many red flags. Thoughts?

EDIT: In addition, the 401k person said that there is not enough cash in the main 401k account to cover all the missing contributions. I guess I don’t understand where the missing money is.

EDIT 2: I have contacted the DOL to have an agent contact me regarding this.

Edit 3: I sent my dad, a cpa, all my 401k statements and pay stubs for the past year. He thinks they are both skimming from 401ks to pay expenses and failing to pay federal withholding . So yeah

personalfinance,When does it make sense to pay off my mortgage,"Hi, /r/PersonalFinance! 

TL;DR - When (if ever) does it make sense to pay off a mortgage ""early"" assuming one has the cash available? 






Possibly useless background: 

I'm a debt- and risk- adverse 30-something with a decent job which has left me in the position of having liquid assets equal to about 160% of my annual gross income. (I should really invest a bit more aggressively but see: 'risk adverse' and the few financial advisors I've talked to all left me with a somewhat scummy and ""I'm really not excited to talk to you ever again"" feeling). 

I am married but my wife and I maintain totally separate finances, and based on her student loan repayment schedule, have to file as ""Married Filing Separately"" to avoid my income being factored into her income-based repayments which would considerably increase her monthly spend. We also maintain two primary residences in two different taxing jurisdictions (OH and DC) 

Currently my only debt is my mortgage which I'm paying about 25% more in extra principal each month, and the interest rate is fairly low. I'm at the point where if I were to pay the outstanding principal on my mortgage as of today I'd still have about 92% of my annual gross in liquid form. This year was also the point at which my spend on mortgage interest was low enough that it made itemizing vs. taking the standard deduction essentially a wash.

On one hand I'd love to be truly debt free and save the couple hundred (and declining) in interest each month; on the other knowing that I have a big cushion if I decide to say ""F the world"" or the world decides to say ""F you""",finance,1651696392

CryptoCurrency,Public Policy (Lecture 8 - MIT 2018 lectures about Blockchain &amp; Money),"This lecture was about the connection of the crypto market with other actors, such as the judicial power, the administrative power and the legislative power. 

**Key public policy frameworks**

Key public policy frameworks are frameworks in which the government wants to:

1. be a watchdog against illicit acitivities
2. ensure financial stability 
3. practice investor protection. 

**Intermediaries**

How do key public frameworks relate to the crypto sphere, which after all operates without intermediaries (and would intermediaries in the non-crypto world feel threatened by the blockchain, which can replace some activities)?

Why does so much of the law center around intermediaries?

1. to exert political influence,
2. to protect the system from failing,
3. there’s not enough money to check every actor in the financial sphere, so intermediaries can provide checks,
4. consumer protection,
5. incumbents (incumbent = someone in an official position; someone holding office) can create barriers to enter,
6. incumbents can start collecting rents

Cryptocurrency sits currently (this was in 2018!!) in some of the gaps of the regulatory framework; the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission, because crypto could be a commodity) probably doesn’t have as much authority in crypto as the SEC has on the security markets. And even if the gap was to be closed, some coins are so private and secure that they almost entirely prevent regulation.

**Property? Currency? Value? Investment Contract? Commodity? Incumbents want to know.**  
   
 

* For the government, it’s of importance to decide whether crypto coins can be deemed property, a currency, value, an investment contract or commodities.
* A characteristic of a security is that there’s an issuer; naturally, there will be an information assymmetry, because the person raising money will know more than the investing person. That raises questions, such as: ‘What’s a fair exchange of information?’. 
* The Howey Test (1946): The Supreme Court had to pass a judgement on what the legal status of the citrus groves of mister Howey were. They judged that it was a security. This sounds very strange, but there’s a story attached to it. Howey figured he could sell part of his land in Florida as citrus groves. So the question was: when he was selling that land, could that actually have been an investment contract? Because in 1933, the Congress of the US put into law that a security could be many different things, among which an investment contract. Because of this law, it was decided that the groves were an investment contract. 4 characteristics had to be checked off in order for somehting to be an investment: 

1. **An investment of money or assets;** in practice, if you use Ether to buy BTC, that Is seen as an investment of money or assets
2. **An investment in a common enterprise;** is there a group of developers, then that’s a common enterprise. Some people want to debate this and say it’s open source softare, but that’s not deemed a good enough argument
3. **A reasonable expectation of profits;** If I buy a token and I use 5 ETH to pay for it, and I expect that it will be 10 ETH tomorrow, then that’s a reasonable expectation of profits
4. **Being reliant on the efforts of a promotor or others;** Such as ICOs; there were 200-300 ICOs a month in 2018)

Regarding these 4 criteria, you can think about it like the Duck Test. 

If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s probably a duck. 

If it looks like a security, etc, etc, then it’s probably a security. It’s important to get that right, because you don’t want an unexpected visit from the IRS, the justice department or the SEC. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The incumbents are eyeing crypto finance.** 

Why are incumbents  interested in crypto finance? 

1. It’s highly volatile. According to Gensler, volatility can be your friend (big companies can usurp smaller company’s market share in times of volatility)
2. Coinbase has20 million accounts (in 2018!), as many or more than big brokerage firms; so that’s a lot!
3. Startups are more willing to make mistakes and beg for forgiveness, while the big companies  of incumbents often can’t, because of their reputation.
4. Incumbents want to serve customer interest; gain a share of profits and protect their own franchises (such as  exchanges and companies, for instance Nasdaq and CME, Eurex and Intercontinental Exchange).

&amp;#x200B;

**Guard against illicit activity**

* The global context is still in an early stage. In a global context, there is (this was in 2018) a broad consensus on policy (law enforcement). But countries were inconsistent on implementatin.
* Two departments of the US Department of Treasure labled Bitcoin differently. One of the departments said BTC was a property, and the others said that it was a virtual currency. This department had to call Bitcoin a currency, because it wanted to bring Bitcoin under the Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act was passed a few decades ago. Through KYC (know your customer) it protects the banks against money laundering. If you make a large transaction of more than $10k, then the bank is obliged to report this. 
* An example of an illicit activity is: drug couriers get paid with a USB stick that contains a private key of a filled Bitcoin Wallet
* There are a few challenges about guarding against illicit activity (x7):

1. Pseudonymous Addresses
2. Privacy Coins (like Zcash and Monero) and Mixers and Tumblers
3. Compliance and Reporting; private people usually don’t fill out a 600 pages book as an audit.
4. Crypto to Crypto Transactions: if Bitcoin is bought with fiat money, that’s easy to see for regulators (on ramp). The same goes for when it is sold (off ramp). Because regulated intermediaries are in the system of the Bank Secrecy Act. Crypto to crypto is a lot harder to track, because that doesn’t require a commercial bank. And it’s probably easier to stay off the tax, because there’s a lack of reporting.
5. Decentralized exchanges. 
6. Dark Markets, For example, Silk Road where you can buy and sell illegal things like drugs. The payments were mostly in Bitcoin and the used technology was TOR (TOR = (investopedia definition) an open-source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing, through the use of secure, encrypted protocols).
7. State Actors for example: allegedly Russia used BTC to mess with the US elections.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial stability**

* Is crypto market is not yet (as of 2018) large enough to really worry about; the total market cap was $0.25T in 2018. In 2018 the crypto space was only a quarter of a trillion dollar, while the worldwide debt market was $250 trillion in 2018, so 1000 x bigger than the crypto market. And the worldwide equity market is about 90 trillion, and the worldwide stock of gold is (in 2018) 7 trillion. So they are monitoring the cryptomarket, but not in a systemic way. 
* Financial stability is an urgent matter in in countries that have capital control (currency control = the state controls the purchase and sell of the national currency in exchange for foreign fiat), because crypto can have an effect on the financial stability of such a country. For example, in China you can’t take renminbi (Chinese yuan) abroad. Bitcoin could serve as a bridge function for people who want to evade this law: convert Chinese money into Bitcoin and then convert Bitcoin to dollars or euros. With the big mining operations in China, that’s essentially a way to get around capital controls. So the miners use renmimbi for equipment and electricity, they mine Bitcoin, and they convert it to dollars and euros. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Possible future developments in many countries**

* Crypto leverage (leverage = (binance.academic definition: ) **using borrowed capital to trade cryptocurrencies or other financial assets**. ). Crypto exchanges can offer leverage, for instance 1 to 100 Bitcoin (more usual is 1 to 10 Bitcoin). The disadvantages of leverage are that it creates systemic risk and it can accellerate a crisis.
* A blockchain market infrastructure. For example Australia is using blockchain to issue and settle stocks (stock settlement = the legal transfer of shares between the buyer and seller on the settlement date).
* Central Bank Digital Currencies

&amp;#x200B;

**CBDC**

A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would entail that a person doesn’t have to deposit to a commercial ban to get US dollars; he can deposit straight with the Federal Reserve instead! In for instance Sweden, you can allready deposit straight with the Sweden Central Bank. A possible danger is that people will run away from commercial bans t central banks. And isn’t there also the danger that it might undermine monetary policy of a central bank issues a digital currency?

**Protect the investors**

*  Investor protection =/= consumer protection. 
*  Investor protection is a layer on top of consumer protection so it’s a bit more elaborate than consumer protection.
* Consumer protection is about trasactions and the fraud that can occur in a transaction (such as selling a motorcycle, buying a bed, buying an apple). 
* Investor protection, on top of that, is with issues having information assymmetries  (issuer = (investopedia definition) a legal entity that develops, registers and sells securities to finance its operations. Issuers may be corporations, investment trusts, or domestic or foreign governments. Issuers make available securities such as equity shares, bonds and warrants). That means that the issuer (the person raising money) knows something and the purchaser does not know that information. And secondly, pre-trade and post-trade transparancy, so that economic activity is promoted because you can rely on the framework.
* Investor protection goes a lot further than consumer protection (x4) : 

1. Investors get full disclosure from insurers
2. fraudulent and deceptive sales are prohibited
3. price transparancy and anti-manipulation
4. advisors have some additional respnisbilities, such as fiduciary responsibility and best effort responsibility, and they should disclose and minimize a conflict of interest.

* If there’s a new technology (in the past train rails and the internet, now crypto) how do you then promote economic activity, while you keep on promoting whatever social goods you’re trying to promote in some regulatory framework? Gensler doesn’t think these two are necessarily in conflict with one another and he attributes many decades of prosperity to the regimes and reforms of the 1930s in the US (and decades later in other countries). 
* Gensler is of the opinion that investor protection lowers the risk to issuers and lowers the cost of capital (cost of capital = (investopedia definition) the return a company needs to achieve in order to justify the cost of a capital project, such as purchasing new equipment or constructing a new building).
* Investor Protection gives confidence in capital markets.
* Issuers and investors both benefit from economic growth.
* **Market integrity** = there’s not fraud and manipulation in that market. Market activity is being promoted if you as an investor can have confidence in central market structures. So there will be pre-trade transparancy and post-trade transparancy. The more transparant, the more you can root out manipulation and fraud. Thanks to market integrity, the risk premium is lower (risk premium = (wikipedia definition) A risk premium is a measure of excess return that is required by an individual to compensate being subjected to an increased level of risk). Further more, market integrity causes there to be more competition in the price discovery function.
* Crypto exchanges are not moderated for market integrity. There are no laws that prevent that an exchange frontruns its customer (frontrun (dictionary.com definition) = the practice by market makers of using advance information provided by their won investment analysts before giving that informatien to their clients). For instance, Michael wants to buy a $5000 Bitcoin from an exchange. But without telling Michael, the exchange has quickly bought the Bitcoin it intends to sell to Michael for only $4960. So the exchange secretly makes extra money on Michael’s order.
* Japan had one of the earliest crypto exchanges: Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox went down and $0.5B was lost. That was caused by many hacks. Following that event, Japan changed the law for customer protection. The exchanges needed to be registered. But it was a completely successful measure, because later on, another $0.5B was stolen from a Japnaese exchange.
* US and Canada are progressive, because they see ICOs as securities and theyhave to be protected. Gensler thinks that many people would want to implement investor protection when the total crypto market cap goes x5 or x10 or x20.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tax Compliance and Reporting**

* How do you treat Bitcoin for tax purposes? In 2013, the US Government decided that Bitcoin was a property. So every time you exchange it, you have to record it and pay taxes about it. You can’t consolidate like in stocks. Some other countries (but not many) treat Bitcoin as a currency, so eligible for capital gains tax. 
* How about when you mine BTC or ETH, how are those coins to be viewed? The mined coins should be treated like income, so they will fall under tax law.

&amp;#x200B;

**US Agency Contracts for Blockchain Analysis**

Many US departments want to keep an eye on the blockchain. They use third parties (specialized companies) to analyze blockchain and crypto for them. The most US Agency Contracts were given out by (in this order): IRS, ICE, FBI, Fiscall Service, DEA, SEC and CFTC.

&amp;#x200B;

**Location of crypto exchanges**

Some crypto exchanges from Hong Kong and South Korea reinstated in Malta, Belize and Seychelles for reasons of regulatory arbitrage (regulatory arbitrage = (investopedia definition) a corporate practice of utilizing more favorable laws in one jurisdiciton to circumvent less favorable regulation elsewhere. This practice is often legal as it takes advantage of existing loopholes; however, it is often considered unethical).

&amp;#x200B;

**How does public policy come together?**

It’s not ideal, but there are 3 steps to it:

Step 1: Messaging (you have to have a clear message to be heard, a non-crypto related message is for example Trump’s Maga message)

Step 2: Build coalitions (you won’t make it on your own, you need others. For example miners and exchanges should think about getting in touch with eachother in order to make a fist). And personnel is policity; it matters who sits in the chairs.They have different risk profiles, a differen knowledge base, etc. 

Step 3: Analysis (logically the only step that counts, but the others 2 are unfortunately necessary in current society).",cryptocurrency,1651698719
personalfinance,Check my math: ARM cheaper than fixed rate?,"Currently debating a 10/6 ARM or 30 yr fixed rate mortgage. I'd like a sanity check on my math because it seems like, even in the worst case scenario (which I understand is highly likely with how interest rates are trending), the ARM is the better deal **if you put the difference toward the principal**. These are the best rates we qualified for:

Loan details:

* $625k purchase price, 20% down ($125K)
* 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 5.875%
* 10/6 APR at 4.625%; 5% first adjustment; 5% lifetime cap

If we were to take the ARM, we would apply the difference in monthly payments to the principal (until the loan is paid off, not just for the first 10 years). If my math is correct, even in the worst case scenario (9.625% APR after the 10 years) that would save us **$60k in interest over the life of the loan** and pay it off 5 years early compared to the 30 year fixed:

&amp;#x200B;

||Fixed rate mortgage|ARM|ARM w/ prepayment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Interest rate (%)|5.875|4.625|4.625|
|Prepayment|0|0|386.99|
|Initial monthly payment|2,957.69|$2,570.70|2,957.69|
|Total cost of mortgage|$1,064,767.97|$1,215,776.33|$1,003,555.79|

Cost savings: **$61,212.18**

Today I made $2200 in my portfolio. Yesterday I didn't have that money. My new method is to lock in profits on every green day from now on since we're in volatile markets and eventually I believe we hit 3500 or less when fed starts reducing their $9 trillion balance sheet.

So today I made $2200 and tomorrow hopefully I can sell $1100.  Once you make you're money you've won! It's like getting an $1100 stimulus check!

This way also I'm increasing my cash from its present 30% for the inevitable downside.

The alternative is to watch the market take away the $2200 I just ""made"" over the next days or weeks! F that! Sick of that sh!t!

I really don't need anyone to tell me how stupid it was, I already know.

Ok, with that aside, here are some details. In 2020 I started working with what I thought was a debt consolidation company that would consolidate 3 credit cards and 2 extremely high interest rate personal loans and help me get out of the trap of just paying the interest every month. They told me that my credit would take a brief hit but that it would recover within a year. Yes, I believed this. 

Anyway, I have completely paid off everything and all but one of the accounts are now settled. All three credit cards have been reported as closed on my account with no late payments and one of the loans was also reported as closed with no late payments.

The other loan was from Upgrade. Upgrade reported late payments every month for the entirety of the time I was in the ""program"" despite having been in a settlement and receiving payments every month. I have called and talked to multiple people about why Im still showing a balance for the loan on my credit report and why they reported late payments from Nov 2020 (when the settlement was reached) through March 2022 (when the settlement was paid in full) but everyone tells me something different every time I talk to them. 

None of the other accounts that I had reported late payments every month. Every time I ask Upgrade to explain the late payments they basically tell me they don't know and that they will look into it and call me back, then they never do. I wait a couple days and then call again and it's the same cycle.

Fidelity mailed me recharacterizations letters that state: based on your request to recharacterize $XXXX and applicable IRS regulations pertaining to IRA recharacterizations, the total applicable earnings or loss for the computation period was $XXX and the total amount recharacterized was $XXXX. The amount of the recharacterization reported on your next statement and tax forms issued next January (form 5438 and form 1099-R) may be slightly different than this calculation due to intra-day price fluctuations of the securities recharacterized.

I interpret this to mean that my CPA should be able to use form 5438 and form 1099-R as generally adequate information to file my federal taxes. I also sent IRA transactions for 2021 and copies of the recharacterization requests. I also sent every tax form I could find in Fidelity.

Instead, he's asking me about the date of 2020 overcontribution, what date a recharacterization occurred, etc. How much of this information is necessary? I'm concerned that he's wasting billable time calculating earnings and losses that are already reported on forms, especially because it's already been a stressful working relationship.

It also feels unreasonably late to be asking me about this in May when I originally laid out that I had a complicated situation when the business relationship started in mid 2021.

stocks,Markets cheer after Powell downplays even larger rate hikes,"Markets cheer after Powell downplays even larger rate hikes

2:01 AM ET, 05/04/2022 - Associated Press

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks soared to their biggest gain in two years Wednesday and bond yields dropped after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell downplayed the likelihood of an even larger rate increase than the one just announced Wednesday. That allayed concerns that the central bank was on its way to a massive increase of three-quarters of a percentage point at its next meeting in June. The comments came after the Fed announced a half-point increase in its benchmark rate as part of its effort to fight inflation. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 3%. The yield on the 2-year Treasury fell sharply, to 2.64%.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks rallied and bond yields fell on Wall Street Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell downplayed the likelihood of an even larger interest rate hike after announcing the sharpest rate increase since 2000.

The remarks, which came after the Fed announced its decision to raise its key interest rate by double the usual amount, allayed concerns that the central bank was on its way to a massive increase of three-quarters of a percentage point at its next meeting in June.

The S&amp;P 500 climbed 2.9% as of 3:39 p.m. Eastern, on pace for its best day since May 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 899 points, or 2.7%, to 34,028, and the Nasdaq climbed 3% after earlier having been in the red.

Bond yields fell after the Fed’s announcement. The yield on the 2-year Treasury dropped to 2.65% from 2.78% late Tuesday, an unsually large move. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, fell to 2.92% from 2.96% It had initially jumped to 3.01% until Powell’s remarks during a press conference.

The comments came shortly after the Fed said it raised its benchmark short-term interest rate by a half-percentage point, it’s most aggressive move since 2000, and signaled further large rate hikes ahead. The increase raised the Fed’s key rate to a range of 0.75% to 1%, the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago.

The Fed also announced details of how it will start reducing its huge holdings of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, a tool the central bank has used to help keep long-term interest rates low.

The latest move by the Fed had been widely expected, with markets steadying this week ahead of the policy update, but Wall Street was concerned the Fed might elect to raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in the months ahead.

Powell eased those concerns, saying the central bank is “not actively considering” such an increase.

The VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&amp;P 500, fell about 11%, one of its biggest drops this year, after Powell's remarks.

Earlier, Powell also said the economy can make it through rate increases without falling into a recession.

“The economy is strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy,” he said, though he cautioned “it’s not going to be easy.”

Investors are worrying about whether the Fed can pull off the delicate dance to slow the economy enough to halt high inflation but not so much as to cause a downturn. Still, the market cheered the Fed's latest moves.

“It’s certainly heady days when the market doesn’t blink at the most aggressive rate hike in 22 years, but keep in mind this was extremely well-telegraphed and priced in,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director, investment strategy at E-TRADE from Morgan Stanley.

The central bank also announced that it will start reducing its huge $9 trillion balance sheet, which consists mainly of Treasury and mortgage bonds, starting June 1.

Energy stocks were among the biggest gainers Wednesday following a 5.3% increase in the price of U.S. crude oil after Europe took a step closer to placing an embargo on Russian oil as that country continues its war against Ukraine. Any embargo could strain oil supplies and push prices still higher. Exxon Mobil rose 3.7%.

The Fed’s aggressive shift to raise interest rates comes as rising inflation puts more pressure on businesses and consumers. Higher costs for energy and other commodities have prompted many businesses to raise prices and issue cautious forecasts to their investors. Wall Street and economists are worried that higher prices on everything from food to gas and clothing will prompt a slowdown in consumer spending and crimp economic growth.

The worries have worsened with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on energy and key food commodity prices. China’s increasingly stricter lockdown measures because of rising COVID-19 cases have also added concerns about slower economic growth because of supply problems and shipping backlogs.

Wall Street is closely watching economic data for any signs that inflation might be easing. Consumer prices surged in March, but a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy had its smallest monthly rise since September. That was a welcome sign for investors and more of the same in the coming months cold temper inflation concerns.

“If we can get just a few more readings showing inflation slowing, that could be the match that sparks some confidence,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial.

Tupperware slumped 33.8% after the direct seller of plastic storage containers and cosmetics withdrew its financial forecast for the year following a highly disappointing first quarter. The company cited pressure from inflation, lockdowns in China and the conflict in Ukraine.

Lyft plunged 29.8% after the ride-hailing company gave investors a disappointing revenue forecast for its current quarter.

Airbnb jumped 7.1% after the short-stay home rentals company sharply narrowed its first-quarter loss and gave investors an encouraging revenue forecast. Starbucks vaulted 10.9% after reporting surprisingly strong sales at stores that have been open at least a year, which is a key measure of health for retailers.

My scenario:
We got a rate lock about two weeks ago. Signed an intent to proceed for the purchase of a condo unit. Mostly going smoothly until today.
Today I got told that the loan couldn't go through because the developer had too many units as a single entity for me to get a Fannie/Freddie loan. I told the bank that this was a misinterpretation of the condo questionnaire because I knew for a fact that the developer was selling all but two of the units. A few phone calls later to the developer and the bank, it's all sorted out.
Now I get told that because it's a new condo it hasn't been ""approved"" yet, and would have to be approved by the investor. And that for some reason this meant that the rate lock I had with the bank was no longer valid because I would have to rate lock with the investor directly... Obviously this means that I can't keep the same rate unless I now pay points.

personalfinance,[Student Loans] I'm Considering Switching to the Extended Graduated Plan,"I'm considering switching my student loan payment plan to the extended graduated plan.

My interest rate on the student loans is very low (3.55%), lower than expected index fund returns (vtsax) over 25 years, and even lower than ibonds give currently. Inflation can eat at the loan.

Is there any drawback to doing this? The small amount of risk this entails has already been accounted for and will not be an issue.

I could still continue making extra payments on the loan if I wanted to, right? Could I still pay it off early if I wanted?

Does changing a payment plan count as a refinance or consolidation? I didn't think it would, but just checking.

Also, is there a fee for switching payment plans?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1651712410

personalfinance,"Only notable debt is Mortgage and federal student loans, looking for advice","Hi, I am 32 y/o and I decided to test the waters in the job market earlier this year because I was feeling chronically underpaid and undervalued in my last organization. I ended up in veritably my ""dream job"" and took a 52% pay raise. Since this is my first time in my current title I am on the very low end of the payscale for my field, but I still make $73,000 per year. 

I live in the midwest, so my expenses are very low. Per month my living expenses are $1450~ (mortgage, utilities, streaming services etc) and after my 12% 401(k) (pre-tax) contributions, and other pre-tax benefits and just anscilary spending I have around $1350 left to allocate to savings, debt payment and investments. My only real tangible debts outside of my mortgage is a 401(k) loan at my last company which has $8,500 (not in danger of defaulting as my company has a coupon system for terminated loan repayments) and federal student loans. Those are around $30,000.

Outside of retirement I don't have much in the way of savings, and would like to build around a $15k emergency fund and work towards eventually maxing out a roth IRA and make contributions to a brokerage in the future. Should I start working towards getting my savings underneath me or aggressively attack my student loans first?

personalfinance,Self-Employed Defined Benefit Plan for Consulting Income Windfall?,"Background:

I have a consulting contract with a startup company on a lucrative limited term project.  My consulting compensation package has a small base fee and a percentage of profit.  Well, it turns out my income from this is multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars.  (This is a Reddit account I set up just for this because I really don't need lots of people knowing about my windfall.)

I already put $6,000 in my IRA (yes, I did a backdoor Roth).  I'm also putting $61,000 in my self-employed 401(k).  I bought $10,000 in I-bonds.  (I also have a pension from a couple old government jobs I had, but I won't file for my retirement until I'm 63 in order to maximize the pension payout, and I maxed out my 457 account employee contributions when I worked in those jobs.)

My only debt is my mortgage, but I did a refi in 2021, so my interest rate is way low.  I've already decided what my charitable giving will be this year.  I'm single and have no children, so it doesn't really make sense to start a college fund for children who don't exist.  I've even already planned a couple vacations.  Age-wise, I'm in my late 30s.

Question:

My client's tax guy suggested I explore a **self-employed defined benefit plan**.  It looks interesting, as it allows a maximum tax-deductible contribution of $245,000 (or 100% of compensation for the highest 3 consecutive calendar years), which will be taxable when I start taking payouts.  My income in 2023 will come back down to more normal levels (\~$100K), so it's unlikely I will make another contribution to the DB plan, as I don't expect to get another contract like this again.  What are the pros and cons of doing the self-employed DB plan in my circumstances?  What factors should I be considering?

TLDR:

I made lots of one-time money from a contract. What are the pros and cons of setting up a self-employed defined benefit plan?",finance,1651714024

Trading,Can someone explain why the FED selling securities to reduce its balance sheet could cause interest rates to increase?,"Hey everyone, so I understand that the FED engaged in a purchase program called quantitative easing which goal is to keep interest rates low to help stimulate the economy during COVID.

I understand why keeping interest low is good to stimulate the economy.

But why does the FED need to purchase US securities in order to do that or why does it need to engage in quantitative easing?

They are the FED and they are the one who set interest rates. They lowered it in the past so why do they need to also buy securities? As far as I know, when the FED reduce the interest rates, economic actors such as banks will automatically adjust their rates for mortgages, auto loans, credit card interest rates etc and therefore the goal of lowering interest rate and stimulate the economy is achieved. Why also buy US securities to reduce the interest rates, they've just done it?

Similar question the other way around. Now the FED has increased interest rate to fight inflation.

But they will also be selling US securities they hold in their balance sheet and I read that it will have as an effect to increase interest rates.

I know this what the FED wants right now, increase interest rate but my question is more around the mechanism that involves selling securities, how does selling securities increase interest rate?

economy,JPow needs a recession,"JPow is hypocrisy personified. He is double speak at its best. On one hand, he'll say that inflation is a very big problem that needs to be tamed with the grit and strength of a resilient FED, but only raises rates a measly 0.5% to tackle what is 8% inflation? 

Then, in the same breath, he takes any sizeable rate hikes off the table because he sees inflation coming off in the second half of '22? Let's ignore the fact that the inflation Oracle was already wayyyyyy off on inflation being transitory as this same FED wasn't forecasting ANY rate hikes till 2024 at one point. 

Now, if for a second we believe JPow is accurate, which would be a first, how can he describe inflation as a very big problem on one hand, and in the other confidently shrug it off as disappearing in the back half of 2022 - swiftly proceeding to bumping rates up a quarter point above the BARE minimum? If this isn't double speak, I don't know what is. 

Here's the point. We will be back here in 6 months when the FED and every other talking head on mainstream media figures out that inflation, compounding at 4-8% annually, won't disappeare with itty bitty 0.50% rate hikes. Consider the fact that if inflation at the start of 2019 was 2%, 0% in 2020, but 4.5% in 21, 8% in 22, and hypothetically tracked at 7% for 23, 6% for 24, 4% for 25, that would mean that since 2019 prices have increased about 31%. 

So the Fed is going to revert prices back to the mean by implementing 2-3% neutral rate? In order to reel back that type of compounding inflation, the Fed would NEED to creat a recession so that there is 1 or 2 years of negative price growth.",finance,1651724477

My puppy has been battling a weird bout of nighttime diarrhea. He has had 2 days of looser but formed stools, however at his last pee break he will have pudding consistency diarrhea. He’s just under 18 weeks old, a week and a bit over his last vaccine rounds. 

He had suspected but not confirmed coccidia which was treated with baycox and metronidazole. No puking, no blood. A bit quicker to get tired and sleeping longer but that was long (1-2 weeks) before the diarrhea and happened in conjunction with little spots of blood starting to appear on his gums (teething). Tonight was the third night of a pudding diarrhea to end the night. 

He got Simparica Trio last Thursday so I doubt it would be from that, but is it possible? 

Puppy currently is fed Royal Canin German Shepherd puppy - we did crack a new bag open 2-3 days ago could it be a bad bag? Anyway, no other significant symptoms, could a coccidia reinfection be possible?

Vet last time passed on fecals, said it’s likely coccidia based on our area and treated. Is there a reason to freak out on this or is it a monitor and re-asses in a few days situation?",cryptocurrency,1651731044

personalfinance,My Chase credit card points were stolen... an educational story.,"I just finished reading some horror stories about Chase. Here is another, albeit obscenely long and not as scary. 

A while back, it was the end of the month and therefore time to pay my Chase credit card bill. I attempted to log in on the desktop site as usual, but I wasn't able to... the password wasn't correct. A few more attempts, no luck. Weird. Wait, caps lock? No, what the hell? Time to reset I suppose. 

After the password is now reset, I resume paying my balances. (I get some kinda of pleasure from being able to pay my bills off in one sitting, maybe because I know the pain of not being able to.) One card done, another and another, but wait a second, something seems off. It takes a minute to put my finger on it, but I haven't heard the ding of the payment email confirmation on my phone. 

Lo and behold, there are no email confirmations in my inbox. This is getting even stranger. A tinge of adrenaline and a sinking feeling in my stomach begins. Something is definitely fucked. 

I look through my accounts quickly, but I don't see anything. What is a hacker going to do, pay my bill for me, come on! I have been saving up my points for though, a good $1000 worth of wonderful reward points await... let me check those....

And they're gone. All of them. Redeemed that very same day. Well shit! 

A few minutes of facepalming and wondering how this could have happened, I think, wait, shouldn't I have gotten an email that these were redeemed? Sure enough, the hacker changed my email address domain. Kept my username, changed it to their domain. So I get it. They hijacked my account, changed my email address so I wouldn't be alerted to their redemption of my points. 

I call Chase's fraud department, and explain the situation to a gentleman who was obviously having a worse day than me. I am understanding fellow. He see's the redemption and understands the story, but a ""sorry, this looks legitimate and there is nothing I can do"" starts to come out. I maintained my composure and rebutted, ""listen, my account was hacked and my email was changed. Then my points disappeared."" ""What is your email sir?"" I tell him my email and he's says, ""Oh, I see. You didn't change your email address today? What is your physical address, did you change that too?"" My physical address doesn't match either. He closes my accounts, reissues me cards and puts in a request to refund my points. Done. 

So after this, I start to ask myself how this happened. This is a huge financial institution, one of the biggest banks. There were no mechanism to catch any of this? Where is the 2fa? Where is a text notification to confirm my point redemption. I look and look and look on the desktop site for 2fa. Nothing. I call customer service back and ask how I can turn on 2fa. They don't know. 

I then dig through the mobile app the next day and sure enough find an option to ""Add extra security when you sign in using a browser"". This setting is found in Chase's mobile app and adds a 2fa layer when signing into their desktop site.... yes thats right. The option to turn on 2fa for the browser, is in the mobile app. I just found that counter intuitive. Maybe I missed it on desktop site? Keep in mind I only have credit cards with Chase, so maybe banking customers have this option.

I call Chase back and let them know. The very nice and professional woman I spoke to says that is great to know. I suggest she escalate it up the ladder and she says she will share it in a weekly meeting she has. I tried. 

Meanwhile the cards have been reissued and take over a week to show up. They didn't bother expedite them, which you have to specifically request. I didn't have any other cards outside my chase cards so thank God for apple pay (which updated automatically when the cards were reissued) and having some cash in the bank, which by the way lead to a great budgeting lesson for my wife - having to calculate how much is in her shopping cart vs how much cash she has before checking out. I think we saved some money that week.

The points were reissued and I spent them right away. I also wiped my machine, changed all my passwords / usernames and turned on 2fa for everything I could. Good times. 

**Lessons learned:**

1. I committed the cardinal IT sin of using an old password. Carelessness.  Change your passwords and make them strong, even though this is hardly enough to protect anything in my opinion. Multiple layers of protection are your friend.
2. Turn 2fa on for Chase and everything for that matter, auth apps are probably better than sms. I have a yubikey now too. I told a coworker about this who banks with them personally and for his business (Thank God I hadn't banked with Chase), he confirmed there was no 2fa on the desktop site and promptly turned it on through the mobile app. You can do this on the app at: **Profile &amp; Settings &gt; Settings &gt; Security Center &gt; Add extra security when you sign in using a browser**
3. Consider **diversifying the payment options you have**. It might have been a little tricky if I was traveling overseas depending on these credit cards, only to have them all shut off at the same time.
4. If you lose your cards, **ask them to expedite their shipment**. 

**My theory on what happened:**

* When I logged in, I seem to remember some kind of odd glitchy refresh occurring, which took a fraction of a second. This could have the been the failed password reload, but it leads me to believe that my browser was hijacked or I somehow ended up on a spoofed login page. The hacker or bot then entered my account with the captured credentials and changed my email and physical address. Then wiped my points. 
* It occurred to me that I had several chrome extensions that I hadn't used in a while and were outdated... those were immediately removed. Maybe one of those were compromised? Not sure. No viruses were found by a virus scan.

Before the meeting there were 3 possible scenarios to occur and 1 was expected.

1. dovish Rhetoric. The fed decides to have a less aggressive impact on the economy by reducing the increments of the rate hikes (25bps / 0.25%)
2. Neutral(expected) The fed goes through with their expected 50bps (0.5%) rate hikes for the rest of the year
3. Hawkish rhetoric. The fed decides to attack inflation without caring too much about the impact on the economy and decides to implement 75bps (0.75%) rate hikes.

The market yesterday was expecting a 50bps rate hike (which occurred) BUT after the hike, Powell announced the likelihood of 25bps rate hikes in the following months rather than 50bps (turning the rhetoric from a previously hawkish, to a dovish, expecting a ""soft landing"" less aggressive impact on the economy.)

Hawkish rhetoric's tend  to strengthen a currency and tend to turn risk off. With a continuation of 75bps/50bps hikes we would've seen equities lose more value, gold lose more value and the dollar couldve blown past its 103.931 top.

A dovish rhetoric (what happened yesterday) turn risk on, given the major 1000pip move on US30, or massive hikes on equities and gold and the melt offs on the Dollar.

If you want to trade these events you must be aware of all the possible scenarios and their effect on the market. If you aren't willing to understand the fundamental side of things then trading events like this give you a good 50/50 probability set up since youre depending all on your bias to be the correct outcome of a meeting.

personalfinance,How are HSA withdrawals taxed if you move out of NJ?,"I understand that HSA’s are triple tax advantaged federally and in every state except NJ and CA. Those states just treat the account like a regular account so money going in and interest/dividends are taxed as income. And I believe when you take the money out, it’s not taxed at the state level (even if you’re 65 and not using it towards qualified medical expenses), because it’s not a special account in the eyes of those states.

My question is: what happens to the HSA if you contributed to it while in NJ, but then move to another states when you’re 65 and take out money for non-qualified expenses? Does the new state even consider it an HSA since you were already paying taxes on it?

I assume you pay state income tax on the withdrawals since that’s just how HSA’s work, but wouldn’t you have already paid income tax on the money going in? I can’t find an answer to this anywhere and my assumption seems unreasonable so I’m taking to Reddit for an answer.",finance,1651757288
personalfinance,Can I get a correct W2 from a previous year?,"tl;dr I need a corrected W2 from 2019 that said I worked in California when I didn't. Is this possible?


In 2019 I moved from TN (no income tax state) to California and since TN has really loose laws about last paychecks I just had them mail it to me at my new address in California. Well, whoever did it changed my address to California in the system so my last paycheck automatically pulled out California taxes. It was only like 30 bucks so I thought nothing of it.

It took me a little bit to get a new job but I started my new job on the first Monday in January 2020. I worked there for 15 months and then moved back to TN. I paid my 2020 California taxes with no problems and paid my 2021 California and Georgia taxes (I live on the boarded and work in GA) last month no problem but something must have updated in the CA tax system because now I'm getting mail about wayyy past due taxes from 2019 I owe CA and they are threatening to send it to collections. 

The amount they say I owe is up to a little over 1600 for fees and interest and whatnot. I've tried calling the CA tax number on the letters but the automated voice thing says it is at least a 3 hour wait and I always get disconnected 30 to an hour in.



I'm fairly certain this is from the 2019 TN company fucking up my address since I never actually worked in CA during 2019. Is it too late for them to correct this? Can I dispute it it even with it being wrong on my 2019 W2 as in it shows I got paid ""working in CA""?


Edit: I'd also like to add I did file taxes every year just not 2019 for CA specifically. TN doesn't require state income taxes so I only did Federal in 2019",finance,1651757725

gaming,Regarding the MMO/MMORPG Genre,"Hey, My thoughts on MMOs are that we have been fed too much shit to realise what a truly great MMO vision is because the genre is just in an iron lung at this point whispering faintly 'KILL ME'  
I propose an idea, to make a Super MMO that will last for years to come where over 10 or more companies pool in billions of dollars to fund the project and have 5000 maybe 20k or more active game developers and other staff, And work on a super MMORPG  
With features, Like an 1/5 or greater scale of Earth to roam in  
Dynamic server meshing with uncapped Population limit,  
a free class system with the ability to pick out of a range of 500 or more abilities  
Have areas be literal miles and take days to traverse have quest be an entire legendary adventure rather then mundane get me 3 apples from karen  
Maybe code an A.I to manage the universe and procedurally generate events all over this massive game, and so on something truly next GEN but no companies want to pool that much into it because in the short term it's more profitable to have a time wasting game filled with microtransactions then to make a game that really make the player happy with it

stocks,The Nasdaq was up 3.19% on Wednesday and has fallen -4.12% so far on Thursday. I guess a lot of people fell into yesterday's trap?,"Let's take a look at the state of the market today:

Technology stocks fell across the board, VIXY rose 9%, and even financial and banking stocks generally fell better than 2%. Is the market really going to crash?

Powell said on Wednesday that the current inflation rate is still severe and will continue to raise interest rates by 50 basis points to control severe inflation.

Continued interest rate hikes will consume market funds and have an impact on the capital market. In addition, inflation and economic uncertainty have exposed capital markets to the possibility of more uncertainty shocks. Institutional investors first smelled the market's bearishness and fled the market as it rebounded.

Regardless of whether the market crashes or not, I hope everyone can stay safe, keep cash, and you will have more opportunities in the future.

Regardless, US dollar strength is ***generally*** a bad sign for global growth and tighter financial conditions. With Europe seeing outsized weakness due to the Russia Ukraine conflict, energy shortages causing problems globally, and China going full zero tolerance on Covid, I suppose it's not that surprising that the USD has appreciated against peers.

Then you take all of that and add the fact that the Fed is raising rates while other central banks are remaining either neutral, are raising rates slower, or are still providing accommodation (japan) and it's a bit of a perfect storm for USD strength.

Worker productivity fell to start 2022 at its fastest pace in nearly 75 years while labor costs soared as the U.S. struggled with surging Covid cases, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.

Nonfarm productivity, a measure of output against hours worked, declined 7.5% from January through March, the biggest fall since the third quarter of 1947.

At the same time, unit labor costs soared 11.6%, bringing the increase over the past four quarters to 7.2%, the biggest gain since the third quarter of 1982. The metric calculates how much employers pay workers in salary and benefits per unit of output.

Wall Street already had been looking for a 5.2% drop in productivity and an increase of 10.5% in unit labor costs. On a four-quarter basis, productivity fell 0.6%, the biggest decline since the fourth quarter of 1993.

Taken together, the numbers underline the inflation surge in the U.S., which has seen prices rise at the fastest level in more than 40 years. Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday announced they would be raising interest rates half a percentage point as part of an ongoing effort to control inflation.

A separate Labor Department report Thursday showed that jobless claims increased to 200,000 for the week ended April 30, a 19,000 gain from the previous period and above the Dow Jones estimate for 182,000.

Continuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, fell 19,000 to 1.38 million, the lowest level since Jan. 17, 1970.

The productivity data reflect a quarter in which a variety of factors converged to cause a 1.4% decline in the rate of economic growth as measured by gross domestic product.

Rising Covid cases, runaway inflation and the Russian invasion of Ukraine dented activity, though most economists expect growth to resume later in the year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at his post-meeting news conference Wednesday that he still sees the U.S. in a strong position though inflation must be tamed if the recovery is to remain strong.",finance,1651769454

Global bond markets have suffered unprecedented losses since peaking last year, as central banks including the Federal Reserve look to tighten policy to combat surging inflation.

The Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, a benchmark for government and corporate debt total returns, has fallen 11% from a high in January 2021. That’s the biggest decline from a peak in data stretching back to 1990, surpassing a 10.8% drawdown during the financial crisis in 2008. It equates to a drop in the index market value of about $2.6 trillion, worse than about $2 trillion in 2008.
 

While there were signs the brutal selloff was easing on Wednesday, rising inflationary pressure around the world is fueling concerns about the ability of the global economy to weather any sustained period of higher financing costs. For investors, it means the allure of holding debt -- even safe government bonds -- is diminishing given how sensitive valuations are to interest rates, a measure referred to as duration.

“The safe haven attributes of Treasuries have been undermined when one adds duration risk to the equation,” said Winson Phoon, head of fixed income research at Maybank Securites Pte. Ltd. 

That’s a blow to money managers accustomed to years of consistent gains, backstopped by loose monetary policy. The slump also poses a particular threat to the expanding elderly population in many major economies, given retirees are often heavily reliant on fixed-income investments. 

The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points last week, and Chair Jerome Powell said this week it is prepared to increase them by a half percentage-point at its next meeting if needed. His hawkish tone prompted traders to rapidly ratchet up estimates for how aggressively the Fed will tighten monetary policy this year, with money markets pricing in the equivalent of seven more quarter-point hikes by the end of 2022.

“The headwinds for fixed income remain heavy,” said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore. “Investors will need to recalibrate return expectations and be nimble to exploit market dislocations.”

The yield on 10-year Treasuries slipped two basis points to 2.36% as of 6:28 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, after surging to the highest level since 2019. Spanish and Italian bonds led the advance in Europe, with their benchmark rates falling three basis points.

Credit Risk

Higher borrowing costs risk further damping the return on debt, eroded by the fastest pace of consumer-price increases in decades. Soaring commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could worsen the outlook. Corporate bonds are particularly vulnerable to mounting stagflation threats, as slowing economic growth also raises credit risks.

Companies in the U.S. and Europe are set to avoid defaults thanks to healthy balance sheets and a manageable debt maturity schedule, Amanda Lynam, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Still, she sees the euro-denominated market as slightly more exposed if geopolitical tensions stay elevated for longer.

Global equities, meanwhile, are nursing losses of about 6% this year, even as stocks have bounced back in recent days as more investors bet they will help hedge against inflation. The retreat in both fixed-income and stock markets in 2022 is upending the dynamics of a classic 60/40 portfolio that is meant to balance out any losses from riskier share markets with the more stable cash flow of bonds.

The meltdown in global debt markets is a reminder of the Fed’s tightening cycle in 2018, though the broad global bond index wound up losing only 1.2% for that full year. But unlike four years ago, price pressures are now much stronger and the global supply chain is beleaguered. 

For emerging Asia, the threat of stagnant growth and accelerating inflation adds to the upside risk for yields, according to Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. 

“We are likely to continue seeing upward pressure on yields as we expect monetary tightening in a number of Asian economies to start in” the second half of the year, said Jennifer Kusuma, a senior Asia rates strategist at the bank.

Data on the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index before 1999 is monthly rather than daily and the constituents and duration of aggregate indexes fluctuate. Fixed-income investors can still make money by betting against bonds.

CryptoMarkets,"After lots of Speculation, Anchor Protocol has officially launched floating interest rates","There have been speculations for a long time that Anchor Protocol, a borrowing and lending platform built on the Terra blockchain, would launch floating interest rates. This speculation has finally been achieved as the defi protocol, which gave 20% yields to all the users, had introduced floating interest rates to produce sustainable yields for its users. 
Colin Wu, a well-known crypto reporter, stated that compared to last week, the interest rate this week was 18%, down 1.5%. Reserves now total $209 million, a net outflow of about $30 million from last week.  
In a Twitter post, Anchor Protocol stated that As discussed in this last week’s semi-dynamic Earn rate AMA, the Earn rate will update today, May 1st, to exactly 18% APY @ 12pm EST. They also added; “The rate will update roughly every 388068 blocks or every month, but it may differ slightly MoM given that block times can change. Any MoM change over .25% in the yield reserve will trigger a rate change,”  
However, one of the benefits of this is that it is aimed at producing sustainable yields for users. In addition, these Defi protocols use yields as an introductory marketing strategy. 
Also, note that with this defi protocol, none of the yields is sustainable as they are partially paid via reserves from those projects. This is unlike projects like, AAVE, Theta, point network, etc as all of them are implementing a decentralized market which gives you access to higher interest rates and sustainable yields.",cryptocurrency,1651771757

With this simple thing in mind, say the interest rate hikes up and the buyer will not be able to afford the property. However, say it’s a fixed rate loan for the property so everything is okay. However, due to the pandemic and the closure of stores the landlord will not be able to afford if this is their only source of income.

gaming,SBMM is ruining my favorite gaming genre,"I grew up playing Halo 3, Classic CODs, Counter Strike, and Battlefield games. As the years have gone by there seems to be a shift towards free to play models and keeping below average players nice and safe and secure in below average tiers. The problem with this is now I'm in a bracket of ""good"" players, but at the absolute bottom of that tier. I just was curious if other people are dealing with this too. I think I'm a competent fps players, but I got on Halo last night and was in dead last my first few games. I was killed by someone using mouse and keyboard multiple times where in Halo I find it extra tragic that crossplay is forced on. Specifically with the battle rifle or commando if I miss a shot or get hit mid aim it feels like my ability to reposition the reticle back on the enemy player is like non existent compared to literally just dragging your hand a bit to adjust on mouse and keyboard. I've heard people argue in defense of Controller vs MnK but I think that only applies to the top tier players. Regular MnK players will always have a precision advantage and I felt it in real time as they would just effortlessly adjust to being shot at and still hit almost every shot. I just feel like shooters are actively burning a large portion of their player base to the ground and it will absolutely bite them in the ass as the years go on. How many people are really gonna buy the next COD or spend money on Micros in Halo when the games are perceived as ""sweaty"". Literally all of my friends have quit Halo and almost always refer to the sbmm as their biggest reason. They also blame the TTK but I don't think it'd be an issue if they were getting kills and hitting their shots. Just sucks that the casual multiplayer fps fan is just being fed to high skilled players/streamers for insane 20 kill games for them while we have the worst fps gaming experience I've felt in years. I do think players on average are just getting better too, but the rise of smurfing and shit like that is absolutely a result of the hyper aggressive sbmm. Just sad to me cause I love fps gaming, but I think I'm done. I've been playing PVE co-op games like Returnal now and Elden Ring so it's not that I don't like a challenge, it's just the challenge feels insurmountable and overall completely unfun. To fire up Halo for the first time in like 4 months and have your cheeks absolutely clapped up is a fucking tragedy that the devs really need to take seriously. I played three games and uninstalled.

Bitcoin,Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates By 0.5% For First Time In More Than 2 Decades,"Yesterday the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.50% and the cryptocurrency market also brought a huge impact. Every time the interest rates are raised cryptocurrencies face the risk of selling off, a large amount of money flows from the crypto circle to sound investments and the rate hike means that excess liquidity is being extracted from the financial markets. The support for crypto asset markets is weakened, creating more uncertainty.  
If the Fed continues to follow its plan and execute seven consecutive sub-rate hikes, the impact on cryptocurrencies will be huge. Although bitcoin did not open a downward channel in the face of this Fed rate hike announcement, crypto assets have opened a downward mode as early as the end of last year when the Fed announced that it would begin to scale back its bond purchases and hinted at rising interest rates. With the Fed raising rates, bitcoin will likely continue to trade in a price range this year without a significant increase.

Bitcoin,Interest Rates and Price Drop,"After going through the subreddit people aren't picking up the most important detail: the rising United States Bank of the Federal Reserve Federal Funds Interest rate.

The Federal Funds rate will rises from 0.25-0.5% to 0.75-1.00%.

I believe that this is the interest rate that banks will charge one another.  The rising interest rate will fight inflation and remove excess liquidity in the financial system that goes to things like risk assets including bitcoin.  It will also make it very difficult for the Federal Government to borrow money.  Deficit spending will continue as usual as there have not been any announcements to reduce it.  Within two years (probably sooner) the Federal Government will have so much difficulty borrowing money that the Federal Reserve will need to print more money.  That will bring back the price of bitcoin far above what it is now.

personalfinance,Treasury Series I Bonds FAQ,"There's been a lot of posts recently about I Bonds and I've seen a lot of the same questions asked in the comments.  Rather than try to answer them all individually, I thought I'd make this post.

I'll edit the post and add any new questions or tips that are commented here, or any corrections to my answers.

# What are I Bonds?

I Bonds are savings bonds issued by the federal government with a variable interest rate that changes every 6 months, depending on the current inflation rate (there is also a fixed portion of the rate that's tied to the federal reserve key interest rates.  This has been 0% for a while, but that may change soon)  Unlike other bonds, savings bonds can't be bought and sold on the open market (those are known as marketable securities), and so the value of the bond is always equal to the face value plus accrued interest.  The minimum purchase amount is 25$ and they can be held for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 30 years.  They are available to US citizens and permanent residents with a SS number.

# How can I purchase I Bonds?

You can only purchase I bonds by making an account on the treasury direct website: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res\_ibonds.htm](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm)

# What's so good about them?

They are currently paying a guaranteed 9.62% interest and are backed by the United States Government.  Any other investment that offers a **risk free** return even close to that right now is a scam.  The current highest savings account rates are 0.7% and CDs around 2%.  If rates and inflation continue to go up then the I Bond rates will continue to go up.  If we ever get into a deflationary environment (seems unlikely now but it's possible one day) another benefit is that they are guaranteed to never go below 0% rate.

They are exempt from state income tax.  Federal income tax is deferred until they are redeemed so they can compound and grow tax free (sort of like the benefit of a traditional IRA minus the actual contribution deduction).  You could choose to pay the tax liability annually if you think that would be more beneficial, but once you elect to do that you must continue to do so for all existing and future I bonds that you own.  If used for educational expenses for yourself, spouse, or a dependent then the interest is exempt from federal taxes.

# What's the catch?

You MUST hold them for a minimum of 1 year from the issue date.

You can only purchase a maximum of $10,000 per person per year.  (Technically $15,000, but see the pro tips)

If you redeem them in less than 5 years you will forfeit the previous 3 months of interest as a penalty.

The interest rate changes every 6 months, based on the current inflation rate.

# Should I purchase I Bonds?

Only you can make that decision, but for most people with extra money sitting in a bank account that they won't need for at least a year the answer right now is most probably yes.  Even if you plan to hold less than 5 years and will forfeit the penalty, they are still a great deal.  That answer can change in the future, but after 1 year you can redeem any I bonds you hold at any time.  Hint: When the government caps how much you can contribute to something it usually means it's a pretty good deal (think IRA\\401k\\HSA contributions).

# Can I purchase I Bonds for someone else?

Yes, you can purchase gift I Bonds for anyone who meets the criteria to purchase themselves.  You can gift up to $10,000 per gift recipient per year.  The recipient does not need a treasury direct account until you actually deliver the gift.  The gift can sit in your account until then and will accrue interest the entire time.

# When does the interest rate change?

The rate changes every 6 months, in May and November.  Regardless of what month you purchase, whatever the rate is when you buy them will be fixed for 6 months and then you'll get the next rate for 6 months and so on.  For example if you purchase in July, you will get the rate that was announced in May for the next 6 months, and then in January you'll get the rate that was announced in November and so on.

# I purchased my bonds X months ago, why doesn't the value reflect the interest?

Because there is a 3 month penalty if held less than 5 years, the treasury direct site shows the current value of the bond without the previous 3 months of interest, until the bond is 5 years old. Example, if you purchase a bond in May, your May's interest will post on June 1, but you won't see that first interest on that bond until September 1, and it will be the interest accrued in May.

# Pro Tips:

**Reduce the penalty and minimum holding period:**

I Bond issue date and the start of interest accruing is always the first day of the month they are purchased.  Time your purchase for the end of the month (don't want the exact last day to allow time for transfers) and you will effectively reduce the minimum holding period by 1 month. This will also effectively reduce your 3 month penalty by 1 month if you hold for less than 5 years, and give you a 1 month bonus if you hold for more than 5 years.

**Purchase more than $10,000 per year:**

You can purchase up to $5,000 in additional paper I bonds per year via your tax return, making the total yearly purchase limit $15,000.  You could purposely over withhold your taxes to accomplish this.  See the following comment for some tricks regarding this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/uj564u/comment/i7hsnhb/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/uj564u/comment/i7hsnhb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Read more about it on the treasury direct site.

**Purchase more than $15,000 per year:**

You could purchase $15,000 for yourself this year, and then purchase $10,000 as a gift for someone, like a spouse or relative this year.  They could also do the same for you.  Then in a later year you would transfer the gifts, but they would have been accruing interest the whole time.  The catch is that the year you transfer will count towards the recipients $10,000 purchase limit that year, but it still makes sense to do this in high inflation years, and then save the transfers for low inflation years.

**Know what your interest rate will be for a full year:**

There is a small window at the end of every April and October where you'll know what the next rate will be, and of course know what the current rate will be.  If you time your purchases for these periods it will give you a more informed decision of if and how much to purchase.  You can average the current rate and next rate get your effective yearly rate for the next 12 months, which is also the minimum holding period.

# How are I bonds taxed?

I Bond interest is taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gains.

I Bonds are exempt from state income taxes. If used for qualified educational expenses (same requirement for 529 accounts) for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent then they are exempt from federal income tax.

When you redeem an I Bond, you will get a 1099-INT at the end of the year just like you would from a bank account, and you'll file that in your tax return for the year they were redeemed. You only owe taxes on the interest that you gained, not the total value of the bond. All of the interest earned over all of the years you held the bond is added to your income for the year they were redeemed.

You can choose to report the interest yearly if you feel that would be more beneficial to you, but once you start doing that you must do so for all current and all future I Bonds that you own. When you redeem the bonds you'll fill out an extra form with that years tax returns indicating you've already reported these in prior years.

# Who can purchase I Bonds?

* United States citizen, whether you live in the U.S. or abroad
* United States resident
* Civilian employee of the United States, no matter where you live

# How can I purchase I Bonds?

You can not hold I Bonds in an IRA/retirement account or any other type of account.

# What's so good about them?

The interest rate changes every 6 months, based on the current inflation rate.

Most people don't run into issues using the very outdated Treasury Direct website, but if you do run into an issue verifying your identity, switching bank accounts, or getting locked out there are some reports of very excessive wait times when calling to speak to someone.

# Should I purchase I Bonds?

Only you can make that decision, but for most people with extra money sitting in a bank account that they won't need for at least a year the answer right now is probably yes. Even if you plan to hold less than 5 years and will forfeit the penalty, they are still a great deal.

Hint: When the government caps how much you can contribute to something it usually means it's a pretty good deal (think IRA\\401k\\HSA contributions).

# Can I purchase I Bonds for someone else?

Yes, you can purchase gift I Bonds for anyone who meets the criteria to purchase themselves. You can gift up to $10,000 per gift recipient per year. The recipient does not need a treasury direct account until you actually deliver the gift. The gift can sit in your account until then and will accrue interest the entire time.

# When does the interest rate change?

The rate changes every 6 months, in May and November. Regardless of what month you purchase, whatever the rate is when you buy them will be fixed for 6 months and then you'll get the next rate for 6 months and so on. For example if you purchase in July, you will get the rate that was announced in May for the next 6 months, and then in January you'll get the rate that was announced in November and so on.

# I purchased my bonds X months ago, why doesn't the value reflect the interest?

Because there is a 3 month penalty if held less than 5 years, the treasury direct site shows the current value of the bond without the previous 3 months of interest, until the bond is 5 years old.  Example, if you purchase a bond in May, your May's interest will post on June 1, but you won't see that first interest on that bond until September 1, and it will be the interest accrued in May.

# How are I bonds taxed?

I Bond interest is taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gains.

I Bonds are exempt from state income taxes. If used for qualified educational expenses (same requirement for 529 accounts) for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent then they are exempt from federal income tax.

When you redeem an I Bond, you will get a 1099-INT at the end of the year just like you would from a bank account, and you'll file that in your tax return for the year they were redeemed.  You only owe taxes on the interest that you gained, not the total value of the bond.  All of the interest earned over all of the years you held the bond is added to your income for the year they were redeemed.

You can choose to report the interest yearly if you feel that would be more beneficial to you, but once you start doing that you must do so for all current and all future I Bonds that you own.  When you redeem the bonds you'll fill out an extra form with that years tax returns indicating you've already reported these in prior years.

# Pro Tips:

**Reduce the penalty and minimum holding period:**

I Bond issue dates and the start of interest accruing is always the first day of the month they are purchased.  Time your purchase for the end of the month (don't want the exact last day to allow time for transfers) and you will effectively reduce the minimum holding period by 1 month. This will also effectively reduce your 3 month penalty by 1 month if you hold for less than 5 years, and give you a 1 month bonus if you hold for more than 5 years.

**Purchase more than $10,000 per year:**

You can purchase up to $5,000 in additional paper I bonds per year via your income tax refund, making the total yearly purchase limit $15,000. You could purposely over withhold your taxes to accomplish this. You could also file an extension and overpay by $5,000 to generate a refund.  It requires you to fill out one extra form directing how your refund should be paid (Form 8888). Note: these are actual paper bonds and they will not show up in your treasury direct account.

**Purchase more than $15,000 per year:**

You could purchase $15,000 for yourself this year, and then purchase $10,000 as a gift for someone, like a spouse or relative this year. They could also do the same for you. Then in a later year you would transfer the gifts, but they would have been accruing interest the whole time. The catch is that the year you transfer will count towards the recipient's $10,000 purchase limit that year, but it still makes sense to do this in high inflation years, and then save the transfers for low inflation years.

**Know what your interest rate will be for a full year:**

There is a small window at the end of every April and October where you'll know what the next rate will be, and of course know what the current rate will be. If you time your purchases for these periods it will give you a more informed decision on if you want to buy them. You can average the current rate and next rate to get your effective rate for the next 12 months, which is also the minimum holding period.",finance,1651779426

stocks,Putting Cramer on the record: He thinks inflation is peaking,"[Cramer is making two major points](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/investing-club-were-not-panicking-cramer-sees-inflation-peaking-looks-for-stock-buys.html). Wanted to take everyone's opinion on this.

First point is that today's sell off is caused by 10 year yield rising above 3%, which triggered algorithms to start selling stocks.

&gt;Bond investors are likely selling their holdings, Cramer suggested, because they believe Powell was wrong to say the Fed is “not actively considering” a 75 basis point hike while the economy faces its hottest bout of inflation since the early 1980s. The bond market moves are, in turn, triggering stock sales by algorithmic traders, Cramer said.

I'm not quite sure what Cramer is saying here. Is he saying that bond holders don't believe Powell will restrict himself from doing a 75 basis raise? Or is he saying that bond holders think 50 basis raises won't be enough and inflation will kill the bond prices in the future?

Second point is probably a controversial prediction: Cramer believes inflation is peaking, and that in 3 months things will look very different. He lists as examples (some of this is not covered in the article but I heard him say this on TV):

* Cooper and aluminum prices dropping.
* Good rain in US benefiting Soy Beans and also wheat prices going down.
* Car prices new and old coming down.
* Mortgage rate will cool demand.
* The only thing that will not go down is oil.

I know how people feel about Cramer, but if possible would like to hear your take on this based on substance and not just ""lol Cramer sucks."" I'm not saying he doesn't suck, it's just that regardless of who the messenger is, these are just starting points for discussion so let's just stipulate that yes you hate him but let's dissect his points. Bash Cramer's take for being dumb but please explain why to educate the rest of us thank you.",finance,1651785762

personalfinance,Young and lost. Is it better to go more into debt to reduce monthly payments?,"Hello,

I wanted to ask for financial advice here because I feel lost and I don’t have anyone to turn to. I will give a brief explanation of our finances and the dilemmas.

We have bought a home that is a bit further away from where I work recently. (It is under construction but should be finished soon so no payments have started and I can only assume some costs) And I feel that now I will have to spend exorbitant money on fuel.

It is around 1600KM (1000 miles) of driving monthly for my work (5 times a week for 4 weeks) and our car uses on average 6 litres of diesel (current price being 2,14 $ / L) And that ends up being around 100 litres for a month so 214$. This is a pretty big hit and we have been considering getting an electric car to lower costs significantly.

Now we pay 270$ for a car loan (3500$ left) and insurance combined(I can lower insurance by not taking windshield insurance by around 40$). With fuel it is around 500$/mo. An electric car would be around 435$ (would be newer by around 25 000 miles) A cheaper electric car is also an option, but I am range anxious.

The problem is we would be getting into another loan with a floating interest rate (it would be around 6-7%) but our house loan would have a locked rate for 5 years.

We are also expecting a baby within the next few days.

My feelings are very mixed, there is a lot of uncertainty now with our bills, I don’t know what our costs will be \*\*exactly\*\*. I have done calculations that put us well into saving 1/5th of our income at the end of the month, that is with fuel costs and a layer of 300+ / - just in case. I have talked this over with my wifes father and he is leaning against getting into a car loan as he has lived trough the crash in 2008 and is worried for the future with the inflation and our government raising interest by 1% this month to try to curb an inflation of 7%. As that would probably keep going up.

So my question is, do we go into more debt (20 000$) and offset the costs of a diesel and long travel, or do we stick to a car that costs more in the end but we are not burdened.

We are 24 and 27 expecting our first child, both have good health insurance and I have a very safe job.

Thank you for any and all advice (life and financial), all prices here are my regional prices (Iceland) and I have converted everything to dollars and miles to make it more understandable.",finance,1651786002

Something I notice as I was going through this is institutional investing groups were in this far longer than what we thought. The price jumps near at midnight and not when the news hits when there is a rate hike. And what you will find is a strong similar push in similar directions in the stock market.

Anyways, the data is saying to me that rate cuts don't do much of anything. But rate hikes it tends to jump and the following day/s it will flat line or drop. Similar to what we seen today.

personalfinance,Game plan to help pay for kids' college,"Background:  I'm an early 50s divorced male with two kids that will both be off to university late this summer.  There are no savings specifically earmarked for our kids' education and all of our assets were divided equally in our divorce a few years ago.  Here's my current financial scenario:

*I own a home worth $2 million with about $285k left on my 3.125% 30-year mortgage.  My monthly mortage payments are about $1,300/month.

*I have about $180k in my Schwab retirement account allocated mostly to target date 2035 index funds (SWYFX).

*I own my car and have no other debt other than normal monthly expenses.

*After paying taxes last month I have about $20k remaining in cash in a bank money market account that is there to cover monthly expenses and serve as an emergency fund.

*I started my own LLC a year ago and make around $100k per year.  My first client is having significant supply issues so my contract with them is extremely unstable right now.  I updated my resume today and am going to begin looking for new client(s) immediately.

*I realize that I am not well-positioned for a normal retirement horizon right now and that I'll likely have to sell my home at some point to be able to do that.  I live in a metro area where real estate is absolutely insane, so I view my home equity as my eventual retirement, not the modest about I have in my IRAs.  I live well within my means, haven't been on a real vacation in many years, drive a 2011 Chevy with low miles, shop frugally, dine out rarely, etc.  I am very happy with what I currently have and my home is my happy place.

My ex and I have met with the financial teams at each of the universities that our boys will be attending.  Both will be taking the maximum federal student loan amounts of $5,500 and we have enough GET units to mostly cover each of their first semesters.  My parents are going to be kicking in $2k each which I will deposit into bank accounts that I will establish for each boy and will use this money for payments to the schools.  Beyond that it looks like there is a gap of approximately $5,000/month over the college months total between the two, so we're going to have to come up with a game plan to close this gap.

Assuming a 50/50 split of this burden between my ex and me, and also assuming that I accept this burden, that's $2,500/month that I will be on the hook for, and I don't have that kind of pad in my earnings.  The Parent Plus loan is one option, and I've also begun brainstorming others such as a private loan, line of credit, or HELOC.  Given the interest rate on my mortgage compared to current market I'm guessing that a cash-out re-fi isn't going to be an attractive option for me.  Though we likely won't be having to make any significant payments until the first of next year (as a result of our GET units), I'm motivated to begin making decisions on this now as a result of my LLC client being very unstable.  If a worst-case scenario happens and my client doesn't renew my contract with me and I have difficulty finding a new client I don't want any lending institution refusing my loan request as a result.

So I'm trying to decide what to do here and am experiencing a lot of anxiety about this.  I knew college was going to be expensive but I didn't anticipate this much of gap between their federal student loans  and overall total cost.  I would be very appreciative of any advice given to me for the best game plan to move forward.

TL;DR:  Looking for the best way to take on debt to help fund my kids' college education.  **Selling my home is not an option I am currently considering.**",finance,1651789318

Currently, the 2021 4xe I own is worth more than I even purchased it for. I refinanced the one I bought through someone with a lower interest rate. 

My question is how would this work if I wanted to make this trade? What's my first step? Would I let them finance through whoever they use or should I call my current finance company and tell them the issue? I'm at a loss where to start. 

Let's say I owe $42k currently on the 2021 4xe but it's worth ~$56k. I'm wanting to trade it in for a 2022 V6 which is worth $52k.

Bitcoin,Thoughts on the market-- FUD,"I thought I would share my observations on the market right now.  I mostly trade in crypto although I do hold some stocks.

The Market is a dumpster fire.  The dollar is decoupling from oil and the federal reserve lacks the political will power to raise interest rates to curtail stagnation.   The rally yesterday after the news of the limited rate hike, was indicative of how corrupt and broken the system is.  There is circular flow of capital, that is big players buying the dips and selling the rallys.  This is an acquisition of market assets by a few institutions (vanguard, blackrock).  The casino is rig fokes and it is akin to Plato's Cave allegory.  One in which people are chained to a chair and forced to stare at shadows cast on the wall in front of them.  The individuals who rise to promentance are the best bullshiters, who are able to forecast what shadows might appear next.

That is the stock market in a nutshell, shadows and rigged statistics and false earnings reports to cover up the monstrous debt that everyone is in.  In reality it is worse, because instead of shadows randomly cast by torch bearers in the background, certain players are privy to macro economic realities prior to market opens.   Making it inevitable that bad actors game the system.  Creating false rallies that retail investors FOMO in on and then are left holding the bag after the inevitable pull back.

Bitcoin.  The whole crypto space is down as Bitcoin is down.  The crypto market is really a speculative ecosystem that exists in Bitcoin’s shadow.  Bitcoin price action directly correlates with the major stock indexes.  If stocks dip, Bitcoin follows suit.   The reasoning for this is simple; stock investors dabble in the crypto space.  A lot of the activity in the crypto space is driven by the same players.  The same strategies of pump and dump, buying the dips, selling the rallies apply.  Furthermore, Bitcoin and the crypto market are dumping because investors are selling off to make margin.  Simply, the crypto space is being sold off to cover the losses in the stock market.  Bitcoin could easily go down to 25k, or even 10k.   Considering how much capital institutions and governments have started to put into Bitcoin.  If the economy continues to slide and the market continues to tumble, institutions will sell off their more risky assets to cover their liquidation and margin calls.

But once this is done and the market bottom is in.  Bitcoin will not only recover, it will do so quickly.  It will decouple from the nasdaq and tech indexes.  And hopefully take its place as a global reserve currency/asset/property.  Free of censorship, inflation and centralization.  Silver and gold are also on a collision course.   Silver needs to come up, constitutional (junk) silver is trading at a 40 percent premium.   It's crazy.   The paper gold and silver from comex is over leveraged and over sold.  There's not enough physical silver to cover the demand, let alone the obligations of the futures contracts.   That being said, silver investors have been saying the same thing for the last 15 years.

In short, the sky is falling, the commercial re-estate bubble is collapsing, the dollar is losing its value, and the banks lack the political will power to raise interest rates.  The president of the United States seems to be compromised by international business interests.  Whom, are taking this opportunity to consolidate their control over the global economy.

stocks,"Hot take: people don't want to admit ""I don't know"".","Throw all of it out.  The notion that ""stocks always go up"" is not true.  There's no rule written into the fabric of the Universe that says that.  Historically, yes, stocks have gone up.  Just look, we've had three major crises in the last 20 years (dotcom bubble, Global Financial Crisis, and Covid), and stocks have promptly recovered, right?  But I ask you: whatever could be the secret sauce that made such a miraculous recovery possible?  Do you have any notion?  I encourage you to look up ""Quantitative easing"".

And just because something looks beautiful on the surface, does it mean that deep down it's healthy or sustainable?  Marilyn Monroe for example.  Beautiful woman, a worldwide icon.  But miserable inside.  Or all these stupid Instagram models and social media folk.  Just because they look beautiful on social media doesn't mean their lives are actually that magical.  And yeah, the drug addict who gets his hit of heroin feels like he's on cloud 9.  But it's not real.

This is what has happened thanks to monetary policy over the last two decades plus.  Stocks have done well, but has the economy?  The Fed's easing of liquidity after the dotcom bubble was identified as one major cause of the early 2000s real estate bubble.  And the world still has not fully recovered from the damage done in 2008.  The Fed could only manage to engage in quantitative tightening for less than a year before the markets had a hissy fit and they had to implement QE again.  And this was all before Covid, which scarred our economy even more.

We've been kicking the can down the road.  All you have to do is look at [historical interest rates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS) and it's clear that we're running out of room to operate.  Don't forget, too, that inflation is the highest it's been in 30 years.

So the notion that ""stocks have always gone up, even in the midst of crises"" ignores the very key element of monetary policy.  It also ignores the fact that in some places, like Japan, stocks *don't* always go up.  The Nikkei still hasn't recovered its 1989 highs, over 30 years later (that bubble was also fueled by a market pumped with liquidity).

I'd really encourage everyone to examine if the notion that ""no matter what, stocks go up"" is as categorically true as a statement like ""2 + 2 = 4"".  It's clear that it's not.  So I encourage people to be a little more honest.

I believe there's a psychological element to all of this, and people want to believe that everything is going to work out no matter what.  Just buy VTI and chill, right? But even that is no guarantee, especially when you buy at bubble valuations.  But it's not comfortable to admit that, hey, this whole thing is very, very fucking uncertain.  I wasn't paying attention from 2000-2008, I was a bit too young, but I've read a lot about it.  From what I gather people were really sure that ""real estate always goes up"", because it always had.  And then complete disaster struck.  Very few people expected it, and those who predicted it were ignored, scorned, or even mocked.  And look at Covid.  Who could have expected Covid?  Yet this is the nature of life.  These things happen.

I'm not one of those people who says ""nobody knows shit, bears or bulls"".  That's not the point of this post.  I'm also not encouraging anyone to sell all their positions.  But what I am encouraging people to do is to be a little more honest about the risks, and to make prudent decisions going forward that take into account the possibility that things aren't going to be all sunshine and roses.  You may sacrifice potential upside if things do end up working out, but you will also save yourself a lot of trouble if shit does hit the fan.  One thing I've learned from life is that shit can and will hit the fan... life is so fragile.

Unfortunately, the POWcycle that just ended was the severest yet. I'm not going to offer any further analysis here, only advice:  


* **Don't sell for a loss!** The institutional algos are working nonstop to trick us. Don't sell or you'll permanently delete capital at a loss. I know how hard it is, emotionally, but you've got to hang on. Don't let them steal your money!
* **For positions in the green, avoid holding long shares or bullish options positions (especially shorted puts) on growth stocks through earnings.** We've seen some devastating collapses on the slightest misses at earnings calls, such as DOCN and NET. It's not worth taking the risk to hold through earnings. Overall, the odds are against us. (Some stocks have dropped even after beating EPS and revenue expectations as the result of guidance concerns and severely negative sentiment.)
* **Don't make any bullish bets on growth stocks yet.** It's better to be late and safe rather than early and sorry. Anecdotal observations by Americans in China suggest that the virus is spreading far more than the Chinese government is letting on. This is impacting both factory production and shipping. No one knows how bad it will get, or how soon, but just in case, it's better to be patient and cautious over the coming months. Additionally, the unpredictable war against Ukraine, wild volatility, and economic data that shows that the inflationary situation is far worse than The JPow is telling us should make us very cautious. 
* **Be careful about chasing oil and other commodities in the green.** Share prices have run up drastically, and retail traders usually wind up chasing and buying them at the top. Oil and natural gas prices are very volatile, and any diplomatic breakthrough in the war against Ukraine would cause oil prices to immediately fall off of a cliff. 
* **Avoid shorting puts.** Some institutional algos are cleverly programmed to create volatility to exploit retail trading data that the institutions pay a lot of money for and trigger margin calls in the options market. No matter how green the market might be on any particular day, remember that the economic picture is deteriorating as we head for a recession.
* **Don't try to hedge, because it's too late at this point.** Buying puts or shorting shares is dangerous because of the possibility of a relief rally, the timing of which is unpredictable and could do even more damage to your portfolio. In these conditions, the best thing that retail investors and traders can do is nothing at all.
* **Don't blindly trust The JPow.** Many of us watched him at his press conference yesterday, Wed 4 May, after the FOMC meeting concluded. He made it sound as if the economy was in pretty good shape and that the labor market was still strong. When he calmly and reassuringly announced that the Fed isn't considering hiking rates by +0.75%, retail traders went crazy with buying what they thought was the dip, but the institutional algos knew better and only too happily sold into strength.   Then, today, share prices collapsed and the market bled like Gettysburg. Instead of trusting The JPow's statements, study the data and make up your own mind. One good website for this is [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/indicators). 
* **Don't be fooled by relief rallies.** Institutional algos know that retail investors focus on daily price action and lack the context that institutions have, thanks to their sophisticated econometric   
models. While retail traders buy on what they think is a sustainable rally, the algos sell into temporary strength. When retail traders get scared and panic-sell, algos buy for a steep discount.
* **Save money from other sources and wait for the right opportunity.** Market conditions are creating generational buying opportunities on growth stocks. Despite inflation, a large cash position will become extremely valuable later this year. 
* **If you don't have a job right now and are looking for one, try hard to speed the process along.** I believe that the coming recession will make finding a job much more difficult, and it will also lead to job losses as consumers stop spending money, corporate revenue drops, and capital spending drops. The JPow said that the availability of jobs is very high relative to demand. But he didn't say that most of those jobs aren't jobs that anyone would actually want. 
* **Please ask for help if you need it.** During previous market crashes, [the suicide rate increased](https://www.open.ac.uk/research/news/stock-market-crashes-linked-higher-rates-suicide) and lasted for a year afterward. This is a horrible tragedy, but for every one of these suicides, there are countless people who become depressed and spiral downward. Whatever you do, don't isolate from other people. Get support. Nothing is as bad as it seems, and in the stock and options markets, nothing is permanent—even the worst news.

Right now, our goal needs to be to preserve as much capital as possible. The probability of making money in these conditions is low. If you can hold on, the best of the growth stocks that you own that have dropped 50% to 90% will reverse powerfully. Even if it takes years of waiting, it will be worth it. 

Please remember that the POWcycles haven't stopped. I urge anyone who hasn't read my previous messages to do so, and make decisions based on hard economic and stock-specific financial data. 

Hang in there, guys. I know how hard this is. It affects all of us. 

We're going to eventually climb out of it together!

stocks,How long do you all believe this downturn will last,"Appreciate this community. Nice to see I'm not alone in losing thousands and thousands of dollars in a span of a few weeks.

I know this board is full of investors and traders of all levels, but I want some honest real opinions, ideally from more informed members here, how long do you really believe this ""bear"" market or whatever this is...will last.

I'll be honest, I work at a very big retail business (be it a commodity), owned by one of the larger FAANG stocks and I will tell you, you would never ever know we were in a recession or being close to one. There has never been so much excessive wealth in history (correct me i'f I'm wrong here) and clearly, technology (growth companies) where most of these people are making their fortunes are not just gonna die away, because clearly, seems like we are at the point of no return, like it or not as far as counting on tech, so I just can't really see this ""stagnation"" happening as long as in the past?

And I know at the end of the day, know one really knows, except possible the Fed and the very small percentage of entities who basically control us all in the end.

Background on myself: in my late forties, live very minimalist, don't need much to live and my expenses are low, and trying not to be worrying about my portfolio in the next 5 years, possibly/hopefully mostly be out of this market and living off what I have. 60% of my savings in the market, was slightly in the green 3-4% yesterday for the first time, then down like 5% today. 

Technically, I am trying to look at my portfolio as a whole vs individual gains and losses these days. I am starting to feel, the next time I'm in the green, just sell everything and chill for awhile. Any advice on this option would also be appreciated.

Thanks.",finance,1651794521

stocks,Former Fed Vice Chairman: Need to raise interest rates to 3.5% to slow inflation. Will the stock market continue to rise?,"Former Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the Fed would need to raise short-term interest rates to at least 3.5% to rein in soaring inflation. ""A rapid 'raise to neutral' in interest rates in this economic cycle is not enough to bring inflation back to the long-term target of 2% at the expected level,"" he said. ""I think the funds rate will eventually need to be raised to a tight range,"" he said. At least one percentage point above the nominal neutral rate of 2.5%.""

The Fed on Wednesday raised its target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 0.5%-0.75%, and said it was likely to continue raising rates. It also announced a plan to shrink its massive balance sheet starting next month.

Clarida, who left the Fed in January, said his former colleague might not have to raise rates as he suggested if the shrinking balance sheet had a much bigger impact on financial conditions than currently envisaged.

The Fed will begin reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by a total of $47.5 billion a month starting June 1, and a further $95 billion in three months.

Conversely, policymakers may have to raise interest rates further if inflation does not fall as much as they expect, Clarida noted.",finance,1651799066

I spoke with my accountant and he said a revised return is needed. He does charge for it and think it may be simple enough for me to do.

Does any one have experience with this and can comment on the process? Is it simply a matter of submitted a revised 1040 return with my wife's 8606 form? The same would apply to my NYS return?

personalfinance,Build a pool or buy a house with a pool?,"Hopefully this doesn't break any rules, I don't think it does.

Here's the nitty gritty.

We are in a home that we currently owe 240k on. Realtor just gave us an estimate of around 480k. We're in a 20 year fixed with a 2.3% interest rate. Our payment is $1776. Very affordable for our us. (We take home about 10k a month)

I want a pool. We live in Yuma and my kids do nothing but look at screens all summer because it's too hot to do anything else. We used to be in a rental with a pool and I really miss it. 

Just looked at a house in our neighborhood that has the backyard of my dreams. It has a pool with a waterfall and rock slide. It has a fire pit and built in bbq. It's gorgeous.

Other than the backyard the house isn't much different as far as sq ft. It's slightly bigger but same number of bathrooms/bedrooms. This house is listed at 567k.

Would you sell and move to a house with the yard you want?

Do some kind of HELOC and make the current house have the backyard you want? (Construction costs are so high the comp for the pool I want is 80k, plus the other stuff would be about 20k more). 

Or sell and move into the house with the yard ready made?

A few other points... We currently live on a really busy street. Didn't realize how busy when we bought it, because it's mostly people cutting through to avoid the light on the main street. People fly through the neighborhood so I never let my kids play out front. This new house is in a cul-de-sac, and has no neighbors to the back. It backs up to a field. I like that this is a much quieter street.

investing,Stagflation ETF Launches as Fed Attempts to Tame Sky-High Prices,"Quoting article from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-04/stagflation-etf-launches-as-fed-attempts-to-tame-sky-high-prices) ([non-paywall link here](https://archive.ph/4XBbP))

&gt;Traders worried about the Federal Reserve’s ability to tamp down ultra-hot inflation without sacrificing economic growth now have an exchange-traded fund to fall back on.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Merk Stagflation ETF (ticker [STGF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/STGF)) tracks a portfolio divided between 55%-85% U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and between 5%-15% real estate, gold and oil. The ETF charges a 0.45% expense ratio and will rebalance as needed to keep those weightings.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trading in STGF kicks off hours before the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points -- the biggest move since 2000 -- with at least two more supersized hikes priced in this year. While the hottest inflation prints in four decades fueled the Fed’s hawkish pivot, it’s a difficult needle to thread as the pace of growth cools and recession warnings ring louder. That’s fanned fears about stagflation -- a toxic mix of rising costs, falling employment and slow growth -- though the labor market remains hot and the American consumer has been resilient.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the launch is well-timed, ETF Think Tank’s Cinthia Murphy questioned why it doesn’t have a higher weighting to commodities.  
&gt;  
&gt;“As a general thought, the idea of a stagflation ETF is cool -- it’s first of a kind and it offers advisors and investors the ability to access four different assets they might not own otherwise in one single wrapper,” said Murphy, director of research at ETF Think Tank. “I find it somewhat surprising that this ETF would not have a broader allocation to commodities.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP), which STGF holds for TIPS exposure, has declined roughly 7.6% so far in 2022 even as price pressures surge. That’s outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s more than 12% drop and the 20% plunge in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), but that lags other inflation-hedging strategies.  
&gt;  
&gt;But while there is interest-rate risk, TIPS still are the “most direct instrument to help keep up with inflation over time,” according to STGF portfolio manager Axel Merk.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There are of course other choices one could have made,” Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments, wrote in an email. “Our goal is to provide a focused tool for investors to have in their tool-kit as they navigate what may be a stagflationary environment. Our goal was not to provide a kitchen sink.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But if the U.S. truly enters a stagflationary period, there won’t be any investing opportunities, Christopher Ailman of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. Though such an environment is still a low risk, it’s one worth watching as wages rise and supply chains remain clogged.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m not going to say the word stagflation,” Ailman, chief investment officer of second-largest U.S. pension fund, said in an interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference. “It’s still a low risk, but it’s got to be in the vocabulary for next year. There is nothing you can invest in, there is no opportunity when you’re in a stagflation environment.”",finance,1651812215

stocks,Google Fails to Beat Netlist Suit Over Memory Server Patents,"""Netlist Inc. can pursue allegations that Google Inc. memory servers infringe its patented memory module technology, a California federal judge ruled, sending Netlist shares soaring.

Google argued its allegedly infringing memory servers are insulated from infringement claims after Netlist amended parts of the patent during proceedings at the U.S. patent office. Judge Richard Seeborg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said one of the patent’s claims isn’t subject to that defense.

The ruling jump-starts a case that dates to 2009. Google said in previous court filings that if Netlist were allowed to pursue infringement of that patent claim, the patent office proceedings “will be rendered meaningless,” and the case will start over with respect to that patent claim.

Netlist shares rose 31% after the ruling. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.

investing,What are the direct and indirect effects of raising rates on the stock market?,"So as far as I remember, raising rates means that the Fed raises the rates of borrowing money to the banks and in turn, the banks raises the rates to its customers.

It mean that everyone that had a debt would have to pay a little bit more. Let's say 0.5% more.

CryptoCurrency,Staking on hardware wallets,"I have some questions. There are multiple PoS chains you can stake on. There are validators you can delegate your coins to, while keeping them in your wallet.

I'm not really sure how this delegation works, technically. Anybody got an easy explanation? Is it simply a feature on the blockchain of each wallet, like: Wallet 0x123456789ABCDEF has delegated 10 COIN to 0xFEDCBA9876543210 for staking, these assets are locked for X days and cannot be transferred, with wallet 0x123456789ABCDEF being the only one to be able to change that delegation? 

Software wallets like Exodus have really simple interfaces for that. Obviously, they are doing this delegation, however it works.

I've read somewhere that cold wallets cannot be used for staking. If it was a blockchain feature, I see no reason for that. An Exodus user's devices won't be online 24/7 either, and I really see no difference between Exodus on a laptop which is offline and a hardware wallet, from a staking point of view.

Exodus has some integration with Trezor, but apparently it doesn't really work for staking? 

Ledger has its own app that can be used with their devices and they claim to support staking, too.

Can you stake on cold wallets? 

And consider the coldest wallet of all:  You stake (delegate), then you delete your private keys from ALL your devices, burn the devices, just keep a copy of your recovery phrase in your head. You do nothing for two years, then you recover your wallet with your recovery phrase. Have your assets been staked the entire time?",cryptocurrency,1651842820

personalfinance,Tax write off for buying mortgage points?,"Hey guys. I have a question regarding whether my conclusion is accurate that I can write off buying mortgage points in my federal taxes. Firstly, I am going to make around $200,000 this year and my federal tax burden will be $41,000. So my rate lock for my construction house loan is 4.25%. My current loan amount is $348,500 with only 3% down. My mortgage lady stated to bring down my interest rate to 2.25 will be $32,000 which would bring my mortgage down from $1,711 to $1,330. The kicker is that if I itemize my taxes next year and claim the points as well as my tithe for the year of $14,000 I should receive a full federal tax return of $41,000. I have read the irs stipulations and it appears I qualify to write off my mortgage points since I will be paying cash for the points. Am I missing anything guys? Thank you in advance!",finance,1651843683
stocks,How to protect the purse during the stock market crash?,"**First, shorting the market**

Want to ""short"" the stock market when you think it will keep falling? There are a few trading platforms where you can short stocks or short the S&amp;P 500 - ProShares ETF ($SH ) is an option, a simple and liquid tool that allows retail investors to see their stocks as the stock market declines. Invest in growth and profit. The roughly $2 billion ETF has moved in the opposite direction of the S&amp;P 500's daily moves.

In the long run, it's not exactly a 1:1 inverse relationship with the S&amp;P 500, but it's very close. For example, the ETF has gained 7.2% over the past month; the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 7.4% over the same period through Thursday's close.

There are other types of ""inverse"" funds that can short the market as well. For example, if an investor wants a more tech-focused fund to bet on the decline of this particular sector, consider the Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF ($SARK).

The roughly $350 million ETF has performed in stark contrast to ark Innovations ETF ($ARKK). ARKK was once all the rage and is now in trouble, and the ""inverse"" fund has gained 27.7% in the past month.

As a reminder, when the stock market goes up, these inverse funds go down.

**Second, tail risk ""insurance""**

The Cambria Tail Risk ETF ($TAIL) is more of an insurance policy, a unique investment vehicle focused on buying ""out of the money (or out of the money)"" puts on the U.S. stock market while heavily under-allocated Risky U.S. Treasuries.

When the market is stable, these long-term options don't cost much, but they are an insurance tool that investors pay to protect against ""catastrophes."" Just like car insurance, when a crash occurs, people are compensated to cover the loss. When the Dow fell more than 1,000 points on Thursday, the ETF gained 2.2%.

Over the past year, though, the ETF has lost more than 11%, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500's 4% drop over the same period; that's the price you pay when this ""insurance"" isn't needed— But in turbulent times like the current one, that protection can come in handy.

**Third, the covered call option strategy**

Many investors use options to reduce risk or achieve higher returns, but if investors aren't interested in doing options trading themselves, a fund like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ($JEPI ) might be worth a look. The $9 billion ETF invests in the S&amp;P 500, but its managers also sell options on large-cap U.S. stocks using a strategy known as a ""covered call.""

Simply put, selling these options contracts limits your upside if the market is skyrocketing, but guarantees cash flow if the market moves sideways or falls. With that in mind, the ETF has yielded about 8.0% over the past 12 months -- and while it's down 5.5% over the past month, it's not as bad as the S&amp;P 500 (down 7.5%) over the same period .

If investors prefer to deploy this strategy on a tech-intensive benchmark, the Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF ($QYLD ) might be worth a look. The ETF is about $7 billion in size and is tied to the Nasdaq 100 index.

**Fourth, low volatility ETFs**

Unlike traditional investment strategies, low-volatility funds exclude the fastest-moving stock picks. This naturally means that they may underperform when markets are booming, but they tend to be ""not so bad"" when markets are turbulent.

Take the $9 billion-plus S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF ($SPLV), which has underperformed for three or five years as volatility has been rising due to a generally benign stock market environment. In 2022, it's down 5.2%, but that's well below the S&amp;P 500's 13% drop over the same period.

Other ""low volatility"" funds worth checking out: the global-focused iShares Minimal Volatility ETF ($EFAV), which invests in low-volatility stocks in Europe, Oceania, and the Far East.

**Fifth, (nearly) immediate maturity bonds**

The interest rate environment is unstable. But by shortening the bond's maturity to almost immediate maturity, you can get a little bit of a gain and largely avoid the risk of rising interest rates.

The popular iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ($TLT ) is down more than 22% in 2022 on rising interest rates, but its sister fund, the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF SHY, is down just 3.1% -- yielding around 2%, helping to offset the decline.

If investors want to shift their sights from solid U.S. Treasuries to short-term corporate bonds, the Pimco Enhanced Short-Maturity Active ETF ($MINT ) is worth a look, which is down just 1.85% this year and has a similar annual return; Saying this is ""walking in place"".

As a reminder, neither of these short-term bond funds will significantly increase people's wealth, but these types of funds are worth a look if you want to earn a little income while preserving your principal.

**Sixth,interest rate hedged bonds**

Another way to enter the fixed income market is to opt for bonds but add a strategy designed to offset the headwinds of rising interest rates. Such funds might look at the roughly $379 million WisdomTree Interest Rate Hedged U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund ($AGZD ), which attempts to achieve this by holding investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries — but also has a short position against U.S. Treasuries. The fund is provided income from corporate bonds, while short positions offset potential declines in the value of principal.

As counterintuitive as it may sound, in theory, short positions are offset by these long positions to offset potential declines in the value of principal. Theoretically it means that not all will work, but so far this approach seems to be working. The fund is down 1.45% in 2022 while the rest of the bond market has been in turmoil -- giving shareholders about 2% at current annualized yields.

**Seventh, face the strategy of raising interest rates**

What if investors were less inclined to hedge with current interest rate volatility? Then consider paying attention to the Simplify Interest Rate Hedging ETF ($PFIX ), which is about $200 million in size.

The fund holds a large position in over-the-counter rate options whose value will rise as long-term interest rates rise. Given the Fed's recent moves, this strategy has paid off considerably.

The ETF surged 5.4% on Thursday as Wall Street digested the Fed's move and other developments. Year-to-date, the ETF is up 63% as bond yields rise steadily.

**Eighth, commodities**

While stocks and bonds play an important role in diversifying a portfolio (regardless of the broader economic situation), it is increasingly important to acknowledge that they are not the only two types of assets.

One of the easiest ways to get diversified, easy access to commodities investing through exchange-traded products is the Commodity Optimized Income Fund ($PDBC). The $9 billion fund is made up of some of the world's most popular commodity-related futures contracts, including aluminum, crude oil, corn, gold, wheat and more. Best of all, it's structured in a way that protects investors from annoying paperwork and the dreaded K-1 tax form that comes with some commodity-related investment strategies.

Of course, if you want a special style, there are also dedicated commodity funds to consider — like the $68 billion gold ETF-SPDR (GLD), or the red-hot U.S. Natural Gas Fund ($UNG) — which this year Soaring 140% year to date.

Diversified funds like PDBC are a better option if investors want to play more defensively than trading based on a single commodity.

**Ninth, Standard Index Fund**

Are these choices confusing to you? Keep in mind then - over the long term, stocks are up; at least during the Great Recession, stocks' 10-year rolling returns have been positive...so the real cure for a losing portfolio might just be be patient.

The bear market low of the S&amp;P 500 at the time of the financial crisis was 666 on March 6, 2009, and the benchmark stock index is now above 4,000. Even though investors had the worst of times before the crisis, putting all their investments into pre-Lehman highs; investors still made money by comparison considering the index's 2007 closing peak of 1,565 of.

With this in mind, investors may consider long-term purchases like S&amp;P 500 ETFs ($SPY ) or other index funds, as well as the other tactical options mentioned above.

financialindependence,Downturn - who's getting excited?,"Who else is getting excited?

VTI per-market is trading at ~$205, down from the year's start at $242.  SP500 P/E is ~21, down from the mid-30's of late 2021.  Before COVID (which rebounded quickly), the last time it was this multiple was 2015.

As someone who started residency/entry role in 2009, I'm excited at this recent downturn.  The non-stop upward market and ballooning housing prices (other than COVID) has presented no great buying opportunities:

*My career income is at all times high and 8x my starting (which started really low) with RSU scheduled to add another 2x that residency salary in 2 years.  I'm hungrily buying with every peak-earnings paycheck I can get my hands on.

*Housing is set with a low 2.875% mortgage and being eroded by inflation

*Interest rates are slowly ticking up (iBonds notwithstanding) and Powell said at least one more hike in June; I was tired of looking at EE bond and thinking that 3.5%/20-year doubling is a ""good deal""

*Big ERN's SWR series and Pfau's annuity work had me worried about the SWR (especially worrying using ERN's CAPE methods).  No longer.  Interest rates up and P/E down.

If this downturn continues (either in depth or length), I might hit my number quicker than my spreadsheet said.


Edit: There are couple of comments that I need to acknowledge the potential pain that many will feel from this and specifically job loss.

Please, please, please remember the stock market is not the job market.  We learned this lesson again during the COVID rebound.  Employment rates were the worst since the Great Depression and the market price didn't care.  Do not mistake a market downturn for job loss.

My empathy started when it was dangerous to earn a living and school's closed from COVID (2020-current) and later when housing and energy got expensive, especially in the second half of 2021.  This was pre market downturn.  The market downturn is in response to interest rates rising.  Interest rate rising is good for savings accounts, dampening housing prices increases, and dampens inflation.  In net, I view these events as a net benefit for people and simultaneously a buying opportunity.  Moreover,  [U.S. job growth solid in April; unemployment rate steady at 3.6%](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-job-growth-solid-april-unemployment-rate-steady-36-2022-05-06/).  So no job loss, yet.  We can put the cork back in the bottle when it hits 5%.",finance,1651844414

Here are some of the stories we'll be covering: 

**India gives orgs 6 hours to report cyber incidents**  
India’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), has issued a new directive that requires service providers, corporations, and government entities to report cyber incidents within 6 hours of detection. The mandate also requires virtual asset, exchange, and wallet providers to maintain records on KYC and financial transactions for a period of five years. Additionally, service providers will be required to maintain 180 days worth of system logs and will need to assist India’s CERT with cyber incident remediation activities. Meanwhile cloud and VPN providers will now need to register validated names, emails, and IP addresses of their subscribers.

**The White House wants more powers to crack down on rogue drones**  
The White House has laid out its plans to give authorities more power to respond to nefarious drone activity which poses risks to public safety, privacy and homeland security. The plan proposes to expand the use of technologies that can identify and neutralize rogue drones, for example RF jammers, for federal agencies including Departments of Justice, Defense, State, and Homeland Security as well as the CIA and NASA. In addition, state and local authorities as well as critical infrastructure owners and operators would have expanded authority to use anti-drone technology. Currently, non-federal entities need to seek assistance from authorized entities, like DHS, to respond to drone threats.

**Solana network goes dark after bot swarm**  
A swarm of bots hit the popular NFT minting tool called Candy Machine over the weekend, hiting it with four million transaction requests and 100 gigabits of data per second, ultimately pushing validators of the blockchain out of consensus. The network went dark for roughly seven hours as a result, only coming back online after restarting the validators in an effective hard fork. It’s unclear at this point how the bot swarm caused it to lose consensus.

**DoD phished for $23.5 million**  
The US Department of Justice convicted California resident Sercan Oyuntur of multiple counts related to phishing activities against the Defense Department, finding he incurred $23.5 million in damages. This began in September 2018, when Oyuntur registered the [dia-mil.com](http://dia-mil.com/) domain for its phishing operations, similar to the legitimate dla.mil domain. He used the domain to send emails to users of a vendor database to a fake [login.gov](http://login.gov/) site, where Oyuntur would steal credentials. He eventually obtained credentials for a Southeast Asia corporation with active fuel provision contracts, and changed the banking information to a foreign account he controlled.

**Results from the first defense industrial base bug bounty**  
Almost 300 security researchers took part in the Defense Industrial Base Vulnerability Disclosure Program (DIB-VDP) Pilot over the last twelve months, turning up over 400 valid vulnerabilities. HackOne ran the pilot in coordination with the Defense Cyber Crime Center and Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, looking at 41 entities and 348 systems. This represents a small amount of the organizations that contract directly with the Pentagon, estimated on the low-end to be 100,000. The Pentagon hopes to take lessons learned from the pilot to inform a larger funded program.

**Decade-old bugs discovered in Avast, AVG antivirus software**  
Researchers have disclosed two high-severity vulnerabilities in Avast and AVG antivirus products which have gone undetected for ten years. On Thursday, SentinelOne published a security advisory on the flaws, tracked as CVE-2022-26522 and CVE-2022-26523. Avast acquired AVG in 2016 for $1.3 billion. According to the cybersecurity firm, the vulnerabilities have existed since 2012 and, therefore, could have affected ""dozens of millions of users worldwide."" SentinelLabs reported the vulnerabilities to Avast on December 20, 2021 and they were patched by February 11. SentinelLabs said there is no evidence of active exploitation in the wild.

**CDC purchased phone location data during pandemic**  
According to newly released documents, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bought access to location data harvested from tens of millions of phones in the US to track compliance with curfews, visits to K-12 schools, and compliance with policies in the Navajo Nation. The CDC paid $420,000 to controversial data broker, SafeGraph, for access to one year of data. Google removed SafeGraph from its Play Store in June of last year. While the CDC used COVID-19 as a reason for purchasing the data, it also intended to use it for more general CDC purposes including monitoring visits to parks, gyms, and weight management businesses.

**Biden orders new quantum push to ensure encryption isn't cracked by rivals**  
US president Joe Biden issued two directives on Wednesday aimed at ensuring the nation – and like-minded friends – remain ahead of other countries in the field of quantum computing. Especially as applied to cryptography. The first directive, creates a National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee comprising up to 26 experts from industry, academia, and federal laboratories – all appointed by the president and under the authority of the White House. The second is a memorandum designed to promote US leadership in quantum computing while mitigating risks to cryptographic systems. While acknowledging the positive developments that quantum computing can bring, his statement also issued a stark warning: “Research shows that at some point in the not-too-distant future, when quantum computers reach a sufficient size and level of sophistication, they will be capable of breaking much of the cryptography that currently secures our digital communications on the Internet.”

personalfinance,My HR block tax pro ghosted me - can I dispute the charge on my cc?,"This was our first (and last ever) time using HR Block and I'm wondering about recourse. We submitted all required documents in late March after meeting with our tax pro in person. I told them multiple times that I receive both W2s and have untaxed income (graduate student). We messaged via the online messaging portal on April 14 to check in - no response. Received our return on April 15, but it did not include any of my untaxed income (stipend) on there. We re-sent the forms on April 15, requesting this person to please include the stipend. No response. 

They charged us $215 on April 18. We messaged again on April 18 and frantically filed for an extension the evening of the 18th. We never heard back. 

I have obviously dropped the ball on following up immediately after April 18 (today is May 6) but have been calling the office every few days - they are closed almost every day. Today I called the customer service hotline and they told me to try and get into another office -- all of which are still closed today. It's difficult for either of us to go in person because both of us work long hours and don't usually get back home until \~7 or 8pm on weekdays. If required though, I will take a day off to get into that office.

Luckily, I don't think we will owe money (so no IRS fine) but is there any recourse? I checked their guarantees and it really only seems to refer to the online software, not in-person tax consultation. Also it seems to only provide for a 20% discount on next year's tax services and I never want to work with them again. Am I missing any of the fine print? I was considering disputing the charge on my cc because I'm so upset, but it seems inappropriate as they did provide service - it's just extremely shitty. Wondering what the great people of r/personalfinance think is appropriate. Thank you!

TL;DR: Submitted all tax documents early, HR block tax pro completed return without including my income and charged $215 for service. We have filed a federal extension, but after multiple attempts to contact, have not heard back. What should we do? Can we get any money back?",finance,1651849052

personalfinance,Insurance is not covering my $200 annual visit labs citing they were drawn on a different day,"I had an annual office visit in March of this year but I didn't have my labs related to this visit done until 3 days later (I hadn't been fasting on the same day). I have these visits every year and for the last 4 years, the labs have been covered. The insurance claims person I talked to said this is for 2 reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

* She said that they don't cover labs that aren't done on the same day, regardless if they are tied to the same visit and drawn at the office of the provider
* She cited federal law saying that US federal law mandates they charge me because the labs are diagnostic and not preventative. She said the doctor added some codes including things like insomnia and anxiety and that made them diagnostic (even though none of those were new diagnosis). She also claims US law and not the insurance provider defines how an insurance classifies a visit (diagnostic vs preventative). 

The key issue here being that preventative is covered and diagnostic goes towards my deductible. She said the last annual visit she could find in her system is from 2018, implying either my doctor has been filing them different or I just misremember having had them. So we couldn't see how it was done differently in those years where I didn't have to pay. Our conversation wasn't very constructive. I wanted to know that if I am not in the wrong here, if I have recourse. In that case, I also need to know how to talk to a claims person when I call back. This was my first time doing it, and it was rather infuriating when she stopped listening and started reading from legislation.",finance,1651854989

CryptoCurrency,"How is no one talking about the US GDP being down 1.1% while it was expected to rise 1.4%. That's a major 2.4% difference from estimates. A Recession is nearly inevitable at this point, it's good and bad for Crypto.","This may be a bit of a late news but just a week ago the US reported their GDP numbers for Q1. The Wall Street was expecting a 1.1% rise in the GDP which was reasonable but also pretty low and definitely under what they would have expected it to be now from a year ago. What happened then? The US reported a 1.4% decrease in the GDP instead.

This is major, a whole 2.5% difference from what was expected and the stock market that usually drops a stock by 20% if they miss estimates by even 1%, did nothing. They completly ignored it. Also the fact that this is one step closer to a recession in the US, something that just as inflation has been denied of happening there a couple of times. 

Recession at this point is actually already inevitable as the next US quarter is not looking any good either with macro economic tensions continuing. 

For Crypto that could be a good sign as the pressure on the stock market due to this may cause the FED to soften or aboard their harsh hiking policy. But on the other side it will be a recession and markets have never reacted that good to a recession at first.

No matter what, the macro economic tensions just seem to be increasing more and more. I'm not saying that we won't get a Crypto rally this year but with the current situation I can at least say it won't be next month.",cryptocurrency,1651858262

I know it’s important to have your emergency fund in an easily accessible spot, so I don’t want to tie it up into any kind of long term fund. My current plans is to set up a ladder of 3mo/6mo/9mo/12mo so if I ever truly need money from this fund, I wont have to wait anymore than 3 months tops to get about 4 months of monthly expenses. 

My question is, I was originally planning on putting the money into CDs, but it looks like the yield on taxable municipal bonds is much higher than CDs. I know taxable municipal funds mean they’re federally taxable, but so are CDs in any gains earned from interest, no? So is there any downside to going with a taxable municipal fund with a maturity date that lands within my established schedule? Is there anything I should keep in mind when purchasing taxable municipal bonds?

Any help would be appreciated! :)",finance,1651864220
investing,Why is the risk-free rate of return often considered as the discount rate for future cash flows?,"Based on my understanding of the discount cash flow model, the intrinsic present value of an investment is modeled by discounting the value of the investment's future cash flows^a by some rate on the time until each cash flow occurs. Without getting into the specifics of calculating the discount rate, different sources give different justifications for discounting future cash flows. Within the same article, [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) describes the discount rate as both:
* an adjustment for the declining time value of money (inflation?)
* a valuation of the investment's opportunity cost (the missed income that could have been made from alternative investments?).

Although the former explanation makes more sense to me, the financial press often fill the void between earnings reports with articles about how the Fed's changes to the risk-free rate of return^b affect stock valuations. **Is the discount rate most influenced by inflation or by the risk-free rate of return?**

(a) I'm using a broad definition of cash flow to describe all kinds of investments. A more specific definition of cash flow would be earnings for non-income-yielding equities, retained earnings plus dividends for income-yielding equities, and interest for debts.

(b) The risk-free rate of return is usually taken to be the yield on either the thirteen-week US Treasury bill or the ten-year US Treasury note. Turning the dials on the global money machine is a perk of being the back-to-back World War champion.",finance,1651864712
stocks,Five Things I am Thinking About In This Bear Market,"**1. There is no rush. No rush whatsoever to do anything. Seriously. Just sit and watch, and watch.** Who cares if the market rips higher on a random day like it did this week after the Fed. The Nasdaq-100 alone is down almost 25% since the start of the year. Okay, so it spikes 2% in a day... it still needs to climb an absurd percentage to get back to even. Plenty of time to watch, wait, and find a really nice entry. Patience is on your side right now.

**2. The last few years were truly bull market mania. One could argue making money wasn't that hard - just buy a growth stock! Those days are over.** The amount of research you have to do now is endless. If you don't spend at least several days (probably weeks) diving into a company, its earnings reports, expectations, valuation, trading range and volume, then don't even think about buying. With time on your side, do the necessary research now more than ever. By the way, I mention trading range and volume so you can really understand how much volatility to expect. If you see something that's moving 5%-10% a week, my goodness, buckle up and at least do the necessary research to understand that might happen.

**3. Zoom wayyyyyy out. Last I saw nearly 2,000 stocks were down 50% or more over the last 12 months. Cut in half! 2,000 stocks cut in half in 12 months.** Zoom way out and really understand where the stocks you're interested in have come from. Ask yourself about their previous drawdowns and study those. Where and when was the IPO? Where did it trade at 10 years ago? 5 years ago? You get the idea. The last 12 months are meaningless now.

**4. Look at what the founder, managers, and largest holders are doing. Are they themselves buying more or saying things you agree with?** The interesting thing is that in this social media age, you can find founders and managers tweeting, on Youtube, podcast interviews, or publishing around the web about their company thoughts! Go check out their thoughts and make sure you are aligned with them. Especially now. Don't buy any company when you don't agree with what the key people are writing or talking about. This is a challenging time to invest, but also to be a shareholder. Find the managers and founders who have the skills and guts to get through this.

**5. This last comment is more-so for everyone who is trying to day or swing trade because they think they can catch a bottom. If you don't think a company can be here in 5 or 10 years, why even risk money on it for 30 minutes?** If we really are in a bear market, well, they can last up to two years. Sometimes, they can last up to several years chopping sideways time and time again. Stick to quality, understand the brand, and the long term vision. If you're going to swing trade, at least swing trade something that's of quality.

That's it!

personalfinance,Question about trading in a car while its under a loan,"Hello. Decided to keep living with parents instead of moving out during these weird inflation/student loan uncertainity times. I plan to stay until at least june 1st 2023 as that is when my girlfriend graduates college and we are planning to move in together. Currently I make 65k a year with a 5% bonus. My current monthly dues are:

400$ car payment

100$ gas 

100$ car insurance (Im under 25)

320$ phone bill (paying for 4 people, AKA my rent for living with my parents. 80 of it is my own)

200$ groceries

Take home pay is around 3800 a month.  I general save around 2 - 2.5k a month after recreational spending. currently have 5k saved up and my only debt is 45k student loans and car note.

&amp;#x200B;

I owe 19k on my current 21 civic, and checking through KBB and other online trade in evaluers looks like I can get around 24-26k for my car with two offers for 24k from a local dealer and carmax. My commute is arund 40-60 minute one way depending on rush hour traffic. Because of this, I spend a lot of time in my car and am thinking of getting a new car, either a fun car (likely more on gas) or a plug in hybrid (less on gas). 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I have a 1.9 rate on my loan. This is pretty good and will see if I can get something similar. If I do decide to get a more fun car (thinking of like in the upper 20k low 30k range after taxes) I would likely want to trade it in again in around a years time to something cheaper when I move out since like with my current car, I expect the value to hold due to the used car market/chip shortage/inflation/whatever the heck is going on in America right now (I bought my current car a year ago and its worth 5k+ more than owe on it right now). How much would it matter if I cannot get a good rate if I plan on trading it in in a years time? And how plausible is this idea? Does it make sense to buy a fun car to drive for a year to trade it in once I move out? I know leases exist but I feel like its smarter to finance a car and trade it in then lease with the current car market. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another line of thinking is getting a more long term car (Plug in hyrbid since my work has charging stations but my parents house can't support a full EV) and making larger payments while I live with my parents depending on interest rate. But then if I'm going that route I feel like it makes more sense to stick with the low rate 19k loan and make the minimum while I put my money into student loans or something. The problem is even if i decide to go the conservative route, I don't know what to put the money I'll be saving towards, either keep my current car and put savings towards studen loans or take advantage of the pause to invest in a newer car that would save money on gas that I normally wouldn't be able to get. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd appreciate any advice on both options.",finance,1651868794

personalfinance,Does it make sense to refinance to consolidate credit card debt?,"I know, I know. I’ve done a lot of research to find out what is the best option to save the most money and get my finances in order moving forward but I’m having a hard time deciding what to do. Info below:

Home purchased in 2017 for $150,000 4.375%
Current payment is $1064/month
Includes escrow (taxes,insurance 263.06) and PMI (86.69)

Currently valued around $250,000 based on recently sold comps, I haven’t gotten an appraisal yet but have talked to a few people who agree this is reasonable. 

I was furloughed for a year between 2020-2021, and put my mortgage in forbearance for 12 months. I had the payments put in a deferred balloon payment, knowing I would be looking to refinance after the 90 day waiting period went by. 

Current unpaid principal: $130,647
Deferred principal balance: $13,797

I tried to refinance about 2 months back, which ended up falling through. They said they were unable to qualify me under conventional, only FHA which required a 12 mont waiting period from exiting the forbearance. I still don’t quite understand why I couldn’t qualify for a conventional at that time, just that my credit score/DTI wasn’t sufficient.  So I’ve been working on my credit score, and reapplied to some different mortgage refinance companies and my credit score pulled at 704. The only thing bringing my score down is high credit card balances, which have been increasing since the pandemic and have gotten to a point where I don’t see a way I will be able to pay them down through traditional routes. 

Here is one option I was given for a cash out refinance:

$186,000 loan 30 year conventional 
$1335/month (including escrow for taxes/insurance, PMI is gone)
Refi at 5.75% 
Pays off current balance, balloon payment, and approximately $28,000 of consumer debt (interest rates vary, average around 15%)

Does it make sense to refinance even though it’s a higher rate than what I have currently? It seems to make sense to me, because I’m paying about $250/month in interest alone for the credit cards anyway and the monthly payment is increasing by $270. 

I got another also quote for: 

$192,000 loan, 30 year conventional 
$1400/month (including escrow for taxes/insurance, PMI is gone)
Refi at 5.99%
Pays off current balance, balloon payment, approx $28,000 of consumer debt, and approx $6,000 cash at closing

Of the 2, I’m leaning toward the first one. 

I just wanted to see if anyone thinks this is a big mistake or has any other ideas before I move forward. I’ve looked into heloc or home equity loans but the rates don’t seem that much better and I would rather have the ease of one monthly payment. The peace of mind of being rid of all the credit card debt is another non-monetary bonus I’m looking forward to. I already know I need to NOT use the cards again to prevent this situation from recurring. I’m currently receiving treatment to help with impulsive behavior and have a support system in place to help me stay on track.

personalfinance,How to manage upcoming relocation,"Trying to figure out the best means to manage a relocation from a LCOL area to a HCOL area. I'll likely be moving within the next 9-12 months.

The home I am in will likely leave me with \~$200,000 with which I can either hold on to, or purchase another home. I don't intend to live in location B for more than 5 years, and have no plans to return to location A. The company I work with assists with relocation such that I don't pay closing costs on purchase or sale. They'll also cover 95% of up to $50,000 loss on any sale. There is a short-term cost of living adjustment they provide, but nothing that truly supports maintaining my current lifestyle as-is, all things considered.

My concern is, a comparable home to what I currently live in may very well be 50-70% more than what I could sell my current home for. With interest rates having increased for mortgages, coupled with a higher mortgage cost, I'm concerned about buying. I can make concessions and purchase a home of lesser means to help offset, but either way, I'm concerned that we may enter a similar situation of 2008 that may put me upside down on the mortgage when it's time for me to relocate again. I already max out my 401K and IRA accounts and plan to continue to do so. My goal is to retire within about 18-20 years with no debt (including a fully paid off mortgage), just to help provide perspective on the timescales I'm working against. 

So my question then becomes do I:

a) Purchase a home of equivalent or lesser amenities?

b) Use the proceeds from selling my home to invest, and purchase when the market stabilizes/rates improve?

c) Use the proceeds from selling my home for an account that yields high-% dividends whose payments can help fund renting a home? And use whatever capital appreciates to help fund a future home purchase when market conditions are more agreeable?

d) Some other idea that I'm not thinking of?

Appreciate any and all responses! Let me know if I can provide any additional information if needed.",finance,1651877304

Pretty upset right now.  I closed on a house this morning, and I have been holding off on buying a new vehicle I need, because I didn't want to touch my credit before the house closed.  So as soon as I got the green light, I went to the credit union and applied.  

I was feeling pretty good, walking in knowing my credit score is 776 because the home lender checked it a few weeks ago.  The 3 numbers were 776, 765, 808.  I told the loan officer my credit is 776 and she said more than likely we will get an instant approval for the $25k auto loan.

So, we fill out the application and she needs to run my credit.  It comes back 716.  I've never been so shocked in my life.  I was expecting a 15-20 pt hit from closing the house, not 60.

So, ok, my interest rate almost doubles but it's not the end of the world I suppose.  Send in the application.  Two hours later, I get a voicemail letting me know my app was denied.  Reason given, ""lack of credit history and no previous auto loans.""  Oh ok, so in order to qualify for an auto loan, I need a history of auto loans.  Makes sense.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 9th, 2022.

# **Stocks could see more tumult next week, especially if bond yields continue to scream higher - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/stocks-could-see-more-tumult-next-week-especially-if-bond-yields-continue-to-scream-higher.html)**
*****
&gt; After a week of extraordinary turbulence, stocks are likely to remain volatile as investors await fresh data on inflation and watch the course of bond yields.
*****
&gt; The big report for markets is Wednesday’s April consumer price index. Economists expect a high inflation reading, but it should moderate from the 8.5% year-over-year pace of March. A second inflation report, the producer price index, which is a gauge of wholesale prices, is released Thursday.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s going to be a hot number but not as sizzling as last month,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Zandi expects headline CPI to rise 0.3% for the month or 8.2% year-over-year.
*****
&gt; Investors are honing in on inflation and other key reports that will influence the Federal Reserve as it moves forward with interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The Fed raised its fed funds target rate by a half percentage point Wednesday, and signaled it could follow up with more hikes of the same size. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, following the meeting, said he expects the economy could see a “soft or soft-ish” landing.
*****
&gt; “I think the two big concerns for the market are inflation and how hawkish the Fed will be trying to get that under control,” said Art Hogan chief market strategist at National Securities. Hogan said investors are also concerned about China’s economy as it locks down to fight Covid and how that slowing could impact the rest of the world.
*****
&gt; Hogan said if the CPI comes in as expected that could bring some stability to both stocks and bonds, since it would then appear that inflation has peaked.
*****
&gt; Stocks were wildly volatile in the past week, notching big intraday swings in both directions. The S&amp;P 500, closed at 4,123 and was down just 0.2% for the week. The Nasdaq was off 1.5% for the week
*****
&gt; Energy was by far the best performing sector, rising 10% for the week. REITs were the worst performing, down more than 3.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 3.4%.
*****
&gt; Stock investors have also been eyeing the bond market, where yields have been rising as bonds sold off.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield pushed through 3% for the first time since late 2018 in the past week. On Friday, the yield was at 3.13%, up from 2.94% the Friday before. The rising 10-year yield has had a stranglehold on stocks, particularly growth and tech, during its rapid move higher.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year was at about 1.5% at the start of the year. Many lending rates are linked to it, including mortgages.
*****
&gt; “If people figure out inflation is peaking, and you could make the argument that the 10-year yield will not necessarily peak, but will stop going parabolic...that’s what could get the public to slow down the selling,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said retail investors have been heavily invested in growth names. Those stocks do better when money is cheap.
*****
&gt; “The bond market is calling the tune here,” he said. But he expects the stock market is in the process of finding its low-water mark. “What we’ve seen is both upside and downside volatility in equities…and that’s the start of a bottoming process.”
*****
&gt; Some technical analysts said stocks could take another dip lower if the S&amp;P returns to Monday’s low of 4,062 and stays there.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, targeted 3,850 on the S&amp;P as the next stop lower, if the index breaks the Monday low.
*****
&gt; “As of now, it looks like every rally where you can get an oversold bounce has been sold,” he said. “I think the weekend news is going to play a factor into the emotional open Monday.”
*****
&gt; He said there could be news on Ukraine, since it is Victory Day in Russia, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to speak.
*****
&gt; Redler said Microsoft and Apple could have a big impact on trading next week. If Apple breaks support at about $150 and Microsoft breaks $270, a level it’s been holding, the two biggest stocks could sweep the S&amp;P 500 below 4,000.
*****
&gt; “If they break those levels, it will add some grease to the wheels and bring the market to new lows. That could bring us closer to a tradeable low,” he said. Apple ended Friday at $157.28 per share, slightly higher on the day.
*****
&gt; Redler said if Microsoft breaks the $270 level, its chart would complete a negative head and shoulders formation that could signal more weakness for the stock. Microsoft closed at $274.73 per share Friday.

&gt; # 1970 All Over Again?

&gt; This comparison of 1960 &amp; 1970 to 2022 was first presented to subscribers &amp; @CMTAssociation Symposium. 2022 is tracking eerily close to those two bear market years. Today’s mammoth drop, the worst since 2020, doesn’t alleviate this alarming comparison.

&gt; Both 1960 and 1970 hosted recessions and rate increases in the prior year. Inflation in 1970 was closer to current conditions with CPI peaking around 6.5% year-over-year. At the end of April 2022 S&amp;P 500 was down 13.3%, the worst start since 1939. Only 1932 &amp; 1939 were worse. The second worst start since WWII was 1970.

&gt; It would be nice if 2022 played out more like 1960 with milder losses. Unfortunately, present circumstances are more akin to 1970. 1960 was also an election year, while 1970 was a midterm year like 2022.

&gt; This time is a little different due to covid-disrupted supply chains and the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with soaring energy and commodity prices. We are not implying the 36% bear market losses from the 1968 top to the 1970 bottom are in the cards, but we suspect that we have not found bottom just yet.

&gt; However, it is becoming increasingly likely we get a bottom sooner rather than later as we did in May 1970 with the Fed raising rates 50 basis points this week and Russia looking to chalk up a victory on WWII Victory Day celebrated on May 9 in Russia.

&gt; # Fed Day Follow Up

&gt; In last night's Closer, we recapped the market reaction to the FOMC's 50 bps rate hike noting that equities really took off once Fed Chair Powell ruled out the possibility of 75 bps hikes on the horizon. By the close, the S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.55% from right before the decision (1:59 PM). As shown below, that marked the third-best S&amp;P 500 reaction to a Fed day since 1994 when the FOMC began to announce its decision on the same day as the meeting.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/050522-Fed-Day-Follow-Up-1.png))**

&gt; Given today's massive declines, the S&amp;P has already erased its 2%+ post-FOMC gain. Below we show the S&amp;P's intraday performance the day after each Fed day when the index rallied over 2% post-meeting (1:59 to the close). For each day, the date shown represents the day of the FOMC meeting. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has tended to gap down the following day and continue to trade lower throughout the first post-FOMC session as we are seeing today.

&gt; Today's performance is certainly on the weaker end of these occurrences, though. In fact, like the other two largest post-FOMC rallies that saw over 3% gains in the afternoon of Fed days, December 2008 and August 2011, today saw a significant gap lower with continued losses through mid-morning. The continued selling today is setting up to more closely resemble the August 2011 occurrence. Following the December 2008 instance, on the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 found a low in the late morning and even briefly went positive the day after the big post-FOMC gain.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/050522-Fed-Day-Follow-Up-2a.png))**

&gt; While today is shaping up to look like another time the market rallied hard in response to the FOMC, taking a step back to look at all Fed day afternoon performance (1:59 to the close) versus next-day performance (full day), there is not much of a strong trend. As shown below, the S&amp;P 500's performance from 1:59 to the close on a Fed day is a statistically poor explainer of next-day performance. That being said, today does stand out as one of the worst Fed day follow-ups on record.

&gt; # NASDAQ Midterm Seasonal Pattern Trends Lower

&gt; NASDAQ’s midterm election year trend is no friend of the bulls. Off 21.2% year-to-date at the end of April clearly significantly lower than the average NASDAQ midterm year decline. But that does not mean that the decline is over. A plethora of headwinds from the War in Ukraine, negative GDP, midterm year and seasonal pressures, supply chain issues, inflation, and rate hikes are likely to conspire to push stocks lower in the near term, a prototypical midterm bottom does appear on the horizon over the next few months, which sets up the quadrennial buying opportunity ahead of the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle.

&gt; # The Quitter Market

&gt; If it seems to you like the market simply can't hold on to gains this year, you aren't mistaken. The chart below shows an intraday composite of the S&amp;P 500 on a median basis over the last 100 trading days through the end of April. The general pattern during this period has been for the market to open modestly higher, but then sell off for the remainder of the morning. It has then regained its footing shortly after mid-day but then sells off into the close.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/050422-Intraday-Composite.png))**

&gt; How does the last five months or so compare to history? The charts below really put the recent trend of intraday weakness into perspective.

&gt; The first chart shows the number of days over a rolling 100-trading day period that the S&amp;P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) traded in positive territory on an intraday basis but finished the day down. The reading currently stands at 38 and was as high as 40 (red line) in the last week of April. As shown in the chart below, there hasn't been another period that the S&amp;P 500 has had so much trouble holding onto intraday gains in more than a decade (October 2010)!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/050422-SPY-Up-But-Finished-Down.png))**

&gt; For the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ), it has been a similar story. As recently as April 22nd, the trailing number of times in the last 100-trading days that QQQ traded in positive territory on an intraday basis but finished the day lower reached 42 and currently stands at 40. Like SPY, the recent reading of 42 was the highest number of occurrences in a 100-trading day span since October 2010.

&gt; For both indices, the currently elevated frequency of giving up intraday gains has been extremely uncommon for the post-financial crisis period. Interestingly enough, though, in the ten years before the financial crisis, these types of periods were a lot more common, especially for the Nasdaq. Could it have anything to do with the fact that the last 12 years have also been one of the more accommodative monetary environments investors have ever experienced?

&gt; # Bond Market Massively Oversold

&gt; The sell-off in bond prices over the last six months has been extreme to say the least. There are a number of ways we could highlight the carnage for bond investors, but one way is to look at how far bond indices are trading below their 200-day moving averages. As shown below, the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Market Total Return index is currently 8.5% below its 200-day moving average.

&gt; # Recent 21-Year May Seasonal Pattern: More Chop Likely

&gt; May’s first two days have historically traded higher. Recent market volatility suggests another day of gains could prove challenging especially as the market awaits the Fed’s next move on Wednesday. Bouts of weakness often appears around or on the third, sixth, and twelfth trading days of the month while the last four or five trading days have generally enjoyed respectable gains on average. In midterm years it has generally been better to lighten up on long positions early in May as the entire month tends to be weak (pages 42 and 44 STA 2022).

&gt; # 4 Things You Didn’t Know, But Need To

&gt; 2022 has been one of the worst starts to a year ever for stocks and bonds. The reasons for the rough start, which are widely known, include inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed), soaring yields, the conflict in Ukriane, and a slowing economy.

&gt; So we know all of the worries, but now we’ll take a look at 4 things you might not know, but should.

&gt; A bad start to the year isn’t fun, but it isn’t always a sign of things to come. “2022 ranks as the third worst start to a year ever for the S&amp;P 500 Index,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But looking at the 10 worst starts ever shows that stocks tend to bounce back nicely the rest of the year, up 10% on average.”

&gt; As you can see below, continued huge losses the final 8 months are rare, with potential double-digit gains quite possible. The only years the final 8 months saw stocks lower were in 1941 (U.S. entered World War II), 1962 (The Kennedy Slide and Cuban Missile Crisis), and 1973 (oil spike and recession). We continue to expect the U.S. economy to grow at 3% in 2022 and avoid a recession, so an eventual large snapback rally later this year is quite possible.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-5.4.22.png))**

&gt; The Fed will likely hike rates today (we expect a 50 basis point, or 0.5%, hike). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous Fed rate hiking campaigns has seen stocks perform fairly well. Looking at times of aggressive rate hikes shows that in 1994 the Fed quickly hiked from 3% to 6% and stocks were flat, while over a two-year period from 2004 to 2006 they hiked from 1% to 5.25% and stocks gained 11%. Yes, some periods of rate hikes saw stocks decline, but a period of aggressive hiking simply by itself isn’t a reason to expect stocks to do poorly.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-2-5.4.22.png))**

&gt; Is a bear market possible without a recession? The answer is yes, but quite rare. Given the S&amp;P 500 has corrected nearly 14%, how likely is it that things could spiral into a bear market? Well, if we can avoid a recession (our base case) we’d say the odds are slim.

&gt; Looking back in history, 1987 was the last time the S&amp;P 500 was in a bear market without a recession. Then 1978, 1998, 2011, and 2018 all were more recent years that saw stocks nearly in a bear market (down 19%), but the economy avoided a recession. Adding up everything that we know, we’d side with a decline of 20% still not being our base case, with the market weakness likely closer to a major low than not.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-5.4.22-1.png))**

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 peaked on January 2 and so far the low during the correction was on April 29, for a 13.9% correction. Turns out, there have been 24 other corrections since World War II, with an average decline of 14.3%, while it took 133 days to find the ultimate low. Given the current correction is 13.9% and has lasted 117 days already, we are getting into the range where previous corrections indeed hit bottom.

personalfinance,HSA strategy help - spend it or invest,"I have about $3k in an HSA account from an older employer.  I don’t really need to use it since I have savings and a new FSA.  It eats $3 a month in fees. 

Should I just move it to Fidelity (where I have other accounts) and invest the $3k?  From what I understand that money grows tax free right?

Or should I spend it for copays etc.

Edit: let’s say I have some medical expenses in the next 2 month and I’m out of current FSA money (my plan year ends 6/30), I definitely should use it for expenses right?  I’m in the ~40% fed and state tax rate.",finance,1651887622
personalfinance,I want to save interest rate. Do you think this is good idea borrowing maximum and deposit with good interest rate and repayment early?,"I want to do home improvement but unfortunately I am currently bad for cash flow as I spent all moneys to property purchase and needed to spend some urgent maintenance work etc. When I applied for personal loans 9month ago, my interest rate was 15%. And I didn’t proceed with the agreement. And I look for loans now again, my interest was 8.6% now. It is not excellent but better than before. And I realised, if I borrow money more, interest rate gets lower. I actually need £10,000 but if I could get £15,000, £5000 I can deposit somewhere in short period savings.

defi,Rising Interest Rates = Boom Market for Stablecoins,"This week, the Fed raised the Fed Funds rate by 0.5%.  All signs point to continued interest rate hikes well into 2023.  Fed Funds rate expected to reach \~3% by 2023/24:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/the-fed-is-expected-to-raise-rates-by-a-half-point-investors-wonder-if-it-will-get-more-aggressive.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/the-fed-is-expected-to-raise-rates-by-a-half-point-investors-wonder-if-it-will-get-more-aggressive.html)

Currently sitting at 0.83%.  10Y US Treasury now yielding 3.14%.  2Y yielding 2.735%.  One year ago the 2Y was yielding 0.15%.  It's up 18X.  

So what does this mean for stablecoins?  The business model of a stablecoin is quite simple.  People give you money (USD), you give them a token representing 1 USD.  You don't pay them any interest.  The stablecoin issuer can then reinvest those dollars in (presumably) safe assets like government debt.  Some stablecoins like Tether are rumored to have invested funds in much more risky assets like Chinese commercial bonds in a chase for yield.

This was the landscape up until \~6 months ago.  Stablecoin issuers had to take risky investments to make a profit on deposits.  It's quite possible that Tether has lost significant amounts of money through their risky investments.  But today that is no longer necessary.  Today, stablecoin issuers can just throw customer funds in a US2Y bond and pocket 2.7%.

You might think 2.7% is bullshit.  But think about how much money is sitting in these stablecoins.  USDC has $48B alone.  At 2.7% that's about $1.3 Billion per year in yield.  Let's say they need to keep 10% of their cash onhand.  That's still over $1B.  

Interest rates are likely to continue increasing over the short term.  It's reasonable to believe the 2Y will hit 3% before the end of the year.  If a stablecoin issuer can pocket 3% in risk free profit on deposits, stablecoins are an amazing business.  And it makes the industry much safer.  Because the issuer of the stablecoin is no longer pressured to seek out risky plays for yield.  They can just buy US Bonds and count their money.  

Higher interest rates should bring huge opportunity to stablecoin issuers and really heat up competition in the industry.",cryptocurrency,1651897054

stocks,How many investors really think Ukraine is worth to fight for?,"Just curious to see... how many investors/traders believe that Ukraine is worth to protect? 

Simplest term is that 

1) Without Russia-Ukraine war, Inflation would have most likely hit the top in Q1 2022

2) With inflation rates declining and oil price stable at 80$, it would have given more time for Fed to react. It would have not even done any of the rate hike until 2023 like what Fed's dot plot said in Sep2021. There would have been higher chance for soft landing in both US/EU economy as well. But now it's almost guaranteed that EU zone will see recessions and US might be witnessing recession as well.  

Then Russia-Ukraine war breaks out, which changes all calculation here as Russia's oil is irreplaceable and both Russia/Ukraine export food and raw materials. 

3) Without the West's financial/military support, Ukraine would have not succeeded this far, if not lost within 3 days of the war (which was seemingly Russia's initial plan). If so (Ukraine capitulated within 3 days) then, perhaps, the West would have not sanctioned Russia this much enough that they would have not targeted Russian Oil and raw materials. 

So now.... 

1) Point of no return is already exceeded for Russia. So many of their soldiers' life bled too much and the sanction by West started, the best damage control for what Russia can do is to drag the war until a point for every consumers in the West, asking themselves if this war is, indeed, their best interest, if not just a mental relief.  

2)  West wont step back either because of all the atrocity we have witnessed in last 2 months, so at this point, no body is playing the game to win the war, but it's a game not to lose in this messy war.  

3) With all those being said, then ultimate question is... 

is this war worth for enduring financial pain we have been feeling? 

Because if Ukraine just accepts the term and conditions from Russia, and end war tomorrow, then perhaps, oil price will go down and inflationary pressures in commodities will ease, which will definitely help the pressure.  

Dont get me wrong, every part of me in my heart support Ukraine's fight for sovereignty, but my brokerage account says otherwise, so does many investor's brokerage/IRA/401K accounts, so I am just wondering this. 

I know it's about blame game, but that's what the real life is all about, right? 

I mean obviously there are other reasons such as too high demands and supply chain constraints particularly delayed by China, but this messy market all started when Russia invaded Ukraine with Putin exactly knowing the West's salted wound. Obviously, I dont condemn Ukraine's efforts for its sovereignty or anything, but it doesnt mean my investment is not affected either, so I am asking if this damage so far is worth?",finance,1651899009
personalfinance,Losing my leg has financially ruined me,"I have this posted on another sub but would appreciate any and all advice. 


I’ve worked blue collar hard labor jobs my entire life, I don’t have any other skills. I’m not charismatic with a good personality who makes the most out of any situation. I have zero skills outside labor. It's nearly impossible to find employment that doesn’t require a mandatory physical test, even office jobs. I’ve never been big on technology, I only recently received my first smartphone to use the internet.


I’m almost 40 with no debt but no credit. I used to take pride that I lived within my means, had a home with no mortgage, and a car with no payments. I’ve never had a credit card. There was never anything that I or my family wanted that I couldn't get with hard work and picking up overtime. I realize how entitled that sounds now.


I “had it good” until a work accident took my left leg and there hasn’t been a day that I haven’t wished it had killed me. My wife decided she wasn’t attracted to a man with one leg. While I was in the ICU and rehab to relearn how to be mobile again she filed for divorce. My accident and absence was hard for my son so I gave my wife the car and the house so my son wouldn’t be uprooted and would still have some familiarity in his life. I wasn’t taking his home away from him or her.


A relationship needs to have attraction, a woman has needs, I couldn't fault her for that and at the end of the day she was the mother of my son. I got to see my son whenever he wanted. I took my savings and bought an old RV for my cat and I. I was doing gig work before the gas prices went up, I didn’t have much but I had what I needed. I was waiting for my accident investigation to be complete and expected a decent payout.


On my son's 7th birthday he told me about the abuse he was going through that I had no idea about. I won’t go into details but I thought it was a cliche when you hear about a woman moving her new boyfriend in after dating for a week and allowing him to take over the house, “overlook/downplay” abuse, and be okay with losing the child she gave birth to.


I was not willing to give her a second chance nor was I going to just wait and see what happens. Once he told me they took away his way of communicating with me and made touching a grown man's foot a “chore”, that was it. I couldn't afford it but I got us into a place and got full custody of him.


Now we are rationing the last roll of TP, we got approved for food stamps but they aren’t emergency even though I told them we had no food, my ex isn’t paying her child support and quit her job. I utilize the food pantry but I’ve recently received an attitude from the worker who rolls her eyes and makes sure to yell loudly how many times in a row it’s been that I’ve been there.


I applied for a secured credit card through Capital One with a $200 limit but requires a $99 deposit. I won’t have that “disposable” income for weeks, maybe months. I’ve tried getting a loan from a bank and credit union but was denied. I’m looking into a payday loan but with my monthly income the interest rate is absolutely insane. Idk what to do.


I’m so screwed and exhausted. I feel like my son would be better off financially if I was dead.


Are there secured cards that don't require a deposit? 

TL:DR; Stuck in a “a day late and a dollar short” cycle and can’t start building my credit if I want to continue surviving. I’m drowning. Shady company is dragging their feet despite OSHA violations. I can’t get a loan.",finance,1651900743

Trading,Returns on an interest rate swap,"I would like to calculate returns for a plain-vanilla (fixed-for-floating) interest rate swap. Consider, that I am long in USD 5-year swap rate, i.e. I'm holding a receiver swap for 5-year swap rate with notional of 100$. At initiation, the swap should be valued at 0$, as both the fixed leg and the floating leg of the swap should have the same value.

If I valuate the receiver swap a month later and it would have a value of let's say 2$, then how should I calculate the return? Is it just (2$ - 0$) / 100$, i.e. change of swap value relative to the notional? I can't quite figure out how I could calculate the return by comparing change of value to previous value (or simply comparing consecutive values), as they can be at initiation 0$ and later be negative.

If the correct way is indeed to calculate returns relative to notional, then why is this? After all, I am not investing any capital on the swap (apart from some possible margin payments), so why should I use the notional in return calculations? For me a more natural way would simply be following the value of the swap and calculating the returns with consecutive values, but then I face the problems of negative values and zero values mentioned above.",finance,1651933032
stocks,Double whammy for foreign investors?,"Since interest rates are now finally going up, the dollar is increasing in value against other currencies. 

For example, GBP is down 11% from this time last year, whilst the S&amp;amp;amp;amp;P is down nearly 2% and the NASDAQ nearly 11%. Add those together and that’s a lot of red. 

On the bright side, the FX conversion for previous investments actually result in a temporary lower loss (or gain if you’re that good)  but moving forward, investing in the US markets with the dollar this strong is not looking very attractive at all. 

E.g Buying Google now at $2,300 would be the equivalent of buying it at $2,550 a year ago. Adding to that your own currency will hopefully go back up eventually, it’s all very depressing. Great company and  $price for the stock but the return is looking poor. 

Anyways, just my thoughts currently. At least with this FX I can sell my ARK I bought in January 2021 for 10% more than they’re worth :).",finance,1651933700

personalfinance,Should I move from a FHA to a Conventional Loan?,"I currently have a FHA mortgage, and my current loan owner keeps contacting me to see if I'd like to refinance to a Conventional. I'm still fairly new to this whole system of things, relatively speaking (I have had this mortgage for about 3.5 years now). They're offering to waive the origination, application, underwriting, and processing fees.

Given the current market, and the concern that a bubble pop might end up with me on the wrong side of things, I'm a bit wary of proceeding, even if I don't actually pull any money out of the accrued value of the house and just refinance to get rid of the fun fiddlybits required by a FHA. When would be a good time to look into this, and what should I look for in proceeding if I do, especially in any potential contract changes?

personalfinance,What should my wife and I do with our extra $37k in savings?,"My wife and I are in our mid early 20's and we are expecting a baby in the coming months. My wife just graduated and started a new job where take home after tax and medical insurance will be about $4k a month. I am finishing a degree and working part time and my take home is $2k a month. Our monthly expenses are about $3k-$3.5k. We have about $48k in savings and my wife is receiving a bonus from her job that will be about $7k after taxes. We have $18k in one account for 6 months of emergency expenses, and that leaves us about $37k of money that is just sitting. 

I have a 401k with about $12k in it and a Roth IRA with about $3.5k. My wife will start her 401k and contribute once she starts working and getting payed. Once I am back to working full time I will contribute to my 401k again, and currently my Roth I contribute $50 a month. We plan on contributing 5% to our 401k's once I start contributing again and she opens hers.  

Basically, we have $37k that we are looking to invest or do something with. We purchased a house last year and have done some maintenance and upgrades so we don't really have any need to do anything to the house, other than maybe a kitchen remodel, but we don't really feel that it's necessary. We already have retirement accounts going and an emergency fund and also plan to contribute to our child's college account once they are born. I should also add that we have no student debt and both of our vehicles are paid off. We understand that we are lucky to be in the situation that we are in and want to use this money to build more wealth and security. I am just not sure what to invest in. I was interested in buying a rental, but with the way interest rates are and the current housing market we kind of want to see what happens in the next couple years before we do so. 

I guess we are just not sure what to do with this $37k as well as the $1500-$2000 a month that we will be able to save. I also had the idea of just making double payments on our mortgage to basically cut down our mortgage and allow us to not pay as much interest so I guess invest in ourselves or our house? If that makes sense? We don't really have any business ideas and would love to franchise something, but that's just not realistic right now. We just aren't sure what to do. Do we invest in gold and silver? Do we invest in stocks? I just don't want to invest in something super risky and lose everything we've earned. I really ultimately would love to invest in something like a rental property that will be earning money each month.

personalfinance,Question on Bond Fund vs Stock Fund yields,"Hey all have a question about bond funds vs stock funds.  

**First some background on what I think I do understand.**  

I get that with an individual bond your principle invested is unchanged and you earn a true interest rate over time which is an amount over the value of the principle which can be referred to as the yield..  I also understand that with stocks and stock funds they can distribute dividends which are essentially the companies paying out some profits from the company to shareholders rather than reinvesting it into the company (ignoring dividends from covered calls etc) and that these are also called yields.  The yields from stocks and stock funds however, unlike individual bond yields, are distributed from the value of the stock and therefore come out of the value of the stock.  So in summary with bond value of $100 and a 2% yield you would end up with a bond valued at $102...so you have $2 more in value. With stock valued at $100 and a 2% yield the shareholder will receive $2 per share and the stock would then be valued $98 (ignoring growth for simplicity)...so you have the same amount of value.

I also get that bond funds operate differently.  They don't wait for bonds to mature and just produce their yields, they buy and sell bonds to maintain a certain time to maturity and therefore the value of the bond fund shares go up and down based on whether bond yields are going up or down.

**Okay so now the question.**    


What about bond funds, like VBTLX, that report a yield?  Is that yield like a dividend where it is distributed from the value of the shares of the fund, ie a 2% yield would reduce the share price 2%....or is it a true yield like with individual bonds where it is just an amount over the value of the share price that comes from the bonds in the fund accruing interest?

personalfinance,Car Loan Refinance Offers,"So, back at the end of 2019, I bought a brand new Hyundai Elantra from a Hyundai dealer in my city. My credit was pretty bad, around 550, and I went in knowing I wouldn't get the greatest of interest rates on a loan (assuming I could even get one from a new car dealer to begin with). I was prepared and knew I made enough money to pay whatever payment was thrown at me and so now here I am a few years later paying $458/month and about halfway through the principal on my original loan (I still owe about 10.2 grand over the remaining 31 months of my loan).

Throughout my life, I have been told by older and wiser folks in my family that refinancing my car loan was just objectively bad. However, I often receive offers in the mail or by email to do just that. I recently received an offer in the mail from ""Upstart"" to refinance my car loan, and they had a very quick and easy way to check new rates. The best offer given to me is $362/month for 31 more months. My brain tells me to click the remaining few buttons and go through with this as, contrary to advice given to me, it seems objectively great! Lower payment for the same loan term.

Am I missing something? I always assumed refinancing was totally okay if you don't have crazy fees for paying off a previous loan early. I also assume that (if refinancing is fine) I should check with other lenders (including my bank which offers refinancing) to see if their rates would be better than my current options.

Any advice would be awesome.",finance,1651955534

CryptoCurrency,The Bitcoin Bloodbath Will Get Worse. This Is Fine.,"The current crypto market carnage will probably get worse—but don't take your eyes off the big picture.

It's getting ugly out there.
Bitcoin is down over 8% this week and has fallen nearly 50% from last year's all-time-high. The situation isn't much better for Ethereum, down 5% over the week, while newer best-of-breed coins like Solana (SOL), Terra (LUNA), and Avalanche (AVAX) fell over 10% this week. Things haven't looked this bad in a while, and it's going to get worse before it gets better.

But don't be alarmed. Like the meme of the dog in a bowler hat sitting in a house on fire: This is fine.

Before getting into why things will be (mostly) fine, let's take a look at what's causing crypto to melt down in the first place.
The primary culprit is the global macroeconomy. Governments around the world are being walloped by inflation levels not seen in 40 years, and central banks are finally taking measures—like jacking interest rates and shrinking their balance sheets—to fix this. Unfortunately, this has meant taking away the cheap money punchbowl that has powered decades of surging stock and real estate prices.

The result has been a wipeout in both stocks and crypto (Bitcoin is more closely correlated with the Nasdaq than it's been in ages) and fear among investors. Meanwhile, other global events—from the war in Ukraine to new Covid lockdowns in China—are fueling further sell-offs and adding to the sense of unease. 
In these circumstances, is it any surprise people are flushing their Shiba Inu tokens? Many crypto enthusiasts, and Bitcoiners in particular, like to believe blockchains will supply an alternative financial reality when the world goes to hell, but it's clear that's not (yet) the case. Crypto is as prone to macroeconomic shocks as everything else.
Meanwhile, the crypto industry itself has become a bubble waiting to pop. Pick your example—from the glut of worthless Layer 1 chains to fly-by-night NFTs to Floyd Mayweather's latest pump-and-dump. There's a lot money being squandered in stupid ways. That's fine as long as there are enough ""greater fools"" out there to buy that garbage, but when the music stops, it's going to look a lot like the ICO fallout of 2018.
We might be at that stage again now. Paradoxically, though, the current carnage we're seeing should be cause for optimism.

Since the birth of Bitcoin, the crypto industry has been marked by spectacular booms followed by painful crashes. If history repeats itself—and I'm betting it will—the impending downturn will serve as a healthy cleanse and reboot for the industry.

That's what happened in 2013 when the price of Bitcoin brushed the once jaw-dropping figure of $1,200, only to plummet afterward. It took years to reach that level again, but in the interim, something remarkable happened: dedicated teams put their heads down and built a series of innovations that transformed the industry. By the time the next boom rolled around in 2016, crypto had gone from being just Bitcoin and a handful of altcoins like Litecoin and XRP to encompass smart contracts, utility tokens, and a multi-chain future.

A similar thing happened after the bust of 2018. When crypto came roaring back in 2021, the technology had changed profoundly. A series of stylish NFT platforms had eclipsed the primitive CryptoKitties of the previous boom, DAOs took off for real, and the entire plumbing of the industry had become far more sophisticated.

It's going to happen again. Just as in the past, the dilettantes and hustlers will move to some other shiny thing, while the real crypto believers will stick around to lay the groundwork for the next era of Web3.
It's hard to predict exactly what this next era will look like, but a good bet is that it will feature low gas fees, easy-to-use Layer 2 options, and NFTs moving to the core of the music and entertainment industries. It's a
fun future to imagine—provided you have the stomach to get through another Crypto Winter.

Things so simple that most people laughed, were too smart for, seeing right through their artless folly. How can for example, simply heating something save millions of lives and give onto the study of microbe science as Luis Pasteur discovered with pasteurization? Why is that a world altering discovery? Humans have a tendency to go out looking for complexity, and this I believe is called *complexity bias*, which sounds unique, in that the majority of cognitive biases exist to save mental energy, but really it is, in fact, another mental shortcut, one that makes me quite confident that bitcoin the network has exploited unrecognized simplicities, the telltale sign of technological treasure.

I’m looking to get a new car and want it to have all the latest safety systems. In my market the difference in price between a brand new vehicle with warranty and a used one with the right spec is marginal, so I think new makes more sense.

The models I’m considering will come to $24-33k.

I have the cash to pay this outright but also want to lay down a deposit on a house in the next year or two.

If I buy the car upfront it will wipe out about a third of my savings for that deposit.

For that reason I’ve been considering either leasing or a balloon loan where the monthly instalments are lower. All in, I could get a decent deal for between $300-350 a month.

What’s putting me off though is that in my market (Eastern European country) the interest rates are through the roof. The best I’ve seen is 7% and 11-12% is common. Mortgage rates would be similar (in fact a little more probably) so I’m not sure if this makes much difference in my case?

I’d be grateful for advice on how I can preserve a deposit for a house while getting a vehicle. The car is needed due to my current situation and I’m renting one short-term at the moment, which is much more expensive.

personalfinance,Mortgage lender rate bait &amp; switch,"Are there any laws that protect consumers if a mortgage lender prequalifies you, says this is the rate right now at this date and time (log-in to access, real-time system, date and time stamp), you make an offer, its accepted same day, you enter into contract with the seller, the rate is still that rate, you go to lock it, through all the screens it still says the rate, then on the last page where you press LOCK it goes up 1.0%?

personalfinance,Better to pay off balloon note ASAP or make minimum payments and invest the rest?,"Hey friends. A little background first:

I'm a 33yo single male sharing a house with my brother (he owns it, I maintain it instead of paying rent). I earn a 60k salary and recently purchased a rural property next to my brother's house. The property I bought is considered unimproved/undeveloped land (a couple of pole barns on the property, but no home). I have very good credit, but could only get a 5-year fixed (3.95%)/20 year balloon note since it's undeveloped. The sale price was $106,000 and I made a 20% down payment. I'd love to build a house on this property in a few years, but one thing at a time. FWIW, the property appraised at $148,000.

My initial plan was to pay this whole thing off in five years while I have the 3.95% fixed rate. Who knows where the interest rate will be in 2027 when I'd refinance the remaining balance of the loan. The minimum required payment is $511/mo. I've been paying $1700/mo in order to meet the 5-year goal I set. Of course, that's a sizeable chunk of my net pay. I don't have too many other expenses, so I thought I'd just bear the burden for five years and own the land free and clear.

I was talking to a neighbor of mine who's in his 70s, and he said that if he were as young as me, he'd stretch the payments out as long as possible and pay later with cheaper dollars. Meanwhile, he would invest the difference (about $1200/mo in this case) and let that money grow over that period.

I'm admittedly pretty green with all of this. This is my first major purchase. I have no debt besides this loan and a small car loan. I firmly believe in staying out of debt, which was the motivation for paying this off as soon as I could. Could you all help me understand the pros and cons of these two ideas?

So, what do you do during this time? Simple: accumulate more. More what? More blue chips. Bitcoin and Ethereum.                              

The worst crash I had ever seen happening with my own two eyes was March 2020. The reason I say that was the worst was because in 48 hours I saw bitcoin go from over 10k USD to under 4k. Covid had just set in. The U.S. economy started sinking, and it felt like everywhere you looked you were seeing the end of the world unfolding, especially in anything finance or investing related. At that point I had sold somewhere with bitcoin in the high 7k range. I literally thought, ""If this is the end of the world, Bitcoin might not do me much good."" The next day I was able to buy back the original position I had and pocket the remainder in cash while skeptically watching the market. If you had bought in at 3.7k then, you would be up nearly 10x today.                     

The case I am making here is, if bitcoin goes to 20-25k, that's the buying opportunity of a lifetime. I wouldn't be surprised to find new financial institutions getting in at that price either.

&gt;This is the three-chapter story of why that didn't happen, the story of the three Fed meetings that took place during the summer of 2008, whose much-anticipated transcripts **were finally released last week**.

Given that these are transcripts from meetings that happened in 2008, it seems they were release 6 years later. Is this standard practice?

My line of reasoning by asking this is that, these transcripts contain highly sensitive information that could very easily affect the mindset of investors, triggering some unwanted effects if released during a turmoil. So, if the FED decides to release them could be considered as the ""worst has passed"" and that they are OK in releasing this, a very bullish indicator IMHO.",finance,1651982014
CryptoCurrency,TERRA LUNA has dropped almost three times as much as the majors in the last two days. The risk to the UST peg is being exposed.,"Full disclosure. My position includes 2% LUNA. I intend to close out my positions once it passes $100. 


I've been trying to figure it out what happened over the last 24 hours through all the noise. And there has been an awful lot. I'm only minimally involved in TERRA as I don’t believe the peg works. The risk to destabilisation is much too high. It seems to convenient to be long term effective to me. 


So here is what I think has happened. Happy to be corrected and include additional details as more are discovered. But why has the value for LUNA plummeted at three times the rate of the other big coins. Near as I can tell...

Do Klown (DK) continued the stablecoin backing strategy by purchasing a stack more BTC. Either a major UST whale, or multiple smaller UST whales didn't like this and started closing their positions. 
Large withdrawals started on Anchor and left only $300m left in the liquidity pool before the BTC reserves will have to be used. And with BTC price dropping due the FED FUD, this increased selling pressure. 

This started a cascade against UST. Investors became concerned at the prospects of a UST depeg and this tanekd the price of the paired token LUNA. Many started swapping their UST for other stablecoins which further dropped LUNA price. Then Binance announced no fees on trades between stables which just increased fears that UST would soon depeg. 

TLDR: Whale(s) sold UST, low volume over weekends, BTC reserve purchase with falling price, investors scared of depeg, swapped to other stables, Binance announced temporary removal of fees swapping stables.",cryptocurrency,1651988597

economy,Naked Short Selling - The Truth Is Much Worse Than You Have Been Told,"*Written by James Stafford of OilPrice.com*

There is a massive threat to our capital markets, the free market in general, and fair dealings overall. And no, it’s not China. It’s a homegrown threat that everyone has been afraid to talk about. Until now.

Hordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.  They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.

The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.

It’s a global problem, but it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets, where naked short selling—the process of selling shares you don’t own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‘phantom’ shares—survives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.

This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it’s caused billions of dollars in damage.

Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.

In Canada alone, hundreds of billions of dollars have been vaporized from pension funds and regular, everyday Canadians because of this, according to Texas-based lawyer James W. Christian. Christian and his firm are heavy hitters in litigation related to stock manipulation and have prosecuted over 20 cases involving naked short selling and spoofing in the last 20 years.

*“Hundreds of billions have been stolen from everyday Canadians and Americans and pension funds alike, and this has jeopardized the integrity of Canada’s capital markets and the integral process of capital creation for entrepreneurs and job creation for the economy,”* Christian told Oilprice.com.

**The Dangerous Naked Short-Selling MO**

In order to \[legally\] sell a stock short, traders must first locate and secure a borrow against the shares they intend to sell. A broker who enters such a trade must have assurance that his client will make settlement.

While “long” sales mean the seller owns the stock, short sales can be either ""covered"" or ""naked."" A *covered short* means that the short seller has already “borrowed” or has located or arranged to borrow the shares when the short sale is made. Whereas, a *naked short* means the short seller is selling shares it doesn’t own and has made no arrangements to buy. The seller cannot cover or “settle” in this instance, which means they are selling “ghost” or “phantom” shares that simply do not exist without their action.

When you have the ability to sell an unlimited number of non-existent phantom shares in a publicly-traded company, you then have the power to destroy and manipulate the share price at your own will.

And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them. These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.

The funds behind this are hyper sophisticated and know all the rules and tricks needed to exploit the regulators to buy themselves time to cover their short positions. According to multiple accounts from traders, lawyers, and businesses who have become victims of the worst of the worst in this game, short-sellers sometimes manage to stay naked for months on end, in clear violation of even the most relaxed securities laws.

The short-sellers and funds who participate in this manipulation almost always finance undisclosed “short reports” which they research &amp; prepare in advance, before paying well-known short-selling groups to publish and market their reports (often without any form of disclosure) to broad audiences in order to further push the stock down artificially. There’s no doubt that these reports are intended to create maximum fear amongst retail investors and to push them to sell their shares as quickly as possible.

That is market manipulation. Plain and simple.

Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. After cratering the shorted company’s share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.

In addition to the foregoing madness, brokers are often complicit in these sorts of crimes through their booking of client shares as “long” when they are in fact “short”. This is where the practice moves from a regulatory gray area to conduct worthy of prison time.

Naked short selling was officially labeled illegal in the U.S. and Europe after the 2008/2009 financial crisis.

Making it illegal didn’t stop it from happening, however, because some of the more creative traders have discovered convenient gaps between paper and electronic trading systems, and they have taken advantage of those gaps to short stocks.

Still, it gets even more sinister.

According to Christian, “global working groups” coordinate their attacks on specifically targeted companies in a “Mafia-like” strategy.

Journalists are paid off, along with social media influencers and third-party research houses that are funded by what amounts to a conspiracy. Together, they collaborate to spread lies and negative narratives to destroy a stock.

At its most illegal, there is an insider-trading element that should enrage regulators. The MO is to infiltrate a company through disgruntled insiders or lawyers close to the company. These sources are used to obtain insider information that is then leaked to damage the company.

Often, these illegal transactions involve paying off “informants”, journalists, influencers, and “researchers” are difficult to trace because they are made from offshore accounts that are shut down once the deed is done.

Likewise, the “shorts” disguised as longs can be difficult to trace when the perpetrators have direct market access to trading systems. These trades are usually undetected until the trades fail or miss settlement.  At that point, the account will move the position to another broker-dealer and start the process all over again.

The collusion widens when brokers and financial institutions become complicit in purposefully mislabeling “shorts” as “longs”, sweeping the illegal transactions under the rug and off of regulatory radar.

“Spoofing” and “layering” have also become pervasive techniques to avoid regulator attention. Spoofing, as the name suggests, involves short sellers creating fake selling pressure on their targeted stocks to drive prices lower. They accomplish this by submitting fake offerings in “layers” at different prices to create a mirage.

Finally, these bad actors manage to skirt the settlement system, which is supposed to “clear” on what is called a T+2 Basis. That means that any failed trades must be bought or dealt with within 3 days. In other words, if you buy on Monday (your “T” or transaction day), it has to be settled by Wednesday.

Unfortunately, Canadian regulators have a hard time keeping up with this system, and failed trades are often left outstanding for much longer periods than T+2. These failing trades are constantly being traded to reset the settlement clock and move the failing trade to the back of the line. The failures of a centralized system…

According to Christian, it can be T+12 days before a failed trade is even brought to the attention of the IIROC (the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada)…

**Prime Brokers and Banks are Complicit**

This is one of Wall Street’s biggest profit center and fines levied against them are merely a minor cost of doing business.

Some banks are getting rich off of these naked short sellers. The profits off this kind of lending are tantalizing, indeed. Brokers are lending stocks they don’t own for massive profit and sizable bonuses.

This layer of what many have now called a “criminal organization” is the toughest for regulators to deal with, regardless of the illegal nature of these activities.

Prime brokers lend cash account shares that are absolutely not allowed to be lent. They lend them to short-sellers in order to facilitate them in settling their naked shorts.

It’s not that the regulators are in the dark on this. They are, in fact, handing out fines, left and right—both for illegal lending and for mismarking “shorts” and “longs” to evade regulatory scrutiny. The problem is that these fines pale in comparison to the profits earned through these activities.

And banks in Canada in particular are basically writing the rules themselves, recently making it easier (and legal) to lend out cash account shares.

Nor do law firms have clean hands. They help short sellers bankrupt targeted companies through court proceedings, a process that eventually leads to the disappearance of evidence of naked shorts on the bank books.

“How much has been stolen through this fraudulent system globally is anyone’s guess,” says Christian, “but the number begins with a ‘T’ (trillions).”

The list of fines for enabling and engaging in manipulative activity that destroys companies’ stock prices may seem to carry big numbers from the retail investor’s perspective, but they are not even close to being significant enough to deter such actions:

– The SEC charged Citigroup’s principal U.S. broker-deal subsidiary in 2011 with misleading investors about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tied to the U.S. housing market. Citigroup had bet against investors as the housing market showed signs of distress. The CDO defaulted only months later, causing severe losses for investors and a profit of $160 million (just in fees and trading profits). Citigroup paid $285 million to settle these SEC charges.

– In 2016, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. agreed to pay $15 million to settle SEC charges that its securities lending practices violated federal regulations. To wit: The SEC found that Goldman Sachs was mismarking logs and allowed customers to engage in short selling without determining whether the securities could reasonably be borrowed at settlement.

– In 2013, a Charles Schwab subsidiary was found liable by the SEC for a naked short-selling scheme and fined $8.2 million.

– The SEC charged two Merrill Lynch entities in 2015 with using “inaccurate data in the course of executing short sale orders”, fining them $11 million.

– And most recently, Canadian Cormark Securities Inc and two others came under the SEC’s radar. On December 21, SEC instituted cease and desist orders against Cormark. It also settled charges against Cormark and two other Canada-based broker deals for “providing incorrect order-making information that caused an executing broker’s repeated violations of Regulation SHO”. According to the SEC, Cormark and ITG Canada caused more than 200 sale orders from a single hedge fund, to the tune of more than $660 million between August 2016 and October 2017, to be mismarked as “long” when they were, in fact, “short”—a clear violation of Regulation SHO. Cormark agreed to pay a penalty of $800,000, while ITG Canada—one of the other broker-dealers charged—agreed to pay a penalty of $200,000. Charging and fining Cormark is only the tip of the iceberg. The real question is on whose behalf was Cormark making the naked short sells?

– In August 2020, Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) was fined $127 million over civil and criminal allegations in connection with its role in a massive price-manipulation scheme.

According to one Toronto-based Canadian trader who spoke to Oilprice.com on condition of anonymity, *“traders are the gatekeeper for the capital markets and they’re not doing a very good job because it’s lucrative to turn a blind eye.”* This game is set to end in the near future, and it is only a matter of time.

*“These traders are breaking a variety of regulations, and they are taking this risk on because of the size of the account,”* he said. *“They have a responsibility to turn these trades down. Whoever is doing this is breaking regulations \[for the short seller\] and they know he is not going to be able to make a settlement. As a gatekeeper, it is their regulatory responsibility to turn these trades away. Instead, they are breaking the law willfully and with full knowledge of what they are doing.”*

*“If you control the settlement system, you can do whatever you want,”* the source said. *“The compliance officers have no teeth because the banks are making big money. They over-lend the stocks; they lend from cash account shares to cover some of these fails … for instance, if there are 20 million shares they sold ‘long’, they can cover by borrowing from cash account shares.”*

**The Naked Truth**

In what he calls our “ominous financial reality”, Tom C.W. Lin, attorney at law, details how “millions of dollars can vanish in seconds, rogue actors can halt trading of billion-dollar companies, and trillion-dollar financial markets can be distorted with a simple click or a few lines of code”.

Every investor and every institution is at risk, writes Lin.

The naked truth is this: Investors stand no chance in the face of naked short sellers. It’s a game rigged in the favor of a sophisticated short cartel and Wall Street giants.

Now, with online trading making it easier to democratize trading, there are calls for regulators to make moves against these bad actors to ensure that North America’s capital markets remain protected, and retail investors are treated fairly.

The recent GameStop saga is retail fighting back against the shorting powers, and it’s a wonderful thing to see – but is it a futile punch or the start of something bigger? The positive take away from the events the past week is that the term “short selling” has been introduced to the public and will surely gather more scrutiny.

Washington is gearing up to get involved. That means that we can expect the full power of Washington, not just the regulators, to be thrown behind protecting the retail investors from insidious short sellers and the bankers and prime brokers who are profiting beyond belief from these manipulative schemes.

The pressure is mounting in Canada, too, where laxer rules have been a huge boon for manipulators. The US short cartel has preyed upon the Canadian markets for decades as they know the regulators rarely take action. It is truly the wild west.

Just over a year ago, McMillan published a lengthy report on the issue from the Canadian perspective, concluding that there are significant weaknesses in the regulatory regime.

While covered short-selling itself has undeniable benefits in providing liquidity and facilitating price discovery, and while the Canadian regulators’ hands-off approach has attracted many people to its capital markets, there are significant weaknesses that threaten to bring the whole house of cards down.

McMillan also noted that “the number of short campaigns in Canada is utterly disproportionate to the size of our capital markets when compared to the United States, the European Union, and Australia”.

Taking Wall Street’s side in this battle, Bloomberg notes that Wall Street has survived “numerous other attacks” over the centuries, “but the GameStop uprising could mark the end of an era for the public short”, suggesting that these actors are “long-vilified folks who try to root out corporate wrongdoing”.

Bloomberg even attempts to victimize Andrew Left’s Citron Research, which—amid all the chaos—has just announced that it has exited the short-selling game after two decades.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Short sellers, particularly the naked variety, are not helping police the markets and route out bad companies, as Bloomberg suggests. **Naked short sellers are not motivated by moral and ethical reasons, but by profit alone.** They attack good, but weak and vulnerable companies. **They are not the saviors of capital markets, but the destroyers.** Andrew Left may be a “casualty”, but he is not a victim. Nor likely are the hedge funds with whom he has been working.

In a petition initiated by Change.org, the petitioners urge the SEC and FINRA to investigate Left and Citron Research, noting: “While information Citron Research publishes are carefully selected and distributed in ways that do not break the law at first sight, the SEC and FINRA have overlooked the fact that Left and Citron gains are a result of distributing catalysts in an anticipation of substantial price changes due to public response in either panic, encouragement, or simply a catalyst action wave ride. Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic shortly after taking a trading position so they and their clients can make the most amount of financial gains at the expense of regular investors.”

On January 25th, the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce published its final report for Ontario’s Minister of Finance, noting that while naked short selling has been illegal in the United States since 2008, it remains a legal loophole in Canada. The task force is recommending that the Ministry ban this practice that allows for the short-selling of tradable assets without first borrowing the security.

The National Coalition Against Naked Short Selling – Failing to Deliver Securities (NCANS), which takes pains to emphasize that is not in any way against short-selling, notes: “Naked short-selling transfers the risk exposure and the hedging expense of the derivatives market makers onto the backs of equity investors, without any corresponding benefit to them. This is fundamentally unfair, and must stop.”

CryptoCurrency,Tread carefully: All speculative assets are going to go through a harsh winter,"Not to sound to pessimistic, but I believe we are in a time where crypto itself is not going through bull and bear markets independent of the stock market. Crypto has gotten to the point where many people do look at it as a legitimate speculative investment rather than just a bunch of retail investors gambling. 

I’ve always seen crypto projects very similarly to small cap companies that are just starting out and therefore have a lot of room to grow. These companies essentially are allowing everyday retail investors to invest into start ups that normally wouldn’t be available to you until they IPO’d. this means that they are way more risky and also have way more potential to gain in value since you can get in at the start. 

These companies have benefitted from the same massive amount of cash flowing into the stock market that the regular stocks have. Tech companies for years have been very similar to crypto companies just a bit less volatile considering that they are already established and have less room to grow. They are also more heavily stabilized by the funds that manage large percentages of the companies. When crypto companies are much more individualized with either retail investors or single whales, it leads to much more volatility. 

With interest rates going up, speculation is sure to go down as free cash becomes less and less in abundance. People will flow more to stable, less volatile investment. Even if crypto does huge things it may not result in the huge spikes that we are used to. 

Will it be a harsh winter like what we saw a few years ago? Probably not. But at the same time I don’t think the huge spikes up will be as prominent. This would mean it could take a very long time for your investments to recover. Even several years. 

I have no plans to sell so I’m going to just watch and buy here and there while I try to figure out just how much rising interest rates is going to impact the market as a whole. These are certainly good prices relative to a year ago, but I’ve seen things get a whole hell of a lot worse before they got better too.

Bitcoin sharks gobble up BTC when when no one wants it. Kinda like March / April 2020 when we saw the sickness breakout. Fear took over and people panicked. They dumped their satoshis and sharks gobbled them up. 

When the sharks were ready to take profits of more than 10x in under a year, there was a herd of people willing to give them money. 

All they had to do was have their buddies make tweets (Elon), write a few articles, and publish news stories, and voila! The herd arrives. 

A herd of new bitcoiners arrived while being unaware of the fact that there’s never been a single instance in history where the masses have become rich together. It literally cannot happen. In the markets, there are buyers and sellers.

As the herd sees the value of their BTC drop, they become pseudo maximalists. They say “I’m HODLing forever!” Maybe they won’t hold forever, but they definitely won’t be selling for a profit either.

I don’t blame them. I’d hold forever too... unless a perfect storm of economic catastrophes forced me to part ways with my satoshis. Inflation. Job loss. Nosebleed interest rates. Etc. 

We won’t see a meteoric rise in BTC until most of the masses who flooded in have closed their positions.

I’ll be right there ready to buy from the final exhausted seller. Like a shark would do.

investing,BDCs and effects of recession,"All,

With rising interest rates, BDCs are going to be in luck as loans are one of their major services. At the same time, we are probably at the beginning of a recession as well. How would this affect BDCs? Would it balance out the gains from increasing interest rates or would it not lead to much change?",finance,1652018930
CryptoCurrency,What is your current portfolio allocation?,"Due to the macroeconomic events (I.e. Ukraine war, high inflation, feds being hawkish, supply chain issue, etc.), I would say we are currently in a bear market and I’m sure many others share similar sentiment. I understand that the market is currently in “risk off” mode.

They say money is made during bull markets, but true generational wealth is made during bear markets. With that said, I am curious to see other peoples’ portfolio and allocation in the current state of the market.

What is your current portfolio like?

\-------------

I haven't posted in a while due to personal circumstances but I've been reading along regularly in the daily posts and sharing in all your tales of joy and suffering.

I want to put forward a random epic rant about some stuff that's in my mind currently. This isn't really structured, just, what comes to mind as I think about the market today, thoughts circulating around the last month or two. Maybe someone will find it interesting.

# Time &amp; Experience

Keep in mind, I'm a much older investor than most of you, that doesn't make me a better investor (in fact, the last 18 months, and the period from 2015-2020 have been a shit time to be a bear!), but it means I've lived through stuff that is just old tales in the history books for you.

Part of that is about understanding the experience of loss, part of it is expanding your idea of what's possible. I mean, if I built a time machine, went back and told you in November, ""Netflix will fall from $700 to $250 within months, and yet, no one will be rushing to buy it, in fact it will then keep dropping some more the next day"", you would have laughed at me a lot and pointed out how Squid Game was currently the most popular show in the world and netflix was an amazing growth stock with limitless potential. That was just six months ago, when people lived in that version of reality. Inflation was high then, but it was 'transitional', rates were 0%, there was no need for rate rises, the housing market was continuing up at blistering pace. Mortgage rates in the USA were 2.5% for a 30 year loan. Europe was at peace. Picking up the paper, no one was discussing where a nuke might land. Delta was a pain in the butt but we seemed to be getting finally through the worst of covid, at the start of november, omicron was barely on the radar, omicron B2, XE, 98, ME, 2000, or Omicron 11 Professional Edition didn't even exist. That was just six months ago!

If that much can change in the last six months, imagine what it will look like six months in the future, just try to imagine! It's like the blind spot in your field of vision. Your instincts will say 'pretty much the same as today, perhaps a linear extension of the trends we see today'. But actually we could be really very far from that. There could be a major earthquake somewhere, war could get a LOT worse, new disease can show up, rates might have to rise above inflation to control it, inflation could *keep* rising rapidly, there could be a currency crisis, a crypto wipeout, a new technology might be discovered (like MRNA vaccines) that suddenly and rapidly changes the game for humanity. The 'mood' of the world might change, grow more gloomy, the markets may crash through the floor to a degree that seems as impossible to you today, just as impossible as Netflix $220, or tens of thousands of US military volunteers travelling to fight for the future of Ukrainian democracy against the real threat of Russian nukes would have seemed to you in November 2021. Nonetheless, things happen, totally regardless of what we each believe is the range of possible futures. Our personal models of the future fail again and again, yet we each retain absolute confidence in them somehow and always think 'the next 6 months will be mostly just like today, except maybe some musician will get married or die or something'. If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans, or about your views on the future.

# A lot of people don't even know themselves yet

You can train soldiers for years but they won't know till they're in combat what combat actually feels like, or how they'll react to it. Similarly, you could read this forum all day, read buffett's letters, read AMD's earnings report, read books, watch youtubes or tiktoks or whatever, trade all you like in a happy, upwards, safe market. But there's literally nothing that will prepare you for the cold hard ninja-nut-punch when you realise 80% of your money is just... gone. It isn't coming back. It's too late. You've fucked it up. You *can't* unfuck it. A decade or two of grind in a shit job you hate is the only way back. I speak from experience. I've been there. It permanently changed how I invest and made me a hyper-cautious scaredy-bear for life. Making money in a euphoric bubble vs losing money in a brutal crash, is like the difference between having fun in the bedroom with someone, vs having a baby burst out so forcefully and painfully that the entire lower body instantly rips open all the way round from front to back. Experience gained from one is not a teacher for the other.

Like the moment your doctor tells you that you have cancer. I've been there. Like the moment a one-night-stand texts you she's pregnant and not getting an abortion, (thankfully avoided this one). You can't know who you are, till you're actually standing there experiencing it. Living in a new type of experience. No amount of bookwork or pre-thought or imagination will show you who'll you be in that moment. That feeling of 'hmmm... shit.' you feel looking at the market dumping today or netflix losing 36% and then losing so more %s after that.... this is not the end, it is only barely the *beginning* of the experience you're going to have one day, and probably very soon. It is the pre-appetiser nibble, not even the appetiser, certainly not the main course. I'm afraid to say, new investors, that you are only seeing the oh-shit seagull balanced on the tip of the oh-shit iceberg through your telescope. By 'new investors' I mean anyone who joined the market in the last 22 years.

# 22 years??? wtf?

Yes. 22 years. That's when the last proper secular bear market began. 2018 and 2020 were corrections. Technically, 2020 qualified as a bear by depth of crash, but it was not a real bear market. 2008 was a proper decent bear market, but not the start of a secular bear, just a piece of an existing one. A secular bear is when you put your money in and don't see those levels again for over a decade. A secular bear is a total nightmare for anyone who's not a value investor (because value investors don't really care much about the market's opinion anyway). 2000 qualifies, because it took til 2015 for most QQQ / SP500 investors to get back what they put in. Corrections and crashes are about sudden, painful losses, but you can easily just take a nap and wait them out unless you trade options (very common now, not common in the past). We used to see 10% corrections almost every year, sometimes several, but all the easy money and mania and euphoria has made all dips shallow in the last 6 years excluding Dec 2018 and Mar 2020.

Bear markets are about brutal losses, they drive margin-users out of the market and give everyone else a big fright / buying opportunity for a year or two.

But secular bears? Holy fuck. Secular bears are just a different game. Secular bears, you wait a month, you wait a year, you wait 3 years, you wait 5 years. Jesus christ I'm still down 50%!. You wait 10 years, oh my god I'm still down. You wait 15-20 years, oh jesus, finally! finally! I can sell and get my money back! Secular bears are when you write a letter to yourself reminding future you of why Chewy, Rivian or GME truly is an amazing company and definitely not to sell it, then 8 years later, you find the letter in a box in the attic (having long since lost interest in investing), you read it, laugh a little, cry a lot, and then you either burn the letter or frame it.

If your child is born the very first day of the start of a secular bear market, your first grandchild may be getting born by the time you get your money back out from the market. Look at the 1930-&gt;1950s secular bear for example. Secular bears make society stop talking about stock investing completely, it becomes taboo at first, then just, not interesting. No one cares. We are very far away from that stage of the market!

But from a CAPE 40 (January), that's what you'd expect to see in the next 10 years, from all the historical data, you should expect a secular bear to be beginning. Rates rising, QT, inflation, supply/demand crisis, labour costs rising, epic bubbles in housing, bonds, crypto, stocks, growth going ex-growth, hype losing it's hype - sorry folks, but we are going straight towards a secular bear whether you want it or not. It's just how it is. Ask yourself, how many people do you know that are actually prepared emotionally and financially for multiple years of grinding losses, like 2000 or 2008? For decades of stagnation? Like 2000-2015 and 1930-1950s?

Look up the DJIA from 1934-1950. Look it up from 1966 to 1982. Look it up from 2000 to 2016. This 'secular bear' thing is not an imaginary concept. It comes around every few decades, and it ruins the lives of all the investors who hate history books.

Your great-grandparents lived through several secular bears, your grandparents too, your parents too. It's just part of the human experience. Now, it is probably going to be your turn to experience your first secular bear. Whatever happens next, it will not be like the fun and games of the last 24 months, I assure you.

# The euphoria is clearly starting to fade.

We're now several months since a new all-time high in the indices was last reached. The emotions that replace euphoria aren't 'hope' or 'resoluteness', they're 'boredom', 'frustration', 'despair'. The emotions that follow after those ones are 'caution', 'panic', 'fear'.

Long-term market price comes from company value, but short-term it comes from waves of people changing from buyers to holders, holders to sellers or vice versa. An imbalance between people wanting to buy or sell is the force that creates bubbles and crashes. And we're seeing a change of balance taking place currently, though it comes in waves, as people flip-flop back to greed one week, fear the next. But long-term, the euphoria is clearly draining away. The thing about euphoria is that when you lose it, it doesn't quickly come back. The thing about fear is, when you get it, it doesn't quickly go away.

We'll eventually pass through 'selling from caution', 'selling from boredom', 'selling from fear', and will then reach 'forced selling'. Where people just have to close positions because they were running on margin, or they put more into the stockmarket than was wise and have to meet some household expenses, or whatever. You'll recognise it because *everything* goes down. Even safe-haven stocks losing 5%. People get to the point they simply can't manage the emotional pain caused by seeing losses after losses. Unfortunately (for bulls), the more that bulls convert to bears (or are forcibly converted by their broker or wife/husband), the less fun it is to be a bull going forward for years to come. As a classical-value investor, I hate to say it, but short &amp; long-term momentum is a real effect, and it's driven by human psychology.

# The fall is still beginning

With hype stocks, memes, spacs etc, we may see a 2000 style market overvaluation. I have a 'pick the right meme stock!' book on my bookshelf from 2000, telling you the hot stocks to buy. It's quite amusing. We didn't call them meme stocks then, just 'internet stocks' or 'dotcoms'. And we didn't have Buttcorn, we had Flooz. But you get the idea.

With an overpriced housing market, we see 2008 style market overvaluation, 'flipping' etc.

With bonds priced all the way down to &lt;1% rates on the 30y not long ago, we saw a new type of market overvaluation, which is now rapidly correcting.

All of which coincided with short rates &amp; QE being the driving factors. Now both of these are in reverse. Let's suppose we get only one of those bubbles turning to a crash, and not all three running together.

2000-2002: We saw the nasdaq decline 78%. Currently, it's only declined 18%.

**In other words, as of today, April 21st, we're just 1/8th of the way to replaying the last tech hype bubble drop.**

18% drop from peak -&gt; 82% left

18% drop from there -&gt; .82 x .82 = 67% left

18% drop again -&gt; 55% left

18% drop again -&gt; 45% left

18% drop again -&gt; 37% left

18% drop again -&gt; 30% left

18% drop again -&gt; 25% left

18% drop again -&gt; 20% left

So, we would need to see another 7 similar dumps of 18% in the nasdaq like the one from November 2021 peak to today, in addition to the drops already happened, to replay the 2000-2002 tech/hype/meme crash. Stop and think about that for a moment if you're investing in these stocks. The 'bummer' feeling you have today is 1/8 of what you may have by the end. You will go through this again, and again, and still not even be halfway through the suffering.

# Nah it won't happen

Now you will all have lots of reasons why 'that can't happen again, this time is different' etc. Copium is a real psychological effect, read up on 'the five stages of grief bargaining' etc. But load up the share price charts for your favourite memes and scroll back to 2015-2016.

Let's take netflix as an example. Netflix in 2012 was $7. In 2015, $47. 2016? $85. And that was *without* a market crash backdrop, and without competition, without 'the end of customer growth'. That was a company with a basic perfect future ahead, lots of customers to be discovered, that was how it was priced in a market not facing QT and rate rises, tax rises, rising labour costs, etc. None of which is true any more.

The idea of netflix dropping another, say, 33% from here shouldn't seem unreasonable. $150 netflix would put it on a PER equal to the long-term US average for ex-growth, non-monopoly companies around PER 15. Also sort of matches the 2000 dotcom price drop. Besides, a further 33% drop in netflix shouldn't seem THAT weird when we literally had a 36% drop happen out of nowhere literally 2 days ago.

Or how about AMD? The last few years it enjoyed a lack of performance competition from intel. Now, it's competing with Apple, with Amazon/Google data warehouse custom chips, it's competing with nvidia in graphics (who are winning), and intel is winning on both price and performance again in the x86 consumer market. The only place AMD are still hanging on is x86 server performance, and not for long. 3D chips have not been the outrageous victory hoped for this year either.

AMD is in a technologically inferior and substantially financially weaker position than Intel. We should expect their share PERs to be much closer together. Intel's PER is about 10-13 (depending on where earnings come in soon). Even viewing AMD as 'going ex hyper-growth, exiting the glory years, room to still grow share' you'd maybe put it on a 15-18 PER.

Let's take the highest analyst forward earnings estimate for 2022 and price that with a 15 PER, higher than intels. ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amd/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amd/earnings)). That's 3.78 earnings x 15 per = 56.7$. That's not even crash pricing. That's pricing for 'return to normality'. If we do the 'nasdaq dumped 78% in the last tech crash' assumption and apply to AMD's peak price, we get $164 peak, x 0.22 = $36. Even in the last 12 months, AMD was priced at $72.50. In 2020, &lt;$40.

So whichever point of view you take, there's a lot of air still underneath these prices potentially.

And yet AMD and Netflix are about as good as it gets for overall company quality, duopoly, and potential growth among the tech hype meme bubble darlings. If AMD and netflix holders may have heavy bags for years to come, what happens to all the purely-meme crap holders?

Can it happen? Sure it can. Look at the Intel, Microsoft share prices between 2000 to 2015, Cisco etc. These were the technology hype darlings of the time. It really happens. It can take literally 20+ years to get your money back out again.

# Mortgage rates.

US mortgage rates were around 2.5% for 30 years merely 4 months ago.

Recently they've been over 6%. If you assume most people 'buy as much house as they can afford for a monthly payment', then that equates to every $500k house becoming a $400k house, even absent a recession or any other factors like change of housebuyer sentiment in the market. It seems to me a lot of people haven't figured this out. [r/rebubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/rebubble/) has more.

Likewise, in Australia and Canada, did you know that most mortgages are adjustible rate (around 90% in both cases, though less among the most recent mortgages). In the past, short-rates had to rise above inflation to control inflation, eg over 10% rates. Can you imagine what these two countries will look like with 10% rates? Personally, I surely would not be investing in Australian or Canadian banks right now.

Of course, banks make more money long-term when rates are high, usually, but they tend to suffer crippling short-term losses during the period of 'rates becoming high' beforehand. It's like the difference between simply having a muscular physique and the pain you have to go through to get there at first. Hence, we see banks making significantly increased loss provisions currently. I expect to see bank stocks get slammed pretty hard this year, even more than we've seen already. JPM &amp; BAC are about as good as it gets globally for banking, but my price target on JPM for example is around $90, which is more in line with historical lows for the stock given growth over the years. For BAC I'd struggle to persuade myself to pay above $20-25. The thing is, I remember just how bad it got in the 2008 crash for banks. Last time around I saw Citigroup drop 99% from peak at one point, in 2008. Which wasn't the worst of it. I watched half the banking sector completely go out of business in months here. I saw major international banks dropping 40% off their share price in minutes on no news, in 2008, and that wasn't during the start of the crash when prices were sky high, that was late on, prices already low as we got deeper into credit markets locking up.

# General bad backdrop, potential risks

Russia/Ukraine, Covid, are not going to make inflation and supply/demand problems go away. They're not going to lower taxes or energy/food costs. Russia is set to formally default on its debt around 4th May, 30 days after the payments were due (Star wars day! May the fourth be with you!). If Putin decides to test the 'escalate to de-escalate' (aka total insanity) theory, and starts throwing nukes around to show off, the market is not going to rally up on that.

We saw several major new strains of covid in the last two years. Alpha was 'tougher', Delta was 'tougher', and Omicron unlocked the 'spread to the planet in 2 months' feature. Consider original SARS in 2000 and the death rate it had, that's how bad this could get with a coronavirus -we know, because it already did!

If we get a strain of omicron with the lethality of SARS-2000, the market is gonna have a bad time. is it priced in? no. Meanwhile: plenty of countries looking at hyperinflation (south america, turkey, russia). Meanwhile: plenty of countries looking at stupidly priced housing markets due to collapse (Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, much of Europe, China, Taiwan...).

Remember Evergrande from last year, the Chinese property company with the biggest debts of any company on the planet? That hasn't gone away! People are just ignoring it as it slowly plays out. There's just a lot of really bad shit playing out in the background and not a lot of good shit to balance it out.

Though I'll admit: seeing Europe, USA, UK, Japan, Australia, etc coming together re: Russia/Ukraine? That's encouraging! That bodes well for the future, the more these important countries work together and try to do the right thing even when it's costly to do so. Democracy bros gotta be true bros, because there's a lot of bad bros out there. Oh and while it's in my mind, though I've been a bit dismayed at the state of the USA in the last decade, I have to say, you guys are certainly doing some great things lately in helping Ukraine defend itself. Nice one!

# The dollar is probably overvalued and if it weakens, inflation will go even higher in the USA.

There is an idea in the currency markets that real rates impact currency value. Assuming two countries were of similar attractiveness, you'd be better investing in the one giving the most return on your capital after taxes &amp; inflation. Yet real rates in the USA are awful just now! The dollar is completely mispriced in my view. Having said that, short term it will probably continue to strengthen for the simple reason that 'in times of crisis, capital flees to perceived safety'. i.e. in the short term, in a crisis, 'return of capital' becomes more important than 'return on capital'. But long term? Ouch.

One of the problem of investing in US value stocks is that value stocks take typically years to play out, and in that timeframe you are maybe looking at a large loss on an overvalued currency. It might not even be possible to make money as a value investor outside the USA just now because of currency effects, unless you have a currency hedge. US investors may not care, but europoors should beware. This is already almost the worst time in 20 years for a european to be buying dollars. Check out the EURUSD rate on a 20 year chart. Yikes.

# Crypto

I was reading that young people nowadays prefer buying crypto to stocks or gold as a long term investment. e.g. [https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/investing/india-cryptocurrency-investing-future-hnk-intl/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/investing/india-cryptocurrency-investing-future-hnk-intl/index.html)

Let's be real. Somewhere between 98 and 100% of crypto coins are completely, hopelessly worthless. Probably 100%. It's like religion when you're an atheist: the reason I don't believe in *your* god, is probably the same as the reason you don't believe in 1000 other religion's gods. No special exceptions for your favourite crypto, sorry.

Considering e.g. Tether, I can't help but think the best epic-scale rugpull is still to come. People are only in crypto for the hope of rapid, massive gains yet they pretend it's 'about to be adopted as money'. It ain't happening guys. It's been 12 years now since Buttcorn came along and no one is using it as money.

Even *you* don't really use it as money. And if it ever did start acting like money, it won't produce 'gains'. If it produces 'gains', it can't be used as money. That's the thing about money; if it becomes an asset it stops being money. Even if crypto WAS money - and it's not, specifically because there's no tax system to physically enforce continual demand, and tax systems are what makes money-like into money - 'bad money drives out good', that's Gresham's law. The only thing keeping the crypto game going is the warm oxytocin glow of the bubbles, mania, euphoria in everything, the low rates.

Wait till you can't pay to keep the heating on in winter. Wait till you can't afford fuel for your car to get to work. Wait till the bank sends their final demand for payment. Then you'll find out who's a HODLer, who 'believes in the crypto dream'.

# Repent, ye bulls!

It's never to late to realise you have possibly fucked up and decide to become a bear or a kangaroo. Times change; models of investing that worked in the past may not work in the future and you won't be warned when the change is happening, when you are entering dangerous waters, when the tornado is about to arrive. Underwater caves are filled with the skeletons of skilled open-water divers. \[1\]

Remember, you don't need to always be in the market. It's OK to hold cash for a while, even with inflation devaluing it. Just ask any netflix shareholder.

Look at the 1970s, I think it might be a good model for what comes next. Sure, 8-10% inflation. But the stock market was a kangaroo market regardless, you could trade in and out of stocks/cash every few months that entire decade and still do far better than anyone who held only-cash or only-stocks the entire period.

\[1\] the film version of Ender's Game is awful, but there is one scene that is good, watch the scene where Ender meets Mazer Rackham. You are Ender, the market is Mazer Rackham.

Well I hope someone found this interesting. If it made you very annoyed, you should probably reflect on why that is, it probably says more about you and the risks you're taking, than it does about this post.

I wish all of you good luck because, to be blunt, we're all going to need it, me included. Thankfully there are still niches in the market where the tired investor can find peace and comfort, rare areas of well-priced shares with OK growth potential and decent economic prospects.

I'm not going to tell you where they are, because I spend hours every day looking for them, and lately, it's been like finding an oasis in the desert when I find some. But times change, hopefully in a few months, we will see the rains arrive and the desert bloom, and the bears and kangaroos and value investors can all dance together with joy in a beautiful paradise of good stocks at good prices. Talking of deserts...

# I met a traveller from an antique land,

# Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

# Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,

# Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

# And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

# Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

# Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

# The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;

# And on the pedestal, these words appear:

# My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;

# Look on my Netflix 500C gains, ye Mighty, and despair!

# Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

# Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

personalfinance,Better to sell house and downsize or get Reverse Mortgage?,"Scenario: a retiree depletes a 401K before death, has expenditures that exceed social security payments, but has a home that is fully paid off. The priority is to generate cash flow for the retiree, not optimize for inheritance.

The most straight forward solution is to sell the house and downsize, or rent, and pocket the difference as cash.

An alternative is a reverse mortgage. The lender will give somewhere less than 50% of the equity as cash, and upon death the house will be sold and the lender paid back (any difference would go to the estate). I suppose there are different styles of reverse mortgages, such as a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, or a monthly payout at a variable rate. Apparently the monthly payout will continue until death, even if the retiree ends up living for a very long time and the bank starts to lose money.

Does anyone prefer one of these two routes, or perhaps a different route, for handling this type of scenario?",finance,1652024118
Bitcoin,Should Bitcoin really be considered an “asset”?,"Or any cryptocurrency for that matter. They are supposed to be compared to fiat currency and have advantages over them, but nobody is seriously hoarding USD, they are holding interest bearing assets. Crypto shouldn’t be expected or even seen to be an asset increasing in value, especially not so rapidly. 

Experts have studied monetary policy for many decades and have basically agreed that you need a low level of inflation for a currency to actually work and not encourage hoarding/hodling. Deflation, aka increasing value, is how you get japans problems, and it not a good thing.

&gt;“Credible forward guidance means market interest rates have increased substantially in advance of tangible Fed action,” Bullard said in remarks prepared for a conference organized by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. “This provides another definition of ‘behind the curve,’ and the Fed is not as far behind based on this definition.”

 

&gt;Waller, who was previously head of research at the St. Louis Fed, made a similar point, arguing that a shift in Fed rhetoric led investors in financial markets to start pricing in rate increases in September, leading to a rise in 2-year Treasury yields that he estimated were equivalent to two quarter-point rate increases by the central bank.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When looked at this way, how far behind the curve could we have possibly been if, using forward guidance, one views rate hikes effectively beginning in September 2021?” he said.

&amp;#x200B;

As of today, US 10 Year Treasuries rate is sitting at 3.14. From what I know, and please correct me if I'm wrong, QE is done to lower interest rates in longer-term securities, such as the 10-year and mortgage-backed securities.

But just like Bullard said, thanks to the forward guidance, even before QT even started market has almost already priced in all the upcoming rate hikes and tightening already, and we are currently sitting at a quite high (compared to the year before) interest rates and the effect is already clear on mortgage rates etc. I see lots of comments around here on how we are ""just beginning"" on tightening, and how ""QT haven't even started yet"" and when the rates are at 2-3% we are going to see much more decline etc. But aren't we at those rates already thanks to the forward guidance?  Am I missing something, or are we already in this high-interest rate environment and we should start seeing its effects soon?",finance,1652024479
investing,If the Fed is starting QT (quantitative tightening) does that mean M2 money supply will go down?,"M2 money supply is shown as M2SL on Tradingview - this is a perfect geometric curve that never goes down.

So even if the Fed does QT, wont overall money supply still increase as it always has? And therefore over the long term liquidity will still increase and risk assets go up?

stocks,The fear is becoming overwhelming,"""Don't fight the Fed"".

I'm sure we've all heard this multiple times in the past 10+ years. Whenever the market grinded higher, despite whatever had caused it to go down initially, people would say ""Don't fight the Fed.""

Now, the Fed is reversing its easy money policy, raising interest rates, and starting QT. So if the logic remains the same, should we not fight the Fed? Instead of buy the dips, it seems like we should sell the rips.

The market environment is completely different from the past decade+. For the first time in a long, long time, we have inflation that isn't going away.

1. The war in Ukraine is exacerbating food and fuel inflation. Even if the war stops tomorrow, inflation won't just magically go down. It will take months to play out.
2. Supply chains are still messed up. China has locked down major cities like Shanghai, and their 0 tolerance policy on Covid doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. This is also worsening the inflation issue.
3. The Fed has no choice but to raise interest rates. The economy is still ""strong"" and unemployment is low, so they will keep raising until something changes.
4. Beyond raising interest rates, they are also starting QT, effectively sucking money out of the system (the opposite of QE).

We haven't had a situation like this before. ""This time is different"". The fear is palpable, and I know many people don't know what to do right now. I'm not sure how this situation reverses itself any time soon. There's too much contagion in financial markets.

Is this the start of a secular bear market like we saw from 1966 - 1982, or 2000 - 2009? How does this situation get better from here? I'm just not seeing it.

**EDIT:** I would also like to add, I am a firm believer that the stock market has an intrinsic value, and it can go up without the Fed printing money or setting interest rates lower. The problem is, without Fed intervention, I don't see why P/E ratio's should be higher than 15x on the S&amp;P (Assuming interest rates above 3% - which the 10Y is already at). This is the historical average. 

For 2022, EPS estimates for the S&amp;P this year are around 240. So 240 x 15 P/E = S&amp;P 3600. This is assuming no recession. If we get a recession and EPS comes in at 200, then we could easily be looking at S&amp;P 3000 or lower.",finance,1652026381

CryptoCurrency,"So, we all know the Hawkish comments from the Fed this week didn’t help, but there is some good news: institutional withdrawals are less than they were back in January.","Coinshares have been tracking institutional inflows and outflows for some time – in multiple cryptocurrencies. Back in early January when many believed the crypto world was about to capitulate, institutional outflows reached $467 million – almost half a billion dollars – in that first month of the year. Yet just a few weeks later BTC was back up and slowly retraced to the mid-forties before the first Fed rate hike.

So far in the past few weeks, those same institutions have pulled $339 million out of exchange-traded funds and institutional holdings, eg Grayscale, etc. Given that the Fed has pretty much confirmed at least another two 0.5% rate hikes before the Summer, the sale pressure we’re seeing now is likely to stabilise rather than deepen as the macroeconomic situation becomes clearer and the CPI figures are released this Wednesday. There is still a LOT of economic uncertainty, but US job figures are healthy and although we might see a brief (18 month) recession, the economic outlook in a post-COVID world is positive in the medium term. Global trade and travel is slowly normalising and governments have made a clear decision to act early against inflation, removing a lot of uncertainty about the tapering measures that are going to be taken.

Yes, a LOT of the liquidity that was pumped into the markets by the Fed since 2020 is slowly being removed and that’s why institutional moves out of crypto and into other assets and cash liquidity should be seen for what it is: preparation for a lower entry point. When that moment arrives (likely circa $30K), we’re going to see the same reversal we saw back at the end of January going into February ($36/37K to the $44/45K).

CryptoCurrency,"Benjamin Cowen himself may have abandoned his ""Lenghtning cycles"" theory but the evidence is still staggering and a part of it is proven to 100%.","As we know today Benjamin Cowen himself has said the Lenghtning cycles theory to be invalid, as he now officially sees that Crypto has entered a bear market and even if it ends in a month it will still feel like a new cycle afterwards. The Lenghtning Cycles theory is representing the case that each Crypto cycle is getting longer and longer while with returns going lower and lower.

The latter part of it, diminishing returns is actually proven to be true even by Ben Cowen himself. It's clear that even if you look over the past cycles with the ""4-years cycle"" theory the returns has been going lower each time. Obviously we still did like 10x in this cycle and will probably do at least 2x in the next one too. But the trend is still clear.

With one part of it proven I'm still confident that the theory is not invalid but needs some adjustments as all do and has some limits.

#The Limits:

Just as with every theory and every rule, there are exceptions. The Lenghtning cycles theory does not have any real parameter the cycles get longer on. But it seems to be ~400 days each time. That would put this cycle too at about Q1/Q2 2023. So why do we have a bear market then? 

Well the current situation should be seen as an exception. No one call tell that the current macro economic outlook is not highly extraordinary. We are having a major geopolitical conflict with a ""super power"" directly involved in it and others in the background. We have the FED being too late to fight inflation, we have Covid still out there and now even ravaging on supply chains. 

We are in an extraordinary situation right now. And extraordinary times require extraordinary views, we can not simply invalid a whole theory with that much evidence just because of one extraordinary situation. 



PS: It's a pretty long read, I'm sorry but as a person who has been very confident with Lenghtning cycles and now seeing one of the first persons for it aboard it, I had to show a bit of my emotions.",cryptocurrency,1652030945

personalfinance,Would it be a bad idea to move out if I'm currently a co-signer with my parents home?,"For context, every year my relationship with my parents have just been dwindling because of the constant fights between them two over the dumbest things ever and I always have to intervene anytime I'm at home. I'm really getting sick of it and am wanting to just live alone elsewhere and not deal with them anymore. My job is offering a relocation in a new state where I could afford my own home, but I dont know if its a good idea to just plunge on this decision if I'm a co-signer with our current home as I dont want to fly back and forth because they need my physical presence for documents needing to be signed.

My parents bought our current home in the late 2000s and refinanced about 5 years ago with my name on it. At the time I was a new hire at my current job for a year and a half making $35K with room for salary increases and my dad wanted to refi to get a lower interest rate.

My dad had given me a choice to make at that point:

Either co-sign with them or get kicked out of the house. I had until the next meeting with the realtor to decide.

I was still a new hire and apartments in the area went over $2.5-$3K/mo for a studio, so I had no choice but to co-sign and pay them $1K/mo for rent.

Fast forward to 5 years later and I'm making $60K now with a relocation offer keeping the same salary and still have room for salary increases. After flying out there to check the city out during my vacation and not worry about whats happening at home, I'd have to say that it was the first time I actually felt FREE in my entire life even though all I was doing was driving around the city alone and talking to potential new co-workers.

My parents are retiring soon and I know my dad wont be able to pay for the house himself, but I want to force his card into selling the home so he can go back to his home country and enjoy his retirement there since he talks about it after every argument.

stocks,Simple table showing why it may be better to cut your losses early,"Given recent market turmoil, seeing lots of posts and comments saying  words to the effect of ""share X has gone down 50% - it's a great time to get back in"" or ""it's already down 50%, I may as well hold on"".  I'm sure most are already aware of the math, but sometimes seeing the percentage recoveries needed in black and white can give a pause for thought before diving backing.

Not saying don't buy back in or DCA down etc - I certainly will be for some index ETFs.  Just don't do it on a whim!  Look at the percentage recovery needed and ask yourself whether in the current economic and political environment, is it likely in the time frame you are  looking at.  Equally, could it get worse!

For what its worth, I think the central banks cannot raise interest rates like they are implying and need to simply due to the amount of debt they have allowed to accumulate( and encouraged people to accumulate  at all levels of society - both corporate and individual ). 

If you bought a share at a nominal price of 100 and have already suffered a 50% loss.   Mentally, you may be sanguine about losing another 10 or 20, but check the percentage recovery needed to get you back to break even and see if you are still sanguine about it.

	Crocs is a public company that started as a manufacturer and distributor of shoes. Crocs was founded in 2002 by George Boedecker, Lyndon Hanson, and Scott Seamans. When on a vacation together, the three guys found out about these shoes that were produced by a Canadian company. They bought the IP for the shoe and redesigned it creating the well-known Clogs design, and started the Crocs company.
	Crocs has a broad portfolio that is mostly constituted of shoes made from Crocslite material to provide a lightweight, comfortable, and odor-resistant pair of shoes. Crocs’ market is segmented based mostly on characteristics like style, casual, active, and core. Crocs also deal in accessories that complement its products and are a key part of its brand image.
	Many know Crocs for its “unique” look which allowed for it to prosper in the late 2000s. As the Great Financial Crisis and the subsequent recession happened, many people started cutting their spending back. Casual footwear was hurt immensely with many people needing money to pay rent and other necessities.
	As spending picked up 2011 Crocs, in pursuit of growth, tried to go into more luxury items ultimately spreading themselves to thin. This resulted in changes in management a few times until 2014 when Andrew Rees was chosen as CEO and instigated a radical shift in the company by closed the broad wholesale relationships and staying with ones that were the most successful and supported the brand image. Along with the closing of many wholesale distribution channels, Crocs also closed many unprofitable brand-owned stores which only sold Crocs-branded products similar to Lego stores. They closed manufacturing centers in favor of third party manufacturing which was much better for the company’s health and strain on the cycle of production and freed up cash. Along with better marketing, a boost in sales was seen in 2012-2015, but unfortunately it then stagnated. 
	Some growth was seen in 2018 at 6% and in 2019 with 12.6%, an as COVID started, the company was able to grow digitally and create relationships with brands and celebrities allowing for large growth of 67% in 2021. 

Crocs Product Lineup: Clogs, Sandals, Flip-Flops, Slides, Flats, Sneaker, Boots, Loafers, Socks, and Jibbitz

	The largest revenue contributors are the Clogs, Sandals. Slides, then Jibbitz with the other types of casual footwear being much smaller contributors.





	The product price ranges from $15 - $95 with the low end of the range being mostly slides or sandals along with jibitz and socks. At the higher end at $60 are high end clogs with cool designs and more ankle support or better traction bottoms. Even higher than that in the $80 - $95 are bundles of flats, sandals, clogs, sock, with designs and custom Jibbitz such as American flag clogs with patriotic Jibbitz and socks. 
	However, these aren’t single products so single product prices range from $15 - $65 which is at the lower range of footwear apparel, even in the casual footwear space giving Crocs (including HEYDUDE) a very large TAM of $160Bn with it being only $40Bn without HEYDUDE due to the fact that HEYDUDE loafers open up a larger part of the footwear market.

Most of their footwear, as a main staple of their brand and business model, have holes in which Jibbitz can be put in.

	Jibbitz are pretty much charms that can be attached to Crocs’ clogs and sandals which have 26 holes on a pair and are very popular among people who have brand awareness and along with their clog shoes. It is one of their most well known products. 

 - Crocs averages 5 - 6% of revenue through Jibbitz which in 2021 ended up at around $112 million.

	Their pricing is amazing with black and white letters going for $5 each and gold letters going for $6 each making it so that using modeling for certain phrases or names popular among their mostly young customers. Along with letters, customers can buy ‘special charms’ that have iconic characters like Patrick from SpongeBob SquarePants a popular television show from the childhood of many of their customers, or Yoda from Star wars. This allows for people to express themselves in more than just their style. Besides this, many people customize the (excuse my language) heck out of their clogs and fill all 26 holes of their pair of footwear which itself costs at least $100 or often more than the actual shoe.
	Besides the customer appeal of the customization and expression of interests, it provides a lot of value because it is simply one piece of plastic that can be stuck in the hole and does not fall out making an easy manufacturing process using plastic molds along with a design on the top. 

	Crocs produces all of its products with third-part manufacturing mostly in SEA and HEYDUDE does the same with the majority of manufacturing in China and Indonesia.

	They sell their products through a combination of wholesale brick and mortar relationships which make up around 50% of sales along with 375 of their own Crocs-branded stores. Another 50% of sales are through digital/e-commerce e-retailers, third-party marketplaces, and their own websites which are well-developed and are similar in style to websites like Nike and is the only place where every Jibbitz charm can be purchased acting as a large pull factor

Crocs Marketing

Introduction:
	Crocs is an international brand and cater to clients in at least ninety countries of the world. Its distribution channel includes international and domestic distributors and retailers along with direct-dealing consumers. 
	As said before, it is pretty evenly split between wholesale and direct-to-consumer along with manufacturing being mostly in Asia, more specifically SEA.



Customer Perception:
	Crocs is an American footwear company based in Colorado, USA, responsible for creating one of the most unique (and one of the most hated) shoes of all time: the foam clogs. You’ll feel that you’re not only wearing a unique design, but Crocs’ signature product also provides you unparalleled comfort and long-lasting durability.

Overcoming Appearance:

	Though crocs are now known for their functionality, comfort, durability, and as some would describe “funky look,” this look used to be the main threat to the business. A decade ago, people cared less about a product’s uses, and more about how it is aesthetically pleasing which crocs definitely weren’t. 

	In the last decade, a shift in consumer buying process occurred. Consumers now care much more about the utility and health benefits of products they use and are much more eco-conscious. This is more or less due to the expansion of information accessibility and especially social media. This is similar to the reason why diets/lifestyles such as veganism, vegetarianism, keto, and IF (intermittent fasting) have become popular recently.

	This has created the perfect setup for Crocs as their main downside has turned into a strength making their brand iconic and unique since people care less about aesthetic. It has allowed for a strong brand identity to be developed that is known for selling very durable, eco-friendly, and fun products.

Pandemic POWER:
	Another important business strategy Crocs adopted was to market itself as the ideal shoes for frontline healthcare workers because they are easy to clean and inexpensive to replace.
	Reportedly, it has given away some 860,000 pairs of shoes to healthcare workers in the U.S. worth $40 million in retail value and $10 million in cost to the company. And footwear analysts say: “People who weren’t considering the brand a year and a half ago are now considering Crocs.”

	Their major strength of durability has slowly become a large risk in that one pair of crocs can be worn for years. Management has clearly realized and attacked this business risk by increasing prices off what once was a $30 shoe to $45 - $60. This is a smart move because not only is it largely mitigating the risk of non-recurring customers, it is also capitalizing on their increased brand awareness making this price increase more reasonable in the consumer’s mind because of Crocs being known for its durability.

Pricing Power &amp; Possible Problems:
	Crocs’ Product Portfolio of footwear (excluding Jibbitz) is priced based off of the customer’s time of use. Because of the whole’s for ventilation in Clogs and the open nature of sandals are ideal in warm weather when this ventilation is needed not only for comfortability, but also health wise for outdoor activities such as nature walking. This ventilation greatly lowers the chance of fungus/bacteria growth because they thrive in warm&amp;damp&amp;dark conditions and the holes and proprietary hydrophobic crocslite material prevents this growth.
	These are all reasons why Crocs’ products are priced significantly higher during the spring, summer, and early winter leading to a much worse operating margin during Q1 which expands by usually 600-800 BP in the peak summer months. This creates a possible business impact of people taking notice and buying their footwear in the winter months though this wouldn’t be large enough to greatly affect future performance, but on many blogs that parents view, the seasonal pricing is one of the more highlighted details.

Power of Digital Marketing:
	One of the many reasons for Crocs’ success over the last 3 years is their marketing, more specifically their digital marketing. What is so great about Crocs is their customer engagement which is creating loyalty and repeat purchasing which are major tenants of the digital marketing funnel. One example of their success in digital marketing is their visible engagement is their Instagram account. They have 1.4M followers and they average almost 30k likes per post. This is a crazy high like-to-follower ratio that many consumer brands can only dream of. 
	Along with this, they have great reach outside to other audiences through a flurry of content such as memes and reels which the algorithm favors greatly. The great thing is that most of their content is customer produced and also comes from platforms like TikTok and YouTube allowing them to captivate on a much younger audience which will surely propel future growthl
	By using their brand identity so correctly on their IG, they are improving their brand image so much and are definitely one of the most successful consumer brands in digital marketing.

Celebrity &amp; Brand Partnerships:
	Their Celebrity Partnerships aren’t usually very large but are extremely targeted at the influencer’s fan base
• The official ambassadors of the brand are Drew Barrymore and Natalie Dormer that ""sold"" their products to young women, trying to convince them that Crocs are fashionable.
• Popular rap singer Post Malone released his own version of Crocs that sold out in just 10 minutes.
• In 2015, little Prince George appeared in Crocs and increased the sales of kids' slippers by 1,500%.
• Also, Crocs have been worn by George W. Bush, actress Helen Mirren, singer Ariana Grande, and many other famous people.

	Recently in July of 2020, a collaboration between KFC and Crocs was done making Fried Chicken Shoes which sold out in less than 30 minutes.






In Balenciaga’s 2022 Summer collection, there was announced to be a crocs partnership in which both brands created a crocs style shoe with a large Balenciaga’s platform style.



	Along with the Jibbitz charms allowing customers to express their support for movements, phrases, and characters, Jibbitz also allow customers to express their personality and emotions and greatly increase second hand marketing not only through posting on social media, but also through simply seeing a friend with cool charms on their pair of crocs. This is basically word-of-mouth marketing at its purest form based not at actual word, but on the trust one has with the person wearing the Crocs transferring to trust in the brand. It also creates FOMO (fear-of-missing-out) similarly to a kid seeing their friends with a new toy and wanting the toy also. 
	Clearly, these brand partnerships allow customers to express themselves and create loyal and ecstatic customers that are willing to pay top dollar and premium on the secondary markets increasing popularity.

ESG Analysis

	Though it isn’t the best ESG ranking, this is mainly due to the fact that the textile industry often employs overseas labor.
	Though there surely won’t be any ESG mania over Crocs, the business itself is sustainable in its nature.

	Crocs has given away some 860,000 pairs of shoes to healthcare workers in the U.S. worth $40 million in retail value and $10 million in cost to the company.
	Crocs shoes are made from croslite, a closed-cell resin made from polymer. This soft material is scratch-resistant along with being slip-resistant. This makes it so that Crocs shoes are very durable and last much longer than normal shoes making the product a very eco-conscious choice.
	Crocs has set a goal of going net zero emissions by 2030 and just recently they announced the appointment of a VP focused on this goal.

Market Analysis:
	The Casual Footwear market is set to grow At 2-3% CAGR over the next several years though the growth does not matter as much since it is very large and there is clear opportunity for growth through Crocs marketing expertise which is very good along with a diversified product portfolio with the growth of non-clog footwear and the HEYDUDE loafers
	Crocs has expanded its demographic massively to not just older people, but to a lot of teenagers and currently, according to a Piper Sandler survey, they are the 8th most popular brand among teenagers which will currently help the long term future of the company.
	Along with demographics, they have expanded their geography a lot with many sales in EMEA and especially in Asia

Market Share
	Crocs’ main product is Clogs which essentially, as seen in this BAM model, they have competitors for and this market is worth $4 billion and is its own sub market of the casual footwear market.

MarcoEconomic Headwinds:
	Inflation is forcing price increases with Crocs and most brands. Because casual footwear’s less necesssary nature, there is the chance of consumers not wanting to bite the cost. Though Crocs’ uniqueness helps mitigate this and its $40-$60 price gives it an above average income customer who can stomach some price raising especially with the durability of the product.

MacroEconomic Tailwinds
	The Continued growth in digital or e-commerce spending allowing for Crocs and the industry to grow well online. Though a partial problem of lowered margins on Amazon and other platforms, but luckily Crocs has a solid site which attracts a lot of people, mitigating this problem.

Enterprise Value post-HEYDUDE acquisition 
	My calculations for Estimated Enterprise Value after Q1 Report on May 5, 2022 are in the appendix. I did this because using the 2021 FY EV is significantly skewed to the upside because it does not include the debt from the HEYDUDE acquisition which asses $2.05Bn in Debt. I then averaged the three cases from my DCF below this section.


	Here is the comparison of CROX NTM EV/EBIT to its industry which, excluding GEO, was 13.18x significantly higher than CROX - this included specialty retail, large premium apparel brands, and wholesale competitors.

	A more likely accurate comparison is on the right with all of CROX’s competition in the branded casual footwear. Unfortunately, two of them had negative/Not available data. This also gave an average of 10.44x, which is pretty high in comparison to CROX’s 8.71x ratio


	The fact is that CROX has the highest margin and fastest revenue growth on this list with higher margins than LULU, NIKE, and TOD'S which are all large premium bands with decent low teens revenue growth and mid to high teen operating margins
	These companies are trading at 3-4x higher due to the facts of size, better financial position, predictability, balance sheet, or brand value. Enterprise Value includes a large part of financial health so the financial position/balance sheet is not really the reason. I think that in the next few years, CROX will have closed some of the gap between these giants.
	SKX - One of CROX's competitors along with Doc Martens both trade in the range i believe CROX should be trading in. If Crocs were to trade at a NTM EV/EBIT of 10.5 which is in this range, this would result in a 31.5% upside in price or over $95 per share. 
	Doc Martens is forecasted to have similar growth rates in the high to mid teens and similar margins at 23% though they trade at 11.7 NTM EV/EBIT and are definitely a smaller brand and should trade at a discount meaning that logically CROX could trade even higher.
	For instance, SKX has lower margins and lower growth rates more in the high singles and low teens long term though they trade higher because of their balance sheet which is valued highly in these time of interest rates and CSP &amp; GDP growth being questioned along with inflation. 
	Though this is partially the reason, more with the acquisition and bear market, it should not be a problem because the debt CROX just took out should be paid out fairly quickly with FCF.

	This clearly shows that the recent drop in CROX’s price was most likely an overreaction and that CROX, in a peer comparison, has a large MOAT adding to its margin of safety and that it is trading significantly under its intrinsic value.

	Along with this through reading through the 130 page loan term agreement for the Loan taken out for the HEYDUDE acquisition and 8-k:
• Interest rate = 3.50% + {Term SOFR + Term SOFR adjustment}(0.5% SOFR floor)
• If they decide to pay in 1 month intervals: 4% interest rate
• 3 month intervals: 4.32% interest rate
• 6 month intervals: 4.82% interest rate
	These numbers are all as of April 1st and the agreement was on Feb. 17. If they were smart, they would have locked in a low 4.52% interest rate for 6 months knowing the Fed’s rate hikes were coming. The long term interest rates after some 

Investment Thesis:
	In my appendix, you can see a DCF analysis of 3 cases based off of guidance for CROX and along with this, I made a worse-case scenario with pre-COVID growth rates and margins. I think it is so unlikely for crocs to return to as it was before COVID because it has gone through such a transformation. This can be seen in its brand image and marketing which is now known by a younger audience, its excellent reforming of distribution channels, its growth of digital distribution channels, and its growth of DTC by 45% to 54% of revenues Yoy making the business health much stronger than 2-3 years ago.
	The DCF discount rate here is 10% though I am basing my thesis more on a visibly undervalued stock based on future cash flow alone outpacing 10% along with visible growth shows a strong business plan and really strong management. I also think the peer comparison is a better judgement than the discounting part of the cash flow and that the growth of the company in the future will show that they deserve a higher multiple even in this bear market.
	 I think they will get below 2.0x Net Debt-to-EBITDA by 2023 YE which is seen in the appendix through long calculations involving cash flow analysis using capital expenditure, D&amp;A, taxation, valuation allowance, debt obligations, and interest expense.
	Management has promised that once they reach this leverage ratio, they will start committing free cash flow to share buybacks which have been their main way of returning value to shareholders over the past 3 years with CROX purchasing back over $1B in shares in 2021.
	Say by the end of 2024, if they adjust to 12.8x NTM EV/EBITDA, which is the 3-year ratio average pre-COVID from 2017 - 2019, with a conservative 2025E EBITDA of $1.35B (less than bear case), CROX should have an EV of 17.3 billion. Assuming net debt stays constant from 2023 YE to 2024 YE, we get a market cap of 15 billion with $800M of FCF in 2024 assuming $600M is put towards buybacks.  This gives a 3-year target price of $245 or a 240% upsidew/out share buybacks and if share buybacks are done in the most conservative way at the target price, we get an adjusted 3-year target price of $255 of a 250% upside. 
	For the sake of showing I am not bias, I am going to use the Worst case scenario which has pre-COVID financials with decreasing margins, decreasing growth, HEYDUDE dying, and it instead takes 3 years to reach the leverage ratio instead of two. If this happened, this means that the management that has transformed the company over the last 4 years and brought it to its greatness today will be kicked out, that is how bad this case is. Say by the end of 2024, if they adjust to a 10x NTM EV/EBITDA which is below its peers current average and below historical, they will achieve an enterprise value of $7 billion with $2.3 billion in net debt giving a market cap of $4.7 billion and in the years afterward, they would likely be buying back $400M in stock which is an over 8% return which would likely also be priced in and give a good return. 
	This just shows that even in the worst of the worst situation, a small opportunity cost may be the only cost of this investment.

Manufacturing and Capital Expenditure:
	As stated in the 2021 10-K, “Despite these actions, we expect to still be impacted by global logistics challenges in 2022. Specifically we plan to invest approximately $75MM in air freight in 2022 to bolster out inventory positions for the first half of the year in all regions. Supported by the health of our brand, wholesale orders for the first half of 2022 have been strong. However, we expect to have limitations around demand fulfillment in the first half of the year.”
	There are Supply chain issues with Crocs itself. Also, China’s recent lockdowns have a chance of afffecting HEYDUDE demand fulfillment and their manufacturing  being largely in China and Indonesia.
	Around half of current cash, which is 200MM is held up in manufacturing centers so though there is technically less cash on hands. The company has ready cash to increase inventory and a line of credit of $600MM if needed with a cash conversion cycle of around 83 days which is average to long for the industry, there is definitely apt liquidity for growth.
	The Guidance 2022 CAPEX of $170-200MM is enough to support future growth along with the 3% of revenue long term. This isn’t horrible considering a 26+% operating margin along with a considerable tax write off along with intra-IP transfer making effective tax rate on on EBT being more like 10-15%.
	Post 2023 with long term guidance, these are the rough number using 26% operating margin, interest of $85M, and CAPEX of 3%.
	This leads to over a billion in FCF by 2026 with probably only the mandatory 1% or $20MM in principal which is incredible and will be used for share buybacks and possibly a dividend once growth slows down.

Four Tenants behind long term growth:
Digital Sales:
• The company’s goal is to maintain a 40% of total revenue being through digital and thus by 2026E, reach $2.5Bn in digital sales.
• One of the main ways is through their website, Crocs.com, the place with the largest selection of Jibbitz charms being a mature gateway product to the website. This is especially important because selling direct through their website is much easier and increases their margin. I would say Crocs has a very robust and well designed website that is sure to be increasing along with their cumulative digital penetration.
• Along with their website, they sell through many e-commerce sites such as Amazon, Zappos, Zalando, and Tmall
• Along with digital being an important distribution/sales method in most B2C businesses, digital selling has allowed Crocs to grow faster in EMEA and Asia especially where e-commerce adoption is strong with e-retailers like Alibaba.com, Pinduoduo.com, JD.com, and third-party markets like Tmall.

Sandals Market Opportunity:
• Their casual market which is practically the market for sandals is worth $30B and is very fragmented with no clear leader.
• Though it is fragmented, they key manufacturers of the casual sandal market are Cbanner, Crocs, Aokang, Adidas, Clark, STand SAT, Belle, Kenneth Cole, Daphne, Skechers, GEOX, Rieker, Aldo, topscore, Steven Madden, ECCO, Decker, Caleres, Apargatas, Birkenstock, and RedDragonfly.
• Sandals provide an additional gateway product along with product sales have little seasonality along like Clogs.
• The main consideration of consumers when looking for sandals is icon, style, comfort, adventure. Crocs does have icon considering they have large brand awareness in the casual footwear market, their style is very good along with the ability for jibitz charms attachments, they definitely have comfortability because of the material, and their material is durable and adventurous.
• The Sandals brand consideration or awareness is shares with Clogs allowing for easier customer acquisition and no need to build brand identity in a new market.
• The Downfall of Croc before 2014 had been the the spreading thin of the brand into unfamiliar yet appealingly high growth markets. This is the downfall of many apparel branding who are both blessed and then cursed by the need for growth.

	Luckily, this expansion into a familiar and similar casual market shows that the company is correctly using their knowledge and expanding into the correct markets and not just the most attractive ones. 
	The company has a target of 4x Sandals Revenue Growth by 2026E.

Asian Market Opportunity for Long-Term growth:
• Asia, more importantly China, provides the greatest opportunity to support long-term growth with China being the largest footwear market.
• Digital adoption had been very strong in China with their being large participation on key platforms like Tmall, Alibaba.com, or Pinduoduo.com
• The strategies being used are developing local-for-local production, marketing, and collaborations with already most of Crocs third-party manufacturing being done in Southeast Asia and much of HEYDUDE manufacturing in China. Along with this, almost all HEYDUDE sales are in North America while Crocs already has a pretty large Asian presence which means this is also a great opportunity for the casual loafers of HEYDUDE.

Details of HEYDUDE acquisition and Great Management:
• The acquisition was closed on February 17, 2022 and was financed by $2B in a Term Loan, $450 million in shares at a price double the current, and $50MM from a line of Credit.
• The shares went to the founder who has a two-year half and half lockup period for the shares and he will continue to be on the HEYDUDE team.
• Along with founder, Rick Blackshaw will be the EVP and Brand President. He has 25 years of experience in footwear and consumer products with being a president of Sperry,  President of Keds, VP of the Chuck Taylor division of Converse, and other roles in Timberland and Reebok. He is an industry veteran with decades of experience who will be a great leader for the brand.

Strategic Rationale: A high Growth, highly profitable, strong cash flow
• This acquisition creates a leader in branded casual footwear being only second to Skechers and expands the company to multi-product/multi-brand
• Aids in Digital Growth Framework with HEYDUDE having almost 50% of sales digital in 2021 
• Ability to build and leverage Crocs playbook of marketing expertise and wholesale relationships

HEYDUDE wholesale and Specialty opportunity &amp; Marketing:
• Crocs has a total of 375 company owned stores that sell only Crocs products opening up another distribution play for HEYDUDE, though 20-30 stores were closed in lieu of Ukraine-Russia Conflict.
• Along with their stores, of the top 20 B&amp;M wholesale relationships for both companies, only 6 of them overlap meaning their is a large possibility for B&amp;M expansion.
• The other additive to growth is the marketing opportunity with Crocs brand awareness at 92% of market while HEYDUDE is only at 20%.

	All of this is reason why I think it will be possible for HEYDUDE to be worth it long term even though the expensive cost with 2022E revenue being $700-750MM with a 25%+ operating margin and that they will be able to get to $1Bn+ by 2024.

Management:

	In the last 8 years, the company has bought back shares. These buybacks, at the time, constituted at least 5% (excluding 2016) of the outstanding and in some of these years, the buyback amount constituted up to 15% of outstanding. Along with this, the company had a dividend of 12 million from 2014-2018 meaning that the management has consistently returned value to shareholders through buybacks, dividends, or a combination of the two. 

	During 2021, the company in a very smart decision sold $700MM in junk bonds in two seperate borrowings in order to pay back debt and allow for buyback of shares buy capitalizing on historically low interest rates.

	This clearly shows management’s commitment to returning value to shareholders and they still have a remaining authorization for over a billion in shares to buyback and promise to do so once their Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 2.0x.

	Along with buying back shares and dividends showing management’s commitment to returning value to shareholders, there is also a quite significant amount of insider ownership with around 100-200MM by current governance. There is also significant ownership by the founders who own near 10% of the float.

	Besides the insider ownership being a good amount, what is most important is the recent insider trading and in the last 3 months, insiders have bought 255k shares and sold 80k which is almost all of the insider shares bought in the last 12 months according to NASDAQ.
This is a pretty clear indication governance views shares as too cheap at this point.

	Along with this, management seems pretty transparent in the view on this business especially when considering the impact of supply chain issues in the first half of this year along with expenses related to the HEYDUDE acquisitions
	Along with business risks in 2022E, the company has also set quite detailed guidance for 2022 of Revenue of $3.4Bn, at least an adjusted operating margin of 26%, Capital expenditure of $170 - 200MM.
	Along with clear and detailed estimates for 2022, they have made long term goals of $6Bn+ in revenue by 2026E, $1Bn+ in revenue for HEYDUDE by 2024E, 26%+ adjusted operating margin, and capital expenditure should average at around 3% of revenue with the exception of 2022E.
	Along with all of this, the number of shares short has dropped significantly in the last few months going from 4.9 million in October to currently 2.6 million. This means that many shorts believe there is little downside left and thus a clear margin of safety at the current price below intrinsic value
	Along with all of these things backing up management’s competence, most to all of them have extensive experience at Crocs or are veterans of the footwear industry including the EVP/Brand President of HEYDUDE, Rick Blackshaw, and so does Andrew Rees, CEO and director for CROX.

Competitive Positioning:
	Besides being priced significantly beneath its competitors giving CROX a MOAT in terms of valuation due to its lower multiple, it’s market position among casual footwear is very strong and unique. It’s clogs, what Crocs is known for, is a very durable and long-lasting shoe that is still casual in use and appearance. Along with its initially ugly appearance makes it unique, clogs themselves are there own small part of the footwear market like slides or sandals just smaller. The unique factors of its shoes are covered more in detail in the product line up and marketing section.
	The usefulness of this uniqueness is that it drives large brand awareness since Crocs is a household name now, especially with the recent rise. The clog, its star product, has also driven traffic to its other product lines such as its slides and sandals which also have JIbbitiz which provide a large competitive edge because they allow for personal customization and expression. 

Margin of Safety:
• Unreasonable 60% drop over the last 6 months
• At a discount to smaller peers on a EV/EBITDA basis and FCF basis
• One of the largest and most-well known casual footwear brands
• Insider Buying of Shares showing Management backing
• Short-Interest Coverage helping out short-term visibility on a technical perspective
• Shares were repurchased at higher than current price

Summary of Investment Idea and Summary:
	A simplification of my idea/thesis is that CROX has recently seen an overreaction to the news of the HEYDUDE acquisition which causes the stop in share buybacks because cash flow over the next 2 years is being used to pay back debt and rising CAPeX and along with Fed’s rate rising, inflation, Russia-Ukraine Conflict causing the market to shift to bearish at least in the short term. The price of CROX has thus fallen from a high of $180 to the current price of $75 which I view as significantly undervalued.
	CROX is trading at 7.98x NTM EV/EBITDA which is a significant discount to its peers in the branded casual footwear space along with peers in the Textiles, Apparel, and Luxury Goods industry. Along with this margin of safety, it has large brand awareness and after this acquisition, has a diversified product line with a long term revenue growth around 20%+ and an operating margin 26%+ allowing for strong cash flow generation.
	What can already be seen from my calculations in my report is that CROX will be deleveraged enough by 2023E year end to start buying back a large amount of shares and possibly in the long term future reinstating its dividend. 
	I feel that my report clearly shows that CROX is significantly undervalued and over the next year my target price is $110 from a current price of $75 and over the next three years, my target price is $245.

Risks: 
• Inflation - Crocs has already, in their own words, been “early” to their competitors in raising prices since management expected inflation to be more severe than others which played out really well and makes the margins sustainable.
• The causal footwear brand has a relatively low barrier to entry creating significant competition along with brand counterfeiting or fake clogs which though used to be a bigger problem, still hurt sales.
• Supply-chain disruptions though margins are still high and are mostly factored into guidance though in the future, if recovery is slower than expected, CAPEX may be higher thus lower FCF.
• HEYDUDE not growing as much as intended though to reach the ambitions, it only requires continuing the same growth rate as Crocs, though synergy with Crocs is likely considering the strong management.
• Possible Overdependence on brand value leading to brand stagnation and failure to strengthen and preserve value though success in marketing is clear with Marketing and advertising becoming a smaller % of revenue over the past 5 years, Pre-COVID.


Catalysts:
• Meeting or Exceeding of Mangement’s Guidance or Exceeding of Analyst’s Expectations
• HEYDUDE outperforming expectations and strategic rationale playing out better than expected.
• Economy performing better with inflation being more on the mild/medium level and Consumer Spending being much higher.
• Meeting the leverage ratio to buyback shares earlier than expected due to non-cash recoveries or use of current cash&amp;cash equivalents.


Appendix:

Enterprise Value Calculation














Discounted Cash Flow with 3 cases





The only difference (at least for 2022) between GAAP and Non-GAAP operating margin is the HEYDUDE acquisition costs which make GAAP 22%. Much of that is non-cash costs, but besides this, there will be little difference in adjusted operating and GAAP operating.

personalfinance,Paying off personal loan vs credit card?,"I received a modest lump sum recently. Since I have a job/consistent paychecks, I’d like to put most of that money towards debt.

I have:
- a personal loan that’s 4/5ths paid off
- a credit card that’s stressfully close to its limit (yeah I know that’s bad, it was a rough couple years tho)

They’re both with the same bank, and also, the credit card definitely has a significantly higher interest rate, of course. I don’t have enough to pay off both in their entirety.


I was considering:
1. Paying off the personal loan early, paying down a large chunk of the CC, and then approaching my bank about a new loan specifically for the remaining CC balance, so I’d end with a paid off personal loan + paid off CC + much lower interest rate on that balance than I currently have.

2. Putting everything I can contribute solely to the CC and not paying anything early on the personal loan. Then, approaching my bank about consolidating the rest of the CC debt (I’d have about 30% of my limit left to pay down) with the rest of the personal loan into a new loan.

3. Paying off the personal loan entirely, paying down my CC per option 2., and then leaving the remaining CC balance on the CC (instead of getting a new loan) and just paying it off aggressively?


I’m trying to weigh things like:
- this is kinda the beginning of me getting my financial self together, so I don’t really have any savings to speak of. Having a cleared off CC appeals to me because I know I have a back-pocket safety net if, like, my dog needs emergency surgery or whatever.

- However, the personal loan definitely has a substantially higher monthly payment, which won’t change until it’s paid off in full. Removing that payment from my monthly bills would allow me to more quickly continue to get on my feet. 

- The CC has a much lower monthly payment, but obviously, I’ll pay a lot more over time just in interest.


What are some considerations I should think about when deciding? 

Current questions include:

~ Would paying the personal loan off early negatively or positively affect my credit?
~ Would paying the loan off early make it easier or *harder* to get a good, second loan from the same bank? (Worth noting that, now I’m approaching the last months of the loan, and now that my CC debt crept up a bit, my bank has been sending me debt consolidation offers/letters)
~ Would paying down some of my CC help me get a better interest rate on a new loan? 
~ If so, would there be a huge difference in that benefit between: paying down only a small amount of my CC (number 1: if I’m prioritizing early loan payoff), vs paying off a larger chunk (number 2: if I don’t pay off any of the loan and instead pay off more of the CC)?
~ Would the benefits (if any) be worth it if I put a remaining CC balance into a new personal loan? Or, should I leave whatever CC balance as-is and just aggressively pay more than the minimum?


Thank you in advance!! Can clarify anything if needed. And yes, I did Google all of this, it’s still all a bit over my head so I thought I’d ask some actual people. Currently carless, so getting to the bank to meet with a banker physically is a bit tough right now.",finance,1652046950

economy,American Needs more Tax Brackets to Adjust the Wealth Gap,"I was given an assignment, and I went a little too far. I basically prepared a huge thesis about how America's past has affected the racial wealth gap. What I discovered is that the tax system is dysfunctional and contributes to a larger process than systemic racism. Because politics are perplexing, I attempted to make this paper as comprehensive and straightforward as possible so that I could comprehend them myself. I also liked learning and would appreciate criticism on any flaws in my reasoning. This portion of my thesis describes tax laws as a game of life in which the aim is to accumulate money.

Read the Full Paper Here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZrcZqjEDZvoIAAnBW2X98QfnG8Qa\_TtjQHTROspJaGY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZrcZqjEDZvoIAAnBW2X98QfnG8Qa_TtjQHTROspJaGY/edit?usp=sharing)

***The Game of Tax Codes***. Consider American tax regulations and the structure of the system as rules in a life-like video game. How do you address wealth inequality? Ideally, you want everyone to be similar in status for fairness, but provide incentives for people to be productive or play the game. Class hierarchies and their associated tax brackets are examples of this. As your income rises, so does the amount of tax divided into income brackets. Once your income reaches a threshold your income tax on extra money is transferred into a new bracket. Money is based on the citizen's trust and belief in the system, which ensures that the game is secure and fair. In this game, you'd want consumers to spend money on goods. With a specific emphasis on life's needs, to be available to everyone at a reasonable price; Therefore encouraging money to flow via consumer spending. You also want businesses to compete and stimulate the economy while simultaneously employing citizens. With money flowing from consumers to businesses and then back to workers, the federal government would collect money on income taxes. This encourages customers to spend and businesses to maintain production levels, all while the economy grows. The only disadvantage would be if the government's deficit or inflation increased. When it comes to expenditure, the greatest strategy to avoid a deficit is to utilize the government's ability to invest rather than consumption (“Investment vs. Consumption: How Well Are We Preparing for Our Future?”). Through FDR's administration's social security initiatives, this form of government investment has boosted the nation's economy. Government expenditure on goods related to consumption surged under Reagan's administration, which is typically bad. Government spending on investment for the benefit of people decreased during that period due to Reagan's budget cuts.  The government should be seen as a benevolent overseer who makes investments in the public benefit that society will pay back equitably, not the other way around.

***Tax Brackets Explicit Purpose.*** To Understand America’s fatal mistake of becoming corporate sellouts you need to understand one important concept: Marginal utility. The idea of marginal utility highlights the relevance of money in relation to one's income. When you have less money, every dollar you have becomes more valuable and useful for your needs. As a result, the government will reward you for playing the game by lowering your income tax. This is your incentive to play. When you have a lot of money, each dollar becomes less important to you and your needs. As a result, the federal government will raise taxes on additional  ""excessive"" income. This breaks down our progressive tax brackets. But here’s the thing: we only have 7 brackets as of 2022; So What does this mean for the top bracket?

***There are two sets of Rules***. During the Regan-Era the tax code was completely reformed. The goal was to supposedly “simplify” the tax system. This caused the removal of the high-income brackets tax rates; brackets that would heavily incentivize extreme levels of wealth accumulation in individuals. Take Roosevelt's 1932’s tax reform which pulled the United States through the great depression. Data from the IRS shows there are 55 tax brackets for single filing with the top income bracket being 1 million ($20.1m in 2022 USD) taxed at 63%. In the 1960s, the tax brackets for higher incomes began to dwindle. The highest income bracket in 1965 was $108,300 ($377,872 in 2022 USD);.  Reagan’s 1987 tax reform exacerbated the issue, dropping it to a staggering low of two with the top bracket being less than 18,000 (56,931.49 in 2022) being taxed at 28%. According to the census, the median household income in 1987 was $25,990 ($65,575.24 in 2022), and the poverty line was set at $11.600 ($29,267.90 in 2022). “Back in 1980, there were about 500,000 U.S millionaires' (“In the ’80s, the Rich Got a Lot Richer...”); America’s wealthiest and those somewhat nearing poverty were paying the same in taxes as the middle class.

***Where is the Middle Class?*** A trend of dramatically reducing the number of tax brackets coupled with drastically lower tax rates than inside those brackets is effectively allowing the ultra-wealthy to play by different rules by placing a cap on the progressive tax brackets' ability to regulate wealth. America is incentivizing heavy tax burdens on those who fall within the lower brackets; While those who excessively exceed the highest bracket amount are paying extremely less than a supposed progressive tax would allow. In comparison to those who pay a progressive tax, the wealthiest people's tax burden is significantly less.  This allows the wealthiest to keep wealth while limiting the poor's ability to advance socially over time. This disruption in the flow of wealth allows revenue to flow to the wealthiest of the population, eventually separating the general public into distinct classes. Granting the wealthiest more purchasing power than their peers. This is due to the tax bracket's ability to distribute wealth but the inability to apply the same effects to the wealthiest; perpetuating the phasing out cycle.",finance,1652059460

investing,The Case for Optimism: Time to be greedy when others are fearful,"As of May 6th, the S&amp;P 500 is down \~14% while the Nasdaq is down \~25%. Americans are extremely pessimistic about the economy, with \~75% expecting the economy to worsen. Inflation concerns dominate the list of worries, with CPI in March 2022 coming in at a blistering 8.5%, the highest in 4 decades. The Fed has embarked on what appears to be the first of several 50 bps rate increases to cool inflation, in the hopes of engineering a ""soft landing"". On the geopolitical front, the tragic war in Ukraine rages on while China continues a ""zero covid"" policy with draconian lockdowns in Shanghai. 

However, my personal belief is that investors are missing the forest for the trees. While the stock market will likely remain volatile in 2022, I believe we can expect a return to a bull market driven by a healthy and sustainable US expansion. I personally will be investing an unexpected windfall into the market over the next month. Below is a short list of my reasons, but I'd love to spark a discussion!

Note: all of these statistics, unless otherwise noted, apply to the US stock market / economy. However I am similarly bullish on other developed market economies (Japan, EU, etc.) given their attractive valuations. 

**Rationale:**

1. Strength of the underlying US economy
   1. The US added \~428,000 jobs in April across a broad array of industries led by, importantly, leisure &amp; hospitality + manufacturing, with a \~5.5% year over year increase in wages
   2. Consumers are estimated to have accumulated \~$2.7 trillion in excess savings over the pandemic
   3. A key point often overlooked is that Americans have gained at least $6 trillion (!) in real estate equity, and that figure excludes rental properties. More importantly, while stock ownership is heavily concentrated (the top \~10% richest US households own 90% of stocks) real estate holdings are distributed **relatively** more equally 
   4. The bottom line is that while inflation and the recent market correction is painful, American households (notably wealthier households) have ample resources to drive consumption
2. Corporate refinancings / corporate profits
   1. Corporations took advantage of the 2020 / 2021 drop in interest rates to issue record setting levels of cheap debt, \~$2.28 Trillion in 2020 and \~$3 trillion in 2021. The average corporate interest rate stands at 3.6%, which means corporations have both extended their debt maturities and reduced their interest expenses 
   2. Corporate profits are at record levels, in 2021, at \~$2.8 trillion
   3. Corporates are also sitting on mountains of cash, with \~$2.7 Trillion in cash or short term maturities
   4. Goldman Sachs estimates a record $1 trillion in share buybacks in 2022, a 12% increase over 2021. In the first 2 months of 2022 corporates have already authorized $238 billion in buybacks
   5. In some ways, the economic uncertainty may actually benefit investors. Companies may turn towards buybacks in lieu of investing in riskier projects (as seen in 2012 - 2015) 
3. Key Inflation drivers moderating 
   1. While the headline inflation is unarguably worrying, it's important to focus on what is driving inflation
   2. Much of the most recent increase in March headline inflation was driven by the spike in energy prices: gas, fuel oil, airline fares, electricity, etc. Another substantial portion was driven by the ongoing shortage of used / new cars due to the semiconductor shortage
   3. Perhaps more importantly, the ""comps"" used to calculate year over year inflation provide a natural tailwind as inflation began to accelerate in Q2 2021 
   4. One area of concern going forward is how much inflation we see due to shelter increases, which is just now starting to show up in the data (\~4.5% in March 2022). It's worth keeping in mind that rent is not directly measured by the CPI, only ""owners equivalent rent""
   5. The other wildcard is wage inflation leading to a ""wage price spiral"". I certainly acknowledge it's a risk, but it's worth keeping in mind that the US labor force is still down 1.2 million pre-pandemic levels (and that excludes the natural growth of the labor force for \~2 years). Another note is that the share of the economy going to labor has, surprisingly, declined. 
   6. I suspect we will continue to draw more workers into the economy as pandemic fears continue to recede, child care becomes more stable, and higher wages lure back ""retired"" workers. I also think much of the recent wage inflation is a one-off step-up to a de facto ""minimum wage"" increase to $15 driven by social pressure and a recalculation of the benefits of retention by large corporate employers. 
4. Medium term resolution of key global issues 
   1. I have no military background, so I'll avoid speculating on the tragic invasion of Ukraine by Russia. My only comment is that the consensus view, after wildly overestimating Russian's military prowess, seems to be that Russian military power is rapidly eroding. The pivot from Kyiv to the Donbas region seems to suggest more limited Russian objectives. From a strictly economic point of view, leaving aside the vast human cost and misery, my view is that the bad news is ""priced in"" and that further developments are likely to the upside (negotiations between Ukraine / Russia, more limited official objectives from Putin, etc.) 
   2. In a similar vein China's zero covid policy and draconian lockdown has both lowered Chinese GDP and snarled further supply chain issues. Again, my only opinion here is that the bad news is ""priced in"". If we look forward, it's likely that either China will successfully control the Covid outbreaks or, alternatively, will join the rest of the world in a mitigation strategy after the 20th Annual Party Congress when President Xi feels more secure. 
5. Extreme pessimism 
   1. 53% of investors in the AII survey indicate they are bearish, 20% higher than historical averages. Likewise consumer surveys also indicate significant pessimism 
   2. I personally think the recent sell-off is far too broad based, and has affected healthy, relatively inflation resistant equity sectors (e.g. financials, CPG, etc.) 
6. Painful, but healthy, tech stock reset 
   1. Somewhere around 25% of the market cap of the S&amp;P 500 is the ""FAANG"" stocks (although now Microsoft &amp; Tesla instead of Netflix). The US tech sector is suffering from 2 distinct, but intertwined phenomena. 
   2. The first is that ""trees don't grow to the sky"". Netflix &amp; Meta (Facebook), for example, are naturally reaching limits to their breakneck growth as they already dominate their respective, maturing industries. Likewise Amazon and other e-commerce / digitalization companies are showing sharply slower growth as demand was pulled forward and intensified by the pandemic. As their growth naturally slows, we can expect investors to start valuing them more as mature, profitable enterprises (e.g. Meta now trades at a PE of 16, not far off from JP Morgan at a PE of \~10) 
   3. The second is that investors have basically been pattern matching every ""tech"" company to Alphabet (Google), Meta, etc. True tech companies are defined by network effects, i.e. the marginal cost of serving the next customer trends towards zero. Now some companies only have partial network effects, e.g. Apple drives most of its revenue from hardware, but that hardware ecosystem drives massive network effects with its App store. But other companies are clearly not this pattern, e.g. Palantir relies heavily on professional services (often labeled as ""sales &amp; marketing expenses"") to secure its next customer. 
   4. Low interest rates also drove immense interest in Venture Capital, with new players like Tiger Global (who raised an additional $11B in Feb 2022) deploying billions into startups. Many of the ""mega fundraising rounds"" of late 2020 - early 2022 drove unrealistic valuations. E.g. Bolt, a fintech, raised $355M at an $11B valuation with revenues of \~$40M. Fast, another Fintech, raised a $102M series B round with revenues of low six figures. 
   5. The bottom line is we are seeing a healthy, if potentially overreactive, correction to growth stocks. The next year will likely be painful for late stage startups, particularly those who are not cash flow positive. I suspect we will start to hear layoff announcements at these startups and a slowdown in hiring at the large tech companies (e.g. Meta just repoted a hiring freeze)

**Conclusion**:

As an interesting historical parallel, inflation spiked heavily in the US in 1946-1948 after WW2. I suspect  that much of that inflation was driven by a large increase in consumer spending demand and constrained supply due to a lag in the economy returning to a normal, civilian oriented approach.  

I think the current US economy is also in a current state of transition. While the markets will likely remain volatile for some time, I personally believe inflation has already peaked. Over the next year companies will deploy this massive cash reserves in share buybacks. Consumers, particularly the affluent, will leverage both their accumulated savings and vast increase in real estate equity to drive consumption. Hopefully workers will continue to see pay raises, which with inflation moderating, will turn into **real** wage gains.

With the rising tide of interest rates I‘m looking into not just value companies, but some which might be considered „value trap“ companies.

My reasoning being that money during the currently ending (?) low-rates period went into high growth/potential/hype stocks. So I‘m looking at potentially overlooked stocks, ideally with good fundamentals. 

Companies in „decline“ would also be of interest. Not necessarily companies in systemic decline, but cyclical would be ok.

Can I ask you for your suggestions and a short comment on each stock? Obviously ETFs bundling said stocks would be a bonus, but little chance of that.

investing,"In case of recession, where should one put his money?","Deutsche Bank is the first major bank to forecast a US recession. ""We will get a major recession,"" Deutsche Bank economists wrote.

The problem, according to the bank, is that while inflation may be peaking, it will take a ""long time"" before it gets back down to the Fed's goal of 2%. That suggests the central bank will raise interest rates so aggressively that it hurts the economy.

Thirty-eight percent of small US business owners say inflation is their biggest concern, twice as many as the second place “supply chain disruptions” (19%) and well above Covid-19 (13%) and labor shortages (13%).

personalfinance,How to Re-balance a Disproportionate Amount of Equities to Fixed Income during a Correction?,"Assume for sake of argument that you are nearing retirement and have a portfolio entirely in a 401K which is currently 80% equities (e.g. SPY or VTI) and 20% bonds/cash. The goal is to have several years of living expenses in fixed income. You already made the mistake of not slowly re-balancing from stocks to bonds/cash over time, and wish to correct that mistake now. To make matters worse, assume we are in a correction (as we almost are now) and that interest rates are rising.

Is there any particular strategy one should follow when doing a very large re-balance (from 80% equities to 50% equities)?

---

Given the beating the market has taken this year, it would be a bummer to sell 30% of the portfolio's equities and convert that portion to bonds and cash, especially if the markets rebound after doing this re-balancing.

Would it be better to wait until the market has rebounded before re-balancing this large amount? On the other hand, if the market continued to slide into a multi-year recession, it might have been better to convert some large portion to bonds/cash now then wait multiple years.

Is it safer to do some kind of dollar cost averaging, where you re-balance say 10% each year for the next three years?

Another problem is that these rising interest rates are killing most of these bonds anyways. I suppose the solution is to re-balance into short term bond funds or even just cash.",finance,1652099496

****

# [Dow futures drop more than 500 points as market sell-off continues with yields on the rise](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/08/stock-futures-fall-as-wall-street-looks-to-stabilize-after-rollercoaster-week.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell sharply early Monday, as U.S. rates continued to rise and traders struggled to find their footing after big market swings last week.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 450 points, or 1.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 1.8%, while those for the Nasdaq 100 lost 2.3%.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield hit its highest level since late 2018 on Monday. It was last trading at 3.185%.
*****
&gt; That rate increase put pressure on Big Tech names such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet. Shares of Meta were down 2.5% in the premarket, and Alphabet lost 2.7%. Amazon, Apple and Netflix were all down more than 2% as well.
*****
&gt; Energy stocks fell broadly as U.S. oil futures slid more than 2% to $107.14 per barrel. Occidental Petroleum shares dipped 2.8% before the bell, and Schlumberger slipped 2.4%.
*****
&gt; “We expect markets to remain volatile, with risks skewed to the downside as stagflation risks continue to increase,” wrote Barclays’ Maneesh Deshpande. “While we cannot discount sharp bear market rallies, we think upside is limited.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a wild week, as investors weighed the prospects of rising interest rates against the potential of slower economic growth.
*****
&gt; Last week, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.54%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow dropped 0.21% and 0.24%, respectively. It was the sixth straight losing week for the Dow, and the fifth straight for the other two major indexes.
*****
&gt; While the cumulative moves for the week were not out of the ordinary, some of the day-to-day swings were eye-popping. The Dow had its best day since 2020 on Wednesday, but then erased all those gains and more on Thursday.
*****
&gt; The short-lived Wednesday rally came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was not considering a 75-basis-point rate hike at upcoming meetings. Stocks and bonds rallied following that comment but reversed course on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper told CNBC’s Scott Wapner on Friday that Powell’s statement was an “unforced error” that contributed to market volatility.
*****
&gt; “Our thinking is that stocks are likely to continue lower because we have not yet seen enough technical evidence to suggest a bottom process has started,” wrote JC O’Hara of MKM Partners. “Technical indicators are not oversold enough. The volume profile has shown little if any signs of real capitulation.”
*****
&gt; First-quarter earnings season is slowing down, but there are several notable reports before the opening bell on Monday, including Palantir and vaccine-makers BioNTech and Novavax.
*****
&gt; In other corporate news, Ford was looking to sell 8 million shares in Rivian Automotive over the weekend, sources told CNBC’s David Faber.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be keeping an eye on the war in Ukraine. U.S. first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to the country on Sunday. The U.S. and Group of Seven countries announced that they would increase short-term financial support for Ukraine as the war with Russia nears the three-month mark.

personalfinance,Is buying a house now FOMO? Or a sound financial decision?,"I’m a little bit torn about wether or not buying a house at the peek of the market makes sense. I can afford it and I (supposedly) locked in a pretty decent rate (4.5%). 

What irks me is looking back at the price history of houses and seeing that they went for literally half their current asking price a year ago. Most of what I read says that experts don’t expect a major correction, just a stabilization. I wonder however if the people making these predictions are involved in the housing industry and are just trying to keep their industry going.

On the other hand, it seems real estate goes up during periods of inflation? 

I’ve considered just putting my cash in the market, I have a good emergency fund. The only problem is if housing prices do correct, I need a lot of cash for a down payment as interest rates will be high at that point!

I don’t agree as in both of these instances there was Fed policy and in 2020, fiscal policy to the rescue of the economy and stock market.

 Bill Dudely, former New York Fed President, said there is an “almost zero” chance that the Fed will avoid a recession. The Fed is choosing inflation to fight, at least for the moment, despite the growing risks of a recession. The TED measures the interest rates on T bonds and interbank loans. Since mid-April, it has seen a 15% increase. Previous spikes signaled the economic crisis in 2006-2008.

bonds,Still not jumping back into bonds,"I'm retired.  My current situation is that if I can realize a 3.5% annual return I'm ok financially from ""now on"".  

I have a bond ladder (longest maturing is 4 years out - I added to it in May 2020 so yields are ok) as well as a fairly significan cash position.  Looking at bills/notes/bonds, corporate bonds and bond funds there are a number of instruments that now currenty offer those sort of returns.  

However my feeling is that markets HAVE NOT fully factored in the upcoming interest rate hikes and asset unwinding by the Fed.   Furthermore unless they have stored cash, some of the zombie corporations out there will experience more downside and maybe some solvency issues.

So my verdict is:  I'm not jumping into debt purchase just yet.  Any thoughts on this?

CryptoCurrency,I don't understand some people's strategy,"People who sell crypto now are very likely to do so at a loss: if they entered BTC below 32k, for example, they must have entered before January 2021 or July 2021 at the latest and held on until now - then it would be very unlikely that they have not sold before and are doing so now of all times. The question is: Why are so many people selling at a loss right now? Even if rising interest rates are expected and people need liquidity to buy e.g. treasury bonds - the interest rates for a 10-year US government bond should soon be between 3 and 4% - but what does that help if one now accepts a loss of 5% on crypto to get cash?",cryptocurrency,1652106122

Credit card debt: $25,000 @ 9%

Personal Loan for pool construction: $20,000 @ 6%

Income: $130,000 / yr for our family of 5.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to use the equity that's been building in our house.  A cash-out refi could get us enough money to pay off the credit card and pool loan.  Isn't this just transferring one loan to another though?  I suppose the interest rate would probably be better though.

If we moved, and downsized our house, we'd have tons of cash on hand.  But I'd rather not do that if I don't have to.  Any advice welcome.

personalfinance,401k Rollover being prevented due to company buyout?,"Let's see if I can explain this... I am unable to rollover my 401k bc the provider is saying I work for the same company, but I think the 401k provider is getting the timing incorrect in this unique situation.

Does anyone have any experience or input with the below:

\-I work for large company A

\-While working for company A, large company B decides to buy company A, but this has to go through regulatory review etc, and will take time.

\-In the meantime, the contract project I work on is awarded to company B.  I am terminated from company A and picked up by company B for the same project.

\-Official acquisition of company A from company B is weeks after my termination date.

The 401k provider, in their system, doesn't seem to understand I terminated from company A.   I tried explaining the situation but of course, they can't do anything as I am coded into the system for no distribution/rollover, understandable.

Any idea about this, or what to do?

EDIT: After talking to the plan administator sadly I got screwed, imo, on this.  There was a small window I would have been able to rollout to my ira, but the federal ERISA commitee decided that due to the buyout all terminated employees of the old company who now work for the new parent company would not be able to rollout after the company buyout date, regardless of being terminated before the buyout date.  Of course no notice was sent to employees/former employees this was going on.  Pretty absurd imo and massive blow finacially.",finance,1652108098
personalfinance,"Pre-tax vs. Roth IRA, ESPP, and Student Loan Debt Questions","Hi all,

Recently graduated and now starting full-time at a large cybersecurity tech company that I interned with for a year leading up to my graduation. My company offers 50% match on pre-tax and/or Roth contributions, up to 2% of eligible compensation as part of the benefits package. The company additionally offers a 15% discount on its publicly-traded stock through its Employee Stock Purchasing Program (ESPP), up to $21150 per calendar year (25000 x 85%).

&amp;#x200B;

 I also accumulated a mixture of subsidized and unsubsidized student loans throughout my schooling totaling close to the average student loan amount per borrower (roughly $30k). The total loan amounts are split 55/45 between unsubsidized and subsidized loans, at 5.3% and 3.7% rates respectively. I am aware there is currently a 0% interest rate on all of these loans through August of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note, I also invest in a brokerage account (Webull, no more Robinhood for me) and currently contribute about $200/ month of my own cash into it. I am very interested in contributing to the ESPP as well, possibly taking 5-10% I would invest monthly into pre-tax and Roth and putting that into the ESPP. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few assumptions I am making about my future career trajectory, compensation, and debt:

* I plan on my total comp to increase &gt;10% within my first few years of working.
* I am assuming there would not be a waiver on any amount of my student loan debt in the near future (although I would gladly take some debt relief!)
* I can consolidate my public student loans through certain companies. SoFi is partnered with my company to give up to .375% off any eligible rate (I did a pre-approval calculation and it has me at 6.015% over 7 years, I prefer less total interest paid to an extent and higher monthly payments).
* I am not interested in the Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program. I am aware of the program, and think its incredibly valuable to those that qualify, but my current passion and interests is with large private-sector technology/ cybersecurity companies.

Thoughts or advice on how much I should invest into pre-tax versus Roth at my company? Also, thoughts or personal experiences with ESPP programs at companies? Furthermore, should I focus on paying off the debt quicker than 7 years (ranges from 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20+ year options, so quickest would be 5 years + any additional payments at 4.5% average interest rate)? The quicker debt payoff would mean less I can contribute to my 401k, ESPP, etc, possibly less ROI over time, but also much less risk (albeit lower loan interest rate).

stocks,Maybe the stock market has entered a bear market?,"Inflation overshoots the moderate inflation target by 1%, and short-term interest rates need to be raised by 1.5% to control. At present, the core inflation rate is at least four or five percentage points higher, and the benchmark interest rate can only be increased by 600-800 basis points. 50 basis points at a time is negligible, and 10 times of interest rate increase is not enough. The stock market running in a parallel universe may fall back to the earth.

The trend of U.S. stocks has made it difficult for investors who have enjoyed rising dividends for more than ten years to react, but they might as well guess boldly: Maybe U.S. stocks have entered a bear market cycle, and it is not impossible to fall back to ten or even twenty years ago",finance,1652108650
investing,At what level will we see capitulation?,"Buying the CoVID flash crash of 2020 turned out to (at least shortly after) be a really good dip buying opportunity.

everybody seems to know how much the Fed will do quantitive tightening per month, but nobody seems to be aware of any of their targets long-term. For example, we don’t know if they’ll be able to keep the course of unwinding $100 billion a month for six months, eight months, 12 months, 60 months.

their balance sheet was a little bit below $4 trillion before the pandemic, and it’s now currently closer to 9 trillion. There’s no data to prove this but I’m going to guess the Fed obviously has a desire to lower their balance sheet, and pre-pandemic levels could potentially be a good target. Meaning they have to unroll about $5 trillion, which at current rates would take about 50 months.

there is nothing that states all stock market price discovery should break over this. There’s nothing to say that companies will not make and grow earnings.

However, we’re obviously going through what seems like a correction. The joke around this sub has always been, if too many people are buying we’re at the top, and when people start making posts like this, we should be closer to the bottom.

all jokes aside since I’m not really interested in calling bottoms or timing or anything like that, I’m just curious where a “sane” level of “downtrend” makes sense.

do we revert to the mean of 15x P/E? i’m not exactly sure what price that puts us at. I will do the math later. that would be with trailing 12 month earnings, and if 20% of the companies in the S&amp;P (random number) fail to grow or even start to go backwards earnings wise, the valuation projection quickly becomes useless.

this form really hates to say numbers. They love by the dip. I love by the dip. I see how time in the market works. I’m not trying to time any markets.

just trying to have a conversation on what some eye opening numbers would be if you were to see them flash across your screen from a bottom prescriptive.

personalfinance,Surplus savings in a savings account - uncertain where to place it,"My partner and I have a (low) interest bearing savings account where we have over 6 months worth of income saved (approx. $60k USD).  The excess of this 6 months emergency fund is about $20k USD.

Given inflation and low interest rate in the account, I'm looking for suggestions on where I could park the additional funds.  I am a low-expense ratio, passive index investor. I max my 401k and my partner contributes heavily to their 401k. We both max / backdoor our Roth IRAs, and I also max my HSA for triple tax advantaged savings.

We could take these excess funds and put them in a index fund / ETF, but I am a bit hesitant.

1. If we have excess savings, this means my partner could be contributing more to their 401k. This doesn't change the fact that we have excess savings parked however.
2. We want to have money available for a potential down payment for a home in the 2-5 year time frame. We own right now but want to trade up. Maintaining liquidity and minimizing how much we borrow (say via a HELOC) for a down payment when we are ready is important. We would be willing to reduce that fund to 3months of savings rather than 6 to do this.
3. With inflation and economic uncertainly, I am hesitant to place this money elsewhere with a 2-5 year time horizon on the funds.  

Long story short, I have a bit of FOMO with excess savings sitting in a low-interest bearing savings account, but conflicted due to uncertain time horizon / need to access the funds given the risk of volatility.

Crypto isn’t going anywhere and you are here in the subreddit of my favorite one. We were on Times Square, wrote about in forbes and WSJ as a runner, landed FIFA as the biggest partner I’ve seen in crypto, and have a speculated Starbucks deal in the works (They will only take a green blockchain).

Good luck this run, and just remember there’s too much money on it now. If you think the VC’s involved in Algo didn’t tell their friends what FIFA or other pending partnerships at work were worth, you were wrong. They’re waiting for Wednesday, as crypto is ultimately very bullish when confronted with inflation. Nations were clawing for BTC to not collapse their own dollar 6 months ago, what happened? 8 Trillion dollars left the inflated markets of S&amp;p, DOW, housing, and tech the last 6 months.

However, i am clearly missing something and I would like you to educate me, since online I haven't find a satisfactory answer.


How is it possible for staking rewards to be so high for stablecoins? I frequently see ""just stake stablecoins for 20% apy"" as a recommended investment strategy. 


My understanding is that for POS coins, staking is remunerated by taking a fee from the transaction amount, and that when a website offer staking rewards what you are actually doing is not staking yourself but partecipating into a staking pool. 
That being said, are apy this high sustainable? Wouldn't this severely hinder the ability to transfer coins cheaply?


Also, why is that different pools pay different apys? I would except it to be roughly the same, meanwhile there can be some pretty significant differences.


Would it be possible that some pools are using staking as a way to finance themself by offering an interest rate that they will not be able to repay over the long term?",cryptocurrency,1652111622

During tax time this year, our account said that we are boarder line on getting a penalty for not paying our taxes quarterly. I owed over $4,000 in taxes for 2021. He said that I could report on my W2 single so more taxes would be withheld as a solution. 

I am paid biweekly and my federal tax withholding on my paycheck went up 2.5x. I changed the filing back to married filing jointly but the federal tax withholding has not changed - it's been over 2 months since I changed it. 

My question is, should the federal tax withholding on my paycheck drop back down to the married filing jointly level? Does my 2021 taxes impact the withholding? I did have a marginal raise but not one that would have such a huge impact on my paycheck federal withholding.

 I don't want to pay a penalty but I also don't want this much withheld from my paycheck. I dont mind owing and I would rather not have a refund. I already contacted my HR and they are saying that the reporting is married filing jointly, so not very helpful.

CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA+ Experiment - Week 29 Update,"This is a LONG overdue update as it's now been 3 weeks since the last time I posted on the project. Obviously a ton has changed since then and pretty much all of it is negative. This update will take a bit longer than most due to the fact that there's a lot of negative things to talk about and I'm also recapping 3 weeks worth of purchases/staking/interest rewards rather than just a single week like normal. Rest assured, though, for those of you who have been following the project, I haven't given up, I'm still making my purchases but my time to post had been pretty limited lately so I didn't get a chance to update anything on Reddit.

For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix  of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi)  as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the community  to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my own  research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some DD. I  have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous posts  and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be chosen by  the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end of the  experiment. For the starting point you can look here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u4nq15/1\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment\_week\_26\_update/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u4nq15/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_26_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

As I stated in my intro, things are looking pretty bleak. Not just in the crypto world but the broader macro world as well. Interest rates are headed up with no near term end to the increases in sight. Inflation is raging. There's still a major war going on in Ukraine that is going to affect global food stores in the very near future. Gas prices are raging out of control. My 401k is down over 10% year to date, the stock of the tech company I work for is down over 35% year to date, the NASDAQ, Dow and S&amp;P are all in miserable territory, etc. It really should be no surprise that the crypto market is down like it is given everything going on around us. It still sucks though!

The positive here is this was always meant to be a long term investment. I am looking out at least 5-10 years with everything I'm doing both in crypto and the stock market, so I'll take advantage of this opportunity to keep buying into the projects I believe in at what appear to be excellent buying prices across the board.

Let's dive into the financials. I'm going to mix up the order a bit because I think given my hiatus it's a good idea to look at the overall chart first, followed by the coins I purchased in the last 3 weeks before diving into the current standings table. So, here's what the chart looks like today:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j02es7b37hy81.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f51960893392dd775e97313065251765690fcfd

Those last 3 weeks look tragic. As you can see, all of the coins are now negative with the sole exception being BUSD which I'm hosting on BlockFi and collecting interest on. Honestly, the most disheartening coin for me on this chart is LUNA. As recently as early April it was up over 75% and even last week when I didn't provide an update, it was still up over 20%. It's still in first place among the competitive coins, but it's sad to see even my top dog in the red. Let's hope we can get some positive news here over the next couple of weeks to turn some of these trend lines around.

The other really troubling piece of this is if you look at the price of BTC (thick purple line) over the course of this experiment relative to the overall gain/loss of the experiment (thick dashed blue-grey line) I've been beating the price of BTC almost the whole time. It's now less than a 2% difference as the alts have been getting crushed even harder than BTC and ETH have.

Next I'll get into the purchases and interest/staking rewards since the last update. Typically this is a small table but given that it's been 3 weeks since I provided an update and it just happens that the past 2 weeks were both control weeks, I've got 18 purchases and 5 staking/interest rewards to update, so this chart is much larger than it's ever been. I've broken out each week's purchases separately so you can see the buy price for each week individually. The stuff I purchased this week came at a pretty big discount over a week ago.

https://preview.redd.it/qyjxeklb7hy81.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a0b2b9c57df865a6299a6027f9f29b337daffea

Now that we've gotten through those, I'm going to put the main tracking table that I usually lead with each week. Since I hadn't been posting, I had to go calculate the last 2 weeks first in order to update the chart and calculate this week's week/week numbers, so these are based on where the portfolio was at last week versus this week, even though I didn't provide an update last week.

https://preview.redd.it/06tdd8fj7hy81.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f34b234b48da3a9185396b4a771075a50f31d7

As you can see, things are not going well. For context, as of April 2nd the overall portfolio was up 2.77%. Last week (just 1 month later) when I didn't provide an update, the portfolio was down just over 30%, which was the worst it had been over the entire course of the experiment. As bad as that seemed, here we are today, just 1 week later and now we're down over 40%. Things are spiraling out of control quickly. This is disheartening, but I already talked earlier about the broader macro environment. The reality is that when things are going badly in the economy and stock market the things that take the biggest hits are the most speculative assets like tech stocks and crypto. My core position is not changed. I don't think anything about crypto or the underlying technology in these projects has changed. What's changed is that people don't have the free money to spend like they used to and institutional investors are moving into safer investments. At some point this ship will turn itself around and in the meantime I'm going to keep on buying.

As for the individual coins, where to even begin? There's not a positive story anywhere in that table. Only 3 coins are down less than 10% week over week (and even then, just barely). Every competitive coin in the portfolio is down over 10%, most of them are in the 40-55% down range. FTM is still bringing up the rear as it has been for the past few months. The biggest non-macro story in the list is probably CRO which had been one of my better coins until they decided they hated their customer base. 35% down week over week makes sense with an announcement like that.

One last closing note on the progress so far. Since I had skipped a few weeks, we're now well into the second half of the experiment. At this point there are just 23 remaining weeks to go in the purchasing phase and then it's another year of growth to determine the winning coin. Let's hope BUSD doesn't stay in front.

Finally, as always you can see real-time status of the experiment by following this link to CoinGecko:  [https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolios/public/pokoire-1-year-dca-experiment](https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolios/public/pokoire-1-year-dca-experiment) where you can see  updates of the doughnut chart below.

CryptoCurrency,"Now is a great time to buy, BUT...","So over the last several weeks I keep seeing posts saying 'NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY!', 'THE BOTTOM IS IN' blappity blah blah, and things just kept on dropping. Sure, prices are great now, and like people are saying that these are the times where you really benefit from investing. I just want to throw a couple things out there, and that's:

1. Just because you buy at the current low prices, things are most likely going to fall further. We are in uncharted times right now. Governments WAY over-printed money without thinking of the consequences and let's face it, inflation and rising interest rates will be in our future for a while which effects us crypto-dorks negatively. Recovery will NOT happen overnight, over the week, over the next month, hell, we might be in this for months so even though you read all the posts to BUY NOW, just relax and know we're not getting out of this any time soon. Don't make pressured decisions because of some dumb post and feel like shit because it dipped after you bought the dip. Be tranquilo my friends.
2. Even though prices are low, just because you stack your favourite project DOES NOT MEAN you're guaranteed to make crazy profits when the market recovers. Crypto is still kind of a gamble, nobody knows what's going to moon, what's going to sink, who's going to sign a deal with a huge corporation out of the blue, etc. Like I mentioned in the above point, we're going to be in this shit for a while so maybe take your time and do some research on other projects! Join some subs, find out what you like and don't like, and maybe you'll fall in love with something new that you never would have found out about in a green market where you're only hyper-focused on what you own. It never hurts to try something new so give it a shot! Right now is the perfect time to DYOR because believe me, ain't nothing good gonna happen for a while.
3. If you lost faith in a project, there is NOTHING wrong with selling and buying into something new or re-investing that money into something you already have faith in. I really hate this sentiment of 'you only lose money if you sell' because it's complete bullshit. You only lose your money if you PULL OUT OF THE MARKET. You can sell but as long as you reinvest, you're still in the game. Honestly my best buys have been selling when I'm down, I've made thousands selling projects that I didn't believe in anymore and reinvesting into something new which quickly rocketed. Could it be dumb luck? Maybe, but it's happened to me two or three times in the last year so I think that kinda X's out the luck part of it. Like I said, right now is a good time to buy, but it's also a great time to restructure your portfolio and move some things around.

Well, there you go, just the ramblings of a random dummy on the internet.

personalfinance,"Signed ReFi Agreement 2 days after unexpectedly losing job, now mortgage co wants to redo it","Hi All,

As the title states, I refinanced my condo in a mid-sized metro area last year. While the deal was in the final stretch, I was unexpectedly and unceremoniously let go from my job. Literally 2 days before closing. I was pretty shell shocked and more than a little worried about paying the bills, but since I knew I'd have some time before my next mortgage payment afterward, I went through with it without disclosing my employment status. 

I ended up being unemployed for about 6 weeks, make all my mortgage payments on time and think nothing of it. This was last February ('21). My loan was sold and became the property of a large and faceless bank around July of last year. In January '22, I got a call from the original mortgage provider that they needed information about my employment history - I replied that my loan was no longer held by them and that was that. They reached out one more time, but I didn't respond and all was quiet.

Then March rolls around and I got a call from the broker who originated my loan. They are telling me that the new owner of the loan wants to cancel it and foreclose because technically my employment wasn't what was stated on closing. They are insisting that I need to reapply for a new loan in order to make the situation 'go away'. I haven't had any communication from either my current loan owner of the previous loan owner, but they broker is making it sound like I am likely to get sued for fraud and my home will be foreclosed upon.

It wouldn't be a huge setback save for the fact that interest rates have shot up so fast that I'll be paying almost double (4.99% vs 2.85%) if I go through with it.

Should I contact my current mortgage holder for direction? The original party who reached out to me? Am I totally fucked regardless?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you",finance,1652118652

CryptoCurrency,"Misconceptions I keep seeing about the economy and stress factors on the crypto and stock markets. They have some truths behind them, but often get twisted. Here's some of the misconceptions cleared up with data.","# 1- Myth: Inflation will cause investors to run away from investments and turn to cash.

Short term maybe, but that's not entirely true.

You can't rely on cash, when the value of that cash is dropping at a faster rate right now.

Inflation makes moving out of investments unattractive.

On top of that, despite raised rates, returns on savings and CDs are abysmal. Inflation is at 8% while a 5 year CD will at best give you around 2%.

If you want growth, you can't rely on cash, bonds, or even safe investments when inflation is this high. You have to consider riskier investments.

What is happening short term, is people may be temporarily turning to cash during the current panic. But they can't do that for too long.

# 2- Myth: Gold is king right now.

It should be.

Surprisingly, gold hasn't been performing that great, despite all the conditions ripe for it. Even when we had the height of the pandemic, Evergrande fears, war, inflation running high, it has only briefly broken above $2K, only to dip back to $1.8K.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gold price\/oz](https://preview.redd.it/2yfiww69lhy81.jpg?width=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1017990eb5ac4ebe1fcde816c4752635ada9b6ae)

And both gold and silver are still dropping right now.

Metals is a very manipulated market right now, especially silver. So the price may not reflect the most accurate picture.

It's still a solid store of value long term. But not quiet the king right now.

# 3- Myth: Crypto is 1:1 and in synch with stocks.

That's only partially true, some of the time.

Crypto doesn't have a 1.0 correlation to stocks.

It's been mostly around a 0.5 correlation, which is a moderate correlation. Sometimes dropping around 0.4.

At very best it's been around 0.6. In fact, we've only had the highest correlation breaking above 0.6 in the past week.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin correlation to the S&amp;P 500](https://preview.redd.it/qvvcp6pfihy81.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21c16b5b614fab137343447b1f2b5ae8771ed0dd)

&amp;#x200B;

There is still some degree of correlation that can't be ignored either.

But it's not usually that strong nor consistent.

It's not always even consistent with major stock market moves.

Earlier this year when stocks had a major dip into correction territory for the first time, Bitcoin went up.

# 

# 4- Myth: Fed rates are rising to unprecedented levels, making the cost of borrowing too high.

It's true that Fed rates are rising, but at still historically low rates.

They are only rising to a targeted 2%. Which is simply going to pre-covid rates. So the cost of borrowing will still be cheap, and savings/CDs will still have abysmal returns.

What did alarm markets is that it's increasing rapidly, because we are going from near 0 to 2%.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5- Myth: Wall Street is worried about average Joe having to pay more for Mcdonalds and gas at the station.

Queue gif of rich people laughing. Those aren't the biggest problems Wall Street is worried about. It may in fact offer more opportunities for them, and even widen the wealth gap long term.

Wall Street is a supply and demand game.

And not a supply and demand of main street.  It's a supply and demand of stocks, options contracts, and derivatives. Which should be connected to main street, but aren't as much as we would expect.

It's more about whether the supply and demand for those contracts become more attractive. Is it time to short or go long? It's a see saw game. Shorts and longs get overbought then oversold, and get liquidated. And on and on it goes, back and forth.

What average Joe is paying at the gas station isn't necessarily bad for Wall Street. It may be something good for their options contract. It may be an opportunity to invest in oil companies.

Sometimes Wall Street can be very much out of synch with main street. Like they're almost two different worlds.

# 6- Myth: Macros are the drivers and mean everything for crypto and stocks.

This is only partially true.

It's not unusual for macros to take a back seat.

Especially the way markets work nowadays.

Just like how main street can be very much out of synch with Wall Street, macro economics can take a back seat as the main factor in trading.

Bots, quants, investors, are more worried about how other bots, quants, are trading, and the internal supply and demand of the market. The trends, what contracts are overbought or oversold.

Macros come second. That's why you can have world disasters and still have stocks or crypto go up.

Crypto example:

A perfect case for this was when we had China banning crypto miners, followed by the fear of Evergrande defaulting. A double whammy of negative macros. But Bitcoin ignored it and went From $35K to $50K.

# 7- Myth: War in Ukraine is a guaranteed recession for markets.

This is not necessarily wrong, it's more a case of nobody knows for sure.

We don't even know how long it's gonna last, or how it's gonna play out.

It could end in 2 weeks, or it would end in 2 years.

The uncertainty is the factor here.

If we lose the factor of uncertainty, whether it's the war turning into a small conflict, more certainty about the outcome, or if it were to end, it would lift the big cloud of uncertainty over the market.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8- Myth: Dipping this hard definitely means we are heading into a crypto winter and into a stock market recession.

It could be true, but it's not an automatic.

We have dipped this hard many times, only to find a new ATH.

We have even dipped on worse macro news, and recovered.

With Fed's more hawkish tone, and businesses and supply chains picking up again, there could be conditions for stocks picking up eventually.

Especially if the dark clouds on the market and uncertainty were to be lifted. If the war in Ukraine were to end, or if inflation were to stabilize.

Crypto crashing is definitely not something out of the ordinary for its volatile market. In fact, it can even crash hard, multiple times, even in the middle of a bull cycle.

In fact, in 2013, crypto crashed nearly 50%, and had 5 months of a mini bear market, in the middle of its bull cycle.

Of course, we don't know yet. So we can't jump to conclusions either way.

We'll know when it's too late, or when we start having lower lows below $28K.

&amp;#x200B;

# 9- Fact: We are experiencing a supply crunch in liquidity.

There is still one genuine concern.

And this may have been the real driver all along.

The Fed printers have been creating an artificial extra supply of liquidity, which have likely helped prop up stocks and even crypto during the last 2 years.

Cutting off the extra supply, and going right back to normal, does create a shock for the market.

This may be why we are seeing these big dips.

It's a correction to the supply.

It's definitely a downturn and an adjustment. Whether it's only a correction, or a catalyst for a crypto winter and stock recession, that remains to be seen.",cryptocurrency,1652119434
stocks,How could anyone be bullish?,"Another recession is on its way and I don’t know how anyone could be bullish at this point. Supply shocks from the war in Ukraine have sent U.S. gas prices reeling from sanctions against Russia. Gas is almost at a whopping $6/gal in California and has broken a record average of $4.31/gal across the states. Additionally, famines and food shoratges will be happening worldwide due to the war. Even worse, Putin has shown no signs of stopping the war as evident from his speech today. Even if he wanted to make a peace treaty with Ukraine, it isn’t in his or Russia’s best interest politically. Putin wants to project a strongman image for himself and Russia. I believe he has invested himself too deep into Ukraine to withdraw now and make himself and his regime look weak.

This is all happening while many developed nations are experiencing unsustainable economic growth. From an American perspective (before COVID-19), the U.S. economy was experiencing enormous economic growth and a dangerously low unemployment rate as a result of the Trump administration’s tax cuts and deregulation (&lt;4%). This low unemployment rate is an indicator of demand pull inflation, an unhealthy phenomenon that can lead to a potential recession. Furthermore, when COVID-19 hit the states, it exacerbated this problem when the fed started to print money, sending inflation through the roof. And now a hawkish fed is hiking interest rates at unprecedented levels to finally start tackling this problem. I believe that this was too late and wasn’t enough to reign in inflation. I foresee higher interest rate hikes in the future as Americans really start to hurt from inflation and the war. Additionally, Biden’s fiscal policy and foreign aid to Ukraine certainly doesn’t help with this economic crisis.

The U.S. isn’t the only ones experiencing this phenomenon. Worldwide, states are hiking interest rates to control inflation. It’s only a matter of time before this delicate house of cards we call the world economy comes crashing down.",finance,1652121330

The crypto market and stock market follow similar trends, but crypto often jumps and falls more radically.  S&amp;P 500 will continue to fall, but it won't fall at the rate of crypto.

personalfinance,Opinions on using 0% financing incentive from the gas company to convert from oil to gas?,"Hey all, new homebuyer here trying to lean on the experience of others and to get different perspectives to avoid any bad or uninformed decisions.

My wife &amp; I recently purchased a home in NJ that currently runs off oil. It's a larger home (2,800 sqft) and for efficiency purposes, we want to convert from oil to gas. This aspect seems like a no brainer, gas is far more efficient than oil, so I'm good on that end. But the cost of doing so seems extreme. We only need to pay to have it connected to our house (gas company pays to run a line from the street to the house), but all the pricing estimates I'm seeing online runs from 6-15k.

We are comfortable financially (we did have to dip into our emergency fund to get a better interest rate, but the mortgage is 24% of our monthly income, 47% take home after 401k/HSA/Roth IRA deductions etc), but we are trying to build up our emergency fund again while doing necessary repairs on the home (she's a solid fixer upper), so keeping cash on hand is pretty important.

Our gas company offers 0% financing incentive for 7 years on energy efficiency conversions like ours - now, on the surface, that seems like a no brainer to utilize. Especially since the yearly savings of using gas vs oil will be about $500/year, it will pay for itself. But I'm worried about adding extra debt to our new giant pile of mortgage debt and adding another monthly payment to the mix. There are no prepayment penalties so we can pay it off quicker as we finish the necessary home projects.

Or maybe this is what the fund managers do behind the scenes so I don't have to do anything? 

My rationale is that when the rates are up, bonds' prices will go down. So selling now will avoid me having to endure my investments' fall in value. Buying later however will allow me to get shares at a lower price, with expectations of more important returns.

stocks,"Saudis Drastically Cut Oil Prices to China -- Implication for oil stocks, inflation?","[According to Bloomberg \(non pay walled\):
](https://archive.ph/fMQ2v)
&gt; Saudi Arabia cut oil prices for buyers in Asia as coronavirus lockdowns in China weigh on demand, countering uncertainty around Russia’s supplies as the Ukraine war drags on.

&gt; Saudi Aramco is lowering prices for the first time in four months. The state-controlled company dropped its key Arab Light crude grade for next month’s shipments to Asia to $4.40 a barrel above the benchmark it uses, from $9.35 in May. That’s in line with a Bloomberg survey of refiners and traders from late April that forecast a $5 decrease.

I've invested a lot in oil stocks (Coterra, Pioneer, Devon especially). So I was wondering:

* Many analysts still say this is just a small blip on our way to a long ""super cycle"" of sustained high oil prices. Do you agree? 

* Why did Saudi Arabia decides to make this huge cut (from $9.35 to $4)? Is this good for tech stock in general? Does it signal good news -- oil prices coming down maybe Fed will slow down? Or is it bad news -- **China recession is terrible and it has spooked the Saudis.**

I closed my short position on the Nasdaq. The market right now is discounting inflation, China lockdowns and Ukraine war. 

The inflation is due to the commodities crisis and the only solution is to increase the global supply, not to restrict it ever more by banning more and more countries from international markets because otherwise you need to destroy demand to reach a new equilibrium at that lowered supply level and that will cause a global recession with collapsing stock markets worldwide. Nobody wants it. 

The lockdown in China will probably end at the end of May no matter the number of cases. They are decreasing but that zero Covid policy is dumb because Omicron spread much faster than the original variant and China can't allow its economy to be in lockdown for many months. The residents of Shanghai are getting increasingly frustrated and are now openly protesting it...even for China locking people down for months it's too much.

And the war in Ukraine I think it's gonna last for many months. Putin has made it clear it now wants the Donbass and all the Southern part and that will take time because they aren't mobilizing anybody and aren't carpet bombing anything. If you want to run a surgically precision campaign by limiting civilian losses you need to be prepared for a long campaign.  This will affect markets negatively because volatility will remain high. 

I think we may have a short rally next week, but medium term the outlook remains negative because the biggest problem (supply led inflation) won't be resolved and there is no plan to fix it.

personalfinance,"Theorycrafting the Buy, Borrow, Die strategy","So I have recently become fascinated by the Buy, Borrow, Die (BBD)strategy of tax avoidance. I know it is a strategy many billionaires use but I am curious if it is feasible on a smaller scale. I am familiar with the basic strategy but get hung up when thinking about the nuts and bolts of putting the plan into action. 

For example:
Lets assume I have 2.5 million dollars invested in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. Lets also assume I would like $100,000 a year to live on via this BBD method. So I set up a Securities back line of credit (SBLOC) for $500K for 5 years and withdraw $100K plus enough to cover the interest for the first year (so 100K plus 8K assuming an 8% interest rate, 108K total). That leaves me with $392K in available credit. The next year I pull another 108K out of the SBLOC leaving me with $284K in available credit. The 4th year I Pull another 108K our leaving me with 176K. Finally the 5th year I pull the last 108K our and start the process of starting another loan. 

5 years have now passed and the 2.5 million in the S&amp;P could be worth 4 Million assuming a 10% compounding rate. My worry now is I now have to take out a 1 million dollar loan against this to pay of the original 500K back, then resume my 100K a year lifestyle. My debt-to-securities ratio is now 25% instead of 20% and I am now forced to take out 40K (not including the current years interest) per year in interest which cuts down the length I could maintain this loan significantly. Am I missing something or did I do the math wrong? This doesn't seem maintainable. 
Also does anyone have experience with SBLOCs? Are they usually interest only or are they paid like a mortgage is IE with principal and interest done monthly? Also is it wiser to do this strategy with SBLOCS or should one try it with other property like real estate? Any pointers or corrections to my assumptions or just tips on how to plan this better would be appreciated.

CryptoCurrency,Power to the people- but how?,"Many people found their way to crypto fed up of the old world. They left the stock market, that is full of manipulation by whales and interference by the governments only to find out, that there’s no difference in the crypto market. 

From crash to crash, mostly the big whales increase their influence, because while the standard cryptoholder may not always have cash to buy in the lows, the institutional investor and big individuals always have more money to increase their holdings. An even more manipulated market, tuned to their needs, follows.

So what can we as small fish do against that unwanted development?

1. Do your research

Look up, how decentralized your next coin really is, how much of the coins are in the hand of a few whales or the devs- because you may be their exit liquidity. 

2. Try to switch to the native ecosystems of coins instead of using centralized exchanges to use your coin

When you use your coins for example for staking in ecosystems like Cosmos or Polkadot, always  try to use small validators to keep the system split up in many small sums, because when the big validators get too strong, they can rig governance proposals for their favor  for example or have too much control on the price development

solar,Sizing system for a house I am buying? [Southern CA],"I live in a 3 bed apartment in Los Angeles (El Segundo), approximately 1350 sq ft. I use a lot of electricity compared to my peers thanks to a bevy of electronics and a love of central AC. I run AC even in the late fall/early spring as the equipment I have tends to heat the place much faster than a normal person's home. I use anywhere from 600 kWh in the winter to 900 kWh in the summer (an average bill with SCE of $200 on their tiered usage plan).

I am moving to a 2-story house in the San Fernando Valley/Santa Clarita area (\~3500 sq ft) at the beginning of June. Knowing that the climate is warmer than here by the beach, I expect my AC usage to increase non-linearly with area. My partner and I still have ICE vehicles, but I expect in the next decade we will upgrade to electric. I also anticipate my device usage (homelabs, computers, home theater, arcade cabs, etc) to increase as we expand into the new house.

Having said all that, I am unsure how to estimate my usage and provide reasonable details for quotes. To get the ball rolling with EnergySage and get some quotes in, I assumed my average power bill would double to 400, but maybe I should anticipate even higher? With SCE, I've read that if you size your system too large, they won't allow you to participate in net metering, which sounds ridiculous but I'm still learning. What I do know is that I want to get solar installed ASAP once I move, as the federal tax credit is still high and NEM 2.0 is still in effect.

Also, what are people's thoughts on batteries, given my situation? In my EnergySage RFQ, I have asked for quotes with and without batteries. They seem absolutely necessary under NEM 3.0, but maybe not as financially sound under 2.0?

Edit: The $400/mo estimate in EnergySage resulted in a monthly approximation of about 2000 kWh, and I'm getting quotes for systems in the 14-16 kW range.",energy,1652139948

The Fed created a situation that allowed markets to become extremely leveraged. Look at the [Pandemic-Era Federal Reserve Facilities](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pandemic-era-Federal-Reserve-Facilities.png) and you'll notice once The Fed made their support known in March and April the Recovery Started \[**March-20** &amp; **April-20**\].

The market becomes move and more leveraged as time goes on until **Oct-21** when [The Fed Says it Could Begin Tapering Process by November](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/federal-reserve-releases-minutes-from-its-september-policy-meeting.html). Markets finally start to deleverage once The FED states that it will [Begin Tapering](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20211103a.htm) in **Nov-21**.

My point in writing this is not about timing the market, but about making people understand the mechanics of what is happening:

&gt;But this is how margin debt and the stock market feed each other: Surging stock prices give people the urge to pile in, and they borrow money to do so, which drives up stock prices even further. But when the rally ends and stocks head south in a significant manner, and when people are highly leveraged, they will unload stocks to pay down their margin debt, and some will be forced to do so, and this drives down stock prices further.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://bit.ly/3L4weVb](https://bit.ly/3L4weVb)

However, the driving factor in all this is Monetary Policy because Margin Rates are usually based on Prime + Percentage. So, as Rates Increase the Margin Rates increase which means people are less likely to Buy on Margin which puts downward pressure on prices, which feeds into the vicious cycle mentioned above. Not only that, but DCF Valuation change once interest rate changes. Meaning, now everyone has to revaluate company fundamentals - and no one knows exactly when interest rates will stop rising or when.

The point is that it doesn't matter how strong the overall macroeconomy is or the company - stocks could still decrease because of market deleveraging. It could be that inflation has peaked, real wages increase, and the overall macroeconomy remains relatively strong. However, it won't matter - even in that situation stocks will continue to decline so long as Rates Increases.

\------------

**TL;DR** \- Monetary Policy and interest rates are more important for stock market Bears vs. Bulls than macroeconomic or company fundamentals when interest rates are *changing*. The only way to properly price a company based on fundamentals is when interest rates are neutral. *Changes* in interest rates create shock events - positive or negative - that change The Market. Until rates become neutral, and The Market fully adjusts to the new equilibrium, there *will* be more pain.",finance,1652141251

Right now the fed has to make a decision, which looks bad for investors either way.

Either way the economy will be screwed by inflation or debt.",finance,1652141426

personalfinance,Look at your amortization schedule if you have a home mortgage or are weighing buying vs renting,"People often make claims about the benefits of buying versus renting without understanding how mortgages are amortized. Here is a simple example: Let's say you borrow $700,000 to buy a house with a 30 year fixed-rate of 5%. At the start, only $841 (22.4%) of your $3,757.75 monthly payment (note: principal and interest only; not including insurance, taxes, HOA, PMI if applicable...) goes toward the principal. It would take over 16 years until half of the monthly payment went toward the principal. So a loan that starts in June 2022 would only be 50% principal, 50% interest in August 2038. It takes over 20 years for the principal to be halved (to $350,000, in this example); that is July 2042. In the first year, of the $45,093 in payments, only $10,328 goes toward principal.

personalfinance,Not receiving money after 8 business days wire transfer from Discover Bank,"Hi, I'm here for any suggestions and help. I never know the wire transfer from Discover could be so slow!!!

On 4/28/2022, I initiated a wire transfer of $240,500 from Discover bank to my Chase account. But today is 05/09/2022, I still do not receive the money. All wire transfer information has been verified many times with Discover. They are ALL correct.

I'm been told that I should receive the money within 1-2 business days when I first initiated this wire transfer. I also checked online, the domestic wire transfer time is typically within 3 business days at most. I think my situation is abnormal and really worried about my money.

I called Discover Bank on the 3rd business day (05/02/2022) when I realized that the money didn't arrive in my chase account as expected. The Discover told me that the Federal Reserve had held the money for doing some verifications and released the fund on 05/02/2022 already, I should receive the money within 1-2 business days right after 05/02/2022.

On 05/04/2022, the money was still not shown on my chase account. I called Discover customer service again. They kept saying the money already left their bank, it was not their fault for not receiving the money, and they don't know what's the current status of the money, only the Federal Reserve can provide trace information. So, I asked them to ask Federal Reserve for the trace information immediately. They told me they did, and I need to wait another 3-5 business days for getting a response from Federal Reserve. In the meanwhile, I found a hotline from Federal Reserve about solving wire transfer issues, they told me that they can't process the case directly from customers, I have to let Discover call them! So, I called Discover immediately to ask them to call this hotline. But Discover REFUSE to do that, they said they are not allowed to call Federal Reserve, they can only email them which will take 3-5 business days to get a response!!! (What's the point of setting up that hotline if the Bank has the regulation to not call?!!). This is so disappointing. It looks like Discover doesn't want to solve any issues that their customers encounter. Anyways, I still kept calling Discover customer service on the following weekdays, even though they kept telling me exactly the same information - ""We are doing nothing wrong... You should wait for another 3-5 business days for getting a response from Federal Reserve.... Without the response from Federal Reserve, we can't proceed to make any further actions..."" Looks like, they just blame everything on Federal Reserve....

On 05/09/2022, I called discover again and again. The first representative gave exactly the same information as last week, but the second representative double-checked emails and found out the Federal Reserve already replied to their email on 05/04/2022! (exactly the same day they sent the request!!) They just let me wait 4 days for NOTHING! How they didn't even notice that the Federal Reserve had replied to them, not to mention that I called them every day to have them check their emails?!!!! But they still don't know the trace. Why? Because they didn't actually ask for a trace, even though they told me they did... Today I requested them to ask for the trace information again and type the word trace in the email. They told me ""Please wait for 3-5 business days to get a response from Federal Reserve"" .......

Communicating with Discover wire transfer customer services is so desperate. It makes me feel that Discover just hire some people to make you not call them anymore. The money was supposed to be used for the house closing. Today is the close date, the money is still missing. I don't know where it is and when it will arrive. Whether or not I can still buy a house successfully. I did everything I can do on my side - call Discover, call Chase, call Federal Reserve, file complaints on CFPB, etc. I don't know what else I can do to make the process faster and get my money back!

# UPDATES:

On 05/17/2022, I finally received the fund! The fund had never been sent to Federal Reserve before 05/17/2022. There is a corresponding bank between Discover and Federal Reserve. In my case, the corresponding bank is NY Mellon. Somehow, NY Mellon withheld my money for more than 18 days!!!! Federal Reserve is fast, Chase is fast, but NY Mellon is slow!!! 

Whenever I called Discover, the customer service kept telling me that the wire transfer path is Discover -&gt; Federal Reserve -&gt; Chase. IN FACT, the wire transfer path is:  Discover -&gt; corresponding bank  -&gt; Federal Reserve -&gt; Chase.  I'm still confused why they were so sure that the money has already been released by Federal Reserve, all the information they provided is WRONG! There must be some miscommunications internally, and the customer service team totally knows nothing about Discover's wire transfer business.",finance,1652147023

stocks,Hedging for further 5% downside,"I took a look at my long portfolio yesterday and YTD I'm about 9% down and portfolio is moving around 0.8 beta compared to SPY. 

I figured that if I see green today or tomorrow I could hedge my portfolio to max further 5% drop by selling call at or above or my entry price point and buying  PUT 3-5% below current price to mitigate any capital losses below that point in credit.

I'm looking hedge just past next fed meeting so likely looking at 45 day mark or even 90 if can do that with credit. 

Obviously downside of this is if tomorrow we start a mega rally I'm going miss all the upside. I think we might see S&amp;P500 at 3000 before we see 4800 again and therefore im looking hedge expecially because just became a dad and cannot do active portfolio management due to lack of time in next few months.

personalfinance,How to think about big purchases given current economic climate?,"I have been wondering what an appropriate mental model should be regarding big purchases/cash expenditures given the current high inflation, rising interest rates, correctionary stock market environment.

As a working example, I have some money that I had been saving for some major purchases (home improvement, somewhat extravagant vacation, etc) from before the start of the year. This is savings after taking care of all the more pressing things (I've somewhat religiously followed the prime directive on this sub for a while so I'm all squared away on debts, retirement accounts, etc).

However these anticipated purchases are all things I view to be luxuries I can either live without or postpone until it makes more sense. I can take a smaller local vacation, for example. All else being equal, I had been intending to make these purchases after I'd saved up enough. But with so many drastic changes since the start of the year I'm unsure of how to proceed.

So I guess I'm basically wondering ""Is now a good or bad time to take a bunch of cash I have saved and spend it?"" Or what things should I be considering when deciding whether it's a good time?

The alternative to spending it, I assume, is investing in broad market index funds and then... at some point I'd feel comfortable spending money again? I don't know when that would be. In case it's not obvious, this may be my first recession as a working adult.",finance,1652161297

solar,Wuestions about nyc solar,"I have 2 inquiries about going solar in nyc, first I got 2 quotes which I am trying to decide:  
  
***Quote #1*** \- Gross: 38,063 - 11kw - 3.45/watt - 26x SunPower M425  
  
\-2,210 NYSUN, -9,321.78 ITC, -5,000 NYSERDIA, -7,170.6 nyc property  
  
Net Total: 14,360.62 - 1.30/watt  
  
***Quote #2*** \- Gross: 31,642 - 10kw - 3.14/watt - 28x Hanwha Q. Peak Duo BLK G10+ and SolarEdge inverter and Optimizer  
  
\-2,210 NYSUN, -7,702.76 ITC, -5,000 NYSERDIA, -5,925.2 nyc property  
  
Net Total: 10,998.04 - 1.09/watt  
  
**Inquiry #1 - Which of these quotes is better?**  
  
Or are these quotes both not that great? All the others I got wanted closer to $4 per watt, NYC is expensive compared to everywhere else :(

  
***Pros SunPower:*** Is microinverters and SunPower has a better warranty that includes labor. It costs 30 cents per watt more, though that drops to 21 cents more in the net.  
***Cons SunPower:*** They are only in solar business, so if they go I am out of luck. Solar market is highly competitive and will only get cheaper so if they can last the entire 25 years who knows.  
  
***Pros Hanwha:*** Panels are smaller, this ""may"" give me more flexibility in placing the panels on ideal south roof. It is also cheaper. Company does other stuff other than solar.  
***Cons Hanwha:*** But no labor warranty. Not microinverter but I hear modern string inverters are almost as good even more so with optimizers. Though warranty is smaller on the inverter.  
  
**Inquiry #2 - What is the ideal way to go about things from the tax incentive perspective and is there any gotcha I need to worry about?**  
  
***Gotcha I am aware of:*** I'd have to pay federal taxes on some of the state incentives  
  
***Is it best to go 10-11kw now? or go half that?*** The NYSERDIA incentive is capped at 5k, and you only need 20k to get it capped. Would it make sense to go 5kw now then another 5kw next year? Or are the incentives limited to 1 per house? I would lose some % on the ITC, though not sure about the property abatement and NYSUN? Anyone know the limitations of claiming these?  
  
***If I plan to redo my roof:*** Can that be included in the solar nyc property tax abatement? Fully or partly? I know ITC does not allow it anymore, but what about the NYC property tax abatement?",energy,1652164158
personalfinance,Opinions on Capital One,"Hello,

Recently moved to a new job with larger income per month and was thinking about switching banks that have slightly higher interest rates. I'm thinking Capital One is a top contender with their checking / saving interest rate.

Wanted to see if anyone in the community would be kind enough to share some experience they had with Capital One. Chase is offering me .02 percent where was Capital One is offering .5 on checking and .6 and 360 performance saving.

Do you think it's worth the hassle of switching banks? I have about 33k in the bank and get about 2.6k -&gt; 3.1k every 1/2 month. Are there better options I am skipping out on? The only downside is that Capital One does not have Branches in my area and it would be purely online and deposits through CVS.

If anyone else has good ideas where to place some of my money I am open ears!",finance,1652164315

CryptoCurrency,Shot's fired from Paxos: both USDC‘s and Tether’s tokens are “stablecoins” in anything other than name- both of their products are backed by illiquid and risky debt obligations — a critical weakness that no prudential regulator would allow to exist as this creates undue risk for all token holders,"Stablecoins seem to be the talk of the town, nice post from last year... TerraUSD shizzle applicable...

 A Regulated Stablecoin Means Having a Regulator

I have been reading with a combination of disbelief and exasperation the recent [**claims**](https://www.coindesk.com/circle-is-not-winning-stablecoin-transparancy-race) by Circle that “USDC has become the world’s most trusted and well-regulated dollar digital currency,” as well as [**claims**](https://www.coindesk.com/what-tether-means-when-it-says-its-regulated)  by  Tether that “Tether is registered and regulated.”  Neither USDC nor   Tether is a regulated digital asset, for the simple reason that  neither  token has a regulator.

USDC  and Tether are used frequently in the crypto economy and have a  useful  role to play, just as Bitcoin, Ethereum and other unregulated  digital  assets play an important role. Users who are willing to tolerate  the  risk of a token backed by only 61% cash or cash equivalents (in the   case of USDC) or 5% (in the case of Tether) should be free to take that   risk — subject of course to applicable securities laws. But these   tokens are not regulated, and **they should never be confused with a regulated token.** 

The principal value of regulatory oversight is to ensure that the *reserves consist of real, liquid, accessible dollars* — if neither USDC nor Tether can fulfill these promises, ***can they even be considered dollar-backed stablecoins?***

**REGULATED STABLECOINS**

As  of today, there are exactly three regulated dollar-backed  stablecoins  in the world: Paxos Standard (“PAX”) and Binance Dollar  (“BUSD”), both  issued by Paxos Trust Company, and the Gemini Dollar  (“GUSD”), issued  by Gemini Trust Company. Paxos and Gemini are both  Trust companies  regulated by the New York State Department of Financial  Services  (“NYDFS”). Trusts are required to have their products and  services  approved and supervised by NYDFS. [**PAX**](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr1809101), [**BUSD**](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr1909051) and [**GUSD**](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr1809101) are expressly approved by the NYDFS and supervised by the regulator on an ongoing basis. This means:

* The  value of each stablecoin token is tied directly to the value  of the US  dollar, and the amount of “reserve” dollars equal or exceed  the number  of stablecoins outstanding.
* Regulators are overseeing the establishment and maintenance of reserves backing the stablecoins.
* Reserves   may only be held in the safest forms, such as FDIC-insured bank   accounts and in short-term maturity US Treasury instruments.
* Reserves   are fully segregated from corporate assets, specifically for the   benefit of token holders, and are held bankruptcy remote pursuant to the   New York Banking Law.

Regulatory  oversight is important because it assures stablecoin users  that the  dollars underlying their stablecoins are secure and will be  immediately  available when they want them. The NYDFS ensures the Trust  companies  and their individual tokens are following its strict rules at  all  times. Additionally, NYDFS regulatory oversight meets the ten   high-level recommendations for stablecoins set forth by the Financial   Stability Board in an important [**report**](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131020-3.pdf) issued last year for the G20.

**UNREGULATED “STABLECOINS”**

“Stablecoins”  not subject to prudential regulation do not have the  same oversight  and guardrails. USDC and Tether reserves are not  comprehensively  overseen by any financial regulators. Their reserves are  broadly  unrestricted and not held bankruptcy-remote under applicable  law. This  means:

* The [**USDC**](https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/Grant-Thorton_circle_usdc_reserves_07162021.pdf) and [**Tether**](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt) reserves are backed substantially by corporate debt obligations.
* The consumer is not protected or guaranteed to get their dollars back when they redeem the token. 
* There is illiquidity risk because these investments have maturities as long as several years. 
* There is credit risk from a corporate default. 
* There is interest rate risk that can impair the value of longer maturity securities. 
* In the case of USDC, reserves are held on Circle’s [**balance sheet**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824301/000121390021036070/ea143875ex99-6_concordacq.htm), implying that Circle views USDC reserves as its own property.  
* The issuer can (and often does) use consumer funds to pursue risky high-yield investments for its own financial gain.

inflation,Plenty of blame to go around,"There is plenty of blame to go around in the inflation game.  Trump said to Biden on national TV that the story of the next presidency would be inflation.  One of trumps biggest successes was Steve Mnuchin and he seemed to make the right choices to temper inflation.  The Democrats drive to raise earnings is a big factor and obviously fuel prices is the major issue.  

With that said, it would be incredibly easy to fix the issue.  Raising interest rates is an old wives tail and adding expense to families hurt by inflation is a double whammy.  

The government has the ability to cap fuel prices at $X.  The government could pick up the adjustment and stabilize the price at the pump.  Fuel prices drive everything:  food on the shelf, travel, small business, logistics, every day travel, etc.  This one change could temper inflation more than 4 rate increases.

stocks,A bank loan for buying stocks?,"I'm trying my luck with scholarships and stuff but it's becoming ever more clear that I'm gonna have to take out a loan to compensate for what the scholarship doesn't give me, think cost of living and other expenses. But there's always the possibility that I'm just not gonna win the scholarship, and when thinking about what to do with the loan to try to make it worthwhile, of course stocks came to mind.

I know I could always just pay it back and be done with it, but I could also leverage it to make more money. Real state is not an option simply because I don't want to deal with that knowing that I don't wanna stay in my home country, so stocks seem like the better option. 

I was thinking about my classic S&amp;P/US dividend/International/REIT ETFs that I've had for a while now, and with the current market downturn it seems pretty wise, but I'm not sure of what conditions the loan should have for this to not bite me in the ass, or if it even makes any sense.

So, what do you think Reddit? Am I just a 3rd world country idealist that's gonna get burned? Or is there any merit to this approach?

EDIT: most of you have said that's a stupid idea for good reasons but some have based it in assumptions that I failed to disclose, my bad. I do have a job guys, a pretty good one as a software dev, I'm also not in college right now, the loan I mentioned is a bank loan to cover living and other expenses IF I end up getting the scholarship (it's in another country and I still don't know if I'll be allowed to keep my job), it's not a student loan. But if I don't get the scholarship, the loan is still there (took it before getting the scholarship because in my country the time it takes to approve a loan is ridiculous) so I'm thinking of ways to make money off of it instead of just returning the money. Lastly, I'll copy a comment that gets too close to what I was initially thinking about. Remember the important part: below 3% interest rate:

""-If you can get a low interest rate you should do it. Any loan you can get below 3% is something you should put in the market (esp in todays down market) and just pay back the monthly minimums (...) Most people say ""don't invest with borrowed money"" and 9 times out of 10, that advice applies because in the real world, it's very hard to get a sizable loan at such a low rate. If you're paying 8%, 10% etc. then it becomes difficult to make enough money in the market to cover the interest rate, and even if you earn 12% in the market, that's only 4% net gain... probably not worth the risk. But if you're getting a 3% rate, that same 12% market gain is now a 9% profit.... In today's market, I think you're looking at 15%+ easily by end of this year...""",finance,1652184440
stocks,Upstart and its 50% drop pre-market,"Upstart reported earnings last evening and beat for the quarter on top and bottom line however it cut its outlook for the year as they now expect the surge in interest rates to lead to lower demand for loans and therefore slowed growth.

This is really a side story. The major issue is the rise of Loans held-for-sale. From their 10-k: ""Upstart-powered loans originated by bank partners are either retained by the bank partners, purchased by the Company and immediately sold to institutional investors under loan sale agreements, or purchased and held by the Company for a period of time before being sold to third-party investors, or held to maturity by the Company for the primary purpose of product research and development. Loans retained and held on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets are classified as either held-for-investment or held-for-sale, and loans purchased for immediate resale to third-party investors are classified as held-for-sale. Immediate loan resales to institutional investors are accounted for as transfers of financial assets when the Company surrenders control of these loan assets. These sales typically occur shortly after the origination of the loans by the bank partner and the Company’s subsequent acquisition of the loans from the originating bank partner.""

Upstart has reiterated multiple times that they do not want to take on significant credit risk. They want to be the platform where loans are originated, not the bank where funds are financed. Despite this Held-for-sale loans on their balance sheet are as follows (in millions):

12/31/20 $60,232

12/31/21 $142,685

03/31/22 $372,098 ESTIMATE (142,685+443,190 purchase of HFS loans -20,328 payments – 50,765 HFS sale)

During the earning call, management indicated that as they roll out new products, they need to show the underwriting logic is pricing risk accurately. Until the new product is accepted by the banks, management may need to continue financing these loans. When asked on the earning call if the held-for-sale loans in this quarter should be seen as a high-water mark management basically said no. 

So why down 50%? Well, you have unproven software underwriting new loans that are apparently unable to be sold to the market. Since the purchase of held-for-sale loans is part of how their operations are working, this purchase is a draw on their cash produced from operations. In other words, if there were no held-for-sale transactions, Cash from operations for Q1 would have been $105 million. When you include the purchases, CFO was -267 million. Does that sound like a good thing?

On the flip side, should Upstart obtain liquidity for these loans the operations look pretty strong given their continued revenue growth. Now that they are buying these loans, cash from operations is sucked dry.

If you are betting that Upstart’s platform will price risk well, this is likely to be a short-term issue as new products mature. Having said that, this dynamic may continue in the future as new business lines are added and tested.

stocks,A harbinger of the end of the stock market catastrophe? Is the market short-term bear or bull?,"""How far are we from bottoming?"" ""Was Wednesday's U.S. CPI a positive catalyst?"" These are two of the most frequently asked questions by an institutional client today.

The latest consumer price index (CPI), the April inflation report, will be released on Wednesday. Ahead of the report, turmoil in U.S. stocks and major assets continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq tumbling 4.3 percent and the S&amp;P 500 falling more than 3.2 percent.

The recent stock market trend has been greatly disturbed by trading and sentiment factors, but if the US April CPI to be released on Wednesday can confirm the inflation turning point (that is, inflation has peaked), it will help to alleviate some of the market's selling pressure.

**First, the market generally expects the U.S. CPI to drop to 8.1% in April**

According to Dow Jones estimates, economists expect the pace of U.S. inflation to moderate in April, with the headline consumer price index (CPI) likely to rise 8.1% from a year earlier (compared to 8.5% reported in March) The CPI, which includes food and energy, will rise by 6% year-on-year (compared to 6.5% reported in March).

The year-on-year growth rate of the US CPI in April is expected to be 8.1%; the year-on-year growth rate of the CPI excluding food and energy (ie core CPI) is expected to be 6.0%. In terms of month-on-month, the month-on-month growth rate of the U.S. CPI in April is expected to be 0.2% (the value announced in March was 1.2%); the month-on-month growth rate of the CPI excluding food and energy is expected to be 0.4% (the value announced in March was 0.3%).

Wednesday's CPI will show a broader slowdown in prices in core commodity categories, as demand for durable consumer goods has begun to steadily decline due to the outbreak. This will offset still-strong inflation in the core services sector. They expect the headline CPI to hover in the 7%-8% range until September; their forecast for the fourth-quarter CPI fell to 6.3%, down from an earlier forecast of 6.8%.

**Second, how do institutions view the impact of the US April CPI report?**

The surge in oil prices caused by the situation in Russia and Ukraine was the main reason why the U.S. CPI exceeded expectations in March - energy prices contributed 0.8% month-on-month growth to the March CPI (+1.2%), and the March CPI year-on-year (+8.5%) ) contributed 2.2% growth). If this factor is deducted, the US CPI may have ushered in an inflection point in March.

The good news at present is that the month-on-month contribution of oil prices in the next month is expected to be significantly reduced, and the superimposed durable consumer goods (used cars, etc.) are expected to be included in the decline. If the month-on-month can drop to 0.2%, the year-on-year growth rate of the U.S. CPI in April may be expected to From a high of 8.5% in March to around 8% - this will at least help inflation reach an apparent inflection point.

The likely contribution of gasoline prices to the April CPI index, which is expected to be a 0.3 percentage point drag on the April CPI index, will decline.

Investors will reassess the Fed's June monetary policy outlook if April CPI data confirms that inflation may have peaked in March, FXStreet's Eren Sengezer said in a research note. And if the CPI data unexpectedly rises, the market should stick to the view that the Fed will raise interest rates by 75 basis points in June.

If inflation has peaked, then maybe market expectations for central bank (Fed) action, more aggressiveness, have peaked, and the decline in bonds and stocks could narrow further. ""It believes that this week's tough times for the market may be over.

It is also worth mentioning that before the release of the CPI report on Wednesday, Fed officials and Richmond Fed President Barkin will speak on inflation, and President Biden will also speak on inflation.",finance,1652187879

I was thinking of also applying to the Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card, which currently offers 0% intro APR for 15 months from account opening on purchases and balance transfers. (I will probably need to start borrowing money within a month or two).  I should be able to get a high credit limit on that card, and I would use it for all credit card payments for the house (eg, appliances, flooring, lighting).

AIUI, if I set it to make minimum payments only, this would give me an interest-free loan for 15 months, usable only for credit card payments.

It charges a balance transfer fee of 3% within 60 days, which is more than Interactive Brokers' interest rate, so that feature wouldn't be helpful.

stocks,Are stocks dropping because of interest rate rises? Or are stocks dropping because interest rates rises will likely lead to a recession?,"In short, the question is why are stocks dropping. Everything is tanking as we all know.

But, I think there's a big difference in stocks dropping due to interest rate rises and stocks dropping because there is a potential recession coming as a result of the interest rate rises.

In the case of the latter, I believe a recession is just part of the cycle of boom/bust and the economy will eventually turn around and return to ATH's.

In the case of the former, it scares me that interest rate level has a large impact on the fundamentals of the economy.

Warren Buffet always say interest rates are to asset prices what gravity is to matter. If rates do stay at higher levels than we've had for the last 10 years or so, then it could be a slow slow climb up from wherever the low point of this stock market fall is, or that's my fear at least.

So what's the general consensus of WHY the market is dropping so much? Change in fundamentals of companies due to interest rate rises or likely recession due to interest rate rises?",finance,1652195254

Recently I have taken on too much personal debt, and after all the consolidating I have managed, I'm left with $250 a month to spare after all expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I both work full time, and split all mutual bills down the middle. Our personal debts are our own responsibility. We both claim 1 on our tax allowances because we like the fat chunk we get from the child tax credit every year and split it. I however, probably have to sacrifice my half and get it throughout the year instead of getting it in a lump sum in order for me to be able to pay my debts down and actually save money again.

So here is my question. If I were to adjust my W4(?) to claim more allowances, could we still get the tax credit in a lump sum at half?

Small investors continue to pour money into stocks despite the grimmest outlook in years for interest rates and a possible recession; ‘When the market zigs, I zag’

This year’s stock market volatility has turbocharged a favorite strategy among individual investors: buying the dip. The dramatic plunge in major indexes will test their resolve.

On Thursday, when the stock market had one of its worst days of the year, individuals rushed in, setting a one-day buying record. In March, they invested the largest ever monthly sum, according to Vanda Research data beginning in 2014, and continued to pour money into the markets in April.

Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&amp;P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This year, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 16%, its worst start to a year in nearly a century, and the Nasdaq Composite has dropped 26%. Inflation is at a 40-year high, and the Federal Reserve has embarked on an aggressive monetary tightening cycle, enacting this month its biggest rate increase since 2000. That has fanned worries about a recession—periods when stocks have on average fallen as much as 29%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Some of the wildly popular trades of the past two years have already crumbled. Many investors have soured on richly valued technology stocks. Newly minted public companies, which soared last year, have come back down to earth. Highly speculative corners of the market, such as Cathie Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund, have plummeted.

Despite the turning tides, many individual investors said they have relished the chance to buy stocks at a discount. Many said the calculation is simple: History has shown that stocks eventually go up.

Small investors plowed $114 billion into U.S. stock funds through March as the S&amp;P 500 tumbled into a correction, falling at least 10% from its high, according to Goldman Sachs Group. That marks a sharp shift in the group’s strategy for much of the past two decades. Typically, individual investors have sold about $10 billion in the 12 weeks after a market peak when the S&amp;P 500 has tumbled that much.

In the month of March alone, individual investors bought about $28 billion of U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds on a net basis—the total amount after subtracting the amount sold—the largest monthly sum on record, according to Vanda, and another net $24.4 billion in April. On Thursday, when the S&amp;P 500 tumbled 3.6%, individual investors bought a net total of nearly $2.6 billion of stocks and ETFs, a one day record, according to Vanda.

John Case, a 71-year-old retired engineer in Las Vegas, said he has tried to follow famed investor Warren Buffett’s advice to be “greedy only when others are fearful” and to hold stocks for long periods of time.

He said he has often stepped into the market during times of volatility and learned this lesson the hard way when he sold some of his shares during the 2008 financial crisis. That plunge was followed by an 11-year bull market during which the S&amp;P 500 surged roughly 400%. Now, he said he is more confident in his strategy.

“When the market zigs, I zag,” Mr. Case said.

Unlike the crash of early 2020, which lasted just 23 trading days, investors are weathering a more prolonged selloff that could worsen as recession risks grow. The Fed’s move to raise rates and shrink its $9 trillion asset portfolio has already triggered a selloff in the government-bond market, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumping past 3% to its highest level since 2018. Higher yields typically chip away at the stock market’s allure by giving investors another attractive place to park their cash.

Individual investors’ appetite for stocks diverges from the behavior of professional investors, who have collectively sold stocks during the turbulence. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. estimates that institutional investors have pulled $199 billion out of the stock market this year, according to an analysis of public order flow data through Friday. Meanwhile, pros keep ramping up bearish bets against major U.S. equity indexes through the futures market, analysis from Citi Research shows.

That hasn’t stopped many individual investors from wading in. Their allocation of stocks in their portfolios crept up to nearly 70% last month, hovering around the highest levels since early 2018, according to a survey by the American Association of Individual Investors. Many individual investors whittled their exposure to bonds, sending fixed-income allocations to a 14-year low.

The strategy of picking up stocks and other investments on sale has grown so popular that the term “buy the dip” has mushroomed into an online sensation, garnering millions of mentions on social-media platforms. The growing entanglement of investing and social media means that even sharp plunges can bring on calls of FOMO—fear of missing out.

In January, when stocks suffered their worst month since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, and prices of assets including stocks, bonds and bitcoin slid, many investors turned to platforms such as Twitter and Reddit to tout the strategy, leading to more than 200,000 mentions across social media, according to social-media management company Hootsuite. That’s more than 30 times the figure three years ago.

Some strategists say buying the dip is a risky way to invest because it is so difficult to gauge whether the market is going to keep falling. Vanda estimates the average individual investor portfolio peaked late last year and has since tumbled, giving the average individual a paper loss of about 28%.

Online brokerages including Robinhood Markets Inc. have reported a slowdown in customer trading activity in recent weeks.

Chief Executive Vlad Tenev said on the firm’s April earnings call that it faced a “challenging macro environment, one most of our customers have never experienced in their lifetimes,” noting that for most of its history, “Robinhood has operated in a period of low interest rates, low inflation and rising markets.” He said that while larger customers are still remaining active, many other customers have become more cautious with their portfolios and are trading less frequently.

CryptoCurrency,"The 2013 theory. Don't be surprised if everything you were told about this crash turns out to be wrong. Many of the theories thrown around, overlooked a lot of important data. I'll use 2013 as an example, showing there are more scenarios at play that could catch the market by surprise.","First off, this post is not about claiming that we're gonna follow the 2013 pattern, or that the same thing is necessarily happening.

We could end up like in 2018.

The point is there are many scenarios at play.

&amp;#x200B;

# 1- You have to be prepared for every scenario, because no one knows what will happen next.

Don't bet everything on one narrative.

Remember last year year when people predicted we would hit $100K? But then we crashed from $68K.

Remember last September when people said Evergrande would plunge us into 2008 2.0? But then when it finally defaulted, we had a ""Santa rally"" in the stock market reaching new highs.

We now have people literally making posts saying we are 100% going into a crypto winter and long recession, and neither crypto nor stocks are gonna be able to bounce back.

While prices have been battered in crypto, and it looks like we could be entering a crypto winter, believe it or not it's not the only scenario still at hand.

It wouldn't be the first time crypto got battered this hard, then bounced back into a rally instead of plunging into a recession. In fact, we have some very good historical precedent for other scenarios.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2- But what about stocks? Aren't we just gonna follow stocks if they go down?

Crypto's correlation to stock is there, but it has been overblown a little.

In fact, if you look at the data, we've never actually hit a strong statistical correlation (0.8 or above).  We've only been at moderate correlation at around 0.5, going only as high as around 0.65.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin correlation to the S&amp;P 500](https://preview.redd.it/lbcl0bo1eoy81.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=009a2e71c577f7cdd2b19fe81e1f9d19cbdc7453)

Keep in mind, this moderate correlation started with Covid, and since the Fed started printing extra liquidity. That's what fueled that correlation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6q8s5z8jeoy81.jpg?width=820&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2549f7ed6522781b0a92fee977bea43634508e9

Now that the Fed switched off the printers, the fuel for that correlation is no longer there. We are left with maybe some lingering psychological fuel.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3-So what happened in 2013?

In 2013 we had a bull cycle, after a long bear winter.

From February 2013 until April, Bitcoin went on an incredible parabolic bull run. Going from $20 to almost $200.

Then it crashed.

&amp;#x200B;

[Chart 1: 2013 FOMO run](https://preview.redd.it/8wf8j01oeoy81.jpg?width=1262&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47ade9a1df6d7167f372a5fb2fd9c8cec7ea6b3f)

&amp;#x200B;

Was it the beginning of a bear winter cycle?

It seemed like it, and went on for a few months.

We had many people claiming that the bear winter was here, and to expect a long recession.

But that mini bear cycle got cut short, and barely lasted half a year.

In October 2013, the bull run that started at the beginning of the year resumed. And the price went parabolic again, reaching its true peak at  over $1K.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Chart 2: full 2013 cycle, with mini bear market in between. ](https://preview.redd.it/vsqh2wcseoy81.jpg?width=1262&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5832dad166b792047f36f8e5d83d22ee079e0a1)

&amp;#x200B;

This shows a precedent for having a mini bear market in the middle of a bull cycle. Especially when the market has a hard time at finding new lows.

Since the two big crashes we had, the market has spent months trying to find a new low below $28K.

# 

# 4- What could cause a mini bear market or a break within a bull market?

Maybe lot of bad economic news at once? That could cause a bull cycle to have a break in between.

The break of war with Russia, and fears of WW3. Stock markets correcting. High inflation. Still some after effects of a pandemic. Fed rates increasing and spooking markets.

I think a combo like that should be enough downward pressure, to pause a bull cycle.

In fact, if we were in a bear market, a combo like that would have cratered the crypto market by now.

When crypto is in a bear market, it takes very little bad news to drop.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5- The patterns.

What about other historic ratios and patterns? Aren't we still following more of a 2017/18 pattern?

I'll let you be the judge of that:

&amp;#x200B;

[2017\/18 market](https://preview.redd.it/6cr2imdffoy81.jpg?width=1222&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f918c88ab0d3d4b2dc2373e290eef9488b20320c)

&amp;#x200B;

[Current market](https://preview.redd.it/m17wssugfoy81.jpg?width=1275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49bd308d5953b78d74412ad04520419b892c172e)

Additional ratios:

Additionally, if we start looking for patterns, the ratios just aren't matching up that much.

It would be too short to fit the pattern of time.

And it would be too low to fit the pattern of price.

$69K doesn't fit any of the historic ratios.

Here's one example:

At the end of 2017, Bitcoin peaked at $19.5k

That would be 17x  the previous bull market ATH of 2014.

In 2014, the peak was at around $1,150K. Which was about 35x the previous ATH.

If this cycle's peak was $69K, then that would only be 3.5X, breaking the pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

Maybe there isn't a pattern after all.

But if there is one, a bear market here means we have stopped following most of them.

If we are still following them, it may just mean that all these macro economic troubles have created a break in the cycle, and mini bear market break like in 2013.

That would put us on course to follow the usual halving and cycle patterns with a small break.

Either way, nothing is for sure. Which is the point I was trying to show.

You have to consider every scenarios.

There's isn't a 100% guarantee, especially in a volatile market that's still in its infancy.

Especially with so many different dynamics at play in the world. Some bullish, some bearish.

The good news is we'll know soon enough.

This is not in the US. 

I own an ambulance as a personal car, someone wants to purchase it for their paramedic company but they can't pay all the money up front and would like to make a downpayment plus monthly installments plus interests from ambulance trips they would provide. 
This would be with the eventual goal of paying me in less than a year. There are concerns: I don't have that kind of time plus it's the only vehicle I own, depreciation of vehicle, and they would have to invest in it as well to make it suitable additionally theft/damage/responsibilities being under my name. But he has assured me all that would be written in contract so I'm not liable the company would take full responsibility.

So for the sake of numbers:  I'm asking 150k not USD, thinking of asking for a 1/3 in  downpayment or 50k, plus monthly installments of 10k plus interests. Not sure how much interest I should ask for that would be fair.  They would also consider letting me borrow a rented car under their company but it was just mentioned in passing. Everything would be written in a contract with lawyer present.

So it's partially my fault as I'm pretty new to this, but also I made it very clear with the person helping me with the financial aspect of buying a house (not my realtor, the other people) that I wouldn't be comfortable paying more than x amount a month total. Like, completely. I know buying is different than renting. They wouldn't know how much utilities are, and know I would need home owners insurance, but they have estimsted taxes and stuff, so...

Well, after stressing my limit, I thought their estimation for the house I'm buying also included estimated utilities and insurance. Obviously I have to set up that stuff myself, but yknow.

I was going over the paper work, the monthly is at the top of my limit. Doable, but I don't like it.

Come to see that that's just for the house. They did not estimate it with utilities and insurance after I stressed how much this is my limit for paying a month.

I kinda don't know what to do. I love this house. I might be able to push the monthly payment down if I accept my parents' help (money gift) for the down payment but that is a complicated subject for me. Then I noticed the interest rate is 7%, when my loan isn't even FHA. Dunno why it's that high so I'll ask about that before I agree to it.

I feel like maybe I should walk away but with this market I also feel like I won't get a better chance than this. It's not perfect but it's very me and it's a good spot for where I work. I dunno. Don't want to make a horrible mistake but feeling very stressed.

She ended up dropping her wallet somewhere and because we were at an open bar wedding she did not notice until the next day. The thief had her entire wallet with her ID. So I am assuming thief tried her birthyear as the PIN.  So the thief went to 10+ ATMs and took out $200 each time. This resulted in her having a negative balance over $1,600. Not sure how the bank allowed those transactions to go through.

She called the bank first thing in the morning to report the charges and lock her card. The representative on the phone seemed to be sure the bank would reimburse her and she had nothing to worry about. She goes into a local branch back home yesterday and the person that helped her was suspicious of fraud on her part. She was told they will take 10 days to credit her account back for the fraudulent charges. They still can take all the money back after 45 days if they find it was not fraud.

Now today the bank took money from her savings to cover the negative balance in the checking. The bank employee she talked to never said this would happen and now she has basically $0 to her name.

How can a bank do that when there is an open fraud investigation underway? I have no idea what to do I am living paycheck to paycheck myself. So do we have any kind of recourse here or are we just at the mercy of what the bank decided to do?

TL;DR: Wife had a thief go to 10+ ATMs after losing her wallet. Now bank used her savings account to cover those charges and she has no money left.

So I am a college student who has a decent chunk of change that I know is losing quite a bit of value to current inflation. The government site that issues bonds (treasurydirect) is issuing 9.62% interest rate bonds and I want to buy the maximum ($10,000). What risks are there to doing this?

vet,"Need advice for high-maintenance, but amazing cat.","Hi all,

I am hoping the wonderful professionals and pet owners of this subreddit can help me find solutions to a few current issues withy pet. 

I have a 12-year-old cat named Smoky who is the absolute best, but has had a slew of health issues over the past few years. I was very happy with my vet after they were the first to correctly identify and help me manage her hyperthyroidism. 

But lately, I get the sense that the vet and the office consider me a nuisance. I am extremely connected to Smoky so her health is a priority to me. I firmly advocate for her health and have not been afraid to be respectful but outspoken when the clinic has fallen short at times to be sure she gets what she needs. 

I was recently diagnosed with a meningioma and will be having brain surgery soon to remove it, meaning I’m going to likely rely on friends and family to help care for my cats while I recover (I live alone so I may have to stay with family for the duration). 

My first action after the diagnosis  was to get Smoky in for a complete senior-cat check up to be sure we’re managing her hyperthyroidism well and to check out a lump on her chest and deal with a recent urinary issue. 

Because I may not be the one personally caring for Smoky for a while, I want to be able to clearly convey what she needs to be healthy to whoever is. Ideally, I’d like to get her nursed to a bit better health before they saw my skull open. 

Unfortunately, the solutions my vet is offering are falling short and he hasn’t been much help. (He’s a busy guy, I kinda get it). So I’d like to enlist your help, particularly if you’re a professional. I’ll state her issues here:

Smoky’s biggest issue the last few years has been hyperthyroidism. We manage it with Methamizol and it’s gone well.

Smoky’s kidneys aren’t what they used to be, but I’ve been told it’s not a dire situation. 

Smoky is prone to bouts of pancreatitis, but this is largely tied to her hyperthyroidism and is decently under control. 

Smoky is anemic. We just found this out and I wasn’t given much of an explanation as to what the underlying issue is. She’s being treated with a powder mixed into her food. 

Smoky has on multiple occasions shown a potassium deficiency which is treated by a supplement powder mixed into her food. 

Smoky has, in the past, had an issue of crystals in her urine. This is being treated with Flo Cat powder mixed into her food. For about a week she has been making frequent trips to the litter box to urinate with only a small amount coming out. She has also peed a number of times where she’s not supposed to outside of the litter box. Her condition has improved slightly over time, but persists. 

Smokey has a small mass on her chest near where a previous cancerous mass had grown. The plan is to remove it, but it might need to wait until I’m back to 100%. 

So those are the issues. If you’re still with me, you rock. It’s long winded, but I want to be thorough in my pursuit of solutions. 

A primary concern is making sure Smoky’s necessary meds are deliverable by someone cat-sitting who won’t be around enough to accurately observe her health. 

Her Methamizol is super easy, but as you can tell, the bulk of her supplements go on her food which presents a problem even for me who is around regularly. 

Smoky is a picky eater and had 
to be moved to an easily digestible food. It’s been recommended before that I should switch her to wet food, but there’s only one kind I’ve discovered she’ll both eat and is nutritionally sufficient. It was debilitatingly expensive and I had to then feed it to both of my cats because scheduled feeding wasn’t working (Smoky will only eat a small portion at a time which gets snarfed up by Colly, my two-year-old cat who I ironically got because the vet said Smoky needed a companion to help her deal with some stress issues).

So, I stopped the wet food and went back to free-feeding the both them Iams Proactive sensitive digestion. They each get a bowl, but they’ll eat out of either one throughout the day. Both bowls feature a full complement of Smoky’s supplements and I’ve been assured it won’t harm Colly.

I’ve become concerned, however, that Smoky is not getting enough of the supplements to have an effect on her urinary problem because she never has been a big eater. 

I’ve been trying to fight this by secluding Colly and feeding her wet food twice a day  with all the supplements mixed in, but she only ever licks all the gravy off and walks away, leaving Colly to snatch up the rest once I inevitably have to let him out of the proverbial lock-up when I leave for work. 

And so I’m still looking for a solution. My vet did mention that instead of the powdered anemia supplement, I could give her a dose of a liquid pediatric multivitamin. I’d like verification of this if possible.

I’m also curious if any vets out there could recommend to me an alternative supplement or treatment for Smoky’s urinary issue as it’s paramount I get it solved before I go under the knife and she potentially has to go largely unsupervised for a length of time. 

My vet has indicated the powder is all he can do for her and frustratingly suggested I expand the entrance to her litter boxes (there are three in the apartment) because she’s getting old. It’s a fine suggestion, but she’s getting in and out just fine, she’s just making trips far too often and judging by her licking of her genitals I’d say it’s bothering her. 

I am welcoming any and all creative solutions to hopefully get her feeling her best before I have to go under the knife and I will certainly arrange for her to have the mass removed as soon as possible, even if I have to have someone step in to do so on my behalf. 

Smoky is a wonderful cat - the very definition of what a pet should be, and I want to be sure I’m doing whatever I can to be a responsible and loving owner. Thank you for any help or suggestions you can offer.",cryptocurrency,1652215256

personalfinance,UPDATE: I believe my company is mismanaging my 401k,"UPDATE: I believe my employer is stealing from my 401k

Original post


So, about two weeks ago, I went under contract on a house. I planned to take a loan out against my 401k, to cover some closing costs. I applied for the loan and it said it was approved, on the John Hancock website. It said it was to be deposited next paycheck, 4/29/22. The money was not deposited. When I called JH to find out why I was told that my plan administrator never approved it. I went to her , (the daughter of the ceo of my small company), and was told she had not been contacted by them, and even wagged her finger at me. When I called JH back, they said , the trustee (her dad) never authorized her to approve it. They have since approved the loan, and it will be deposited tomorrow. I decided to look through my 401k transactions and noticed that the contributions are both highly variable, per check, and often are not taken out in a timely manner. There are contributions from January and February of this year that have yet to enter my account. I suppose I don’t have any direct evidence that they are stealing, but it all raises many red flags. Thoughts?
In addition, the 401k person said that there is not enough cash in the main 401k account to cover all the missing contributions. I guess I don’t understand where the missing money is.
 I sent my dad, a cpa, all my 401k statements and pay stubs for the past year. He thinks they are both skimming from 401ks to pay expenses and failing to pay federal withholding . So yeah
I made this excel sheet showing how many missing contributions there are, and how long it takes to make each deposit. Out of the past 35 paychecks, 13 have had their 401k contributions deducted but it has not been deposited in my 401k. I also know its happening to at least 2 other employees but they don’t seem concerned. The time it takes to deposit the 401k contributions ranges in time from 12-119 days. In the first quarter of this year, only two checks had their 401k contributions deposited. Also I’m in USA. Oh also, they lowered their match without telling me. My pay never changes. And I dont get tips or anything.”

Update: I have contacted the DOL EBSA division and had an agent call me today. She requested more documents from me, pay stubs, which I sent. She said she would call my plan manager and trustee, and ask about the missing contributions and go from there.  I am under the impression that I have whistleblower protection now, is this correct? I am a “right to work” state. In addition, I basically told the agent “I think they are using the contributjons to pay bills”. And that “My company had an accountant and finance controller when I started here, they are gone now and the dad and daughter handle all the finances”. So I guess they will be audited now or something?",finance,1652216938

stocks,"SOFI down bad after earnings, but is the 80% crash a huge overreaction?","SOFI fell 12% today after a leaked earnings report which showed slightly better-than-expected top and bottom lines, but slightly worse-than-expected guidance. It's now down 79% from its ATH and is trading at a 1.35 price/book ratio - meaning that for every share you own, you almost own the equivalent value in assets as opposed to only betting on projected future cash flows. That's not unusual for a big bank's stock, as loan assets only generate a few cents on the dollar. For reference, JPM is currently trading at 1.41 P/B, and TD bank is trading at 1.73. There's a huge disconnect here, as SOFI is a young, high-growth company which could justify much higher multiples. 

Many of the concerns related to student loans are, IMO, just ""seeing ghosts"" - Biden's plan for student loan forgiveness would not take away any existing loans from SOFI, as they have been refinanced as private loans, and the gov can only forgive federal loans. While this *could* decrease TAM for SOFI, it also allows more breathing room for people with &gt;10k in student debt, reducing their risk of default and making them more attractive customers for SOFI. Furthermore, while the student loan moratorium has stunted SOFI's growth in taking on new loans, this will not last forever, and we can expect SOFI's already high revenue growth rate to explode. 

I'm quite bullish on SOFI during this crash, so I'm wondering about your opinions on the bear case, or just your thoughts in general. It's been quite quiet regarding this stock lately.",finance,1652223680
personalfinance,iSeries bonds vs Money Market,"So, I stumbled across the current rate of the iSeries savings bonds today.  **9.62%**

Let's say, I was a bit surprised that it was so high, even with the inflation rates being where they are.  

Some stipulations:  

* Max investment is $10k per SSN per year.  
* Bonds must be held at least 1 year
* If redeemed &lt; 5 years, you lose 3 months interest
* Interest subject to federal taxes, but not state taxes (when redeemed)
* Interest rate is modified every 6 months and is tied to a base rate (0%) + inflation.

Our portfolio is already heavy on equities and I plan to continue investing in the market.  However, I'm looking at I Bonds as an alternative to keeping extra cash in the money market funds (earning &lt; 1%).

Besides an emergency fund, holding cash in the bank is basically losing money. Even though the base rate on the current bonds is 0%, I don't see inflation dropping below my money market rate any time soon.  (There is a risk of deflation/going negative, but I feel that is a very low risk).

Bitcoin,The Latest Development of Post-Quantum Cryptography Transition Policy Technology in America,"1. Background: Quantum computing technology will subvert the traditional cryptography, which will constitute a comprehensive national security threat (government agencies+critical infrastructure+industry). With the rise of post-quantum cryptography, the information systems of the U.S. government and industry are migrating to post-quantum cryptography. 2. Quantum Computing Network Security Readiness Act: Start the post-quantum cryptography transition within one year, conduct information technology system evaluation, determine the information system with priority transition, and issue a risk assessment strategy. Response to threat funds, international standards cooperation framework, etc. 3. Status and progress of post-quantum cryptography in the United States (2015-2022)2022 Biden included ""anti-quantum cryptography"" in the national security memorandum 4. Evaluation: This bill is aimed at the security risks of quantum computing, and aims to protect the US federal information system. American quantum technology companies all expressed their support. The localization process of anti-quantum cryptography algorithm (planning+timeline) will become an important guarantee of information security ecology. China expects to realize the commercial application of anti-quantum cryptography algorithm around 2025.


The development of quantum computing will not only bring opportunities, but also potential risks, especially the possibility of breaking the existing public key cryptography algorithms. The Quantum Computing Network Security Readiness Act proposed by the United States aims to protect the federal information system from the potential threats of quantum computing. American quantum technology companies including IBM, Google, QuSecure, Maybell Quantum and Quantinuum all support the Act. Since the National Quantum Initiative Act was issued in 2018, the United States has taken a series of measures to strengthen investment in personnel training and R&amp;D, aiming at maintaining the global leadership position of the United States in quantum information science. Biden's government budgeted $187 million for NIST in fiscal year 2023, which was used to update the standards of emerging technologies, including quantum science.

CryptoCurrency,The mother of all crashes and an even bigger bailout is coming.,"Basis: The credit based economy created by the central banks where the foundational layer of money has no collateral is unsustainable.

Let me start from the 2020 to 2022 scenario. Covid pandemic happened. Lockdown was initiated worldwide. Productivity halted. Stocks, commodities, crypto crashed.  It seemed like the beginning of the end. 

Then comes the bailouts, the money printer went brrrr...

Not physically, ""digitally"". (His own words)

JPow literally had to press 'ENTER' on his keyboard to print more than 40% of the entire USD in history. Not to mention, they lowered interest rates to almost zero.

I'm not against the bailouts of those in need. Mind you, they needed it. But remember that they used the bailouts of the poor as an excuse to bailout the markets. The stimulus checks accounted for only a fraction of the entire bailouts that happened.

Then you saw what happened, everything went up. Stocks, crypto and what not. Everyone was happy, people were rich... On paper. 

But all of these had a major side effect: INFLATION.

When you consider money as a commodity and everyone has more of it, the real tangible commodities like food, etc (whose production had been slowed by lockdowns) will obviously become expensive. Basic economics.

That's why we had the largest inflation hike in history recently.



#So, where am I getting with this?

Now that everyone with a brain cell realises that printing money to avoid short term pain has long term consequences. 

The fed decides to play God again. Cranking the lever up and crashing everyone's party. Consecutive rate hikes and it's fear has driven the market to capitulate again. 

The rate hikes combined with a War has created uncertainty by exacerbating the problem. This could last for a while. 

The fed is desperately trying to 'Control' inflation, when they're the ones who created the problem in the first place. 

#What could be next?

The recent inflation fears and the crash of the markets has created a scenario of political suicide for the ruling government. And I'm willing to bet that they'll abuse using the short term pain reliever again. (aka they will bailout the markets again) If they want to stay in power.
Also midterm elections are coming.

The same root cause of the problem that creates market bubbles will happen again. Because mind you, we're all stuck in that same loop over and over, the moment the Bretton Woods was signed.

#Now regarding crypto and specially Bitcoin.

Bitcoin was supposed to be independent of this bullshit. However, the venture capital that has flowed into it recently is tied to the traditional markets. 

The rich folks in Bitcoin still consider it as a trading tool like stocks. That's why we still follow the price action of stock markets.

However, true believers of the Bitcoin thesis proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto would see that Bitcoin is a parallel economic system to the traditional markets.

CryptoCurrency,What's actually going on - a non emotional take,"If you read a lot of the posts right now you will see a lot of takes. Crypto is doomed! Crypto is fine! 

What you won't see a lot of, is information or facts. You will see emotion or people saying ""I was around in the previous crash...""

So heres a little about whats actually going on. 


This shouldn't necessarily be looked at as a crash, so much as 60k was a huge bubble. It was caused by basically all non tech investments going to shit during the pandemic (and because of structural issues still lingering post 2008). 

Money needs to work. That's the rule of the rich. It has to be earning. Money thus flows like water trying to find the path of least resistance, but instead looking for the path of greatest returns with lowest risk. 

As interest rates rise we are seeing the last places you could invest start to falter. 

So we are now seeing whats called ""capital preservation"" - no investments or assets can return good enough gains with low enough risk. So the rich are pulling money out of everything to sit on it. (Actually, they have largely already rotated to energy stocks in 2021, this has been coming for a long time). They will eat the inflation (as inflation is a measure of yearly loss of cash value 8% loss in a year? Pretty incredible compared to everything else)

The next year or so will be a little rough but, you just have to ask yourself a few questions - when they start spending cash again, will they return to crypto? 

Of course they will! They are sitting on cash to preserve its value, then when we hit the bottom they will be back. 

My advice is to wait. I'd maybe consider pausing DCA, its hard to believe we are at the bottom when more interest rates are coming. 

Its why everyone told you not to go all in, to not use leverage and not to invest what you cant afford to lose. 

You dont need to be a genius! You dont need to even understand it all. You dont need to believe me.  You just need to know what the billionaires are doing and try and copy as much as possible. 

Me personally ima hedge a little into energy stocks (buy natural gas right now.) And then preserve cash until recovery.",cryptocurrency,1652254268

personalfinance,"Long term investment as a college student, am I missing something?","I’m (19 in CA) currently attending community college as a freshman while working part time making a good wage (30/hr), and I’ve saved up a little over 23K in liquidity, and about 5k in a car I expect to sell when I move and transfer to a uni for engineering after next year. 

Up until now, my strategy has been to try and never go into student debt, because I’ve been scared shitless of it. So much so that I figured I never actually needed to check and do the math for a future where I do take out loans. 

Turns out, undergrad federal student loans are fixed under 4% for up to 12500 a year! 

I do not expect to be pulling anything over this amount.

Over ten years, it’s relatively safe to say the market will grow more than 4 YOY, so why shouldn’t I just max out a Roth IRA and open a taxable brokerage account with target date funds? 

Of course I’ll still have an emergency fund, but I truly don’t see any good reason to keep getting eaten alive by inflation in my savings account, when this debt is so cheap? 

The advice section of this sub says to avoid student debt at all costs, but as long as I’m not taking private loans, it seems like a no brainer to intentionally go into student debt. 

Am I missing something?",finance,1652255467
investing,I just leveraged my 401k and thought I'd share the details,"&gt;**Edit:** y'all are missing the point. I didn't post this to talk about the viability or lack thereof my trading ability.  
&gt;  
&gt;**My point is that wealth is built with debt, full stop.** Whether it's building a business, buying a rental property, a franchise, or equity in an already existing one, the wealthiest people in the world purchase their cash flow assets with other peoples' money. However, before you're wealthy, access to that good debt can be hard to get, and **I wanted to share one avenue that most people have that they might not realize.**

I'm a profitable trader. However, the biggest obstacle to me growing my account has just been lack of capital(I started with my stimmy check and have slowly ground that upwards), and having PDT restrictions. I've been on the hunt lately for a way to expedite things via leverage or margin, but personal loan interest rates are garbage and I don't have home equity to take a line of credit out on. I recently stumbled upon 401k loans(NOT hardship loans) being a thing, and I thought I'd share with everyone how pretty freaking amazing they are(idk how much they differ from 401k to 401k, so please DYOR)

* There's a flat processing fee, mine was $125.
* You can withdraw a minimum of $500 and a maximum of $50k or half your current account balance, whichever is less.
* You choose the repayment period, between 2 weeks and 60 months
* My interest rate was 5.5%, BUT any and all interest you pay goes right back into your 401k account, so I don't really see any downside there.
* Payments are done through your payroll company and are deducted straight from your paycheck. However, if you leave your current employment for any reason, voluntary or otherwise, you're technically on the hook for the rest of the loan amount, otherwise you'll have to take it as a taxable distribution at 10%(don't quote me on that figure).

The only two downsides I saw were shackling myself to my current employment for a couple years(which in all honesty is probably where I'll be anyways) and the necessity to use this money in a way that outperforms the market, which I've done fairly consistently.

Obviously, as with all debt, it can be bad or good depending on how you use it. I was just surprised that I and a bunch of my other friends didn't know this was an option, so I thought I'd share.

CryptoCurrency,Fallout from the algo-stablecoin apocalypse. Some points:,"The present situation is a turning point in crypto markets history. Many have lost a lot of funds and this is sure to attract a lot of heat towards crypto. Its comparable to Bitconnect bust, but the key difference is that Bitconnect didnt peddle itself as a stablecoin asking people to park their savings there. 

1 - Luna shitshow is over. Price may hobble up and down but the schadenfreude can only last so long, pretty soon it will all die down. The magnitude of losses is not even clear right now. People buying these dips are just degenerate gambling, this is not ""investing"".


2 - A whole lot of dapps/websites/mobile apps collected user funds in USDC/ USDT, even via credit cards and funelled those into Anchor UST to gain interest, and then pay out users. Orion Money, Pillow Fund, GRO, Alice, StableGains etc.. these are all apps that promised to pay users 15% based on Anchor returns. All of them are under water, and higly likely they are all insolvent. The true extent of the damage remains to be assessed. It will get even worse if we find out Celsius, Nexo etc used UST for a tranche of their funds. 


3 - A lot of reports/articles will come out on how crypto as a whole is unsustainable. They will try to claim all crypto projects are the same and will implode. This however couldnt be further from the truth. Even in stablecoins, some projects like Maker DAO have been running silently for years based on sound practices that have stood the test of time. The DAI stablecoin is always over collateralised to a great extent, just to prevent these kind of runs. Unfortunately in the bull run, loud noise was appreciated more than a silent system that just does what its supposed to do. People like Do Kwon were turned into heroes, while those building DAI silently got little to no attention. Expect the tide to completely shift now that unsustainable ponzis will no longer be in vogue. 

4 - Regulatory scrutiny will increase and accelerate. Most cryptos will be booboo stuff for a long time (months maybe even a year or so). 

5 - High APY in stablecoins is just not sustainable. So many people went from Crypto.com to Anchor after CDC slashed their interest rates. In retrospect, they went out of the frying pan straight into the fire. There is an important lesson here. Higher rates are always a result of higher risk, and your entire capital is can be lost in a matter of days. 

6 - Biggest winner of this shitshow is Ethereum and projects on Ethereum. [Example](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/maker). L2 scaling is already live, developing fast and most of sustainable defi is being built on Ethereum+L2s, and going to scale for millions of users with very low fees in the next couple of years. What exists on other chains is just copycat projects and forks of existing Ethereum projects that the market will soon realize is a poor copycat product because of both lack of network security + availability of a better option on L2s.",cryptocurrency,1652261679
Forex,Will inflation data help AUD/USD bounce?,"Weak Chinese trade data saw AUD/USD break critical support at 0.7000 earlier this week, but the pair is currently trading over 1% and looks on track to reclaim this important level as the US Dollar pulls back ahead of today’s CPI figures.

The greenback’s strength has been the root of a lot of the recent FX volatility, however if today’s print match expectations and signal a potential peak in inflation, we could see AUD/USD rebound on improved economic sentiment, and a weaker USD as speculation on a 75bps Fed hike eases.

CryptoCurrency,CargoX NFTs as a bill of lading,"So now that the market is crashing, the subreddit is ready to hear about actual use cases. So here I will present one to you: CargoX (CXO).

**What do they do?**

Their main product is electronic bill of lading. Bill of landings traditionally have to be printed and then sent by UPS, DHL, FedEx,... to the customer. This process takes a lot of time and is time consuming. This is where CargoX steps in and creates an NFT on the Polygon network. Then users can send the documents to the customers instantly. 

CargoX is right now being used as a mandatory way for imports by sea in Egypt. It has been in use since October 1st. Since then it has reduced the average cost from 600$ to 165$ and cust the time from 29 days to 9 days. On October 1st the use of the system will also have to be mandatory for air freight.

Besides bills of lading they also support 65 other types of documents. In short if the document is important and it is expensive to move/create it today, then they can help.

**Token economics**

For each document that is created the team buys back .6$ of the tokens from the market. They are working on creating a relayer system where .3$ will be paid to the relayer and .3$ will be burned. Long term they will create a side chain, that will use CXO as gas.

stocks,U.S. CPI beats expectations in April! U.S. stock futures plunge,"Recently, the global capital market has been falling, and the Nasdaq index of the US stock market continued to hit a new low since the fall yesterday.

The three major U.S. stock indexes, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&amp;P, will fall by 30% or more from their highs, and now Nasdaq is fast. And Goldman Sachs recently released a report that the S&amp;P index fell by 28%!

This round of stock market slump, the macro reasons, of course, is the Fed's interest rate hike. After experiencing the most violent water release cycle in history, the Federal Reserve has also ushered in the most violent interest rate hike cycle in history. It feels like it is witnessing history every year. At present, the market expects that interest rates will continue to be raised at every Fed meeting this year.

The rate hikes have severely pushed up U.S. Treasury yields, the anchor for global interest rates. At present, the yield of the 10-year US Treasury bond has exceeded 3%, and the yield of long-term and short-term Treasury bonds has also inverted. From experience, this is not only bad for the financial market, but also often a precursor to a recession in the real economy.

In addition, the bubble of the US stock market itself is also one of the internal reasons. If the US stock market adopts the valuation system of Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller, it is currently the second largest in history. At its high point, it was extremely close to the peak of the 2000 Internet bubble.

From an industrial point of view, this round of decline is something that has never been encountered since the financial crisis in 2008, and that is the failure of technology giants. The five FAANG giants, which were once all-powerful, changed their name to META on Facebook, and gambled heavily on Yuan Universe, their profits almost halved, and the stock price fell by 48%. Amazon's e-commerce business posted a loss, falling 42%. The results of Google and Netflix also fell short of expectations by 25% and 75%, respectively.

At present, almost only Apple is still the only one. In the past, technology was the biggest driving force for the rise of US stocks. The top five technology companies alone contributed more than 30% of the index's rise. Now, the performance has peaked, and some large technology companies have even been cut in half, which can be called a double kill for Davis.

Even so, the ceiling is about to appear, and Apple's revenue growth in the first quarter has dropped to single digits, only 9%. This growth rate is difficult to support a price-earnings ratio of 30 times in A shares, let alone in US stocks. The crash of tech stocks

dogecoin,Why the drop? Here's a theory...,"The UST stable coin is secured by BTC and Luna.

Earlier this year BTC shot up in value when the Luna team bought up expensive BTC to secure UST... 

At the time, it appears that some giant BTC whale or group of whales sold into the rise -- selling expensive BTC to the Luna team -- and exchanging the proceeds for billions of dollars worth of UST stable coin.

This creates a MASSIVE BTC short position for the attackers, setting them up for a kind of Soros style attack on both Luna and BTC.

Next, the attacker started selling the UST stable coin at such a fast rate that UST started losing its peg.

Of course... The Luna team had to sell all that expensive BTC and also sell Luna to restore the peg of UST to the US dollar. This has caused Luna, BTC and the entire market (including DOGE) to crash. 

Investors started freaking and dumping too, which has only worsened the dump.

CryptoCurrency,Is USDD next?,"From the USDD (TRON's Algorithmic Stablecoin) whitepaper:

""When 1USDD = 0.9USD, an arbitrageur can buy 1USDD with 0.9USD in the external market and then swap 1USDD for 1USD worth of TRX in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USD worth of TRX in the external market at 1USD. In this way, the arbitrageur spends 0.9USD to get 1USD, and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USDD will be burned, and 1USD worth of TRX will be minted. As the supply of USDD decreases, USDD's price will increase, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD.""

""Upon its establishment, the TRON DAO Reserve will set its basic risk-free interest rate to 30% per annum and facilitate other decentralized and centralized organizations that accept USDD to implement consistent interest rate policies.""

To me this sounds like another UST situation, a 30% risk free interest rate is not sustainable. And once the music stops USDD will de-peg like Luna.

personalfinance,Looking for some advice re: Home Equity Loans vs. Home Equity Line of Credit,"My wife and I are looking to finance some larger home improvement projects in the short term and have applied for a Home Equity Loan with our current bank (the same we do business with for banking as well as have our mortgage with). 

I have some questions that I don't seem to be getting great answers to from the loan specialist and thought I'd ask here for some advice. 

\- We like the idea of a Equity Loan basically due to the fixed APR and static payment amount over a set period.   The problem is the APR they've offered us starts at 7.8 for a 15 year, and 8.5 for a 20 year.   This is higher than any estimates I've seen on most bank sites, and surprising us given our credit and financial details.  We have credit scores over 800, plenty of income to qualify for the loan and not much debt currently (home, student loan, that's it).    Our house is also valued at twice what we purchased it for, and we have almost 50% of our buying price in equity paid so far. 

Question:  Are the low rates of 4-5 that I'm seeing on websites and ads right now just bait to lure people in?  Is our bank high in comparison to what anyone else is getting?  This seems like the time to lock in a fixed rate on an amount we know we need, but as high as 8 seems a little off. 

\- What is everyone's thought on going with HELOC right now?  Variable interest rates worry me in general, but uncertainty of this economy compounds that in my view.     That said, looking back at 40 years of history shows that it's uncommon for them to rise above 8%, so in that scenario they wouldn't be above what we're being offered for 8% for the loan anyway.

Bitcoin,A self-reflection as to why and how to hodl your Bitcoin from a newbie,"Just few days ago a friend panicked because Bitcoin and his ""diversified portfolio"" went down like crazy, and so did tech stocks. He's basically hiding under his blanket, not knowing where to go, helpless, and not being able to function well (he is heavily invested). Same with a friend who owns half a million in Bitcoin.

*All while I am secretly hoping to keep buying cheap.*

I'm quite new to the space, but I am frankly surprised how much others who have been through worse freak out so often. For us n00bs who just got in this year, I feel it's extremely important that if you are heavily invested in Bitcoin, from time to time follow the exercise of thinking what to do if Bitcoin hit an all-time low in an extremely short time, to the point that one would feel like ""all is lost"".

I am NOT saying that Bitcoin is going to zero. In fact I believe the opposite. I hold almost no fiat anymore. But it may go low enough, for long enough (or fast enough) for many people to panic into thinking this is going to happen, and sell at an incredible loss.

So here's the exercise I do often when I am having negative thoughts (if you never have negative thoughts you shouldn't be here, becoming the reincarnation of Buddha is far more profitable that Bitcoin).

Alright, here I go:

***Why am I invested in Bitcoin?***

Obviously I want huge, or at least a positive ROI (and anyone who tells you they don't is lying) but this won't happen overnight, so I spend about one or two hours every day reading books about Bitcoin, tech articles, and pure Computer Science math. This shit is hard, I often want to ragequit.

I have nightmares with elliptic curves or mnemonic seed words. But I remind myself the reasons why I believe Bitcoin can bring a big change to the world. No one knows how positive it can be but we can rest assured that the current fiat system is absolute crap for the 99% of us, so the bar is set very low.

***If I lost all my money (Bitcoin suddenly disappears, someone steals my keys or points a gun at my wife and tells me he knows how much I have and expects nothing less), what happens?***

I have a stable job, pays well enough so that I can start stacking again or getting my savings back in place. I have two children, so I need to take finances seriously. We have great social security.

It would be a very shitty situation, but it won't be life or death. I'll be able to perform normally after a weeks.

I don't own a house, a car, and the most expensive thing on our rental apartment is a US $1,000 sofa that we bought (I might sell it for Bitcoin, wife might get really pissed though).

I don't have any debt, stock, bonds, and my last CD (3% interest rate lol) is expiring soon -- as soon as it does it's going to my Bitcoin stack.

***If Bitcoin crashes for long enough to make me doubt, would I feel it's still worth it?***

Hell yeah. All the learning has put me on a higher level as a software developer: cryptography, math, security, privacy, anonymity, reading about countless hacks, best-practices, etc. I am learning rare and valuable skills, that can let me find great jobs with lots of flexibility like the one I have now.

If you're in Bitcoin for the wrong reasons, you might leave for the wrong reasons, and leave in the deep red.

Let's face it, if Bitcoin crashes, our chart-reading skills won't transfer into a well-paying job (alright alright, unless you live in Manhattan).

personalfinance,Paying down mortgage principle,"Looking for advice on this one.

We own two homes. Just purchased our second home and moved in yesterday.

On our first mortgage the payment is $2678.18/mo. For the past year while living there I have been laying an extra $321.84 to bring the total payment to $3k/mo. 

The mortgage rate on that home is 3.5%. Pretty good.

Now that we are renting the home out it will be only barely cash flowing at $2700/mo in rent. I am trying to decide if it’s worth continuing to pay over the minimum. Calculations show it would save about $61k in interest and 6 years 4 months off the loan.

Is it worth it with that interest rate? Could the $321 be used more effectively elsewhere?

A little background:
—1st mortgage (4BR 2ba home in burbs) $2678.18/mo
—2nd mortgage (1br 1ba condo in downtown major metro city) - $4400/mo ($700 of this is Heloc which we will pay down aggressively and another $500 is HOA dues)

business,How to Decide Interest Rate on Line of Credit to Partner Business,"Good day all,

I own a small Deaf access business. We partner with a company that provides a specific service, and it's mutually beneficial. We've become quite intertwined, and there's a lot of mutual trust. However, I'm not seeking opinions on the dangers of partnerships, so please try to stick to my question.

Both of our businesses have been experiencing growing pains as we have rapidly scaled over the past six months or so. We are better off because my father is able to front payroll before we are paid by clients. They don't have that kind of liquidity. For now, they rely on a friend for loans at an undisclosed interest rate. 

They have expressed interest in a blend of revolving credit facility and secured loan from us. This is interesting because we're protected if they can't pay by virtue of being the ones that pay them for services (hence the secured loan aspect). They need about $30,000 available to them when needed. We're going to talk to our CPA about drawing up an agreement. 

We're interested in providing the credit. However, I'm not really sure how to decide on a rate. These loans can be priced at anywhere from 10-40%, it seems, from what I've researched. Any advice on how to determine this rate would be much appreciated. And again, please, I'm not interested in the perils of this agreement.

personalfinance,Pay off all debt first or buy a house??,"Hello r/personalfinance. I never post but I constantly think about this so I figured why not. 

My girlfriend and I have been thinking a lot about home ownership and I think we want to start the process, but I have student loan debt, and a car payment I still have to take care of. I am 28 years old and I make pretty good money (at least I think). I owe about 10k on the car and about 55k in student loans. I am relatively new to financial literacy so please excuse me if I sound like an utter idiot in how Im describing my thoughts. I have about 15k in liquid cash that would go towards the down payment, I am think 5% conventional loan and I have family that would help assist a little in the down payment if my 15k wont cover it. That would be my entire checking account pretty much. My girlfriend currently does not contribute to expenses because she works part time while she finishes school. We have discussed that she will be paying her half as soon as she has a real job that allows that. She will have her masters in about a month, so Im not too concerned. That would significantly help me pay off debt while we lived in a home. Also, she has no debt. She owns her car and didnt take out student loans (shes a lot smarter than me). 

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear on the debt before I get questions. I was young, dumb, and naive when I took out the car and student loans. I had no idea what I was getting into at the time. The apps that track those debts (MOHELA for student, and the bank that financed my car loan has been absorbed by Premier bank so I have no idea how to readily pull this up.) are super useless and I DO NOT KNOW my interest rates. I signed a piece of paper because I wanted to go to college and I wanted a car. Not a good excuse, but its the one I have. I realize this is something I need to know ASAP before making any real decisions but keep in mind, Im on r/personalfinance because Im financially stupid, not financially literate. Otherwise, I wouldnt post here.

&amp;#x200B;

Income details: I make about 90k a year (pre-tax), and my take home is about 4400/mo. I pay about 2800/mo for my expenses each month (debt, rent, utilities, etc). These are close approximations. Ive got about 40k in my 401k (irrelevant to this discussion probably) and I have an individual account with play money I use for more riskier stock trades. I also am planning on opening a Vanguard or Fidelity Roth IRA here in the next week and adding more money to that for retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I rambled there and probably am coming across incoherent. I just want advice because I constantly question if I should debt snowball this stuff and pay off the car and student loans first, or if I should start building equity and get a home. Plus, there is this mental element to all of this that isnt really accounted for in the numbers. I hate renting. I hate living in an apartment. I feel so constrained and cant be myself. Its tiny and Im just sick of it. I have lots of hobbies and I want a garage and a place to work on my projects. It sounds so nice to me to have my own slice of heaven. That isnt really a good reason to make dumb financial decisions, but I kind of think it is to some degree.

stocks,Apple is no longer the worlds most valuable company by market cap.,"Saudi Aramco overtook Apple Inc. as the world’s most valuable company, stoked by a surge in oil prices that is buoying the crude producer while adding to an inflation surge that is throttling demand for technology stocks.

Aramco is near its highest level on record and with a market capitalization of about $2.43 trillion, surpassed that of Apple for the first time since 2020. The iPhone maker fell 3.9% in New York to $148.50, giving it a valuation of $2.41 trillion at 1:05 p.m. in New York

Even if the move proves short-lived and Apple retakes the top spot again, the role reversal underscores the power of major forces coursing through the global economy. Soaring oil prices, while great for profits at Aramco, are exacerbating rising inflation that is forcing the Federal Reserve to rise interest rates at the fastest pace in decades. The higher rates go, the more investors discount the value of future revenue flows from tech companies and push down their stock prices.

Earlier this year, Apple boasted a market value of $3 trillion, about $1 trillion more than Aramco’s. Since then, however, Apple has fallen by 16% while Aramco is up 27%.

personalfinance,"ELI5: Why it is worthwhile to invest money instead of paying the mortgage, if your interest rate is low","So I was discussing money matters with my partner, and we hit an interesting stumbling block in the conversation. I was trying to make the point that if our mortgage rate is fixed for 5 years at a low rate (2%), that over a very long-term, it makes more sense to invest *extra* money into something with a projected ROR that is higher than 2%. **This, I said, should remain true for as long as our projected ROR is higher than the interest rate on the mortgage.**

The conversation ground to a halt when my partner said: ""I don't think 2% interest on debt is simply cancelled out by 2% ROR on an investment."" For simplicity's sake, we are ignoring things like fees, taxes, etc. **We're really just talking about this straight relationship between investing in debt, and investing in returns.**

But I was at a bit of a loss to explain *why* you can, in fact, compare the two on equal planes. For some reason it felt like trying to come up with a mathematical proof for why 1+1=2 -- *it just is!*

I think the root of my partner's doubt was in the notion that the huge size of the mortgage makes any interest payable a big deal, whereas the rate of return on an investment of similar size is very small... or something like that?

I also think my partner was hung up on the idea that after our mortgage term is up, the interest rate could be *anywhere,* and so it was fundamentally dangerous to be very in-debt. My partner's point was also that it feels perpetually disadvantageous to always have one's profit margins eaten into by mortgage interest: *""wouldn't it be better to pay the entire debt,* ***then*** *invest in full force without debt interest constantly gnawing away at the ROR?""*

What I'm looking for is a detailed, correct, and to-code explanation on how to wire an ATS (a) on the utility side to feed the Generic ATS (b).  I'd feed the ATS (a)  utility as primary and inverter as secondary.  Grid goes down, solar/battery kicks in until a certain capacity on the batterie is reached when the generator kicks in.

In all cases, I'd like charging the batteries to happen both by solar and an option to charge via grid/generator power so that I can always have a battery buffer before the generator kicks in.  My main reason here is to give the generator a break once a day to let my neighbors sleep, check the oil, etc

Four years ago we both lost our jobs within a month of each other. Since my parents were renting and had already planned on relocating to be closer to us, they ended their lease and moved in with us to help us get back on our feet. Now that we’re back with stable employment, we’re ready to get back into a “normal” situation and out of the “emergency mode” that we’ve been surviving in over the last few years.

We would like to build an addition to our current home to give my parents more privacy and independence, but still keep them close. (And possibly use as a short term rental in the distant future..) We live in a college town and rentals in our area are all extremely high and primarily cater to students.

I am totally overwhelmed with options and don’t really know where to start. Is a refinance the best option? Is now a great or a terrible time to look at HELOC?

It is only 4% of VTI for the entire sector, compared to Google alone being 6% of VTI/VOO. So I feel like it adds some diversity to my base of indexes. The sector is massively outperforming and I think that could continue for the rest of the year minimum. We don’t need oil to be at record highs for these companies to be taking in record profits. Break even is somewhere around $40-65/barrel for most companies.  

**What to watch out for:** 1. The geopolitical risks, like how an eventual end of the war in Ukraine could affect oil prices or how someone like OPEC can change everything. 2. The saying with most commodities is that high prices solve high prices. Oil is cyclical because these companies often ramp up production and flood the market. On the demand side, it seems that high prices aren’t keeping people from traveling this summer(based on flights booked and hotel bookings). But if prices are so high that people don’t want to travel we have some issues. 

**Companies I like:** Big cap: $XOM, better than average dividend, great Q1 earnings. Announced a record $30 billion in share buybacks. Small cap: $VTNR: Vertex energy, $668 million market cap, oil refining company that bought another refinery from Shell in Mobile, Alabama in April. Recently crushed earnings. Had guidance saying they are expecting full year EBITDA of $350 million. Or &gt; half of their market cap.

2. Shorting ARKK ETF $SARK:  I know, the time to buy this was in February or March. But I still think this trends up with every rate hike because 1. The Nasdaq is everything interest rate hikes hate. 2. Cathie Wood only invests in that “growth story” unprofitable shit that’s getting slaughtered. And 3. I think she is one of the worst fund managers of all time(buying high and selling low regularly), and I kind of love betting against her even on days when her fund rebounds.  I messed with SQQQ and just didn’t care for the triple levered volatility. I also don’t trade with options for the same reasons. 
The only thing I don’t like about funds like this is the expense ratio. But it is fun enough to make up for it IMO.

TLDR: I like energy and I like shorting Cathie Wood. What, if anything, do you have in your portfolio to keep you sane/hedge?",finance,1652304342

CryptoCurrency,Post from Pomp about Biden and Crypto,"Post written in Anthony Pomp’s email:
——
The President of the United States gave a speech on inflation yesterday. He described the abnormally high inflation environment as his top domestic concern. While that would seem like a worthy focus of government officials, this acknowledgement of the problem was quickly followed with ridiculous gaslighting.

According to the President, the two main causes of high inflation are the once-in-a-century pandemic” and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There is no doubt that these two events are partially to blame, but it was quite shocking to see no mention of the undisciplined monetary and fiscal policy from central bankers and politicians over the last two years. Identifying the problem, while simultaneously refusing to accept any responsibility, is what adults expect from their pre-puberty children, not the President and his administration.

This wasn’t even the worse part though.

President Biden went on to share that his plan is to ask corporations to refrain from price gouging, along with increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. I honestly had to double-check to make sure I heard this correctly. If the plan to curb inflation is essentially chasing a boogey man of price gouging, while also increasing the costs for businesses through taxation, then we are all screwed.

So how are we doing with the long term impact of those short-term decisions?

The CPI data released this morning has pinned inflation at 8.3% and there are numerous reasons to believe that this metric is significantly underestimating the problem.  First, the breakdown of various goods is crazy to see: 

Price increases over last year (CPI report)
Gasoline: +43.6%
Used Cars: +22.7%
Gas Utilities: +22.7%
Meats/Fish/Eggs: +14.3%
New Cars: +13.2%
Electricity: +11.0%
Food at home: +10.8%
Transportation: +8.5%
Overall CPI: +8.3%
Food away from home: +7.2%
Apparel: +5.4%
Shelter: +5.1%

Gasoline is up 43% year-over-year and food at home is up nearly 11%. This is completely unsustainable for the average American family. But did you see that shelter is up 5% according to the CPI? That seems odd given that report after report is showing that both rent prices and real estate prices have increased closer to 20% year-over-year across the country. Hard to imagine that rent and real estate is up 20% and shelter is only up 5%.

But that isn’t the only issue with these numbers. There is a significant reason to believe that the metrics and calculations are actively being manipulated to show lower CPI numbers in real-time.

Not exactly an ideal situation, especially because the people who are hurt the most end up being the most financially vulnerable in our society.

This isn’t the end of the story though — the Wall Street Journal recently published an article on the 477 employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who are tasked with walking into physical stores to write down the price of various goods. It is WILD to think that we are using humans and manual data entry to track inflation in the 21st century.

This paragraph in the article stuck out to me:

“The job of a price-checker is exacting. To price an item, workers go through an up to 11-page list of data points to make sure they are pricing the same item they did the prior month. A can of soup has 12 different specifications, including flavor, size, brand, organic labeling, material of the packaging and dietary features, such as sodium content.”

So here we find ourselves with 8.3% inflation, an annualized GDP contraction of -1.4% in Q1, and a market that expects 10 total interest rate hikes before year end - culminating in a 3.0% interest rate. Hello, Mr Recession.

The last thing I want to cover today is a potential solution — unfortunately I don’t think the Federal Reserve or other central banks have many options. If they don’t act, inflation continues to worsen. If they aggressively act, inflation will come down but the recession will be nasty. Maybe the only potential solution is to do the minimum potential action to steer the market back towards a normal environment, while trying to avoid the recession.

Unfortunately, it seems nearly impossible for even the most skilled central banker to navigate this complexity. We are likely going to endure high-ish inflation and a recession at the same time. This won’t be fun. All investors can really do is either (a) sit on their hands and wait, or (b) hope they have cash on the sidelines ready to deploy as we seem more blood in the streets.

Stay safe out there my friends. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.

investing,What the Fed is really trying to fix,"Let’s get right down to it.

We know that the Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates (market expects rate to be at about 3% by year end) and it will trim its almost $9 trillion balance sheet. This balance sheet includes $2.7 trillion in mortgage backed securities (MBS). There are proposals to sell $30 billion in US treasuries and $20 billion in MBS per month.

The official narrative to this massive tightening of fiscal policy this year is to quell inflation. For context, Jan CPI was 7.5%, Feb was 7.9%, March was 8.5%, and today’s print for April came in at 8.3%. These are historically high inflation rates.

But I suspect the Federal Reserve isn’t actually targeting inflation. They are much more worried about something else.

This is why.

Inflation is a function of supply and demand. The Fed with their fiscal policy has decent but also blunt control over demand. It doesn’t have as much control over supply. Especially in this macroenvironment where supply is constricted by a war and pandemic lockdowns halfway across the world. Interest rate hikes and balance sheet runoff will not bring peace to Ukraine, nor will it slow spread of COVID in Shanghai.

In addition, we already see aggregate demand in a really bad spot, with GDP showing a rare 1.4% decline last quarter. Demand is pretty dead. Peloton is down 92.5%. People aren’t in the mood of buying.

So if the demand is already low, and Fed can’t control supply chain issues, how do they fix inflation with interest rate hikes and balance sheet sell off?

Answer is they can’t. CPI inflation is not what they care about.

Rather, the Fed is super worried about the housing market. We already see that the housing market price trends are significantly higher than the past decade’s upwards trend and I reckon the Fed is really worried about any sort of deleveraging in the housing market. Since about 26% of household wealth is tied to mortgages, if we start seeing foreclosures, significant household wealth will just vanish which will be deadly for the US economy.

Although cooling the housing market means pulling back the stock market, it’s a lesser evil since stocks are not usually purchased on leverage, while houses are typically always bought with leverage by majority of US pop.

Interest rate hikes and MBS sell off might not have much impact on inflation in this macroenvironment but they directly pare back home prices, and that’s where we think the Fed is targeting.",finance,1652311132

I pitched 100 reporters alone for an in person event and they, as a team of 5 (including someone at director level), pitched 35...THIRTY FIVE. I secured 4 press attendees and my colleague got interest in one virtual attendee who I doubt showed up. My agency also secured 'interest' for one virtual attendee, who I doubt showed up. 

I also told them very clearly ahead of this in-person event (that we paid for 3 of their reps to come to including two nights at a Mariotte) I wanted support filling out a content calendar based on the sessions they attended and thought leaders they could meet.

Today, they showed up to our meeting with a pitch plan and did not fill in any content calendar ideas AND they told me they don't write content. This would have been fine, but they could have told me this 4 weeks ago when I was giving very clear direction about my need for content support and this would fit in their scope of work if the content was repurposed for bylines.

I don't know how to politely bring up the fact that they have grossly under delivered and that they are even falling short on the media side. Their director shows up for calls and says basically a lot of nothing to fill time and to defend them, but I worked for an agency and understand the jargon they're using.

personalfinance,Dilemma: Late/lost cashier’s check for car down payment,"Hoping to get some validation that I’m stressing over nothing as my wife insists. Here’s the situation.

My wife and I do our banking online with a big national bank. They do not have a branch office local to us. We are in the process of buying a car. We went in for a test drive on Saturday not fully planned for a purchase that day. But we got lucky. They had the car we wanted and with the supply chain and dealer wait times what they are, we pulled the trigger. Initial paperwork was drawn up and we agreed to come back Tuesday evening with our down payment.

On Saturday I ordered a cashiers check from our bank…delivery schedule within one business day, which meant Tuesday delivery. It it now Wednesday evening and still no check. FedEx says it’s been out for delivery since 9am this morning. A FedEx. Truck showed up today, sat outside the house for a few minutes, then drive away without delivering anything. I didn’t want to be that guy and try to flag down the driver, but now kind of wish I did.

Tomorrow is the last day we can complete the car purchase as my wife will then be out of town for 10 days. The car is ready to go…insurance set, title/registration ready, financials drawn up with an agreeable interest rate, and the car has even been detailed. I can give it a few hours in the morning for the check to arrive, but then if we want the car we have to cancel the check and do a wire transfer instead (which I shouldn’t just done in the first place). I can’t see the dealer just agreeing to hold the car another 2 weeks.

What’s giving me anxiety is that the money for the canceled check may not be returned for up to 90 days (perhaps sooner if we receive the cancelled check and mail it back to the bank). To be clear, it’s not that we don’t have the money to cover the wire transfer in absence of that money. We’re fortunate to have enough of a cushion to cover it without dipping into emergency savings or anything like that. We really will not miss that money for a few months if it comes to that. I just hate the idea of a large sum of our savings floating out there in canceled check purgatory until the bank decides it’s safe for them to return it. Maybe I’ve just seen too many stories about people getting screwed over by the banks and having to fight to get money back that is rightfully theirs. 

Please tell me I’m over thinking this. As long as I get documentation from the bank that check is cancelled, the amount, and the terms for them returning the funds to our account, we should be good right? It’s not like we’re dealing with Jim Bob’s Saving &amp; Loan here…it’s a big national bank. 

The only other option is to cancel the car purchase and wait for everything to get sorted out before going back to make another purchase. Between waiting for funds to be returned  and supply chain issues with dealers it could very well be months before we could move forward with another purchase. We were trying to be proactive in replacing our car which could kick the bucket any day and is no longer suitable for long distance. So waiting it out that long isn’t really isn’t an option for us.

Please talk me away from the ledge here.",finance,1652318306

This process is ultimately very healthy for markets and I believe is ""the great purge"" to rid the market of the ""sins"" of the FED the last 12 (?)  years.

I've gotten to the point where I feel it really needs to fall to at least 3000 if not even 2400 or so.  That would put us back to the March 2020 low I think.

It would also be a great buying oppurtunity for future generations of investors!

Remember that as accumulators (myself included) (20 years till earliest retirement) we should be HOPING that this thing crashes and burns to the ground!

I'm not a bear, but I think we need this reset and we need the market at a fair valuation. I think that's about 2400.  I'll slowly start buying in though at 3500 or so share by share!

So seriously how far do you think the sp500 will go down by July? I'm guessing we may be at 3500 by then but I'm not sure.

The good thing is is that Tom Lee has a price target of 5200 by end of 2022 still which may be a little high, but nonetheless positive. Anyways someday we'll hit 5000, whether next year or 2024.

The good news is that if we buy into the sp500 at 2400 we'll have about 100% return to get back to even 4800!

That means if we fall to 2400 and you invest $50k, and we eventually get back to 4800, even in a few years you'll have $100k!!

You'll double your investment! This is why I'm hoping the market falls to at least 2400 cause I have about that much in cash to throw at the market!

Good luck to all!

I work a boring but super easy warehouse job that I absolutely hate making around 45k a year (which I'm told by people around here and that I work with that I won't find anything better around here and that the pay is good for this area but I still refuse to agree that it is a lot). I am a single male with no kids just my husky. I have a decent amount of emergency money saved up and I have a 401k set up that my company is matching. I also have some money invested in stocks and I'm trying to save up a nice amount of money to start a business in the near future.

So I was previously renting a house with a buddy when my mom decided she was going to sell her house. This house is my childhood home that my parents built when I was a baby so it's not very old and it has sentimental value as well. It's a 3 bed 3 bath with a decent sized yard and i think the square footage is around 2,150. Anyways the house appraised for 232k and my mom let me have it for 180k. She let me keep all her new appliances and furniture as well so I figured it would be dumb if I didn't take this deal whether it be me staying here long-term or just flip it for profit short term. So I bought the house in August 2021 and my interest rate is 2.875% and the mortgage with escrow together ended up being $1,221 a month. I knew that would be a little difficult to manage so now I have two roommates to help with that. I'm not very fond of having roommates but it's tolerable as long as they're paying rent. They almost cover my whole mortgage actually but they aren't the most helpful with hardly anything around the house and one has a dog that is a nuisance to me. I even caught the dog jumping on my car on my ring camera and left dirt and scratches on it. His room kinda stinks as well. 

So my question is do you think it would be wise to keep or sell my house? Should I just continue having roommates or sell the house and downsize when the housing market corrects a little more? I feel like it'll be hard to sell due to the sentimental value and it is a nice house after all but would it be the smartest decision to stay financially?

Edit: I'm planning on using my assets to make a 20% down payment, monthly payment would be $2804 (HOA included). It's a 2 bed 2 bath and I'm planning on renting out the 2nd bedroom.",finance,1652328029

personalfinance,Is buying an apartment too risky if refinancing it with over 6% interest rate would get difficult?,"So a good friend of mine wants to buy an apartment(were from Germany). 

The apartment seems like a good buy.  I am just scared that he maybe over-leverages too much. 
The price is under market value but the rent is low and also under market.

Interest rates have risen to about 3% here for 10 years fixed interests and to be able to pay the rate with rent only he wants to start out with 1% repayment rate. He also wants to finance the whole apartment without any down payment.

According to my calculations after the 10 years of fixed interest refinancing for over 6% interest would get difficult.
The apartment would make about -100€/month after tax then. That doesn’t seem like much but my friend bought 6 more apartments with in the last 5 years which all also need to get refinanced 5-10 years from now on. 

Is under those circumstances a 1%/year repayment rate + no downpayment to risky?",finance,1652328209
CryptoCurrency,TerraLuna sub and compassion…,"I just took a trip over to r/terraluna and I have to say, most of us are hurting right now but those people literally lost everything.

There is post after posts of users actively contemplating suicide after losing everything.

I know it’s easy to dunk on their terrible Lead as all of Kwon’s tweets are super cringe. After hearing the story of how his incompetence caused this project to fail it’s also easy to dunk on the investors.

But maybe take a moment to reach out, if that’s not brigading, lend some support.

After all, we all invested in cryptocurrency to hopefully have a better life, break free from the corrupted FED, the manipulative stock market, to be our own bank…just to for a hope of having an edge in this life where literally EVERYTHING is harder, more expensive, and stressful. 

There is always a way out, if you feel hopeless, talk to someone.

investing,Supply chain shock will likely get slightly worse before it gets better,"As Shanghai lockdown goes into its end, we would expect supply bottlenecks ease a little bit. But the short term shock is still to be felt. The largest increase in CPI is most likely March as oil jumps. But the largest increase in PPI might still be ahead of us as the shock unravels. 

As an example, major car companies will likely have to halt production for a short period of time after parts run out (before they got replenished). Tesla is experiencing that in Shanghai. Smaller companies might be able to secure some parts but the productivity will likely but adversely affected.

What does this mean for stocks?

1. Earnings will be ugly for companies that are more reliant on just-in-time delivery of parts to conduct normal production. So expect delays for companies that does complicated manufacturing. If they resort to increasing prices, their sales will be down. Not an easy way out for Q2 earnings.

2. PPI will likely get a shock to the upside, leading to more persistent inflation and likely giving fed more reasons to not stop rate hikes. I would say another 50 basis points on top of the scheduled three 50 basis points. Then afterwards few 25s.

3. The market might react adversely to the PPI news, or at least very sensitive to it. Expect soaring VIX before CPI/PPI releases for June and July.

The good news is that, after June and July, mostly at the second half of this year
1. China comes out of the lockdown and begin normal production again, supply chain will likely improve during the later half of the year. Freight costs will go down. Inflation will edge downward as well.
2. Some domestic measures such as  gas tax reduction or tariff reduction, we will see inflation drop as well.

The market will likely react positively to these news as supply eases to meet the demand.

Just to note that another uncertainty comes from the Ukraine crisis. If European countries are all hell bent on getting off Russia oil, their economy will be wrecked. I hope that cooler heads prevail and every stakeholders, Ukraine, Russia, the US, Europe and China can work together to come to a peaceful resolution. It’s too bad what Ukrainian people have to suffer this much.",finance,1652333386

CryptoCurrency,A word on projects that advertise high returns or high staking rates.,"I have brought attention to this many times before over the years since the rise of Defi happened in 2020. I think now more than ever people need to be aware of the risks involved when they come across projects that advertise high interest/staking rewards or high returns.

Vitalik did a tweet roughly when Defi took off and he summed it up pretty well. https://nitter.net/vitalikbuterin/status/1274443124375523329?lang=en

Everyone wants to make money, and projects out there capatalise on this. They draw in people by offering high interest rates, but everyone should always exercise caution and investigate *how* they can offer these high interest rates, and if their model is sustainable. Some things to consider, where exactly are the advertised returns coming from? Why aren't other more established projects doing this? Is their idea *really* that unique that no one else is doing it, or capable of doing it?

This applies not only before you have discovered such a project, but even if you have already invested in one.

Now to go on a tangent and speak more broadly.

If someone draws light onto something they think is not quite right, do not take this as a personal attack. I understand people will say things that you do not want to hear and this can be especially difficult when money is on the line. However this doesn't necessarily mean that what they are saying is correct, you should always come to a conclusion yourself based on the facts.

People can and will easily dismiss anything ""negative"" that is said because it is ""wrong"" and may even gloat about how they got the advertised return themselves so it is all fine and that what was being said is just ""FUD"". Based on how the upvote/downvote system works on Reddit, you may even be questioning your own judgement depending on which community you are in or who is participating in that thread.

Just remember that re-evaluating your opinions and beliefs based on new evidence is absolutely not a weakness, it is a sign of having a strong mature mind which we should all aim to be doing.",cryptocurrency,1652334964

CryptoCurrency,"A portfolio that’s down 90% is a portfolio that was down 80%, and then fell by another 50%","As markets have been going all sorts of crazy, and as cryptos have taken the brunt of all the inflation and rate hike worries as well as the growth slowdown scares, we’ve seen levels of intraday volatility that we haven’t see since the COVID collapse. 

My personal view is that everything is going to continue going to shit over the next few months before we start to see a recovery. Fixed Income markets are pricing in a buttload more Fed hikes, equity markets are pricing in a manufacturing and services recession on a year over year basis, and consumers are feeling the pinch on their wallets. Everything is pointing to a slowdown, and when that comes to fruition, markets are going to puke again - more than they have done already. 

However, the bright shining spot is that when everything seems to be at its worst, that is when the Fed and other central banks will come in with more easing to boost us out of the mess, and asset markets like crypto will take off.

Until then though, do not be greedy just because you’re able to buy everything on a discount. You can still very easily half your money, or be down another 80%. 

DYOR, have a view about markets, and when you think we’re getting close to the bottom, dollar cost average in. Don’t be greedy because remember, a portfolio that’s down 90% is just a portfolio that was down 80% and then fell another 50%.",cryptocurrency,1652337118

CryptoCurrency,What I don’t get?,"First off, been in the crypto game for a hot minute, back when you could mine a btc on your own laptop (why I didn’t keep those I’ll never stop asking myself). Regardless, my question probably to an economist or something is… Why does does all this instability in the world: famine, war, disease, homelessness, climate change, etc….. such a downer on decentralized currencies. You’d think that with such rampart corruption amongst various governments, threats of war looming and what have you, that people would be welcoming to the idea of saying, “fucking I’m not sure if our currency will even be worth anything soon, this seems like a better alternative!” 

   It’s easy to send and receive. There are so many options, and I know many don’t use it for anything but an investment, I’ve legitimately used it for a while on various online pages that accept it. Hell, even Tesla was accepting it for a bit. So why this general attitude of people saying, well it’s not real, it’s not backed by the federal government.. blah. Blah. Blah. So what, the more unstable the world gets the more idiotic most governments begin to look. Why put full trust in a government that can’t even figure out how to properly handle healthcare, housing, wealth gap separation, and a whole slew of issues that would fill a library. Wouldn’t most people,  prefer to say fuck off, if this crypto thing is acceptable currency in so many places I’m just using that! Although to that extent, we definitely do not have enough places for that to be feasible… none the less why such a tentative poke it with a stick attitude toward a technology that could potentially Safeguard your assets much more than a bunch of old dudes who’s sole goal is gathering your money in an inconspicuous way as possible?",cryptocurrency,1652340613

CryptoCurrency,Important Crypto rules!,"Dont get fooled!! The instis and leverages caused this dip. All people staked non stakable coins to „earn“ interest. What were you guys thinking how these interest rates are achieved? 

You lended out your coins. They were literally moved out of your walled. Then the exchange lenses it again and again and again…no surprise that this dip was coming… even without the Russian war against Ukraine or covid. 

I posted some crypto rules and nobody followed it. I tell you it can go even lower!

Important Crypto Rules:

For everyone who think options horsebets and staking non-stakable coins will give him massive gains or who had liquidations in the last days:

crypto rules:

1. hodl
2. buy the dip (best before whales)
3. never sell at a loss
4. don't do leverage trading / options / derivates
5. don't do margin trading
6. don't stake crypto that is not meant to be staked
7. don't lend crypto to exchanges (or anybody)
8. best case store it in a cold wallet
9. only invest what you can afford to loose (or hodl long time)
10. ignore FUD - do your own research on your investment

This rules all are important!!",cryptocurrency,1652347658
stocks,Now will people admit we were in a bubble.,"I remember about a year ago how many people were debating it on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ke9vze/reading_about_the_dotcom_bubbleit_seems_exactly/gg1cdj9/?context=3) and people blasted and downvoting anyone that stated it was a bubble.  Saying it is different now - yes, causes are different

* Interest rates
* Different economy
* Technology revolution in the business segment (work from home)
* Stimulus
* Retail investors

BUT STILL A BUBBLE with a crash / correction.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned my lesson during the Dotcom bubble. I thought I was a ""F""-ing genius with QCOM and few others from 1998-2000 and all the Y2K hoopla. In mid-late Jan, there was like a 10% drop - ""I am a f-ing genius, rushed in to buy the dip""; by mid March-April, lost $300K and got out it.

It taught me a valuable lesson, **max out retirement accounts** with low cost mutual funds and **save 15% cash of yearly income** for emergencies, after that than **purchase blue chips names and reinvest dividends**.

Then and only then develop a \~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD. For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.

It also taught me to have a **strategy** on both the **upside run** and to manage **downside risk** (if any drops by \~15% I am out but will watch). On the upside, I take profits at 25% and if its 50%, I sell 1/2 - 1/3 and let the remainder ride and not really tracking it. (Today those stocks include FB, BABA, CC, AMD, and LLY.)

So when the crash happen in 2008, I was well positioned and rode it out. Retiring early and been enjoying the good life.

Today, I have a speculative portfolio to keep my mind active.  I will ride this crash out and look for opportunities for my speculative portfolio.

Good Luck.

stocks,Life is more than money and you shouldn't take your life due to it.,"The first time that I entered the stock market was way back in 2017, when AMD was still at $11. I was 100% sure that it would go up since semiconductors are the future, and it was being shorted and so undervalued. But as a newbie in the stock market, I panic sold at a loss (I could've been up 900% if I had held!). For years, I was on and off the stock market just looking at different tickers. Since I was a very low-risk taker back then, I didn't try to time the market.

Then 2021 happened. I saw the $GME post before it went up. I was very skeptical of him. I didn't buy $GME. But a few days later, $GME went through the roof. I missed out on it. I said to myself, ""Never again.""

Having missed on $GME, this is where I go full on YOLO ""trader"". At first, I bought $ID*ě*X stocks, which increased my investments three-fold. Then, $SN\*L. I thought to myself, ""There's going to be a future cannabis federal legalization."" (It didn't happen though.) I YOLOed all of my earnings again, and I gained an additional 300% off of them. I also invested heavily in $SOXL but didn't have a lot of gain from it. I converted my motorcycle into a bobber with the profits. It took a while to get it fixed (about 6 months), and so I used my scooter as a daily driver.

But things took to a dive. I got into a self-caused accident. (There was a hump in the middle of the road, and I was driving about 30 mph. I flew). I was reckless. I didn't use a helmet. I didn't even have any gear - just a short sleeve and shorts, but I still survived. I was bedridden for weeks. The pain in my body was so bad that the pain meds didn't do crap. It really gave me a view of reality that life isn't about having money but having the best of life. Luxury goods give you an ego boost for a few days, but it will always fade away. That's just me though. I really don't care about yachts or lambos. I started doing things that I didn't want to do, and it made me happy. I experienced things that I wouldn't have dreamed of. Get away from your comfort zone. You can be taken at any time without even reaping the benefits of your labor.

Fast forward to today. Half of my portfolio is down ($SPY, $SDIV, some gaming stocks, and *ě*TH).

If you're thinking of ending your life, please don't.

You can not buy another life, but life can get you another money.

TL;DR: I made some money in the stock market. I got into a motorcycle crash without even benefiting from it. I changed my view of life from focusing on just getting money to focusing on having fun and getting money. Life is more than just money, so don't kill yourself.",finance,1652351442

CryptoCurrency,We’re coming down to buying pizza with Bitcoin levels of panic,"Many of you have heard the story before. But for those that didn’t, some 10 odd years ago, there was a Florida man who had some bitcoin. Now this is in 2010 when bitcoin was just worthless “magic internet money”. So, this gentleman proceeds to call his local pizza shop and order two boxes of pizza. I think the total may have come out to $40 which was also the price of bitcoin. He bought his pizza and must have thought he was the world’s biggest genius since he basically got free pizza. That man’s name was Laszlo. 

Fast forward the clock 10 years and that same Bitcoin is worth $69k.

So, other than this was an entertaining story, what lessons have we learned from Laszlo? Today’s prices don’t match tomorrow’s valuations. 

You have a few options to make as the world crashes and burns before our very eyes. Keep your money in cash, buy real estate, buy stock or buy crypto. 

Let’s evaluate the pros and cons of each of these options:

1. Keep your money in cash 

Pros: you don’t lose all of your money. You lose some of it due to the inflationary nature of money. $100 today loses value and you have $90 tomorrow 

Cons: you don’t grow your money. No risk, no gain. You keep the $100 (now $90) without any chance of growing your savings

2. Buy real estate 

Pros: you grow your money. A lot, even. Buying a house is possibly the safest and best growth asset one can have 

Cons: it costs a lot to invest into real estate. This is if you’re buying a single family house to live in. If you’re planning to go into it as a career, that’s another story

3. Buy stock 

Pros: you may grow your money, with some risk of losing it. 1-5% growth would be a generous scenario with 10-30% growth being an insanely profitable situation 

Cons: you may lose your money. As the fed strengthens the dollar, you will see the markets continue to drop 

4. Buy crypto 

Pros: stock but on steroids. 10-30% growth is child’s play, 500-10,000% is more of a reasonable expectation. 

Cons: you may lose your money. As the fed strengthens the dollar, you will see the markets continue to drop 

So, you need to sit down and think hard on what makes sense at this time. The world will continue to crash and burn. We’re no where near the bottom of this. 

If the aim of crypto is to buy low and sell high. Well, we’re about to find out how low this thing can get. This is the time to DYOR, pick the projects that you think will survive this bear market and invest into them. 

Don’t be like Laszlo. And buy some pizza or a nice shirt with your assets. Or that could be the most expensive pizza that you’ve bought in your life.",cryptocurrency,1652357386

personalfinance,US - 5/5 ARM with low rate but high APR? Scam? High rate with low APR? What's going on here??&gt;,"So, I found some pretty low rates at a credit union in San Diego:

https://www.sdccu.com/CURates/HomeLoanRates.pdf

They offer a 5/5 ARM, the rate is super low, 2.625%. What I don't get is that the APR is listed as 4.3%, even though they supposedly pay for closing costs. 

OTOH, Wells Fargo lists their interest rate for a 7/6 Jumbo ARM at an interest rate of 4.250% with a APR that's lower than the interest rate: 3.768% (https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/rates/). And that's with 0 points. That's an APR that's *lower* than the interest rate, and lower than the SDCCU rate!

APRs are supposed to be a regulated thing, right? So what's going on here?




After some research I've concluded the following:

&gt;ARM APRs are supposed to be calculated with the assumption that rates more or less remain stable. So for a 5/5 ARM they're supposed to calculate your initial rate for 5 yrs and then for the last 25 years what would happen to the rate if it was adjusted today.

&gt;What's happening with SDCCU is that they're giving an awesome introductory rate, and their rate adjusts to market in 5 years, more or less, resulting in the 4.3% APR.

&gt;The wells fargo rate, on the other hand, starts higher (4.25%), but their current index (called COSI), is low : 0.13%. If you add wells' margin (assume 3%), you get something like a 3.125% rate. But their COSI is updated monthly, so this is probably not actually going to hold in the current rate environment.


And the SDCCU offer actually seems to be pretty good:

&gt; Looking into it more it seems like SDCCU has the best option if you believe rates will go to 10%+

&gt;WF's 5/6 is 4.5% with 2% cap and 5% max. If interest rates go up to 10% by year 5 and stay above, you'll hit the max by year 6.5, at 9.5%.

&gt;OTOH, SDCCU's 2.675% with 2% cap and 6% max would hit only 4.675% by year 5, 6.675% by year 10 and only hit 8.675% at year 15 (with less opportunity/frequency to adjust down).

&gt; More or less SDCCU's rate is super low and the 4.675% for year 5-10 is actually competitive with 10/1 ARM products available from WF.

tl;dr; it seems that WF uses some shady reporting practices for their ARMs in the current rate environment and the credit union actually offers a pretty great product.",finance,1652358546

I have my car paid off. For my house, I have a mortgage for another 10 years with monthly payments of $1109. I have a loan for a house remodel that only has $14k left to pay off.

I have about $60k in 401k savings and I have a personal stocks valued at about $5k (not much but in the last year I started learning about investments other than 401k).

So…we have high inflation rate, which is are supposedly suppose to be temporary because of supply chain issues. But the source of these supply chain issues don’t appear to look resolved anytime soon, so the inflation rate has stayed consistently hot for a couple of months and looks like it will for the for the forseable future. So the fed is raising rates, which has caused the stock market bubble to burst, but barely tame inflation, as to tame inflation yoi have to raise rates above the rate of inflation.


So now we’re in a situation where, if the minimal rate hikes don’t curve inflation, they’ll have to raise them much higher, which will crash the economy. Or the FED will ignore this, and inflation will continue to run hot, causing significant dollar devaluation. 

And the fed is hoping that this becomes resolved via supply chain issues that don’t look like they’re going to end anytime soon?",finance,1652359439

* Interest rates are now at 5.5%

* Estimated monthly cost of house payment, HOA, insurance, PMI, and taxes is $4100
* Market cools from 20% growth to more like 3-7%
* After 2 years I would have $110-160k in equity in the house

Hi guys, the above link is to my original post where someone stole my identity and took 20k from my savings. After consulting with my bank, they returned my 20k fully. I did all the necessary actions, closed accounts froze my credit on Expedia, police report and etc. 

However, PENFED, the credit union that withdrew the ACH deposit from my savings told me that they need to do their own fraud investigation . They told me I need to provide them with a notarized affidavit, along with a police report. Sure. I provided them the affidavit, police report, statement from my bank that my they concluded the fraud investigation and will be fully refunding my 20k.

personalfinance,"Pension disbursement from UK brother in law, we live in the US","Hello! 

I've found really conflicting things about whether this counts as a windfall or inheritance in the US so I'm wondering if anyone has experience or advice for our situation.

My BIL died in November and most of his estate went to his father, who is a pensioner in his 90s. This is relevant because it's also very likely we will get 1/3 of that estate when he passes so this might again be relevant in the near future. Back to my BIL, it turns out he had a pension with his employer that was to be disbursed equally to his immediate family if he died.

And today we had $78K wired into our checking account. Which is annoying because I guess they got the pound on a weaker day. ANYWAY.

The first things we were going to do is fund our anemic IRAs for the year. I have a standard IRA that was a rollover from a 401k, an existing 401k from an old employer and a 457 plan entirely funded by my current employer. My husband has a state retirement account (like a 401k) and a Roth IRA. Our retirements are um, not funded well. I have about 30k and my husband has about 20k. We're in our late 40s.

As for debts we have a 2.5% interest rate on our 30 year mortgage with no PMI (we prepaid it with our down payment) so we were going to hold off on paying down any capital. Our car is totally paid off and we have $500 in credit card debt that would have been paid off this month anyway. So our only real debt is our mortgage with an easily maintainable monthly payment.


According to what I've found if it's an inheritance under 100k in my state (Oregon) it's not going to be taxed but I've read other things about windfalls so honestly I'm confused since ""brother in law's pension was disbursed from the UK to me"" isn't exactly a common search term.

We do know that it was post tax in the UK as my other in-laws did not have to pay additional (and believe me the UK government would make sure it got taxed if there was tax to be taken.)

I don't know if it's worth going to see a financial adviser or a tax attorney with experience with international estates? I chose the flair ""taxes"" since that seems to be the first question before we can figure out how much we actually have.

Thank you for any advice you can give.",finance,1652371308
CryptoCurrency,Most dollar pegged stablecoins seem to be under attack this week. How long until the government steps in to announce a Federal Reserve coin?,"Just what the title says.

Not a grand conspiracy or something but we know that politicians and people in power's motto is ""never let a good crisis go to waste"".

Seems the perfect kind of crisis to point the finger at stablecoins and announce a government backed stablecoin, promising safety.

And probably a lot people in crypto would be happy to accept it and capitulate, when before they would never ever have, and would have gone against their own ideals. 

Personally im still against government backed stablecoins, as it is a very dangerous slippery slope to go to. 

Just calling for more transparency from the developers team, and we will probably see a lot of not-so-good projects tumble down. This is a call to responsibility from the dev team and everyone to read the fucking whitepaper.

personalfinance,how to handle partial trad-to-roth conversion that made earnings (TDA),"Hello,

In 2021 I made a $6k roth contribution at TDA at the start of the year. I later received a raise that pushed me partially out of the income limit. I have already filed an extension on my taxes, so nothing to worry about there. I recharacterized $2400 of the contribution to a traditional IRA, but there were earnings on the amount, so the final amount recharacterized was $2623 which is now sitting in cash in my traditional IRA. I would like to convert the amount to my Roth, but I'm not sure how to handle the earnings.

\- Do I just submit a full conversion and they figure out the tax stuff? Or should I do a conversion of the $2400 and then another one for the $223?

\- How do I pay the amount owed? Can I just put federal withholding of 10% and that will take care of it? Or if not, will it just show up on my next year tax bill?

\- Do I need to do anything extra when I report it on my taxes??

Any help would be appreciated. I've tried reading up on it but there's so many scenarios out there that I just want to be sure I'm not making a big mess of things. Should I just hire a professional now? I am for sure going to do it going forward, but not sure if I can just step into an advisor's office and tell them all this and not make it worse lol

personalfinance,Buying a car: pretending to “lose” on interest rate but planning to pay it off soon after,"I enjoy a good negotiation. It’s been so long since I bought a car. Paid cash for the two cars we have now over 10 years ago. 

Currently my cash is a bit tied up (apparently stock markets do go down…) but would have more than enough to pay for a car in cash but not immediately liquid so want to finance it and then pay it off soon after, maybe in a couple of months. 

I know one of the levers of negotiation is the interest rate on the auto loan along with obviously the purchase price and trade in. 

I was just wondering if it’s possible to pretend to “lose” on the auto loan rate and getting charged a higher rate than my credit score allows (800 credit) while having them lower the purchase price a bit is a viable strategy. 

After a month or two, I would just pay off the loan. 

I would just have to make sure there’s no prepayment penalty or something.

defi,Stablecoin Risks,"I'm a blockchain developer and researcher. I also work with government from time to time, as a contractor. My work has allowed me to have a few chats with ex-officials over the years, all of whom are concerned about crypto, especially stablecoins. I would like to enumerate some of the risks and truths of stablecoins, to save you pain in the future.

Here is me warning about stablecoins a month ago, when only a handful of people were thinking about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/tw9i3y/explanation_of_different_stable_coins/i3eqczz/

So you know in advance, this is not FUD; I am a crypto maximalist but am not loyal to any particular token. The more critical you are of these technologies, the better they get in the future. A good project is able to thrive despite the harshest criticism.

1. Algorithmic stablecoins are inherently risky. The algorithms used are generally open-source and there are rooms, all over the world, full of the smartest people you've ever met thinking about how to break these algorithms. Why? Because breaking these algorithms allow them to make lots of money. Your money. Even if these rooms didn't exist, you'd have to trust these algorithms not to implode from an unexpected event. The problem is that life is full of unexpected events and algorithms are full of assumptions. Don't be a skydiver who is 99% right.

2. Stablecoin risk is immeasureable. This is an experimental technology and experiments often fail. If we knew all the risks, we would account for them so failures wouldn't happen.

3. You are easy to fool. The Bitcoin blockchain was founded as an anonymous, tech-first project. Yet, almost everyone today (including VCs), when investing, wants to know who developed the project and what the project is going to do in the future. This is inherently wrong. The right way is to analyze the codebase and look for quality, mission-critical programming, but most people can't read code. Because of that, you need to understand a substantial part of any gains made is due to luck, not genius. And no one is lucky forever. A good question to ask in the future is: ""what do developers think about this project?""

4. An often overlooked risk is Key-Man risk. If the founder of the project dies, does the stablecoin die, too?

5. The world is full of information and we can't possibly consume it all. It's always possible you don't have all the information and, if you had just a bit more, you'd reach a completely different conclusion. Because of this, you should be wary of every new project, no matter how exciting it sounds. All good developers are committed to the technology, at least for a few years. It's ok to wait a year or two or more to see how a project unfolds before putting money into it.

6. A genuinely good stablecoin probably involves an economist or two. Or should. In other words, it should not just be a team of frat bros trying to make money (which is what most stablecoins are). Instead, there should be some kind of real expertise there, that understands all the underlying machinery that makes a currency work. Large groups of people can be complex and unpredictable at times, so their use of stablecoins can be complex and unpredictable, too. Having a couple of people who know what tools are available to fix specific problems, because they've studied these kinds of problems for years and years, is probably a good idea.

7. Should stablecoins exist? Yes, absolutely. We need an alternative to the US dollar and Euro and Yuan. My best guess is that a stablecoin is best managed with a DAO, which elects new monetary policy leaders every couple of years. Why? Because there will always be bad leaders, and you need a way to keep the good ones and remove the bad ones, and voting is an effective way to do that. Decentralization is about removing the need to trust strangers, and we can't do that if we keep trusting teams of frat bros in suits to keep stablecoins stable. I'm not saying frat bros can't do a good job; I'm saying, when things go badly, how will you remove these people from power?

There has been no other time in history when financial innovation happened so widely and quickly than right now. If the financial system ever failed anyone, if it has ever failed you, right now is the time to change that. This is why I believe in crypto--and why you should, too.

Stablecoins will fail, and will continue to fail, until one day, when we get them right. That's how it is with everything important. Don't go all-in. Take it slow; let projects prove themselves to you. DeFi is for the people, and that's you, and that means you control all the power.",cryptocurrency,1652386491

investing,Holding bonds to maturity,"Just to preface, I’ve done the basic homework and I think I have a working understanding of the relationship between bond price and interest rate (rate to maturity) and the effect of the current rising rates environment. 

Here’s where I could use some clarification. As I understand it, the market is pricing in expectations of further rate increases in the prices of bonds thus forcing lower interest bonds to sell at a discount (adjusted for credit risk). Thus, if the market is efficient, and (importantly) investor is planning to hold to maturity, one could expect current rates to already be in line with future (higher) rates. 

Still, bond prices are continuing to fall and the current general sentiment seems to be that they are not yet an attractive risk-adjusted investment. Guided by the general understanding that anything that has intrinsic value (once again ignoring credit risk for now) has to be an attractive investment when discounted deeply enough, at what point does that happen to bonds as long as one plans to hold them to maturity.

stocks,"Powell Sees More ""Pain"" Ahead, Admits 'Soft Landing' Is 'Out Of Fed's Control'","Some of the important parts of Powell recent interview:


Powell: So you can see that inflation is just way too high here in the United States. And by the way, the same all over the world, really, the global economies all around the world have been hit by a series of inflationary shocks and, pretty much, I just came back from a set of meetings with central bankers from around the world, and we’re all facing the same kind of issues and the public are facing the same kinds of issues.

Ryssdal: Worse here, though, worse here, to be clear, right?

Powell: Some places worse, some places better. We’re facing different challenges, but then again our economy’s more fully recovered, they may be just behind us in time. But what would I say to that person? So I would say that we fully understand and appreciate how painful inflation is, and that we have the tools and the resolve to get it down to 2%, and that we’re going to do that. I will also say that the process of getting inflation down to 2% will also include some pain, but ultimately the most painful thing would be if we were to fail to deal with it and inflation were to get entrenched in the economy at high levels, and we know what that’s like. And that’s just people losing the value of their paycheck to high inflation and, ultimately, we’d have to go through a much deeper downturn. And so we really need to avoid that.

“If things come in better than we expect, then we’re prepared to do less,” Mr. Powell said.

“If they come in worse than when we expect, then we’re prepared to do more.”

Then he poured cold water on the idea of a 'soft landing' that so many asset-gatherers and commission-rakers are constant telling investors is likely:

“There are huge events, geopolitical events going on around the world, that are going to play a very important role in the economy in the next year or so,” Mr. Powell said on Thursday.

“So the question whether we can execute a soft landing or not, it may actually depend on factors that we don’t control.”

Furthermore Powell comes clean on his ""transitory"" inflation epic-fail:

I have said, and I will say again that, you know, if you had perfect hindsight you’d go back and it probably would have been better for us to have raised rates a little sooner. I’m not sure how much difference it would have made, but we have to make decisions in real time, based on what we know then, and we did the best we could. Now, we see the picture clearly and we’re determined to use our tools to get us back to price stability.",finance,1652389989
Bitcoin,Bitcoin grew up in a period of time with low interest rates by the FED and ECP. Will higher rates change the next Pre- &amp; Post-Halving market?,"Yes I know the evil Fiat-System with their money printers. But we have to acknowledge two things:

First: Crypto market and the stock market are not totally disconnected. If the eg. S&amp;P500 will lose another 20-30%, the crypto market will not likely go up without reacting to this. 

Second: Most of its time. I would say all of its time since it’s a real investment asset, Bitcoin grew up in a time of cheap fiat money. 

If the rates will go up because of this self made inflation wave, will this change the behavior of the halving cycle? 
Like: 
- the pre-halving ATM was never touched in the next post-halving bear market (in this case 20k)
- after a halving a new bull market starts within 6-12 month and will set a new significant bigger ATM

In financial reality we have the great bubble (of debt) growing which suppresses value of the real hard assets. Those who bought into it and did not escape in time , will only loose.

FED using blackrock&amp;co is crashing markets, once they bottom , will buy on cheap to hedge themselves from what comes next. Pivot on interest rates and restart of QE which is printing into oblivion = collapse of purchasing power of fiat currency.

At that point FED (establishment, Gates,Soros) will hold stocks backed by productive hard assets. All central banks will also hold massive amount of precious metals , backed by own weight.

Somebody must hold the bag and that somebody will be public holding fiat and USDT (thin air) backed crypto.

personalfinance,"I want to become a nurse, but I’m scared to take out more loans.","A little background. 22M, stuck living at home with parents, graduating from college this month with a B.S. in Kinesiology. My understanding is there is no job market in kinesiology, and the degree alone is relatively useless professionally. However, I have a lot of pre reqs done that are necessary for nursing, PA or MD (i.e - A&amp;P, Microbiology, Chemistry), and I have the grades, so I’m looking to go that route. My plan is to volunteer in the hospital, find some paid experience in a timely manner, then do an accelerated bachelors of nursing (ABSN) program to get into the field.

The problem is, I’ve never moved out and therefore have no sense of how to budget. I commuted to save money and got a couple scholarships here and there, but I am still graduating ~$30k in federal student loan debt. If I choose to do this program I’ll have to take out ~$50k in privatized loans for tuition alone, and that’s not including rent, gas, etc. I really want to do this and become a nurse, but I’m scared that I won’t be able to financially recover from such a position. What would you do? Any resources, guidance, or advice is much appreciated.

EDIT: I found an ADN program at a community college near home that is ~7K, which is way more affordable. I will be working part-time and getting volunteer experience (both things are valuable to my career development) then apply to the program. Thank you all for the insight and help!",finance,1652432351

Furthermore, if they have held onto their assets for one year or more, they will not have to pay taxes on the money they make from the crypto sales.

The Federal Finance Ministry of Germany issued 24 pages of guidelines defining blockchain technology ideas like airdrops, staking, masternodes, mining, and tax charges against sales and purchases of cryptocurrencies. If someone doesn’t have to do anything to receive an airdrop, they won’t have to pay income tax on it.

It is made entirely of wood besides the support beams, the screening is flimsy and stapled in so replacing is difficult, and the wood was not well treated so some spots are starting to show signs of rotting (bottom is level with the ground, and the wood meets the ground at a slope). Due to being only screen and ground level, the floor gets disgusting (thanks pollen), and it's only useable if we continuously clean it only for it to get dirty the next day.

We had a contractor come out and give us a quote for a three season and four season renovation. They came out to around $31k and $40k, respectively.

So my main question is, is it smart to try and finance this? Or wait until we can pay mostly cash. The contractor gave us an option of paying it off in 12 months, no interest, or finance for 10 years with a 5.99% interest rate. I think the payments came out to $120 and $200 a month, respectively, for financing, and for the 12 months ""like cash"" payments it would be...a lot. 

To give some background on where we are financially:

* $11,000 in savings ($600 in car insurance comes out every 6 months)
* ~$7200 take home pay after contributing employee matching percentages to both our 401ks
* $1300 mortgage
* $800 in car payments (2 cars, paying $50 extra/month on each)
* $1200 in student loans (currently going into savings until concrete news on if there will be forgiveness or not. If not, we will dump into our loans come August when interest starts accruing again)
* $350 for internet, water, and electricity
* $190 for phone bill (paying off 2 phones + service)
* $~1000 for groceries, gas, misc other things that come up.
* There's a lot left over right now, as my spouse just recently got a job and we were previously living off of only my income ($5000/month). So, admittedly we need to really re-allocate our budget, but again this is what we're working with. 

We were also told that even the three season room can be added into the square footage of our house if we add heating. The contractor told us this could literally be a heater from Lowe's, as long as it's rated for heating 200 sq. ft. I am still unsure if this is true or not after attempting to Google it. The four season has two layers of glass, and we were told that this would make it definitely included in our square footage (maybe adding in a separate HVAC? can't recall this part).

Would it be reasonable to try and go forward with this? Neither of us are very DIY capable so I don't know if us enclosing the area ourselves is a great idea. Additionally, are there other loan options we could look into that don't have a 5.99% interest rate? This seemed pretty high, and I'm wondering if we could try for the 12 month repayment with no interest. That's a *hefty* monthly payment though and it would tighten our budget dramatically. 

I'm sure I'm missing something, so please feel free to ask for more details. In short, both of us would really like to have this done, but we just aren't sure how to make sure it's feasible and not completely stupid.",finance,1652455459
investing,One key component in the economy - and why a major recession might not be imminent,"It’s personal savings rate and its ability to prop up consumer demand. Look at the chart in https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT, you will see that the savings rate is dangerously low from 04-08. Then the bubble popped and nobody is able to spend anymore.

Now looking at what we have now - the savings rate is coming back down from a historically high level but we are still at 6%. This is what the fed referred to as ‘strong household balance sheet’. people still have plenty of money to spare, at least as of now.

So if the fed is not too aggressive after reaching neutral (2%) the savings rate would come down to 4%-5% level for a while, the consumer demand will cool down. If this is the case, we will likely see few quarters of neutral-to-negative GDP growth (so technically a slowdown rather than a full-blown recession, like we have seen in 08, that made millions out of jobs) but no plummeting of GDP, again, because people now have money to spare.",finance,1652455612

Yesterday I found this after doing research about a HYSA's

NEWS: The initial interest rate on new Series I savings bonds is 9.62 percent. You can buy I bonds at that rate through October 2022

First, I thought this is too good to be true, but now I am wondering if I should take advantage of that by depositing 10k right away. I made an account with treasure direct waiting to make a deposit. But I have some doubts regarding this account. I know that the interest rate can change in the future, but my main question is how safe is this I Bonds account when the government or the economy does pretty bad?. Right now the market is declining and we don't now how bad is going to be, but how secure would be your money if the economy crash or the government does pretty bad?. Would the money be like FDIC in a regular bank account if something happens?. Do you recommend this for savings over the HYSA'S, or like me I have HYSA and I am thinking to split the money with IBonds. Does it sounds a good idea?.",finance,1652459930
personalfinance,FSA Annual Limits Question (USA),"Here’s the situation. My current job offers an FSA (not HSA or HRA) with an annual limit of $2550 (even though the federal limit has been increased this year to $2850 I believe). During open enrollment, I elected to go for the maximum $2550. Now, I may be switching jobs soon. 

Let’s say I start my new job July 1 and they also offer the FSA. That means I’ve contributed half of my year’s election to the fsa at the first job at that point, $1275. I’ll have been reimbursed from this FSA for medical expense somewhere around $2000 by the time I leave this job, so that’s a bit of a bonus. 

My question, having received $2000 in reimbursement already, is my limit for the FSA $850 at my new job for the remainder of the year or will it be whatever that employer’s limit is, possibly $2850 or so? Could I elect for another $2000 or so at my new job for the rest of 2022 or does that break the rules of federal tax limits?

Edit: I think I may have found the answer. Does this seem correct?

Updated April 19, 2022
Yes! Your contribution limits (and FSA) are tied to your employer's plan. If you contribute to an FSA through one employer, then leave for another employer and contribute to a new FSA, you can contribute up to the annual limit through your new employer, regardless of how much you contributed through the previous employer.",finance,1652460097

Separately, I have a Roth at another firm. I was going to move it to Vanguard because my ""advisor"" at the other started pushing me to make them a fiduciary but acted like asking questions was somehow threatening.

I opened a couple of Vanguard accounts because I've read good things about Vg. But,

1. I don't know a damn thing about investing. I see people say that Vg offers a more diverse selection of funds than TIAA, but I don't know how anything about that or how to even see those.While I like researching and could really get into this, I won't have time for that for a long while. I just want to get it done and put my $ somewhere it's going to grow and not worry about it.
2. So far TIAA is way easier to use than Vg. I dislike how old-fashioned Vanguard is: constantly having to call on the phone, no online communication, having to print and mail documents. I don't even have a printer or a secure place to print. Frankly I haven't needed to in years. I don't want to print docs with my SSN &amp; accounts at a FedEx! Plus time is money; all of that  takes a lot of time. With TIAA I've been able to do everything simply, fast, online.I'd rather just move everything to TIAA for ease of use. But I'd rather not lose $ on fees long-term.
3. TIAA's fine print says: ""There is no account fee to own a TIAA IRA; however, brokerage  transaction fees may apply. In addition, investors are subject to the underlying funds' portfolio management fees and expenses."" Not sure how that compares to Vanguard.

**Tl;DR:** I don't know anything. TIAA is easier to use. Vanguard is burdensome, but is it that much better for the $?

Bitcoin,"The FED is playing with us, like someone plays with a cat and a string of yarn. We may see further rallies within a short period (ie. 2-3 weeks)","In recent months, Bitcoin price has been effected by the stock market performance, because institutional traders use leverage, so when there's a drop in stocks they need to liquidate BTC positions to free-up cash to cover margin calls.

And I've been watching the FED announcements since November, they've been alternating hot-and-cold, it's something different every few weeks with Jeremy Powell.

They claim there will be multiple interest rate increases this year, the market takes a dump based on the news, and suddenly ""we might have to reconsider the number of rate hikes"", market goes up again.

Even now, the FIRST interest rate hike in many years, and immediately tech stocks plummeted, we're already seeing massive job losses.

And the FED is calling for another rate hike, I think in 3 months? But if the stock market losses keep going, and unemployment numbers hit 9 to 10%, the FED has to cancel the next rate increase, because they have to keep unemployment numbers low as well.

It's a see-saw. They change the strategy from week to week.

But the market reacts instantly to the news, and then gradually balances back, and we see small runs again.

There's a good recent video that explains the details of these macro-economics:

https://youtu.be/DHY8sWt7EOE

I think the takeaway is this...

The FED is creating a perception of Fear and Panic.

But this is only temporarily tightening the trading in the market. 

It almost looks purposeful, like they're trying to get retail investors to sell at a loss, while hedgies swoop in and buy everything at a 35-50% discount.

Then they reverse the FUD, market rebounds, hedgies sell, and cause another FUD dump with lower-lows.

They're just playing with us at this point.

If you really don't need to access the money for 2-3 years, don't sell. And if you have cash, DCA when those -25% -35% intervals are hit, expecting that they will appear.

I don't think the Fear is legitimate, it looks manufactured.

And if you know anything about the options that the FED has these days (hint: no options, they MUST print more money sooner or later, regardless of interest rates), then you know that future Inflation is guaranteed.

vet,Cat uninterested in food/vomiting,"Hi, 

My 10 year old tabby has been getting increasingly pickier about his food options to the point where he's now showing interest in his food but not eating it. He's always seemed like he has a sensitive stomach, vomiting/coughing up hairballs occasionally but has really picked up the vomiting lately. He's been getting checkups regularly and last year had some teeth removed during which they tested him and all values were normal.

He had a stool sample taken about a month ago which was perfectly normal and a blood panel taken this past Wednesday - again perfect with the exception of a slightly elevated pancreas value (5.0-something). Up until today he had been at least accepting treats and plain chicken breast, and keeping them down, but he didn't want any chicken breast or treats this morning. I bought a bunch of new types of kibbles and wet foods this morning, he immediately ate one of the kibbles but threw them up about 5 mins later. 

His vet prescribed an appetite stimulant so I will try that in maybe an hour or so but I'm concerned it's a linear obstruction - he has been known to eat any string he can find, including the bottom linings of furniture - I've proofed the house as much as I can but I don't know what else to do. 

Since he threw up the new kibbles he did poop and it was normal. The vet recommended trying the stimulant in about an hour but I'm so worried. Can a slightly elevated pancreas value cause this? Is it likely an obstruction or something else?

I am currently max'ing out my 401k but am confused as to whether or not i should be putting it in roth or traditional. On the surface yes yes, tax free growth i get it. BUT if you consider the money i am getting pre tax over the $20,500 that can then be put towards other investments the whole thing gets a little hazy

Rough one year example assuming my retirement tax bracket is 24% and my current total state and federal is 37%

**TRADITIONAL** (12.7% of income bi weekly = $856)

So $856 \* 24 contributions = $20,500 max Lets assume my single year contribution doubles 3 times...

20,500

41,000

82,000

164,000

164,000 - 24% tax hit = **$124,640**

**ROTH** (20% of income bi weekly post tax = $856)

Same as above, $856 \* 24 contributions = $20,500 max Lets assume my single year contribution doubles 3 times...

20,500

41,000

82,000

164,000

164,000 - 0% tax hit = **$164,000**

Obviously the ROTH option wins here BUT, BUT, BUT, what about the missed investment opportunity between the 20% vs 12.7% of my income hit?

**Remainder** (7.3% of income bi weekly = $492.3)

$492.3 \* 24 contributions = $11,815 - 37% tax hit to invest post tax = $7,444

Lets say i put that remainder amount directly into a roth IRA through back door and blow the extra $1444 on therapy because i am an obvious over thinker and then that roth IRA doubles 3 times

6,000

12,000

24,000

48,000

48,000 - 0% tax hit = **$48,000**

**IN CONCLUSION**

Saving a whopping 20% of my gross income in the two scenarios would leave me with...

ROTH = **$164,000**

Traditional + Spillover to Roth IRA = **$172,640**

stocks,Warner Bros. Discovery: A bargain?,"WarnerMedia was recently spun into Discovery Inc, creating the world's second largest media company and possibly the most profitable. Instead of generating enthusiasm, it entered into a declining market that is particularly skeptical of media stocks, and the combined companies are now trading at one of their lowest valuations in decades.

&amp;#x200B;

**Media stock slump**

Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Lionsgate, WBD, and AMC have all slumped recently, with some of them (including WBD) trading for P/E's below ten and P/S's below one.

It seems to be largely due to speculation that consumers will cut down on their steaming services and/or cable due to inflation. A possible recession (with -1.4% GDP growth in Q1) may also harm ad sales. Personally, I don't think the change will be too drastic, since cable TV and box office sales have historically been inflation resistant. Both HBO Max and Discovery+ had subscriber growth in Q1, and in their recent earnings call Discovery increased ad revenues in Q1 and say they have continued to grow into Q2.

The Netflix situation has also created pessimism around the streaming business model. They have forecasted a 1.3% decline in subscribers over the first half of the year. 700k of the 2.7m loss were subscribers from Russia. They also had a significant price increase and did terribly on content, increasing spending on Netflix originals by billions but failing to produce breakout hits besides Squid Game. I don't see how this particular situation should affect views on streaming overall.

&amp;#x200B;

**WBD Highlights**

\-WarnerMedia had $35.6b revenue in 2021, and Discovery had $12.2b, for a total of $47.8b. This could go up this year due to rebounding box office revenues.

\-Current market cap is $43.9b. $55b debt means they have an enterprise value in the $90b range. Fortunately Discovery issued $30b in bonds earlier in the year when interest rates were lower.

\-WarnerMedia had about $8b operating income each year over the past 2 years. In the 2 years before the AT&amp;T merger, they had $3.9b and $5.2b net income.  Discovery had $1.1b net income last year.

\-They have estimated $3b+ in cost savings, which a BOA analyst called ""conservative"". This produces a bull case of over $10b in annual profits (which should be the case if media spending doesn't fall dramatically and if they have more hits than misses with their content).

\-Own multiple large studios

\-Produce over 100 shows, more than half for third parties

\-Top 2 at the box office 11 of the past 12 years

\-Number one media company in the US in terms of hours viewed. Having such a large reach across a variety of niches should give them an advantage in ad sales.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management**

AT&amp;T management is not well regarded. They are seen as having completed multiple ill-conceived acquisitions.  CNN+ and the decision to release movies simultaneously on HBO Max in 2020/21 and a 45-day window in 2022 have generally been seen as failures. However, they did invest heavily in assembling a strong content lineup.

David Zaslav and the Discovery management team have completed numerous successful acquisitions, maintaining consistent profitability while quadrupling revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Content**

With over 100 shows in production and over 1000 other movies/shows in their library, there's way to much to list but here are some of the highlights.

Discovery: TLC, HGTV, Food Network, etc. While not really producing ""prestige content"", they have a lot of stuff that is highly bingeable. This is is why Discovery+ generates more revenue on it's $4.99 ad-supported tier than it's $6.99 premium tier, and also has one of the lowest churns in streaming.

Combining Discovery+, HBO Max, Cartoon Network, Turner Sports, and CNN (which will be focused on solidifying its reputation as the world's leading fact-based journalism organization) can create the most varied streaming platform on the market.

DC: They have an upcoming lineup of films that they have put more time and money into than most of their previous releases: League of Super Pets, Black Adam, Shazam 2, Aquaman 2, and the Flash are all coming in the next 13 months. They also have upcoming series such as Peacemaker Season 2, Justice League Dark (directed by JJ Abrams), Green Lantern Corps, Penguin &amp; Arkham series, and Michael B. Jordan's Superman series.

Harry Potter: More films planned

Lord of the Rings: They say they still have exclusive film rights and have an upcoming animated movie (War of the Rohirrim) in pre-production. I'm guessing they'll start making live action films after that, although they're still in mediation with the Saul Zaentz company.

Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon prequel series coming in August. They also have a big-budget The Last of Us series coming.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the world's leading TV show studios, including being the kings of the sitcom genre. Even for shows that air on different networks, they usually retain significant rights. Shows include: Friends, Sienfeld, Full House, Fresh Prince, Family Mattes, Murphy Brown, Ted Lasso, Two and a Half Men, Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon, The Batchelor, Fringe, ER, Person of Interest, etc.

Own the classic MGM &amp; RKO pictures libraries: The Wizard of Oz (remake planned), Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane, etc.

Looney Tunes &amp; Hanna Barbara (Scooby Doo, The Flinstones, The Jetsons, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

Film series in their library include: Dune (part 2 coming), Rush Hour, Lethal Weapon, Austin Powers, Friday the 13th, Mortal Kombat (sequel planned), Gremlins, Nightmare on Elm Street, Bullit (sequel coming, directed by Steven Spielberg), Mad Max (Furiosa prequel coming), The Conjuring, Godzilla/King Kong, Lego movies, Ocean's, and The Matrix.  They plan to have multiple mid-budget remakes/reboots each year on HBO Max.

&amp;#x200B;

Upcoming Games: Hogwarts Legacy, Gotham Knights, Justice League: Kill the Suicide Squad, and Harry Potter: Magic Awakened (mobile game in partnership with NetEase, has already grossed over $200m in Asia and awaiting global release)

&amp;#x200B;

**Big Tech, Antitrust, and the Steaming Wars**

Right now it seems like there are too many competitors in streaming, with Apple and Amazon increasing their spending in addition to Netflix and the legacy media companies. When asked, the leaders at NBC Universal, Paramount, WBD, and Lionsgate have left the door open to merging or at least partnering.

There's also talk of increasing antitrust. If this materializes they may be prevented from merging, but big tech will also probably be prevented from increasing their presence in streaming (FTC head Lina Khan is a big critic of Amazon Prime and big tech in general).

In the most recent earnings call, Zaslav repeatedly emphasized that WBD was the world's greatest ""content production factory"" and the world's ""leader in IP"". He even referred to WBD as ""arms dealers"". He talked about diversified revenue streams but never gave a long-term forecast for HBO max subscribers or boasted about them becoming a leader in streaming. It seemed like he was implying that if the spending wars intensified (presumably if Apple and Amazon continue to increase spending), WBD will focus more on licensing rather than growing their subscriber numbers (in this scenario HBO and Discovery+ will go back to being niche services).",finance,1652469765

I first started back in February or March and I was very happy with Anchor. I never took any loans, I never leveraged on my holdings, and I never exploited the mechanisms. All I did was simply lock my UST and since the first day, I have been buying UST with USDT and depositing them into my Anchor account.

In my opinion, what happened the last few days was not only an attack on the LUNA ecosystem but on the whole crypto space since an event like this has the potential to shake and damaged crypto reputation and push newcomers out - which is terrible for mass adoption.

One thing we can't deny though is that TRUST has been shaken. Are you capable of trusting TFL, LFG, and Do Kwon again? The truth is nobody really knows what happened and there are many theories from a deliberated attack by Blackrock/Citadel to even an exit plan by Do.

At the time of de-pegging, I had around 13,030 UST on Anchor and another 4,000 staked on Binance. Roughly I had 17,000 USD I was saving to make the down payment on my apartment and now it's gone.

I've read many proposals to salvage LUNA in the last few days and in my humble opinion, the best proposal is this one here - [https://agora.terra.money/t/proposal-tiered-repayment-airdrop-usdc-usdt-to-small-ust-holders-on-terra/6471](https://agora.terra.money/t/proposal-tiered-repayment-airdrop-usdc-usdt-to-small-ust-holders-on-terra/6471).  
 

* Outstanding aUST: 8.3 billion
* The top 10 Anchor wallets own 26.824% of all aUST (!!!)
* There are a total of 256k Anchor wallets
* The top 1,000 Anchor wallets own 82.37% of all aUST
* The poorest wallet from the top 1,000 has 955k aUST

&amp;#x200B;

I really believe that saving the smaller holders is the best solution since they account for the vast majority of people yet for the least amount of capital.

If LUNA is able to save the small and deeply impacted people it will regain trust really fast. This is what we need now. Most of the UST holders had less than 20,000 UST in total and a big portion of the accounts had much less than 5,000. Saving and bailing out these people should be priority number one to regain trust.

LUNA has built a tremendous network and ecosystem and I believe it is worth at least a few billion. The community is huge, the dev talent pool is amazing and Terra Station has millions of users worldwide. I imagine it's possible to get a loan (since the interest rates in the US are so low the impact won't be so hard) and save the network, bailout small users, and buy back and burn LUNA.

Of course, in case there are any funds left in LFG reserves or even on TFL accounts, these should be immediately used to rescue the protocol and regain trust.

Do Kwon should also be accounted responsible for everything and his personal net worth should be used as collateral for the loan or, even better, be put at the service of LUNA and its holders.

Do is clearly a filthy rich man - one of the FORBES' 30 under 30 - and he should but his own money to save what he destroyed with his psychopathic behavior and arrogance. (Karma is a bitch, right?).

I have many theories for Do's silence and one of these theories is that he was hiding his assets and taking ownership of the remaining Bitcoin LFG had, dumping LUNA and USDT, and stacking Bitcoin and other cryptos for his own. Of course guys this is only a theory but I can't say a psychopath as he wouldn't do or consider doing it.

**What is my proposal then?**

To regain the trust we need to save the small UST holders immediately. Accounts with up to 5,000 UST prior to the de-peg event should be able to redeem immediately with a 1:1 ratio.

Accounts with 5,001 to 10,000 UST next. As soon as the smaller accounts are saved and rescued these accounts will be able to reclaim, followed by 10,001 to 15,000 and then 15,001 to 30,000 UST.

In addition to this, I propose we give every user an option of a scheduled pay-out and I'm going to use myself as an example.

I had 17,000 UST the moment the event started and I don't want to redeem everything at once. Let's say I agree with a monthly schedule. My UST would be then redeemed at a 1:1 ratio with an early APY equal to the United States Federal Reserve basic interest rates.

Then LUNA burns the redeemed UST and also burns LUNA with the fees generated in the network. If we regain trust the whole ecosystem will regain life and we will be able to burn LUNA and increase its price while working and developing the network and increasing its worth.

Also, if a loan is granted using LUNA's future income as collateral this loan should be used in a 70:30 percent ratio to buy back and burn LUNA and bailout all the small holders.",cryptocurrency,1652471747
Bitcoin,"Robert Kiyosaki of Rich Dad Poor Dad says he'll buy Bitcoin when the 'bottom is in,' which he believes will be around $17,000. Is Buying Bitcoin When the Price Dips the Best time to Buy?","Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, has updated his bitcoin price prediction and perspective. 

On Thursday, Kiyosaki tweeted that bitcoin is collapsing and that he is waiting for the price to drop to $20,000. He explained that he will wait for BTC to test the bottom, which he believes will be around $17,000, before starting to buy. ""The best moments to get money are during crashes,"" he recommended.

The author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad announced in January that he would buy additional bitcoin ""if and when BTC tests $20K.""
The acclaimed author predicted the largest bubble implosion last month. The government, Wall Street, and the Federal Reserve were all referred to as ""thieves"" by him. He also predicted hyperinflation and depression, advising investors to purchase gold, silver, and bitcoin.


I agree with the Rich Dad Poor Dad author has I think Bitcoin's  value is more than just it's market valuation.
The cryptocurrency is innovative and it's is preferable to fiat. Bitcoin is more secure, easily transferable, decentralized. 
 Bitcoin will be an integral part of global institutional finance has we have seen more and government and financial institutions adopt the cryptocurrency. 

Also if one takes a look at the metaverse and the block chain ecosystem which is steadily developing with innovative projects such as Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology, Planet Maya which is powered by champions games is  a decentralized and collaborative online casino which allows developers to build Games around betting, Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses. I think Blockchain technology will revolutionize our civilization just like the internet did which makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more important has the Blockchain ecosystem utilizes cryptocurrencies for transactions. 
 
I think when you really do understand Bitcoin and Blockchain technology and the impact it will have on our society on a global scale it will be silly to sell Bitcoin because of  price fluctuations.",cryptocurrency,1652472392

CryptoCurrency,"What do you hope comes out of this bear market? For me, the biggest one is proof of humanity","For as much as we give grayscale crap, I do like their market analysis. See snip below:

The fallout of UST and LUNA coupled with efforts by the Federal Reserve to slow the economy and tackle inflation may have shaken the confidence of many retail investors and created sizable losses for institutional investors backing the Terra ecosystem. As a result, we believe we’re likely to see a consolidation phase into the larger crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The losses experienced by institutional investors may result in decreased venture funding for new and existing protocol teams, as well as a consolidation of capital around teams building core infrastructure for the ecosystem. 

Historically, these times have been when the most important crypto protocols were developed, such as Ethereum after the Mt. Gox hack of 2014, or MakerDAO and Uniswap after the crypto market crash in 2017. 

Despite an overall bearish sentiment from the market, crypto fundamentals look strong and are continuing to push new highs like the Bitcoin hash rate – a crucial metric in understanding the security of the network.

investing,What the Fed should/could/will do with monetary policy? Let's summarize sentiment.,"Hello FinanceTLDR here again.

By now we should all agree that the Fed is tightening monetary policy. However, there is a lot of disagreement on what the Fed should/could/will do with monetary policy moving forward. And whatever they do end up doing will have huge implications on the overall market.

So today I want to give a quick sampling of all these conflicting opinions to help you make up your own mind about where the Fed is headed.

Let’s start with overall market expectations.

**Overall expectations**

The [Atlanta Fed projects](https://www.atlantafed.org/cenfis/market-probability-tracker) that the market expects a 3% Fed Funds Rate by the end of the year.

**The Fed shouldn’t be raising rates**

Carl Weinberg, High Frequency Economics Chief Economist &amp; Managing Director, went on Bloomberg recently talking about how the current inflation is caused by supply side constraints and not rising demand. This is because of energy prices raising much higher relative to other prices, which is actually deflationary since a lot of money is going into energy prices and less for discretionary consumption.

This creates a growth problem and hammering demand when the supply side is an issue will cause a lot more pain than is necessary. The Fed now should be cutting rates instead to keep investment flowing into alternative energy solutions.

**The Fed can try to raise but won’t get there**

Josh Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and regular CNBC contributor, mentioned in a recent The Compound podcast that he thinks 3% rates (market expectation) by year-end is too high. The Fed will try to raise to that level but something will break in the process and force the Fed to backtrack. This is similar to what happened in 2018 when overnight repo rates blew up forcing the Fed to reverse course and loosen monetary policy again.

**Inflation is a demand side issue, the Fed needs to raise**

Michael Darda, MKM Partners Chief Economist &amp; Macro Strategist, recently went on Bloomberg saying that inflation is actually a demand side issue and the Fed is right in raising rates. His reasoning is that supply side shocks can change the composition of GDP growth but not increase growth, and if we look at how GDP and inflation has overshot the previous trend, it appears demand side is causing about 60-70% of the overshoot. In this case, the Fed is right about raising rates.

Bill Dudley, former NY Fed President, also agrees that this inflation is caused by the demand, but he has a different take. He thinks that inflation is actually largely driven by a tight labor market that is causing real wages to actually fall behind inflation. The Fed therefore needs to cool off the labor market and this will cool off inflation as well. Dudley thinks a 4-5% Fed Funds Rate at year end is more reasonable, and 5-6% rate won’t surprise him.

**Inflation is going to stay elevated. The Fed needs to be more aggressive**

Finally, we have Jeremy Siegel, 

Jeremy Siegel, Professor of Finance at the Wharton School, who recently went on CNBC to say that there is actually a lot of inflation that won’t show up in the CPI index until later (e.g. housing-related inflation) and we’re going to see an elevated CPI index for the next 6 to 9 months. Therefore, the Fed actually needs to be way more aggressive and do a 100 bps hike instead of a 50 bps hike as the next step up.

There’s a lot of conflicting opinions out there on what the Fed should do or will end up doing. Hopefully this is a good enough sampling of some of these opinions and you’ve found it useful in making your own mind up on what the Fed should/could/will do.",finance,1652477369

2) Would it make sense for me to transfer the entirety of the loan onto a 0% APR Balance Transfer credit card? The ones I've looked at so far have like 18-21 month 0% APR on balance transfers, but they have 3-5% balance transfer fees.

Given that blockchain will become the online purchase standard, why isn't this sub paying more attention to what may be the first consolidation of interbank communication languages? The Fed seems on board according to wiki, and SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is backing the standard.

# **Investors could get a reprieve from vicious stock sell-off in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/13/investors-could-get-a-reprieve-from-vicious-stock-sell-off-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors could get a reprieve in the week ahead from the vicious selling cycle that has gripped the stock market since late March.
*****
&gt; Stocks bounced off of Thursday’s washout lows and were set to exit the week with reduced losses after Friday’s rally. Buyers on Friday hunted for bargains among small caps, biotechnology names, the Arkk Innovation ETF and other growth names that were hardest hit.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 jumped back above the key 4,000 level Friday, after touching 3,858 on Thursday — near the 3,800 to 3,850 area that chart analysts have been targeting for a bottom. But while it seems like the market could bounce temporarily, market technicians say that zone will likely be tested again later on.
*****
&gt; “Does that mean the lows of the year are in? Probably not, but it could create an oversold bounce back to retest the 4,100 or 4,200 level in the S&amp;P 500,” said T3Live.com’s Scott Redler, who follows the market’s short-term technicals. “In bull markets, you get weeks when you pull in. In bear markets, you get oversold bounces.
*****
&gt; Redler said he expects traders to try to sell the rally. On Friday, the Nasdaq surged 3.8% though it was down 2.8% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.5% but down 2.1% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 ended Friday at 4,023, up 2.4%, but down the same amount for the week.
*****
&gt; “It has the ingredients for an oversold bounce that might last more than a week. I think this bounce is going to be led by all the oversold names that are down 70% to 80% from their highs,” he said. “It doesn’t mean you can blindly buy. Not everything is going to be created equally in this bounce.”
*****
&gt; Redler said the fact that the Federal Reserve does not meet for a few weeks could add some support to stocks. Markets have been nervous that the Fed will raise interest rates too quickly and choke the economic recovery as it tries to snuff out hot inflation.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, investors will continue to look for clues on the course of the central bank’s interest rate hiking path in both economic reports and comments from Fed officials.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to speak at a Wall Street Journal conference Tuesday afternoon. For now, the market expects a half-point interest rate hike at the June meeting and another in July, with possibly a third in September. The central bank raised its fed funds target rate by a half point this month, after a quarter point hike in March.
*****
&gt; The health of the consumer will be a major focus in the coming week. The economic calendar includes April retail sales and also a look at the housing sector, with the National Association of Home Builders’ survey; both reports are set for release Tuesday, with housing starts coming on Wednesday and existing home sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; Walmart, Home Depot and Target are set to report earnings next week, and of these big chain stores could provide good insight into the impact of inflation on consumer spending and attitudes.
*****
&gt; # Nearly a bear market
&gt; Perhaps the most telling thing for investors in the coming week will be just how the stock market trades after its effort to bounce back Friday.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500′s dip to 3,858.87 on Thursday took the index to a decline of 19.55% from its high on an intraday basis — very close to the official 20% decline for a bear market.
*****
&gt; The unrelenting run up in bond yields also slowed, after the 10-year yield peaked this past week at 3.2%. The 10-year was at 2.93% Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think what’s most encouraging to me is the rate rout has stopped. All year long, short-term yields have been pushing up the 10-year yields,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He noted that inflation expectations in the bond market have also backed down, and the reduced pressure from the rates market could help stocks rally. Yields move opposite prices in the bond market.
*****
&gt; Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton said the slowdown in the 10-year yield’s climb is important. For the broader economy, the 10-year’s run from about 1.5% at the start of the year has already had a impact on housing, since home mortgages are influenced by it.
*****
&gt; For stocks, technology and growth names have been most impacted by higher Treasury yields. That’s because higher rates make money more expensive, and cheap money is the fuel for stocks with high valuations.
*****
&gt; “I think 10-year yields are just going to be stalled in here,” said Stockton, noting her view is purely based on chart analysis. “Such a steep uptrend is unsustainable. ... We believe there’s going to be consolidation in Treasury yields and in the dollar.” She said the support for the 10-year is at 2.55% and upward resistance is at 3.25%.
*****
&gt; Paulsen noted that much speculation has been wrung from high-fliers and big cap tech. “Look at the FANG stocks going from 14% of market cap to 9%. A lot of the tech bleed is done,” he said.
*****
&gt; Investors were also watching Apple this past week, after it broke support at $150. The stock has an outsized influence on the market, since it is the biggest U.S. company by market cap and is part of the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq.
*****
&gt; Apple stock fell just below Stockton’s target of $139 on Thursday but recovered Friday, to close at $147.11 per share.
*****
&gt; Stockton said her chart analysis is signaling the market could see around two weeks of stabilization, either with a bounce or sideways move. “It’s not a buy signal. I’m not recommending people buy.”
*****
&gt; There could be an oversold bounce, “and we generally plan to use that oversold bounce to reduce exposure,” she said.
*****
&gt; Her downside S&amp;P 500 target had been 3,815, and she said it is still in play. “We have to assume it will be a retest,” Stockton said. “The retest has a higher chance of yielding a breakdown because the momentum is still to the downside.”

&gt; # Stocks Near Pre-COVID Highs - 5/13/22

&gt; Two days ago, we outlined the percentage of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector that were below their pre-COVID highs to show that many of the stocks that surged due to pandemic effects have significantly fallen off, netting long-term holders a negative return since the onslaught of the pandemic. Over the course of the next few weeks, we will be outlining the S&amp;P 500 stocks that are breaking below/above their pre-COVID highs, as we did yesterday. Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 fell by 10 basis points to close at a new 52-week low, but the index is still up over 15% relative to pre-COVID highs. As of yesterday's close, 40.4% of S&amp;P 500 stocks were below this critical level, an 80 basis point improvement relative to the close on 5/11. 71.4% of utilities and 66.7% of communication services stocks were below their respective pre-COVID highs as of yesterday's close. On the other hand, only 18.5% and 23.8% of S&amp;P 500 stocks in the materials and energy sectors were below their respective highs between the start of 2019 and the end of February 2020. Additionally, 7.8% of S&amp;P 500 stocks were between 0-5% above their pre-COVID highs (39 members).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/SP-500-Stocks-Under-Pre-COVID-Highs-051322.png))**

&gt; Only one stock crossed below its pre-COVID highs for the first time since breaking above that level: MGM Resorts (MGM). However, the stock gapped higher by over 3% today, thus returning above this level. The weak performance as of late is due to a variety of factors including China's zero-Covid policy, the broader market drawdown, and a weak reaction to the latest earnings report, even though the company beat on the top and bottom line.

&gt; # Oh Great, Here Comes Friday The 13th

&gt; This is one of the worst starts to a year ever and now we have to worry about Friday the 13th. That’s right, tomorrow, May 13, will be the first Friday the 13th since August 2021. For most people, this is just another day, unless you suffer from triskaidekaphobia—the fear of the number 13. A fear of the actual day of Friday the 13th is called paraskevidekatriaphobia or friggatriskaidekaphobia.

&gt; “Fortunately, the unlucky nature of Friday the 13th hasn’t tripped up U.S. stocks recently. In fact, the past four times Friday the 13th came around saw gains,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now the bad news: May hasn’t been kind to this day, down the past three times.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index has struggled some when a Friday the 13th takes place during the month of May.

&gt; 2022 has been bad pretty much all around, but it turns out Wednesday is once again the best day of the week, and it really isn’t even close, although it didn’t hold true yesterday.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Blog-chart-5.12.22.png))**

&gt; If it feels like this year hasn’t had many green days, that is probably because that is quite true. In fact, in 2022 only 43.3% (39 out of 90) of the days have seen the S&amp;P 500 Index finish higher. The good news is we expect this number to mean-revert and we’ll see more green days before 2022 is all said and done.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Blog-5.12.22-1.png))**

&gt; As rough as this year has been, how does this correction stack up with other corrections? Currently, the S&amp;P 500 is down 18% from the January 2 peak and it has been 128 days. Looking at all the corrections since 1980 shows the average one ends at about 88 days, so this correction is getting long in the tooth and could be nearing its conclusion. Additionally, the good news is a year off the correction lows, stocks have been higher 22 out of 24 times with an average gain of 23.0%.

&gt; # Sentiment Just Like Bear Markets

&gt; The past week may have seen the S&amp;P 500 and other major US indices breach to fresh lows on steep declines that are nearing bear market territory, but the AAII sentiment survey has not fallen to its own lows as might have been expected. Bullish sentiment fell back below 25% this week but is still several percentage points above the lows in the teens from only a few weeks prior.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/051222-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Historically, when the S&amp;P 500 has hit 52-week lows as it has in the past week, bullish sentiment has usually been even higher with an average reading of 29.15%. The chart below shows the levels of bearish, bullish, and neutral sentiment in the AAII survey at the time the S&amp;P 500 first traded into bear market territory (down 20% from a prior peak) for each bear market since the survey began in 1987. At 24.3% now, the current reading of bullish sentiment is on the low side compared to prior bear markets. The only two bear markets where bullish sentiment was lower were July 2008 and February 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/051222-AAII-BullBear-Bear-1.png))**

&gt; Although bullish sentiment declined, bearish sentiment also pulled back below 50% for the first time since the week of April 20th. Even with the decline, though, bearish sentiment remains at a historically high level.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/051222-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Given the moves, the bull-bear spread was higher for a second week in a row after it had reached the lowest level since March 2009 two weeks ago. Again, in spite of those improvements, the current level remains in the bottom 5% of all weeks on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/051222-AAII-BullBear.png))**

&gt; The year is already a third over, and sentiment has found no respite after multiple months of declines in equity prices. In fact, bullish sentiment has not seen a single week with a reading above its historical average, and there has only been one such week for bearish sentiment. In the charts below, we show the average bullish and bearish sentiment reading by year since the start of the survey in 1987. While there's still a lot of time left for things to change, with an average bullish sentiment reading of just 24.42% at this point in 2022, this year ranks as the worst year for bullish sentiment in the history of the survey (since 1987), although 1988 and 1990 have come close with average readings of around 27%. Meanwhile, the average reading on bearish sentiment has been 44.3% this year. 2008 is the only other year with a higher average reading at 45%. In other words, it is hard to find a comparable year since the late 1980s where optimism has been this low and pessimism this high.

&gt; # Update: 1970 Redux vs. 1962 &amp; 1974?

&gt; Last week I illustrated how eerily close 2022 is tracking 1970. This disturbing comparison is not abating. Two other comparable bear market years have also come to light. 1962 and 1974: both midterm years with similar chart patterns.

&gt; 1962 had the Cold War machinations and the Cuban Missile Crisis, but rates, inflation and oil prices were nothing like 2022. 1974 on the other hand had it all. Q1 GDP was negative, inflation surged, Oil Crisis and war in the Mideast.

&gt; 1960 was removed since it held the March low until September and was an election year. We also looked at 1969 and 1994 which have some similarities and have been bandied about over the transom. But 1969 was not down in April and flat the first four months. Though 1994 was a midterm year it was flat not down like 2022 with a low in March.

&gt; We still expect a classic midterm bottom over the next several months. Where it bottoms is anyone’s guess. We have ours. But we are reminded of an old sign we used to have in the office about picking downside targets. It said one thing, don’t do it.

personalfinance,How does the interest rate work on overbalances?,"Unfortunately, I received an overbalance letter from the Michigan UIA about overbalances. It says I have an overbalance principal of $25,554. It says ""interest will be charged on the principal amount at a rate of 1.0% per month. Interest is computed daily.""

I'm not sure how this interest rate works. Does it mean the interest is charged 1% each month on only the $25,554? (Interest = 25,554 \* 1% each month) Or does it mean that each month, interest is charged on the overall balance? (Interest = \[overall balance\] \* 1% each month).

And does it mean that the 1% is distributed across each day of the month?",finance,1652487503

btc,"Tether, for the first time ever has burned a significant amount of Tether. 5 billion in total. The end of what has been build up since 2016 might be near.","We all know Tether is pure fraud. However nobody really knows how many reserves they have, if those are in crypto or in cash or in whatever.

They are a black box. 

This 5 billion, is it them pretending to cashing out a whale?

Are THEY cashing out themselves?

Did they really just redeem 5 billion Tether for 5 billion dollars?

Nobody knows ... well somebody does ... but it's not me or you. 

We all know that one day Tether will die.

It's very possible that it will happen now.

Right now after these massive crashes, everybody is expecting a recovery.

But if the fed announces they are touching interest rates again or if Europe and the USA come out with strict regulation on stablecoins.

This might spook the stablecoin system. When there is panic amongst the whales, the entire cryptocurrency system will follow luna in absolutely no time.

It will be unlike anything the world has ever seen. 

This is the best thing ever for P2P cash cause it will be the great reset after which everybody loses almost everything.

And BCH can start over from basically zero, trying to find adoption. 

But in the process the price of BCH will dip and dip and dip and dip and dip.

If there are cryptocurrencies that survives such a reset it will be only three. Ethereum, monero and Bitcoin Cash.

Sure, Bitcoin will look to the be the first recovering. But then people will be like: wait a minute, this stuff has no utility why does it have value?

The world post Tether will be radically different.

One way of looking at the insane increase of stablecoins the last 2 years is the following.

If you believe the prices of cryptocurrencies will go up, you don't put your money in stablecoins.

So that means the more stable coins there are and the more money in those stablecoins the more people bet on the prices of crypto going down, not up. 

BUSD, USDC, DAI .... they should survive.

And once Tether is gone, the system will be much fairer for Ethereum, monero and Bitcoin Cash.

If this reset happens it's pretty much a given that Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in marketcap, because of it's utility. 

Because of all the stablecoins and tokens on Ethereum it's more economic resilient then Bitcoin.

Bitcoin only has one thing going for it. The high price and the believe that the price will go even higher.

Something happens to Tether that causes the right amount of panic and that Bitcoin believe melts like snow when the sun comes up.

And then Bitcoin has nothing left. 

I could see all of this play out in just 3 weeks. 

Luna went to zero in 3 days. 99,9% of crypto could go to zero in just 3 weeks. 

And even if you would short, you would most likely still lose because of how Tether has infected every single part of the ecosystem.

Luna went down in just 3 days. The moon went blood red. Maybe it's a sign. And everybody is incredibly nervous right now, and this makes for the perfect possible panic.",cryptocurrency,1652506855
Bitcoin,Why am I still buying bitcoin?,"Maybe you’ve been in the space for 10 years. Maybe you joined last year maybe you’re freaking out.

Why am I still buying bitcoin?

A bit about me, I’m 38, American, and half my net worth is in crypto and the other half is in real estate. Of my crypto, 60% is bitcoin. It will never go below that number either. 50% of additional savings go to bitcoin.

In 2009 houses plunged. And when the pain was too much, someone gave up and someone bought. And then they plunged further, and in 2010 that same buyer who bought... bought another house.

The United States government has no way to pay off his debt. We run on deficit spending. 

The DXY is 104, The stock market is very shaky, we’re facing a potential world wide recession, and Bitcoin is 29K. Five years ago as a bitcoin approached 10 K people were maniacal and got closer to 15 K people thought they were the new kings. The good investments are things that you don’t touch for five years. And the best Ones are those that you don’t touch for 10 years.

Ask yourself this direct question: do you see the United States and the world having more or less debt due to demographics and technology in 10 years? In a world soaked in debt, how can interest rates actually go up? What has the trend been...Can the trends actually be reversed?

Unlike real estate, which has a slow growing percentage of potential buyers a.k.a. population growth, bitcoin has an exponential group of adopters.

When the next stimulus comes, as it has to come because of a slowing economy, I wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin well over 200k. And I wouldn’t be surprised for the same people who never bought houses in the last 10 years to continue to say bubble.",cryptocurrency,1652511483

CryptoCurrency,What to do next in this market? Long.,"Mods took down original post because of the coin mentioned. Here it is again.

As some of you know, this past year has been an incredibly successful year in terms of trading for me. 3 fully realized short trades over the past one and a half months on Luna with 50%+ profit on each have increased my playable stack to comfortable levels. Now I am able to experience first-hand how much easier it is to play the game (and win) with more capital. So what's the next move? First, a quick recap of the sentiment.


Russia is still balls deep in Ukraine, inflation is high, Fed will continue to hike up interest rates, and as icing on the cake, a top 10 coin and its top 10 stablecoin have simultaneously imploded. Talk about a toxic environment. Needless to say, this has driven prices of BTC and coins all across the board down. What's a person to do?


For those of you who don’t margin trade, and you’re sitting on the sidelines to get in, I’d go ahead and throw half your stack into BTC, Eth, and/or a favorite alt now. The general sentiment, even with today's macro, is that prices will more likely go up in the future than down. For me, I margin trade, and I’ve converted all of my playable stack of USDT into BTC. I still have fiat on a limit order at 22k just in case. 


I have no problem admitting that I love to trade. So I will disclose that I also opened a long position on ADA @ $0.67. I know, not a great entry. I tend to jump the gun a little too early. But it’s low leverage, and I’ve laddered in more buy orders, so I think I’m safe. My desired exit is between $1-1.20, which to me is a realistic and lucrative goal. So why ADA?


1) It’s a top 10 alt that’s been around for quite a long time compared to others. It had its hype moment in the past, but it seems to be chugging along. 2) People are going to be looking for a reliable (comparably) alt and try to ride a recovery wave back up. One of the things they’ll be looking for is positive potential, and ADA’s chart looks like it’s ripe for a comeback. 3) Vasil hardfork at the end of June, Basho coming within months, among others. 4) Not a lot of hype around it, but no real bad press either. Yes, some people don’t like Charles Hoskinson, but aside from that, no big red flags that I’ve seen.


As always, different viewpoints and analyses are welcome. If I see that I’ve made a mistake in my position, I’m willing to exit it. In the case of this ADA long, I’m not as sure about it as my Luna shorts. I haven’t taken a long position in years. I just think that the opportunity is there right now.",cryptocurrency,1652521378
personalfinance,What are the pros and cons of using additional funds for a mortgage or using them in a 401k post-match?,"Hey Everyone,

I'm trying to plan ahead for buying a home within the year and I'm looking into whether it would be better to pay my mortgage off sooner or whether it is better to use the tax advantages of a 401k account. 

Considering the interest rates for the mortgage would be something like 4.5-5%, whereas the stock market averages 7% annual growth. Contributing to a 401k is tax-deductible, and the interest on the home loan is tax-deductible. Does this mean it's better to put additional money into a 401k until I reach the annual limit for the tax advantages? This is assuming I have already contributed enough to the 401k to reach the company match already.

personalfinance,We are set to close on June 3. Interest rate is 5.125 but apr is 6.409. Am I getting screwed. Should I consider lender change? FHA 3.5% down.,"We got in touch with this lender because our state department of education had them on a list of lenders approved to work with a teacher down payment grant. We didn’t qualify but they were friendly and responsive. 

Then we found a house and made an offer so we asked for terms. They said 30 year fixed at 5.125. So I looked around and it seemed pretty reasonable. As I was just signing into send them some documentation I clicked on a tab that said loan info that I hadn’t seen yet. 

It pointed out that the APR was 6.409. I started looking up apr and that seems like a huge gap between the interest rate based on what I am now reading. 

I think we can get the closing moved back a little if needed. 

The loan is fha with 3.5% down and I tax because the PMI that could cause a higher APR.

CryptoCurrency,Can we talk about the fed and the fact they are about to eradicate its own fiat?,[removed],cryptocurrency,1652526658
CryptoCurrency,"This may be a shot in the dark, but some hope may remain","I first would like to send my condolences to the members of the Terra community that were heavily affected by the current state of Luna and UST. I knew the power of the ecosystem but only had little financial exposure to it at the time of this event. To public knowledge, there is a ""Terra recovery plan"" in place but the stark reality of it is any proper recovery plan would require a fork of the native coin; essentially abandoning the Luna/UST algorithmic capabilities for a safer approach such as 1:1 fiat backing or by providing an over collateralized stablecoin such as Dai. Unfortunately, that leaves Luna and UST sister ships destined to sink.

All that being said I believe there is a plan that may help even just a few people in the short term. If you are convinced Luna and UST will inevitably reach zero and you have the capabilities to short on your trading platform of choice then try and short the two. At the time of posting, I was monitoring the price of Luna and saw it had incredible buying pressure leading me to believe 1. New people with less exposure are buying Luna assuming it will return to a reasonable state while simultaneously being blissfully unaware of the ripples it left across the broad crypto space currently and for years to come and 2. The multiple bitcoin reserves deployed by the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) are still providing some liquidity to allow time for people to get out. I know of and also agree with the sentiment that the bitcoin reserves weren't enough to save UST, but that is evident in the price of UST never reestablishing its 1$ peg. So I believe it isn't truly over to make a profit until UST reaches zero and that is due to the 1:1 burning mechanism of Luna and UST. 

I know I suggested in the aforementioned paragraph trying to scrape profits off of new people entering the market, which I believe is a predatory practice and shouldn't be a part of any financial space. But on the contrary, I believe everyone should do their  research before buying anything such as securities, technology, housing, etc. but especially with something as volatile as Cryptocurrencies. I wanted to ape myself when I was checking prices and saw Luna surging 500% overnight and wanted to go long thinking that its price was going to recover and that I would be able to recoup some losses due to my previous exposure and I even went as far as entering a long position myself betting on price recovery, but that future is unrealistic without a hard fork due to Luna's tokenomics while simultaneously being the mindset of aforementioned new buyers exposed to the *flashy* price believing Luna will return to ATHs and it's their rocket to the moon. So I proposed the idea to short the tokens instead, even though it won't make you rich I believe it's an easy-to-manage alternative to watching your investments fully deplete to 0. I acknowledged there is more than one way to make money off these tokens at this point and I wish to motivate during this time because in times of great volatility there are trade opportunities to be made but whichever solution you choose fully commit to it. There is more than plenty of liquidity left in the ecosystem to produce enough profit to help the ones most affected because for the individuals who lost everything 50$ is a meal, transportation for aid, or even a room to sleep in. 

I say everything with a grave tone because this is a serious event affecting multiple communities and all this happened on top of market correction and liquidations overall financial sectors as well as unmanaged inflation and raised interest rates on the USD. In my personal life, I recently lost my aunt, someone who stepped in for me after the passing of my mother only a couple of months prior. I am also affected by general loss in markets the same way you are, but as I try to hold my head high and I write this to try and shine a light in the dark for people who have lost hope because their lives drastically changed in less than a week due to the collapse of Luna/UST. So please DYOR, try and avoid unnecessary FUD, and check on friends and family because a warm gesture can go a long way. Once again I am sorry to the ones affected and I wish you all the best of luck. 

Edit1 tldr; Sorry to anyone affected buy the crash, but there is some hope. DYOR and take advantage of this volatility and try to lift each other up as true fate of Terra is still up in the air.
 
Additional thoughts and points to consider

1. Despite the current price of Luna/UST, the underlying value of the Terra ecosystem is high due to the amazing protocols native to their blockchain.
2. Protocols primarily using UST reserves such as Anchor and Mirror could switch to another stablecoin, but would require development time for proper deployment. 
3. There are plans in motion to recover the ecosystem, but understand those plans are tentative and will require time and bonus outside resources for a ""true recovery"" to take place.
4. Any token or protocol integrated with Luna or UST will see incredible volatility until recovery and or death. There is a lot of money moving back and forth so be careful in the Terra ecosystem.
5. I'm just some guy

This resulted in an unprecedented federal intervention to rescue banks and restore confidence in the finance sector. Bitcoin paper was released, and the era of crypto began.

Characteristics of crypto are way more different than the legacy financial system. Your wallet, the primitive part of the system, doesn’t care about your religion or skin color; if we speak more specifically about Europe, It doesn’t care about where you come from. All it matters is your wallet. (I must say this is a fucking great invention ever). I still think it has a great potential to push our civilization further.

On the other hand, crypto is not a regulated area. The Crypto ecosystem has bad guys and good guys, and as of now, we don’t have police in place. The downside of having non-regulation is those bad guys can just get away with it. As will happen with Luna’s Foundation, we will likely not see any police investigating this case.

## [Having regulation or no regulation?](https://www.worldofcrypto.io/blog/we-should-let-luna-die#having-regulation-or-no-regulation)

To answer this question, we should be looking at the legacy financial system where bankers have their 9-5 jobs and do repetitive things all day long without any change. Everything is redundant, formalized, and regulated. We can’t expect any innovation coming out of this vicious cycle, right? We need people to think outside of the box.

I remembered the first Bitcoin crash in 2013. There were no stable coins, and it is now 2022. We have many stable coins now, and we need to keep innovating. Please look at where we are in defi.

## [Hard forking a PoS chain is the same as a central banker’s wet dream.](https://www.worldofcrypto.io/blog/we-should-let-luna-die#hard-forking-a-pos-chain-is-the-same-as-a-central-banker%E2%80%99s-wet-dream.)

I can tell you what will happen in the next crisis. Central bankers will print money again. The term might not be “printing money,” but I think it will sound so fabulous that you will think this time is different, but in the end, they will print money again because they are addicted. I believe this is the same as when you feel it is time to hard fork a pos chain. This could be addictive and dangerous. This could kill innovation in the crypto space. Instead of the hard fork and saving Luna, we need to rethink **a new stable coin resistant to bank runs.**

retirement,Aren't individual bonds much better than bond funds?,"It is commonly recommended that people just invest in a bond fund like Vanguard's Total Market Bond Fund, instead of investing in individual bonds. I suppose the reason is that a total market bond fund diversifies across all sectors and duration.

But the fundamental flaw that I see in a bond fund is that you don't get your principal back. Instead, you just seem to lose a percentage of your principal. It seems like holding pure cash is better than investing in a bond fund.

For example, Vanguard's Total Market Bond Fund is down over 10% in the last year, down 7% in the last 5 years, and down 2% since 2001. 

You might blame that on rising interest rates. But Vanguard's Ultra Short Term Bond Fund (which is much less sensitive to interest rate increases due to having a short term duration) is still down 1% in the last 5 years.

Wouldn't it be much better to just buy individual bonds? If you hold them to maturity, you get your principal back.

personalfinance,Is paying with cash almost always better than credit/financing?,"Suppose I want to buy a $20k car and I am able to afford that with cash available. Why not just pay for it then and there? On the other hand, when you buy on credit/financing, you end up paying more than what the car is worth due to interest rates, but for what? I see the point of credit/financing/loans is to *buy things you can't afford at the moment, but will pay back later, or over time in increments,* but if you have the cash to buy an item at that moment, then why not buy with cash? For example, if a car is worth $20k, and you finance it with 2.5% APR over 60 months, then you're paying  $1,394 on interest. You can use that grand on something else, like a vacation. Also, if you are unable to pay the loan later in life due to financial issues, then they'll seize the car.

Some pitfalls to this idea:

\- It may be better to save that cash for emergency situations, unexpected bills, etc.

\- You won't build your credit history, which means high interest rates on loans, or loans refused, etc.

\- Nowadays, you'll get ""cash back"" on purchases with credit cards, but not for large purchases like cars.

personalfinance,"My first Salaried job offer with relocation, but no savings to move prior to start date! Should I get a pay-day or personal loan to help?","For context my credit score is a solid 560, I have no savings, I am over 100k in debt (multiple fed student loans, 1 private student loan, a car loan and 2 maxed out credit cards ($2k and an $8k on a line I share with my mother)).  I should've joined this sub exactly 8 years ago. I honestly never thought I'd live to be this age, so I am still actively trying to teach myself how to plan for a future.

I recently was offered a new position at $75k, over double my current income, starting June 6th. This is the break that I've been hoping for, as it is my first real chance at financial independence. They also offered a $10k new hire bonus which substitutes a relocation package that I didn't qualify for based on distance. However the terms of this were unclear and I don't think I will be receiving this bonus until after Day 1 at the new job. It will be a 3 hour drive from where I currently live, and I will be WFH Mondays and Fridays after everyone phases back in office (around mid June). I'm assuming I'll be expected in office by June 27th.

Our current lease is up June 30th; my mom will be moving across the country, my brother is moving to a neighboring city, and I am in the process of finding a new apt. I was supposed to go to a showing today with my mom and brother, however at the last moment my mother advised I move in with my brother until I receive my first paycheck, then move again into my own place afterwards.

I figured because I'll need an at-home office, it would be best to move to the new city before June 6th, get settled into my new place with furniture and a work station, so I won't have any added anxiety as I'm starting my new job. Additionally, they will need a local address to send all of the WFH tech and office furniture, which they will be paying for.

From my POV, my mom's plan is the most anxiety inducing and economically wasteful, as I'll need to hire movers twice, and there's no telling whether the apartments that are currently available will be available by the time I get my first check. Additionally, what if I'm asked to begin in office sooner than I anticipate, and I am still living 2 hours away?

Because I have no money or credit line set aside for initial expenses, I figure my only option is to apply for a high interest loan to cover first month's rent and the security deposit. I still have a check and a half coming from my current job, which will only really be enough to cover gas, food, bills, and movers, until I get my first check from my new employer.

Please help, I don't know where to go from here. I can only think to get a loan and pay it off in a few months after receiving the income from my new employer. TIA.

stocks,Why Inflation Has Most Likely Peaked according to this BLS Analyst: Joseph Politano,"I wanted to highlight a superb Substack [blog post](https://apricitas.substack.com/p/peak-inflation?s=w) by Joseph Politano, an analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I'm going to briefly summarize the article and pepper in my own graphs and commentary, but as always, *please read and support* his work. His blog is called [""Apricitas Economics,""](https://apricitas.substack.com/); his [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/josephpolitano) is also full of excellent insights.


**Point 1:** Annualized prices depend heavily on the 'base' effect, i.e., what happened at the start of the period going back 12 months. He writes,

&gt; ""April, May, and June of 2021 had the fastest pace of core CPI growth in nearly 50 years thanks to a spectacular increase in used vehicle and other durable goods prices.""

Because those spectacular increases will exit the window of calculations for annual inflation, there will necessarily be a reduction in measured inflation (all else held equal). This isn't a guess as much as a mathematical consequence. See [Graph 1](https://i.imgur.com/5ECRfDE.png) here from his article.

**Point 2:** The limited Fed tightening and communications have already tightened financial conditions. Proof: [Graph 2](https://i.imgur.com/E1q0GAT.png) depicting the Piper-Sandler index, [Graph 3](https://i.imgur.com/c0OEJXh.png) of 30 year fixed mortgages, and [Graph 4](https://i.imgur.com/72pvlqK.png) from Joseph's article of the Chicago Fed's measure of financial tightness.

**Point 3:** Bond markets are swiftly pricing in dampening inflation (relative to their previous estimates). See [Graph 5](https://i.imgur.com/euetX2R.png) of 5 Year, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation rate and [Graph 6](https://i.imgur.com/YO7WBuw.png) the 10 Year Break-even. The 5 Year Break-even is also falling. I explain more in my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uonvmr/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_may/i8grf60/) what these mean and provide some additional sources. [Here is Joseph's plot, Graph 7](https://i.imgur.com/HaSJSvo.png).

**Point 4**: This is really an extension of Point 1, but the massive increases in used car prices has slowed down dramatically. See [Graph 8](https://i.imgur.com/wZjFoE4.png).

Thus, inflation will remain elevated for a few months, but the extraordinary factors in the spring of 2021 will no longer be represented in upcoming annual calculations of inflation. Further, the Fed is now finally walking the walk. You can argue that 0.5% increases in the interest rate are minuscule historically, but Graph 3 through 7 show that the market is taking it seriously and tightening on its own (e.g., 30 year fixed mortgage rate hitting 5.6%). The Federal Funds Rate and QT doesn't need to have a simple, linear relationship with actual financial conditions.  

The caveat is that we still have upcoming issues with the supply chain, such as in the [diesel](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uklg1n/forget_gasoline_diesel_is_even_more_important_to/) sector, but there have been meaningful improvements in [trucking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ueoqvn/supply_chains_recovering_auto_inventory_with/) and [shipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u5ujf3/wsj_shipping_stocks_will_sink_as_us_consumers/), as I wrote about in my previous posts. But I believe the other factors mentioned imply that inflation has peaked, as Joseph more convincingly argues.

Whatever you believe about the Fed's past actions, they leave me reasonably bullish for say 3 months from now. What do you think?

EDIT: To avoid the dozens of future comments about it: nowhere in this post or article is it claimed that inflation is going to be at 2-3% in a month, gas prices are back to normal, oil is literally shooting up from the ground all around us, it was all transitory, Fed was right all along, the CIA did nothing wrong, etc.

personalfinance,Unsolicited letter from “negotiations department” turns out to be so shady,"I’ve got five credit cards with about $20k in debt across all of them. Not good but I’ve recently turned a corner — started budgeting and worked with a verified non-profit that offers Debt Management Program (long story but basically they take cc accounts, negotiate with the bank for a lower interest rate, and then at the end of the program the cc is closed/dead. So like…yeah I loose one of my oldest credit accounts with great payment history but also my interest rate gets cut WAYYY down from here out)

Anyways, cut to today I open a letter. Black and white, just says NEGOTIATIONS DEPARTMENT at the top. It is designed to look intense, to look intimidating. It’s designed to catch people who are afraid that their accounts are going to fall behind or are already behind. 

I knew I didn’t need whatever service they were offering, but I figured I would call to see what gross corporate overlord was getting in my business this time. Turns out they are called “Start New Financial” which is like…ew, such a gentle name for such a predatory company. I told the guy who answered that I don’t need their help but that they seemed shady to not even mention the name of their company anywhere on the mailing. Y’all can get my home address and debt profile but you can’t manage to put letterhead or your company name ANYWHERE including in the fine print!? Tell me you are a scam without actually telling me you are a scam. 

It makes me mad because I happen to have a small amount of knowledge in this area, a relatively good salary, and because I’ve been to a lot of therapy lol so I don’t have as hard of a time standing up to aggressive/manipulative BS as I used to…but I know that not everyone is in the same position I’m in and so I assume these predatory tactics are working on some very vulnerable people.

I've been a salaried IT worker/manager for almost 25 years.  My customer (who coincidentally was my employer up until 2011 when my company spun the IT Services division out and sold to another company) wants to bring me back on board.  They're working on transitioning from my company for IT services to another company.  They know I know their shit inside and out.  Catch here is, they want me to come on as a independent contractor, not an employee, and I have no idea how that works (see aforementioned, been salaried for 25 years note).  I don't even know how to negotiate for this, but I'm open to talking with them.  Some thoughts that are in my brain:

* compensation - I need to figure out what my current take home is, add some amount (I'm aiming for 15-20%) and then look at covering all my extra/new costs
* taxes - ugh, I'd be responsible now for my own local, state (PA) and federal taxes.  I'm reading I would need to pay quarterly estimates and it's real, real bad if you underpay these?  Do I need to pay things like unemployment, medicare, social security, etc?  
* 401K - yeah, I'd get nothing there.  I have a well established 401K with my current company (that's moved with me every time I was transferred bought/sold), I guess I could call Voya and see if I can leave it there and personally contribute to it?  If not, I guess I need to find a place to roll it?  I'm fully vested.  Part of the compensation loss will be the loss of my employer match.  I think it's 50% of the first 5/6%.  Problem is, a few years back my company stopped matching with every paycheck and now sends the match to Voya after the first paycheck in January, assuming you were employed as of December 31st.  So if I leave mid-year, I forfeit this years' match.
* PTO/Vacation/Sick - yeah, I'll get none of that either.  I assume they'll only pay me for the hours worked?  I guess I need to inquire if this is 40h/week or 8hx5d?  I've always had a very flexible working role, I'm in IT, you work when shits broke, which sometimes means nights and weekends and 12 days straight.
* Insurance - I guess I can go to my state marketplace and look for something?  I'm not a huge fan of what my company offers now, we're self-insured, but managed by BC/BS and we have vision and dental.  I'm really healthy, work out a bunch, have no preexisting conditions, take no regular meds.  I do have a family history of breast cancer (frequently get called back for diagnostic mammograms every 6 months) and a strong history of colon cancer (got my first colonoscopy at 35 and every 5 years since)

The positives for me is that I'm single, I have no children (two dogs), I bought this house in 2018 and own my car outright.  I know they can't make any guarantees, but I know the folks I'm talking to want me as a full-time employee.  This project will take a good 2+ years and I'm hopeful to get hired on at some point.  If I don't go this route, since my customer is taking their business elsewhere, my company is going to put me on the bench at one point in the near future anyway, so, it's time to move.  Do I need an employment lawyer to look this all over?  Do I need some sort of tax person/personal finance person to guide me?  Thanks for any/all input!",finance,1652550205

Even after Friday’s rebound, Apple is now underperforming the S&amp;P 500 for the year. And this, analysts say, is worrisome.  “It is a troubling sign when investors sour on best of breed names in an already difficult tape,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Apple’s slide “is part of a larger trend of investor risk aversion.”  Apple’s immense profits have made it a popular destination for investors seeking safe haven assets amid market turmoil. But it’s now being swept up in the selling that started with more speculative growth stocks, which are valued more for their promise of future profits, making them more susceptible to higher interest rates and inflation.

From my understanding, I dont think this includes SPX/DJI, so perhaps, at this point, all the money Fed injected to the market since MAR2020 are simply deleted, if not more printed money from Fed, so is it still reasonable to believe inflation will go to peak? 

So while I understand that the unlimited money injected to the economy can circulate in commodities sectors, what makes us think that inflation will still be continuous, when demand will be destroyed as Fed's intends to do so, especially when all the money are already spent and gone? 

This is occurring even before Fed's balance sheet on QT and hike interest rates enough to what they call neutral rates (which all Fed members believe it's located somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0). 

If Fed intends to take away liquidity in their balance sheet, like multiple investment report indicates, recession is near the corner and if so, commodities price can crash as light speed as any other big tech when demand is waning out, and if inflation rates is crashed and under control, isn't it another time to invest in big tech and ARK's related stocks (or Bond as well)?? 

Just a thought to think about to balance out between how much unlimited money from Fed has been injected to the economy since MAR2020 and how much market cap has been wiped out. 

I dont have PhD in economy, so I dont know all, but my simple math suggests that all the money Fed injected are spent and there really is no need to do QT and interest rate hikes. But I have been wrong and will be wrong, (and most importantly, I dont have anything to say in decision making process) while Fed is highly determined to increase the rate hikes.",finance,1652557260

personalfinance,Roth 401k v Traditional 401k Math and Understanding,"Hello, hoping someone can help me and maybe others see this and are helped themselves.

I've been in multiple discussions with friends about whether to do a Traditional or Roth 401k. I seemed to be getting told Roth is superior since I hope to make much better money in the future as I am recently out of college and hoping to stay in California for the rest of my life. Yet, unsure if that checks out with the math so maybe I am doing it wrong?

If I understand the wiki [https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional), unless I believe my effective tax rate will be higher at retirement, then I should continue with a Traditional 401k?

Currently I will be making 83,000 in the State of California, which puts me in a marginal bracket of 9.3% State and Federal of 22% with an approximate of 7% for FICA for majority of my earnings between 60k-83k for a total marginal tax rate of 38.3%. Effective of 22% according to online site below (unsure this matters).

Also, I am already doing a Roth IRA already of $6k since I was told this is superior to traditional IRA.

Unsure about the accuracy of these calculators, [https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator), but even making $200k my effective rate is 32%.

Therefore a Roth has me losing an extra 6% to taxes at minimum, so a Traditional 401k is the superior investment/retirement vehicle? Anything I am missing? Maybe if I lived in Florida now but wanted to retire to California? Really does seemed the Roth 401k may have been overhyped by my friends.

personalfinance,Can I afford to move?,"My apartment is small, uncomfortable, has no dishwasher or W/D, and an ineffective AC in only one room. I also WFH in the room without AC, so it’s getting gross as the weather finally heats up. I’ve been sucking it up living here for almost 3 years now and luckily my rent hasn’t been raised, but I’m kinda miserable. The cost of living here on my mental health and also the opportunity cost is pretty high in my opinion.

I now make $115,000 + benefits/ small bonus. My debt includes $14k car loan at 4%, $8k private student loan at 4%, and $13k in federal loans (0% currently, hoping it will be forgiven, but not banking on it). My current rent is $1300, and if I were to move into an apartment with the basic amenities I’m looking for it would likely cost between $2500-$3000 a month. 

Since starting my new job I’ve been aggressively paying off my debt. I recently finished paying off my credit card, but I just don’t know if it’s worth it to keep sacrificing my quality of life now just to get to a non-negative net worth before being able to move somewhere more comfortable in another 2-3 years from now. Especially since this debt is fairly low interest, I assume it’s not horribly irresponsible to not pay it off immediately and instead live a little more comfortably and also put money into an IRA in the meantime. What would you all do? I know this would hypothetically push retirement back by not being able to save as much, but I’m also fairly confident my income can and will continue to increase significantly over the years.",finance,1652564922

&amp;#x200B;

They(the FED) still have to get stuff off their books when rates are done, and no one is really sure how that is going to look when they start.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be watching the action in the currency market as rates move to see if any sign of dollar strength holds commodity prices down or flat. With Biden as president, I think there is only one way to resolve the supply/demand problem and that is by causing a recession which is the point of demand destruction we are hearing people talk about. For that reason, I believe the markets still have huge risk to the down side. These actions are deflationary, so I am doing everything with some form of caution as this mess unfolds.

As I have posted before, I am a fan of oil right now. At some point oil will go back to being weak, but until then, I am watching charts and buying. Oil at these prices is going to really boost earnings for OIL companies and that is why i am hanging out there right now. It is indeed the perfect storm for commodities. 

That said,

WTIC (light sweet crude) is making a little pattern here as it consolidates. Hopefully this next move is going to break upward and start a new leg pulling the oil stocks with it.

Many ways to play oil.

I like oil trust as one way. They pay monthly and follow oil. The more oil is, the bigger the dividend.

SJT has a beautiful 9% yield right now. With a healthy chart to boot. SBR isn't so bad either.

If the dollar was going to see weakness, I would suggest cand. oil trust because you get the advantage of currency exchange when they pay that beautiful dividend.

personalfinance,Unsure of my living situation. 3mo to act.,"Hello, I am in need of financial advice/guidence in this new hell hole of a situation that has unfolded in the past 2 years.

I'll keep it short and sweet. The situation is...

-My landlord has sold their property and the new owners are likely to increase the rent from $1250 to somewhere around $1800 a month due to Florida rental/real estate market. Best case scenerario they don't increase the rent by much. Worst case sceneraio they'll want to the keys to the apartment by end of my lease which is in 3 months and some change. I don't know when I will receive solid information on this that may change the outlook of the situation.

-I do not have a car. I rely on short range ridelift services to get to my job. Mass transit in South Florida is joke. I mention this because this currently is a major limitation to my oppertunities in the area that would allow me to have flexibility of the situation.

-I have a pre approval of $160,000 mortage with 10k down and interest rate of 4.825. I have tried to look around in the area but I keep getting priced out or outbid by other buyers. It ends by the 25th of May. I'm not even sure if that's enough time. Quite frankly I don't believe I'm ready for ownership and deal with the potential bullshit that comes with owning a 40+ year old overpriced condos...most of them require out of pocket repairs and updates (that's being generous).

-Roommates are a no go and familiy is questionable. I would like to add context to this but it would make me identifiable. For family, there just isn't enough space. For roommates, trust issues.

The real kicker of it all is that I have 30k saved up. I could put it all down on a condo to try my luck while being house poor or suck up the rental increases while buying a car in full so I do not get devasted by the monthlies. I could also try my luck moving out of state but with no marketable skills it makes my prospects gloomy.

I realize nobody has a crystal ball the predict if real estate will take a nose dive and perhaps things will move fast enough to affect the rental market(it wont), but what exactly should I do in this situation? I mean I have a stable job, 700+ credit, 30k savings...and yet this what I have to deal with? It really is difficult to think of anything else when you're home is at stake.",finance,1652570583

So given the environment there is a realistic possibility this bear market dips even more- kind of like what happened in 2018- but even if not it seems that the idea is the next bull run probably isn't in the near future just yet. 

So with all that said- if you had to make some guesses based off the data we have, when do you think we might see a change in trends in the stock market and crypto?

CryptoCurrency,"A lot of people seem to confuse ""Decentralized"" and ""Democratic""","TL;DR : The governance of a crypto being democratic doesn't mean it's decentralized.

&amp;#x200B;

The two concepts are kind of good, but they are not synonyms. Often they are even antagonistic. ""Decentralized"" means that no authority can take decisions for everybody. In a democracy this authority exists : it's ""the people"". Of course it's not ""you are decentralized or youre are not"". Taking countries as an example, no fully decentralized one exists, but countries like USA or Germany, which give a lot of power to regions/states compared to the federal level are more decentralized than France for example, where nearly every decision is taken by the Government and the parliement. Which doesn't mean that France is not a democracy (It is not a perfect democracy, but still much more democratic than a lot of other countries). We could even imagine a country being 100% democratic and 0% decentralized : a country where every decision you make (the food you eat, the clothes you wear...) is subject to a vote.  


So what about cryptos :  
If the decisions about a crypto are taken for everybody at once, it's centralized. Even if they are subject to a vote (Then it's the France of crypto, democratic but centralized).  
If no decision can be taken for everybody, it's decentralized. For example, if I can fork everytime I desagree with a modification, or when I want to implement one and others disagree, it's decentralized (and not democratic at all). Then the market decides, but that a very different subject.

&amp;#x200B;

Can government effectively Regulate cryptocurrencies without crippling the growth of the crypto ecosystem.","The German Ministry of Finance published a letter on the income taxation of bitcoin on Wednesday, stating:
This is the first time a nationwide consistent administrative directive has been issued on the topic.

According to the finance ministry, one of the most hotly debated topics at a hearing last year was whether the tax-free holding period for crypto loans and staking should be at least ten years.
In collaboration with federated states, the ministry stated:

The so-called 10-year limit does not apply to virtual currencies, according to the letter.


Cryptocurrency is classified as a ""private asset"" in Germany, which means it is subject to individual income tax rather than capital gains tax, according to crypto tax firm Koinly. Germany ""only taxes crypto if it is sold within the same year it was purchased.""

Koinly continued, saying:
After a one-year holding period, crypto profits are totally tax-free in Germany as a 'private sale.'
""In addition, gains on crypto sales up to €600 each calendar year remain tax-free,"" the firm noted, stressing that previously, ""that tax-free holding period is a minimum of 10 years when it comes to cashing in on staked bitcoin.""


I think that regulations governing cryptocurrencies are important to safe guard the rights of users and also build trust between  government , the crypto projects and users of cryptocurrencies which would aid mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. 
However the issuse I beg to ask is will government interest over ride that of the crypto ecosystem even to the extent of stifling innovation 

We have seen of recent more government and commercial institutions adopt the use of cryptocurrencies.
Also as more people opt to utilize innovative blockchain projects cratering to diverse needs and providing diverse solutions such as Chainlink the first and most successful oracle for Ethereum, RenderToken is a graphic rendering network that lets miners with excess graphics processing unit bandwidth parcel it out to artists and creative studios that need extra computing power, Minosis token is a deflationary hedge for the Minosis company a cryptocurrency mining company that allows users to join mining pools to earn rewards, provides mining software, and sources mining hardware, the use of cryptocurrencies would only increase. Blockchain technology utilizes cryptocurrencies for transactions and Blockchain is poised to revolutionize modern civilization just has the internet has done. The need for regulation becomes without a doubt I think important

It is hard to imagine any government placing another entities interest above it's own. However I think that laws governing cryptocurrencies should not be stringent to the extent that they stifle innovation and the ecosystem growth.

Historical, along with current data can be found here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/

As we know, Tether is supposed to be backed by 1:1 to the USD by Tether’s reserves. Tether allegedly has fiat, bonds, and other assets to do this (will address this a bit more below). Even though Tether is near its’ peg, the change in market cap shows an overwhelming amount of redemption.

This is concerning for a few reasons, for one because the overall market is down. Meaning, the assets in Tether’s reserve also most likely are down as well. I’m not just talking about the crypto market, either. Since we do not have full transparency in Tether’s backing, many have speculated it’s tied to assets like BTC, which is also way down as well. Meaning, their backing “power” may be lower than it was previously and not exactly at 1:1.

As an example, for arguments sake, let’s say that BTC was bought and fully backed the USDT. Their average price for backing was when Bitcoin was at 30k. Now let’s say the market dips, and bitcoin goes to 27k. At the same time, many start redeeming Tether to cash out to fiat out of fear of the market conditions. This means that the backing of Tether is no longer 1:1 and since people are redeeming, Tether would have to sell off its bitcoin reserves for a loss of 10% to cover the redemption.

economy,M1 vs M1 velocity! Please ELI5 why the economy isn’t literally on fire?,"Ok so this is from another post I made and now I really want an ELI5 pretty please. I’m just going to copy my pro gal reply to someone else in a different post where I ended up having this question:

“Yeah in theory and reality, there’s more “liquidity” available than 8800/person.

But if we all wanted our own cash safe in our house, still just $8800 per person (not even including the rest of the world, and when you consider that the usd is the world reserve currency), more interesting thought food.

What I’m not so educated on is how this 2.2T is effectively 20T. I mean I get velocity, and I get that for example, a house can really be worth a lot more and sell for a lot more, because we aren’t all selling our houses at the same time. 

One thing that I haven’t figured out is how do we have so much inflation if it seems velocity is cratering?

Like if money is exchanging hands so much slower, why are prices also rising?

Edit to add: is it just because the fed has massively pumped m1 m2 etc? Is that it? Like the fed has basically increased the “M” stuff in an attempt to proportionally offset the velocity crater?

And if so, is this inflation we’re seeing the result of the true recovery from the Covid recession?

It makes sense I think? So velocity craters, like historically cratered. So the fed proportionally pumped the ever loving fuck out of the Ms, and now, there’s so much liquidity a slight bump in velocity caused a huge increase in price…?

Edit again: so looking at M1 supply, then M1 velocity, they seem to be inversely proportional, so… I mean, it really does look like that’s what happened. M1 supply is up 4x since the crisis started, M1 velocity is down from 5x to 1x.

Seems extremely proportional.

You know what’s scary? How the velocity, looking further back… was around 10x back in 2008, steadily declining ever since.

Supply is up about 20x since that same time period.

That’s a wtf. Like a real wtf. I’d love it if someone could ELI5 why our economy isn’t completely fucked right now, based on M1 vs M1 supply since 2008.”",finance,1652629869
personalfinance,Bought a used car from a dealer and running into several issues,"This is going to be long and I apologize for that. 

I purchased a 2019 Honda Civic Type R with 37,329 miles on April 30th. I had a great experience initially when coming into the dealer to test drive the vehicle. I even indicated to my salesperson that I had a great experience working for their sister branches in the past. 

After test driving the vehicle I was willing to move to next steps. I asked my salesperson if an extra key and manual were included and he indicated yes. I was able to come to a deal with the manager and we were ready to proceed with paperwork but I wanted to check the car once more but they indicated that it was getting moved back to get detailed. I indicated to the manager that I will return back with the title and extra keys for the Subaru WRX and finish all the paperwork then, giving me an opportunity to take a look at the vehicle but he said if I leave there is no deal. We proceeded after there was no indication that I was going to be able to see the vehicle. At this point I know now that I should have left from the dealership all together. I was unable to see the car and no second key was present at the table which I asked for twice at this point. The plan was to go home to pick up the extra keys and title for the 2016 Subaru WRX I was trading in. All the paperwork was completed before I left to go back home. 

I came back to the dealer with all of the items and handed them over to the dealership staff. I proceeded to get to my new car and noticed several scratches that I was unable to see earlier as the car had pollen completely all over it. I also noticed three distinct cigarette burns on the driver seat that were originally covered up with a paper. I also asked about the extra key and manual and the salesperson said they didn’t have it but I can come back and they will contact the previous owner for the items and get everything straightened out including the scratches buffed and cigarette burns taken care of. 

I came back a few days later on May 5th and I had contacted my salesperson about a noise from the front of the vehicle I noticed during my drive home from the dealer, a squeaking and clanking noise. He took the car to the back to buff out the scratches but no improvement was made. He indicated to me to bring the vehicle back for service for the noises, seat, etc. The manager at that time indicated he had contacted the previous owner about the key and manual but they are working on it. 

I setup an appointment for the service a few days later on May 12th and had an appointment at 3PM. During the time between my next visit I contacted the used car manager who indicated that the vehicle I traded in was in terrible condition and over $5,000 worth of work was necessary and that it failed MD inspection. I had taken the car for inspection two weeks prior to trading it in and received several quotes from dealers and organizations for more than what I received from Ourisman. The WRX had 29,000 miles on it and was kept in perfect condition. I had taken it for it’s service a few days before trading it and everything was in perfect condition. I was told that I received the better deal and I should be happy with whatever I have going on with the Honda Civic Type R. 

I arrived for my appointment and was told they can’t service my Honda as they don’t work on Hondas. Finally, after some further conversations I was told they will look into the issues. After about an hour of waiting I was told they need more time so I can leave the car or bring the car back. I had no way of getting back as it’s a 40 minute drive to drop my mother off who came to the dealer with me and another 40 minutes to my home. We said we will bring the car but we indicated that we are beginning to become frustrated with this whole situation. 

My mother spoke with the manager at the dealer that day. Told him the entire situation and he began by saying that nobody ever said they had an extra or a manual. The car is as is and it should’ve been inspected prior. I would have been able to if they allowed me and did not cover up things such as cigarette burns. They indicated they will work on finding the key but will not replace the seat cover with the burns. I was told to go through the upholstery shop that the dealer goes through, to fix the burns will cost $1,900. On the drive home the squeaking and clanking was very apparent and occurred for 40 minutes straight. 

We brought the vehicle back the next day on May 13th and left the vehicle at the dealer. After eight hours I received a call from the service representative that they don’t hear any noises and that they can’t do anything. I was told that I can bring the vehicle in again on May 23rd to drive with a technician. I indicated to the representative that I can get a recording of the issue and they said sure.  I have now recorded the issue of the squeaking and clanking noises, I am ready to share them with the dealer but not sure how much help it will be due the lack of consideration from the dealership all together. 

At this point, I am extremely upset and exhausted with my experience at this dealership. I have worked for Ourisman and I was never trained or told to not help customers let alone lie to them outright. 

I need help with this situation as this back and forth has me seriously thinking the dealership is trying their best to exhaust my warranty where they will not cover anything. The car is not in condition I was told it was in nor is it in the condition I understood it was when I signed the paperwork. 

I apologize for the long message but I need help and wanted to see what can be done. 

My next steps were filing a complaint form with Attorney General, posting a complaint on the Better Business Bureau, trying to contact corporate but they haven’t been willing to give me the number nor can I find it online. 

I purchased the vehicle from a Dodge, Chrysler, Ram dealer and have contacted Honda manufacturing directly and they indicated the dealer I purchased it from take care of all these problems.

stocks,An Overview of Musk's Proposed Twitter Acquisition and Discussion of Recent Events.,"I want to focus on the recent developments in Musk's offer to acquire twitter, and some aspects not always discussed in 3 minute finance articles or headlines. But first, a refresher:

Elon Musk built a 9.2% stake in Twitter during the first few months of 2022.  On April 20th, he offered to take Twitter Private recently at $54.20 per share, claiming he can unlock the company’s potential.  Musk secured financing the next day and entered an agreement to buy twitter.  Recently he announced the deal was “on hold” pending investigation of spam and bot accounts.  

This recent development about bots is unusual, especially considering Musk’s  proximity to Twitter.  This should have been a known concern to Musk.  One would think he would have investigated this before he agreed to purchase the company.  So, what exactly is going on?  Why the erratic behavior?  To understand, we must first look at Musk’s financing:  

Musk Secured a total of  $46.5B in funding on April 21st.  This includes:  $13B of debt for Twitter the company, 12.5B in margin loans secured against Tesla stock, and $21B in equity investment from Musk.  

The debt and margin financing has a variable interest rate of 3-month SOFR +3%, and will currently cost $1B in maintenance per year plus 5% amortization for both debt facilities.  Twitter cash from operations was only $600M in 2021, and not likely to exceed $1B in 2022.. 

The $12.5B margin loan has an initial 20% LTV with a margin call at 35%.  This will require $62.5B of Tesla shares to be pledged. The fall in Tesla’s stock price has made this facility unattractive.   As of close Friday, Tesla was worth $769.85 per share.  This equates to a pledge of 81.2M shares at current prices.  Musk had 88.3M shares pledged as of 6/30/2021, this would bring the total to 169.5M of 173M shares.  This is likely not very palatable for Musk or Tesla investors.  

The $21B in cash required to complete the deal throws in an extra wrench. If he were to sell Tesla shares, he would have to sell at least $25B, likely more, to come up with $21B after tax.  He can’t do this and pledge sufficient shares for his margin loan facility.  Spacex is highly illiquid and likely not useful as collateral.  His final option is to find additional investors to come up with the $21B.  This is unlikely to happen, investors are already  unwilling to buy Twitter at a 30% discount to Musk’s acquisition price with Musk as the largest shareholder, and Musk's claim that he “doesn’t care about the economics” does him no favors in this endeavor.  There were reports he asked around the big PE firms, none of which were interested in equity.  The debt load added in the first financing transaction will also make twitter equity even less attractive to investors.   

On May 13th, Musk took to Twitter to say his acquisition was on hold pending investigation of the calculations of bots and spam accounts on twitter.  There are no carve-outs in the acquisition agreement to allow him to do this.  Further, to expedite the deal, he waived any right to view additional non-public financial and analytical data from Twitter.  Twitter already discloses that their mDAU spam estimate may not be accurate.    

Per Twitter’s most recent 10k:  

&gt;The numbers of mDAU presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on internal company data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement across our large number of total accounts around the world. Furthermore, our metrics may be impacted by our information quality efforts, which are our overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on the service, inclusive of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts. For example, there are a number of false or spam accounts in existence on our platform. We have performed an internal review of a sample of accounts and estimate that the average of false or spam accounts during the fourth quarter of 2021 represented fewer than 5% of our mDAU during the quarter. The false or spam accounts for a period represents the average of false or spam accounts in the samples during each monthly analysis period during the quarter. In making this determination, we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.

Twitter discloses that their calculation of spam mDAUs could be greater than 5%.  

Recall Musk’s financing woes mentioned earlier.  Contrary to popular belief, Musk cannot break the contract at his discretion and pay the termination fee. The only ways that Musk could leave are if twitter misled him or his financiers pulled out. The goal of Elon’s bot check appears to be to find Twitter in violation of reps and warranties.  This would give him a $1B termination fee.  If it could be shown that Twitter misled Musk (and investors) about the presence of bots, they would be in violation and Musk could terminate the contract.  He can then reconsider entirely or offer a lower price for the acquisition, which he can more easily afford.  Given the above stated information, I find it difficult to believe Twitter can be found in violation of reps and warranties.  Musk specifically skipped DD that could have revealed flaws in their calculation methods and Twitter makes clear that, despite their best efforts, Twitter could be off in their assessment of bot or spam mDAUs.  

On the 14th, Musk said his team would check 100 accounts following \\@twitter to see if more or less than 5 are bots.  If asked for critique, any high school stats student could absolutely demolish this asinine experiment design.    

Musk appears to be in a legal pickle.  He has already agreed to buy Twitter, but the financing terms have turned against him.  Obviously he still has sufficient assets to buy the company, just not on the terms he or Tesla shareholders would like.  

I don’t see there being enough evidence to find twitter in violation, no matter how many bots are in the 100 sampled accounts following \\@twitter.  This would mean that twitter would be able to compel Musk to complete the transaction, even if it is against his will.  Unless he loses financing, which was almost entirely unconditional, he cannot escape.  But, would they?  Twitter’s existing board and management has little incentive to follow through.  It would be a long, messy , and expensive legal battle that would ultimately result, if successful,  their new boss sacking them vindictively.  

This looks like a clear cut case of buyer’s remorse for Mr. Musk.  His financing of the deal is likely already unattractive for Tesla shareholders and Musk himself, given the recent drop in Tesla stock.  Virtually all social media companies have re-rated significantly lower since he made his offer as well.  Musk either wants to pay less or leave entirely, it appears, and it will be very difficult for him to do this on paper.  Musk has already violated many laws and norms so far, what happens next is anyone's guess.  It will be interesting to see what comes of this.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  Deteriorating conditions and Tesla's recent fall has made the deal unpalatable for Musk.  Musk must pledge 80M of his remaining 85M shares to his margin loan facility and come up with $21B to complete financing at Tesla's current price -- something he can't do.  He cannot simply break the contract as many people think.  This bot search appears to be an attempt to find Twitter in violation, and likely should not work.  If successful, he could leave or re-offer less.",finance,1652631528
personalfinance,The age-old question of Renting vs Owning - Need advice (short term),"Hello all - long-time lurker here, and in need of some assistance. Currently stuck in the decision to keep renting or to buy a home. (I know right now is a seller's market).

Little back story and information:

The wife and I are located in Iowa. We both have recently gotten really great jobs that pay well for the area. My job is fairly new and at a big company that is located all across the US (important note). The wife has a contract that she will need to finish out (2 years).

We are currently saving a lot of money by just renting our little 1 bedroom apartment. To put it nicely though, the apartment is not great haha. The place is known to have quite a few issues, the building is very old, cleanliness is lacking at times, the crowd that can be around is not the best, the amenities are not great, etc. You get the picture. 

So we are looking at moving. Here is the issue, we don't know if we should keep renting or look at getting a home. 

We have some money saved up and continue to save monthly so we could realistically get a home if we wanted in a few months. 

The problem is we don't know if we want to stick around the area for more than 2 or 3 years. I have read a lot about how you should only get a house if you plan on sticking around with it for at least 5 years. The thing is, we are unsure, we may stick around but we may also look at relocating (among many reasons, we are fed up with Iowa winters lol).

Mainly just want reinforcement that continuing to rent is probably the right call, but I can't help but feel we would be burning money. We may only be around for 2 or 3 years, or possibly longer, we just don't know.

Committing to a house (especially in this market) feels like a LOT. But also renting feels bad as we are paying someone else's mortgage lol 

Let me know if any other details are needed. This would be our first home. 

In advance, appreciate all the insight and assistance.",finance,1652631714

I'm not sure why they didn't taper mortgage bonds sooner I understand it creates liquidity but why directly into housing during such a strong market with limited supply and such demand.

Next month they will begin to stop buying MBS and will most likely have to unload some in the open market soon correct? I'm no economist but this will have to affect something.

Can we create a community for those who lost money in the hack and would like to follow the events to eventually apply to the DOJ for our losses?


story: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency

&gt;Two individuals were arrested this morning in Manhattan for an alleged conspiracy to launder cryptocurrency that was stolen during the 2016 hack of Bitfinex, a virtual currency exchange, presently valued at approximately $4.5 billion. Thus far, law enforcement has seized over $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency linked to that hack.

&gt;“Today’s arrests, and the department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “In a futile effort to maintain digital anonymity, the defendants laundered stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions. Thanks to the meticulous work of law enforcement, the department once again showed how it can and will follow the money, no matter what form it takes.”

&gt;“Today, federal law enforcement demonstrates once again that we can follow money through the blockchain, and that we will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The arrests today show that we will take a firm stand against those who allegedly try to use virtual currencies for criminal purposes.”

&gt;Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, both of New York, New York, are scheduled to make their initial appearances in federal court today at 3:00 p.m. in Manhattan.

&gt;According to court documents, Lichtenstein and Morgan allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin that were stolen from Bitfinex’s platform after a hacker breached Bitfinex’s systems and initiated more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions. Those unauthorized transactions sent the stolen bitcoin to a digital wallet under Lichtenstein’s control. Over the last five years, approximately 25,000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein’s wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan. The remainder of the stolen funds, comprising more than 94,000 bitcoin, remained in the wallet used to receive and store the illegal proceeds from the hack. After the execution of court-authorized search warrants of online accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan, special agents obtained access to files within an online account controlled by Lichtenstein. Those files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet that directly received the funds stolen from Bitfinex, and allowed special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94,000 bitcoin that had been stolen from Bitfinex. The recovered bitcoin was valued at over $3.6 billion at the time of seizure.",cryptocurrency,1652632873

While explaining the 20% APR thing, he just tells me to stop that he knew what happened. I didn't believe him at first, but then he interrupted me to tell me this story:

""Back in the 2001, there was a lady who was promising people if they invested 50 thousand dollars, she was going to give each one of them around huge returns monthly

Back then, things were rough in El Salvador. We had two earthquakes that devastated the country, and salvadorans were economically desperate. This lady was transferring each ""investor"" around 1K monthly, and that got more people interested in ""investing"" more money. An old friend of my dad put around 40 thousands dollars in this scheme. This friend had a house fully paid, but when he saw the big returns, he mortgaged the house. He tried to convice my dad, but after listening him, my dad said no and warned him that he it was impossible to get such returns without even knowing how the money was being invested. 

Couple of months later, he was devastated. He became an alcoholic. It turned out the lady was running a full blown Ponzi scheme. She disappeared with all the money, and the ""returns"" were actually money from other investors. He also told my dad that he wanted to commit suicide because he was about to lose his house, and his family was gonna have to live on the streets. My dad told him to think about his wife and children, and much they were going to miss him. My dad conviced him that suicide wasnt the solution, and that he could always bounce back.  

The solution my dad told him was to look for a better Bank with lower interest rates/lower payments. Of course that was gonna take more years to pay off but that was gonna 

15 years later, my dad saw his friend again,  and they went for coffee. The friend quit drinking (15 years sober) and he was so thankful for helping him turn his life around. He was able to send his kids to college, got a promotion in his job which made him able to pay off the house entirely""

The lesson here is: There is always a way to recover. Everything can be solved. I know it is not easy, but you can work hard to bounce back.

I mean after seeing how much Citadel made from attacking UST, don’t you think other banks will likely be eyeing up their next target, and who better than the stinking abscess of Tether.

It is pegged 1:1 to USD, and each coin is backed by 1 oz of pure baloney, imported directly from Transylvania.

This coin offers a totally non-suspicious 21% interest rate APY, but if you are an early adopter you can get in on the action and be rewarded with a 39% interest rate APY, but you have to be quick before all of the seats fill up.

This stablecoin is also supported by numerous cryptographic experts which can be found on Youtube. Please check out their channels for more info on this amazing financial opportunity.

Don't miss out on the amazing opportunities that this coin can provide you with. Shady Coin is the newest generation of crypto coin.

personalfinance,"Might have an opportunity to buy a house at auction for family member, but would be using my emergency fund to come up with the cash for it...","The house across the street from my mother is going to be auctioned off by the county next month.  I'm thinking of trying to buy it for my sister, so that she and her four kids will have a stable place to live for the first time since she left home &amp; so my mother will have family nearby as she ages.

Edit:  just to be clear, my sister and my mother are down for this plan.  They just don't have a way to afford it themselves.

In the 2000s the house next door to my mother went for $4,000, but no one in the family had $4,000.  I was a broke college student at the time.  Also my parents originally bought their own house in the 90s for $7,500.  So I'm hoping the house at this auction goes for between $4K and $7K.  Honestly if the auction goes over $7K, I'm not sure it would be worth it - it needs A LOT of work.

(If these number seem strange to you, yes this is in the USA, what the deal is is these are itty bitty houses on tiny lots in a declining town of 500 people, in the poorest county in the state.)

I can come up with about $7K cash if I use all of my non-retirement savings (emergency fund) and all of what's in my personal checking.  That'd still leave at least $3K in my wife and my joint checking.  (And yes, my wife is on-board with helping to get this house for my sister.)  But you know, obviously the problem there is it wouldn't leave any emergency savings for us.

So my plan is, take the $7K that I technically already have as the budget, but try to find other ways to acquire at least some of the cash.  I've asked our other siblings if they can chip in, but so far none have replied.  My mom is on social security, but said she would chip in what she can.  My sister doesn't have any money, and I don't expect she would be able to pay me back.  I'm doing it for her kids.

My wife and I have a low-six-figures combined income so bouncing back isn't the problem; it's this just comes at a time when we were already down from a bunch of other one-off expenses (as such things always do).  Plus we just bought our own house - not in a ghost town - last year.

Ever since the market dip in 2020 and then rising inflation, I've been shoveling every unused dollar into my 401k and Roth IRA instead of keeping cash on hand.  I can free up some extra income by ""not doing that,"" but there's only two paychecks before the house auction.  I have $3K in Roth IRA for this year that I could take out and still be able to put back before the end of the tax year.  (Is that December or April, to put a withdrawn contribution back?)  Not sure if I should pre-emptively pull it, or only if I have a true financial emergency later?

I looked into taking a loan against my 401k which would seem to be the perfect option, except (!) the fine print says if you leave your employer before it's paid back it turns into a withdrawal.  Wouldn't you know it, this would be the year, after years as a government contractor, that I might be converting to Fed shortly.  Like I said, these things always come up when everything else is happening, too.

My wife works for the State government, so she has some other kind of plan that's not a 401k.  I don't know too much about it; not sure if we could borrow money against hers.",finance,1652638390
personalfinance,Sell my house and buy a pricier one? Or stay put?,"I'm a beneficiary of this ridiculous market.  We bought our house in August of 2020 before prices went crazy.  As a result, we have about $160k in equity if we were to sell today.  Its not our forever home, but it's perfectly fine for right now.  Our interest rate is also 3%.

We will need to at some point get a bigger house.  We will need 4 bedrooms and either an in-law suite for my mother or just more space in general for her to eventually live with us.  With the equity we've earned in our house we could put that toward a down payment and buy something in the $800k range.  This would be enough to get the forever home now.  Unfortunately the interest rate would be like 5-6% now.  That said, we can afford a higher monthly payment but obviously things would be tighter. 

Obviously no one knows what the market is going to do.  Interest rates probably won't go lower, but the home prices might go down (which would effect our own houses sale price too obviously).  So I'm kind of torn.  Right now we are thinking of waiting til the fall and making a decision then, but just curious what the more financially sound people of reddit think?",finance,1652641277
personalfinance,Receiving money to invest it. How do I start?,"I live in the US, Ohio.

I will be receiving a small amount (I guess it's small for a business) to start a business, I don't know exactly how much but between 5k-30k probably to start.

I am 18, I don't plan on going to college until next year. Graduating this friday from High School and I want to take the rest of this time to educate and learn how to manage a business.

So, I wanted to know what books, courses, youtube videos, etc could be useful. I had college Statistics while in highschool but not much about economy.

Should I take a loan instead of using those 5-30k and get a low interest rate on the loan?

My niche is to open an arcade as there can be a lot of demand for games during this summer. 

Should I just go into an online shop and get more profit to start the physical company instead?

personalfinance,Confusion with the Flowchart,"So growing up, my parents have always been terrible with money and thus the topic stresses me out immensely. This subreddit has been eye-opening and now that I'm in my early 30's I finally feel a bit more in control of things but still feel like I could be doing more. I'm been following the Flowchart (albeit loosely).

My situation: 

* I work at a job paying 55K (currently looking for positions in the 75K range)
* My monthly expenses average about $1400
* My only ""real"" debt is my student loans 
   * $8400 @ 3.65% (private currently making $80 autopay payments) 
   * $13500 @ 4.375% (federal loans in deferment)
* I have a home and the mortgage is in my name, but my parents pay that while I pay the rest of the monthly bills (The mortgage is $1000 monthly and this will eventually become their retirement home)
* I have 61K in my 401K (10% Contribution), $6100 in cash, and $5500 in savings. 
   * I know the cash isn't ideal, but it's an ""out of sight, out of mind"" situation.

My goal is to look at purchasing a second home. My idea is to treat my current home as an income property on paper, seeing as I already have ""tenants."" I know I'll need at least 20% down for a second house, so I'm partially looking at saving for that. Since my private loan is only 3.65%, the flowchart doesn't indicate that I pay that off quite yet, and with federal loans on pause, I know this subreddit is on the fence about making that a priority. I recently paid off my car but it needs some work and since I WFH that doesn't feel like a priority either. Not sure if I'm on the right path or I need to reevaluate things.",finance,1652646694
personalfinance,Tips on how to negotiate a better raise?,"Hello! So I've been a teachers assistant at a daycare for almost 4 years now. When I first started the job, I was getting paid $13/hr. The rate was a dollar above the minimum at the time. The last couple of years, the city where I live at has been raising the minimum wage up a dollar each year until the minimum reaches $15/hr. So after almost a year working there, when the minimum wage went up, I was bumped to $14/hr. Minimum wage was now at $13 at that moment in time. When my one year contract was officially up, I asked about my annual raise and was told that I already got a raise when the minimum wage went up. I was annoyed at that point in time. It wasn't a raise based on my tenure or my performance. That ""raise"" was because the minimum wage went up and they had to have a competitive rate. I didn't think too much of it the first time it happened and brushed it off. However, every year afterwards when the minimum went up, my rate has always been a dollar above the minimum. No actual raise at all. Last month, I was at $16/hr, a dollar above the minimum. My lead teacher of the classroom that I work at was going to be gone for 3 weeks because of personal reasons. Since I'm the next in command of the classroom, I acted as the lead and took in the extra responsibilities. My work bestie advised me that I should ask for a temporary raise while my lead was gone. So I emailed upper-management, explained my situation, and was surprised when they temporary raised me up to $19.23/hr for while my lead was gone. In the email, they said that they see the value in me and appreciate me so they asked if I was interested in being a lead. I said not at this time but said I would be interested in the future. They also asked me last year if I wanted to become a lead but I said no also. They were fine with that and then told me in the email that they wanted to give me a new rate for when I don't have those extra responsibilities. They just wanted to know my education level and if I took any childhood education classes. I told them that I have an associates degree and that I took one class in childhood development. They did not respond back but found out on my paysub a week later that they gave me a quarter raise. Yup, a quarter. So if I didn't take that class, what? I would have gotten a 10 cent raise or something?? Also, after befriending and talking to my coworkers, I have come to find out that the newbies are getting paid $16/hr!!!! So last month, before my lead left for 3 weeks and before I emailed upper-management, I was getting paid the same as a newbie, even though I've been there for almost 4 years now! I know some of you might think that it's my fault for letting them push me around or something but believe me, I've been bringing up this issue every time the minimum wage went up. I would talk to my director and they gave me the same excuse that I already got a dollar raise each year. But now newbies are getting paid $16/hr and I'm currently at $16.25/hr. Only got that 25 cent raise because I spoke up about my lead being gone for 3 weeks. If I didn't, I would still be getting paid the same as a new employee.

So I have a meeting with someone from upper-management tomorrow afternoon. I'm not planning on saying that I found out from my coworkers that they're getting paid $16/hr since we're not supposed to talk about our pay amongst one another. I actually found a job listing for a teachers assistant from the company I work for and the pay listed is between $16-$18/hr. I took a screenshot of it and I'm planning on using it as evidence for my argument that I was getting paid the same as a new employee. And that now I'm just a quarter above them even though I've been there for almost 4 years now. I want to ask for $18/hr since that's the maximum that they're paying for an assistant. Also, I want to be a lead teacher but I want to tackle this issue before I promote myself. I'm hoping that I can bring my reasoning across as to why I freaking deserve a raise. If the meeting doesn't go the way I want it to, then I will start looking for a job this summer. I'm fed up not being appreciated for the time that I've dedicated to this job only for them to just use me like that. Any tips on how to negotiate a better rate will be very much appreciated!

personalfinance,Helping Parents Retire: Who do I contact? Best financial advisors? Need Guidance,"Hi good peoples, 

My mind is going in circles so I'm making this post to hopefully have a sense of direction. I'm not that financially literate.

Context: Parents own a home in the greater Seattle area with \~$60k left on the mortgage. They are paying $2250 a month at 3.75%. The estimated home value is about $664,700 according to Zillow (don’t know how accurate this is).

Retirement: $130K cash savings account, \~$30k Moms 401k, dad doesn’t have one.

Dad (60) has LLC for his own commercial truck driving (25+ years), and mom (60) works for a nonprofit. Combined take-home income I believe is around 100k. 

I'm 23 and got heavily into investing over the past 3 years. I've realized that my immigrant parents have no clue what they are doing which is why they don’t have retirement money. I'm very worried about them. They don’t have issues paying bills but my dad is getting old and sick so we want him to retire. He’s the typical hard-ass stubborn dad that works himself to death (70-hour weeks for decades), he won't listen to us so I want to come up with a plan to prove he can retire and they will be fine. He claims he still wants to work until he can afford to build a house back home for his family in east Africa but his health has been getting progressively worse in the past 8 years.

Thing is, I don’t know what they should do if he sells the truck and retires. I don’t know if they should sell the house or not. My Mom wants to pay off the house with the cash at hand now but I'm not sure if that's a good idea either since their interest rate is decent.

I was angry when I found out that most of their cash (the 130K) was just sitting in a savings account and not invested in the stock market this entire time. Dad has also lost 100k+ in a stupid pyramid scheme, he has no clue what he's doing financially speaking. At this point, I don't even see a point in them investing the money since they are old and the market forecast doesn't look too good. It would make more sense for them to keep the liquid cash right?

What is the best-case scenario here? Should I seek a financial advisor for them? I would need to be involved due to the language barrier (Dad doesn't even have a high school diploma). What can I learn to manage their assets for the better? Is there a basic book I can read?

Worst case scenario: My siblings and I pay their bills until they pass. Fortunately, I have a well-paying job (electrical/computer engineer) and so do my sisters (RN, CPA). We still have to put my youngest brother (21) through college though which we all need to consider. This is obviously not ideal for my siblings and me but I do not mind helping them at all and have paid their bills some months this past year.

Please give me some advice, I am worried about my father.

TLDR: Parents don't have retirement money and my ill stubborn father won't stop working himself to death. Who can I talk to? What can I do to be responsible for them?",finance,1652649179
personalfinance,Housing Investment Options in Seattle,"Hi, I am a 37yo male living in r/Seattle (Ballard) and own a 2 bed/2 bath townhouse that I bought in 2019 for $550k, current value is around $750k.  I owe $325k on the 30 year mortgage at 3.625% interest rate.  I have a $195k HELOC on this property in case I need to use the funds for something else.

I am a remote worker and make $115k a year on W2, and that is income that lenders are using for prequalification.  I make additional $75k a year as independent contractor, but lenders won't use that income for prequalification.  My end goal is to hopefully buy a single family home, as I think those are the best longer term investment, but I'm appearing to be priced out of that market right now as the median family home is $850k+ in Seattle.  Interest rate increase (currently \~5.4%) is also lowering my purchase power.

Would you consider selling the townhome and buying a single family home - more expensive/nicer?  Keep the townhome, rent it out (rent would fully cover the mortgage), and buy a condo with the $195k HELOC as down payment in order to avoid rent expense?  Stay put and aggressively pay down the townhouse mortgage?  Move to a cheaper city (buy a single family home and either keep/rent townhouse or sell it; I do like bigger cities and walkability)?

personalfinance,How to Rebuild Finances After Property Purchase? I'm nearly always in debt.,"I have a CC debt of around 4K. It's not that high, except for the fact that I'm currently paying mortgages and rent right now. I'm on the lease until August, so I'm paying around 1K a month - it's a little useless since I live somewhere else and just bought a house. I pay around $850 a month for the mortgages (put a TON down for a lower interest rate, which is why I'm in a financial mess). 

I had a really high savings account, but it's been depleted with home buying. Even if I spent a lot during a month, I was always able to pay off the entire balance on each CC by dipping a little into Savings. But without my savings account (depleted it all for down payments/closing costs), my salary isn't enough to cover my CC costs anymore. 

I pay $250 a year for my phone bill, $79 per month on TV subscriptions, and around $100/month on job hunting things. I have pretty high medical bills. I met my deductible of 2K, so now I spend around $150-200 per month. I pay $200 for my car and have 20K in student loan debt. I haven't started making payment on that yet.

I cut down on the TV subscriptions and now only have Hulu for 2.99 and Disney+ for 8.34 with tax. I also have a Kindle Subscription for $10. 

I make around 80K base, 95K w/bonuses (but that's only at the end of the year). 

Gas -- $64 - $80

The main issue is that I spend a lot eating out at restaurants or ordering food in. I've also been spending a lot on Amazon for furniture/associated costs, so it's been around 1.5K this month. I spent around 1.2K on groceries and eating out, which is painfully too high. It's mainly due to ordering through Ubereats. I deleted my accounts, but I'm worried that I'll get back on it. I've been ordering a lot for home improvement with Amazon, and it's getting a little addicting, so I removed my CC from the account. If my Kindle books weren't associated with Amazon, I'd delete my account entirely since it's getting a little addicting. 

Ironically, I pay $200 a month for a financial advisor who says that I'm doing great, but I'm really drowing. I have around 35K total in the IRA/401K, and then 4K in the stock market. I stopped 401K contributions because I feel really broke, but I want to start doing that again.

I think what I really need to do is cancel delivery, since the delivery fees add up. I've been going into the office every day, so I haven't had the interest in driving outside of work and back since the commute is 45 minutes.

stocks,The stock market is on a 6-week losing streak. How did we get here? Will it continue?,"\*\*The stock market is on a 6-week losing streak, the longest losing streak since 2001. How did we get here?\*\* 

The economy is in a very tight place and is likely going to get worse. This has caused stocks to come down, with major indexes down anywhere from 15% to 30%. CPI inflation is at 8.3% and has consistently been worse than expectations. The Federal Reserve is going to start tightening by essentially popping dollars out of existence (the opposite of money printing) and increasing interest rates to slow down the economy. Whether you’re trading or investing long term, it is important to be familiar with the market landscape and understand the reasons behind the volatility and price action we are seeing. Therefore I am making this post to help anyone who does not have a full picture of what is currently happening.

\*\*Inflation\*\*

The combination of the 2020 COVID lockdowns, Delta lockdowns, Omicron lockdowns, sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and decreasing globalization as countries try to reduce reliance on others, have all been inflationary. The lockdowns were originally disinflationary on the demand side (because people slowed spending when they were locked at home), which is why the Federal Reserve and central banks around the world expanded the money supply (i.e., printed a crap ton of money). However, we are now suffering the consequences of those actions. People were saving money because it was harder to spend it during the lockdowns, creating pent-up demand which is now showing itself in the form of unusually high spending and a very strong consumer. Coupled with the supply bottlenecks, this caused inflation to soar higher than at any point since the 1970s once economies began to speed back up.

\*\*The Federal Reserve\*\*

Stocks move up and down for a combination of different reasons. In my opinion, the most important factor deciding how stocks move is the Federal Reserve’s policies. The second most important factor is \*earnings\*. This is my opinion, and I know many people might disagree with me, but what you can’t disagree on is how important the Fed’s policies are in influencing stock prices. The Fed’s priority is to maintain price stability (i.e., control inflation). To do this, it has three main tools: the Fed Funds interest rate, open market operations, and setting reserve requirements. 

\*\*Fed funds interest rate\*\*

The federal funds rate is complicated, but it can be thought of as the price to lend money. When the fed funds rate is low, then banks can lend at very low interest. But when the fed funds rate is high, banks will lend at higher interest. When COVID hit, people stopped spending, so the Fed lowered the fed funds rate to 0, so banks could lower their interest rates and lend more money, which encouraged consumer and business spending and investment and ultimately boosted stock prices. However, now we are at a point where the economy is too hot and inflation is out of control. When inflation was this high in the 1970s, the Fed raised the fed funds rate to almost 20%. That’s not a typo. 20%. When the Fed pushed the funds rate this high, banks were going to lose money if they lent money at lower than 20%, and borrowers would have to be stupid to borrow money at 20% interest. Therefore, the economy was forced into a recession by the Fed in an attempt to stomp out inflation. This is the same thing the Federal Reserve is doing now. Inflation is very high, so the Federal Reserve is raising the fed funds rate to slow down the economy until inflation is stomped out. If inflation keeps increasing (or even staying the same), the Fed will have to increase the funds rate even more. During the pandemic, the rate was 0. In March, the Fed first increased the rate to 25 basis points (bp), or .25%. On May 4th, they increased it to 75 bp. But as inflation keeps persisting, economists are expecting the fed funds rate to go even higher. Last year, we were expected to reach a funds rate of .25% by the end of 2022. We reached that expectation two months ago. Right now, we are expecting to reach 2.75% by the end of this year. That is over 11 times higher than what we expected last year. 

\*\*Open market operations (“printing” money)\*\*

The Fed can also conduct open market operations, which means they can buy securities from banks or sell them to banks. When the Fed buys securities from banks, then the bank has more money to lend, which means there is more money, or more \*liquidity\*, in the economy. This is essentially how the Fed “prints” money (also called quantitative easing). Again, this encourages consumer and business spending and investment and boosts stock prices. The Fed only stopped this in March of this year. It was essentially keeping the money printer on while inflation was already over 7%. Now, the Fed needs to do the opposite of what it was doing two months ago. This time, the Fed needs to sell securities back to banks (the same ones that the Fed has spent the last two years buying). In June, the Fed is going to start doing this–selling securities back to banks and on the open market and then popping those dollars out of existence (the opposite of money printing). This is called quantitative tightening. Of course, this will have the opposite effect of money printing. The Fed essentially needs to sell back over $4.7 trillion worth of securities to banks, yet commercial banks currently only have about $3.38 trillion in cash. See the problem? The Fed will have to continue tightening for years if they want to get rid of all those securities, which means that if we go into an economic downturn, it will likely be prolonged.

\*\*Reserve requirements\*\*

Setting reserve requirements does the same thing as open market operations in the sense that it controls how much money banks can lend out. Essentially, if the Fed requires banks to hold more money, then they lend less. This is very straightforward.

\*\*What does this all mean? A recession?\*\*

Look at where we are. Inflation is out of control. Recall that the Fed forced us into a recession just to bring inflation to its knees. This is because uncontrolled inflation is single handedly the most dangerous thing to an economy, so a recession is always preferable. The Fed was continuing to stimulate the economy while inflation was running very hot, and now that it’s even worse, the Fed has to do the complete opposite of what it has been doing the past two years. The Fed will increase interest rates for the next year (or more), remove liquidity from the economy for years to come, and the economy will inevitably go into a downturn. In my opinion, people are underestimating the probability of a recession. Technically, a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Did you know that GDP fell 1.4% in Q1 of 2022? Another quarter of this and we will officially be in a recession. What about inflation? Is inflation peaking? If you look superficially at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, it shows 8.5% year over year inflation in March, and 8.3% YOY inflation in April. Does that mean inflation has peaked? Maybe, but a slight decrease in the year over year inflation rate is not enough to suggest that., especially because the 8.3% figure was actually higher than expectations. The Producer Price Index (PPI) shows inflation in terms of how much more producers are paying for the same things. This is a lot more effective in gauging the direction of inflation because it is a leading indicator of inflation. When producers are paying more, they pass those costs onto consumers afterwards, and it could be months until producers decide to pass on these costs. In April, PPI was 11%, which means that CPI inflation could go much higher if producers decide to pass on costs to consumers. 

\*\*Conclusion\*\*

Inflation is too high. The Fed is slowing the economy using every tool it has, just to keep inflation under control. In doing so, the Fed may put us into a recession. We are one bad quarter away from being in a recession. If we go into a recession, the Fed can’t save us. If you did not read the entire post, please read it.

solar,Backfed microinverter solar to subpanel,"Is it viable to backfeed an apartment subpanel directly from a microinverter rooftop solar array? From what I've read the enphase microinverters can automatically disconnect if grid power is not detected, so I wouldn't need a dedicated disconnect switch. The envoy monitoring hardware can also communicate with the panels through powerline communications. Thus, there won't be need for a long vertical run of conduit to the main meter/panel. 

I'm aiming for around 6kW and the only concern I have is the a 60A main breaker on the main panel, although the subpanel itself and SE cable to the sub is rated for 100A. My limited understanding is that I should be within the 120% rule since the main breaker is already technically derated, although I might need to upgrade main panel depending on its rating.",energy,1652680087
personalfinance,Should I get a second debt consolidation loan?,"So...in 2020 I bought a house. I had managed to get out of graduate school, had a new job lined up...and then there was COVID. I had a personal loan in place because of financial strains in graduate school, and then needed credit cards just to pay bills throughout 2020. More recently, a leak erupted in the house and that cost has been added to the pile as well.

My debt to income ratio is now approximately 85%.

Now...I'm having to make choices between which bills to pay and whether I can afford groceries, and my credit has suffered dearly (it was excellent, but is now ""fair/needs work""). I've accepted a job offer for a 2nd full time job, but it won't begin until August.

My question is this: is it worth it for me to take on a new loan for the sake of consolidating the 4 major accounts I'm currently drowning in (1 loan, 2 credit cards, and home repair payment)?

Will the subsequent lower monthly payment ultimately help me fix my damaged credit, despite the higher interest rates? I know that at first, my credit score will likely drop substantially, but then should greatly rise again thereafter because fewer accounts will have debt?

Seeking advice from those much wiser and money-savvy than I!

CryptoCurrency,I'm short term optimistic,"So it's now commonplace to come out and make loud public declarations of how ""realistic"" we are and how ""I told you"" that we're in a bear market that will probably last until around the next BTC halving. Usually followed why something along the lines of ""hold on and don't buy the dip just yet, the bottom is not in"".

Well, obviously I know shit about fuck, but I think we will see a run way before that.

The reason is that the current slump is caused by one single major and overwhelming driving factor: the expectation by the markets that the US Fed is going to inflict up to ten interest rate hikes on us just this year alone.

However, I say that's bollocks.

It's impossible that they destroy trillions of dollars of wealth during an election year in the US.

They know that price increases (price increases, not the underlying inflation that causes them. They're related but different) are an imminent political danger right now. But they also know that they don't need to do anything. Just to give the impression that they intend to do it. The Fed manages expectations, basically.

All they need is for the expectations to last long enough to get them past the elections, and they'll keep kicking the can for as long as necessary.

Basically, they're running a confidence scam, a Ponzi, just as they've always done.

Also, nothing has changed fundamentally for the policymakers. Their belief in debasing the currency as a way to tax people even more hasn't changed.

But back to crypto and financial markets generally speaking -- for how long will they be able to keep up the charade of the ""impending hikes""?

I'm not saying there won't be any hikes. I'm saying they won't be as severe as they make people believe, not by a mile.

Savvy people will know this and they'll start to buy and accumulate en masse. I give it until September, tops. I'm also not saying that we'll hit ATH so fast either. But I'm sure even if we see a bit more of a down trend between now and the summer, anyone who buys now is bound to make a nice profit in the short term.

Personally, I'm a pathological hodler. Meaning, I am a fanatical believer in the hypothesis that BTC (and crypto) is inevitably poised for a market cap two orders of magnitude larger than today's within our lifetime. At least one order of magnitude larger than today's before the end of the decade.

Meaning, I don't care about the next six months and I don't have a trading agenda. Any price is good for me (for now) because my outlook is more than 10 years.

I'm not saying this to sell you on anything. It's just my opinion on the current events.

CryptoCurrency,Will a fed issued USD stable coin make all other USD stable coins obsolete?,"Basically what the title says. If the federal reserve issues an official stable USD crypto, will all other USD stable coins become unneeded and die  sooner or later? On one hand you can say: creating a stable coin backed 1:1 by USD will be very easy then, because you can just use the fed USD coin to back it up. But on the other hand: Why would anyone use a different stable USD coin if there is an ""official"" USD crypto?

Tl;Dr: How will central bank stable coins affect other stable coins? What are your thoughts?

EDIT: Guys I posted this before work and now I'm back and there are like 200 comments, so I can not answer to every one individually. But I already read most of them and here are some general thoughts:
- USD is not a stable coin in itself. A stable coin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a fiat currency. USD is a fiat currency. Electronic banking etc. is NOT the same as a cryptocurrency.
- I get that it's hard to have trust in the fed. But that trust is required if you use USD (or any stable coin pegged to USD) anyways, right?
- I guess much depends on how such a currency would look. If the fed created an actual crypto and not just any virtual currency, meaning a open protocol without central authority, trust in the fed would not really be needed to use that coin. Just like you don't need to trust Satoshi (or even know their identity) to use and trust bitcoin, right?

CryptoCurrency,"If you didn't experience 2014 or 2018, look at the terraluna reddit as an example","Terra has given us a unique microcosm into what true capitulation looks like, and the emotions and posts there very clearly mirror the lowest lows of crypto winter last cycle. If you're wondering how you will feel if this bear market continues for 3-12 months, go look at their reddit. That's how you'll feel. 

What makes this part of the cycle feel different is that over leveraged bets caused the crash after BTC hit 20k. This time, it's rising interest rates. The primary advantage we have as retail investors is that we can see the interests rates rising with decent clarity. The amount of leverage back then felt nebulous. Notice how few people blame this on whale manipulation in comparison to let time. Don't expect the lows to be as unclear as last time, since we can basically look to the NASDAQ to know where we will go day to day.",cryptocurrency,1652694215
stocks,Declining Age for the Boeing Company?,"Serious question here.

I've had the great idea to invest in this company long time ago. Since march21 there's a downturn with no signs of reversals whatsoever.

Halted 787 deliveries, delayed 77x certification and 737Max still unsolved problems.

Bitcoin,How does the tax of Bitcoin being received from gambling?,"Hey guys, I was wondering since there are more and more crypto casinos (you've probably noticed that), how are you dealing with taxes for Bitcoin, how does that work? I've never used any of this crypto gambling stuff, but I'm willing to try.   


And what's the deal with the fact that many of these crypto gambling/casino platforms are forbidden in many countries, what's the exact reason for that?  


I'm curious as well do these casinos maybe use something for data protection of their users since I learn a lot about it, I dunno am I even willing to try if I don't feel secure, I know a lot of companies use Modex or similar stuff for data protection which starts to be necessary for users to feel comfortable (yup, I'm one of these paranoid guys lol).   


As I've heard the type of tax you have to pay will depend on your income. Another interesting thing about it is that majority, use Bitcoin without paying taxes, and some even use it on purpose to not pay them. Is that really possible?   


Look at this, what I've found:  
Canada: Bitcoin tax-free gambling,  
Australia: Bitcoin tax-free gambling,  
UK: Bitcoin tax-free gambling,  
US: Gambling winnings are subject to both Federal and State Income Tax.  


Can someone pls explain to me, why in these countries users don't pay any taxes for crypto gambling?",cryptocurrency,1652699924
gaming,Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis System Patent and game dynamics that maybe invalidate said patent.,"I've always been fascinated by the patent on the Nemesis System of Warner Bros.

In this article some quick info [https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-games-nemesis-system-patent-was-approved-this-week-after-multiple-attempts](https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-games-nemesis-system-patent-was-approved-this-week-after-multiple-attempts)

Below, the first granted claim of US 10,926,179 B2:

*1. A method comprising:* 

*controlling, by a processor, game events in a computer-* 

*implemented game, the game events involving an ava-* 

*tar that is operated in response to input from a player,* 

*and a ﬁrst non-player character that is controlled by the* 

*processor to respond to and automatically oppose ava-* 

*tars based on ﬁrst character parameters deﬁned in a* 

*computer memory;* 

*detecting, by the processor, occurrence of a predeﬁned* 

*one of the game events involving an interaction* 

*between the avatar and the ﬁrst non-player character;* 

*changing, by the processor, second character parameters* 

*deﬁned in at least one of the computer memory or a* 

*second computer memory for control of a second* 

*non-player character in the game based on the detect-* 

*ing, wherein the second non-player character is con-* 

*trolled by the processor to respond to and automatically* 

*oppose avatars based on the second character param-* 

*eters deﬁned in the at least one of the computer memory* 

*or the second computer memory; and* 

*outputting, to an output device, an indication of the* 

*second character parameters that are changed by the* 

*changing.*

Being myself a patent lawyer (not in the US), and a bit of a gamer sometime, this first claim seems to me definitely not new as its scope of protection is really huge and seems to cover well estabilished game dynamics.

To parafrase the claim, you have a first NPC fighting you, after some event happens to the first NPC, a second NPC changes and then is available to fight you. Finally there is an output that shows you that the second character has changed. This is it (according to a very quick study).

I've been playing a bit in my life and I think I remember quite a few instances of boss battles in which you have two enemies fighting at the same time. If you defeat the first one, the second one gets buffed and extra angry at you. Usually some music, or light show, or some cut scene, allows you to appreciate and realize that change to the second boss has happened. This to me already seems a game dynamic that should be covered by the claim 1, but being an age old dynamic it may actually invalidate the patent.

Does anyone has some specific examples? I just know the dynamic but I don't remember specific examples.

The patent has a March 26 2015 priority, so any example should be from before 2015.

I'm seeking advice as to what I should focus on next. I have a fully funded emergency fund, $8,900 in checking, and all debt paid off besides a very low interest rate auto loan, and money I owe to repay my parents for college expenses:

personalfinance,I haven't saved for retirement at 37,"**EDITED TO ADD:**

Thank you, everyone, for all your sound advice! After work today, I spent some time working on my budget and looking at what I could realistically save, and I think I can max out a 401K and Roth IRA. With the employer match, I should get pretty close to 30%. I'm still deciding on how best to tackle the federal student loans. The highest interest rate is 4.5%.

**ORIGINAL POST:**

For some context, I made some very poor financial choices from the get-go. I went out-of-state for college, borrowed a bunch of money in student loans (both federal and private), switched my major a couple times, and ended up in school for 8 years effectively. After school, I got a job relevant to my field and jumped around a few times to increase my income.

However, with my increased income, I had immense lifestyle creep and ended up getting myself into some really bad credit card debt. I finally enrolled in a DMP (debt management program) 6 years ago to help me pay it off. I also managed to pay off my private student loans, but I still have about $100K in federal loans left. I just made my last DMP payment today, and I feel like I can finally breathe.

I don't have a car payment (that was also being paid off the last 6 years), but I have a mortgage that's about $1300/month. I earn about $100K annually. I probably could earn more if I left my current company, but they have great benefits and offered me stability while I was paying off my debt.

The only benefit I didn't take advantage of was the 401K employer match of 4%. I'm kicking myself right now because that could have been a hefty amount. I barely have any savings because I was so focused on paying off my student loans and debt.

I've sat down to do a budget, but I'm not sure what my plan of attack is for saving for retirement. What do I do now? I feel so behind.",finance,1652709470

CryptoCurrency,Do you think Governments / Federal Banks creating stable coins would be good or bad overall for crypto?,"First, I know shit about fuck. 

Second, I am on the fence about govs creating stable coins. I generally love the ethos of decentralized crypto (not all crypto is centralized), and I generally don’t trust the government to do what is best for the masses (over what is best for the lobbying banks). However, I also recognize that mass adoption and truly changing the financial system will probably not happen without some regulation and the Fed’s of the world getting involved somehow to help create stability…the sheeple populous will just not adopt crypto unless their leaders tell them it’s safe to. 

The cons (I can think of) are obviously it will give governments more control. To swap any crypto to their stable coin you bet your ass there would lots of KYC. It will allow for better tracking of capital gains. It will make ‘stable coins’ susceptible to the same issues fiat has. Probably more? 

There are a few pros, but the one I am focused on would be: it could help ‘legitimize’ crypto in the minds of the masses (we on this board already think it’s legit) and that would lead to more investment, and adoption into the space. 

Two things (that I can think of) that would make me definitely against it is if 1. Crypto coins have to meets some type of standard in order to be swapped with a gov backed stable coin. This would just be a convenient way for the government to control crypto projects and standards. 
2. The government backed coins could only be traded on a centralized exchange or kept in a government backed wallet. 

I am sure there are other reasons why this could be good or bad, so I wanted to open it up to the community to get their thoughts.",cryptocurrency,1652713579

personalfinance,"Unexpected $8,000 dental work ahead","Long-time listener, first-time caller... Thank you everyone for your knowledgeable advice as I've lurked here during the pandemic. Your guidance has given me the confidence to try and get in a financial position to get a mortgage and it's totally working! I pray that my medical needs won't screw up all my gains...

I'm about 1.5 years into my credit build. My fico score has gone from no score/568-ish to the current 698 - 709 with TU, Exp., and Equifax.

I've always paid cash/debit card for everything, never wanted to buy a home, and always saved up and paid cash for my used cars. I'm 57 now and am hoping to get a mortgage for a 2 to 4-unit building (live in one unit and rent others) in 1 to 2 years. I'd like to buy the building I live in.

**I have a very thin, young credit file.** My only credit card is a Chase Freedom Unlimited that I got in mid-Feb. of **this year**... Chase offered me the card in their banking app and I jumped on it. I've banked with them for 9 years with a checking account and savings account. (Chases Credit Journey gives me a credit score of 714). I also have a checking and savings account with Ally Bank - those accounts are about 6 years old.

I proudly live modestly. I take excellent care of my 14-year-old Honda that I paid cash for 8 years ago. My rent is $750. ...Cell phone is with Google Fi (for 5-ish years) and work hard to keep the bill around $23-$26. Bought a used (of course) Pixel 5 from Swappa... My income is about $47,000. Employed full-time with multiple side hustles. Pre-Pandemic it was closer to $50,000 and rising. I walk to work. Single female no kids. No one to give me a loan/bail me out. I live in very rural Maine. The nearest Chase Bank branch is in New Hampshire and is about a 3 hour's drive. I would have to take a day off from work to visit a branch. I bank exclusively online.

My Chase Freedom Unlimited is used carefully for things like groceries, utilities, insurance, gas, and auto repair/maintenance. I pay it weekly and keep utilization by the statement date below 10%. It's paid in full by the due date. CL is $1500. I was planning to get another card around Feb. 2023. I was also planning on getting a credit-building installment loan when my credit score was high enough so it didn't have to be a **secured** loan.

I have health and dental insurance. I recently dropped a metal stool on my face and will need $6000 - $8000 dental work over the next 10 months. My Dental insurance will only cover about $1000 of it. I expect to be billed as the work gets done thru monthly visits starting in late June. The Dentist's Office says the bills will be between $1000 - $2200 each month. I don't anticipate being able to pay in full with cash and credit each month. My Chase FU has 0 interest until May 2023 and that will help. I would love to keep my credit utilization low. I don't think that's possible.

My job is secure. My savings is growing but only sit's around $1000. I hope to not have to spend all of it on this dental journey.

I considered requesting a credit limit increase from Chase but the card is so new that I'm afraid that the hard pull will result in a denial. I have two hard pulls on my profile - Chase in Feb. for the CFU and a local Credit Union from when I inquired about a credit-building loan in March.

I've clicked through all the pre-quals I can find online and prequalified for Discover IT cash back, Discover it Gas &amp; Restaurants... Capital One: Quicksilver Rewards, SavorOne Rewards, Platnium Mc... no approval from Amex or Wells Fargo... Chase hasn't offered me any new cards thru their app but that's not shocking as the current card is only 3 months young. Amazon prequalified me for the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card.

I hope to get a **cashback card with no interest intro rate for at least a year with the highest limit** that I can hope for. I would consider an annual fee card if the fee was waived for the first year. I would plan to product change after the first year to a No Fee card.

I know this post is way. to. long. Sorry for that. Since you're still here... I'll add that 10 years ago I gave up a very high-paying job that I had in a major US city for 20 years. I paid cash for everything but life was big, loud, and stressful. I spent it all - to keep up with the pace and cost of doing business. I was often the only woman in the room. I had a blast and the work was almost impossible but I was young and eager. I loved it until I didn't. I gave it up for a physically and mentally healthier life and it has been marvelous. I don't really miss the city but any financial opportunities I have now are limited to rural country life.

Any recommendations that you have are greatly appreciated. I would consider a personal loan if the interest rate was low/acceptable. Going to Mexico for dental work won't work for me. Going to a dental school would be ok for a small portion of what is needed, but would be about a 2 hour drive in both directions. Not ideal.

This forum has been so helpful and educational! I never would have even started to try at this late date in life but for you all! Much respect and gratitude...",finance,1652716313

personalfinance,First Time Solo Home Buyer. Want to make Sure I’m not over looking anything from a Budget Perspective,"I know these posts can get somewhat long winded so I’ll try and keep it as factual as possible and ask my questions at the end. Feel free to ask for any additional clarification and I’ll try and provide. Currently looking at houses in my area. 3 bedrooms, 1-2 bathrooms, ideally finished basement and yard for dog. Current price range 175-230k. Interest rates around 5.4% 

Edit: add fixed 30 year

##Income 
- just me (35) and a dog. $80,000 USD pre tax
- 8-12% bonus annually in addition - should be noted for budget and mortgage calculations I am only using the 80,000 base. Bonus is treated as just that.

##Debts
- none 
- Student loans have been taken care of for awhile
- Car 2012 has been paid off for a few years and only 75k miles as minimal commutes previously and now 4/5 days WFH. However I have been continuing to auto roll $300 for car payment into Savings since car has been paid off as a combo of house/car future down payment 

##Savings 
- 40k set aside for eventual house down payment
- 140k in 401k. Currently contributing 15% per pay and company matches 50% of first 7%

##Budget 
- used 50/30/20 rule but did not add back in 401k contributions as I wanted budget based on actual take home pay with no intention to alter contributions downward. Below figures are based off me going through last two months of bills which are pretty consistent. Can get more granular if requested.

- monthly take home pay (bi weekly - so 2x 3 pay months not accounted for) after deductions - $3700

-Necessities (50%) / $1856 - this is currently under as my rent is only $750, so with that and utilities, phone, insurance, dog care etc. I’m currently coming in around $1,250 a month. But with expected mortgage and that close to doubling it climbs to closer to $2,300 which is over but I believe it’s offset by next section

- Wants (30%) / $1,100
- this is kind of the weird section as honestly I don’t need much other than a few meals out and some frivolous impulse shopping here and there. Between my subscriptions which total about $40 a month and a $200 entertainment budget I’m sitting at $250 of the $1100 which creates a pretty significant surplus which is almost furthered by the next section

- Savings (20%) / $750
- so I know this section usually is 401k investments which I don’t really account for here since I never added it back in to risk avoiding increasing the previous categories.
- this entire section is currently budgeted to preemptively eliminate debt, build up a house repair/payment fund
- current intended breakdown 
- $300 continued car payment allotment/repairs
- $300 house savings (possibly applied to mortgage as needed)
- $150 a month additional payment towards mortgage principal 

##Questions
So hopefully that gave enough information to answer the below questions
- I know I’m over on the necessities when it comes to the mortgage but considering low wants and non spoken for savings is that going to be an issue? Current calculations have mortgage at around $1350 per month after insurance and taxes.
- should I be concerned with climbing interest rates and/or ride out my existing lower rent and wait for a correction? I’ve heard mixed ideas on whether one is even coming. Or okay at current rate/market and refinance later?
- Semi unrelated but should I be allocating extra funds any differently?
- I feel like I have my ducks in a row budget wise and it seems to check out, but was hoping to get the subs more informed and unbiased opinion on the matter and make sure I wasn’t telling myself any lies.
- Any other words of wisdom re budget or home buying experience greatly appreciated

Bitfinex has 3.3 Billion dollars being loaned out while the interest rate showing on their website is over 30%. This is definitely a huge red flag for  Bitfinex stablecoin. If tether had any funds they would take this 30% rate for themselves instead of their ""commercial paper"".

They are also likely using futures and margin exchanges to short all crypto pairs against BTC since this will give them extra loans although they will come at a cost. But they are willing to pay 30-50% losses for these loans.

eg. If they need USD right away and dont mind losing money long term if the trade goes against them , what they can do is short all pairs against Bitcoin , which causes market makers to sell those coins for USD, then use those dollars to buy Bitcoin and switch the bitcoin for more of the original crypto than they started with (again this is paper crypto, on futures and margin accounts, when the position is close the crypto will be purchased off the market/ or cash settled). But the position could be open for months, or even rerolled indefinitely unless they go bankrupt and get force liquidated.

We have no debt. We have retirement money put away, $15k in brokerage accounts that are currently in the red and about $35k cash saved for a down payment.

We’re first time homebuyers and competition in our price range is huge.

Putting 5% down on a 2 bed condo/townhome in the $350k range with HOA fees will give us around a $2,500/mo payment, give or take a couple hundred. SFH just really aren’t an option in our price range and new builds are out of our range too. I think we could rent a 1 bed for about $1,500/mo for the next year. 

My biggest fear with not buying now is we save up another $20k+ for a down payment but housing prices and interest rates continue to rise and we’re worse off than we are now.

Mileage is about 15k under the lease terms mostly due to WFH transitions.

personalfinance,Possible to get rid of this car or a bad idea?,"I recently purchased a used car(from a more recent year so it was more expensive than a full on beater car). Due to not having any real help from people I know, it was near impossible to even get out to even check out sales, private or at dealerships, so I ended up in a position where I got rushed into getting a car I wasn't exactly crazy about. I had to take out a loan to do it, and currently am paying high interest due to having no credit history and thus no credit score. I originally planned to keep my payments up to be able to refinance and get a lower interest rate. However I am realizing I'm not really liking how this car drives, and was wondering if it would be possible to trade this car in or something, and take out another loan to get a different car? I realize it would be more expensive(especially if the new car costs more than what this current one does), and likely put me into more debt, but could it be done? I wasn't sure if my bank would allow it even after improving my credit score from doing the payments on the current one. Also would it be a really bad idea to do this, or have other people done this before and not had too much issues with it? Curious both how difficult it is to do, and if it's even a good idea or potentially disastrous or something. I'd be resolved to just pay for however long for a new car if it's one i truly like and want.",finance,1652733141

I love playing games on their hardest or second hardest difficulties because i love to use everything the game has to offer and i just dont feel like it is necessary to do so on normal or easy mode.

But in this case i switched to easy because even with every trick i can think of this game feels wierdly hard. every enemy onehits me and i do zero dmg no matter what i do. I found myself being 10 lvl above the recommendation for the quest i am doing and still feeling super weak. I dont know how to handle those enemies and ripping off their parts doesnt do anything for me. All the machines are super aggressive and the only way to dodge their attacks seems to be rolling into them because all attacks are following me with 5-10 seconds of the animation being a hit. Finally all fights are against at least 4 enemies wich wont stop to attack, closing the openings of each other, making me roll almost the entire fight not letting me aim or stack elemental effects.

Am i the only one beeing completly fed up with this? I like the challenge but it doesnt feel hard, just annoying. do you have any advice for me to make it challenging and more strategic instead of rolling 24/7 and turn my enemies into arrow hedghogs?",technology,1652734197

personalfinance,Talked out of re-fi by salesperson,"I recently contacted my mortgage loan servicer regarding refinancing in order to remove PMI. Three years ago I signed for an FHA loan for 420k at 2.5%. Roughly 400k left on the loan. The house appreciated from 420k to 600k. While the mortgage is only 1600, I have 400 in PMI and 400 in insurance/taxes for a total just shy of $2400/month. I was hoping I could refinance for a slightly worse rate and drop the PMI off of the loan since I now have more than enough equity. I would even take 15-25k out for new windows/siding because I'll need to replace those in the next 5-10 years regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

While I already plan on increasing my payment to more than originally set; the goal was to reduce the monthly payment while the term stays the same. That way I could have that much more of the payment going towards the principal each month.

&amp;#x200B;

The salesperson was convinced I'm better off sticking with my current interest rate instead of taking off PMI; and, in turn, convinced me that if my goal was to save money, that paying more on top of $2400/month to eat away at the principal was my best bet. They said I'd probably have a monthly payment of $2600/month if we went thru with a re-fi right now. Was I placated here? Can I have my PMI and eat it too?",finance,1652736710

personalfinance,Past due balance at the university for a second time and loan disbursements?,"I’m currently in a situation where I need to pay off a past due balance to the school.

This past academic year (2021-22) I received significantly less aid than I did the year prior, and my out-of-pocket cost nearly tripled. I was able to make the first payment on the payment plan back in the fall but quickly fell off because I could not afford it as a full-time student. I tried applying for loans and scholarships and was in a really tight spot. By the end of the fall semester, I owed $4,500 and was locked out to register for the spring semester.

Because I’m an out-of-state student who is completely responsible for taking care of myself at college, I faced the risk of being homeless by the start of the spring semester. This was because I wasn’t registered for classes which made me ineligible to stay in the dorms and the student accounts office refused to lift the registration hold with a past due balance. After being annoyingly persistent, they shared that if I could get a parent to fill out a parent plus loan from the fed government and get denied, I’d receive $4,000 in additional aid (fed loans). But, to receive it they’d have to lift the hold and enroll me in the spring. Yay! Problem solved, right? No.

The fed government only disburses loans equally between both fall and spring. So only $2,000 came off the fall past due balance and the other half would be applied to my spring balance ($6,000). By the end of the spring semester, I would have originally had a balance of $6,300. But, after working my ass off to get $2,000 paid off, the balance is now down to $4,300. I shared with them that I'd be able to pay off an additional $1,500 by the end of the summer with my new internship and even showed them the offer letter for proof. But now I’m back in the same position as before with a past due balance and I NEED to register. Otherwise, I lose my internship which pays the bills and my graduation date gets pushed back.

I moved off campus to reduce the bill that I’d owe the University after finally finding a place that’s way cheaper. Since my family’s income hasn’t changed, I’d actually be owed a refund in the form of loan disbursement based on my EFC after filling out FAFSA and intended to use that loan money to pay them back. But, the loans won’t even be released to the school unless I’m enrolled, and they’ve refused to lift the hold.

I know they already did it once and it might be crazy to ask again, but this time I finally have a tangible way to pay them back. My refund will be twice the amount I currently owe, and my other scholarships cover the entire cost of tuition and fees, so it’s not like I’d owe them again for the upcoming term - I’d finally get caught up.

As a side note, believe me - I’ve already tried everything. Cosigned loans with parents have been denied, parent plus loan was also denied, and I’m constantly applying for scholarships. I could work until I could pay it off but my internship is my source of income and without being enrolled in college, I’ll get kicked out of the program. Would it be impossible to get them to agree to lift it? I told them I’d fill out any necessary paperwork to authorize them to apply the loan disbursement to my balance first.

For context, I (F22) work 38 hrs a week and make roughly 2000/month.. I have 4000 saved and 2000 in a ROTH. I go to community college and will transfer to a cal state in the spring of 2023. I’m aiming to get my degree in accounting and get my CPA.

My current situation

Car: 
I drive a 2004 Toyota Sienna with 285,000+ miles on it… my nparents gave me the car “to help me” but in reality the value of the car (according to Kelly blue books, is only 750 bc of damage) is significantly lower than the amount of repairs the car needs (~1600)… I could take the bus but because my shift typically ends at 11 and the area I live isn’t the safest, I would prefer to drive..

My credit score is low because I just started building credit with a credit card in January. I pay my rent/insurance/credit card (never spend more than 500/month on it) on time, and have been able to build it up to 688. However, when I went to the credit union, my credit score still shows up as 0, so the minimum interest rate i would qualify for is 15%. Also, to buy a car through the credit union, the car can not be older than ten years and must be from either a site like car max or a brand name dealership (honda, Toyota, etc)..

School:
I’m stressed out because I also go to community college and I’d have to pay 300 for the summer and ~700 for fall… but once I transfer, it’ll go up to approximately 7000+ a semester, and I’d inevitably have to take out a loan. I don’t qualify for any financial aid yet since I’ll only be 23 when I transfer, but hopefully once I’m 24, I can finally get aid as an independent.

Living situation:
I don’t live at home bc of family issues.. I was able to rent for a really, really, really good deal at 300/month bc of a friend, but my lease ends in August.. my budget for rent per month is approx 700/month.

Am I doing something wrong? Is there a logical solution to this? Any and all advice would be **greatly** appreciated.",finance,1652749374

So, I  wanted to fly my plan by some more knowledgeable folkx to see how dumb I am and if we have any chance of reaching our financial goals. I've included numbers below (all in USD). Any advice is most appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Financial Goals

* Own a small home in the woods (hopefully, rural Canada, British Columbia). 1 bedroom and 2 offices would be great.
* Provide our two dogs a decent quality of life (no plans for children, seems too expensive).
* Retire around 60? My spouse and I like our jobs but I imagine after 30 years we'll be slowing down...
* Maybe provide some free temporary housing for folkx down on their luck if we somehow have extra income. Maybe by building tiny homes on the land?

Doctoral Program Cost

* $84k over 3 years, Doctorate of Social Work (DSW). I'd be working during the program.
* ROI: Low. Maybe I could start teaching? I have a master's degree already and could feasibly teach with that currently though. Typically an MSW is treated as a terminal degree in this field. So it really would be something for the love of learning and learning skills to better serve my community.

Income

* I'm married, 29 years old, and I make between $80-100k per year (I have my own business, I'm a mental health therapist).
* My spouse is 28 and makes around $40k per year (they have their own business, tutor, no plans for further education).

Cash on Hand

* $\~8000

Debt

* $61k of student loans (all federal, mix of unsubsidized and subsidized)

Major Expenses

* Rent - $1600 per month
* Health Insurance - $\~600 per month
* Groceries - $\~400 per month
* Miscellaneous expenses (mostly business expenses): $\~150 per month
* Phone Plan: $80 per month
* Comcast: $60 per month
* Car insurance/Renters Insurance - $114 per month",finance,1652758575

A friend who helped me with my house says I should take the 5.5% since I’m planning to sell in about 2-3 years anyway. He said even if I don’t sell my credit will be better and I could refinance instead, maybe even sooner. He also said that since my out of pocket on the 5.5% deal is only ~$4k it’s not much of a “loss”.

stocks,Inflation is a blank check against the economy. There can be no turnaround until it's controlled.,"There have been a lot of opinions offered on when we might see the selling stop, but it really all comes down to one issue: inflation.  

Inflation is a blank check against the US economy.  It gives the Fed complete power to slow the economy until it can get inflation controlled.  Until investors know what that looks like, they can't possibly make any confident forecasts about the future earnings of companies.  

Let me use an analogy.  You're about to click buy on a big fat engagement ring when your girlfriend texts you at 11 PM on a Monday night and says she wants to talk.  It sounds serious.  Do you buy the ring?  Of course not!  Maybe she wants to talk about something totally unrelated to you, but maybe she met someone else or maybe she has finally thought it over and realized you don't really look that much like Ryan Reynolds.  Who knows, but you can't possibly commit to a big purchase when you don't even know if the relationship is on solid ground.

How can investors possibly know how to discount future earnings if they don't know whether the terminal rate is going to be 2% or 5% or 8%?  Those three numbers would mean very, very different things for the US economy.  It's the difference between Powell's soft-ish landing and a full-on canned tuna and reusable toilet paper recession.  

Companies would make vastly different amounts of money in those three scenarios, and until investors have some idea about what will be needed in order to control inflation, things are very unlikely to turn around.  And from where I'm sitting, we have no clue whatsoever what kind of terminal rate will be needed.  Significant portions of inflation are driven by artifical forces, like oil disruption due to Ukraine or supply chain disruption due to Covid.  This makes predicting the effects of higher rates very hard.  


My less-convicted, armchair guess:   I think we see these 1-2% weekly bleeds until the market is given clarity one way or the other.  I don't think we see any huge one-day selloffs in the near-term unless some drastic comments from Powell drop.  The next CPI report isn't until June 10, so it's hard for me to see how we have much to make big moves on for a few weeks.  If the 1-2% bleeds continue long enough, we could end up in crash territory.  We're only several months of 1-2% weekly drops away from the S&amp;P being down 40%.  So it's conceivable, and I honestly think we need some good news from actual inflation data to prevent this.",finance,1652764437

I don’t understand why anyone would buy those risky Mortage bonds if fed tries to sell them in market. We have increased recession expectations and a risk of people losing jobs possibly defaulting on their mortgages. 

Tapering can in fact expose Fed that it’s basically a dumpster of all the garbage assets in the economy. 

I think Powell understands that. His strategy seems all talk some action. Crashing the market through hawkish talks to cause mild recession which should reduce aggregate demand &amp; inflation.

Tldr: Fed doesn’t want to risk being exposed for holding garbage assets so they are bluffing the market with hawkish taper talks so it does the tightening without them having to do any serious tapering.",finance,1652767350

personalfinance,How much should I pay?,"Hey guys, I'm 21 and been working to improve my credit score and get out of CC debt after some poor 'typical' 18-20 year old decisions. Sitting at 630 right now, and first I want to ask is that bad?   


Secondly for my credit card debt, I have $1,300 on two separate cards, and $2,300 on another and they all have about the same interest rate. I have about $1,500 extra this month to help me pay some stuff. I always always pay my minimum payment on time every month, if not I pay more than the minimum. I have never missed a payment. I want to ask what should I pay on each, or should I pay one off? I am looking at either paying one of the $1,300 cards off, or reducing the $2,300 card to $800, or Paying $500 on each. Which one will improve my score the most and what do you guys suggest?   


Thank you all sincerely.",finance,1652781854

CryptoMarkets,"Bitcoin Has Failed as an Alternative Money, says Former Fed Chairman","Ben Bernanke – former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve – does not believe [Bitcoin](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin) or other cryptocurrencies can succeed as an alternative money. He claims their prices are too volatile to serve as a practical means of exchange and lack the underlying use cases to serve as stores of value.

He added that the price of groceries also regularly fluctuates against Bitcoin, further impeding its adoption as a medium of exchange. Indeed, Bitcoin’s price has seen major volatility to the downside over the past 7 weeks, breaking an all-time record for its longest weekly bearish trend on Monday.

In fact, Bernanke believes Bitcoin’s “main use” is within underground economies for facilitating illegal activity.

What is your opinion on such position?

Getting gas from remote-automated stations was easy and would not of been done with a Chip and Signature card.  Even going through airports it was always so quick.  Living in US now, I'm on the hunt for a US Bank with true chip and pin capability.  Does anyone have personal experience using/owning one and what bank did you go with? I saw PenFed had a card with this ability and a few others but interested in what people on here may use.  Thanks.

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to slowly move my emergency fund into laddered I-Bonds?,"I'd like to slowly move my emergency fund into laddered I-Bonds in order to offset the effects of inflation.

My main issue with my emergency fund is that it loses value over time due to inflation, particularly in these high inflation times. This is a pretty common concern for emergency funds. 

I recently learned about I bonds, which track inflation and are currently at a 9.62% interest rate according to Treasurydirect.gov. If I move my emergency fund into laddered I bonds, I don't have to worry about that fund losing value anymore, and still have it very accessible once a bond is 1 year old. 

Is there any downside here other than having my money tied up in bonds for a little bit while I wait out the year it takes to mature the bond? I also saw I lose 3 months interest for selling before 30 years, but that doesn't seem like a terrible tradeoff.",finance,1652801368

I'm looking to buy a house in 9'ish months and want to put my down payment money somewhere safe in the meantime. I'm considering the 26 week T-bill for \~1.5%, but also wonder if I should buy a higher yield/longer term note (e.g. 10 year note for \~2.9%) which I can sell when I need it. 

The risk to this is if interest rates go up after I purchase causing the value of the note to decrease when I want to sell, right? Do you think that risk outweighs the extra 1.4% yield? Anything else I'm missing?

Thanks for any thoughts or advice",finance,1652802626

bigdata,Microsoft AI Team Introduces “Federated Learning Utilities and Tools for Experimentation” (FLUTE): A High-Performance Open-Source Platform For Federated Learning Research And Offline Simulations,"Distributed Training (DT), which focuses on scaling the model training process via model or data parallelism, has gotten much interest because of an increase in training datasets. On the other hand, DT makes some assumptions, particularly in terms of communication and network parameters. Furthermore, new data management restrictions are arising due to the growing requirement for personal data protection, making data more inaccessible due to storage behind firewalls or on users’ devices without the option of being shared for centralized training. Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that emphasizes collaborative training and data privacy for users. The central concept underlying federated learning is that these machine learning models are highly versatile when it comes to training sophisticated models over large amounts of data without having to share that data with a centralized body. Despite its popularity as a research topic, it is challenging to deploy since it differs significantly from typical machine learning pipelines. Local data variety, end-node hardware diversity, privacy concerns, and optimization limits are challenges in federated learning. Furthermore, federated learning applications frequently need to extend the learning process to millions of clients to imitate a real-world environment. These difficulties highlight the necessity for a simulation platform that allows researchers and developers to conduct proof-of-concept implementations and verify performance before creating and deploying their machine learning models.

personalfinance,Best way to borrow $60k?,"I need $60k for emergency home repairs. Home insurance is not an option. I have a good job and capable of paying my debts. Which of the following would be the best way to borrow this money?

1. Refinance and use equity from home. 
2. Home equity line of credit (HELOC)
3. Borrow from 401k
4. Personal loan from family (if so what interest rate would be fair for both parties)

Edit for those curious: “emergency” may have been too strong of a word. Pool is cracked and needing repair, need some roof repairs, and need to pour a new driveway after some sewer repair.",finance,1652805305
personalfinance,Is there a way to take advantage of a low interest auto loan?,"I don't plan on taking any more debt, but I have an auto loan with a 2.5% interest rate and was wondering if there was a way to leverage that for anything? It'd be nice if I could use that to somehow get a personal line of credit fixed at that rate to have instead of an emergency fund, or to get a personal loan with that rate in the future to partially offset a mortage at a lower rate.

I guess I'm asking if there is any way to get a company to match interest rates across different loan types?",finance,1652806364
personalfinance,Paying off Mortgage Early when stock market growth is less than Interest Rate?,"It is commonly recommended to not pay off a mortgage early, and instead put additional money into the stock market, because mortgage interest rates are often lower than stock market growth over the long term.

Does this advice change when we are in a market correction like we are now?

For example, if a homeowner inherited a large amount of money during a bear market, would it be sensible to pay off the remaining principal on a mortgage in order to minimize the interest payments over the life of the loan?",finance,1652806853
Bitcoin,Please Explain - Bitcoin mining drives miners to the place where energy is the cheapest,"I've listened to Saifedean Ammous now on two podcasts whose made this claim, similarly Michael Saylor has made this claim in other podcasts, however I'm still struggling to understand it and I haven't found much literature on the topic. 

Saifedean says bitcoin does not need to buy energy from places where there is high demand because it can buy it from anywhere. I understand that miners will set up shop where energy is low cost because it means they will increase their return on the bitcoins they've mined. 

Yet the way Michael and Saifedean talk about it, it sounds like they are inferring you can have a bitcoin miner in the North Pole somehow hooked into an energy source in the Sahara through an internet connection.  But surely your mining rigs would have to be set up in the place your extracting the electricity from? 

The fact that Bitcoin drives miners to places where energy is cheapest I believe is seriously undervalued because it could drive innovation in energy production in renewables at time when energy is costing us significantly more financially and environmentally than ever before.  

I believe this should be one of the things Bitcoin is shouting about and a lot of people in the Finance industry have overlooked. 

Anyway, my interpretation could be way off so I wanted to come here to see if one of the pros could explain in detail what they mean please? 

Also makes me wonder if Satoshi had considered this second order effect when designing bitcoin or if it was purely serendipitous",cryptocurrency,1652807658

personalfinance,Collections charging $600 on a medical debt of $1200,"Hi there! I am going to make this as short as possible:

A medical provider incorrectly billed my insurance in 2019 as out of network, and by the time I received a collections letter in 2022, it's too late to have them rebill it. So at this time I'm responsible for the $1,200 outstanding. However, the Collections agency is now charging $600 interest so the total is $1,800. Is there a limit to what they can collect?

The original document I signed had this clause, not necessarily with a % interest rate or fee associated:

&amp;#x200B;

""In the event that I have received and cashed the reimbursement check or checks, litigation will ensue and I will be subjected to collection by an outside collection agency or small claims court or civil court. In that case I will be responsible for the total fee submitted to my insurance company (that may exceed the actual reimbursement check) and will include any legal fees incurred as a result.”

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice at all? I just want to pay this to get them off my back, but I don't want to pay the extra $600 for fees, which really isn't my fault.. Thank you so much in advance for any advice.

personalfinance,Piggyback Mortgage Options with Rising HELOC Rate,"With the Fed set on increasing rates short term to combat inflation, I'm looking at options to address my rising HELOC rate.

&amp;#x200B;

General Information:

* **First Mortage** \- 30-year conventional at 3.25%. $540k balance
* **Second Mortgage (HELOC)** \- 30-year variable rate. Started at 4.49%, currently 5.24% 
   * 10-year draw period. 20-year repayment period
   * $119k balance 
   * Variable rate is Prime Rate + 1.24% 
   * Interest-only payments have risen from $420/month to $500/month 
   * According to the HELOC terms, the rate will never go lower than the original 4.49% and is capped at a maximum of 18%
* **Home Value** \- Would likely appraise for $800k

&amp;#x200B;

Additional Info:

The only other debt I have is a $250/month student loan payment, which will be paid off in August of this year. My original goal was to pay off the HELOC by the end of the 10-year draw period. I have budgeted $1,350 per month to pay down the principal + the original $420/month in interest. However, with the rising interest rate, this may no longer be feasible.

&amp;#x200B;

Options I'm Exploring:

* **Cash-out/Deb-consolidation** \- Redo first and second mortgage into one 30-year conventional loan
   * Pros: Rate locked-in for 30 years. No HELOC
   * Cons: Rate will be much higher than my current 3.25%, and likely put me in Jumbo rate territory. Will likely pay more in interest over the life of the new loan. Possibility of having to pay PMI if my house does not appraise for $800k (Combined loans are $660k). Additional closing costs.
* **401k Loan** \- Take out the $50k max and immediately pay down the HELOC.
   * Pros: Currently in a down market. Interest is paid back into my 401k
   * Cons: Risk of losing job (currently stable). Risk of market rebounding and missing out on additional gains
   * Unknowns: Repayment terms. If I can still contribute to my 401k in addition to paying off the loan. My 401k is fully Roth - unsure how that is handled from a repayment perspective.
* **Stop Funding Roth 401k**
   * Pros: Use the additional \~$1k per month to pay down the HELOC faster
   * Cons: Sacrifice retirement savings
* **Do Nothing** \- Eat the rate hikes. Continue to pay $1,350 per month. Snowball the $250/month student loan payment into further paying down the HELOC
   * Pros: None of the Cons from the other options
   * Cons: Paying more in interest
   * Unknowns: How high will the Fed raise the interest rate
* **Convert HELOC to Fixed-Rate Home Equity Loan**
   * Pros: Hedges against further rate hikes
   * Cons: Would likely be locked in at a higher rate than the current HELOC rate of 5.24%. Would immediately be required to make principal + interest payments - no flexibility.
   * Unknowns: Unsure if this is even an option due to having 2 mortgages

Are there any other options available? Am I overthinking this? Leaning towards doing nothing and taking the $250/month payment and applying that to the HELOC, but my concern with this approach is how high will the Fed increase the rates.",finance,1652815999
personalfinance,Move back home? Or renew at my discounted apartment?,"Can y’all just give me opinions, I’m stressed af!

So I can’t decide if I should move back in with my parents, or renewal my apartment at a discounted price?

I’m 24 year old man, content creator, and trainer, currently living almost month by month purposely, but with a good savings/broker account of $35k.

My apartment renewal would currently be $1,228, and the price it is going for right now without renewal is $1,768.

But don’t know how bad this market crash/ Recession if one will be, seems pretty scary!

I don’t want to be with parents forever, I would prob stay till winter months hoping rent would drop like usual but with market conditions and interest rates rising I’m not sure that it will….i really don’t want to get stuck there for a full year and half, even though I would save tons of $$$. 

Even with a roommate I would be paying $900 individually and I like alone space.

APARTMENT RENEWAL: july to august
Pros: 800sqft, privacy, having a better social life, alone time, better mentality, private work environment and amenities to shoot content at which I currently generate a decent amount $500/mo from content creation here.
Cons: paying rent, worried about moving out in summer again with high summer prices. Stuck in a lease for 13mo.

MOVING WITH PARENTS: hopefully prices will drop some during winter.
Pros: free housing/less money stress, closer to family &amp; im the good child lol, some free food. 
Cons: smaller room, evil sister, less privacy, less social life, content creation will be hard due to not having privacy or a apartment gym.

If anyone has any ideas, I’m very indecisive and have bad anxiety when it comes to decisions! Would be grateful for just opinions???",finance,1652817024
vet,Grieving my Sadie pup,"Sadie was days away from turning 9 before she was euthanized. She was a flat coat retriever (I believe) and she was just so beautiful. 

Sadie ALWAYS breathed heavy. And she never barked. So we always considered her breathing to be her way of communicating. However near the end of her life we noticed it was more of a struggle for her. 

Sadie had an autoimmune disorder a few years prior where her white blood cells would attack her red blood cells. So by nature, the loss of blood made her weak and tired. We treated her with steroids and in two weeks she was better than ever. The vet said it was lifelong and she’d likely relapse, but it never happened. 

Last April when her breathing was getting weird and she started showing similar symptoms, I thought maybe it was the autoimmune relapsing. But after a few days of steroids she just got rapidly worse. Her breed is known for dying around 8-10 but likely 8 due to cancer. She had a cancerous looking growth on her paw that grew rapidly within the year, so it all started to make sense that it was the inevitable cancer. 

At a fast decline she suddenly stopped walking. She could only lay down. This was the worst I ever saw her and that’s when I knew we’d be saying goodbye soon. We called the vet over and over but no one could take us without an appointment, not even the hospital because they were so busy. I asked if anything is going on right now and they confirmed that no, there is no trend in patients. So we made an appointment. 

We had all her favorite friends and family come say goodbye to her before her evening appointment. She laid there motionless while we all pet her, and when the time came, we put her in the wagon and went to the vet. My husband, parents, brother and I surrounded her on the floor and pet her while we said goodbye. 

The reason I’m writing is because after obsessively looking at dog posts, it has me wondering: maybe she actually had this or that. Maybe I didn’t do enough. Maybe she was paralyzed only temporary. Maybe I could have fixed it. Truth is, I couldn’t afford any diagnosis or treatment. And my heart knew it was time. But still I feel so guilty like I cut her life short. 

We had family dogs before, but Sadie was MY first dog. I bought her. I raised her. I took her with me. I paid her bills and fed her. She was my little girl. She was my best friend when I needed one. She was my protector on lonely car rides. She helped me exercise. She was there through two suicidal attempts and comforted me when I was diagnosed with bipolar. I feel so lost and empty without her and it still doesn’t feel real. I just feel so guilty for not even diagnosing or trying to help her. I feel like I just let her go and I hate it.",cryptocurrency,1652822090

personalfinance,Selling our car to get out of debt.,"Just wanted a little reassurance. I'm sure I'm doing the right thing, but just wanted some outside perspective.

Me and my wife have been married 4.5 years, we have a 1.5 year old. Our daughter was due in December of 2020, so we purchased a new Hyundai SUV for 6.5k below MSRP + 8k down including trading in her car for 2k. Our vehicle situation at the time was a 2004 large SUV and a 2013 small sedan. We were new parents and the anxiety of our new baby didn't like the idea of a 20 yr old suv. So we bought it, for a great price and low interest rate. Everything was fine, this time last year we had like 5-6k total credit card debt, most of it being 0% interest. 

Then daycare started. And my wife's PPD ramped up. And her coping method was buying clothes for our baby. Long story short, it took a while for me to get through, but once she stopped breastfeeding she started coming back to reality. We've since been much better with our budget but the damage is done. We have like 20k in credit card debt right now. And my 2 cards are maxed. Disclaimer, I only had them to about 50-60% and they lowered the limit on them which brought them to be maxed out. Either way, I do NOT want to open another credit card to kick this can further down the road. We make pretty good money but the interest of these cards is creeping up on 400/month alone. The car is $400 with insurance. But the big thing is it's value. Dealership is offering $28k, we owe 17.   

Plan is to take $10k and pay off 2 cards(one small 0%, one of my maxed cards). I'm just looking to free up cashflow at this point. This will free up $250 from the cards and then the obvious $400 for the car. 

A few months ago a family member gave us a free 2014 sedan with low mileage because they are awesome. So we have 3 cars currently. One large SUV, one medium SUV and a sedan. Sell the medium suv, I drive the sedan, she drives the large SUV. Now that our baby is older, we're less anxious about this SUV being ""unsafe."" It's in great shape for it's age too. We'll spend $150 more in gas every month, but we'll still be coming out ahead by $500 each month immediately. Well then finally have breathing room and can start aggressively paying down the remaining debt.

My only concern? We got a really good deal on this new SUV. It gets great gas mileage(30+). It's one of the largest in it's class. We only owe $17k and then would just outright own it. 

My final take: it's a bad decision to sell the car, but unfortunately the only decision right now due to credit card interest. We need the lack of car payment to pay off debt. The fact we're getting the same price we paid for it 1.5 years later helps.

Like I said... It's a pretty cut and dry scenario, just need reassurance. I've never had credit card debt like this so I'm a bit annoyed/sad about it all.

**House:** Mortgage with roughly 150K equity, 2.75% 30 Year fixed mortgage, $1,650 a month payment (currently renting a room for 1K a month but will likely make them leave 2023).

**All other assets:** $235,000 cash, free and clear, in bank account.

**My question and issue is, what do I do?**

I don't feel safe with interest rates rising (inflation hedges don't work), with inflation at 8-10% holding cash is bad and markets in a bear market could be worse than holding cash. I don't know what the best move is in terms of setting myself up for success, but having this kind of cash at this age, is probably a gift.

**Given my situation above:**

I would like to NOT work my full-time job and would honestly be fine doing other random work (pizza delivery, other driving tasks, etc), but the money is too good at the day job to leave. And at 33 years old, do I really need to quit? I could probably work here for another 2-3 years and save a lot more money, plus get full equity and that would be worth 2-500K if all goes well easily.

Dump 250K into IEP? It is paying 15% so... 35K a year in dividends...

CryptoCurrency,A Crypto Reversal is on the cards.,"Last year in November everyone including myself was making sweet gains in crypto and then the “experts” were predicting a 100k Bitcoin, 
10k Eth etc. 

And since then we have come down a lot as you know. 

Now that the fed is raising interest rates which is making the dollar stronger for the time being but I don’t think it will last. 

Majority of trade is in USD and this annoys alot of foreign countries as whenever something political happens in the US the foreign currency is affected and can be worth significantly less when they trade the USD back into there native currency. 

My point here is I don’t think the USD will remain as strong as it is at the moment and it will begin to reverse and devalue against BTC. 

Possibly giving rise to a new global power currency, possibly the Yuan but who knows. 

Ray Dalio has spoke a lot about this potential new world order. 

Now I think this ties in with why should we always listen to the so called experts. 

Now these experts are saying we are going lower which is possible ofcourse but I wouldn’t be surprised we see a reverse to the upside in Bitcoin and goes against what they are saying again just like in November last year. 

Adding to that is the amount of short positions in crypto at the moment as people are expecting a move lower just a small reversal up and we will see a nice squeeze. 

Not financial advice ofcourse but I can’t help but buy more crypto as I want to be greedy when others are in extreme fear like buffet says.

   Our initial response is obviously to pay down as much as possible but at this point our credit is starting to tank due to late payments. We have already cut budget but had a few life emergencies (without a savings net) occur. Lesson learned for walking the tight rope without a harness and safety net. So we are in debt, typical story for the US lower middle class. 
We are only 31 and do not have a massive amount stacked up, so I would like to fix this now sooner than later.

Obviously we have some work to take care of before that.

How could I utilize my leverages that I possibly have to lower the interest burden/late payments while giving me a “stimulus” to pay down the credit burden I have already started? 

   I spoke with the person who originally did my mortgage loan and he said that with my situation a HELOC may be a solution to at least consolidate and buy some time to get my credit repaired. I know that his job is to get me to hire him to get mortgage loans from me, so I get the bias that naturally occurs. What insight would you have for someone in my situation looking for a solution?

inflation,Inflation discussion,"How bad is inflation now and how much worse can it get? I spent some time on this rainy weekend listening to podcasts on the Economist while trying to complete some projects inside the house, so I could learn more about the current situation. 

In short: I'm not an expert on monetary policy but things seem grim.  The most frightening thing is just how wrong the so called experts have been on predicting inflation over the last year.  While some predicted inflation would be a problem, there was almost no one who thought inflation would be as high as it's been this year.  The other scary thing is that there is no real way for inflation to come under control without the Federal Reserve raising interest rates quickly, and the Fed has never done this in its history without causing a recession. The only question among economists is how bad the recession will be.  We haven't been in this situation in almost 50 years, which is even more concerning to think about; that so many of the people the last time this happened are now dead. 

The worst thing about inflation is that it is a regressive tax that punishes the working class the most.  I feel for all those ""essential workers"" who pushed so hard during the pandemic, and fought for raises only to now see those raises essentially wiped away by rising prices.  We run the risk now of entering a ""wage-price"" feedback loop where workers demand more pay due to rising costs, but businesses who offer these higher wages are forced to raise prices, which only pushes inflation even higher. Rising inflation also threatens to curtail consumer spending, particularly in the leisure and hospitality segments that are only barely recovering from COVID.  The fear of rising interest rates also cuts deep as businesses will be concerned about taking on debt to invest in large projects or expanding their workforce.  This is partially why we have seen every single asset class (with the exception of real estate and perhaps oil) currently in free fall over the past few months.  

The other question: why did this happen? Yes, the war in Ukraine is a problem, but it's misleading to blame everything that is happening on the war.  Inflation here in the states is far worse now than it is in the EU which is also impacted by the war. The difference is the US spent far more money during COVID than those other nations and now we are paying the bill for it.  Even some of the most liberal journalists (i.e. Vox) are placing a large share of the blame on Joe Biden and the Democratic party for spending far too much money in the American Rescue plan, throwing gasoline on an economic raging fire, then Biden's Fed taking far too long to perform their primary duty which is to protect investors and US citizens from the damaging effects of inflation.  It's astonishing to think too that the situation could be even worse than it is now if the ""Build Back Better"" bill had passed Congress and printed even more trillions of dollars from the treasury. Joe Manchin was a pariah in the liberal media a few months back for killing the bill, but he might have just saved the Democratic party from itself, as Jeff Bezos pointed out recently.  It's basic economics 101 to know that printing too much money in a short amount of time is a recipe for making the currency weak and rising prices (just ask the Confederacy how that worked out for them in the Civil War, when inflation in the rebel states was over 8000 percent!) Or of course Venezuela, which Fox News has used as a scare tactic example for years. Perhaps we are closer to Venezuela now however than we would like to admit.   

TL:DR   We are in real trouble economically. Inflation has a lot of negative effects most of us don't even think about, and a lot of us have never seen a situation like this in our life times, and I'm sure those that have hoped they never had to see it again.  A recession is already here or will be soon. I'm not a financial advisor but it seems it is not time to ""buy the dip"" now in the stock market. Sadly not much we can do but wait it out and hope those in charge are smart enough to get us through this, but almost all the experts have been wrong so far which is not encouraging.  Inflation will probably be the number one issue in the upcoming elections and the democratic party will be in a round of pain if they can't right the ship quickly.

CryptoCurrency,An introduction into Crypto,"Hey everyone, as I began to explore and try to understand this space, it occurred to me that I may not be the only one that doesn't know shit about fuck. So I figured I would share some of the shit about fuck that I puzzle pieced together by cutting and manipulating the pieces to where I see fit.

I figured this information would be helpful in understanding one of the core principles in decentralized finance and why it is **revolutionary**. Feel free to correct me on any misinformation or add information where I may not have explained. With the influx of interest in this space from an investment standpoint,  information on the foundations of the technology is imperative to understanding our investments. So without further ado...

To understand crypto, you must first contemplate these two questions:

1. **Should the central bank be independent of political influence**?

2. **Is the central bank independent of political influence**?

If the answer to the first question is yes, then the second one is important. If you answered no, then the second question is irrelevant. But either way, the reason crypto exists is because the answer for the majority of people within this space would answer them as:

1. **Yes**

2. **No**

So, typically the central bank’s purpose is to manage a state/entity (countries) currency and monetary policy. This is usually governed by a known board of people. Despite even the best intentions to be apolitical, dealing with policy will inherently be political, which can be open to opportunities of corruption or misalignment of values for the majority of the society that utilizes the currency. Now, that’s not to say the central bank is evil or corrupt by any means, rather, they exist to fulfill a need of controlling an entities economy the best they can and hopefully independently from political influence. Yet, humans are social creatures with the ability act on their own volition, which brings us back to the openness to corruption or misalignment within a central bank despite being its own governing authority. This is the problem with a centralized financial system (CeFi).

Thus, decentralized finance (DeFi) has now been made capable thanks to technological advances in math and science, specifically through that of blockchain technology, a subset of internet connectivity. Blockchain technology allows a shareable distributed database operated by nodes to secure and validate or invalidate a record of transactions, all done computationally. This is important because it helps provide a solution to the inherent problem of CeFi by distributing the control of a currency amongst its users rather than a specific authoritative body. This effectively gives the ability to distribute the record keeping (distributed ledger) and decision making to a larger portion of the currency’s users, wherein, minimizing the potential for corruption or misalignment of values of a majority. This is akin to be more democratic, but the decision making isn’t totally operated in a vacuum, more on this later.

So, we finally have a system that could revolutionize finance by using a more mathematical approach in DeFi. Yet, DeFi does not go without its own set of problems, just like anything in life. Specifically, an inherent problem of a DeFi is the **Byzantine Generals Problem**. The Byzantine Generals Problem is a game theory problem describing the difficulty of decentralized parties arriving to a consensus. This is important because without the ability to form a consensus, then nothing can get done as there is no trust in validating or moving forward on anything. Specifically, in blockchain technology without forming a consensus transactions cannot be agreeably validated and we are worse off in succumbing to corruption and misalignment of values. For this reason, CeFi exists, and for good reason as there wasn’t a very good alternative to it until *now*.

So back to that decision making not operating in a vacuum for DeFi. In order to solve this glaring Byzantine Generals Problem in DeFi a consensus system is a necessary part of blockchain technology. Currently, the two main types of consensus protocols are proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS). These consensus layers utilize nodes operated separately from other nodes but communicate with one another to determine if they are in agreement with a transaction/record, effectively creating a consensus system for the network. Without getting into details, the key differences in these consensus protocols is that PoW utilizes computationally heavy algorithms to prove they have invested *considerable work* into creating a block/validating transactions. Whereas, PoS utilizes *collateralized proof* that the owner of that cryptocurrency has put up sufficient funds of their own (staked) to be given rights to operate a node. Each system comes with their own pros and cons and has been subject of much debate, but these are the general two types of consensus protocols that are so essential to blockchain technology and why DeFi exists. 

In conclusion, in order to resolve the inherent problems of the opaqueness of CeFi, DeFi has finally been created effectively and able to resolve a real world problem that did not really have an alternative until recently. Of course, this is not the only useful thing about blockchain technology but it is foundational to cryptocurrency.

The rates they were offering could not be maintained long term and after they realised they had so many users in a 6 month locked contract they knew any move they make has damage control. They timed it perfectly with the LUNA crash for their reasoning to be self explanatory that the interest rates were not able to be maintained.

Yes the rates are not as good as they once were, but look at federal banking rates and then come back to crypto rates. We are just greedy and want more, that's not on them.

cybersecurity,"Need career advice, hope","I think this post is mostly going to be a rant and I hope that there are some people who can offer me some encouragement and some good advice but... Man I am so burnt out trying to make this career shift work!! 

A little about me: Back in late 2020 I attended a trial period for a coding boot camp that pushed me into the direction of Cybersecurity. I decided I didn't want to become a full-time coder but when I explored other areas of tech I just completely fell in love with cyber sec. Fast forward a few months and in the Spring of 2021 I started college. At the time I was 29 (now 30) and really didn't know what I was doing. I didn't want to do a boot camp because I knew the structure didn't work for me, so I picked a community college to get some basic courses done and found a nice AAS in cyber sec. Fast forward a year later and I am at the top of my classes and trying to do as much as I can outside of class like THM and HTB and applying like crazy for jobs.

That leads me to this rant. See, I am a  30 year old husband and father of 2 and I work in a warehouse. I've worked there for about five years now and man, it is grueling work. I mean absolutely beats you into the dirt day in and day out. I am constantly exhausted and I'm often surprised by my grades because most days I Just feel like a total zombie. My wife says she's noticed a drastic change in my mood and my awareness; that I'm rarely ""there"" and that I physically look exhausted. The thing that's getting to me, and why I am making this post, is that I cannot seem for the life of me to get out of that warehouse!!! I have been applying for at least six months now for a range of opportunities from help desk to IT analyst and SOC analyst, and there has not been a single opportunity come my way. Time and time again I am let down, I have even only had ONE interview!

I'm getting so fed up with people online. I AM jealous. Extremely jealous. When I read tweets or reddit posts about people being able to do some hack event while they're on the clock, or work on some side project for their github while they are working from home, I start to become so angry. I feel like I am wasting my time. I feel like as much work as I am doing and as much as I am proud of that work and my grades, that it's clear I'll never be at the advantage as some other people. I'm afraid that by the time I finish my AAS (and now I'm considering going for a bachelors, god willing) that I'm going to be behind the curve and it's going to be because I spent so much time outside of tech while in school.

I don't know if this makes sense to anyone or if this is just me being a big baby but I am so burnt out... I feel like I am the only one making the kinds of sacrifices I am making and I am scared shitless that it is all going to be for not. All of these jobs want years and years of experience but I can't get that! There's an 18 year old kind in my class who is working help desk right now and if he gets a bachelors then in the same timeline he'll end up with four or five years more experience than me when we both get our degrees! I am so frustrated and just don't know what I'm doing. I'm trying to just keep trucking along, keep my head up and keep working hard, but damn, it just feels like one day I'll wake up and realize I wasted my time and energy and the precious early years of my girls' childhoods...

So in closing I want to know... Are there any cyber sec professionals on this board who have gone through a similar experience? Are there any professionals who successfully transitioned from warehousing, or construction, or any other hard labor jobs, with a spouse and dependents? How did you do it? What kept you going? What was your first gig that helped you finally get out of blue collar?

personalfinance,How should I pay off this loan?,"My partner and I have a predatory loan for $130k that has an interest rate somewhere between 25% and 35%. We want to pay it off in one go within the next 2 months, but I'm not sure which is the better route. Here is what I have to work with:

* I own a house that values around $500k, and I have a 30 year fixed 3.875% rate mortgage on it with a remaining \~$120k principal w/ 20 more years to go. My monthly payment right now is around $1300 including insurance + taxes.
* I have two 401k accounts, both of which currently value around $200k. I still have about 25 years before retirement age.
* I have around $50k in stocks and crypto that I could liquidate, but the market is pretty ugly right now if I want to sell.
* I am fully employed w/ an income around $125k/year.
* My credit score is above 800.
* Selling my house in the next 3 years is on the table, as I am planning on moving over seas later this year, and then probably renting out my house. But I don't want to do it at the moment because I'm not yet ready to move.

What is the smartest move here? 

* I can refinance my existing mortgage and get $130k cash out. That would leave me with a 30 year fixed 4.75% for $262k principal, and a payment of $1748/mo. I can afford the payment, but I lose my current fixed rate of 3.875%.
* I can cash out some of my 401k early. If I cashed out $200k, then I would owe about $86k to the man, and that would give me about $114k cash to use. But if I keep this $200k in my 401k for 20 more years, at a 10% return a year, I would have $1.3 million.
* Are there better options I don't know about?

Economics,Looks like the Fed has decided to crush the stock market,[deleted],finance,1652876553
stocks,"Stale data on housing costs are 40% of core-CPI, or why 2022 is going to continue to be a crappy year for risk assets.","**TL;DR: While there’s a lot of talk about inflation, by far the largest component of core-CPI (40% or several orders of magnitude more heavily weighted than everything else) is housing costs and due to the methodology “updated” numbers are actually over a year old. Virtually no one mentions this outside the academic literature. For this reason CPI could continue to rise for the next year or more, forcing the Fed to raise rates more than expected and essentially popping the pandemic-era everything bubble. We still have a ways to go before mean reverting to 2019 trend and there’s always a risk markets could overcorrect. So I’m keeping a lot of cash on hand and also favor buying commodities over stocks.**

I want to start by saying that inflation in my view isn't as new or scary as some will make it seem unless you're retired because there has also been wage inflation and people are earning more. Inflation is simply more demand than supply which causes prices to go up. We've all seen this play out countless times--not enough Yeezys or workers or raw materials as people want and the prices start skyrocketing. The difference between the inflation Jerome Powell (JPOW) talks about and some dude hawking Yeezys at a 500% premium to sticker price is really just how pervasive it's become in so many parts of our lives--food, energy, shelter, ie the basics.

JPOW got a lot of flak for repeatedly insisting last year that inflation was ""transitory."" **In a philosophical sense maybe he was correct--everything in life is transient said the Buddha. And everything will eventually get sorted out--but it took years to get here. It could take years to get back.**

*In a more immediate sense he was speaking of supply-demand mismatches that are partly a result of ""supply chain bottlenecks"" like chip shortages that cause shortages of new cars that had spill over effect into used cars. This is definitely part of the story. But so too is the confluence of pandemic-era accommodative fiscal (stimulus) and monetary (QE, negative real rates) policies by Congress and the Fed, respectively.* Just as one example, if a family was receiving thousands in stimulus payments and child tax credits (expiring) and also saw the value of their home and retirement accounts double because the Fed kept nominal rates near zero while buying trillions in bonds to essentially create money then they might have been quick to go out and buy an even bigger home or take a really nice vacation--but because millions of other families were in the same boat lumber prices and airfares started to soar. And in a sense this effect really is ""transitory"" although it will likely take years to mean revert.

**By the end of 2019, the S&amp;P 500 had (already buoyed by 4 previous rounds of QE since 2008) trended up to 3000 and the Nasdaq to 9000. Markets tend to overshoot and overcorrect** so short or medium term it's really anyones guess where things will bottom out but in the absence of QE and the return of higher interest rates I think we are likely to revert back to the pre-pandemic trajectory at some point. **And there's another 20-25% of correction left before we get there**

It will probably be a choppy road but the reason in my view markets haven't corrected harder is the hope that the Fed can somehow engineer a ""soft landing,"" or in other words avoid having to engineer a recession to get asset prices back in line. This will be difficult for a number of reasons that are not a secret: The conflict in Ukraine has further accelerated the multiyear supercycle in commodity prices (if you look back in history, commodities invariably go through multiyear periods of extended boom followed by cyclical bust) **that was already underway. Furthermore, extended Covid-related lockdowns in China will cause further supply disruptions and costs increases.**

**And now with all this in context I finally get to the crux of my post:** While the markets are probably pricing in Ukraine and the China-lockdowns and the probably of two 50 basis point increase in interest rates, **the Fed will likely be under even greater pressure to raise interest rates more and possibly faster than markets are already expecting while also drawing down their massive balance sheet for one rarely discussed reason:**

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm)

We use the BLS Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the primary gauge of inflation. **In the CPI, there are two components of housing costs: owners’ equivalent rent of residence (OER) and rent of primary residence, which combined are 40 percent of core CPI**, which is the most widely watched because it excludes volatile energy and food prices.

However, these are not real-time metrics. Unlike milk which people buy often, people enter into longterm leases and as such the BLS (the government agency that publishes the monthly CPI) divides into 6 cohorts. For the May measure, which will be released in the second week of June, the will ask 1/6th of respondents how much they pay in rent despite the fact that most of respondents entered leases during the pandemic when before wages and home prices started to skyrocket and the measure will be artificially lower.

An even larger component of the 40% than actual rent is owners’ equivalent rent of residence (OER).\*\*The methodology is beyond the scope but basically because BLS considers homes investments rather than consumption so uses an indirect metric rather than asking about actual expenses like maintenance or **mortgage rates (which are rising and not captured)** or taxes. I'm going to defer to a group of economists much smarter than me to explain. One is Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary, Chief Economist for the World Bank, and President of Harvard. This research is supported by multiple others and I will post a longer lit review if enough interest but probably suffice to say this is solid research by world leading scholars with no obvious interest in manipulating markets or selling anything and much more helpful than whatever equity research department at Goldman says.

[https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795)

&gt;""\[Last year\] home prices have jumped by 19.9 percent according to Zillow. The Zillow Observed Rent Index has increased 14.9 percent, and the CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index, likely to be a particularly good leading indicator for OER, had risen by 12 percent in December...  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Dolmas &amp; Zhou (2021) documents that historically the BLS measure of 12-month change in rental prices is more strongly correlated with the 12-month change in housing prices observed 16 months earlier than any more recent reading \[see [https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824)\]...  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Using a variety of techniques and datasets, we estimate housing’s contribution to 2022 inflation as almost incompatible with a swift return to trend inflation.""

&amp;#x200B;

**I don't think the 16 month delay is definitive but needless to say the CPI data we are looking at is VERY STALE and at least a year old. While we may say headlines about airplanes fares (only 0.5% of the CPI) we forget that 40% of core CPI measures direct and indirect rents over a year ago and won't capture any decreases until 2023 at the earliest. For this reason, it is my view that the Fed will be under pressure well into next year to continue to raise rates and push markets further down to eventually mean revert to pre-pandemic levels.**

In fact, JPOW said just yesterday “It’s not a time for very nuanced readings of inflation” and the priority will be getting “very high” headline inflation (ie core-CPI) down. I take that as him meaning the Fed won’t be very concerned about why core-CPI remains elevated even if partly due to very stale data for its largest input and could continue increase rates faster (ie 50 bs during all FOUR remaining meetings this year and continue well into next year… the market is currently pricing in less with the Federal Funds rate currently at 1% and the 2 year at 2.58%). 

So what to do?

**C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me aka Delever)**. Even if the scenario of a Fed being more Hawkish than currently priced somehow doesn't pan out the risk-reward profile of markets at present is not favorable in my view. **Keep a lot of cash on hand**. Even if you're still convinced GME is the greatest thing since sliced bread, keep some cash. **Remember that high beta growth stocks are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates since their valuation depends in part on very far out csh flows that need to be discounted to present at a higher cost of capital.**

Also **consider hedging**. Put options might be an obvious play but also consider (and I usually hate ETFs) an ETF that is short ARKK or SOGU (which is short SPACS) or an ETF short emerging markets (which tend to get hit even worse than the US when rates rise quickly) or an ETF short the US housing market on a forward basis... not 16 months delayed like the CPI. Not for the faint of heart but you can also follow the Fed in selling treasuries by buying a fund that shorts them.

And **diversify**. Sounds like boring boomer advice and the energy trade has become crowded but the energy sector and underlying commodities remain attractively priced in my view. Yes you would have ignored me 6 months ago and that ""would have been the time to buy"" but with PEs of 10s and low price to book and sky high dividends and buybacks this sector remains attractive in the face of rising inflation for the next few years until everything gets sorted out. Remember that commodities tend to rise in supercycles that last years and it's possible we're just getting started.",finance,1652876952

stocks,"The U.S. junk bond spread has accelerated to widen, has it reached a substantial turning point?","Although it belongs to the riskiest part of corporate bonds, as of the end of April, U.S. high-yield bonds (or junk bonds) have seen the Fed tightening monetary policy, rising inflation, continued volatility in U.S. stocks, supply chain disruptions and the Ukraine crisis this year. In the context of bombing, the performance is always good. However, this situation gradually reversed after entering May.

&amp;#x200B;

Party City reported disappointing earnings last week after the company struggled in the first quarter under pressure from constrained helium supplies and soaring prices. The price of Party City’s $750 million junk bond due 2026 issued a year ago fell to around 70 cents from 90 cents at the end of April after the earnings report. And as investors begin to reassess whether the junk-bond market can withstand a dimming economic outlook, Party City is not alone.

&amp;#x200B;

The ICE U.S. High Yield index was down 8 percent this year through the end of April. The index's decline was thought to be driven almost entirely by a rapid rise in interest rates, though it was still significantly better than the Nasdaq's 30% drop over the same period. This is also consistent with past cycles. When external conditions worsen, bonds typically lose less than stocks because of their higher status in a company's capital structure.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, the spread between junk bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds can reflect investors' confidence in credit risk and the financial health of junk-bond companies. At the beginning of this year, the spread was 3.10%, and as of April 21, it rose to 3.5% and remained stable overall. But since then, the spread has started to climb faster, rising to 3.97% at the end of April. The spread then rose another 0.5 percentage point over the next nine sessions, during which junk bonds were sold more than all of the first four months of the year. This trend of wider spreads is more pronounced for CCC-rated junk bonds, the worst rated among them, and has gradually begun to spread to BBB and BB-rated junk bonds.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of returns, overall CCC-rated bonds outperformed higher-rated bonds earlier this year, as the solid economic outlook led the market to expect the overall health of these companies to improve over time. This narrows interest rate spreads and offsets the negative impact of Fed rate hikes. But in May, returns on CCC-rated bonds fell below the overall return on junk bonds, a clear sign that investor concerns about interest rate risk are starting to turn into concerns about credit risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Matt Eagan, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles, said: “This \[junk bond market\] has become a very tough market right now, and there’s really no hiding place. And, by the nature of the big sell-off, junk The bond market is also at a turning point (whether a technical sell-off or a longer-term sell-off due to a changing fundamental environment).”

&amp;#x200B;

That said, a recent survey of the views of bond fund managers shows that they do not believe a material inflection point in the junk bond market has yet been reached. Confidence among bond fund managers that the junk bond market can withstand further headwinds remains, albeit less dramatically. One of the bond traders even said that ""it seems like a buying opportunity right now,"" but interestingly, most bond fund managers are still hoping that ""other people can start buying first.""

&amp;#x200B;

The ICE U.S. High Yield Index is now at 7.5%, and it has only been above that level four times in the past decade, most recently at the height of the coronavirus-induced sell-off. Going back further, it will be traced back to the period of economic growth panic in 2018 and the energy crisis in 2015.

""My benchmark for the bond market at the end of the first quarter was that the U.S. economy would be able to achieve a soft landing,"" said Jeremy Burton, an analyst at PineBridge Investments.

CryptoCurrency,"I created a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the April IMF Global Financial Stability Report along with my personal opinion regarding the future for Stablecoins, Cryptocurrency and CBDC's, I think it sort of paints a picture of the current global financial situation in a way that isn't being communicated","Below are several excerpts from the **April 2022 IMF Global Financial Stability Report, Chapter 3 - The Rapid Growth of Fintech: Vulnerabilities and Challenges For Financial Stability**. Link at bottom

My intent was to read this report with an attempt to understand the threat and risk to stablecoins and cryptocurrencies.

""Fintech—technological innovation in financial activities—can reduce costs and frictions, increase efficiency and competition, and broaden access to financial services.""

""By taking innovation to a new level, a form of financial intermediation based on crypto assets, known as

decentralized finance (DeFi), has had extraordinary growth in the past two years, potentially offering higher efficiency and investment opportunities.""

""Regulation should focus on elements of the crypto ecosystem that enable DeFi, such as stablecoin issuers and centralized exchanges.""

""Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to financial applications—called “smart contracts”—processed by computer code on blockchains, with limited or no involvement of centralized intermediaries.""

""Consequently, DeFi offers broad access to players of any size and has no need for custodian service, potentially improving efficiency and financial inclusion.""

**""Similar to traditional lending, DeFi is not free from market, liquidity, credit, operational, and cyber risks. DeFi lending can incur losses under unfavorable market conditions, and liquidity mismatches can be a cause for failure to meet redemption requests.""**

""The results indicate that the one-year probability of liquidation \[for borrowers\] is 24 percent on average, reflecting high volatility and a rising trend in crypto prices""

""Liquidity could become insufficient during periods of market stress. Depositors provide liquidity to DeFi lending platforms, which facilitates lending these deposits to borrowers. The total amount of loans that can be issued is capped by the total amount of deposited assets, or liquidity, on each platform. Similar to the loan-to-deposit ratio in traditional banking, the utilization rate measures how much of the liquidity for a particular crypto asset has been loaned out on each DeFi platform. When demand for borrowing a crypto asset increases, the utilization rate for its liquidity pool rises accordingly. However, a very high utilization rate could create problems for redemptions when many depositors try to withdraw at the same time. To minimize this risk, DeFi platforms set a threshold utilization rate above which the lending interest rate goes up steeply to discourage higher utilization. The median utilization rate is typically high for stablecoins and low for volatile assets; however, there have been instances for both types of assets when utilization rates approached 100 percent during periods of market volatility.

Liquidity provision is highly concentrated, making DeFi platforms ironically less decentralized than expected. On average, half of the deposits are provided by fewer than 10 accounts, with even more concentrated in smaller and more volatile crypto assets.""

""With higher concentration, an idiosyncratic withdrawal of funds by any of those large depositors can have a material impact on the liquidity condition of the platform.""

""A more extreme outcome would be equivalent to a bank run—when participants rush to withdraw liquidity from the platform.""

""Authorities should encourage DeFi platforms to adopt robust governance through industry codes and build effective public-private collaboration to establish self-regulatory organizations. A transparent and credible governance system could improve risk management, facilitate good conduct of financial transactions, and eventually attract more users and capital to the platforms.""

Last paragraph.....""Enforcing regulations—including restrictions—in DeFi markets is challenging, as experience from crypto markets shows. One potential approach is to restrict the exposure of regulated firms to DeFi markets (especially markets not subject to proper regulation or self-regulation), which could slow the pace of growth while addressing the risks of interconnectedness with regulated markets.""

**Chapter 1 noteworthy notes regarding CBDC's**

""Within the G20 initiative to enhance cross-border payments there is a workstream on how CBDCs could improve cross-border payments and increase global economic integration. Efforts to increase resilience to sanctions could undermine this project, and instead lead to fragmentation as national central banks seek to establish CBDCs independent of international infrastructures.""

**My takeaway from this and everything else I see in the picture is as follows. The current Stablecoin environment has a whole lot of risk I didn't know about. The government likes the technology, yet they see a lot of risks and vulnerabilities so they would like to regulate them for a future economy. In the meantime there are inherent risks to the global economy. The risk that caused the LUNA/UST failure is outlined in the IMF document (with some quotes above) and the IMF document has been out since April. I expect USDC will become a US CBDC Stablecoin eventually (this year). However, there is a risk of USDC (and other stablecoins) failing before regulation is implemented due to the risks outlined in the IMF report. My suggestion to anyone using stablecoins in today's environment would be to convert them to a different currency frequently, daily, or whatever time interval is suitable such that ones entire stablecoin holdings do not diminish to zero.**

**Cryptocurrencies will be split into digital securities and digital commodities categories. There will be thousands of each. There also might be a lot of pain felt in the near term but the best digital commodities will survive and thrive. For example, Solana will be considered a commodity and utilizes USDC-SPL as the standard Stablecoin for DeFi projects built on their ecosystem. A commodity is considered to be finite so therefore the price of the commodity increases when demand goes up because there is a limited supply.**

**I embrace regulation and CBDC's and want it to come QUICKLY.**

**The catch, DeFi by definition will not exist anymore due to a central authority regulating all aspects surrounding cryptocurrencies, including standardizing some aspects of the code used to ensure security. It also means a cashless society is coming soon, along with accountability for everyone.**

**Last thoughts:**

**If Bitcoin is highly corelated to the NASDAQ, and Bitcoin is labeled as a commodity, and commodities are traded on the NASDAQ then that changes my entire picture of crypto. I wonder what they will call ""cryptocurrencies"" in the future when they are treated as securities and commodities?**

**Another take on this is China bans digital commodities and digital securities and Russia treats digital commodities and digital securities as foreign currency.**

I also have an 18 year old car that’s on its last leg. I plan to purchase one within the next year or so.

My current plan is:

- save 1.5k for Roth IRA w/ Vanguard 
- keep 2k for down payment on car (parents will help)
- keep 500 in checking account
- possible 1k payment on student loans 
- remaining 1k has not been decided, maybe split with IRA and savings account

At the Fed meeting in May, Powell announced that it will start shrinking the balance sheet from June 1, and plan to reduce its holdings of $47.5 billion in assets every month, which will increase to $95 billion in three months.

Finally I spoke to her and she said she was having ""a personal crisis"" because of a ""close relative with cancer"". She said the loan is still a go but had two more things that needed taking care of, and promised to email them to me the next day, which she didn't do.

personalfinance,Best way to get out from under debts?,"So this is going to sound pretty bad and I know I've made some dumb choices in the last 5 years but hoping to get some ideas here. 

So my partner and I are unmarried, no kids, both fully employed, both have pretty bad credit scores (650ish and she has some stuff in collections on her record). We make a combined $5800 net after taxes each month but end up paying out $2400 a month in debt repayment and $1400 for our mortgage, so about $1200 left after that. Nothing in savings and we end up living paycheck to paycheck each month. We have been trying to work on tightening our budget and put anything extra towards our highest interest debts but it just isnt enough. She is about to get hit with her student loan payments in August which will be around $500 a month and we just dont see how we can afford it. She had deferred them when Covid started since she lost her job then (part of where a lot of the credit card debt came from) but now they wont let her defer them anymore since she has a good job now.

We both enrolled in a greenpath debt consolidation program a year ago so got some of those interest rates down but then her father passed away unexpectedly and she put $4000 on a high interest credit card (33% apr!) To pay for the funeral costs and we are struggling to make any headway on that one. I looked into another consolidation loan but the interest rates i can get are still 30% due to my credit rating, and this particular card doesnt work with the consolidation company so we cant just roll it into our current program.

My greenpath has $23000 left, average of 8% interest, 2 years left to payoff, $905 monthly.

Her greenpath has $6700 left, 5% interest, 2 yearsish left at $280 a month.

I also have a care credit card for vet stuff at $3000 at 30% apr, $100 monthly payment

She is paying $400 a month on that high interest card, i think it will be 2 or 3 years to pay that off at this amount each month. 

Also have a car payment of $270 a month, $10000 balance at 12%, about 3 years left on that.

In total i think its like $45,000 in debts, $7000 in really high interest cards, and again about $2400  each month going to those. Also 60k in student loans which i mostly try not to think about...

We do have a lot of equity in our home, around $100k if we were able to sell it now. Already checked to see if we could do a cashout refinance but they wont go for it since our debt to income ratio is too high. We thought about selling and paying off our debts but dont have a savings to get a new house and with homes as pricey as they are right now it would be probably $2500 a month for a new mortgage and we are scared to buy a $400k house and have the market crash or something. 

I have some old friends who may have 45k sitting around and was thinking of trying to get a private personal loan but ive never asked anyone for money and dont really know if that is appropriate and scared to ruin those friendships by asking, but did come up with some proposals that might be enticing, like 10% interest and maybe a percentage of our home sale idk.

stocks,The world's largest cannabis company by market cap has $0 in sales,"When I say ""world's largest cannabis company"" you may think of Tilray or Canopy Growth, or maybe you're familiar with the big US cannabis companies like Green Thumb Industries or Curaleaf. Well, those companies have all been dwarfed by a new giant in the space, Bright Green Corporation (BGXX).

At a staggering market cap of $7.6 billion, BGXX has nearly triple the market cap of the existing leaders in the US cannabis space (Green Thumb $2.3B, Trulieve $2.4B, Curaleaf $3.34B) despite these companies each selling over $1B of cannabis in the US each year and growing at 20-40% annually, several of which are even free cash flow positive despite 80% tax rates.

So what has BGXX done to warrant such a huge market cap?  Are they raking in record revenues or growing super rapidly? Well, none of those actually, in fact, they have $0 in revenue and no real plans to generate any revenues anytime soon. All that they have is a conditional agreement to produce cannabis for the DEA for research purposes. The facility they plan to do this in has yet to even be built. They just have a plot of dirt and a conditional agreement from the DEA, but that's enough to get them to a nearly $8 billion market cap..

This means BGXX is operating with the approval of the federal government, which enables them to be listed on the NASDAQ. Meanwhile, the other US cannabis companies that are actually selling cannabis in the US states where it's legal cannot list on the major US exchanges.

So what's the takeaway from this? Well there is clearly a demand for investor access to US cannabis companies on the major exchanges given the nearly 400% run up of BGXX since it IPOed earlier this week (IPO price was $8). For BGXX specifically, I plan to short it to the ground when options become available. This is clearly a cash grab from the early investors. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they end up never even producing any cannabis for the DEA and just shutting their doors or ""pivoting"" after such a large cash grab.",finance,1652908150

I'm 36, my spouse is 36, we are both lawyers. Our aggregate income is around $350,000-$400,000 before taxes, with a good $25-$100K being bonuses. Our jobs are both medium to strongly secure based on our firm environments and specific experience which has been in very high demand for years.

We own a home worth approximately $1.3M in this present ridiculous market, mortgage payment is $3,700 with a 2.7% 30 year fixed loan.  We still owe about $500K. It's in San Diego so its not a mansion, but it's in what I believe is a reliably low inventory market that will not lose all of its value if there is a crash.

We have approximately 100K in a quasi-security fund.

I have a 2020 Toyota Camry that is essentially paid off.

My wife has purchased a Tesla Model Y, although we haven't taken delivery yet. This is a very large and ridiculous expense, but she wanted it so she got it, and she has been driving her parent's jalopy since she was 16 (i.e., this is her first car ever so I can't talk her out of it).

Our average monthly spending is probably somewhere around $6,500 - $7,000. I realize this is high and we are bad with money (clothes, eating out, etc.). Part of our plan is to drill down and limit our monthly spending.

My spouse puts the maximum into her employer's 401K.

My office does not offer a 401K because the average income is too high.

My wife has approximately $200K in student loans. If they are unpaused she will pay a maximum of approximately $1,000 a month essentially until she dies. We have accepted this at this time.

I have approximately $40K in student loans. If they are unpaused I will also pay about a maximum of $1,000 a month until they are paid off, which will take around five years given the interest rates (\~6%), assuming that there is no loan relief.

We have no kids, and do not plan to have any.

I'm familiar with the Prime Directive, but we have absolutely zero investments other than my wife's 401K, and now the market is going absolutely crazy, and I'm trying to figure out where we should put our money. We want low to mild risk investments only.

Should we attempt to start traditional IRAs at our age?Should we invest in Index Funds at this time given market insanity?

In principle, 8.5 percent inflation in the United States means that prices increase by 50% every five years. This effectively reduces the purchase power of the dollar by 33%, turning $100 into $66. Is this the fall of USD?  


On May 4, the Federal Reserve (FOMC) of the United States is likely to make a decision on interest rates, but more crucially, the FED is expected to unveil a scheme to unload some of its $9 trillion balance sheet. As a result, rather than supporting the debt and mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve will most certainly sell $95 billion worth of these assets each month. Do you think this could affect the crypto market as well?   


Risk markets have factored in the possibility of catastrophic outcomes. In 2022, the Russell 2000 mid-capitalization stock market index, for example, is down 16.5 percent year to date. Similarly, the Chinese stock market has had a 20% year-to-date correction, as assessed by the MSCI China index. Is this the time for investing?

During the school year, since our schedules weren’t too different and my school and her job (both of which are in dc) were close to one another, my grandma was able to drop me off and pick me up before/after work. On days she didn’t work I took the subway and then an Uber/or she picked me up. I’ve had my license since December 2021.

I got a nurse externship job at a hospital in dc for the summer and the job can extend to also working prn there during the school year. The pay is $20.12/hr for 36-40 hours a week . I’m supposed to start in June.

My shifts can be night, day, and weekend shifts. The closest train stations to the hospital are ~25 minute walk away. 

My grandmother proposed the idea of me getting a car. The alternative is taking the metro and Uber/lyft after my shifts, which can be a little expensive. I used lyft to go to the hospital today and it was $40, which was cheaper than the $50 Uber was charging. 

While having a car would be nice, I’m thinking I’d either have to set up a payment plan or take out a car loan to help purchase it. And hopefully use the money I make from working to pay it off. Furthermore, next school year my clinicals will be more frequent and there’s no guarantee my placements will be as convenient location wise as they were this semester (They were at the university my grandmother works for hospital). Also, my grandmother is getting older and I know potentially working less is an option she is thinking about since my grandpa has advanced Alzheimer’s and figuring out how to pay for his care as the disease progresses is an issue she is currently dealing with.

 I already have student loans I’m worried about taking on more debt. My credit score is 745 if that helps. I don’t know how to ride a bike. I have ~$2,500-3,000 to allocate to a car.

I honestly have no idea about cars, car loans, and how taking out a car loan may impact me negatively, which is why I’m posting here. 

If it is reasonable to get a car/take out a car loan, what kind of price point/car should I be looking at. I know mileage is important, but what’s a price that can hopefully ensure the car will last for sometime and won’t fall apart quickly? Also, I apologize if anything I’ve said about paying for a car doesn’t make sense. Like I said I know nothing about paying for cars and my grandmother typically pays for hers in full

*just so no one thinks we leave my grandpa at home alone when we’re not there he has a caregiver, but he’s definitely getting at (or maybe even past) the point of putting him in a facility. We’re just trying to keep him home as long as possible because my grandmother is trying to figure out the best way to pay for his care given how expensive Alzheimer’s facilities are and since he didn’t set aside money for long term care/pay much into social security.",finance,1652929846
personalfinance,"Auto loan with high interest, personal loan + credit card vs plastiq + credit card","I have an auto loan with Subaru for $5200 at a 9% interest rate that my parents kindly passed on to me. Currently paying the minimum monthly for what I can afford + my insurance which is through the roof expensive. I'd rather not pay that ridiculous interest rate. Subaru doesnt allow credit card payments (cant pay debt with debt), so I was considering getting a personal loan at a lower interest rate to pay off the car (now owning the car my full coverage insurance would drop significantly in price).

Then I was considering opening a 0% APR credit card (18 months offer) and using that to balance transfer the personal loan onto the 0% APR credit card and paying off a decent amount every month with the money I'd save on my insurance cost while also not accruing interest. I already know I would pay off the loan in that time period before the APR jumps to like 15% and higher.

It's confusing because the internet isnt very clear as to what credit cards could be used for a balance transfer from a personal loan used for an auto purchase, and what loans allow balance transfers using a credit card. Is it just given that this is allowed/disallowed? I also know that there will be a transfer fee for transferring from personal loan to credit card (3-5% of the loan) but I'd be saving so much on interest it'd be worth it.

If this is possible, can anyone recommend a combination of the two that would be compatible? I've also heard of Plastiq and was considering that as an option for a one-time payment of the auto loan currently held by Subaru. But only recently became familiar with Plastiq so i don't know much and if it would work for my situation. I appreciate any responses that are productive and helpful.",finance,1652930649

stocks,Fed policy may have unpredictable consequences,"Solomon sees a 30% chance of a U.S. recession in the next 24 months

In an interview with several U.S. media outlets Wednesday, Solomon said higher interest rates and a smaller Fed balance sheet would have an unpredictable impact on the economy or corporate business . ""You have to consider the fact that at some point, a recession is a reasonable outcome or economic growth becomes very, very slow. If you're running a significant business, you have to look at the status quo more carefully now than you did a year ago."" He said.

&amp;#x200B;

A business survey released the same day showed that the confidence of U.S. business executives in the economic outlook has retreated due to rising raw material prices, persistent supply chain problems and the Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy. While most respondents expect a recession, Goldman Sachs believes the likelihood of a U.S. recession in the next 12 to 24 months is about 30 percent. ""Just because a recession is far from inevitable doesn't mean it's a sure thing."" Solomon said.

I had to mail the documents since I was past due and couldn't e-file. I did it directly through the post office but did not get anything certified or tracked (probably a mistake). I have received my state refund (IL) but received nothing from Federal. The IRS website shows nothing when I look up the refund status or account transcript.

stocks,What did everyone expect to happen?,"The difference in sentiment, posts, and attitudes between mid-2021 and now seems extreme.

However, even then, there were plenty of people warning what would happen when the Fed starts tightening, inflation stays persistent, and yields rise. Those warnings attracted significant downvotes.

If someone is going to sell at all, the time to do it would have been in November--certainly not now.

For those that are surprised at their portfolio changes in 2022, did you believe QQQ/SPX couldn't have a major correction after a huge runup in a short period of time, historically high valuations, combined with the fact rates would have to start increasing from 0?

A lot of people endorsed a ""high risk"" strategy and may be finding out their risk tolerance isn't what they thought. This is valuable to know, however. And those that are younger will have plenty of time to make back losses with perhaps a slightly different allocation strategy.

For those that keep asking ""Where is the bottom?"" or ""What will happen tomorrow?"", there is really no point in asking. Literally nobody knows. You can only do your own research and make your own decisions based on your own financial situation.

personalfinance,Opinions on apr rate for personal loan,"So I am buying a car and have realised that I am allowed to pay off the finance company early, the minimum being after 6 months. 
As a bank loan would have a much lower interest rate I am thinking taking out a bank loan to pay off the finance makes more sense, but as inflation is very high at the moment I think interest rates are gonna go up drastically. 
I have a good credit rating but have been told that’s not all bank loans look at, I was told if I were to start a savings account and put the amount of money in it equivalent to the loan repayment for the next 6 months it would highly increase my chance of being approved for said loan.
Ultimately my question is:

Do I apply for the loan now while interest rates are about 2.8% (and potentially get knocked back) or so I wait 6 months until I actually need the loan (and have proof of being able to afford repayments) ?",finance,1652947270
stocks,Growth Stock DD - Where to go first?,"We all are trying to do our DD more or less thoroughly but on every research I did I was frustrated about one thing.

I could not find any good analytics webpage/place to see basic company fundamentals, especially for growth stocks.

In my research I found tons of websites which allow chart analysis, candlesticks, chart voodoo and meme generators ;) but no website where I could compare companies (in same areas) on fundamental data. My specific question would be, is there any website which provides the following analysis and am I the only one looking for such?

\- Compare companies (of same area) on multiples, PE, forward PE, margin, revenue, rule of 40

\- Simulation for future development. E.g. one can insert expectation on revenue and ops margin grow and see how if a company is over or undervalued for a horizon of multiple years (of course based on personal growth expectations)

\- Calculate NPV based on future expected interest rate, company growth and multiples.

\- Track record of earning reports of those companies, ideally cleaned up from one-time effects such as M&amp;A activities, SEC fillings

I guess this is a loaded question. But I was surprised to not find anything suitable. How do you guys do your due diligence? By excel tables or do you have a hidden gem which does all the above for you?",finance,1652949490

1. Ponzi scheme: early adopters get more out, late adopters are the suckers paying exit money.
1. Negative sum game: money goes in, hardware and energy are paid with it, less money goes out.
1. Laissez-faire capitalism: money used for crime, black markets, and tax evasion.

The ""automating middlemen out"" perspective is not getting to the mainstream public, and it may not be easy to convey in short comments (as [I was trying to](https://npc.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/usw5bc/comment/i96d415/)). So here is a longer comment.

There are several points to consider to put this automation into context:

1. The 2008 bubble burst and how middlemen failed at preventing it.
1. The FED and the monetary policy, which has been printing money and creating a ""superbubble"" since then, which is probably exploding now.
1. Bitcoin as an alternative ""algorithmic monetary policy"".
1. The Marc Andreessen essay on [Why Software Is Eating the World](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460).
1. Ethereum, and the Ethereum smart contracts and Virtual Machine, which means ""algorithmic anything"" (being [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)).

That is a lot to unpack, but I am going to focus on the last point, which is the most important one. Sure, we may replace the FED and every similar middlemen across the globe with the algorithmic monetary policy of BTC. That is a huge feat, but what else may we replace?

1. The stock market.
1. The insurance market.
1. The entire financial sector.
1. Management, executives, other middlemen, and especially [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs). BTW: by definition, bullshit jobs create no value. Anything including a bullshit job, and the margins to pay its salary, is likely to be a negative sum game. There are plenty.

Blockchain is just a tool in the software toolset. Not everything may be solved with:

1. A message queue.
1. A database.
1. A frontend.
1. A machine learning model.
1. A blockchain.
1. etc.

But when you start combining the tools, more and more problems may be solved. For most problems, not all tools are needed. For some problems, blockchains and decentralization are not needed. For other problems, until we figure out alternative and better approaches for decentralized decision making, blockchains are a necessary tool.

The stock market is very automated, but it is not fully automated. It does not work 24/7, it requires real estate, and human blood in the currency of worked hours. With standard regulation for companies to tokenize their stocks, it could be completely automated, and be more efficient. Certainly blockchain could be more efficient, and it will be, but when we compare hardware and energy with human hours, we have two very different magnitudes.

The monetary policy may not have been a huge concern in the US, having a strong currency. Inflation is becoming a bigger concern only recently in the US, being already a big concern in other countries with weaker currencies. However, what should be a big concern in the US is insurance. Especially health insurance is a disaster in the US. Americans, if you do not know how healthcare works in a first world country, e.g. Germany, you do not know what you are missing. (Here is where I get the downvotes, but that is OK). In particular, insurance has the moral hazard of being a rival in your healthcare: the less they pay, the more money they make. This is something that would be nice to replace with algorithms. To a good extent it is, and again it will be replaced further, due to the moral hazard. Similarly, it is a negative sum: the total money leaving an insurance company is less than the money that people paid to it. Nobody claims that health insurance is a Ponzi scheme, and if you 

What some people claim to be a Ponzi scheme are nevertheless pensions. Pensions may be paid:

1. By oneself: you save, it is invested, you get the returns when you retire. It is not a Ponzi scheme, but it is speculation.
1. By the next generation: as long as the population pyramid allows it, it is safer: no investment means its return cannot be negative. But it is a pyramid scheme.

I do not have a list of the countries in the world that use one or other system. Similarly pensions may be public or private. YMMV, but it may be that your government is forcing you to participate in a Ponzi scheme, with your taxes, by law. However, crypto, without middlemen and being optional, gets the bad rep of Ponzi and speculation. Food for thought, I guess.

Similarly for the entire financial sector, e.g. replacing bank accounts with wallets. Today, you get a higher interest rate by depositing USDC in a lending protocol than in a bank account, why would you choose the latter? Obviously. because banks are more feature rich, as in direct debit, standing orders, etc. This is the value creation of banks, not getting out more money than you put in, they are negative sum, they have to pay their employees. But what would happen if blockchains had the same features without employees? Would the value creation still be zero and a negative sum game? Investing early is speculation, sure. It may be a reasonable speculation if you think that software is going to continue eating the world and blockchains will gain features and possibilities for value creation. That is how speculation works, check the historical P/E ratio of Tesla.

The last group: managers, executives, and other middlemen are the hardest to explain, and I do not want to hit the character limit, whatever it is. BTW: Thank you for reading so far. Read about the automation of management, flat organizations, etc. The automation of middlemen within organizations is an ongoing process, e.g.

1. TV channels would select the programs and schedule them.
1. Scheduling is gone in streaming platforms like Netflix
1. Production and selection is gone in more algorithmic platforms like YouTube, and
1. The risk of demonetization and deplatforming is gone with blockchain enabled platforms.

How many other decisions may be automated or avoided with software? How many organizations may be transformed into DAOs? BTW: even if some ""DAOs"" are democratic and not autonomous, that still beats the hierarchical/feudal approach of most organizations, IMHO. What middlemen may be replaced in the future? Nobody knows, and most people will underestimate. Philosophers were explaining just a few years ago how AI would never do things it is doing today. At the same time, AI researchers were promising to leave drivers and radiologists out of jobs. The only known limitation of algorithms is undecidable problems, which managers should not be solving empowered by Dunning-Kruger arrogance.

To conclude:

1. Everything may be automated, probably more than anybody expects.
1. It will probably take longer than anybody expects.
1. It has begun.
1. Automated is qualitatively more efficient than manual.
1. Automation will quantitatively become more efficient over time.",cryptocurrency,1652950598

CryptoCurrency,Major issue: is Bitcoin a symptom of loose monetary policy or a hedge for it?,"Has Bitcoin proved itself as a hedge or just a hyper bubble within the ‘everything bubble’?

I know Bitcoin is marketed as the go to ‘thing’ to hedge against collapsing economy but has it actually performed so yet? I seen it collapse in price while trad markets have risen and collapse more when they fall.

It had a moment of stability during one SPX drop which was a glimmer but otherwise 🤷‍♂️. 

This for me is the only question. So far I kind of just see it being memed into relevance on things like Twitter and here. Pomp even said ‘we memed BTC into a trillion dollar asset’ in celebration but isn’t that super worrying? 

One thing I always thought as of benefit over something like gold is how many people have sages for storing gold and how many people have smartphones for BTC. We are all entranced by shiny black mirrors and maybe why such valuations I not sure.

Like with everything it depends on overriding belief system. Maybe they will say gold is super spreader of new disease or something and big tech companies start adding BTC to balance sheet during this drop.

Will the meme become real?

personalfinance,Which will save me more money? A used car? or financing a Car?,"So in my last post I talked about how I walk to my job every day due to not having a car. So I woke up this morning to check how much I got paid. It was around 800+ and It's like 5 am and I'm singing with joy! With low payroll budgets at this job my checks are still looking pretty decent lol.

Anyway, I have a goal to eventually purchase a car in about 3 months. I would have around 8k or 10k by that time. And I'm torn on weather I should get a used cheap old car or a somewhat new (in the last 5 to 10 years) car that is financed.

I've always been team used car. But there are some problems. Used cars first of all are wayy hard to come by now with the economy still messed up. And not to mention the high mileage the cars tend to have. 

I have one friend who got their car from Facebook marketplace place for around 3k and it had about 100k miles on it. It's a 2005. It runs good but ideally I'd want something drastically lower like around (30k-50k) miles at least. Something barley driven.

Also In my last post I mentioned I want to save 40k in about a year and I did the math and if I purchased a used car in 3 months it'll take longer to reach that goal. I would have saved around 29k instead of the amount I really want.

So my next option could be to finance a vehicle. Now when I say finance a car I don't mean I want a bank loan to help pay it off. No rather just find a low interest rate and a car that's price is between (15k-30k). But on the flip side my folks don't think it'll be a good idea for me to get a dealership car.

For one dealers always want to up sell you and play mind games with you. They always tell me to be careful with that. Also they say it's way more expensive 🫰 when your financing. 

I have another friend who has been making car payments since 2018 and his car was about 35k. At this point in time it's probably close to paid off. 

So I don't know if anyone has any recommendations or advice please feel free to share your knowledge. I haven't made any purchasing decisions yet.",finance,1652958952

personalfinance,Bought an item online and it's stuck in customs,"Hello r/personalfinance.

I made a purchase through a reputable online store on April 25th. This was for a mother's day gift.

They had two shipping options. Standard was free but would arrive after mother's day, and the express shipping, which they guaranteed delivery between May 3-5, was around $20. 

All in total I paid around $80 for the item plus shipping. 

On May 5th I contacted the seller and requested an update for shipping. They then sent me a FedEx link. Upon clicking this link I was notified that my item was pending in Memphis TN. 

On May 7th I contacted the seller again and asked why my item was still showing as pending in Memphis. They then told me to contact FedEx.

On May 11th I called FedEx and was told, via automated message, that my item was held up in customs. I then emailed the seller and expressed how disappointed I was that my item failed to arrive upon thier guaranteed arrival date, and that I would like a refund for the shipping. The next day they replied saying that they will issue me one as a store credit. I decided to just let it go and focus my energy on waiting for the item to arrive.

It's now May 19 and my item is still in Memphis TN. I emailed the seller yesterday requesting a refund and they denied it. Saying they will contact the shipper, FedEx, to hurry up. Lol. I emailed the seller back saying it's out of FedEx's hands and is being handled by customs. 

At this point I feel I should request a charge back on my credit card. Had I known the item was being sent internationally, I would have purchased elsewhere. The seller most definitely should not be offering guarantee delivery dates, especially considering customs could get involved during transit. 

Has anyone on here experienced a situation like mine? Were you successful in getting your charge back?",finance,1652960323

My current job is alright, just has a lot of surprises and less than desirable pay. I started looking at other options on the side, when a recruiter reached out to me. The new job offer sounds great, but since it's unfamiliar territory, I'm not sure what the best next move is.


I'm focused on opportunities for growth and where I can make innovative changes. In the future I would like to work at a fintech company, but right now my options are just so similar. I know the standard is not to accept counter offers, but I started at my company in one of those out of college programs. When I was offered my current position earlier this year, I tried to negotiate my salary but was told that everyone who graduates from these programs are at a set rate. My current manager is telling me how she sees so much potential in me and how they want to invest in my career and bet on me, etc. Below are the details and what information I could find online.

- Background: &lt;2 YOE
- Industry: Financial Services
- Current Role - Official Title: Product Manager 1
- New Role - Official Title: Associate Product Manager

Both:
- Financial Services
- Reviews online say both have red tape around creating real change
- Less than market pay for both (this new company offered me more just from my initial offer, my current company is known to be less than market standard and I would say it's less than this new company)
- Reviews online say both have the same issues with growth and opportunities to get promoted


New Company:
- Offered $100K with $10K signing bonus (I currently have a $5K retention bonus at my current job which I would have to pay back if I take this role)
- For a new digital product that just launched this year on a newer team
- While the product is digital, it sounds like the role is more aligned to the business side of PM (customer surveys, strategy)
- I know that moving forward, the real innovators are fintech companies. I'm not sure how much technical exposure I would get.
- This company is known better by customers and known for their great customer service.
- I already accepted the verbal offer, signed the written copy, and in the process of getting my background check. (I waited to tell my employer until I had 2 weeks since I was nervous about passing my drug test but will very likely pass. I also looked up the pay range I'm in and I was very very doubtful they would/could even counter).



Current Company:
- Employer countered to $90K with $20K signing/retention bonus for 1 year
- Offered to promote me given good performance for the rest of the year
- More of a digital role where I shadow a Product Owner and Product Manager. I help out at a crew and program level. While both are great learning opportunities, I would like to focus on one area. 
- I get more exposure to technical work, which can help me move to a fintech company.
- We're understaffed so it's difficult to focus on one area, but with this, there's a lot of opportunity for me to take more ownership.
- The rest of the year we are working on fixing a product before making any new enhancements. 
- My manager is theoretically great, but is usually too busy to offer me feedback on what I could do better and in a way micromanages (she wants to approve anything and everything before sharing with our partners, late to meetings)

personalfinance,Starting new job at a tech company — how should I approach 401(k)/IRA/Roth 401(k)?,"Hi PF.

Haven’t posted here in a long time but I’m back for some advice. I’ll try and make it as quick as possible.

**Background**:

25M

Let me preface this and say I don’t really believe in retirement as the age of 59 1/2 or 55. Not sure if I make it until then? Idk, life is weird to look 30+ years out. I’m sure you guys thought this way when you were younger too. Anyways.

I just signed a job w/ a tech company for 140k base and 10k bonus split into monthly payments over 12 mos. This is legit life changing. I’ve tripled my salary job hopping since covid.

The company offers a 50% 401(k) match up to 4%, or a total of 2%.

I live in Florida so there are no state taxes. This is a fully remote position, it’s in my job offer — I (hopefully) can’t be called back into office so I believe the job security is there. 

**This is where the questions come in** — when I put away 4% of my salary for 401(k) in a calculator, my taxes were like 18% (just federal). If I were to put in $1,500/m, or close to IRS max, my taxes were 15.35%. 

Does it make sense to max out my 401(k) for the tax benefit? I plan on buying a home in 1-2 years and none of my 401(k) vests until 3 years with the company. I’m unsure if I will be w/ them for 3 years. I see the true money in serial job hopping and am unsure if a 2% match over 3 years would be the golden handcuffs that would make me stay.

I understand that an IRA is taxed dollars first and you can pull out anytime (why not just a stock brokerage account then)? But I don’t understand a Roth 401(k).

I know that there are special loopholes like your 401(k) isn’t included in assets for like student loans, can’t be taken from medical expenses etc., but are there any other loopholes? I would like to take a loan out against my 401(k) for FTHB purchase but doesn’t that defeat the purpose of a 401(k)? Lastly, with rates going up, wouldn’t it be smarter to be in cash/I-bonds instead of 401(k) if I planned to spend the money in the short term? 

Sorry if I’m all over the place I just want to make the smartest decision. Thank you all for your time and I’m looking forward to your responses!",finance,1652965535

I looked at Project Sunroof which told me I have 1,412 hours of usable sunlight per year and about 1,744 sq feet available for solar panels.  I have a monthly electric bill budgeted to $190/month. 

Project Sunroof says I need about 11.0 kW to cover 100% which would take 775 sqft. 

Should I trust this info? Another place to look?

If I read this correctly, I don't need my full roof to be covered.  Their image looks like just my Western facing portion would work. 

I just had my roof redone a couple years ago, so I'm ok there.  I surmise I would get panels, not roof tiles and I'd want a home battery. And if this really is as good as it seems, I'd get an electric car.

If this is reasonable, I think I'd prefer to outright own the panels than some deal with an installer. But maybe I'm missing out on something.

personalfinance,Using HSA to retire early,"I had a question about HSAs and using it as an investment vehicle to retire early.  I want to make sure that I understand everything correctly under the current tax laws.

I know that HSAs are tripe tax-advantaged: contributions are tax-deductible, contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals are not subject to federal income tax if used for qualified medical expenses.  Under current law, I can wait to reimburse myself at anytime for qualified medical expenses.

I also know that if I don’t use my HSA for qualified medical expenses, I can withdraw money without penalty at any time after reaching 65.  But at 65, if I don’t use my HSA for qualified medical expenses, then the IRS will treat it like a traditional IRA, and I will have to pay income taxes.   

At 59 ½ I can finally touch my Roth IRA and 401k without a penalty.  But if I want to retire before then, I will need to invest outside of those two vehicles and be subject to capital gains taxes.  I want to avoid capital gain taxes as much as possible.  Using the mega backdoor Roth and backdoor Roth, my spouse (who stays at home) and I can invest up to $73,000 that will grow tax free.  We don’t think we could save more than that every year.

So I am curious about using my HSA as a vehicle to retire before 59 ½.  Until I retire, I pay all my medical expenses out of pocket.  I then wait to reimburse myself until I retire at age 58.  At that point, I take out tax-free money and can live off that money until I hit 59 ½.  Am I understanding everything correctly? 

And what happens for medical expenses incurred in years where I choose a non-HSA eligible plan?  Can I still pay those expenses with my HSA?

Scenario 1:

For the next 25 years, I always choose a medical plan that is HSA eligible.  I invest all that money and get 8% returns, which gives me around $525k in my HSA account.  During these years, I incur $5k in medical expenses every year.  At the end of the 25 years, I have incurred $125k.  At that point, I retire and reimburse myself the $125k immediately.  I still have $400k in the HSA, which I can use for medical expenses and to withdraw from at age 65. 

Scenario 2:

For the next 25 years, I can only choose an HSA eligible medical plan for the first 15 years.  At the end of the 25 years, assuming 8% returns, I have around $420k in my HSA account.  During these years, I incur $5k in medical expenses every year.  At the end of the 25 years, I have incurred $125k. 

When I retire, can I reimburse myself the entire $125k.  Or can I only reimburse myself $75k (the amount incurred in years that I had an HSA eligible plan)?",finance,1652971292

solar,Starting a solar business in Louisiana,"I'm in the process of getting solar panels installed on my home and I've generally been dissatisfied with all the solar companies around me here in South Louisiana, from a level of service and communication standpoint and just in general with the whole ""greasy salesman"" vibes. Plus in all my searching I only found like 3 non-national companies to provide solar. I work as a chemical engineer (not actually degreed/licensed) and have been thinking a lot lately about my role in the climate arena and how my work for giant plastics and petrochem companies is impacting the world. 

Combining those thoughts with some entrepreneurial desire and I've been mulling in my head whether I could start my own company to provide better service and be a part of the move towards a renewable future. I figured you guys may be able to help me parse the ideas out and give some guidance.

Some questions off the bat:

1. How crazy am I? Obviously I've got a decent job that's fairly stable so I know it would be a leap into something new and uncertain. But also I see that ethical business ownership is a path to make the most good in society (provide fair jobs people, serve your community, aid in green energy revolution, etc). Is it stupid to try and start a solar panel business right when federal subsidies are about to run out? Do we think prices will drop any when those subsidies do go away?

2. Where do I even start? I've got a reasonable handle on the basic technical side of things but obviously would need training in specifics.  How do I make contacts with suppliers? I can look up on LA contractor licensing to find licensed solar installers. Financing supply for customers? I looked a little into getting some basic NABCEP training to get a better handle on it all. 

3. Are there any good references to help flesh out a business plan? How to decide what segment to be in - sales vs installation, residential vs commercial. Utility scale, etc. Sources for basic economic data of costs vs sales to actually estimate economics of it all. 

4. I saw one group in California that effectively leases solar panels to folks by installing panels for them and then charging them for the electricity they produce at a lower rate than the power company. Obv the economics are location and legislation dependent but to me this is an interesting proposition as a way to serve less wealthy communities that can't necessarily support the financing on their own merit. Not sure if anyone has any experience with that.


Basically, for all you actual business folks out there-where do I start? Louisiana has an estimated 1.8 million households, with only an estimated 18,000 having solar. So it seems like an enormous opportunity going into the future, and it seems like now is a time to get in while its still apparently impossible to find local solar providers.",energy,1652973260

I created an account but when I use my username and password to log in, it immediately asks me if i want a credit report and the only way to move forward is by clicking yes.  Its at this point it errors out.  Gives me an ""Oops, we're sorry! we've encountered an internal server error.  please note your order has been canceled sorry about the inconvenience.""  it then gives me a toll free number to call.

calling this number probably almost a year ago led to being fed irrelevant prompts and going in circles with no ability to speak to a human so i gave up.     


the other day I received an alert that my SSN was on the dark web.  I'd been wanting to get the account fixed anyways and this gave me reason to revisit it as i may very well end up freezing my credit just in case.    


well same error, same circles on the phone.    


Sorry for the book but how on earth can i get a person to tell me whats going on with my account relative to their website so i can log in properly?",finance,1652973858
stocks,"October is when stocks may hit a bottomA 'summer of pain' is shaping up for US stocks, with a 45% - 75% slide from S&amp;P highs.","* US stock markets will likely face much tougher conditions this summer, investor Scott Minerd said. 
* The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 could plunge 75% and 45% respectively, he predicted. 
* Minerd attributed an intense ruckus in the markets to the Fed's tightening monetary policy. 

The stock markets are in for a grim summer with the Nasdaq Composite and [S&amp;P 500](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;p_500) in for huge slides, according to Guggenheim's Scott Minerd. 

In an interview with [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-summer-of-pain-the-nasdaq-composite-could-plunge-75-from-peak-s-p-500-skid-45-from-its-top-warns-guggenheims-scott-minerd-11652901040) Wednesday, billionaire investor Minerd said there's a possibility of the [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/nasdaq_composite&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1652963302992864&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OMknUrk1Swlklp5lUa0WE) plunging 75% from last year's peak and the S&amp;P 500 dropping 45% from its top in the coming months. 

He compared the possible implosion to the dot-com bubble burst of the 1990s. ""That looks a lot like the collapse of the internet bubble,"" he said. 

Minerd's pessimistic outlook is fueled by the [Federal Reserve's](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-the-federal-reserve?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) aggressively tightening monetary policy where interest rates have been [lifted rapidly](https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-raises-interest-rates-may-double-sized-hike-mortgages-loans-2022-5). It comes in response to soaring inflation as a result of pandemic-era fiscal support, global supply chain blockages and surging energy and commodity prices from the war in Ukraine. 

He said the Fed is likely to raise rates even further until inflation cools down and ""until they see a clear breaking of the inflation trend."" If that means the Fed will dial up the benchmark rate above what is considered a neutral rate, that's what will happen, Minerd said.  

""With the passage of time as the Fed continues to hike, we will likely find ourselves experiencing the effects of increasingly restrictive monetary policy. Well before it reaches this terminal rate the Fed will increase the risk of overshooting, causing a financial accident, and starting a recession,"" Minerd said in a [research note](https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/perspectives/macroeconomic-research/fed-aggressiveness-sets-up-2023-collision). 

With more possible rate hikes pending, Minerd said a recession will be hard to avoid. He echoes sentiments expressed by other industry experts including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon who recently said there is a [""reasonable"" chance](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goldman-sachs-ceo-recession-odds-economy-david-solomon-fed-rates-2022-5) that the US economy will enter a recession. 

He added the Fed wrongly appears to have few concerns about a bear market in stocks. ""We are probably going to have a pretty severe selloff,"" he anticipated.  

US stock markets have been caught in a brutal storm this year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 plunging. On Wednesday, US stock indexes fell further, suffering their [biggest one-day loss](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-markets-today-us-futures-drop-as-inflation-fears-spread-2022-5) since the peak of the pandemic, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 4% and the Nasdaq 100 falling 5.1%. 

Despite volatility in the market, the Fed is unlikely to cushion stocks from sliding even further, Minerd said. ""What's clear to me \[is that\] there is not market put, and I think we're all waking to that fact now,"" he said.

Against such a backdrop, stock markets are heading for a ""summer of pain,"" he added. He continued, predicting October is when stocks may hit a bottom.",finance,1652974638

Here's the question: With 7-day yields on VCTXX at 0.60% and another vanguard money market fund (fully taxed) at 0.66% (VMFXX), it totally makes sense to put everything in VCTXX, right?  FWIW, I live in CA currently.",finance,1652975143

When I asked if I risk being charged a late fee, she said as long as they were received by April 15th, I'll be fine, but being that she can't confirm if/when they've been received I'm not quite comfortable with just sitting on my thumbs and waiting.

The rep mentioned I could put a stop on the checks and pay online, but mentioned if they go and try to cash the checks after that, I'll get charged a fee for bad checks. And wouldn't that trigger a late payment/fee? I'm kind of at a loss of what to do. Generally, they're quick to take my money.

personalfinance,EUR and USD near parity: what this means for investors,"The euro is near parity against the dollar for the first time in 20 years, but currency strategists are divided on whether it will reach that level and what that means for investors and the economy.

In Europe, the euro was hovering around $1.05 as of Thursday morning, having fallen steadily for nearly a year from around $1.22 last June. The common currency fell to just above $1.03 earlier this week.

The U.S. dollar strengthened on risk-off sentiment as concerns over Russia's war in Ukraine, soaring inflation, supply chain issues, slowing growth and tightening monetary policy prompted investors to turn to traditional ""safe haven"" assets.

The narrowing between the two currencies was also driven by differences in monetary policy among central banks. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark borrowing rate by half a percentage point earlier this month, its second hike in 2022, as it looks to rein in inflation to the highest level in 40 years.

stocks,Bull-Bear Market Strategy,"Buckle up for long post. Lets get straight into the topics:

**Situation: as known to many of you**

1. Inflation - Peaked? Don't think so. CPI data for month of May is out to be released June 10th, placed before the FED meeting. Get out of your mom's basement and take a look at the soaring gas prices. I think, this is the highest right now for gas prices. Food and other costs does not seem to have gone down either. So we can expect another high inflation number for month of May, released in June (&gt;8%)
2. In the past, only way out of SPY slump was easing the interest rates (2019 after 2018 rout, 2020, 2009 etc). Given the inflation is very high and unemployment rate is at a 50 year low, Powell will continue to stay very aggressive on the rate hikes. This is not going to be favorable for stocks. Refer to my post from months ago about effect of rate hikes to stock prices. I will probably need to recalculate the estimates in the earlier post to account for even higher rate hikes --- adjust downwards of course.

**Strategy:**

**Put Debit Spreads ....** yes that's it. Buying puts simply are more risky. Put debit spreads reduce premium and put a cap to the max profit. For example, when most of the market makers were jacking off to SPY rallying up to 450 back in end of March 2022 (for no reason) I bought SPY 450-440 put debit spread expiring May 20 (after FED meeting) for 2.70$ per contract. Sold those for $8.00 (\~200% profit) at early May....

**price/expiry/spread/quantity tactics:** Buying put debit spreads when SPY is going upwards (for no reason, without positive news) is the time to buy, and HOLD. My contract value went to 2$ at some point, but I held as the reasoning was clear for me. For expiry this is best if you give 4-5 weeks for strategy to play out.  As for how big of a spread, I prefer 10, this gives maximum value of $1000 if strategy plays out. I typically try to sell at 80% profit before expiry. Quantity for you? Really depends on how much investments you got in the market and are trying to hedge. Accordingly you can buy quantity of put debit spreads contracts.

**Reasoning why it works: Warning, this only works in your favor if you are invested in the market like I am (like invested in SPY, VOO, MSFT, AAPL kind of stocks). For this example lets assume about $15k of  investments in large cap, small cap, stocks/funds.**

Scenario 1)Market declines: If the market declines 5% (which constantly keeps happening) you are down 750$. Now at the same time, towards expiry the put debit spread has gained in value and closer to maximum profit of 730$ (assuming a 10 point spread like 450-440 SPY, bought at 2.70$ per contract).... Note the spread gains value towards 1000$ very close to expiry, suggestion is to sell at 80% profit. In this case you will be up .8\*730 = $584. Hence this minimizes the overall losses to 750-584$ = 166$.

Scenario 2) Market is up 5%: This rarely happens these days...Even if it does stay up while the put debit spread is expiring, your investments are up 5% by 750$. And assume put debit spread gone to 0$, expiring worthless... in this case you are up by 750-270 = 480$.

Scenario 3) Market stays flat....this is never the case in these times. Even if it does, this is why it is beneficial to buy the spreads atm (at the market) price and not deep OTM. This way if strategy doesn't play out, you can still time the highs and lows in the days putting a limit order.

**Why this strategy and not just DCA?**

There is a legitimate and serious concern that SPY may go to 300-350$ in the coming months if it hits bear markets. More of not ""if"" but rather ""when"" it hits.  I do not want to run the risk of losing my investments by such a large percentage, and hence hedging seems to be the best option at the moment. Of course keep cash on the side and invest as it allows. And, given the conditions, buying these spreads and selling at 50-80% profits seems to be the best strategy.

Positions: SPY 400-390 Put debit spread expiring June 21st (why? this is after CPI data and FED meeting, although I feel FED meeting may not cause much issue, as Powell announces everything upfront). Bought at $3.21 per contract, already up 60% as of right now).

There is a good chance of bull run to 420$, could add more if that happens. I wish it happens really and these debit spreads goes to ZERO..... I will be more happy to see my investments go up and not worry about hedging.

I will be getting a new job with Company B. I can roll over my 401k into the new company account but the loan is set to become a withdrawal which is subject to taxes and early withdrawal penalties. Correct me if I’m wrong but I’ll have to pay 24% federal income tax, 7% NJ state tax and a 10% irs early withdrawal penalty.

personalfinance,Is converting to solar worth it?,"Tis the season for unsolicited door to door sales, and we had a solar sales person knock the other day. Since we'd talked about solar before, my husband and I decided to at least entertain the pitch to see what was what. It seems...almost too good to be true which means it likely is, but I'm hoping for some outside perspective.

Currently we are set up with our city's provider. We pay between $100-200/mo for electric - higher in winter/summer when we're using the HVAC more often obviously. 

Other relevant info - we live in an older home. We were recently quoted 6k to upgrade our electrical box by a completely unaffiliated electrical company that has done work for us in the past. 

We plan to stay in this house at least 12 years, until our youngest graduates high school.

What the solar company is offering:

1. Panels would be placed at no cost to us. They secure all permitting, etc. 
2. Panels would be owned - we would have a ""commercial"" loan for them and payments would be applied monthly for 25 years (approx $150/month) at which time they would be ours. No penalty for prepayment
3. Federal tax credit for upwards of 10k for 2022
4. Solar company would complete the following, in addition to solar panel installation: re-insulating the attic; installing solar attic fan; sealing up home if needed; upgrading our electrical box (this is a big one given above quote); installing smart electrical meter (we are on the outdated kind); installing smart thermostat
5. Any additional energy we produce but do not use would be ""sold"" back to our provider and applied as credits to our account, to be used either for our gas bill, or for months when we use more than we make
6. Total cost over 25 years comes to roughly $41,000 

I like the concept of solar from an environmental perspective, and the upgrades to the house are a nice incentive. But I feel like we were sucked in by the pitch and need to get some perspective before moving forward. I have already reached out to our realtor and lender who are both local and have a lot of insight into the market, to ask their opinion on how this affects property value (sales guy obviously said it raises it considerably) and selling power (because if we did sell, loan would have to be transferred to the next buyer). 

I have seen several homes in our neighborhood getting panels, and we do get an obscene amount of sun (SW facing house in Denver area with no tree obstruction). If we can capitalize on that while being more eco friendly that would be ideal.  But outside of the info here, I am really clueless about home solar.

Unless you have insider knowledge you can’t predict this. Hence Bitcoin investment is gambling, especially in the short term.

The rational big players would only put their “play money” into crypto and will cash out when they need that money back.  This is because if they have fiat currency they can grow it through accumulation of assets like shares.

Right now with economic downturn the big players need their play money back as a reserve so the price of bitcoin has dropped.

Bitcoin price will align to the world economic state rather than be a hedge against the economic state changing.

This will be the case until we see bitcoin become more of a transactional system of payment integral to day to day life. And realistically transactions are more efficiently achieved by the banks at the moment in terms of raw energy, security and user experience.

The game changer will be when quantum computing arrives and how tech responds. If encryption can be broken by anyone able to afford a quantum computer then the trust that underpins the entire payment system is in danger. This will impact both fiat and cryptos.

Imagine your NetBank password being packet sniffed. Now imagine your private key on your crypto wallet being reverse engineered.

At that point the only trust you can have is in physical goods and physical paper trails showing ownership.

If Crypto can beat the banks to addressing this problem then it can become the de facto transactional system and the purchasing power of a capped coin like bitcoin will always grow as the population grows.",cryptocurrency,1652997873

investing,I'm calling Powell's bluff,"In short I predict Jerome Powell and the Fed are talking a tough game on inflation, but will soften later this year leading to a market rally. I also believe we will have a minor recession at worst. Putting this here to refer back to and see if I was on the money.

# 

# &gt; What Will Play Out This Year

The Fed is  jawboning markets down to cool inflation without having to actually jack interest rates up. This is because they can't for an extended period of time. The US government has too much debt to afford large repayments. Furthermore it will become difficult to complete treasury auctions when the fed is selling not buying.

**The Fed doesn't want to kill stocks**, Powell loves the stock market.

In practicality his purpose is to keep debt borrowing costs as low as possible for the US government. This Fed has constantly erred on the side of accommodative, they cut rates in 2019 when there was barely an excuse. They will jump on any excuse to drop rates and print print print. The only time they cannot is when inflation is so out of control it's pissing people off. They're not different people now, they just are talking different.

**Powell faces 4 dragons right now:**

1. Post-covid supply bottlenecks,
2. Elevated food/energy from Ukraine war
3. Supply bottlenecks from China lockdown
4. The inflationary echoes of the covid printing bender and stimulus

Notice something?

All 4 of those will resolve by themselves at some point. While we're not going to wind back the past inflation, we are on trajectory for it to come down. Last month on month reading was .3% or 3.7% annualized. Considering current events not bad. Many leading indicators I use are rolling over.

Inflation will remain elevated for a couple years because the Fed is half heartedly tightening with negative real yields and minor balance sheet reduction. But in order for inflation to keep going up, prices have to keep going up from their current elevated levels. In the near future the 4 dragons will begin to die and this will only help.

**Therefore later this year I expect a softening from the Fed** after a few good inflation prints. This will cause a rally in stocks, not breaking all time highs but higher then now. It doesn't mean we're going back to the 20/21 era, the fed will not be going crazy like that again for a long time. But it's going to look a lot rosier then now.

This means **depression fears are also overblown**, the problem is valuation like the dot.com crash, not a liquidity crunch like 2008. We still have an extra $5t floating around on the feds balance sheet and negative real rates. Borrowing at 4% while inflation's at 9% is a good deal. We may have a technical recession given difficult short term economic events, but it will be mild and short lived.

# 

# &gt; How To Make Money

**Big money is sitting in cash**, the money isn't gone and the cost of borrowing money is still below inflation - making margin loan expansion likely. This means at the first sign of clear skies later this year we're going to get a big rally as liquidity rushes back in.

As predicted **Hypergrowth is oversold** and there's quality names trading at attractive prices. This is the worst time to buy inflation or recession hedges as they're already overbought. Trade the cascade as sectors collapse one by one, buy what has collapsed, don't sit in what will collapse. Don't overpay.

As outlined in a past update, developed nations have no choice but to devalue their currency through persistently elevated inflation. Emerging markets really don't have our inflation problems for the most part since they didn't print. So **EM is about to have an era of outperformance** in stocks and bonds as it enjoys a greater share of global consumption.

Calculating for inflation, real GDP growth and additional cash on the Fed balance sheet the **fair value for the S&amp;P 500 is around 3800**. Anything below that is a steal considering I doubt we're going to have a major economic collapse.

In bear markets correlations become 1. Meaning everything falls in unison by sector, regardless of which companies are actual stand outs. There's too much going on for accurate pricing. When investors panic every bad event that could happen is more then priced in. I always try and buy on panic. **Incredible mispricing's are being created right now, buy them**.

So in short BUY GROWTH STOCKS. The good ones.

# U.S. may be barreling toward recession in next year, more experts say

Abha Bhattarai  5/19/2022

The U.S. economy could be heading for a recession in the next year, according to growing warnings from banks and economists, as a sudden bout of pessimism hammers financial markets, which on Thursday spiraled further from recent highs.

Although major swaths of the economy — including the job market and consumer spending — remain robust, there are mounting worries that rising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, after years of near-zero interest rates, could cause a sudden retrenchment. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points so far this year, while officials are signaling more aggressive increases could be necessary to cool the economy. Continued uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are adding to the uneasiness.

Financial markets fell again on Thursday, a day after the DJIA suffered its worst drop of the year. The S&amp;P 500 inched further into bear market territory (i.e. 20 % drop from the most recent peak — after Wednesday’s sell-off wiped out more than 4 % of its value.

“Recession risks are high — uncomfortably high — and rising,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “For the economy to navigate through without suffering a downturn, we need some very deft policymaking from the Fed and a bit of luck.”

I'm on month 16 out of 24, and I have gathered the funds to pay it off 8 months early. This financial institution is not a big one, so they implemented an early prepayment penalty to protect themselves which means that for the remaining time of the loan (8 months), they'd be increasing the interest from 37% to 58% for the remaining interest if I choose to pay early.

From an emotional standpoint (myself), I just want to take the loss and finally move on from this. Originally, my dad was paying for this as it's his responsibility, but it got to a point that he can't pay it and I've been covering for him the past 4-5 months.

From a rational standpoint (my dad), thinks that I should just continue paying monthly for the remaining 8 months at the 37% interest rate and I shouldn't ""pay more than what it's actually owed"".

stocks,China’s Stimulus Tops $5 Trillion as Covid Zero Hits Economy,"&gt;China’s plans to bolster growth as Covid outbreaks and lockdowns crush activity will see a whopping $5.3 trillion pumped into its economy this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The figure -- based on Bloomberg’s calculation of monetary and fiscal measures announced so far -- equates to roughly a third of China’s $17 trillion economy, but is actually smaller than the stimulus in 2020 when the pandemic first hit. That suggests even more could be spent if the economy fails to pick up from its current funk -- a [possibility](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-18/china-has-enough-policy-room-for-economic-challenges-li-says) raised by Premier Li Keqiang earlier this week.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bloomberg’s calculation of financial support pledged so far for 2022 amounts to 35.5 trillion yuan. On the fiscal side, we’ve added China’s general budget expenditure with the amount of money issued through local government special bonds and tax and fee cuts. Monetary policy support includes hundreds of billions of yuan in liquidity unleashed by the People’s Bank of China through policy loans, cuts to reserve ratios for banks, as well as cheap loans to help small businesses and green projects during the pandemic.

personalfinance,should I pay off my debt?,"I (24m) currently make roughly 43k per year base (no overtime)
Within the past month I've made a very solid budget for myself and planned to stick to it for the next year.
I am currently contributing 5% of my income to my 401k as that's matched by employer and I'm putting 500 a month into a Roth IRA to max that throughout the year.
I have about 600 monthly I can contribute to debt and planned to put it all towards my student loans (20k federal loans).

I recently found out I have $1500 of medical bills in collection. Long story short my parent lied to me about paying for medical expenses when I was in college. These were sent to collections in mid 2018.
For the medical debts in collection, I have heard about SOL but am pretty unknowledgeable if it would apply for my situation. The period for my state is 6 years, so it's coming up close.
My main question is should I pay off these bills or just wait on the SOL and what would be the effects of both choices?
I have not talked to the collection agency besides through credit karma in attempt to dispute the debts. Would this reset the SOL period?
Also, would not paying them hurt my credit worse than what it already is? My credit is currently 680.

Finally, a follow up question: would it be wise to cut Roth IRA contributions in order to pay off student loans faster?",finance,1653041076
CryptoCurrency,I asked an Anti-Crypto Sub with 100k members for their top arguments against Bitcoin and this was the 10 best they could come up with.,"&gt;**1.** The existence of exchanges has made Bitcoins core claims completely irrelevant.

&gt;**2.** it is, at best, a toy. in reality it's a massive disaster. to people who were scammed. to the environment. to victims of ransomware. the list goes on and on. right now a million crypto bros are dreaming up ways to do even more harm. and most damning of all, this is for absolutely nothing. there is no problem that a blockchain can solve that isn't better solved by something else.

&gt;**3.** You guys ask this shit every day, it gets so god damned old. You guys are so fucking obnoxious I can't stand you.

&gt;**4.** Simply put, crypto is nothing. It offers nothing. provides nothing. it is people speculating on the value of nothing being worth something but in the end it’s.nothing.  if you held a jar of a hobos dick cheese in your hand, you have something more intrinsically valuable than any amount of crypto. at least you have a jar which has its uses. For a bunch of people who think this is the mega game changer, they sure are spending a lot of time online, advertising money, and paid celebrities to try to convince us how amazing it is. Yet I don’t see the mass adoption 13 years later

&gt; **5.** What interest rate would you charge for a 30 year mortgage lent out in any non-stablecoin of your choice (because at best, stablecoins are only meant to mirror their pegged currency)? If you can't give me an interest rate that approaches rates used today, then your currency will never (and **can't** ever) be adopted as a true currency. If you're just using it to gamble, then gamble away. Just don't make any allusions about a possible future of actual adoption.

&gt;**6.** There would be no bitcoin in the madman future someone is preparing for. Unfortunately that's against and old argument for crypto. They keep changing their 'purpose' usually it contradicts itself and there is a new 'purpose' everyday.

&gt;**7.** Volatility makes it useless. If I gave you $100 in BTC and it tanks in a day, I did well and you did not. Or the opposite and it goes up. Someone always loses in the transaction. It’s up and down so much even a few percent in a matter of hours. Sure that’s not a big deal for $20-$50 but it is if we’re talking thousands. My “fiat” doesn’t change that much that quick.

&gt;**8.** Because it's a negative sum Ponzi/pyramid hybrid scheme that has absolutely no real world value.

&gt;**9.** It’s just like fiat cash, only way less secure, far less convenient, and with unbelievable teller fees.It’s a solution in search of a problem.

&gt;**10.** My top argument is Crypto is reinventing what we already have. Fractional reserve banking = stablecoin. Fast transactions (lightning) = Visa. Distributed ledger = database  Exchanges = banks. Carbon converted to CO2 en masse = mining.

**This Subs Top responses (after 24hrs)**

**1.** 
&gt;Although 90% of people are still incredibly ignorant when it comes to crypto I admit some of the arguments arnt exactly a million miles away from reality. The space is unfortunately awash with scammers, ponzi schemes and just dogshit tokens with no utility. Maybe we need another crypto winter to wash all that shit down the drain with the rest of the turds.

**2.**
&gt; if you held a jar of a hobos dick cheese in your hand

wasn't expecting to see this in an argument against crypto today but here we are

**3.**
&gt;3. You guys ask this shit every day, it gets so god damned old. You guys are so fucking obnoxious I can't stand you.

This is actually a veiled critique of the Bitcoin consensus mechanism, and questions the repetitive nature of proof of work.

**4.**
&gt;Big fan of answer number 3 😂

**5.**
&gt;I feel like #3 has some merit.

**6.**
&gt;5. What interest rate would you charge for a 30 year mortgage lent out in any non-stablecoin of your choice (because at best, stablecoins are only meant to mirror their pegged currency)? If you can't give me an interest rate that approaches rates used today, then your currency will never (and can't ever) be adopted as a true currency. If you're just using it to gamble, then gamble away. Just don't make any allusions about a possible future of actual adoption.

He's actually not wrong with this criticism.  

&gt;4. Simply put, crypto is nothing\[...dick cheese...\]. Yet I don’t see the mass adoption 13 years later

I don't think anything disruptive technology had mass adoption within 13 years, ever.  First car was manufactured in 1887. Mass adoption came 20+ years later with the Model T in 1908. Internet was invented in the 1960s.  Computers in the 50s.  Mass adoption didn't come until mid 2000s.  First smartphone was invented in 1992.  Blackberry's and iPhones didn't see mass adoption until the mid-to-late 2000s. 13 years is a very, very short time, and adoption is growing every day

**7.**
&gt;I don't know how crypto is ""freeing"" anyone or whatever.

**8.**
&gt;A lot of these arguments are spot on. 99% of people buy bitcoin only to be able to flip it at a higher price. It doesn't have intrinsic value as an asset. It also isn't being used like a currency like fiat is.

**9.**

&gt;The dollar still rules.  You don’t spend any crypto and if a business does take it, they convert it to cash and all you did was spend more on gas fees.  So crypto is more like a commodity.  It is only worth something because the community says so.

personalfinance,need help with selling car/buying a new one/refinancing my auto loan,"hi everyone i’m gonna try and give all the info without going too much into detail 

my auto loan is financed at 9.8% (I know, I had good credit but was out of college and virtually no credit history) and after 2.5 years I have paid it down and have $6000 left. 

My car’s transmission is shot now, I have to either replace the transmission (6k) or replace the car. 

The wholesaler is going to give me $5000 for the car and he said he would pay it directly to the bank, meaning I only have to pay $1000 left on my balance to be able to get the title.

Here’s what I’d like to do going forward I just don’t know the best way to get there and how to get the best rates 

My credit is a bit lower than when i bought the car, not by much, but still about 20 points or so — but now I have years of credit history and never missed a payment. 

I would like to see what I can do about:

1. getting the title to the car - what exactly do I have to do? 

2. Try to refinance before paying off (if that’s even a thing?) to really just be able to pay anything less than the $6000 I have left as the payoff amount. 

3. possibly try to turn my current auto loan into a new one for a new car and just try to keep the same company, just work out a monthly payment for my new car 

I really don’t know if these things are possible, especially with fair-good credit. I really just want to be able to get this car off my hands, get a new car, and just keep the same (or similar) monthly payment without shelling out a bunch of cash for a down payment. If I can refinance there and get a lower interest rate that would be like killing two birds with one stone, but I will take what I can get lol.

**VMware bugs abused to deliver Mirai malware, exploit Log4Shell**  
Researchers say a GitHub proof-of-concept exploitation of recently announced VMware bugs is being abused by hackers in the wild who are focused on using them to deliver Mirai denial-of-service malware and exploit the Log4Shell vulnerability. “Researchers analyzed the attacks and payloads detected by Barracuda systems between April to May and found a steady stream of attempts to exploit two recently uncovered VMware vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960”says a report from Barracuda. CISA has released an emergency bulletin that requires emergency action from Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to either immediately implement the updates or remove the affected software from their network until the updates can be applied.

**93% of orgs have suffered a data-related business disruption**  
The 2022 State of Ransomware and Disaster Preparedness survey from the International Data Corporation (IDC), found that, last year, 60% medium and large organizations in North America and Western Europe suffered irrecoverable data loss, up from 43% the previous year. Seventy-nine percent of organizations indicated they activated a disaster recovery response over the last twelve months, with nearly two thirds (61%) attributing these incidents to ransomware or other malware. Respondents reported an average of 19.3 attacks (all types) and 2.3 ransomware attacks in the past year, with 93% of organizations suffering a data-related business disruption over the same period.

**Phishing attacks surge in Q1**  
Security researchers from Kroll found that phishing emails as an initial attack vector increased 54% on the year in Q1. This rise caused incidents tied to email compromises to surpass ransomware for the first time in a year. Kroll pins this uptick on a rise in activity from both Emotet and IceID malware. Once attackers used phishing for this initial beachhead, attack methods varied widely, from dropping ransomware and malware, to in some cases attempting extortion just based off stolen data without any backing encryption attempt. Generally attackers did not only attempt phishing emails as an initial attack vector, but also attempted to exploit vulnerabilities like ProxyLogon and Log4Shell.

**iPhones are vulnerable to attack even when turned off**  
A team of researchers from Germany’s Technical University of Darmstadt discovered that iPhone features including Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) technologies, which have access to sensitive info via iPhone’s Secure Element (SE), stay on via low power mode (LPM), even when modern iPhones are powered down. Researchers assert this could potentially allow an attacker to load malware to the device and access secure data such as a user’s credit card info, banking details or even digital car keys. While Apple has not responded to the findings, researchers say one potential solution would be to add a hardware-based switch which disconnects the battery while an iPhone is powered down.

**North Korean devs pose as US freelancers to aid DRPK govt hackers**  
The U.S. government is warning that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is dispatching its IT workers to get freelance jobs at companies across the world to obtain privileged access that is sometimes used to facilitate cyber intrusions. To get into the desired position, the North Korea's IT workers often pretend to be teleworkers located in the U.S. or other non-sanctioned country. To obfuscate their true identity and pass as an individual from a non-sanctioned country, North Korean IT workers often change their names, use virtual private network (VPN) connections, or use IP addresses from other regions. The US Treasury has published an advisory that helps organizations identify these workers.

**Costa Rican ransomware rhetoric somehow gets uglier**  
The Conti ransomware group posted messages on their leak site notifying the Costa Rican government it raised its ransom demands to $20 million worth of cryptocurrency, and threatening to “overthrow” the government of newly elected President Rodrigo Chaves. Conti already leaked 97% of 670GB of data stolen from government agencies, leading the government to declare a state of emergency. Conti’s ransomware attacks have had significant impacts on digital services from the government, leading the Finance Ministry to tell citizens to calculate taxes by hand and pay them at local banks, rather than through an online portal.

**Trying to fix open source supply chain security**  
After meeting with officials in the Biden administration, the Linux Foundation and Open Source Security Foundation announced plans to invest over $150 million over the next two years to make the open source software supply chain more secure. This comes as part of an overall 10-point plan to boost open source security. A group of tech companies including Amazon, Ericsson, Google, Intel, Microsoft and VMware already pledged $30 million in initial funding. As part of this, Google Cloud said it would launch an  Open Source Maintenance Crew, a dedicated team of engineers who will work directly with upstream open source maintainers.

**D-Wave deploys first US-based Advantage quantum system**  
Quantum computing outfit D-Wave Systems has announced availability of an Advantage quantum computer accessible via the cloud but physically located in the US. D-Wave reported that the newly deployed system is the first of its Advantage line of quantum computers available via its Leap quantum cloud service. The new system is based at the University of Southern California, as part of the USC-Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center hosted at USC’s Information Sciences Institute, a factor that may encourage US organizations interested in evaluating quantum computing that are likely to want the assurance of accessing facilities based in the same country.

personalfinance,Can You Sell a House and Not Pay Off the Remaining Mortgage?,"With interest rates going back up I was thinking about something. My current mortgage has a very low interest rate, but I know we don’t want to stay in this house forever either. Could I sell my house, keep all of the money from the sale (I’m going to ignore realtor fees for the sake of simplicity) and use it all as a huge down payment on a future house? 

Let’s say my current mortgage is a $300k loan, with a 3% APR. If I sold my house for $300k, but wanted a house that was $400k but couldn’t get a new mortgage for less than a 5% interest rate, could I put $300k down on the home and then just take a new loan out for $100k to pay the difference? I’d technically be paying two mortgages, but only paying the higher interest on a $100k instead of the full $400k.

stocks,2022 is just 2008; except now the chickens are coming home to roost.,"Due to the destruction of unions, alongside deindustrialization of the heartland, the standards of living of the average American have been slowly in decline since the 1980s and the 1990s because of stagnating wages and lack of decent job opportunities for the uneducated. To offset this decline, and to maintain societal stability, there was a significant transition towards funding the American lifestyle by increasing amounts of debt. Education debt increased. Medical debt increased. Housing debt increased. The Federal debt increased to maintain our military and retirement social programs.

But obviously, because wages stagnated, it was merely a matter of time before debt alone could not sustain our lifestyles. This status quo finally broke in 2008 with the great financial crisis and the housing market crash revealed the house of cards. This should have been the wake up call moment...but it wasn't. We instituted QE measures and dropped interests rates to try and encourage the recovery....and then when just didn't stop. Why? Because low interest rates, make it more appealing to ....you guessed it....take on debt.

This worked, which is why we saw a bull market throughout the 2010s. At least, it worked until we face another crisis, and we used up the last of our tools.

Now the chickens are finally coming home to roost. We have to raise interest rates or the dollar will just become worthless. This is causing what I call, the Great Deleveraging. No more debt to keep us happy anymore. They say it's supply chains, putin, covid....they can all be somewhat influential. But to ignore the glaring role of accumulating debt to finance our unsustainable lifestyles is ignorance.",finance,1653059325

CryptoCurrency,looking for a new exchange that is compatible with a ledgar nano x,"So the last two days has been a shit show  with coinbase support. I have been restricted on buying/ selling crypto as well as sending crypto 
After waiting on the phone they said I need to re verify my account and after multiple failed attempts after following all the rules  I exceeded  my attempts for the day and have to wait till tomorrow to try again

Needless to say is I'm fed up with coinbase and am looking for a new exchange that I can use that will also allow me to buy and move my coins to my cold wallet 

So any suggestions ?

I also have a Ledgar nano x and I saw that ledgar live has the capability  to buy crypto and I'm curious  to see what yall think of buying straight from ledgar live  is it worth it ? Or is it better to buy from a different exchange 

Would love some guidance  on a easier process of buying crypto and transferring it off the exchange

personalfinance,Navigating a Cash Crunch,"Hi all,

So my wife and I have a 7 month old baby and a dog. 

We currently owe roughly 230K on the mortgage of our current home.  3000 square feet in a low cost of living area.

In April we closed on a second home for $475K.   3800 square feet in low (but not quite as low) cost of living area.   We get possession of that home in mid June.

The two homes are 2 hours drive from each other.  The new home brings us closer to family.

We were hoping that the current home would sell quickly (we believe that $300K is reasonable) and planned to use the proceeds:

* to pay for the moving company
* have a new water filtration system or reverse osmosis system installed in the new house to remediate the naturally occurring arsenic in the local aquifer (It's very common in the area we are moving to).
* re-build the emergency ""screw you"" money fund.  Fortunately, I'm very happy with my job, they seem to be quite happy with me, and the company is doing well.

Well things haven't been going as planned for the sale of the old home and with the dog and the baby, making viewings work and getting out of the house for inspections has proven to be difficult (and expensive with gas costs these days).  We're leaning towards taking the house off the market and putting it back on after we move.

The problem is I only have about $15K in cash on hand and about $7K in a brokerage account composed of passive index funds.  It has about $2K in unrealized losses due to the state of the market currently.   I'd really like to hold onto these funds.  

I have $6K in federal student loans.  I'm actually slowly dragging out the student loan payments because my company has a benefit to pay these (they offer $150/month free money).  

My wife has about $40K in student loans.  We aren't paying those currently due to the pandemic.

We owe about $18K on our second car.  The first one's been paid off for years.

We have 2 credit cards which we pay in full each month for day-to-day expenses.

Working the mortgage for the second home into the budget wasn't much of a challenge.  Once we start paying utilities as well and once the student loan payments start again, it might get trickier.

I am very lucky, my situation is a lot better than many, I know.  But at the same time, I'm rather uneasy about the situation and I don't really see a great way out.   A short term loan to cover the filtration system and possibly moving costs seems reasonable.

Thanks for listening to my rant.  I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts.  Any advice or reassurance would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1653062232
CryptoCurrency,How is the current market any different than May 2021?,"I hadn’t followed the markets until Jan 2021. Since then, I believe the biggest crash until recently was in May 2021 - tons of ATH shredded. The prices I’m seeing now of BTC, ETH, and most (not all) alts are pretty reminiscent of that. We came out of that bear in 2 months (by mid July) and then saw a ton more ATH. I’m not expecting a rebound like last year, but it would be nice. I just would like a little more insight. Can someone explain if/how this current bear is different than the one from May-July 2021?

Edit - thanks for the answers. I’m a crypto smooth brain trying to understand more. It seems that tightening monetary policy and even more inflation + war in Ukraine are the most popular answers.

personalfinance,Best way to pay off a HELOC while balancing savings goals,"I'm helping a relative of mine with some finances (English is not their native language, so really I'm just doing some translating, explaining, and a bit of advice) and they have a prime rate HELOC with a 10-year interest-only period after which the loan is re-amortized to a 30-year fixed.

My understanding is that the prime rate is based off the fed's current rates. My relative wants to prioritize saving money first and foremost. I'm trying to help them figure out how to best save while also get rid of this loan, b/c the nature of variable interest rate while rates are rising has me concerned. But I just don't really know much about HELOCs, so I'm not sure what is the best way to go about it.

Some options I came up with:

\- They told me they could pay it all off in 4 years if they really tightened their budget and didn't save much. Realistically, I'd guess it's more like 5-6 years if you consider ""life happens"" unexpected expenses

\- They could calculate and pay it off over the course of the next 10 years, to avoid the re-amortization into a fixed loan, and save/invest the rest of the money not going towards HELOC

\- I don't know if they can do this for sure, but I read online that some lenders will let you lock the rate on a HELOC? Is that something worth looking into?

\- edit to add: Refinancing into a fixed rate loan is probably also an option

\- What else??

Again, I have very limited understanding of HELOCs! Sorry if some of this doesn't make sense. Open to any and all advice!",finance,1653063767

Based on the flowchart, it seems that debt under 4% would just continue at the minimum payments while you max out other things.

stocks,"Full DD on $GOED, severely undervalued, possible multi-bagger","TL;DR: price target of $2.25, $3.6, $4.5, $5 (see valuation)

Goedecker (GOED) is an e-commerce business that sells appliances and furniture in the US. A reverse merger happened in Q2 2021 which caused massive share dilution and financial misrepresentation. The legacy Goedecker acquired Appliances Connections in a deal valued at 200 million (via share dilution etc). Legacy Goedecker is not a very well managed business, making 56 million revenue in 2018 and 55 million in 2019. Appliances Connections on the other hand is the real deal, making around 300 million revenue in 2020, 540 million revenue in 2021, and currently expected 640 million revenue in 2022. [https://www.appliancesconnection.com](https://www.appliancesconnection.com)

The best part is that the management team from appliances connection moved to the current Goedecker along with the CEO and others. They have made management changes and hired new talents. More can be viewed in ([https://investor.goedekers.com/overview/default.aspx](https://investor.goedekers.com/overview/default.aspx)) and their presentation ([https://s25.q4cdn.com/225826556/files/doc\_presentations/2022/05/GOED-Q1-2022-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://s25.q4cdn.com/225826556/files/doc_presentations/2022/05/GOED-Q1-2022-Investor-Presentation.pdf)). Their CEO Albert Fouerti ([https://thecorporatemagazine.com/building-a-brand-albert-fouerti-business-leader/](https://thecorporatemagazine.com/building-a-brand-albert-fouerti-business-leader/)) started Appliances Connection with his brother Elie in 1999 and is now a well established, growing e-commerce furniture and appliances retailer.

Competitors that has similar business model: Overstock, Wayfair, AJ Madison

Competitors in appliances and furniture industry: Lowes, Ikea, Home Depot, Best Buy, Sears etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# First of all lets check out their financials:

Goedecker is a misunderstood company, with a market cap of 170 million it is not on most people (and funds) screeners, because of this it is currently severely undervalued, exacerbated by the fall in various stock indices.

Secondly, the reverse merger happened in Q2 2021 so their combined revenue and earnings are only shown for Q3 2021, Q4 2021, and Q1 2022. This means their FY2021 revenue and earnings and not a clear representation of the business since Q1 and Q2 are 'hidden' in stock screeners.

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1810140&amp;owner=exclude](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1810140&amp;owner=exclude)

According to the 10K, FY2021 revenue is at 362 million (doesn't include Q1 and Q2), likewise net income is at 7.6 million without taking the first half of the year in consideration. Then looking at the pro forma which: 

&gt;  
The following unaudited pro forma results presented below (in thousands) include the effects of the AC and AG Acquisitions as if they had been consummated as of January 1, 2020, with adjustments to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisitions.

Shows (**proforma**) FY2021 revenue is at 541 million, while net income is at 27.9 million.

Taking pro forma into account (according to earnings call transcripts and ER [https://roic.ai/transcripts/GOED?y=2022&amp;q=1](https://roic.ai/transcripts/GOED?y=2022&amp;q=1)), we can interpret the revenue and earnings as:

|in millions|Q1 2020|Q2 2020|Q3 2020|Q4 2020|Q1 2021|Q2 2021|Q3 2021|Q4 2021|Q1 2022|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|66.8|91.5|102.2|109.7|123.7|140.1|141.9|142.7|152.8|
|Net income|2.6|0.8|(3.2)|(11.4)|15.6|17.3|6.5|(11.5)|5.9|

* I've calculated the revenue as Q3 revenue = Nine month ended proforma - six month ended proforma etc. 
* Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4 = 548.4 million which doesn't add up to 541 million, this is likely variances in accounting and if anyone knows why please comment below
* The sum of FY2021 net income extracted from various 10Q pro forma accounts doesn't add up to the 27.9 million stated in the FY2021 10K. This is likely also due to accounting differences, most likely older pro forma did not take into account the loss occurred from Goedecker's side.
* The high Q1 &amp; Q2 2021 net income is likely from tax rebates due to covid and net loss in 2020, although this is unspecified in 10-Q.
* Take the chart above with a grain of salt. However the company confirmed:
   * 541 million revenue in FY2021
   * 27.9 million net income in FY2021
   * 370 million revenue in FY2020
   * \-11.2 million net loss in FY2020. (possibly used to tax harvest FY2021 Q1 and Q2 tax rebates, explaining the high numbers)
* Eitherway, take the above information only as a reference as pro forma and reverse mergers are difficult to calculate and often unaudited.
* Below are some footnotes in the FY2021 10-K which I think would help us understand some of the issues above.

&gt;*Income tax benefit (expense)*. We had an income tax net benefit of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to an income tax expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result of the Appliances Connection Acquisition, the Company is able utilize previously derived net operating losses, as it is more likely than not that the Company will be profitable.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Net Income (Loss)*. As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had net income of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included net income of $30.6 million from Appliances Connection for the period from June 2, 2021 to December 31, 2021, as compared to a net loss of $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $29.2 million, or 135.6%. Excluding Appliances Connection, our net loss increased by $1.4 million, or 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021.

# Future Growth:

On the Q1-2022 Earnings Call, the CEO reiterated their Q4 target that:

&gt;We forecast high teens to low 20 sales growth for the year compared to 2021 pro forma sales and gross margins and adjusted EBITDA margins relatively flat to our 2021 full year pro forma results, which were 23.3% and 9% respectively.

With revenue of 152.8 million in Q1 2022, and their expectation of 16-22% revenue growth rate from 541 million (FY2021), we can extrapolate the revenue will likely fall somewhere between 620 to 660 million.

Analysts (only 2 lol) [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOED/analysis?p=GOED](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOED/analysis?p=GOED) expects:

|in millions|FY2022|FY2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|636 (17.6% growth)|731 (15% growth)|
|EPS est. (avg)|0.21|0.3|

&amp;#x200B;

As stated in Q4 and Q1 earnings call, their quarterly fill rate is at 3.5%

&gt;The definition of fill rate is the percentage of customer orders you're able to meet without running out of stock at any given time. A strong fill rate is at or near 100%, meaning you're able to fulfill all of the wholesale sales you make without stockouts, backorders, or lost sales.

Albert Fouerti in Q1 2022 Earnings call

&gt;Unfortunately, I mean, it's almost holding steady to what it was in the past, I would say Q4 of 2021. We're looking anywhere from about 63.5%, 63% of fill rate. We're still struggling with the same struggles that we had in the past. Hopefully, we're looking forward to the next Q2 or Q3 to get some type of relief in the supply chain.

Albert Fouerti on Q3 2021 Earnings call

&gt;Our historical highs anywhere from eighty five percent to ninety percent and that's really what we're trying to get to in 2022

Increasing fill rate back to even 75% will increase their sales by at least 10% which is a bonus on top of their organic e-commerce appliances/furniture sales growth.

Albert Fouerti in multiple Earnings calls

&gt;We continue to believe that we are well on the way to becoming a company with $1 billion in annual sales in the next few years

# Now the juicy part... Valuation:

*Currently trading at $1.6 (as of writing)*

Oustanding shares = 106.4 million

Warrants (1:1) = 92.5 million (weighted-avg exercise price of $2.3 with contractual life of 4.42yrs)

* What warrants does is essentially give investors the right to purchase the share at the exercise price, the company will issue these share (dilution), however the company receives the cash which adds to their enterprise value  


**Assumption 1 (Pessimistic basis):**

$GOED trading below weighted avg $2.3 so warrant dilution is minimal. Outstanding shares remains at 106.4 million

Net income is lower than FY2021, from 27 million --&gt; 20 million

20/106.4 = 0.189 EPS

Assume expected revenue growth of 15% CAGR, PE of 12:

**0.189\*12 = $2.27 (42% upside)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumption 2 (bear case):**

As supply chain crisis subsides, fill rate will return to 85%, revenue continuing to grow at 15-18%. Profit margins increase to 5-6% as freight cost etc. is reduced, revenue hits CEO's expectation of $1 billion.

Net income = 1,000,000,000\*5.5% = 55 million 

With their current authorised 25m buyback programme (blackout period ended 2 days ago), possibility reduce share dilution from warrants slightly --&gt; 180 shares outstanding

EPS = 55/180 = 0.3

Analysts also expect 0.3 to 0.38 EPS in 2023, assuming 15 PE 

0.3\*15 = $4.5 (181% upside)

Analysts have a price target of $5 (low) and $8 (high)

# Catalyst:

* Next quarterly report will display the correct TTM info (21Q3, 21Q4, 22Q1, 22Q2) which will help stock screeners. Also gain coverage
* $25 million authorised buyback plan that started 2 days ago due to blackout periods
* Rebranding happening 'in the next few weeks' according to the CEO
* Introduction in the russel 2000 (unlikely but may happen)
* General recovery of S&amp;P

# Risks:

* Cost of living crisis, lowering demand for appliances/furnitures and reducing revenue and earnings
* Supply chain shock lasting (or worsening) far beyond 2023 which hurts profit margins
* Recession, interest rate rising, general market downturn
* Proforma results are unaudited and hard to say whether it's correct or not, also since it was a private company, appliances connections doesn't disclose any financial statements prior to 2019.
* Risk of warrant dilution (although cash received will go towards Enterprise Value)
* Catalysts not forming (e.g. not introduced to russel 2000), S&amp;P doesn't recover etc.

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp)

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 19,045,000 BTC out there at a cost of 28,873.01.

That means, the market cap is 28,873.01 x 19,045,000 = 549,886,475,450 (549B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,739,028,516. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is .50 that means the market cap for Cardano is .5 X 33,739,028,516 =16,869,514,258 (16B)

You'll need a 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 30  
33,739,028,516 \* 30 = 1012170855480

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.23 Trillion. That’s only 0.11% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.   
Take Luna for example. You probably lost your investment. Period. But, you never know.   
Look at Ripple. Look at Shib.   
Both were thought to be dead, but they live. 

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

personalfinance,Discussion on Compound Interest,"Hi all,

I'm hoping we can all start a discussion over the reality of compound interest as it pertains to equities.

We're all aware of the basic compound interest example that's been burned into our brains by basically every financial media outlet.

""Here's Bob. Bob's a swell guy. Bob invests 10k when he was 20 at a 8% return for 35 years. Bob also contributed 5k a year. Bob is now a millionaire at 55""

I believe this cookie cutter example is disingenuous at best, and straight out misleading at worst. I'm not knocking the strategy or saying it's not sound, I'm just trying to show a better picture of the reality. First, this example over simplifies the math. Let's assume there was no yearly contribution on top of the initial 10k.

$10,000 earns 8% = $10,800

$10,800 earns 8% = $11,664

We see right away that this example doesn't perfectly correlate with how equities work. The above example assumes that ALL of my new account value is earning interest. Let's say I buy 1000 shares of a stock at $10. My total investment value is $10,000. Let's say a year later the stock is trading at $10.5/share. My new investment value is $10,500. Ok, great. All makes sense, however that full $10,500 is NOT compounding. You still have your initial 1000 shares. The only thing that is technically compounding is dividends that are reinvested.

Let's assume a .2c/share dividend, that gives you $20 dollars per year that buys more shares. The dividend is actually compounding and in line with the standard Bob example. Your initial $10,000 is not technically compounding, you are just banking on share appreciation. Now you can always look at the stock value in 5-10 years and then *back into* what the compounding rate *would have been* had your investment been actually compounding in the classical sense. I'm aware that good companies should technically be reinvesting their earnings to grow their business. This is how companies can exponentially grow which would in turn get you your compound interest rate. However that's a complex leap, there are many factors that can stunt this (scaling, competition, recessions, etc...).

Even the historical SPY averages are based on someone contributing a lump sum amount on 1 given day. Some quick algebra will generate a compounding rate *after* you know the final value of your investment.

We also have to assume that not everyone is Bob. Not everyone has the ability to throw a lump sum into the market. Most of us are dollar cost averaging out of our paychecks, putting minor amounts in every two weeks. This increases the complexity of the calculation, but as you can see we're already far removed from Bob. All the examples that are fed to you assume a lump sum investment, and that investment literally earning compound interest for the entire duration.

Every financial blogger in the world looks like a pro right now because of our historic bull market. To be clear, I am a huge advocate of index investing. I've been heavily contributing to SPY since I began my corporate career (10 years ago). I just think it'd be beneficial to paint a more realistic picture. Not everyone may be getting the 9% the market has promised. Of course, I could absolutely be incorrect in my thinking and would love someone to smash it to bits. I hope this can help everyone.

*St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard on Friday reiterated his view that the U.S. central bank ought to raise interest rates to 3.5% this year to get high inflation more quickly under control.*

*“The more we can frontload and the more we can get inflation and inflation expectations under control the better off we will be,” Bullard said in an interview with Fox Business Network. “And in the out years, ’23 and ’24, we could be lowering the policy rate because we’ve got inflation under control.”*

\---------------------------------------------------------

Thoughts on Bullard's latest statement?  Combined with his earlier statements this week that he feels the current schedule of 0.5 raises should be sufficient this year, I feel this is bullish overall.  At least this demonstrates that the fed is working to get back to rate cuts in the near future, and hopefully we aren't going to see interest rates balloon over many years like in the past.

Obviously the big question is whether inflation is going to get out of control, but IMHO it's only a matter of time before the war in Ukraine and the lockdowns in China end, both of which should help address supply issues and lower inflation.",finance,1653073437
personalfinance,[US] Do non-refundable federal tax credits still provide refunds up to the amount of federal taxes withheld?,"For example; say I have $9000 of federal taxes withheld from my paychecks, and this amount happens to be exactly what I needed to withhold in order to both owe nothing and get refunded nothing come tax season.

Then say I buy an EV that provides up to $7500 of a tax credit, which is a non-refundable credit.

All of the language I can find says that this credit applies to ""taxes owed"", but I am not finding language on if ""taxes owed"" includes ""taxes withheld""?

We'll gross between $240,000 and $260,000 this year.  We have about $150k saved, $100k earmarked for a down payment and closing costs, a $20k emergency fund and $30k worth of monthly student loan payments saved during the last couple years of forbearance which we intend to put against our loans once they come due. 

Only debt is $107k worth of student debt, less (in theory) the $30k we have saved against it. 

Two paid off cars a 2015 and a 2018.

Credit scores between 750 &amp; 800.

After taxes, health insurance and 15% into retirement we take home about $11,000 each month.  

We're considering houses between $600,000-$700,000.

In our area that means an older construction single family home around 1200-1400 square feet, two bed 2.5 baths and a small yard, townhouses provide a little more bang for the buck, up to 2400 square feet, 3 bed 4 baths maybe a two car garage and a deck out back.

Now that interest rates are around 5.5% and 5.7% the mortgage on a $700k house with \~$90k down is going to be somewhere around $4300.  

As rates have crept up and we've watched monthly payment estimates rise in response we've started feeling less comfortable.

stocks,Can the stock market recover without help from the Fed?,"Reposting because the original was removed. TLDR at the bottom. 

A lot of people seem to be confused as to what's going on, and asking why the market is crashing. It seems that the Bears have 2 core arguments, and it has to do mainly with the macro environment, and how valuations over the last 40 years have been stretched thanks to easy fiscal and monetary policy.

Here's what I've been hearing from the Bears (these are not my ideas, but I do think they are very strong arguments):

1. Over the last 40 years, we've had declining inflation, and declining interest rates to match. In addition, since 2009 we've had a near endless stream of QE. Now, because of Covid and the economy shut down, the money printing, the supply chain issues, war, food shortages leading to possible famine and global instability / political turmoil (Google Sri Lanka right now as an example, why is no one talking about that?). All this to say inflation is rearing it's ugly head again, and it's not nearly as transitory as everyone thinks because of the deglobalization that seems to be happening simultaneously. These issues will take months/years to resolve, and the Fed has no choice but to raise interest rates.
2. The Fed is now unwinding all the QE they've done over the last 13 years (since 2009), by doing Quantitative Tightening (QT), which is effectively the reverse. Remember when people said ""Don't fight the Fed"" on the way up? Well now the Fed is reversing, so the logic should remain the same (ie: Don't fight the Fed and bash your head against the wall buying every little dip). Every single V-shape recovery we've seen since the GFC is thanks to easy monetary policies, QE1, QE2, QE3, etc, or lowering of interest rates. They can't do this anymore, both because of inflation, and also because it's an unpopular policy in this inflationary environment.

So essentially, until the Fed reverses course or inflation comes down meaningfully over the next 12 months, you should sell rips or at least buy Puts to hedge yourself. The Inflationary Bear market in the 1970's was not a fun time to be an investor.

My thoughts when I first heard this point of view was, if there was no Fed intervention with the money printing and QE, and interest rates settled around 3.5-5%, where would the market be fairly valued? Is it a 15x P/E multiple, or a 10x multiple? Again, this assumes 0 Fed intervention via QE.

Would be interested in hearing everyone's thoughts on this.

Bitcoin,6 year old Andreas A. quote,"The really crazy, radical experiment in money, isn't Bitcoin..

In the last six years there has been an absolutely radical experiment in money, and that is, that in the first time in history, central banks took interest rates to zero.

And it wasn't just one of them, even though it was unprecedented, but 21 central banks have taken the interest rates to zero. Left it there for 6 years. And cannot raise it again, because if they raised it a tiny bit.. the entire economy would collapse.

This has never happened before.

It's the most radical monetary policy experiment since the introduction of central banking in the 1920's. We don't know how it will end But in most likelyhood it will not end well..

stocks,For the first time in a century! Dow in eight straight weekly losses as recession fears rise,"Recession worries rise.

Recession worries rise, once the S&amp;P 500 index into the bear market, but the main stock index late strong pull up, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 index erased weekday losses, the latter temporarily escaped the bear market range.

As of the close, the Dow rose slightly by 8.8 points to 31,261.9 points, after once sinking more than 600 points during the day; the S&amp;P 500 was almost flat at 3,901.4 points, the largest intraday pressure, the stock index fell 20.9% from its January intraday high, entering the bear market range for the first time in more than two years; the Nasdaq closed down 33.9 points or 0.3% at 11,354.6 points.

The last time U.S. stocks entered a ""bear"" was back in March 2020, when the epidemic hit Europe and the United States, and countries imposed blockades and suspended economic activities to control the spread of the virus. However, in that month, the Dow returned to the bull market in just 11 trading days, i.e., a rebound of more than 20% from the previous low.

Currently, U.S. stocks are suffering from multiple shocks, including high inflation, accelerating interest rates, rising recession risks and the uncertainty of the situation in Ukraine. Selling pressure has long spread from technology stocks to all sectors, year-to-date, energy stocks for the only sector to achieve gains.

This week, the latest earnings reports from major retailers have investors worried about weakening consumer purchasing power and the inability of companies to cope with inflation, which is at a 40-year high. Shares of retail giants Wal-Mart and Target fell sharply after disclosing their results, with both stocks posting their biggest one-day losses since Black Monday in 1987, with Wal-Mart down 19.5% for the week and Target down a cumulative 29.3%.

To sum up the week, the Dow accumulated a 2.9% decline, the eighth consecutive weekly closing decline, according to foreign media statistics, for the first time since 1923, i.e., a century; the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 3.1% and 3.8%, respectively, both hit the weekly seven consecutive negative, the longest decline since 2001.

National Securities chief market strategist Hogan (Art Hogan) said the past seven weeks of market struggles, largely related to inflation, ""what high inflation means for corporate profitability, the Fed will take more aggressive measures to fight inflation. While this issue is old hat, it will continue to be the number one headwind for the market.""

Bill Stone, chief investment officer at trust company Glenview Trust, wrote in a report that despite the many headwinds triggering the current sell-off, the immediate cause of the accelerating decline in stocks is investor concern about the consumer market. ""For the first time in the post-epidemic period, retailers are struggling with excess inventory, coupled with rising costs due to inflation, squeezing retailer earnings. There are signs that lower-end consumers are feeling the pinch from higher prices.""

Ross Stores, which missed revenue and earnings estimates, was another strong evidence of these concerns, with shares plunging 22.5% for the day. The company reported after-hours earnings Thursday for the year ended April, with revenue down 4 percent to $4.3 billion and net income down 29 percent to $340 million. The company's CEO, Barbara Rentler, said that the external environment is very challenging, the situation in Ukraine to exacerbate inflationary pressures, suffering from rising logistics and labor costs, revenue is expected to continue to weaken in the quarter ending July, sales will be backed by 4% to 6%.

John Deere, the largest U.S. farm machinery maker and considered a global economic bellwether, closed down 14.1%. For the quarter ended May 1, the company reported earnings of $6.81 per share, better than market expectations of $6.71, up 20 percent from a year earlier, on revenue of $12.03 billion, less than the expected value of $13.2 billion. The company said that despite higher costs for seeds and fertilizers, crop prices continued to be high, boosting farmers' interest in buying tractors, harvesters and other equipment. Therefore, the company raised its full-year earnings guidance, with a full-year net profit range of $7 to $7.4 billion. However, the company's management also noted that supply chain issues were disrupting production and delivery, and was confident that the situation would improve in the second half of the year.",finance,1653097149

1.Cash: this would deplete savings from 16K to 6K if I paid for it fully out of pocket but I have a steady income of ~4K/month post tax. 

2.Use my $3.5K in my HSA. I’m pretty young (27) and would love to see this money grow tax free over the next few years even though my portfolio is currently red. I can also fund any reimbursement of this procedure through my HSA later if necessary and as my job funds it with every paycheck

3.Get a 0% interest loan from a financer called CareCredit. This will split up the payment anywhere from 6-24 months interest free BUT if I miss a payment then interest rates are like 30%. 

4.Get a new credit card with 0% down bonus offer and use that for a couple months while I pay it off. I haven’t fully looked into this yet but I’m sure there’s some cards out there with good offers rn.

Long story short, my (M 28) long term girlfriend and I (of 3.5 years) have decided to part ways and I’m left with a relatively empty house. For context, I bought this house in March of 2021 for $267k while interest rates were still pretty low (2.75%). Mortgage is ~$1,400/month. Today, experts (Zillow) value the house around $350k. Several comparable houses in the neighborhood have sold recently around that price point, so seems like an ok guesstimate for now.

Don’t have a ton in savings right now (~$30k in 401 K, ~$5k emergency fund) as most of my savings were dumped into the house last year. 

My question; would it make more sense to keep the house and rent it out? Or sell it and put that money towards a new place and/or invest it?

economy,"Rant on how ""money printing"" actually works","# Intro

Recently I have seen a lot of posts on this sub as well as others that misunderstand the concept of money creation. Especially in the context of high inflation the idea of “printing money” as the source of our problems is being thrown around a lot. So I mainly want to explain how money is created in the real world. This is **not a theory** but rather a **simple description of reality**.

For those interested in the topic I recommend [This Article](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654) by the Bank of England. It also is the main source for this post. For even deeper insights into monetary theory I would recommend [This Lecture Series](https://sites.bu.edu/perry/mb-lectures/) by Perry G Mehrling of Boston University.

Feel free to correct me as I am just an annoyed econ student.

## How money is created

The idea of central banks printing money is pretty much just wrong. In reality money is mainly created by **banks making loans**. This does not involve the central bank at all. Their balance sheet increases (loans as bank’s assets; deposits as bank’s liabilities) and new money is created right there. You can spend what you borrowed while still owing the amount. **That’s it.**

So banks do NOT loan the money you deposit. They loan NEW money. You can see this process visualized in the image below (taken from the Bank of England Article mentioned above). When you pay back a loan the money is destroyed (taken off the balance sheet).

[From \\""Money creation in the modern economy\\"" by the Bank of England](https://preview.redd.it/01pchfki6t091.png?width=352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f356d178ff650937bf6ff1ea9bd9350d34601f5)

Also the “reserve ratio”, which is the minimal amount a bank has to hold in reserves is pretty much irrelevant. This ration is meant as an average over a few months or so. It does not have a major impact of the amount of loans being made on a daily basis.

## Limits of money creation

The central bank sets the rates at which banks can borrow money. The banks need to make a profit, so they charge higher interest to their customers (like households and businesses). How much interest the customers are willing to pay depends on how effectively they can spend the money. During economic booms, people expect to be able to make great returns on their borrowed money by investing it (in new machines and such) so they are willing to pay a higher interest rate.

Demand for money goes up → More loans are made → The amount of money increases

Now the central bank can raise interest rates to limit the amount of loans that are profitable for the banks. This will decrease the amount of money since less borrowing happens.

## Quantitative Easing [QE]

QE is a relatively new phenomenon in monetary policy used when the central bank has lowered the interest rate to their effective lower bound. Especially they can’t go lower than 0% interest (in nominal terms) because people will simply not give them money at negative interest rates but just hold it in cash. Therefore the central banks have to get creative when they want to stimulate the economy in a zero interest environment.

They do this by basically just giving money to companies. The central bank buys assets (using banks as financial intermediaries because companies don’t have accounts with central banks) from companies, again to stimulate investments and therefore increase economic output.

Edit as requested by u/Resident_Magician109 : QE is closer to ""money printing"" since the central bank actually increases the size of its balance sheet. 

## TL:DR

* The central bank doesn’t print money
* Commercial banks create money by lending money
* The central bank rate determines how profitable loans are, thereby limiting money creation",finance,1653130277
personalfinance,Lifestyle creep? Deciding to move or not.,"First time poster, longer time lurker.

&amp;#x200B;

Having a hard time deciding on whether to move to Arizona this summer or stay in the North East.

Some background:

* M(31), married, 2 kids (under 6).
* Single Income: $92k after-taxes (stable job, fully remote).
* Expenses: \~ $40k annual
* Savings: Always max 401k and both wife and my IRAs. Excess cash invest in Index funds.
* NW: $650k ($376k stocks, $260k house paid of $350k, $14k Cash Emergency Fun.

We've been saving since 2015 (I didn't understand money until a friend started telling me about FIRE). We've been saving with the main goal of making sure we are financially stable and to hopefully, be financially independent by early 40s ($1.5M and up). But just over a year ago, we decided to throttle back on saving and enjoy this time while the kids are little with a bit more focus. I left a $160k high-stress role and instead now work fully remote and actually have work life balance for the first time - I get to drop my kids off at school, and go to after school programs, etc. My peers make a lot more than me now, but I've been able to get over it by living more in alignment with my values (family time) and low cost of living not stressing me out.

Arizona has been in the back of our minds for the past few years and we want to give it a shot, but my main concern with moving is the recent spike in costs in Arizona and whether it tracks with our overall goals for being financially independent and secure.

Neither my wife or I come from money and we don't have a safety net, other than our own savings, to ask for financial help if we were to ever need it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Arizona tempts us because we can envision ourselves with more outdoor time as a family, enjoying the sun (insert oven jokes here).. The winters in the north east are starting to wear on us - thankfully it's gorgeous out again this time of year.

The homes we're looking at in AZ are \~$500k (doubled over the pandemic). PT and HOA: $3-4k -- but we plan to rent for the first year: $2,500/m, this is essentially $14k more annually than our current housing cost (am I thinking about this incorrectly?) Alternatively, we could do a short-term 1 month rental trial, to test it out in July-August. Our daughter would be able to attend school and we could see how it feels, but we just came back from an 8 day visit and don't necessarily want to sink $8k for another test run.

We bought our home for $350k. Now with the hot market, it's increased to \~$400k conservatively. PT and HOA: $9k

Looking for different personal or financial perspectives to approaching this decision. We bought our current house because of how cheap it is for the area. The monthly cost was less than our rent at $1,300/ month (large down payment and low interest rate, 3.25% vs now would be 5% plus). If we put our current home equity into the AZ home, the monthly cost would be \~$1,750. But the over-paid house makes me uncomfortable.

I have read a bunch of articles and threads about this topic, but can't really find an exact answer to my specific question. Maybe I am not getting it, but here is my question.

For the sake of simplicity, lets assume that 1B polkadot exists right now and is current circulating supply at t= 1 and 50% of the tokens are being staked, so 500M polkadot are being staked. Based on the whitepaper, this would bring inflation at exactly 10%. 

1) Does this mean that 100M polkadots will be minted next year? 10% of 1B is 100M? or 10% of the amount being staked, so 50M? (I think it's 100M, but want to check)

2) Since 500M people are staking, will they share that 100M meaning their return is 20%? (I.E someone staking 10K polkadot for an entire year in this specific example will have 12K polkadot at t=2 or next year)

3) In this specific example, inflation is 10% but staked return is 20%? Correct?",cryptocurrency,1653140940

algorand,"Analyzing AlgoDAO: Breaking down how the project is designed to be a money printer for the whales, and a conveyor belt to dump on the little guy.","Hello Algofam, this is a follow up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/ujzfne/its_time_to_raise_the_red_flag_on_algodao/) in which I called out a lot of the, suspicious, practices of AlgoDAO.

The concerns I brought up in that post were merely symptoms of the broader problem with the project. After that post, there was a lot of talk between the community and the team for how to amend these divisions, and I commend them for engaging. But for the most part, nothing is changing, and the team continues to move forward with their original plans.

The team did announce a vote about the unstaking fee, but the choice is to keep it as is or lower it over time. Conveniently left out is the option to remove it completely, something that clearly the majority of the community wanted. Showing that this is just an illusion of choice, but I digress.

What I want to follow up on isn't really about that. I wanted to do a deep dive and explain the mechanics of this project and how it is designed to excessively reward the whales and minimally reward the average investor, and how I believe the average investor and broader Algorand community are getting screwed here. 

To understand how this is you must first understand the structure of the project.

To keep it simple, the ""DAO"" is divided into 2 tiers. The ""Vanguard"", the institutional investors and the ""Federation"", the retail investors. There's also the ""High Council"" which is made up of the wealthiest retail investors, and the Federation is broken into multiple staking tiers as well, but none of that is relevant for now.

There's really two ways the retail investor is getting the short end of the stick here. The first is in regards to the distribution of the project's native tokens, and the second is in regards to all future IDO's coming from the launchpad. Let's first examine the distribution of AlgoDAO's native tokens, ADAO and SIGMA. 

I mentioned in the last post how there's three broad categories of token allocations for ADAO. 38% to team, advisors, and VC backers, 1% to retail and 61% to long term distribution via various programs. 

This means immediately right off the bat 38% of the supply is owned by the whales and just 1% is allocated to the rest of the Algorand ecosystem. This is obviously very asymmetric. But I think it's important to analyze how the remaining 61% will be allocated over the lifetime of the project. 

These various programs are allocated to the ""community"", the problem is that the team defines the ""community"" as all ADAO holders, including the team, advisors, and VC backers. The team confirmed that the distribution of these 61% of ADAO tokens will roughly be reflective of the composition of the ADAO holders, the ""community"" in their words. Even if we base this distribution upon the initial unlock of tokens (the 1% of the 4.71% initial unlock means the community controls approximately 21% of the initial circulating supply), this means that the 61% will be roughly divided between 21% to the retail holders and 79% to the team, advisors, and VCs. If we do some math, this means that we can estimate the final circulating supply to be roughly 86% controlled by the team, advisors, and VC's, while the average retail investors will control just 14% of the supply. 

Now, this is a rough estimate. It could be more, it could be less, it assumes everyone holds their tokens, but it doesn't take into account the vesting for the whales which would actually increase their allocation over time. This is the problem here, it shows how this project is designed to give very few whales a significant share of the ADAO tokens. And as you can see, the community's share of ownership actually decreases from 21% to 14% over time, meaning the project becomes MORE centralized over time, not less. And in any case a maximum estimated retail ownership of 21% does not come close to truly qualifying as a DAO. 

And of course, their other token, SIGMA, is allocated in proportion of ADAO holders as well, meaning roughly 86% of all SIGMA will end up in the hands of the whales while just 14% ends up in the hands of the average retail investors. 

So that's the first way the Algorand community is being squeezed and effectively lied to here. This is not a DAO, there's nothing decentralized about this process here. 

So that's just the platform's native tokens. But what about the IDO's on their launchpad? Well, this is a very similar situation. The Vanguard (read: whales) get to buy up the largest share of tokens at very cheap prices before proceeding to IDO. We see with the first IDO coming to AlgoDAO, Brightside, that the VC's get 18% of the project tokens while once again, the retail allocation for IDO is a paltry 0.5%. Do you see the pattern here?

The whales accumulate a massive amount of tokens at very cheap prices, then a very small amount is released to retail investors at a higher price, this then tees up the whales to have made a very large and very easy profit. Rinse and repeat over, and over, and over.

So in all the whales are getting the vast majority of ADAO, SIGMA, and IDO tokens at very cheap prices while the vast majority of the Algorand community is forced to fight over scraps. 

I do not believe this is a project that has the best interests of the average Algorand community member in mind. The entire project is engineered to excessively reward the few whales while giving the average guys and gals the appearance of being involved and getting a good deal, but it's just that, a façade. 

When we think of Algorand, Web3, and Decentralized Finance, we think of inclusive systems that break down barriers to give the average person access to what was previously locked away from them. This project is absolutely no different than traditional finance. It is still the few whales getting all the benefits then shoveling to the average retail investor to buy their bags. 

And I want to repeat again that I really liked this project, and to a degree I still do, but I have had a lot of time to think about it and I just don't believe its current structure is something that we should applaud, in fact I think we need to stand up and call this out. This is to a large extent the exact opposite of what crypto represents. And I just want to share all of my thoughts here with the Algorand community who might also be interested in researching this project. 

As always, happy to hear what people have to say in the comments.

Edit: I also want to say that my intention with these posts isn’t to FUD the project, or to attempt to steer people away from it. Although I recognize that is a reasonable position to take, even one that I’ve taken myself as I initially planned a large investment into the project but decided to hold back for now.

My intention is merely to bring these issues to the forefront as these are often details that can get buried in the fine print of a project. I want to see this project improve, and to make the ecosystem better as a whole. My time in this project and looking through what they’ve accomplished has shown me that many people on the team are very passionate and talented people. It’s just that there are some significant problems with the project on a fundamental level. I’m not one to say if these were intentional or not, or if the team was unanimous or not in the implementation. 

So just wanted to say this as I know these posts can have a resounding negative tone to them. The concept is solid, but the implementation is highly questionable.",cryptocurrency,1653153097

Average rates are 5.5% (based on google) and our docs said 5.5% so I assumed we weren’t purchasing points and agreed. A buddy of mine who is in lending looked over our docs. He said with your credit, etc, there should be no reason you’re not getting 5.5% without points. I told him I didn’t think we were purchasing points. The lender never told us we were. My buddy showed me the ‘fine print’ of where they were in the costs. I gave the lender an ear full and and he immediately took all points off with a 5.7% interest rate.

My question is - did I get bait and switched? Or is it typical to always pay points and it’s ‘assumed’ that everyone pays points in this process? I told the lender I don’t care what’s common, you should have told me that on day 1.

Bitcoin,Some Proposals By Saylor &amp; Saifedean are Worrying,"We need to talk about the future of smart contracts and apps, dapps so forth with Bitcoin.

This is not 2017, technology is rapidly changing. The ability to do things with agnostic zk rollups and layer 3 solutions is going to allow a lot of things to be done with lightning channels. The most advanced on the cusp things are by far using lightning and final settlements via bitcoin

This would allow bitcoin to be used as a global encryption utility to give finality to say the existence of a social media account, someones speech, someone's writing, political opinions, their art and expression and so forth. Mind you, this is not easy or here yet with bitcoin, this is the most advanced stuff firmly in the realm of Clairo, Clarity, Rust programming, Zk Rollups and so forth. To do this with only bitcoin is not simple or easy. Historically everything was focused around making a new \[redacted\] and being robbed by Venture capital. No ecosystem interchangiability, no fungibility, no composability, just endless scams.

That gets us to Saylor and Saifedean and their political positions, and US Financial Laws.

How are you going to protect the speech, expression, writing, and social media of 168 countries, and 8 billion people \*from their own government\* much less our government the absolute imperialist monetary  colonialism financial regulations of US Law.

There is only one way to do that, and it is highly composable client side software that

1) uses Bitcoin to settle and prove finality, to pay for global omniprescent storage. If someone's writing and posts exist on one server or one computer, some nation state will censor or seize it.

2) Is fully anonymous to prevent state persecution

3) Uses bitcoin to prevent duplication, fraud, plagiarism, and impersonation, the finality of identity, similar to a public PGP signature.

While what I mentioned may sound totally sane and intuitive, the fully anonymous part is what G20 states, Fatf, and US Law and EU Law are hyper hostile towards and are fighting tooth and nail. I cannot begin to explain to you how hard they are working behind the scenes to prevent this, to censor the entire internet, with the EU now proposing a law to do CLIENT SIDE scanning of all posts and speech. Truly an Orwellian totalitarian state.

So this brings me to this point. 

If Saylor and Saifedean are aiding and abetting the SEC out of political spite, and cooperating with US Financial Surveillance laws and ultimately promoting and defending EU and US and even other G20 States,

**\******How are you going to protect the speech and expression of 8 billion people,*** **if these so called bitcoin thought heros promote KYC compliance on every single company or development team, how can you create an ecosystem culture that defends the human race from state political persecution if you enable a culture of defending the SEC, CFTC, FSOC, DOJ, DHS, and other US and EU financial regulators?\***",cryptocurrency,1653157118

It seems like a huuuge jump in monthly expenses and really doesn't seem like it would allow for much wiggle room. If we want to put down 20% that would require me to essentially liquidate all of my stock/savings to afford the home in the first place.

personalfinance,Can I quit and should we sell?,"My husband and I both work full time. We have a two and a half year old and I’m due with our second child in July. Our joint gross income is $180k. He makes $105k and I make $70k. I’m questioning if I’ll be able to stay home with the kids and stop working. Excuse me for just not being good at anything financial, besides being pretty frugal.

We have no debt besides our house. We drive humble cars that are both paid off. So it’s our mortgage and childcare that are the biggest monthly expenses (childcare will be about $2400 per month for 2 kids). We purchased a new home 6 months ago for $589k. We sold our home for $400k that we bought 5 years before for $280k. We took that money and paid cash for a condo that we rent out now. We live in an awesome neighborhood that I love, but I feel like it’s just too much (monthly mortgage is $3200). It has 5 bedrooms and I just feel like a slave to the house now. As in…. I am working and not home with the kids because I work to pay for this house. Idk. We could probably turn around and sell it now for $700k because of this market and our prime location.

I know it’s crazy to sell this quickly, but it’s almost like my priorities changed completely. Bad timing after we just moved, I know. The issue is we probably would not be able to get anything for less than $400k/$420k in this market and interest rates are twice what they were when we bought 6 months ago. I went to an open house today for a cute 3 bedroom home listed at $389k. Less nice neighborhood for sure, but much better schools.

Final issue is that my husband and I used to be very conservative together financially. But with this massive house and two kids that are expensive, I feel so constricted and want to be with them instead of working to be in this house I enjoy two days a week since I work. I regret the house. Truthfully, I did say I wanted more space but I have changed my mind and seriously changed my priorities. Now he says he has lifestyle inflation and can’t go back. So it’s like we’ve both changed in wildly different ways and idk how to return to an adjusted approach to our current situation with two kids.

I then contributed $5000 into my Vanguard settlement fund.

I hoped that when I moved from M1 to Vanguard, all the money from M1 could go straight into Vanguard's Money Market settlement fund, but for some reason, Vanguard created two ETFs for me and moved the transferred money into them. But, anyway... here is the current distribution:

**CONNS INC (NASDAQ: CONN)**

Conn’s Inc. is a publicly traded American furniture, mattress, electronics and appliance store chain headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, United States.

Conn’s is a specialty retailer currently operating 150+ retail locations in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

As of 5/20/2022 the business has a market capitalization of $286,390,000 with 23.7 million shares outstanding at a price of $12.04 per share.

Based on the balance sheet figures from March 2022, the business had a book value of $614,819,000. The business has no goodwill or intangible assets, as such the book value is equal to the tangible book value. The business is selling on the market for $328 million less than its liquidation value. Book value per share was $25.84 as of 1/31/22, more than double the current market price. Of important note, the business has successfully managed to increase its shareholders equity consistently with the exception of the period 2/1/2020-1/31/2021, due to COVID and mandatory lockdowns.

Conn’s Inc has a price to book ratio of .47. Generally, a business selling below its book value is a distressed business which has been losing money. However, if we look at Conn’s performance over the years, we see a business which has been able to consistently post profits.

With the exception of the period ending 1/31/2021. Conn’s has posted consistent profits. The average profit over the past 5 years (including the loss year) is $48.27 million. Adjusted to exclude the loss year, average profit for the past 5 years is $61 million. One important note, the large increase in earnings for 2022 is not related to sales growth as the sales levels are comparable to 2018 and 2019. The jump in net income appears to be primarily related to their provision for bad debts. The business adjusted how it records bad debt in the most recent year, significantly reducing the balance and as a result increasing income.

What is really interesting about Conn’s is their cash flow information. 2021 saw free cash inflows in excess of the current market cap! FCF was $406 million in 2021. The average FCF over the past 5 years is $142,568,400

Additionally, the business repurchased $121.6 million in shares between 2020 and 2022. Note: no shares were repurchased in 2021. Furthermore, in December 2021 the [board authorized a $150 million dollar share repurchase plan](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/15/2352402/0/en/Conn-s-Announces-Authorization-of-150-Million-Share-Repurchase-Program.html#:~:text=Conn's%20Announces%20Authorization%20of%20%24150%20Million%20Share%20Repurchase%20Program,Conn's%2C%20Inc.), with the authorization expiring December 14th 2022. As of March 2022, Conn had repurchased 5.9 million shares at an average price 21.41 per share which equates to approximately 20% of the company’s outstanding shares as of the prior reporting date in October 31 2021.

You may be wondering, how can a business with a tangible book value of $600 million, consistent profits, hundreds of millions in free cash flows and share buybacks of $150 million be valued at a mere $268 million?

If we take a look at the share statistics, one explanation is to look at how shorted the stock is. 25% of shares are shorted and 66% of the float is shorted. The large amount of short positions are partly responsible for dragging the share price down. This makes the stock one of the most shorted stocks on the market today. Insider confidence appears strong however, 33% of shares are held by insiders. Attempting to ascertain the reasons behind the massive short position on this stock is difficult. However, we can make some assumptions.

Assumption 1: retail as a whole is being beaten down by the market. Likely due to continued increases in cost, as well as increased financing costs due to increasing interest rates.

Assumption 2, there exist the possibility that the valuations performed by institutions are inadequate for Conn’s operations. Per the most recent 10-k, 51% of purchases were financed through Conn’s in-house credit program. As such, much of the cash in the business is used up to buy inventory which is then lent out. In this respect, Conn acts more like a bank than a regular retailer because all of their liquidity is being used up to provide financing for their customers. Hence their balance sheet looks more similar to a banks balance sheet than a specialty retailers balance sheet. This results in low cash on hand, particularly in relation to debt held by the business.

Using the most recent balance sheet figures in a valuation. Calculating equity value using the conventional approach of adding cash and subtracting debt leads to an equity valuation below book value due to the businesses unique structure. Regardless of the Enterprise Value calculated by discounted cash flows, the equity value will be $514.4 million lower due to the respective cash and debt balances.

If assumption 1 and 2 are true, this could create a negative feedback loop resulting in a lower EV/EBITDA ratio, which if used by a large number of marginal investors in the market, would lead to valuations being further off. The current EV/EBITDA multiple for Conn’s in 1.3x. If any large institution uses a pure exit multiple as a part of their valuation, they are likely to be significantly off in their valuation.

**CONCLUSION:**

Based on the earnings of $48-$61 million on average for the past 5 years and average cash flows of $142 million over the past five years or $71 million if we exclude 2021. The business should be selling at no lower than its book value. Based on the current number of shares outstanding the price per share should be no less than $25.85.",finance,1653196950

Right now, I have no exposure in the financial sector, something I'd like to chance. I also have no clue on how to evaluate a bank's fundamentals and balance sheet and spotting things like risk and time bombs.

# Intro

Hey everyone! [So some background](https://reddit.com/u/schemeelectronic9058) \- I make indexes/strategies that sound really fucking WallStreetBets-y but have a little bit of sound analysis behind them. I'm the guy who built the [Inverse Cramer ETF](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/), as well as the [South Park investing strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/uq1tbr/oc_an_investing_strategy_that_tracks_south_park/i8sjoq4/?context=3). Tl;dr - these meme strategies *seem* to work (I'm working on turning these into real ETFs, because they've gotten considerable attention)

What I wanted to see next, based on some WallStreetBets comments, was whether I could find either an equity or an options strategy based on the JPow's speeches that seemed to have worked historically. Here's what I did:

# The Data

I took all the data I could find on Powell's speech dates [from C-Span](https://www.c-span.org/search/?sdate=&amp;edate=&amp;congressSelect=&amp;yearSelect=&amp;searchtype=Videos&amp;sort=Most+Recent+Airing&amp;text=0&amp;personid%5B%5D=17815). Ended up being quite a few hundred videos. I wasn't looking for any bullish/bearish content from the speech. The signal I was looking to test for with this strategy was - can we glean any market information from the time of JPow's speeches, and/or do market participants act differently shortly after his speech?

# The Strategy

Fuck JPow right? So anyways, I tracked the S&amp;P with 100% of the portfolio. Whenever JPow spoke, I reallocated 15% of the portfolio into daily puts (at the specific time of the speech). Used the same purchase price as strike price, so I benefit from a directional bet rather than a magnitude one.

I also did this with strategy with calls for fun. First time I've done an options strategy, so any feedback here is welcome!

## Execution

In execution, it looked like this:

* Took all the dates that JPow was speaking
* Used the adjusted close/open to factor in dividends and splits
* If you've followed along [my posts before](http://reddit.com/u/SchemeElectronic9058), I always start off with a naive algorithm as a sanity check. If I'm able to get some sort of signal without doing much work on structuring the data, that makes me happy because there might be some kind of strong signal that you don't have to do statistical magic for
   * The naive algorithms used equities. What if we bought the SPY the day of JPow's speech, then sold either at end of day, or at open the next day
   * This time, the naive algorithm failed. Becaue you're mostly out of the S&amp;P, you don't get all the upside of the last 4 years. **In hindsight, the naive algorithm (and using equities) was pretty fucking stupid.** You'd have to have the thesis that the S&amp;P has the biggest jumps only on days JPow speaks, and is otherwise flat or in a bear market

Anyways, then I tried a daily options strategy. When JPow's speech is released on C-Span, I bought an option the next hour, and exercised by the end of day.

Again, the naive ones didn't do BAD - they just weren't exciting, and were really what you'd expect. Staying in cash most of the time and not making any big bets on direction means you're going to stay relatively flat (therefore beat probably 95% of WSB)

## PUT Portfolio

This was the strategy that reallocated 15% into puts right at the start of JPow's speech (or start of the next trading day), and exercised/let expire at the end of the closest trading day.

## CALL Portfolio

This portfolio did worse than the PUT portfolio when you look at the end of our trading period vs the start, but it did have some really, really good moments in 2020.

# Conclusion

So, yeah - JPow doesn't fucking have predictive power. Was a pretty stupid idea in hindsight. What we did learn here is that JPow's speech dates are very much a confounding factor - he speaks during times of crisis, meaning following them is a play on trading volatility.

The best strategy based on the results here seems to be buying puts on a daily basis when there are inklings of panic and volatility, and then buying calls when you're sure people are panicked, scared, and volatile. You'll lose your bet most days, but when you're right, you're right big. Thoughts? Any other conclusions to be made?",finance,1653205380

stocks,Shopify company analysis and valuation - 80% down and still expensive? ($SHOP),"Shopify had a crazy stock-price movement in the last 2 years, went from roughly $350 prior to the pandemic, to almost $1,800 (almost 5x) at its peak, and is now down to $364 (80% down).

The goal of this post is to share my fundamental analysis and valuation of this highly volatile company. Feel free to provide your feedback and disagree with me :)

At the peak, the market cap was over $220b, let's keep that number in mind. Today, it's around $46b. Let's get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Shopify?**

In one sentence, it is an eCommerce website builder that takes care of the infrastructure and provides additional services/solutions (payment processing, marketing, analytics, inventory &amp; fulfillment, etc.). It allows setting up and operating a business online easier.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Shopify make money?**

The revenue is split into two groups:

1. Subscription revenue - This is self-explanatory, and refers to the monthly recurring revenue that Shopify gets from the individuals/businesses that use their platform. This stream of revenue doesn't depend on the success of the users. Regardless if a company sells 1 product or a million, the subscription revenue is fixed. In my view, this is the less-risky stream as they'd only lose customers if they switch to another platform (not that likely) or a business goes bankrupt. Historically, this stream grew 50% year-over-year, now almost $1.4b for the last twelve months (ending Q1/2022). This is also a high-margin business, with a gross margin of 80%.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Merchant solutions - This is the segment that takes all of the other revenue and is highly dependent on the success of the individuals and businesses that use the platform. Payment processing fees, currency conversion, referrals, advertising, etc, all of that is included here. If there's a slowdown in the economy and the eCommerce business decreases, this stream of Shopify would be harmed. In the last years, it grew roughly 75% year-over-year to almost $3.5b in the last twelve months. The gross margin in this segment is lower (43%).

&amp;#x200B;

The overall gross margin has been decreasing and if we only look at that in isolation, the conclusion would be that something bad is going on and Shopify cannot keep its margins at the same level. This is not correct. The reason for the margin decline is only due to the fact that the lower-margin revenue stream (Merchant solutions) is growing faster than the higher-margin revenue stream (Subscription-based). Hence, the gross margin naturally moves closer to the stream that contributes more.

So, the total revenue is close to $5b. If we put this next to the market cap at its peak of $220b, it seems quite unreasonable for anyone to pay such a huge premium. Yes, the company has been growing at high rates, but the growth cannot continue at that pace forever. The moment the growth declines, that's where the problems start and a correction comes in, so it's always wise to incorporate this growth decline in the model and not assume growth of 50-60% for a very long period of time.

The overall gross margin is at 53% for the last 12 months and it is expected to drop even further. Let's keep it simple and assume that it will decrease to 50%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Operating expenses**

With the remaining 50%, Shopify needs to cover 3 main expenses to get to the operating result.

1. Sales &amp; marketing - Decreased from 34% of revenue (2017) to 21% in LTM.

2. R&amp;D - Remains stable at around 20% of revenue in the last 5 years

3. G&amp;A - Remains stable at around 10% of revenue in the last 5 years

&amp;#x200B;

By subtracting these 3 costs, we get to an operating profit of 1%. So, a company with revenue below $5b and no operating profit, was selling for $220b. That sound quite irrational. Of course, there are a couple of other factors to consider.

Every growth company puts as much effort as possible into growing quickly. For Shopify, that's mainly in Sales &amp; Marketing and R&amp;D. The more potential customers they can reach, the faster they can grow. The more they can innovate, the more services they can provide. However, as the growth slows down, these costs as % of revenue decrease. The marketing won't yield the same returns as before, simply because the # of potential customers decreases. All of this will lead to margin expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Balance sheet**

There are a couple of main points to mention:

1. Shopify is a capital-light business that doesn't need to invest in tangible assets in significant amounts.

2. They have a strong cash position ($7.2b in cash &amp; short term investments + $2.9b in long-term investments)

3. The debt is at a very low level, roughly $1.2b (insignificant compared to their $10b cash/investments). It could be argued that they didn't use the low-interest rates to increase their financial leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, Shopify announced the acquisition of Deliverr for $2.1b, a company that will add value in their process of inventory inbounding and distribution. The aim is to offer delivery to the customer within 2 days of ordering (Competitive with Amazon Prime). This is not yet paid, so needs to be deducted when valuing Shopify as a company)

&amp;#x200B;

**DCF model**

Key assumptions:

1. Revenue growth: 25% for the next 5 years, then slowly decrease to the risk-free rate of almost 3%.

2. Operating profit: Slowly improve to 25% (Basically, the 3 types of expenses mentioned above, combined, should decrease to 25% of revenue over the next 10 years)

3. Discount rate - 11.7% (Based on WACC)

Outcome: **Value per share - $276/share (current market price - $364)**

My assumptions are based on what I think Shopify can deliver with high probability. Could be I be wrong? Absolutely!

&amp;#x200B;

**What if I'm wrong?**

Based on my assumptions, the revenue will grow by 426% in 10 years and the operating margin is estimated at 25%. However, I could be significantly wrong. Therefore, the table below provides a valuation of the company based on assumptions different than mine related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin.

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|300% ($19.0b)|$190.1|$229.3|$269.1|
|426% ($24.4b)|$226.8|$275.8|$326.4|
|1000% ($51.0b)|$400.3|$500.5|$601.0|
|3350% (159.9b)|$1,089.9|$1,388.4|$1,687.0|

Based on your assumptions about the revenue growth and margin expansion of Shopify, you can decide whether the company is expensive or not at this price.

The last row is only for illustration of how irrational the market was in the last year when the price went up to almost $1800. Basically, to justify that valuation, the company would need to grow the revenue by around 50% every year for the next decade and at the same time improve its operating margin to 30%. So, starting with the gross profit being around 50%, the Sales &amp; Marketing, R&amp;D, and G&amp;A together, should be 20% of sales.

stocks,Why I’m still bullish on $SOFI,"Yes - the macro is terrible. Yes - student loan payments being suspended means their revenues face headwinds. Yes - rising interest rates.

But - have you actually used their app? It is one of the cleanest UIs I’ve seen next to Robinhood (boooooooo). Once you get in to their app, the focus on cross-sell is nothing short of impressive.

Only wanted SoFi for their stocks? Too bad, you’re going to be incentivized with points to open a checking account. You thought that was it? Open credit card and get even more points. All points are redeemable for cash. They have one of the lowest cost of acquisitions in the industry and I can see why. The app is built absolutely beautifully.

I encourage you - give their app a shot. It just flat out works. I’m planning on refinancing a loan with them here soon. Because? Their stupid app and I get money back.

CryptoCurrency,iso20022 and the Five Cryptos that Comply,"I hadn't heard of iso20022 until this week, and it's probably something we should all keep on our radar as it pertains to crypto. Maybe you all know about it, but for the people that don't, here's an ELI5.

**What is iso20022?**

ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 20022 is a global standard for sending payment instructions between local, regional, and international financial institutions. Banks globally will migrate from legacy SWIFT MT financial messaging to the highly structured and data-rich ISO 20022 standard in the coming years. The framework provides an internationally agreed business message syntax and semantics. ISO 20022 will become the global standard for large-scale payment systems of reserve currencies, handling the vast majority of such transactions worldwide.

**What does it have to do with crypto?**

The U.S. government is helping expedite the adoption of ISO 20022, and the Federal Reserve Banks will adopt the standard in late 2023. I understand that some regulation might be good for mass adoption, but I am wary of how aggressive the government might get.

There are currently five cryptocurrencies compliant with iso20022; This means that, should the FSR decide to allow digital reserve currencies, these could be among the options considered. To be compliant, a crypto blockchain would have to fulfill all the SWIFT communication requirements, including the ability to pass customer data on the blockchain:

* **XRP/Ripple**
* **XDC**
* **Stellar Lumens**
* **Iota**
* **Algorand**

And these cryptos are rumored to be compliant but not confirmed:

**• Hedera Hashgraph**

**• Quant**

**• Cardano**

ISO defines standards for fiat currencies under ISO 4217. This 4217 standard has been used for global bank payments and stock markets since 1978, when it was first codified. The existing code definition method raises issues for crypto codification, because many crypto codes conflict with existing country codes.

The following chart shows some ways in which crypto codes could clash with current ISO 4217 currency identifiers:

I don't see ANY scenario where anyone should be doing this unless they put money in that they were going to need in less than 18 months or are thinking too short term. Clearly yeeted all their money on an overvalued market and kept nothing as an emergency fund if they can't last more than 4 months in a dropping market.

I get that some people will fall on hard times and will need to liquidize as they need cash in order to survive, there are always going to be those cases whether it's a bear market or not. But we're only 4 months in and people on here are first-hand admitting they're doing it because they are fed up of looking at red.

I would try to get more cash in any other possible way before I sell something in the red, even when it looks likely we're going down further from here. Because in 5-10 years, this fall will be a distant memory. I would get a second job, sell my things, reduce all luxury spending to zero...all before selling positions that are 30%+ down.

However, if one is putting money into blackrock ETFs, does the same logic hold?

2. Sell my rental and use the down-payment to avoid PMI on a Condo (likely somewhere around $300k less down payment). Which crushes my dream of someday being a snowbird with property in AZ and WA. UGH.

solar,"In the process of going solar in Pheonix, AZ (Sunrun)","The decision:

I always thought that solar panels are an incredible invention and it's amazing that you can produce electric energy on your own roof, but was hesitant to invest at first. There are some 'objects' around my house that I thought might obscure the direct sunlight, but found something called '[Google Project Sunroof'](https://sunroof.withgoogle.com). You enter your address and it shows the possible earnings based on a satellite image of your house. The savings it showed for me exceeded expectations and made me pull the trigger. (Obviously don't rely on this alone) After visiting multiple friends who went solar to see how everything functions and discussing the installation process, it was time I start to look for solar system providers. The first thing I did was searching online for some reliable installers in my area (Phoenix, Arizona). There are plenty of online resources to help you find a local installer, but after some digging [this website](https://solaroofa.co/bestcompany) helped me find some real life reviews and avoid certain companies. Generally, all solar installers provide an extensive 25 years warranty, but make sure to read anything before signing, as there might be some strings attached. After requesting and estimate from all the companies with good ratings, I got 5 quotes in total. I chose Sunrun due to a proven track record and best financing options (IMO). They got in touch shortly after providing quote and were glad to explain the process to a first timer.

Observation of my Roof:

My roof was not new, so I had to make sure that they would be able to install them. The solar professional visited and checked my 10-year-old shingle roof, which was starting to show signs of wear and tear, but he said that it wasn't a problem at all. The shingle roof is usually considered one of the best roofs for installing solar panels. I was also worried about the shade from some nearby trees, but he assured me that it wouldn't be an issue either. He said that they will align PV panels in such a way that they'll still get plenty of sunlight throughout most of the day after that I was much satisfied.

Cost estimates &amp; financing:

I had planned to install a 5 KW solar system for my energy needs along with a net-billing program so that excess power could be sold back to my utility company Arizona Public Service (APS). Under net-billing, excess solar energy is purchased by Utility at a rate that is 5% to 30% lower than the retail rate of electricity. My existing electricity bill was $300-$400 and I made up my mind to take it to ZERO. After several quotes, the solar panel cost I found in Phoenix, AZ was $2.44 -$3 per watt. A solar panel system size of 5 kilowatts (kW) was ranging from $10,370 to $14,030, with tier 1 Soleria Power XT model 400W panels (20% efficiency) and grid-tied SolarEdge HD Wave inverter.

After doing some research, I found out that there are several financing options available including Lease, loan, and cash payments. You can finance them through a bank loan or you could use cash-back offers from companies like SolarCity and Sunrun. In addition to saving money on your electricity bill, they'll also help you save money with valuable tax credits which are 26% in 2022. After accounting for the 26% [Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics) and other state and local solar incentives, my net price was reduced significantly.

The average payback period for my solar panels in Phoenix, AZ will take around 8 years and the average electricity savings from installing solar panels is around $44,000 over a 20-year period. I am satisfied that I’ll get a solid return on my investment, even though it will take a while.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Ok guys, I hear you, I will reach out to some local companies to see if they can do it cheaper. I'm definitely not advertising anything *fuck* sunrun if you don't like them.

personalfinance,When to repay student loans vs. invest in the market,"Hey all, I'm cross-posting my [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/uvdjyq/is_repaying_plan_2_student_loans_early_ever_worth/?) from /r/UKpersonalfinance - my student loan is in the UK, but I now reside in the US so you all may have different insights on investment options.

For my income bracket, UK Plan 2 student loans have their interest rates pegged at inflation + 3% (inflation measured by Retail Price Index). Over the past 10 years, market performance has absolutely smashed this rate, but obviously this isn't guaranteed (especially with looming potential economic downturn). Another benefit of Plan 2 loans is that you only repay 9% of your income above the threshold (currently 34,000 USD/yr), meaning that if I am ever out of work my repayments will stop until I am working again.

If I were to continue making the minimum payments, I would repay the loan in about 23 years. With the most aggressive repayments possible, I would repay the loan in about 7 years. My partner and I both max our IRAs and HSAs, contribute to our 401(k)s up the employer match, and have a total retirement savings rate of about 20% pre-tax. We do not own a home.

investing,Series i bond interest reporting,"So with the bonds earning a significant %, I’m looking into purchasing the allotment for this year. I was reading up on tax implications on the treasury website and it has two options on paying interest.     

You have a choice. You can
report the interest every year
put off (defer) reporting the interest until you file a federal income tax return for the year in which the first of these events occurs:      
you cash the bond and receive what the bond is worth, including the interest, or
you give up ownership of the bond and the bond is reissued, or.      
the bonds stops earning interest because it has reached final maturity.      

So my question is this: I thought that the treasury sends you a check for interest earned every so often.  Is that not the case?

Super Bowl had a bunch of commercials for dot com company’s right before the crash and everyone was making money left and right.  We have crypto.com as an arena now and a bunch of crypto advertisements for super bowl, sports players taking BTC for salary.  Clearly a euphoric time just like 20 years ago.  The dot com bubble took 15 years to recover! 

Clearly we’re heading towards a recession.  That means stock market will drop and unfortunately BTC seems to be pegged to the Nasdaq.  It took Nasdaq and amazon 15 years to reach ATH once bubble burst.  Clearly we were in a bubble with interest rates low, stimulus money, people bored at home becoming new investors and the Warren Buffet indicator being the highest it’s ever been!

personalfinance,I own acreage near a growing city and work remote. Should I sell or rent my house?,"Years ago I bought \~100 acres in a good are of the Rockies and built a house (mortgaged), where I live. It's off-grid (no water, sewer, electricity from city) but I have a massive solar array, indoor plumbing w/ great water, massive woodstove (and a forest to power it), Starlink, etc., so it mostly feels like an ordinary home. For snowy days in winter, I have a generator.

I had a job offer for a good remote job, and so I quit and took it. If this job fell through somehow, I'd likely do the same thing for another firm, so I am flexible about where to live.

Since I built the house, COVID and remote work happened. Similar types of land in the Rockies (large, just outside small cities with universities and airports) are hard to find. Also, the nearby city has a massive shortage of housing here for both renters and buyers.

I have a great view, my water is clean, it would be decent for raising kids. But since nothing's keeping me here, I'm essentially spoiling myself with a scarce resource (local housing). I could live in North Dakota, etc.

I've considered these options:

* **Sell the house.** It's been appraised for a lot more than my debt on it, mostly because of the land. The pro is that I could cash out and buy in a less desired place. A con is that I'll likely never own this much land or have this much privacy again. Also, it has been estimated that it may take a year or so to sell (it's a lot of land, big ships turn slowly). Newly raised interest rates pose a challenge; I know it's possible for me to do owner financing (the buyer's down payment would pay off the balance, then I'd get the payments with interest). With these options, I could easily pay off a house or land elsewhere.
* **Rent the house** by hiring a property management company, income going toward the mortgage. It would be a little while before I had 20% down for a good place again, so in the short term, I'd likely be renting too (albeit somewhere cheaper). There is a significant challenge here: Where an on-grid house has some risk/wear and tear to renting, an off-grid house has more risk. E.g., it would take some money to idiot-proof the electrical system to prevent someone from damaging the batteries by running everything possible in the middle of winter.
* Some kind of [**borrowing from 401k** magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUN4YdQgVQ) to pay off the debt and knock out the mortgage much faster. To my knowledge, cons abound: 401k may increase in value again (while I've borrowed from it), what if I change jobs, etc.
* Some kind of short term rental (**Airbnb**) setup. This type of rental would fit the property best, and may avoid some of the problems of a long-term renter. With the adjacent state land, it's like having a state park to yourself. The driveway (currently unplowed in winter) is a nice ski or snowshoe adventure. Cons are that I'd irregularly need other housing, and nearby (I don't know if property management companies run Airbnbs).
* **Keep living in the house.** It's a nice place, it will appreciate (more than the S&amp;P500? who knows). Also, my interest, property taxes, and insurance are far below the cost to rent here (but maybe not cheaper than renting elsewhere).
* **Hold the house**, but live elsewhere. While doable, this option makes the least sense financially unless I bought a second home and was getting equity in both.

I'm mid 30s, have a small IRA and \~$100k in a 401k (underinvested, my mistake). My mortgage debt is $160k. Monthly expenses are minimal (internet is the only significant one).

stocks,Can markets actually do well without the Fed support?,"I was looking at a long term chart of the US markets, and it seems that there are extremely long periods where stocks do basically nothing.

Just look at 1934 - 1950, or 1950-1982 as an example. Sure the market ran up big from 50-66, but from 66-82 it gave it all back. So anyone who started investing in 1950 would have almost no returns for 30 years! That's brutal.

It seems that it's only when Volcker killed inflation and we had a 40 year period of declining interest rates that US markets did well consistently. People's opinions on investing and valuations today is a result of 4 decades of low inflation and lowering interest rates. Now that we're seeing this come apart due to higher inflation and higher rates, I'm worried about what this means for investors, especially as the inflation is much stickier than people initially believed. 

So with that said, can the stock market do well without intervention from the Fed? What is fair value if there's no QE, and interest rates are at 3-5%?

Also, over the last 10 years, the most crowded trade has been index investing. Some people are saying now that the next 10 years will favour active management, and this crowded trade (indexing) will be a painful unwind.

Thoughts on this?",finance,1653251859
stocks,Stocks will fall til QT and hikening cycle stops any reasoning why not?,"If you look at the past QE / QT cycle they are timed almost perfectly with bull and bear markets.

You could argue a certain pricing in and that it happens before but right now we are just starting and inflation is stil extremly high. If stocks would bottom out and go up/rally that would just give the FED more than enough time and room for being even more hawkish and continue it's hikening and tightening cycle til whenever until stocks seriously collapse even more.

Stocks continue to dump -&gt; Inflation may normalise and FED will again step in to stop a collapse

Stocks bottom out here and we go sideways/up -&gt; FED has no urgency to step in and they will continue everything until whenever which will ultimately lead to a dump again since they won't need to stop if everything is going great

personalfinance,Mortgage Question (Refinance or HELOC),"Hello all,
I am in a bit of a peculiar situation. Long story short, I bought land and my dad (a contractor) built me a house on my land. I owe $290k and applied for a mortgage through Third Federal at 3.49% (I locked in about 3 months ago). On Friday they told me I cannot do a new mortgage as it would actually be a refinance because since the house is already built on my land, I actually own it. Now the bank wants me to reapply at a 5.1% because it is a refinance. 

So my question is what should I do? The prior bank appraisal came back at $595k for the house so I could pull a HELOC I suppose but I also feel like maybe I could argue with the bank to try and get them to honor the 3.49% as a refinance instead of new purchase?",finance,1653255310
CryptoCurrency,Crypto future - what may be a realistic things to happen,"There are no doubts the boom of crypto and stock market during 2021 has more to do with the trillions of fiat were printed to feed American people during pandemic. Also the low interest bored money availability. The home prices went up 30% to 40% than what was the asking price during 2019 or early 2020. The inflation of daily items went up from 20% to 150%

Now fed is determined to jack interest rates to deflate inflation. If that is done successful, then home prices, stock market, daily items price, and crypto must come down. If so, I would say downturn in crypto has yet to come. 

If this doesn't happen, then Americans will be screwed since the inflation will be a new normal, and there will be no free or available money to pump crypto or stock market, hence it will stay down for many years to come.",cryptocurrency,1653257110

I sometimes hear people say that it's better to wait out a bear market as they usually recover fairly quickly anyways (and because it's really hard to time the market). But then I start thinking about the Nikkei crash and get worried. 

So, anyone knows what made the Nikkei crash so hard and why it has taken so long to recover? Is there anything in this bear market that hints to the possibility that something similar may happen now?

A credit card with $6,000 on it that is 0% interest until June of 2023 and a vehicle loan for my wife’s car. It has a 5.4% interest rate with $17,500 owed and the note is a little more than $350 a month. 

Right now, our taxable is down about 5k because of the market correction, and I don’t want to pull any money out at a loss but I also don’t like holding any debt. We don’t have any issue paying the $350 a month for her car because our take home is close to $10,000 a month and I’m not stressing about the credit card because it doesn’t accrue any interest for another year. In an average month we have at least 3-4K over expenses, retirement contributions etc that can be used as savings or debt payments. What would you guys do? I see 3 good options. 

A.) Take the money out of our account today and just pay it off. 

B.) Cash flow paying off the credit card until June 23 (will only be a month or two), continue saving in the taxable and pay off the vehicle when the market rebounds. 

C.) Keep putting everything in savings in hopes the market has come back by June of next year then withdraw and pay everything off.

Some background info is I’m 24 years old fresh out of college with a reliable engineering job which takes in 3,200net/month after 6% 401k contribution to get employer match (61k annual). My living expenses are roughly 1,300 per month as well as future 350 monthly payment for student loans once they unfreeze federal payments in august (22k federal 4% fixed, 6k private 2% variable). I have a 6k emergency fund saved. 

I currently drive a 270,000 mile Honda that’s been burning oil for 70,000 miles. This car is obviously end of life am will need a new one soon. I’m planning on saving 1 thousand per month for the next year for a 10,000-12,000 Downpayment on a new car that will last me 6+years.

My question is should I even consider getting a used car for 10k outright. Or can I/should I finance 10-15k in a 3-4 year loan with 250-300$ payments. I’m leaning towards new as this seems like the better choice if I drive it to the end of time like the car I currently have(and I think I can afford it with 1k).

I'm very confused by this.

My gross every 2 weeks is $1706.40, but I actually take home about $990 after taxes, 401k, insurance, espp, etc. 

My federal tax withholding this pay period was $87.59. YTD I'm at $821.24.

personalfinance,Switching out of Index ETFs and moving to Individual Equities,"I am 26 and mainly holding index etfs such as IWF, QQQ, SPYG, IGV, and VGT in my HSA, Roth IRA, and taxable brokerage account. The only stocks I own are AAPL, AMD, BRK/B, and MSFT. I’ve only been holding these stocks recently, but owned some throughout the last year and kept not holding them long. I realize that stocks can have better returns than index funds depending on the etf and stock. 

I believe I have been playing it a little too safe this past year and a half with index ETFs even though this has two years have been a killer ride for the market and a rare occurrence with the massive amount of printing the FED has been doing. So holding index funds are safe for the current situation of the current economic climate, but could have much great returns with individual stocks and larger downturns during the current market correction. I want to start investing in individual stocks for much greater return and being more risky. I am young and have tons of risk even though the top names in the index funds and good companies are doing well.

For my brokerage and Roth IRA, I want to get out of index funds mainly and only keep about 10-15%, maybe even 10% or less in etfs such as VOO, XLK/QQQ/VGT. The rest of the 85% I want to keep in individual stocks. Then for my HSA keep index etfs.

I want to get some way better gains than what index funds provide. So invest in brand names I know, companies that I’d actually shop at, do business with, keep my money in with them for years, and undervalued companies.

As we sit in a bear market territory right now, I theorize we won't see another 'massive bull run' for a long time, unless FED or something changes.

You ask, how? it just seems ""HODL and wait"". True, until now. I think all people miss a significant fact, easy money. Since 2008 till today, the FEDs have simulated the Economy with easy money. Hence the creation BTC coincided with easy money by the Feds allowing huge inflows of cash into it.  If you notice the bear market of 2018-2020\~ the Feds raised interest rates, until the COVID crash. The Feds then allowed seemly endless easy money to flow into the system, which then flowed in BTC. Thus causing the 2021 BTC and alt's Bullrun. 

That's all cut off now. BTC enjoyed years of easy money, and it flowed into speculative assets like BTC. I'm no TA guy, but unless the Economy recovers in some year's time(looking unlikely now with the shortages) everyone, including Crypto, is kinda F-ed.

* hiked interest rates
* Japan's central bank creating a credit crunch &amp; liquidity trap

But none of those things are unique to Japan. Why are America and other economies seemingly so able to bounce right back when these events occur, but Japan got stuck?

My plan was to save up a couple more years where if I could afford 35+% downpayment on a house I'll move out. If the market conditions are ripe to buy then I'd be looking. If not I'll be living comfortably in a condo knowing I can afford one when the times are right.

Married 26 y/o’s with 2 kids. We have have right at 100k in 401k’s and IRAs, and we also have a taxable account with around $60,000 in it. We have 2 debts at this time. A credit card with $6,000 on it that is 0% interest until June of 2023 and a vehicle loan for my wife’s car. It has a 5.4% interest rate with $17,500 owed and the note is a little more than $350 a month. 

Right now, our taxable is down about 5k because of the market correction, and I don’t want to pull any money out at a loss but I also don’t like holding any debt. The car loan payment is a small fraction of our monthly take home (like 3%) and we will only pay $3,000 in interest over the life of the loan. The credit card, I’m not worried about. It’s interest free for another year and it will be paid off by then no matter what. In an average month we have at least 3-4K over expenses, retirement contributions etc that can be used as savings or debt payments. What would you guys do? I see 3 good options. 

A.) Take the money out of our taxable account today and just pay it off. 

B.) Cash flow paying off the credit card the beginning of 2023 (will only be a month or two), continue saving in the taxable and pay off the vehicle when the market rebounds. 

C.) Keep putting everything in savings in hopes the market has come back by June of next year then withdraw and pay everything off.

That day, he decided to short the market, and went on to become a multi-millionaire.

I've seen people in this subreddit sat that say, you should have known a crash was coming because J Pow said he was going to tank the stock market. The thing is, people don't trust the FED, and it's understandable why that is. The FED have been really dragging their feet with interest rates. They've changed their tune before. They started by calling inflation transitory. Then they talked about interest rates and inflation for months without actually doing anything. Clearly, for a while, they were hoping that the inflation problem would just fix itself.

I think that, if a documentary is ever made about this crash and the coming recession, they should talk about the modern day ""shoe shine boy indicator"". We should all have known that we were in an epic bubble and that everything was about to crash when people started paying money for the URLs of JPEGs of ugly monkeys stored on the chain.

stocks,"Luckin Coffee Analysis - Business, Comparisons, Big Upside and Significant Risks","Edit: As predicted here, Luckin turned profitable this quarter! I summarized a few points in addition to linking to the news release in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuckinCoffee/comments/uwp05b/the_firstever_overall_profitable_quarter/).

First, if you believe Chinese stocks are uninvestable, no need to read further. But if like many of the HFs, you're (considering) dipping toes into overseas markets including China, pls do read on.

Note: I'm writing this due to Luckin reporting 2022Q1 ER tomorrow before market opens. I believe it will be the first qtr that it'll be overall profitable - a big turnaround!

**Introduction**

Luckin Coffee was the fastest company ever to go from incorporation to Nasdaq listing, and in as fast a fashion imploded and got delisted after [an accounting fraud](https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/case-study-luckin-coffee-accounting-fraud/) was exposed. But instead of rolling over and die, Luckin came roaring back by paying fines and restitution (restructured debt, and reached agreements with class action plaintiffs); on the business side, it started increasingly fast expansion after a few months of freezing, and overtook Starbucks China as #1 coffee chain in China in store count. Impressively it's grown revenue 100% in 2021 and reduced its operating loss by nearly 80%. It also boasts an ever-increasing portfolio of popular drinks and more customers than ever; On capital market side, further signs suggest that it is striving to become relisted on Nasdaq.

In fact, yesterday Fortune just wrote [a very long article](https://fortune.com/2022/05/22/luckin-coffee-china-wall-street-listing-nasdaq-scandal-fraud-starbucks/) on Luckin, following a very informative [Financial Times article](https://www.ft.com/content/f8327af5-5203-44fd-acc7-267c7b475fa7) published earlier in the year. There's no denying that there is certainly renewed interest in this shamed company. For more background pls read these articles. I'll move on to analysis and comparison.

**Business**

After fraud was reported in Apr 2020, Luckin coffee did not expand and instead started closing shops soon after. Other than a short-lived huge boost of ""sales"" (really it's only people with coupons rushing to redeem), its sales were declining significantly. However, Jingyi Guo and his team, after shaking out the fraudsters from the company which included Lucking Founder Zhengyao Guo, CEO Zhiya Qian and COO Jian Liu, among others, methodically rescued the sinking ship, and in fact, now made it prosper. It achieved this through multiple measures: 1. Watch expenditure. It shut down shops with bad location/low sales. Did away with most of the ads expenditure in 2020. Reduced coupon % vastly. 2. More careful expansion. After initial shop-closing, Luckin expanded again, but at a more careful pace and better locations. It also reserved top and second-tier cities to its own shops, while opening 3rd- to 5th-tiers to franchisees, who helped take financial risks of expansion off. 3. Develop popular drinks. The team under Guo had been extremely good at developing popular drinks. First they came out with “厚乳拿铁 (heavy milk latte)"", then ""生椰拿铁 (raw coconut latte)"", then ""丝绒拿铁 (silk latte)"", and now ""椰云拿铁 (coconut cloud latte)"", among many other popular drinks. The Raw Coconut Latte set a record of selling 100 million cups in less than a year! The silk latte set a one-week sales record when it came out and remained a heavy favorite among customers. The coconut cloud latte refreshed the weekly record and sold out quickly in many shops. 4. Its marketing is more nimble and smarter now. Instead of signing big names in entertainment industry, it signed younger and more promising actresses (also planting ads into popular TV/NetTV series) or promising athletes (Eileen Gu, one year before she earned two golds and a silve in Beijing Winter Olympics). It co-marketed Coconut Cloud Latte with the #1 coconut brand in China. Its ROI on marketing $ was much better now.

To see how well Luckin is doing, please look at the following tables.

**Luckin over the last 3 years despite the pandemic**:

|Luckin Coffee|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Self-owned shops|4507|3929|4397|
|Franchises|282|874|1627|
|Self shop revenue|3.09B|3.72B|6.66B|
|Franchise revenue|0.02B|0.32B|1.31B|
|Operating expenses|6.24B|6.62B \*|8.50B|
|Operating Income|\-3.21B|\-2.59B|\-0.54B|
|Net Income|\-3.16B|\-5.60B \*|\+0.69B \*\*|
|Cash at hand|4.87B|4.81B|8.38B|
|Liabilities|4.62B \*|6.60B \*|7.17B \*|

\* Numbers included cost of restructuring and notes/fines/settlements

\*\* 2021 Net Income included SEC fine added back (due to class action settlement), thus positive. Operating income more important

**Comparison of 2021Q4 of similar chains (SBUX, BROS ...)**:

||Luckin Coffee|StarBucks China|Dutch Bros|Nayuki (2021 Full Year!!)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|2.43B (80.7%)|$0.9B (-2%)|$0.14B (55.8%)|4.3B (40.5%)|
|Operating Income|\-0.12B|? likely a loss|\-$0.01B|0.07B|
|Self-store #|4397 (12%)|5557 (14%)|241 (54%)|817 (66%)|
|Franchise #|1627 (86%)|0|262 (2%)|0|
|Same-store Rev|43.6% \*|\-14%|10.1%|&lt;10%|
|MC/ Sales \*\*|2.0 @ $8.2|2.7 @ $73.4|9.5 @ $31.8|1.6 @ HK$4.79 HKEX \^|

\* Luckin's incredible same-store sales growth was due to highly popular and ever-expanding drinks, better name recognition, and striking a great balance between price and quality. That is despite that Starbucks China kept blaming its drop in sales on COVID - even though Luckin and Starbucks share all the cities in the top tiers and &gt;95% overall. Luckin simply executed better, and its models survives better in the modern times.

\*\* MC/Sales is calculated using current market cap vs 2021 full year sales. For Starbucks it's calculated using the entire SBUX, not Starbucks China only.

\^ HKEX has lower liquidity and usually supports lower MCs. I added Nayuki anyhow because it's also a Chinese public company offering drinks (tea, milk tea etc).

**Conclusion for Business**

As you can see, Luckin is growing tremendously fast, improving on revenue (&gt;80%), store # (&gt;25%), same-store revenue (&gt;43%), at the same time vastly improving its margins and reducing operating loss. Based on its progress over 2021, it's highly likely that tomorrow's 2022Q1 ER will show the first overall profitable quarter!

Luckin is growing revenue and improving margin much faster than even Dutch Bros, but has a PS that's only 1/5 of BROS! Nayuki's issue is that it's experiencing growing pains - deteriorating margins and struggling with new stores' sales and profits, thus its growth in revenue had been slowing while profit dropping, and HK capital market generally supports less liquidity and lower MC. So Nayuki dropped from HK$19.2 IPO to now $4.8 as its slowing growing and deteriorating profit margin got severely punished. But Luckin grows way faster than SBUX and Nayuki and is turning profitable soon, yet its PS showed no respect for its high growth and margin improvement.

**Projected Fair Value**

The best way to figure this out is by comparison. Luckin is highly similar to BROS and Dunkin Donut (now private but had a PS &gt; 6 before privatization with an annual revenue growth of about high single digit to low double). Luckin is expected to continue to improve same-store revenue and overall revenue (due to expansion) at a slower clip but still super speedy (a wide range would be 30-50%) for years (it is rumored to already plan to expand abroad, starting with some Asian countries, either Middle East or SEA). A fair PS for Luckin without the risk factors to be discussed below should be at least 8. BROS post profit warning still has a PS &gt;= 7.5. **A PS = 8 would put Luckin share price at $33**. Due to the expansion, Luckin share price likely will have a compounded growth of &gt;35% for possibly a few years. Any delayed realization of its fair share price now will likely lead to faster SP growth in the future when risks are resolved (like HFCAA, market condition improves)

**Risk Factors and Remedies**

1. Being a Chinese stock. We all know KWEB (Chinese internet company ETF) dropped 70% due to various factors: Chinese regulatory pressure/uncertainty; HFCAA delisting threat in 2024; US-China relationship deterioration; Worries that Chinese stocks would follow Russian stocks if China gets sanctioned.
2. Being an OTC stock. Luckin is still OTC Pink, so many funds who can't invest in OTC stocks won't be able to buy it. Robinhood still doesn't allow buying most OTC stocks.
3. Concentrated ownership. Centurium now owns &gt;20% of all shares and &gt;50% voting rights. It might scare some funds away when one fund has such a big say in a company.
4. Chinese economy concerns - due to regulatory issues and lockdown worries.
5. What if Luckin lies again?

However, much of the risk factors are remedied, being remedied, or will likely get remedied:

1. Chinese regulatory pressure was lifted mostly this year. Chinese economy was slowing, putting pressure on the government to stop its clamping down on capital investment, real estate and other markets. It also made Chinese regulators an active participant in HFCAA negotiation with US counterparts. Since late Dec. 2021, we've heard multiple times from Chinese officials promising a satisfactory result negotiating HFCAA, and it led to at least 2-3 decent rallies in Chinese stocks. Not fully resolved, but promising. China is also backing away from its support of Russia in some ways and reducing tension on that front. The mid March concern that Chinese stock will follow Russian's are mostly gone. Now it's mostly about HFCAA.
2. Luckin won't always be on OTC. In its [most recent statement](https://investor.luckincoffee.com/news-releases/news-release-details/company-statement) denying seeking HK listing, it more than hinted at its working at relisting in US (most likely Nasdaq). While relisting takes quite a while, Luckin has at least done a lot towards that: It emerged from Bankruptcy, settled debt, settled class action lawsuit (will likely get finalized in July), paid fines, kicked out all fraudsters in the company, Centurium even bought all the shares owned by the fraud-creating founder so he's not only not in the company, but doesn't own part of the company either, multiple measures implemented to address corporate governance weakness to prevent fraud again. It pretty much addressed the 2 main issues that Nasdaq listed when it booted Luckin. So while it still takes time, relisting would be Luckin's next step.
3. Centurium's ownership is concerning, but it's done a lot to make sure Luckin survives and thrives. Without Centurium, Luckin would've rolled over and died in 2020 already. So Centurium's interest is tied with Luckin, and with its stake, its best chance at making money is to make sure Luckin can do well, make amends, appease all investors so it can get back to Nasdaq. So Centurium's goals are aligned with ours - even though we cannot fully rule out that if things don't go well, Centurium has a chance to find enough votes to take Luckin private (however, not only that takes 67% total votes, but they need 90% votes to force others to sell the shares to them. Not to mention that if the price isn't good, we can sue them. Michael Dell was sued and lost when he tried to take Dell private with a low price). So this risk factor isn't as bad as it sounds.
4. Chinese government is concerned over its slowing economy amid lockdowns. It is slowly but surely reopening cities and stimulating real estate market and lending through lower rates. It stopped clamping down markets and even have extremely high ranking officials came out and said China welcome its companies to go IPO domestically and in US. I have confidence that China realized the mistake of last year that sent investors fleeing Chinese stock and Chinese market. Things are getting better. Chinese vaccination rate is improving fast after Shanghai lockdown. It is possible that in the future strict lockdown is no longer needed. Also Luckin was doing quite well in cities not locked down, and it has locations in about 400 cities as I remember - even though Shanghai has more Luckin shops than other cities. Moreover, US economy growth is now in doubt due to high inflation, a very tight labor market, rate hikes, QT reducing liquidity (we already saw the a volatility even without QT), and sad realization that inflation might not be eradicated by hikes/QT but could come back when Feds have to ease again to avoid recession. China suddenly doesn't look so bad any more - risky but will quite possibly grow faster than US for at least the near future. This is why many funds are investing in the markets abroad again including the battered Chinese stocks. The Chinese stock market rebounded 10% in the last month or so due to such expectations (more accommodative environment leads to higher growth/recovery from lockdowns).
5. Nothing is gonna prevent any company from lying. But like I said, Luckin already kicked all fraudsters out and implemented measures to prevent similar thing happen again. Moreover, because its business can relatively easily be monitored (Muddy Waters sent people to their shops to count sales and got receipts to get per-cup price and identified the fraud), same measure is being done by dozens of volunteers who live in China on XueQiu (Snowball) and Stocktwits to monitor Luckin's sales. Their reports checked out well with Luckin's post-fraud ER. I also personally monitors Chinese social media and news reports. And recent FT, Fortune etc reports were all convinced that Luckin's business is thriving. It really is. And frankly, with all eyes on Luckin, it is the least likely Chinese/US company to cook its books because if it does it again, everyone in the company will lose their great job at the thriving business. Why do that? Other companies might commit a fraud and get by but not Luckin. They do it again, they're dead. They don't have anything to gain. Nothing is 100% but the cross examination by multiple ways is making sure they're very clean.

**Final Words**

Luckin is still a risky stock and won't jump to anywhere near $33 yet due to the remaining unresolved risks. However, given its industry, growth, and how well it's being run by the current management and product development team, it might offer the best risk/reward ratio given how depressed its valuation is compared to peers growing at similar rate with similar profit margins. If you have a cardinal rule that you don't invest in Chinese stocks or stocks with fraud before, then OK skip it. Otherwise it's a stock that you don't want to just dismiss or miss. Do your own DD and decide if you'd like to invest. The next 3 positive events for Luckin: Lockdown truly ends for Shanghai and large cities, 2022 Q1 ER, possible HFCAA resolution, will all give stock price a boost. Chinese regulators have been saying they're confident agreement will be reached in or before June, let's see.

Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with Luckin in any way. I do own Luckin shares however. I do insane amount of DD on this stock and it's the #1 stock in my portfolio. Welcome to come to r/LuckinCoffee to check out my various predictions/analysis on this stock!",finance,1653313739

So Here is my story. I sold my home/business, and moved across the country to live somewhere different (Virginia). I Love it here. However, my big dilemma is now I have 250k in cash, and no clue what to do with it. I don't know if I should find a business to buy, invest it in real estate, the market, or something else I might be missing. I have been a business owner my whole life so that does not bother me, however I would like to buy an already established business rather than start from scratch again.  

The con to buying an established business is that there just does not seem to be much for sale right now, and with all the turmoil in the market right now I am questioning if this is even a good time to do so.

I have thought about possibly building storage units since I believe I could use an SBA 504 loan for them. Another though would be to purchase multi-family apartments but interest rates have significantly gone up so I am not sure if I missed the boat on this. It is important to note that I have never really been a landlord. 

I should also add that I have very low overhead since I paid cash for my house.\\

investing,Can BABY Solve The Formula Shortage?,"As the formula shortage continues to grip the US, many parents have been left struggling to access the product they rely on to feed their babies. At the start of May, 43% of baby formula was out of stock at retailers, according to Datasembly, a product data firm. One mother, speaking to the New York Times, described the situation as “a nightmare”.

Here’s a look at how the problem started, what parents can do and what the FDA and government are doing to try to end the shortage.

In February, Abbott Laboratories, maker of popular baby formulas, closed a manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan, after it recalled infant formula products when a federal investigation started after four babies taking the formula developed bacterial infections, two of whom died. Abbott has said there is no link between its formula and the illnesses. Baby formula was already being affected by pandemic-related supply chain problems, but the Michigan plant closure “really exacerbated things”, said Dr. Christopher Duggan, director of the Center for Nutrition at Boston children’s hospital.

Dr. Ann Kellam's, a University of Virginia faculty pediatrician and board president of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, explains: “This is a really difficult situation to be in. It’s hard enough to be a parent to a baby, infant or toddler, and it’s OK to use a different brand of formula than you’re used to using.” For children with a medical condition that is treated with formula, however, parents must talk with their pediatrician or a pediatric registered dietitian to ensure a switch will be safe and well tolerated, said Duggan.

If a mother has been partially breastfeeding and their baby is four months old or younger, there are also ways to boost production but parents should see a lactation consultant or breastfeeding medicine physician, said Kellam's, whose organization published a list of recommendations.

However, families could soon see some relief. The FDA and Abbott have reached a proposed settlement that would allow the company to reopen the closed Michigan facility, with oversight from an independent expert, according to the agency. The company stated it could restart the site within two weeks and that it would then take an additional six to eight weeks before its products are available.

The FDA has also announced a series of measures designed to increase supply. On Monday, the agency said it would implement processes to make it easier for foreign baby formula manufacturers to sell their products in the US. Currently the US produces about 98% of formula domestically.

The FDA will also, on a case-by-case basis, ease some of the requirements it puts on formula companies, for example around labeling.

Some are calling for federal action to tackle the monopoly a handful of companies have on the formula market. Booker, Warren and other senators call for immediate antitrust review in their letter to Vilsack, writing: “This is yet another example of how alarming levels of consolidation hurt American families and can no longer be ignored”

So let's dive right into it, and allow me to introduce to you a company who may be able to shift some gears. ELSE Nutrition is an Israel-based food and nutrition company, develops innovative clean labeled plant-based food and nutrition that produces all-natural, dairy-free, soy-free, and healthy food and nutrition products for infants, toddlers, children, and adults. With the rise in cases of dairy intolerance in babies, there is a greater demand for organic and clean-labeled infant nutrition products. The company’s products are 100% natural and plant-based, made from almonds, buckwheat, and tapioca. Free of hormones, antibiotics, gluten, and other hazardous ingredients, allowing them to get a first-mover advantage in this market.

Else has become well positioned for leadership in the space. With a growing shortage of baby products and a desperate need for toxic-free products, Else Nutrition (BABY) is reshaping the industry and filling a market gap with its plant-based and heavy-metal-free baby food products.

Following an investigation into possible contamination in Abbott’s baby products, the products were recalled from shelves, and the company closed its largest formula manufacturing plant. According to Datasembly, a data analytics firm, baby formula supply shortages increased to 40% last week from 11% in November 2021, although the FDA claims to be working with American manufacturers to increase output and streamline paperwork to allow more imports. Moreover, recent consumer reports have revealed that 50 well-known infant nutrition products contain high levels of heavy metals, adding to the pressure.

The company is a strong player in the plant-based infant formula and pediatric nutrition markets, with the opportunity for significant investment in innovation. With the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) support, Else’s products can now reach low-income families who can benefit from the cleanest, purest, and most complete nutrition available.

The company recently announced that Amazon would accept Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) purchases of Else Nutrition products, allowing SNAP users to buy food with SNAP benefits in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. 

This step will undoubtedly increase brand awareness and revenue growth for the company, but it will also provide Else Nutrition with a way to address the CURRENT supply shortages. The growing acceptance of the company’s products among parents and government approval indicates that the company is prepared to take over existing manufacturers that remain ignorant of toxic metals in their products.

The use of the cleanest ingredients and the most stringent processing methods to ensure purity has resulted in the company pushing the industry toward safer and better newborn nutrition solutions. ELSE’s commitment to addressing heavy metals issues by developing a safe line of newborn nutrition products earned it the Clean Label Project Purity Award for its Super Cereal for Babies. Else, is the first and only baby cereal product in the United States to receive this award, testing for over 400 impurities, heavy metals, and toxins such as arsenic and lead cadmium.

Bottom line, Else is primed for growth and is highly undervalued. They have made steady progress in the last few months, becoming Amazon’s number one,  best selling baby and infant formula product and winning numerous awards for its clean and safe plant-based baby products. Now the company is emerging as THE one that could solve the shortage of baby food products today.",finance,1653322911

personalfinance,The Math on Series I Saving Bond (ibond) Returns,"With inflation being very high lately there has been a surge in community interest in Series I savings bonds, or ibonds, whose returns are pegged to the inflation rate. I see a lot of posts of people confused on how ibond returns function or who are misinterpreting the returns...typically overstating them.

Series I bonds have two returns.  A fixed rate of return which remains, as you might expect, fixed through the life of the bond and a variable rate which is based on inflation and is recalculated twice a year, specifically on May 1st and Nov 1st of each year.

The current fixed rate is 0% and the current inflation rate for the period from May 1st 2022 to Oct 31st 2022 is 9.62% annualized.  The next rate will be for the period from Nov 1st 2022 to April 30th 2023 but that rate is yet to be determined on the basis of inflation up to that period.

When you purchase an ibond you get the fixed rate at the time of purchase for the life of the bond (which is currently 0%) and the inflation rate for 6 months from your date of purchase set to whatever the inflation rate is at the time, this is referred to as the composite rate.

What that means is that if you bought an ibond today you would get 0% + 9.62% composite rate annualized for the next 6 months from 5/1/2022 to 10/31/2022.  If you bought June 5th it would be from 6/1/2022 to 11/30/2022.  After that the next 6 months would be with whatever the next inflation rate is which will be announced Nov 1st plus 0%.

The rates of return, it should be noted, are annualized.  That means that for 6 months you will earn 9.62% at an annual rate, which would mean 9.62 / 12 = 0.802% per month or 4.81% for 6 months.  It does NOT mean that you will get a 9.62% return in 6 months which is a mistake I have seen get made.

Unlike many other bonds you do get compounding interest with ibonds however it compounds semiannually rather than the continuously you may be used to from stocks.  That means that every 6 months any accumulated interest thusfar will be added to the principal and that total will them be used as the basis for the next 6 months of interest.

There is an added stipulation which is you cannot withdraw the funds for 1 year and if you withdraw the funds between 1 year and 5 years then you will lose the last 3 months of interest.  The way this manifests is that the last 3 months of interest will not show in your balance if you check your account.

So, with all of that said, if you bought a $10k Series I bond sometime between 5/1/2022 and 10/31/2022 this is what your balance would look like month to month.  For now we will ignore the 3 month penalty but Ill bring that back in later at the end.

Month 1: $10,080.17

Month 2: $10,160.33

Month 3: $10,240.50

Month 4: $10,320.67

Month 5: $10,400.84

Month 6: $10,481

Now, we don't know what the rate will be starting in November but with all the Fed is doing chances are its going to be a bit lower (but we don't know).  Lets assume the next period would be 6%.

At month 7 the interest starts to apply 6 month balance of $10k principal and $481 interest.  Its annualized again so its 0.5% per month

Month 1: $10,080.17

Month 2: $10,160.33

Month 3: $10,240.50

Month 4: $10,320.67

Month 5: $10,400.84

Month 6: $10,481

Month 7: $10,533.40

Month 8: $10,585.81

Month 9: $10,638.23

Month 10: $10,690.62

Month 11: $10,743.03

Month 12: $10,795.43

But, due to the 3 month penalty, this is not what your account balance would look like if you checked it every month after your initial purchase.  It would look like this:

Month 1: $10,000

Month 2: $10,000

Month 3: $10,000

Month 4: $10,080.17

Month 5: $10,160.33

Month 6: $10,240.50

Month 7: $10,320.67

Month 8: $10,400.84

Month 9: $10,481

Month 10: $10,533.40

Month 11: $10,585.80

Month 12: $10,638.22

So, after one year you withdraw and you get your principal $10k plus the $638.22 interest.  However interest made off of a bond is taxed as income and as such will be taxed at whatever your marginal tax rate is.  So, for example, if your marginal tax rate is 24% then you will owe $153.17 in taxes which means your total return will be $485.05.  That means the return for a year would be 4.85%.

If you wait 3 more months and don't withdraw until month 15 then you will get the full annualized 9.62% for 6 months and example 6% annualized for 6 months or $10,795.43.  After taxes $604.53 which would be a 4.83% annualized return.  So in that scenario unless the next period is significantly higher inflation it would be better to just pull out at 12 months (depending on your goals).

ibonds are a great option for guaranteed return for any money that you don't need for one year but you will want as cash in the short term. For example say you want to buy a car in 2 years, i bonds would be a great place to stash money in two rounds of $10k purchases.  That said, longterm, ibonds are probably not the best investment. Total stock market longterm tends to return at \~9% for comparison. Regardless of how you view it though its important to understand what the returns will actually look like though so you aren't disappointed by assuming you are going to be seeing 10%+ returns off your ibond purchase.

**EDIT:**  thank you to u/zacce for pointing out some finer detail on the math the cause these values to be slightly off primarily due to rounding differences caused by the $10k bond basically being comprised of 400 individual $25 dollar bonds.  This causes the math to be slightly different resulting in being off by a couple of dollars.

There is also a website calculator he linked to specifically for figuring out your ibond yields here.

[http://eyebonds.info/ibonds/index.html](http://eyebonds.info/ibonds/index.html)

**EDIT2:** Another major thing to consider with Series I bonds.  They are one of the only government bonds that offers compounding interest.  Series I savings bond interet compounds semiannually.  US Treasury bonds and notes do not compound.Why is this important?  Lets say (hypothetically, these rates don't exist) you could get a US Treasury bond at a guaranteed annual rate of 12% a year for 30 years every year or you could get a Series I Bond at a guaranteed annual rate of 8% a year for 30 years every year.  You can put $10,000 into one of them but only one.  Which one would you choose? How much would you end up with after 30 years?

Treasury bond, simple interest..no compounding.  Every year you get 12% of $10,000 so you get $1,200 every year for 30 years plus your principal back.  So you get $46,000.

Series I Savings bond, interest compounds semiannually.  Meaning every 6 months the accrued interest is counted as principal for the next round of interest.  So for the first 6 months you get $400, but for the next you get $416, and the next you get $433.  After 30 years you end up with $105,200.

Pay attention to compounding not just annualized rate of return, it matters.",finance,1653327339

personalfinance,"[Illinois, USA] My company has been deducting 30 minutes from my paycheck almost every day since I choose not to take my lunch break","I am an 18 year old male and I started my first ever job around 10 months ago. I am an hourly employee and my company gives employees two paid 15-minute breaks and one unpaid 1-hour lunch break in each day. For every hour over 40 hours in a week, we are paid 1.5 times our regular hourly wage.

As someone who is young, not yet prone to burn-out, and wants to have a lot of money, I stopped taking my unpaid lunch breaks about 2 months into employment. I eat my actual lunch on one of the 15-minute breaks and this way I get to work an extra hour per day without having to work late or come in early. The company is fine with the unapproved overtime and some other people do this as well. The overtime really adds up so I'm quite happy with it, and I can still take my break if I need to/want to for any reason.

However, I just found out today that ADP seems to be automatically deducting 30 minutes from my time if I work a full shift without clocking out. I mentioned this to one of my coworkers and he said it's because of an Illinois labor law and if we don't take the unpaid break, we are supposed to send a message to our supervisor so he can add the 30 minutes back. However, I have been doing this for the past 8 months without knowing the time was deducted. According to my very rough estimate, I am likely out around $2,000.

I found the Illinois labor law, which states that ""An employee who is to work 7 1/2 continuous hours or more shall be provided a meal period of at least 20 minutes. The meal period must be given to an employee no later than 5 hours after beginning work"". I brought this up with my boss and he referenced the Illinois law and also said that federally in order for a break to be considered an unpaid meal break, it must be more than 20 minutes, so we are supposed to take a minimum of 30 minute breaks every day. He did not have an answer as to if I would get paid for the time I missed or not, he just told me to talk to HR.

Before I talk to HR, I have a few questions. First of all, the law says the employee ""shall be provided"" the meal period. Does this mean I have to take it, or does it just mean that the company must offer me this period? If I do actually have to take it, who is breaking the law here? Me for not taking the break or the company for not forcing me to take the break? My last question is do I have any hope of getting paid for that time?

CryptoCurrency,Loopring and GME have a chance to trigger something huge (and crypto will benefit),"I get it GME and Loopring are both memes yada yada yada, but there is a perfect storm brewing:  


Inflation is running rampant, markets are collapsing, banks have super high interest rates, and in general, there seems to be a general distrust in the established authority, who time and time we have watched bail out the big guys and watched as they make promises only to come up with excuses and more funding of wars.   


Point is the loopring and gme has a major following, and are loyal to these projects, and what are these projects trying to do?   


Well, they are trying to get rid of the status quo, with banks and exchanges, and even though their base may not be the most mature group, they are willing to take that plunge and 'buy into' what the ceo of GME is selling, and often times its that blind faith in something that can yield amazing results. There is a vision, there is a substantial user base of younger individuals poised to bring newer people into he fold. The infrastructure has been released and is getting immediate adoption. Regulation has been making its rounds through government. You can pay in crypto. The groundwork is set...

As people pull  their money of out of these institutions, fearful of collapse, it only makes sense that a new system will rise in it's place.

It will no longer be speculative, it will live, in the wild as an example of the promise of crypto on the center stage.

It ""might make sense"" for the Federal Reserve to pause further interest rate hikes following expected half-point rate increases over the next two months as the central bank assesses the impact on inflation and the economy, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Monday.

We can't afford more algo stable explosions (de-fi contagion risk), Milady NFT's (reputational risk), or Tether (systemic risk). We have to take them out before they take us out...","If only. If only we lived in a world where each blockchain project could pursue its own goals, establish its own niche, and succeed or fail entirely on its own merits.

Unfortunately this is the *age of networks*, and we will collectively sink or swim based on *network effects*. On the plus side, this means that a critical mass of legit projects like Ethereum / Solana / Algo / Tezos / etc. creates momentum and a narrative that attracts developers, investment, and public interest that is more than the sum of its parts. This kind of competition actually is the ""tide that lifts all boats"", and it is important to avoid tearing each other apart and creating a toxic atmosphere.

On the negative side, it means that when projects fail, *their collective failure does more damage than the sum of their parts too*. Just looking at the discussion this month, what are we seeing that is hurting us beyond stock prices &amp; Fed interest rate hikes outside of our control?

* When an algo stablecoin collapses, it doesn't just bring down its own ecoystem. It seriously undermines the narrative and confidence in stablecoins at large. And it continues to generate headlines about instability, potential prosecutions, and even whistleblowers alleging industry collusion. And it could be even worse in the future! We've come extremely close to a contagion cascade in the past; Celsius Network, for instance, pulled billions of dollars out of a certain de-fi protocol just days before it imploded, and it's probably happened other times that we don't know of. Yes, it is terrible when us little guys get wiped out. But we have a lot more to fear from a complete chain-reaction meltdown that could set all of us back 5 years, no matter what bags we're holding.

* Right now, whether we like it or not (I don't), NFT's are a primary way that both influencers and regular people interact with the crypto space. Especially on social media. And what NFT project is being talked about the most today on Twitter? The Milady project/Spice DAO which bought the Dune book. **Why are people talking about it? Because the founding team just got outed for being involved in a [literal 4chan nazi pedophile pro-anorexia suicide cult](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=founder-of-milady-nft-project-revealed-to-have-horrifying-history).** No, I'm not joking. Do I have to point out what is going to happen once the press and crypto haters get ahold of this one? And this was entirely preventable, the background of the devs was easily findable for months, and if you just look at the fucking lolita NFT's they're obviously creepy as hell and the whole thing gives off bizarre vibes. And yet all the same influencers and shills that sell sleepy pandas or annoyed elephants or whatever were totally happy to get on board with this weirdness, and tons of people are still trying to excuse literal grooming and abuse so their bags don't drop in value. If we let these kinds of projects raise money and then collapse in a reputation-destroying spectacle, we're not gonna make it.

* Tether, I don't have to rehash this for the thousandth time. But the sooner it gets phased out for USDC/GUSD/DAI/etc, the better for all of our sakes. As we all know.

We need a better crypto immune system to keep these dangerous, toxic projects out of our communities. When we let people get burned by algo stablecoins or ElonCumRocket or groomer pfp's or whatever, it inevitably comes back to bite us. And as much as I like the idea of live/let-live, it puts all of the things we're working for in danger. That's just the facts.

stocks,Stock Market Recap &amp; Analysis [My thoughts on why markets are down and what's next] (5/23),"I hope this helps those anyone trying to understand what's going on in the markets.  Please let me know if anything is not accurate, and any feedback whatsoever is greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

**5 reasons the markets are on a tear, is due to being driven by of worries about:**

1. rising interest rate hikes through 2022 and the Fed's monetary tightening 
2. slowing economic and earnings growth (Growth was negative for the U.S. in the first quarter)
3. the ongoing war in Ukraine 
4. a slowdown in China’s economy due to new COVID lockdowns 
5. high inflation (both domestically and globally) 

**These 5 drivers have led to:**

1. higher commodity prices worldwide  
2. worries around supply-chain issues (which will continue)

&amp;#x200B;

**Please note:**

Historically, the Fed raising interest rates have often led to a recession. One of the best indicators of a recession, is the stock market itself. This sort of a drop in markets can signal that a recession is coming.   

* The S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks the 500 stocks of mostly the largest U.S. companies. It’s a barometer of the health of corporate America and is considered one of leading indicators of the U.S. economy.   

&amp;#x200B;

**Hypothesis/ Conclusion:**

I believe, the Stock Market drop will continue until there's enough economic data to prove that inflation is under control. Emotions are driving the markets right now, and human emotions are a difficult thing to predict.  Expect volatility ahead.",finance,1653341735

algorand,I am a Coinbase apologist…thoughts on the 5.75% APY,"Listen, I know everyone on here hates Coinbase. Hear me out. I participate in the Algo ecosystem. Am farming on Algofi. Love me that opulous yield. Just bought some Nurd for the hell of it. They seem like good people. Bought into a property using Algo on Lofty. Am staking on Algostake. And this governance proposal? I think defi will grow fine either way really. Regardless, I’ve decided to vote with the foundation for now, for at least the next year. What I’m saying is I love Algo. But more people need to find out about Algo. CB can really help make it feel safe. My dad, for instance, loves the concept of btc, wanted to buy but was sketched out about everything, being the boomer he is, but did on Coinbase. There are tens of thousands in the USA who only use Coinbase, and I bet they’re much more likely to at least read the description of Algo, seeing that interest rate beside it. Think of Coinbase as like a Christopher Nolan film or say Harry Potter. They might not be the greatest thing created in their particular fields, but who knows, maybe they’ll encourage said viewer into something better. Now if a person never grows beyond Coinbase (Nolan), that’s not good. But that’s there own fault. But without Coinbase (Nolan), they might have never stumbled upon Algo (“insert good movie”). And yes, CB was how I was introduced, back in 17/18. A rough way to start! But I’m not saying to keep your Algo on CB by any means. I don’t. What I’m saying is Coinbase serves a purpose, and if you don’t like how much power they have in governance, buy more Algo and convince others to do the same. Also, if CB fails in the US…like why would you wish that? All it would do is set back adoption, like how the Luna failure is bringing about even more institutional wariness. Take joy in the success of other coins and projects, as all it will eventually do is lead more people to Algo, when eventually blockchain use goes mainstream, and a good blockchain will actually be needed.",cryptocurrency,1653347405

I just started a new job. I making the same hourly rate as I was before. I'm even technically working fewer hours as I got paid for lunch at the old job. So instead of 40hr weeks, I am working 37.5hr weeks. At the old job I got paid weekly. The new job pays every other week. What I am trying to figure out is why my the amount coming out of my paycheck for my federal income tax is considerably higher. I don't simply mean the 1 week to 2 week difference. I've doubled what was coming out at the old job. At the new job I'm paying roughly $150.00 more than I was at the old job.

The only thing I can think of is perhaps I have filled out my respective w-4's differently. I don't believe I did but it possible. The w-4 I filled out for the old job was done 6 years ago.

personalfinance,Funded Traditional IRA to Roth conversion ballparks,"I've been contributing to a traditional IRA for about 4.5 years. Throughout this time I should have been backdooring into a Roth, as my income is too high and the IRA contributions have been post tax. I'd like to convert to a Roth, with the added benefit that the market is lower atm so the tax burden is reduced. Here are the details and my expectation around the tax bill.

* Current Balance: $29,823
* Basis: $26,000
* Expected tax rate for 2022: 24%
* Expected AGI in 2022 (filing jointly): ~`$255,550 - $20,500 = $235,050`
* Existing Roth balance: $4,647.66

Based on the above, I would expect a penalty of `$3,823 * .24 = $917.52` federal and ~`$3,823 * 9.65 = $369` state to convert this traditional into a Roth. I'm not in jeopardy of jumping a tax bracket as it starts at $340,100. I won't be needing to touch this money for about 35 years, or never (ideally). I don't expect my tax rate to decrease in the coming years.

Does this calculation look right, and is there anything I'm not considering? Thanks!

edit: An additional wrinkle I noticed while looking at my 8606s for 2018 - 2021 is that Turbo Tax did not aggregate the prior year's contributions on line 14 (the one that states **This is your total basis in traditional IRAs for YYYY and earlier years**). So each year I've only reporting that year's after tax contributions. I'm assuming this won't be an issue when converting, because each year's 8606 included the amount for that year and it's essentially a paper trail.",finance,1653356964
personalfinance,Should I just take out a federal loan for the last two years of college?,"TLDR: I'm pretty sure that my dad is only paying for college out of cultural obligation and not because he really wants to and it is taking a huge toll on the mental health of everyone involved. I think it will be easier for everyone if I just took out a loan.

So I am currently entering my third year of college and my dad has already paid for the first two years. He has been saying that he is okay with paying for college but I have been pretty doubtful and now that my brother is about to go to college I am even more unsure.

Not to give TMI, but I've always had a rocky relationship with my dad, and having him pay for my tuition is taking a huge emotional toll on me because I can't help but feel extremely guilty.

He also won't give me any details about his true financial situation and it is seriously stressing me out. He doesn't seem to have a clear plan since it keeps changing every time I talk to him about it. For example, recently, he now says that he wants me to pay him back in the future even though initially he wanted to pay in full.

He has always been like this, but it seems to have gotten worse because I am pretty sure he has lost a lot of money in the stock market and in other investments (I'm not sure because he won't tell me) and my brother is also about to go to college.

I am currently attending a public university and I think I will be able to land a decent paying job once I graduate but I also plan on attending med school in the future. I will be in about 24K+ debt if I decide to take a federal loan for my tuition. My dad has always been somewhat emotionally draining to be around for my family but this has made it worse. I feel like if I just took out a loan, I would be lifting a huge emotional burden off of not only myself but my family, but I also feel like this might be a stupid reason to take out a federal loan and I will really regret it once I graduate. But I am also pretty determined to go to med school 1-2 years after graduating and I feel like 24k in debt won't really make much of a difference to the 200K I will probably later accumulate. Even if I don't go to medical school, I could still probably (?) pay it off in a few years.

I am also pretty worried about my situation since I still don't have an internship and I'm planning to go into data analytics with a BBA but I think I still have time to get that figured out.

I know it will definitely be more expensive in general because of interest but I think it might be worth it if it takes away the current emotional and financial burden that situation is currently putting on my family. I think about this every day, but I feel like if I just took out a loan, I could emotionally focus more on college and feel less obligated to listen to my dad's forever-changing opinions about my future. It just feels like the right thing to do at the moment and I think I will subconsciously feel more in control over my life.

It might not be fair that he pays for my brother's tuition and not mine, but I'm too tired to care anymore. Even though it doesn't seem like it, I feel like the emotional stress from this whole situation might be indirectly influencing my education in some way.

Also, if I manage to land a decent internship in the future, maybe I could probably put a decent amount into my debt before interest.

Sorry if this sounded very rant-y or even out of touch with reality but I really needed to get this off my chest. I feel so naïve about this entire situation because I don't even know where to start with student loans. I've done some research but I am still very unsure about everything. I am about to submit a FAFSA form and apply for a loan for the Fall semester but it might even be too late for that. My dad says I need a guarantor anyway so it won't even matter but I still think it would be very different than him directly paying for college. It will definitely be much less stressful for him anyways.",finance,1653357751
investing,Overnight Reverse Repos Actually Inflationary?,"So I’m aware that when the federal reserve engages in reverse repos, they are pulling money from banks and out of the money supply, having a deflationary effect. However, with overnight repos, the money is only removed from the system for one day, and then the federal reserve gives the counter party back their original loan plus interest. After engaging in the reverse repo, would there not be more money in the system, having inflationary effects? Is there something that I’m missing here? If not, why would the federal reserve engage in so many overnight repos when trying to quell inflation and not at least use longer term repos?",finance,1653358811
stocks,The results of Fed intervention,"We truly are in uncharted waters. We are witnessing first hand what happens when a central bank ends Quantitative Easing. The Fed has been running QE since the ‘08 crash in multiple waves and has created an extremely friendly environment for the stock market. Their asset purchases, combined with low interest rates have created a scenario where most people don’t want to put their money in a savings account that only pays 0.05% interest, so they’ve all waded into the stock market. And the gains have been good. Remarkable even. 

But the ride is ending. The Fed is doing the exact opposite of what they’ve been doing for the last decade which caused the market to boom. They are raising rates and selling their assets (instead of lowering rates and buying assets). I strongly believe this market crash will NOT be a run of the mill crash. I think this is a game changing scenario because the macro events have changed significantly. 

I think it would be smart to sit on the sidelines for a while until we see inflation under control. Have some cash set aside and wait for the true market capitulation to happen later this year. I’m not buying much of anything right now. Patience is your friend. Wait until the Fed gives some positive guidance moving forward.

personalfinance,Received Check from IRS for Amount Owed/Paid on Amended Return,"I received a tax document (1099-B for sales of stocks) nearly 2-weeks after I filed my 2021 Tax Return, (typical right?). The document indicated a total gain of $448.45, which indicated I owed additional taxes on that. When I amended my return in TurboTax, it said I owed an additional $67 to Feds ($20 to State), so I e-filed my amended 1040X and paid the amount owed via direct debit. This number made sense, as Long-term Capital Tax Gains are taxed at 15% (for me), which works out to $67.11. 

Today, I received a check from the United States Treasury for the exact amount that I paid on my amended return ($67), which makes me think either:

1. I didn't enter the 1099-B correctly on my tax return and don't actually owe this (doubtful), OR 
2. The IRS is still playing catch-up, noticed the overpayment but hasn't processed my amended return yet to know why I paid an additional $67.

I honestly believe this is an error on the IRS's part as the numbers don't lie. But there are two ways this plays out that I am predicting:

* I cash it, they send me a letter saying I owe $67. I then mail them another check for $67.
* I don't cash it; they send me a letter saying they issued me a $67 check in error and to send them a payment for $67 (in which case I need to cash the check if it isn't expired or I'm out double).

I haven't started browsing their website to even begin to find a phone number to attempt to call them, and there was nothing included with the check indicating the reason for the check. Due to the nature of my work, I am unable to call the IRS and leave the phone on hold for hours on end.

Klarna plans to lay off about 10% of its global workforce, making the buy now, pay later company the latest major tech name to announce job cuts. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna’s CEO and co-founder, made the announcement to his employees in a pre-recorded video message Monday. The “vast majority” of Klarna employees won’t be affected by the measures, he said, however some “will be informed that we cannot offer you a role in the new organization.” “When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,” Siemiatkowski said. “Since then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession.”

Staff in Europe will be offered redundancy packages with “an associated compensation,” Klarna’s boss said, while the process for other employees “will look different” depending on where they work. Klarna will share more information with employees about the changes “very soon,” Siemiatkowski said. The Swedish payments giant currently has more than 6,500 employees globally. Buy now, pay later companies like Klarna’s, which allow shoppers to spread the cost of purchases over a series of interest-free installments, became wildly popular as online shopping accelerated during the Covid pandemic.

But investors are getting worried about the sustainability of the sector’s growth as consumers tighten their purse strings amid rising inflation and an increase in borrowing costs. Affirm, the biggest BNPL provider in the U.S., has lost nearly three quarters of its stock market value since the start of the year. The layoff announcement comes after media reports last week said Klarna is set to lose a third of its market value in a new round of funding. The privately held company was last valued at $46 billion in an investment led by SoftBank. Siemiatkowski said Klarna’s decision to reduce staffing numbers was one of the “hardest” decisions in the company’s history, but that it was necessary to stay “laser-focused on what really will make us successful going forward.” “While crucial to stay calm in stormy weather, it’s also crucial not to turn a blind eye to reality,” he said. “What we are seeing now in the world is not temporary or short-lived, and hence we need to act.” Many tech companies that flourished during the Covid pandemic are now taking steps to cut down on costs as investors sour on the sector due to concerns over rising interest rates and declining market liquidity.

Now they are desperate. They lost their food stamps bc they bought an expensive car. And now we found out he can’t drive for Lyft anyway because he hasn’t been in the US long enough: you need to have had a license for at least a year.

Is there any way he can resell the car without losing too much of the value? And will he then get his food stamps back? Please any advice is welcome on how to sell a new car.

personalfinance,Correct CC Debt Strategy?,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to know what the best possible way of paying off my debt is. I finally graduated and have a well paying job now. I'm roughly $20K in CC debt. While this is high, I have no student or car loans taken out. I plan on using debt avalanche and tackling the highest interest rate cards first.

I want some clarity on what to do in this scenario. Suppose I have $5K debt on the highest interest rate card. I have a max limit of $1K that I can use towards debt per month (and all of the minimum payments are already made in the month).

Is there a difference on whether I put $1K towards the card for five months vs saving $1K for five months and then paying the total $5K off at once at the fifth month?

Thank you for any clarifications",finance,1653372616
UniSwap,"What is ""Gas"", ""Gas Limit"", ""Gas Fee"" and ""Gwei""?","What is ""Gas"", ""Gas Limit"", ""Gas Fee"" and ""Gwei""?

Many times we are confused about these terms. If you work with EVM, you must use ""Gas"". Gas is working like a Gasoline.Forget everything and think of EVM like FedEX or UPS. EVM is a shipping company. You have a package for delivery and EVM calculates cost like these shipping companies. FedEx or UPS(EVM) measures the distance between the shipping place and destination of the cargo and multiplies it by the gasoline price. The farther the distance, the more expensive it will be to ship the cargo.Making a transfer at EVM is like sending a package with a shipping company. The only difference is the unit difference.Shipping company measure the distance with ""KM"" and EVM measure with ""Gas Limit"" Shipping company uses ""Gasoline"" and EVM uses ""Gas"" as fuel. Shipping company calculates gasoline price with ""USD"" and EVM calculates with ""Gwei""

The distance to send an Ethereum is 21000 gas. It is Fixed. Distance between Washington and New York is fixed.

If you type a low gas like 15000, your fuel is over and you would be stranded on the road, that means your transaction will be failed and you waste your gasoline.

If you type a high gas like 40000, your fuel would be abundant. You can say i never type a gas on MetaMask. Right,MetaMask calculates it for you. It knows how much gas is needed. This means,MetaMask measures the distance for you and says how much gasoline you need to put in.

You set up GWEI. Not gas limit, not gas. Gwei is the price of gasoline. 1 Gwei equal 0.000000001 ETH. You check it on Etherscan and see 100 Gwei. This is the price offered for 1 gas. Let's calculate the cost with this Gwei for sending Ethereum.

1. Gas Limit to send an Ethereum is 21000 GAS
2. Gwei is 100
3. 100 Gwei is 0.000000001 ETH
4. 21000 x 0.0000001 ETH = 0.0021 ETH This is the cost of sending Ethereum. The only thing that has changed in transfers is the Ether fee you pay per Gas, which is Gwei.

Attention, This is not the USD equivalent. Does the gas fee increase if the ether price rises? Of course, if the Gwei price stays fixed. However, Gwei is not fixed. If Ether price goes up, you will pay 1000 Wei, not 100 Gwei. 1 Gwei = 1,000,000,000 Wei

That is the same on all chains running on EVM. Send a MATIC in Polygon is 21000 GAS Send a BNB in BNBChain is 21000 Gas So why Ethereum is expensive and these are cheap?

Same distance, same shipping company car(DOBLO). So let's find the answer. Gwei, i mean the price offered for 1 gas is low on BNBChain and other EVM Chains. So why is it low? Because of scalability and security. Check Ethereum Trilemma.

Well, if the Gwei is the same, why swap on Uniswap is more expensive than sending Ethereum? It's about Gas Limit. So distances is very long. Sending Ethereum 21000 Gas Swap on Uniswap 130000 Gas Using TornadoCash 300000 Gas Long distances means requires too much gas(gasoline)

So, we are saying that Ethereum's scalability is impossible because of Gas Limit and Gas. Distances are long and the cars use gasoline a lot. Ethereum is like a Ferrari. Fast and expensive.For scalability, we need to shorten the distance between New York and Washington(Snark). It means we need to reduce the gas and gas limit.

Scalability means reducing gas and gas limit. You should buy a fast car and shorten the distances. High Throughput, it is to enlarge cargo vehicles. The distance is the same, you just take in more cargo. Thanks to TobbyKitty for this source. ertugrul\_eth",cryptocurrency,1653376573

""From today's perspective, I think a rate hike in July is possible,"" explains the ECB director. Before that, the net purchases of bonds should be stopped, probably at the end of June. It would be the first interest rate hike in the euro area since 2011. At that time, the monetary watchdogs had raised the key interest rate slightly, but quickly corrected the step. In the Corona crisis, the ECB had then reduced the key interest rate to zero percent.

Forex,Is the Euro finally ready to rebound?,"EUR/USD finally managed a close higher last week, snapping its 6-week losing streak, after months of bearish pressure had pushed it to 5-year lows. The pair is now looking to extend these gains on hawkish comments from ECB President Lagarde over the weekend, as well as stronger-than-expected business sentiment coming out of Germany. 

After a brief pause in the rally during today’s Asian session, EUR/USD is rising again, and has broken above 1.0700 at the time of writing. If it can hold to close above this key psychological level, the pair could be on track to test trendline resistance coming from its early-February swing high.

Both Lagarde and Fed Chair Powell are scheduled to speak later today, which could be crucial in determining where the pair finishes the day, as well as overall near-term direction. 

If the Fed continues to look more hawkish relative to the ECB, EUR/USD could face rejection from 1.0700. However, if Lagarde is able to bolster her hawkish tone from the weekend, this pair could stand a chance of building on this move higher.

* People should see blockchain not only as a means of self-enrichment but more importantly as a technology that can play a significant role in transforming our society.
* The utility of social networks is not linked to financial speculation. It can be the same with services built on blockchain.
* Volatility is a utility killer and it starts with transaction fees.
* Few people are willing to admit that most current economic models of many DeFi projects fail because of token volatility.
* The service will attract new users and promote network effect growth only if it is actually useful compared to competitors.
* Stable coins are a perfect example of how to push the value growth of volatile assets like ADA while insulating users from volatility.
* Minting Djed requires ADA coins, so the demand for stablecoins will essentially increase the demand for ADA coins.

### How to measure the success of blockchain technology

Each individual project was created for a different purpose. Clearly, there is no one metric that fits all projects to measure success. From a technology perspective, the emphasis is on different qualities.

If Bitcoin is to fulfill the narrative of a store of value, success is linked not so much to the number of users, but more importantly to market capitalization. The belief that more institutional investors will come is attracting retail investors who want to play the game alongside the big players. Technologically, everything is subordinated to a high level of security, i.e. the use of Proof-of-Work network consensus. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on a conservative approach in terms of development. The team wants to avoid potential problems that could arise when introducing changes to the protocol. The strategy chosen is “let it be as it is and don’t touch it”.

The mission of the Cardano project is different. Cardano is being built as a global social and financial operating system. Cardano is primarily a mission-oriented project. Success is linked to the number of users the system will allow interacting financially. The team is mainly focusing on developing countries, as that is where Cardano can be most useful. Building infrastructure where none exists is always easier than overcoming the bureaucratic barrier in Western countries. It cannot be said that the adoption of the Cardano network will be easy. Many places on the planet have to deal with the lack of internet infrastructure. Adoption is thus more dependent on collaboration with governments and many other teams and projects that are sympathetic to the project’s mission.

The approach to protocol development is completely opposite to that of Bitcoin. The team strives to constantly innovate, as it considers this a key aspect of the Cardano project’s existence. As with Bitcoin, decentralization and security are top of mind for the team building Cardano. However, this is not enough. Cardano must also scale well and cannot rely solely on second layers. The ability to issue its own tokens and the programmability to create complex financial products is important.

There is no point in comparing individual blockchain projects. If we want to measure success, we first need to understand the mission of the project and set metrics accordingly.

It is certainly not true that success is measured only by the highest market capitalization. People should know that this metric may be false and may only have short-term meaning. The success of projects is always mainly dependent on the fundamentals and, as we said, different metrics are relevant for different projects.

No project lives in a vacuum and it is obvious that different projects will try to achieve similar goals. In the world of cryptocurrencies, there will be competition for users, as the growth of the network effect is one of the most important fundamentals of digital technologies. It makes no sense to be a maximalist at the technology level. If someone needs a store of value and bets on bitcoins, that’s perfectly fine. That same person may want a reliable and financially accessible transaction system, leverage a decentralized identity on the blockchain, or take advantage of a DeFi service’s convenient interest rate on their wealth.

Cardano will enable the creation of a decentralized banking system that will provide micro-loans to people with no credit or transaction history. In countries where there are civil wars, it is difficult to prove that you own property because the infrastructure is either non-existent or easy to manipulate. The only solution is blockchain, which will ensure that no one changes the records after taking power in the country. Services that we take for granted in the West are difficult to build in a conventional way in developing countries and blockchain seems to be a suitable solution.

We can certainly consider it a success if the population agrees that bitcoin is a good store of value. This is not mutually exclusive with the fact that Cardano can be a very good social and financial platform. If Cardano fulfills its mission and technologically supports the growth of the economy in developing countries, it will be a considerable success.

Each individual considers success something different. Some of us, perhaps most of us, primarily pursue our economic benefit. However, humans do not live in isolation and our happiness depends on our surroundings. We live in a globalized world. While our immediate surroundings are most important to our well-being, we are essentially dependent on the whole world. Social unrest, famine, and wars literally affect the whole world.

People should understand that modern technology can improve the functioning of our world. Blockchain is considered a disruptive technology that will have the same impact on society as the advent of the internet. People should see blockchain not only as a means of self-enrichment but more importantly as a technology that can play a significant role in transforming our society. It is understandable that people come to cryptocurrencies for personal profit, but they should stay for the mission that the projects offer.

Let’s distinguish success on a personal level from the potential that blockchain technology has. Let’s accept that individual people have different preferences and will prefer different technologies for their own personal reasons. Let’s think about what success is in the context of society as a whole and what is in the best interest of our planet. Let us not always think only of ourselves, but let us go further in our thinking.

### The utility does not require speculative character

Most people on the planet use digital services and social networks without being shareholders in these companies. Facebook is the most used social network with almost 3 billion active users. Do you think all users have to be Facebook shareholders at the same time? They certainly don’t have to, and I can assure you that the vast majority of Facebook users do not hold any shares in the company.

People use digital services because they are useful to them in some way. People don’t need to care who created the services, how much money they made, who holds the stock, or what the market capitalization is. I’d be surprised if more than 1% of Facebook users know what a company’s stock is worth. The utility of social networks is not linked to financial speculation.

Banks are the same case. People are primarily interested in the features associated with using the service directly, such as fees, reliability, security, etc. If transaction fees or account maintenance were too expensive, people would naturally look for an alternative. A competitive environment has a positive effect on the quality of service.

The first generation of cryptocurrencies has one characteristic ingrained in its DNA, namely the need to accept volatility. This can be seen as a particular characteristic that may be suitable for a particular use but quite limiting for others. For Bitcoin as a new candidate for a store of value, this is an appropriate characteristic. If you think about other uses of decentralization, whether in the financial or social sphere, you will find that volatility prevents the building of useful services.

The “buy, hold and wait” strategy is luckily not the only possible use of decentralization. This is good to remember. Not everyone on the planet is willing to take the risk associated with volatility. Most people on the planet do not invest in either gold or equities, preferring to rely on third parties to intermediate their investments. People in developing countries do not have the capital to invest and cannot afford the risk of losing their wealth. That is the reality, and let us not expect every citizen of the planet to buy volatile cryptocurrencies. That is a very naive expectation.

Fortunately, it is possible to create decentralized services that do not depend on volatile assets. The success of the Cardano project is not dependent on the growth in the value of ADA coins. Even if the value of ADA coins declines throughout the next year due to, say, a bear market or negative geopolitical events, it doesn’t matter. Cardano will be successful if interest and user numbers grow, if adoption by states and business grows and new DeFi services are created, etc.

Each person can decide for themselves if they want to hold ADA coins and stake them. The important thing is to build a system in which users pay fixed and consistently low fees for services. Volatility is a utility killer and it starts with transaction fees. Long-term predictability of fees will allow for the creation of workable economic models. Few people are willing to admit that most current economic models fail precisely because of token volatility or speculation on the rise or fall of value.

Creating a useful and, more importantly, sustainable service requires that people accept the economic model. This means that they are willing to pay for the service and that the fees are distributed in a fair way between the team and any stakeholders. If the team is forced to sell the tokens due to a market downturn and to create a financial reserve for further development, the tokens lose relevance. Once people lose faith in the token, the service will suffer. Part of any service should be the price stability offered by a stable coin.

Blockchain is not the magic answer to all the world’s problems. Developers of DeFi services should think more about the economic model. The service must be attractive not for speculation reasons, but for its benefits to the user and, consequently, to society as a whole. Those who understand this will succeed.

### How to have a great network effect

Cardano is a smart contract platform, so it will be much easier to gain a large network effect than in the case of Bitcoin. This is mainly because the platform can be used without exposing the user to asset volatility.

People who will have their decentralized identity on Cardano will not need to hold ADA coins. When the Babel fee upgrade is deployed, you will be able to pay for Cardano services with all tokens issued on Cardano. This will allow users to keep only stable coins in their wallets and spend them as needed. The fee is paid directly from the stable coin. If they use the second layer called Hydra to do this, the fees will be very low.

Common financial services such as loans or insurance need stable assets. If DeFi services are to be an alternative to traditional financial services, they need to be as similar to them as possible. Decentralization will ensure automatic contract execution, reliability, immutable terms, transparency, lower costs, global availability, and other features. All the features of blockchain that are important to people are useful with volatile assets as well as with assets that are stable or that replicate the value of traditional financial assets such as stocks.

Building an alternative financial system is not an investment from the users’ point of view. It has to be primarily a service that will have some real advantage for users over traditional services. The service will attract new users and promote network effect growth only if it is actually useful compared to competitors. The network effect is a huge value in itself, which will primarily be reflected in the market capitalization of the Cardano project.

Many people are concerned that if transaction fees are not paid in ADA coins that the coins will lose value. We certainly don’t think so and it will be just the opposite. ADA coins will always be linked to the utility and services that are built on the Cardano platform. Remember, every time users pay a fee, it is the Cardano network that collects it in the first place. Secondarily, a portion of the fee may go to DeFi services. The project treasury and stakeholders of Cardano will always be rewarded through staking.

Staking is an important part of the economic model of Cardano. Holding ADA coins can be considered financial speculation. The advantage is that in the case of Cardano, anyone in the world can hold ADA coins and staking is accessible with literally just a few coins. However, the important thing is that users can use the platform without having to undergo speculation. In other words, the growth of the network effect is built on speculation by ADA coin holders, but it is also dependent on the utility of a platform that is completely insulated from volatility.

Cardano is versatile, so it will offer more options over time. Just as the Internet has evolved and new services have emerged, the Cardano ecosystem will grow. Stable coins are a perfect example of how to push the value growth of volatile assets like ADA while insulating users from volatility. Djed users may not be the ones minting stable coins. The Djed algorithmic stablecoin will use ADA coins as the underlying asset. The more successful the Djed, the more coins will be locked in the system. A declining supply of ADA coins in the market may affect their value. It is a basic economic rule that increasing demand raises the value. Minting Djed requires ADA coins, so the demand for stablecoins will essentially increase the demand for ADA coins.

Currently, there are two stablecoin projects in the top 10, namely USDT and USDC. Both of these projects use real dollars held in the bank as the underlying asset. There is a lot of trust in third parties that control the minting of digital dollars. The Djed algorithmic stablecoin will be more decentralized as the underlying asset will be on the blockchain. So anyone in the world can be an auditor. What is worth paying attention to, however, is the market capitalization of the projects. The two together have a capitalization of over $125,000,000,000, which is about a quarter of Bitcoin’s capitalization. There is huge interest in stablecoins and they are an integral part of the decentralized space. Hopefully, algorithmic stablecoins will take over the role of USDT and USDC despite the failure of the Terra project and the UST stablecoin.

The Djed will be automatically a global digital currency that is stable, unlike the ADA. This means that people can use it immediately for payments without the risk of losing purchasing power. For the West, this is an option. For developing countries or countries with high inflation, an immediate solution to a current problem. Solving real-world problems is exactly what people expect from technology and what you might think of as a useful platform.

Note how the utility of the platform indirectly increases the value of ADA coins. The more useful the platform, the greater the network effect. A growing network effect will have a positive effect on ADA coins. A higher value of ADA coins increases Cardano security and at the same time increases demand.

The network effect can be influenced by narrative or belief in the project. Utility, real impact on the economy, use in industry, adoption by states, creation of an alternative banking system, decentralized infrastructure to create or improve social networks, and other things can have a much greater influence on the network effect.

### We are still early

The entire cryptocurrency industry is still in its infancy. Even though the whole world is talking about cryptocurrencies and blockchain, we can’t say that we commonly use services built on decentralization. In our opinion, we are somewhere in the phase of accepting new technology, finding uses, and implementing new services. Adoption is higher in some parts of the world and it is lower elsewhere. The traditional financial system has used the new industry in its own way and is looking at it as an investment opportunity. Banks are opening up to cryptocurrencies and new crypto funds are being created.

From the government’s perspective, we are at the stage where the new industry is accepted and the regulators are coming in with their agenda. This is also a necessary part of the change. Once the regulators set the rules of the game, the revolution can continue.

From our point of view, it is not important that the big players want to hold cryptocurrencies. It is absolutely critical that the infrastructure changes, that people start to think differently about money, and that legislation allows alternative financial systems to exist. If banks invest in cryptocurrencies for us and we continue to use fiat currency bank accounts, nothing fundamental will change in society. If cryptocurrencies end up as an investment, we’ll consider it a waste of potential.

Decentralization is a disruptive concept that has the potential to change the way our society functions by putting power back in the hands of individuals. Such a fundamental change cannot be quick in principle. It must be gradual. Do not expect something to change in a year or two. The decentralization of society will take decades. It is okay that at this stage we have a lot of questions about the future and that many projects have failed to implement their ideas. It is the direction that is important, not the details.

It is important to understand that decentralization is a fundamental revolution at the level of trust. In today’s world, whoever has power has control over others. Control can often be used for personal gain. The richer an individual is, the more he or she craves power, because this gives them more control. In other words, power generates wealth.

In our society, we can see this principle in many places. Central banks, commercial banks, governments, authorities, big businesses, social network owners, local authorities, etc. have power. Decentralization has the potential to take some power out of the hands of the current holders and put it back into the hands of individuals.

In many cases, it is not necessary to completely replace specific authorities. People are used to living in a hierarchical society, so this may not even be possible. There will always be some groups or separate entities that will have representatives. There will always be successful entrepreneurs who will be more successful than others.

Decentralization aims to rid us of inefficient middlemen who abuse their position. In other words, if individuals have more control and choice over their lives, it will be more difficult to abuse powerful positions. If we incorporate decentralization into existing processes, it can be much more difficult for high-profile individuals to change records, unnecessarily drag out processes, manipulate negotiations, ask for bribes, and more. Many current activities can be automated, and decentralized algorithms can be much more reliable partners for interaction.

Algorithms can theoretically take care of the monetary supply of coins in circulation, the stabilization of the value of currencies, even the rate of inflation, micro-loans, insurance, the protection of private data on social networks, identity verification, access authorization, and many other things.

The use of decentralized algorithms in society is at the very beginning and it will take a long time for the concept to gain the trust not only of enthusiasts but also of the mass population and the people currently in power.

No one can predict which direction the adoption of decentralized technologies will take. The technology has to prove to the world that it can work reliably, and this will not happen overnight. As adoption progresses, people will have new requests for enhanced capabilities and teams will deliver new features. It will be a repeat of exactly what we saw in the adoption of the Internet. In the first phase, we just read the documents. After that, we could post pictures. After some time, we met on social media. Today we order and pay for goods online and stream videos. And you know what, this is not the last phase either. Everything will go on, and few can predict what we will be doing on the Internet in another 10 or 20 years. Decentralization will change the Internet. If it’s true that the Internet changed the world, decentralization is just an episode in the evolution.

### Conclusion

Bitcoin came up with the idea of replacing fiat currencies. But you can’t replace money without changing the entire banking system. You cannot replace the banking system without changing governments. It is very naive to think that bitcoin will displace fiat currencies and everything else will remain as it is. The current systems would not absorb such a change without social unrest.

Adoption will occur at different speeds in different countries and the volatility of all cryptocurrencies will prevent people from actually using them for payments. This will be true for several decades, perhaps forever. People want to live in a stable financial environment, so stable purchasing power is a prerequisite for the adoption of decentralized financial services. This also applies to the economic models of DeFi projects. If a DeFi service has a fee of 0.5 ADA, it could be $0.10 in a bear market or $5 in a bull market. Can you see the difference? 0.10 USD may be an acceptable fee, 5 USD is not. Fees must always be acceptable regardless of market sentiment.

Djed will be an important project for Cardano as it will be a reliable and stable asset in the ecosystem on which to build financial services for the mainstream. However, don’t expect miracles tomorrow in the case of Djed either. It will take a few years before we can be sure that the algorithms work as they should. Adoption by merchants will also take a long time and will definitely require regulatory approval. It is important to look at cryptocurrency adoption objectively and not underestimate the ability of the traditional world to accept fundamental change. Let’s not just look at cryptocurrencies as an investment, but let’s think about their real use and impact on society. The Cardano project is all about the mission.",cryptocurrency,1653391504

**Marketwatch:**

&gt; What’s driving the markets?

&gt; Monday’s climb for stocks followed the Dow industrials’ longest stretch of weekly losses since 1932 and a temporary dip by the S&amp;P 500 index into bear-market territory last week.

&gt; But the Nasdaq Composite has led major indexes with year-to-date losses, down 26% and off 28% from its 52-week high of 16,057.44 reached Nov. 19, 2021. A drop of 20% or more from a recent high is one technical definition of a bear market.

&gt; SNAP shares slumped 30% in premarket trading Tuesday after the social-media company warned late Monday that it would likely miss quarterly estimates as the economy has “deteriorated further and faster than anticipated.”

&gt; “That’s stopped all the ‘worst is over’ pundits in their tracks. It highlights how fleeting swings in sentiment are now and that investors are running at the first sign of trouble,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note to clients.

&gt; Other tech companies that rely on advertising as a revenue stream were also getting battered in premarket, with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +1.39% down nearly 6%, Pinterest Inc.  PINS, -1.40% tumbling 11%, Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, +2.37% off 3.8% and Twitter Inc.  TWTR, -1.12%  off around 4%.

...

&gt;”The market continues to turn itself inside out and back to front as it tries to decide if it has priced all of the impending rate hikes, soft landing or recession, inflation or stagflation, China, Ukraine, US summer driving season, supply chains, the list goes on. The result is a day-to-day chop-fest, and it seems clear that volatility is the winner,” said Halley.

&gt; Investors may be looking for more policy clues from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is due to give opening remarks at a Native American development conference at 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time. New home sales for April are due at 10 a.m. Eastern.

**WSJ:**

&gt; Investors are confronting a range of signals as they try to map out the trajectory of the U.S. economy. Many have grown worried that the Federal Reserve’s plans for monetary tightening to tamp down inflation could tip the economy into a recession. That has been among the catalysts for the U.S. stock market’s brutal year, which has sent the S&amp;P 500 falling 17% from its January high, based on Monday’s close. 

...

&gt; “We’re going to have this rollercoaster ride for some time, as investors cling onto more optimistic data points and get fresh disappointment when there’s another downbeat reading coming through,” said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “We don’t yet know the full path of interest-rate rises or how resilient consumers will be.” 

&gt; Despite Tuesday’s broad premarket technology selloff, there were bright spots in the market. Zoom Video Communications advanced 5.8% before the opening bell after the videoconferencing services company raised its profit outlook. Elsewhere in the market, Best Buy jumped 8.5% after reporting revenue that topped analyst expectations.

stocks,Earnings expectations are getting worse! Morgan Stanley warns stocks could fall another 10%,"Earnings expectations for U.S. companies are ""deteriorating rapidly,"" according to a report from Morgan Stanley, which could exacerbate the stock market's year-to-date losses.

“Reduced earnings estimates and unexpected negative economic factors could lead to a further 5% to 10% decline in the S&amp;P 500,” Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a note on Monday. ""The U.S. now has the fastest deterioration in corporate earnings expectations of any region due to the severe 'over-earnings' of the past two years.""

U.S. stocks have tumbled this year amid high inflation, which the Federal Reserve is trying to tame by raising interest rates. The S&amp;P 500 had fallen 16.6% this year as of Monday, and was on the verge of falling into a bear market last week.

Against a backdrop of higher interest rates and high inflation, ""positive earnings news has played a key role in mitigating losses in U.S. stocks,"" Shalett said.

In Shalett's view, ""2022 was supposed to be a harvest year."" Following the outbreak, U.S. stocks have had ""extraordinary"" results in 2020 and 2021 thanks to record government stimulus. But the Federal Reserve is now tightening monetary policy to cool the economy to rein in the soaring cost of living.

The “re-pricing of stocks was driven by a reset of inflation expectations, Fed rate hikes and balance sheet reductions,” she wrote. ""Profits and economic forecasts have to be adjusted, and forecasts based on the level of a V-shaped recovery in 2020-2021 are inaccurate because that level is unsustainable.""

That ""revaluation"" has already begun, Shalett said. She sees last week's underperformance in the retail and tech sectors ""because of excess inventory, high costs and weakening price-related demand"" as a case in point.",finance,1653397256

# [Stock futures indicate the sell-off resuming on Wall Street after Monday’s brief rebound](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell early Tuesday morning as the markets struggled to sustain a comeback rally following weeks of losses.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 202 points, or 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.7%.
*****
&gt; Snap shares plummeted more than 31% after the company said it’s bracing to miss earnings and revenue targets in the current quarter and warned of a hiring slowdown. Shares of Meta Platforms followed Snap lower, falling 7% in the premarket, while Pinterest lost 14%.
*****
&gt; “Stocks are getting hit hard this morning and the main culprit is the Snap warning from Monday evening,” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge. “Some are a bit incredulous that a relatively small and perennially unprofitable ephemeral social media firm can take down the whole tape, but given how sensitive this tape is, SNAP is able to punch above its weight.”
*****
&gt; “Tech still dominates the market, both numerically (it remains the biggest weighting) and psychologically, and despite aggressive liquidation in the last couple of months, people still own a lot of it,” he added.
*****
&gt; Shares of major tech companies reliant on advertising spend followed Snap lower. Alphabet slid 4%. Amazon fell 2% and Apple and Netflix were each down more than 1%.
*****
&gt; “We expect all online ad platforms to feel some impact of a significant consumer pullback,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts after the Snap warning. “Advertising is cyclical.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Zoom Video shares popped 6% after the company issued strong guidance for the second quarter.
*****
&gt; Retail earnings continue this week and investors are eager to see how high inflation is affecting consumer demand, and if last week’s disappointments from big box retailers were company specific or reflections of the whole sector.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday shares of apparel maker Abercrombie &amp; Fitch dropped 10% premarket after reporting that freight and product costs weighed on sales for the fiscal first quarter. Best Buy shares initially popped after the company reported a mixed quarter, but reversed, and last traded 2% lower. Retailers were among the top gainers in the S&amp;P 500 Monday.
*****
&gt; The moves came a day after the market staged a rebound from last week’s steep market sell-off, which saw the Dow hit its first eight-week losing streak since 1923, and the S&amp;P 500 briefly fall into bear market territory on an intraday basis.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied during Monday’s regular trading session as the Dow jumped 618 points, or nearly 2%, following a week of sharp losses. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%. The moves left investors wondering whether the bounce can hold or if it was yet another minor relief rally amid the relentless sell-off that has yet to reach a bottom.
*****
&gt; “This kind of environment where you’ve got the whipsaw and ups and downs that are so big is a trading environment where it can feel on any given day like you were wrong yesterday and that is ripe for mistakes,” Sofi’s head of investment strategy Liz Young told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to new home sales and a speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development summit on Tuesday. Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren are also slated to report earnings.

economy,Snapchat’s Grim Warning,"Shares of Snap (NYSE: SNAP), the parent of Snapchat, dropped 30.97% in after-hours trading on Monday after the social media platform posted a financial update.

Details: In a filing with the SEC, Snap wrote that “the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated” since the company issued financial results on April 21. The company now expects revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be below its previous guidance range.

Slow: In a memo to employees obtained by The Verge on Monday, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel told employees that the company will slow its pace of hiring and evaluate its budget due to rising inflation and interest rates. Spiegel also blamed supply chain and labor challenges, plus platform policy changes and the war in Europe.

Sympathy Pains: The news sent other social media stocks down during after-hours trading on Monday, including Twitter (Nasdaq: TWTR), which was down 3.72%, and Facebook’s parent Meta (Nasdaq: FB), which was down 7.09%.

I have very good job security now as i work for a federal agency. Pretty much no matter what I will have a job. I don’t like my job that much but it’s not awful. Inflation is eating at my already low salary. 

I will be receiving an offer from two other companies soon (I assume I will as both interviews went well and I received unofficial confirmation from the hiring managers).

I told both companies that I am looking for $75k base comp. One is automotive (owned by large multinational auto maker based in Germany) the other is oil and gas consulting. I would be more interested in automotive as it’s better hours but oil and gas would let me do some more interesting projects. Both jobs would have me move across the country closer to family. 

I have $2.5 k emergency. GF soon to be fiancé has 5k and 85k in investments. 

I don’t really know how unemployment works but I don’t think I would be eligible since I wouldn’t have 12 months of employment in that state

personalfinance,"A stunningly beautiful triumphant disaster, what's the best practice here (debt, equity, recovery)","44.  Married, no kids.  Live in an urban area that was fairly affordable 4 years ago, but is today a top 10 most expensive type city.  Wife pulls down 80K in a government job, though her income is going towards a very costly litigation (her family is in a war of sorts) and her ability to contribute to the household is very limited.

&amp;#x200B;

In mid 2019, I left a lucrative career in tech to 1) start a business and 2) make improvements to a home we had purchased a year prior.  After 6 months of getting everything lined up and spending an enormous amount of my savings, I was ready to launch right as the lockdowns told me I couldn't. The business did not survive the ""2 weeks to flatten the curve"" lie.  After walking away from that, I got to spend another year caring for an ailing family member, which kept me out of the workforce.

&amp;#x200B;

**The disaster portion:**  Between 2019 and today through all of these events, the end result is I wound up with $170,000 in revolving credit card debt, the payments of which - combined with my mandatory expenses i.e. 3K for a mortgage, utilities, car, insurance, et al) comes to about $9,000 per month, over half of which is simply revolving debt payments.  My savings and day trading account, as a result of ongoing expenditure without income and the market downturn, is at about $30,000 today, so I've been cutting it close towards having to abandon paying the revolving debt and locking down my savings towards essentials (mortgage, etc.) only.

**The beautiful portion:**  It took quite a while because the ""labor shortage"" everybody talks about is a lie when talking about white collar professional roles and companies kept trying to offer me 40 cents on the dollar, but I recently accepted a job paying $225,000 per year with a pre-IPO unicorn startup, with a $30,000 sign-on bonus and what I estimate to be about a million dollars worth of equity that I am handcuffed to for 4 years, with annual tranche additions to that initial pile.

Further, the home I purchased 4 years ago for $650,000 is now worth 1.5 million following the improvements and the wild appreciation of real estate in the area.  Considering the remainder on the mortgage, agent fees for selling, et al, I estimate I have about $800,000 worth of liquid equity in the property if I were to sell.  Tapping into the home's equity to pay off the credit card debt is not feasible, given that my tax returns for the last 2 years are negative dollars and I just started a new position (to say nothing of the drag on FICO scores for having too much CC utilization).

&amp;#x200B;

**The question:**  I'm torn on whether to cash out the property and pay off all my debts at once, or whether it's wiser to simply leverage my earning power to try and burn down my debt organically as fast as I can make it happen.  The former leaves me free and with less bloodletting from credit card interest, but homeless with higher interest rates for new mortgages (and the fact, again, my last 2 years of wages have been negative) and the possibility of not being able to purchase a comparable home, even with a half-million dollar plus down payment.  The latter has me spending at least 15 months gradually paying off my debt, but leaves my nest egg property in possession.  FWIW, I have a $70,000 tax write off this year on top of all the other ""normalized"" itemized deductions, so I'm actually going to be claiming federal exempt for a while this year as it pertains to wage deductions.

personalfinance,Thinking about buying a mobile home in 2 years.,"Hi Reddit,

I've gotten myself into a bit of a pickle. I adopted a puppy in September who turned out to be a rare purebred American Pit Bull Terrier. I have been looking for house for 2 months with no luck for obvious reasons. I can't get rid of him, he is my heart and soul and I can't imagine life without him. I currently live with my parents, and while there is no rush to move out, they are not good people for me to be around.

The good news is my grandparents want to give me some of their land. The lot is already cleared out where the house would be, and the driveway just needs to be cleaned up. I am 18 and have a stable full-time job at an animal shelter, and I am so happy there I do not see myself leaving it any time soon. I volunteered for 6 years before I got the job. 😊 Also I have been taking college classes on the side because my graduating class gets them for free because of Covid, so potential schooling costs aren't an issue. I have $20k saved up, and I budgeted it out to have at least $50k by the time of building in Spring 2024. I have no other debts and have built a great credit score. (Will be 19 in August) 

I got a quote from a local mobile home dealer and they said the total cost would be $186k including heating, plumbing, electricity, etc. for a 3 bedroom, 2 bath double wide mobile home. I also have a few people interested in living with me when the place is done! I figure i could charge them $600/month plus utilities. I am thinking if rent goes down in the next few years I might continue my search. Currently 1 bedroom apartments are going for $1,600/month excluding utilities. The mortgage would be roughly $1,050/month all said and done.

How terrible is this plan? Is is doable or is my head too high up in the clouds? Thank you in advance for the 2nd opinions.

Update: I asked my bank about a loan and they're willing to give me a lower interest rate. The mortgage would now be $763/month!",finance,1653405208

Renewed growth in gold ETFs have supported recovery-analyst

Dollar hits fresh one-month low

Gold prices rose to their highest in two weeks on Tuesday, with the safe-have metal benefiting from a wilting U.S. dollar and as Treasury yields declined on subdued risk appetite.

&amp;#x200B;

Spot gold (XAU=) rose 0.6% to $1,863.69 per ounce by 10:50 a.m. ET (1450 GMT), after hitting its highest since May 9 at $1,868.69 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures (GCv1) rose 0.8% to $1,863.00.

&amp;#x200B;

Weakness in the dollar index along with a fall in U.S. Treasury yields from their recent highs has provided a supportive environment for gold, said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.

&amp;#x200B;

The greenback hit a one-month low, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also edged lower as weakness in equities revived safe-haven demand for the debt.

&amp;#x200B;

""Gold traders are increasingly questioning the Fed's willingness to hike into a recession, as growing economic concern is breathing life into the gold market. Upside flow from CTAs along with renewed growth in ETFs have supported the recovery,"" analysts at TD Securities wrote in a note.

&amp;#x200B;

The yellow metal is seen as a safe store of value during times of economic crisis and a hedge against inflation, but rising interest rates tend to weigh on non-yielding bullion.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the Federal Reserve has delivered half-of-a-percentage point rate hikes \[in June and July\] as Chair Jerome Powell has signaled, ""a pause in September might make sense,"" as per Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic.

&amp;#x200B;

""Now that we know what we're getting out of the Fed, you could argue that gold once again has a fairly clear path moving forward,"" Meger added, highlighting the market still questions whether the rate hikes would be enough to stave off inflationary pressures in the short term.

gaming,Getting One-Shot. is it fair?,"Discussion here. As subjective or objective as you please, be polite. If im wrong you can tell me, no need to yell to eachother.

 For games with health systems. Do you believe its fair to get ALL of your health wiped out by a single enemy attack, rarelly or frequently? 

Ive seen countless discussions in specific game subreddits of people calling these games ""bad"" or ""bs"" because they got a death to a single income of damage that wipied their FULL health and killed them. These were always many, some joking and taking it with fun, some concerningly getting real mad at the games.

Lil story; Never thought much of it until ive seen a newly released game, (a 2D Indie Souls-Like genre sequel) that added a few features in response to ""feedback"" to prevent getting one shotted. (Added as part of your usual HotFixes after release, These include Immunity after certain hits received in frequent succesion, a cap in the amount of times you can be juggled in the air, status effects becoming weaker the less health you have and even some attacks fixing your life to 1% instead of killing you)
These changes, of course made to reduce the amount of times players feel cheated or cheaply killed, also made the game a lot easier, and nerfed a lot of heavy/status weapons for pvp. So many mistakes that used to be fatal, are now survivable by running away and quaffing a health potion. (And i think its what they intend?)
In short words, the game is dumb easier, and you need to fuck it up several times without healing to actually die, making boss fights and tough enemies feel really forgiving. (May also be what they intended!)

-Lil story over-

Is it just me? Cause i really dont wanna see changes like these in other games. Sure, you got cheaply killed because you commited a mistake, but shouldnt you laugh at it instead of complaining about how shit the games are and encourage others to do so as well? Unless its something REALLY unfair where a majoriy of players are getting stucked at and it does feel cheap in regards of having very little to do against, (or obliterating your healthbar?) BUT. Majority of the ppl i see complain are not even in hard sections of their games. They just get hit by THAT attack or have REAL bad luck and happen to record it and suddenly the game is ass.

investing,Did a recession start at the end of 2019?,"According to NBER and the Chicago Fed National Activity Index ([fred/CFNAI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CFNAI)), a recession in the US started in February 2020, obviously due to the spread of COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns. Going into the beginning of the year, CFNAI does not show much of a decrease in activity, nor does Philadelphia Fed's leading index ([fred/USSLIND](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSLIND)), now discontinued. Conference Board's Leading index ([conference-board/leading-indicators](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators)) flattened going into early 2020 but didn't turn negative.  

However, a newish index, Brave-Butters-Kelley Coincident Index ([fred/BBKMCOIX](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BBKMCOIX), [paper](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/economic-perspectives/2019/1)), created in 2019 reports an interesting substantial drop below -1.0σ starting back in December 2019, not February 2020.  

Does anyone know why? Is it their big data methodology uncovering a true recession that other metrics don't see? Is it reflecting something that's like a recession but not quite what NBER/CFNAI are trying to measure? Is it somehow leaking data from the future into past numbers? The December reading would have been reported at the beginning of February, which is a similar lag as CFNAI but maybe they mix timeframes differently.

&gt;Snap shares plunged 40% on Tuesday, putting the company on pace for its worst day ever and dragging down other social media and digital ad company stocks.

&gt;The tumble comes after Snap issued a warning on Monday to investors saying it won’t meet its own targets for revenue and adjusted earnings in the current quarter.

&gt;“Since we issued guidance on April 21, 2022, the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated,” the parent company of Snapchat said in an SEC filing. Snap’s shares are down about 83% from a 52-week high in September 2021 and are off 70% year to date.

&gt;The filing also led its peers with a heavy reliance on advertising down in the afternoon. Shares of Meta were down more than 8%, Roku fell more than 15% and Pinterest dropped over 24%. Alphabet and Twitter dipped 6% and 3%, respectively.

&gt;Snap’s warning is also impacting the ad tech industry. The Trade Desk fell 18%, Magnite slipped 12% and PubMatic is also down more than 13%.

&gt;“We expect all online ad platforms to feel some impact of a significant consumer pullback,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Tuesday note to investors. “Advertising is cyclical.”

&gt;Fears around inflation, interest rate concerns, continued supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine have forced some advertisers and brands to rethink ad spend in the current quarter. Companies, including Snap, have been pressured into slowing hiring and cutting back costs in an effort to make up for losses.

That's all great, but the backbone of the network is a federation of large crypto businesses (exchanges, trading desks, etc.) that control block creation/signing and pegging assets into/out of the network.   


Why does the Bitcoin community support such a L2 setup that has companies as the backbone of the side chain? (Honest question, I'm trying to learn and not troll.) Is it because Liquid is not meant for the average user and is mainly focused on facilitating high value transactions between big entities?

stocks,Fed critic Jeremy Siegel now says money supply indicates Fed in danger of doing too much,"For the last year Jeremy Siegel has been complaining that the Fed wasn't doing enough. 
Today, he said he was shocked by the drastic drop in money supply, he said money supply is the key indicator he looks at for forecasts, and that he's seeing:

&gt;2nd largest monthly decline in money supply in 60 years. 

Here are some key points from him roughly paraphrased:

* I'm beginning to get concerned about too much reaction from the Fed withdrawing too quickly.

* If money supply continue to be this low will have 2023 recession for sure.

* Fed talk is already tightening the market. Look at mortgage for example (earlier in the interview they talked about how home builder stocks were dropping).

* Fed should definitely still do the 50 points, but in July they should take close look at money supply before making more drastic decisions.

* To some extent Fed should accept inflation and aim to get to 2-3% long term. Don't overreact 

Somewhere in the middle the interviewer challenged him and asked ""Well aren't you the one who was asking for more drastic action?""

My read on this is that Siegel is saying the two 50 point raises announced are good. But the other language Fed has been dropping recently about doing more -- he doesn't support that when money supply is this low.

Is this:

* Good news because if even Siegel is telling Fed to chill maybe we're not going to get more than the 2 x 50 point hikes.

* Bad news because if Fed ignores Siegel and go harder on the rate hikes we'll go into recession.

Most Alt projects are down over 80% or more from previous all time highs.  The US Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and all markets are currently in “risk off” mode until further notice.

This creates disparity and brings the same scammers around again that last tried to exploit your greed during the bull run to come back and try to exploit your desperation to get something - ANYTHING - to pump. 

This is NOT the time for the “low cap gem plays” like you tried out during the bull market.  It’s Bitcoin maxi season - even if you despise Bitcoin.  This is the time for wealth preservation, not wealth creation.  You guys have to stop chasing these micro caps, take off your bullish degen caps and put on your bear hats.  Be on guard, and don’t trust - verify.

Close the wagons. Stop trusting everyone with a shiny story.  Don’t be gullible.  Expect a further downtrend in price action.

Bitcoin,"""We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them""","This is more of an economics-related post, but links to Bitcoin as an idea. I hope this is allowed.

I have a very limited understanding of economics, but I thought of something recently. Einstein once said: ""We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them"". I think most people would agree with him.

But, when you look at monetary policy and its aims -- isn't it fundamentally going against this idea? Trying to fix inflation by messing with the money supply is using the same kind of thinking that actually created inflation. Printing money leads to inflation -- so you plan to decrease the amount of money to prevent inflation. There's not enough demand -- so you print money. Etc.

I suppose Bitcoin comes in, following through this idea, and actually providing, *a new thinking*.  Namely, a mathematically engineered limit to the amount of money available. This seems more in line with what Einstein suggested. I suppose Bitcoin tries to use a new thinking so solve a problem -- not the same thinking.

Interestingly, this thinking links with another one of Einstein's more scientific ideas, that, no matter how much energy we put into a thing, it cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Similarly, with no matter how much energy you put into it, you can't create more than 21 million Bitcoins. Perhaps we need to accept the idea of limits, as a general principle.

I am not even suggesting that having a perfectly scarce money supply is ideal. But it seems more in line with what Einstein was saying than monetary policy.

Sorry for the shpiel ....

personalfinance,"If you are the victim of a violent crime in the US, your state government may pay some or all of your medical and therapy bills","TL;DR:  If you are the victim of a violent crime, the portions of your medical and therapy bills not covered by your insurance may be covered by your state's crime victims' compensation fund.  

A few years back, I was shot and racked up several hundred thousand dollars in pre-insurance hospital bills.  I paid none of them.  That's because I qualified for a victim's compensation fund, which covered the portions of my medical bills that my insurance didn't.  I want to make sure all U.S.-based vics of crime know about this option, so this post compiles some background info.  (Shout-out to the [NACVCB's website](http://www.nacvcb.org/index.asp?sid=6); the page I linked has state-by-state resources to these funds).

**Who Qualifies?**:  This depends on the state you're in, but here are some general parameters:

* You were personally injured in a crime, or you are the next of kin to someone who died in a crime.

   * What crimes/people are covered varies pretty widely state-by-state, so click through to your state's fund in the link above.

   * Your next-of-kin should have access to the fund to cover funeral expenses if you are murdered (unless, as noted below, they murdered you).

   * Some states also cover derivative victims (e.g., the child of a murdered person may be entitled to therapy).

* You reported the crime and you cooperated with police.  

   * There's no requirement someone gets caught and convicted.

   * Sometimes, there's a time limit on your time to report the crime, ***but*** there's usually an exception for having a ""good reason"" for a delay.  I'd welcome anyone who's more familiar with the states that have time period limitations chiming in on what constitutes a ""good reason.""  (I'd assume that the time period does not apply to things like sexual abuse of children, which often goes unreported for years, but welcome personal anecdotes in the comments).

* You weren't involved in the crime.  

   * In other words, if you and a buddy decide to knock off a liquor store and he gets mad at you and shoots you, you're not a ""victim"" entitled to compensation.  Similarly, you can't kill your spouse and then submit a claim for funeral expenses.

* You submit the claim within a certain period (often a year, but in some states, up to seven years).  

   * Again, there's a ""good reason"" exception, so if you're in a coma and, you know, don't get around to the paperwork or whatever, you're probably fine.

* You're a US citizen or resident alien.  

   * Note that you do ***not*** need to be a permanent resident of the state you're seeking compensation from -- I wasn't a permanent California resident when I got shot, but CalVCP covered me with no problems.  I think I could have also gotten compensation from my home state's fund, but could be wrong.

**What's Covered?**:  Again, this varies state by state, but here are some basics:

* Everyone covers medical bills.  Some states cap it relatively low (Alabama's only $15k); some states have a pretty generous cap (California's $70k).  But everyone covers it.

   * Medical bills include therapy bills.  Go to therapy.  It fucking helps.  (You can see my prior comments for tips about finding therapy).

      * Some states (including California) will only authorize a small set of sessions, and then require the therapist to submit a plan for additional sessions.  This was ***not*** the case when I got shot -- they were covering 40 sessions then -- and I'm a little surprised by this update.  I have to believe they were seeing abuses.  But still -- if you are the victim of a violent crime, go to therapy, and your therapist can work with the fund to get you covered.

   * They will expect you to run any relevant insurance you have first.  If the crime occurs while you're on the job, they'll also expect you to go through workman's comp.  My insurance covered the majority of my bills, and CALVCP fully covered the balance (including, e.g., my deductible).  But to be clear: this is the backstop after other programs fail you, not the first stop.

      * *This is important*:  The hospital that treated me had a charity policy where they did not require crime victims to pay out of pocket.  So if insurance and the victim's compensation fund hadn't covered me, the hospital would have written the remaining expenses off as a charitable deduction.  They were extremely clear about the fact that I was not going to pay out of pocket for their services, and were very nice about it.

   * Most states will cover you for a number of years, until you hit the cap.  So let's say you're in a state with a one year policy, but you don't have to get a bullet dug out of you until 2-3 years in.  They'll cover it if you haven't hit your cap.

* Most states cover lost wages, so if you're forced to take time off work due to injuries, this can get covered.

**How Long Does This Take?**:  California takes an average of 65 days to process a claim, and I have to believe that that's on the low end nationally.  It's not fast, but it's not as long as you might expect given the nature of government claim processes. 

However, I do want to say this:  all of the medical facilities I was dealing with offered to freeze my balances due until the compensation fund paid out given the circumstances.  Some also offered to write off my balances if the fund denied my claim.  Really, as soon as I explained that the debts were related to an attempted murder, every person I spoke to switched over to compassionate human mode and bent over backwards to help.  I mention this because we often *don't* hear about the kindness of strangers, and I was amazed how kind so many strangers were in the wake of one stranger being so profoundly unkind.

**Who Can Help Me With The Paperwork?:** You can have a victim's advocate help you with it.  In California, the victim's advocates were affiliated with the prosecutor's office, but I think they're separate organizations in other states.  If you don't know where to find your victim's advocate, I'd start by asking the detective associated with your case, or the D.A. that would prosecute.  Honestly, the hardest part of the process for me was the paperwork.  I ended up having a family member work with my victim's advocate, and I recommend doing that if you have a family member you trust.

**Any Other Notes?**:  

* I'd respectfully ask that folks try to stay away from comments about politics, the causes of crime, gun policy, etc.  I get it:  I am also worked up around those issues, especially today.  But man, when I was in active crisis, it was incredibly hard for me to read comments that focused on the man who shot me or the thing he shot me with, especially when those comments were on articles or posts that were ostensibly about victims like me.  There are a ***ton*** of excellent places on the internet to talk about that sort of stuff, especially today -- I'd really love it if this space could remain a space that is safe for all folks who are needing this info today, especially those who are just entering the awful world of needing this sort of info.

* The higher profile the crime, the more probable it is that there are additional funds set up for recovery.  I got shot before the Vegas Harvest Festival shooting, so I did some work connecting vics to resources in the early days after that.  It pretty quickly became obvious that state and federal legislatures were going to set aside separate funds for those vics, so those vics I think were primarily processed outside of the normal state compensation funds.

* This post focuses on financial resources, because this is a financial sub.  But if you have a need to read it, I am so sorry for the cause of that need, and I am holding you in my thoughts.",finance,1653435003
Bitcoin,Bitcoin and crypto 'worth nothing'? Move on! BTC aka diamonds and gold are scarce. Only 18 million BTC in total exist. So its and will be even more scarce then gold and diamonds...,"Gold is also worth nothintg 'its just a yellow stone'.

Stocks are also worth nothing its just paper.

Money is also worth nothing. Ok; You can get its value at your local central bank in gold

But you can also get your BTC value in USDT paid always. So it is worth its price in Dollars.

So quite stupid  to say crypto is worth nothing!

Its only humans that give gold, money, and crypto 'its worth.'

But diamonds and gold are rare. And Bitcoin is rare. Only 18 mln (21 mln!)  will exist. They have almost been mined all. So it can or will become more scarce then gold and diamonds.

Money is printed every day by governments because they can not budget and can not handle money and can not lead a country and do not save money just spend and spend so they cause and create inflation also.

So money is not scarce if you print it every day..

But crypto and money need each other and will live together! Money is ok. Governments are ok; it is as good as it gets.

New things (crypto) arrive because humans want to make things (aka money) and the experience better!

The Dollar is winning to be the world currency just because of crypto. Because the biggest used stablecoins are in Dollar.

Crypto has a lot of functions. U can pay with it more and more even at te biggest airline this week.

At a Swiss bank you can deposit and Withdrawl USDT in the news today. And u can use crypto to gain interest on it. And it has use case a lot of times (settlement of fiat) and smart contracts on it. Crypto is creating Defi; independant financials institutions. Since the banks screwed up in 2008 and we the hard working people had to save them. And You can lend it. You can get a loan. It creates so much jobs and website makers, marketing, nwes, advertisments, devs, new financia products , new institutions meetings all over the world festivals, it creatse an immense economic wave and will get bigger.

In europe each person paid 13000 euro  to save the banks in some countries

Money at a bank cost money you have to pay your bank and they control your money and you have to pay interest. It is also in fact not your keys not your coins at banks. If a bank fails you get back only 100.000 dollar max.

In a fully regulated financial market all the banks did not know where they invested in (and those products were even regulated products!!) So the regulated market with regukated products was worth nothing. And we saved them and we were fed up with them.

But we do not say you are bad and we atre better; we forgive you but will not forget.

solar,"Solar installer mis installed our transfer switch, what should I do?","Our power went out this evening and our batteries were low, so we tried out our new transfer switch for the first time. We have a 4kW solar setup with 20kWh of batteries and a 12kW inverter. The installer told me that, while transferred to generator, the generator could power the inverter which would charge the batteries and run the house.

I started the generator up, plugged in the 50A 240V cable into the NEMA connector (not connected via transfer yet) then threw the transfer switch over to generator. Immediately, electrical arcing sounds started and burning plastic smell was filling the air. I shut it all down, then inspected the wires. The installers had wired the dual-phase output of the generator into the center of the knife switch (the transfer switch they installed), and the top two terminals were the dual-phase input for the house. The bottom two terminals were the NEMA connector for the generator inlet. TL;DR: they wired the split-phase output of a 12kW inverter directly into the generator input, and both back-fed each other.

This is not the first problem I've had with these installers: I've had two battery failures and a lot of communication challenges with them. This time, though, it could have been a house fire. Is there a step I could take before contacting them to talk to a local power authority to make sure they know about this? One of their engineers joked about how three of their systems back-fed the grid, which really scared me. I just want to know if there is some regulatory board I should be informing about this.",energy,1653459676

# [Stock futures fall as investors await Fed update](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were lower Wednesday after a sharp decline in the Nasdaq Composite during the previous session, while traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s release of its policy meeting from earlier this month.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell just 12 points, or less than 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded marginally higher.
*****
&gt; Nordstrom shares jumped more than 9% in extended trading after the retailer surpassed sales expectations and raised its full-year outlook. The retailer experienced a surge in demand from shoppers refreshing their closets for “long-awaited occasions.”
*****
&gt; Homebuilder Toll Brothers also posted quarterly results that beat analyst expectations, sending the stock up more than 3% in the premarket.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s moves came after downbeat session for the Nasdaq, which tumbled following a warning of slowing growth from social media company Snap.
*****
&gt; The tech-heavy composite fell 2.4% on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%. The Dow rose by 0.2% in a late-day reversal, despite falling as much as 1.6% earlier in the session.
*****
&gt; Snap’s warning dinged other social media and tech stocks, including Facebook parent Meta, Twitter, and Google parent Alphabet.
*****
&gt; “It tells me how much technology and comm services are still over-owned, right, because they’re the ones that are getting hit the hardest, and for good reason. Snap was really a big surprise for just about everybody,” Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “I think that we’re in just really challenging times. I’ve been saying we’re going to be in a choppy environment all year long because there are so many unknowns,” she continued.
*****
&gt; Traders will continue to parse through earnings reports this week to see how companies are handling inflationary pressures. Dick’s Sporting Goods is expected to report earnings Wednesday before the bell. Snowflake and Nvidia are set to post quarterly reports after the bell.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors are awaiting the latest meeting minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee. At the May 4 meeting, the Fed hiked rates by half a percentage point, with Chair Jerome Powell saying that inflation is “much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing. We’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down.”

solar,"Manassas, VA solar panel quotes. Not finding many offers below $3/w","VA is about to implement new fire code regulations that will reduce the available space for panels on residential homes, so we're trying to hurry (smartly) into a solar panel purchase before it takes effect on July 1st (application to the permit office has to be submitted before then). We've also got this wrinkle of having only recently moved into our home. We don't know our summar electricity costs, so we're relying on our previous home (from closer to DC) and its usage. That ended up being 15,000kWh over the past 12 months. 

Another interesting angle I'm approaching solar panels is that we've got a loft/attic office and a room with vaulted ceilngs that are both very warm as we're entering summer. Like the loft is 91 degrees despite insulation between the roof and room. So even though that roof is E/W facing I still want panels on it for the heat mitigation even if those panels won't perform as well as our south-facing roof (which we will also be putting panels on).

Here's what we have so far as quotes, but I feel like we're missing more competitive offers:

* Tesla
  * They don't serve my particular zipcode in Manassas, so even though I read that they are like $2/w, I can't go with them. I could wait until they are available, but that could mean waiting beyond the federal tax credit reducing, or beyond when the VA fire code prevents as many panels from being installed.

* SolarizeNOVA
  * Work in progress, they just set me up with Solar Energy World, so I'll be hearing from them soon. Because SolarizeNOVA is a coop, does this mean I have to wait for the bulk purchase to go through before I get the installation? That might mean losing panels from that Fire code implementation.

* SunPower: 
  * Did a screenshare with them. We were given multiple proposals of varying number of panels between 80% of our target usage and 100%. Price per watt of $3.65. They use 420 watt panels and and enphase inverters, but I don't know the specifics.
  * However, they needed to use some north-facing roof to reach 100%. That's important to note as the other companies (besides Nova Solar) were using lower watt panels and would _definitely_ need to use north-facing roofs.
  * Anyway, from their presentation and searching around on Reddit, they're one of the national-sized companies that might reasonably stay around for the life of the warranties, plus they own all the products (besides the microinverters) so all the warranties are with them rather than having to work with different companies. Idk if that's worth the cost difference.

* GreenBrilliance LLC - 
  * 22 panels of 370 watts, at $2.60/w, but their quote doesn't show panel placement and only supports 70% of our target. Working with them to see about more panel coverage. 
  * Specifically using Silfab SIL-370 HC Silfab Prime panels and Enphase IQ8A-72-2-US microinverters
  * I haven't heard bad things about this company. EnergySage doesn't show them as having any certifications that the other EnergySage quotes brag about, but I come from a field with dubious-quality certifications, so I'm not entirely convinced that those matter or that I should think less of GreenBrilliance for not having them.

* Solar SME - 
  * 21 panels of 400 watts, at $3.10/w. Similar deal where they don't show roof placement and only target %70 usage.
  * Specifically using REC400AA Alpha Pure Black panels and Enphase IQ8A-72-2-US microinverters
  * Don't have much to say about this one. They are more expensive per watt and I haven't dived into the panel differences yet to see whether they deserve that.

* Nova Solar - 
  * 16 panels of 440 watts, at $3.39/w. They actually provided a sample picture of where the panels would go. Still only 70% usage, but there's still manageable roof angles they could add panels to, so I've asked them to explore that.
  * Specifically using Aptos Solar Technology  144-MF26-440W DNA panels and enphase microinverters, this time an older model (?) of IQ7PLUS-72-x-US-240. Does that older model mean a good thing or bad thing?
  * Second most expensive quote I have so far next to SunPower. I did like that this company told me about the Virginia fire code changing soon. I don't know why they are so expensive compared to something like GreenBrilliance or why they deserve to be so close to SunPower in cost (assuming SunPower counts as a premium-tier company?)

So that's what I've got so far. I'm disappointed in my search results so far in that I had been reading that I should be looking for things below $3/w, but the only one I've found so far is GreenBrilliance. With the panels that they use I'm uncertain that they'd be able to hit 100% usage with the available roof coverage we have. SunPower's simulations show they'd be able to fit more than 33 panels onto our roof (varying sunlight), so I hope the other companies can come back and try again to reach 100% by adding more panels.

What are the &lt;$3/w companies that people are using? Are there things that I'm forgetting to consider when comparing these companies?

Edit: I realized that price per watt is significantly impacted by things like using a north-facing roof. SunPower's 80% solution is only $2.85/w which makes it very competitive I think. The extra 20% wattage that covers the parts of the roof I'm trying to cool down are what contribute to the higher cost per watt because those panels will be less efficient. However, that quality-of-life benefit of reduced heat may make up for that.

Edit 2: Wait, I may have done the math on price per watt wrong. Am I supposed to do the upfront cost for the calculation *after* the federal tax rebate is subtracted from the cost, or the cost of the installation *before* the tax credit? SunPower's 80% solution pre-tax is $35,587 for 9.24kW = $3.85/w, 90% solution is $39,455 for 10.5kW=$3.75/w, and 100% solution is 46,826 for 12.6kW=$3.71/w. Actually confused now on how the 100% solution is the cheapest per watt despite having north-facing roof panels added.

Edit 3: EnergySage's price per watt calculation is before the tax credit, so that means companies like Green Brilliance are genuinely $2.60 and SunPover is over a $1 more expensive per watt. That's nuts.

Edit 4: the price per watt is using the watt rating of the panel, not the expected production (which is kWh), so my earlier thought that things like shade or north-facing roofs would impact the cost is wrong. It's a very plain ""cost of system divided by (# of panels * # of watts per panel)""",energy,1653487664

personalfinance,How to best pay for a large purchase?,"I am trying to pay for an online career Bootcamp (Springboard), which costs $9,600 (or $7,900 if paid in full upfront). They offer 4 different payment options: 

1. **Paid in Full** $7,900 
2. **Pay Monthly** $1,590/month, total cost $9,540
3. **Deferred Tuition** $700 upfront, $70 interest for 6 months while you're taking the course, then a 36-month repayment plan when you get a new job, Total cost $14,500 if you only pay the minimum monthly payments.
4. **Loan** A normal education loan. Total cost is around $11,500.

I cannot afford to pay the entire $7,900 upfront out of my savings. Paying $1,590/month would really drain my monthly budget and I'd prefer to go with an easier option if available. I'd rather not take out an education loan from an online lender.

I've come up with a few payment options

1. Ask family for a loan to help cover most of the cost (maybe $4,000. I highly doubt they have the money to lend);
2. Apply for a small personal loan from my local credit union, with whom I have an auto loan with currently. I would take out a smaller amount ($5,000-6,000, pay the other $2,000 and benefit from paying in full);
3. Get a low-interest rate credit card, pay in full, and leverage the 0% APR introductory rate (12-14 months) and the discounted cost to pay $600 per month. (I'm looking at you, Cashback Discover Card);
4. Get a low-interest rate credit card, pay *monthly*, and leverage the 0% APR introductory rate (12-14 months) to pay $800 per month. (I'm looking at you, Cashback Discover Card).
5. Save up money for the next 6-12 months and pay in full next year. (Good practice on patience, I guess).

My idea with the credit card is to benefit from perks/benefits (Discover's cashback could help pay for the loan) and leverage the 0% interest for a year. I plan on getting a credit card purely to develop my credit score in the future anyway. This would allow me to really benefit from the initial benefits. (I think Discover matches all the cashback you earn in your first year).

I know all the Dave Ramsey followers are going to start telling me to pay in cash and not take on debt. I realize that is the smartest, safest, option. I'm looking to validate whether any of my options are stupid or if any of them are a good idea.

I hope this all makes sense. I just have so many options and am trying to weed out the bad ones. Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Looking for low risk short term investment options.,"Recently I came into some money from someone looking to invest in my pet project, but as I am still working on it, we decided that I keep the funds for a few months before things are ready and then we can use the funds. I am not a company, it's just me that got the money as investment.

This just means I am sitting on the money in my account for the next 3-4 months. If there was a low risk way to invest this money and get whatever returns (as long as it's better than saving bank account's interest rate) I would be really happy to know. Of course I do not want to lose his money or trying to scam him. In any case if I do end up taking a loss in this scenario from investment I do have the financial power to repay 50% of the money but I would rather that didn't happen.

personalfinance,"Investing in 401k, Financial Independence, and Purchasing a Home","If you’re reading this, thank you for your time. I know there is a lot of excellent information in this subreddit, which I have read a bit, but I would also appreciate feedback on my personal situation if anyone would be so kind.

I’m 31 years old and work for a cyber security company earning $71,968 gross annually, with an expected 4% increase per year. I have saved $20k currently that is sitting in a savings account and my credit score is 780. I live at home with my family because I am trying to save as much as I can and recently became engaged. My fiancé earns ~$29k per year. I have a car loan with ~14k left to pay and I am paying $300 towards that biweekly to get rid of that debt and reduce interest payments.

My fiancé and I would like to buy a house sometime later next year, ideally in the north Georgia area if finances and the market permits. My strategy is to have enough in my savings account for a home purchase, as well as an emergency fund. Is this a correct approach or should that money be sitting in an investment account and I can take out what is needed when the time comes?

I want to try to find a home that is maximum $250k. I would like to use an FHA loan is the PMI can drop off at some point. If not, I’m hoping I could put 10% down with a conventional loan that allows PMI to drop off eventually. With interest rates going up, would it be best practice to refinance after about 2 years of owning a home to reduce the interest rate?

I’m currently reading The Simple Path to Wealth by J. L. Collins and I am trying to apply the recommendations to my investing.  Currently, I am investing 6% of my income towards my 401k with my employer matching 100% of that 6%. 

My balance as of today is $19,854.36 with a monthly contribution of $324. My rate of return is currently -5.52% from this time last year and -14.74% YTD. I know that YTD isn’t as important because I’m investing long term for retirement, just providing context. 

The S&amp;P 500 has performed better than my asset mix at this time and I’m wondering if I should divert all my contributions to it and how that works. Also, what would the strategy be to continue investing in my 401k as well as begin investing in the VTSAX?

My current 401k portfolio is a target date fund projected for 2055. The asset mix is 51% domestic stock, 30% foreign stock, 2% bonds, -1% unknown (I don’t know what that means, and %15 other. Please excuse my ignorance. The projected average annual returns for this portfolio is +8.49% at 10 yrs. This fund will systematically become more conservative over time with lower stock exposure.

I would like to achieve financial independence by 50 years old and have been reading Mr Money Mustache as well as the madFIentist.

stocks,BBBY (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond) - What Gives?,"**Disclosure**: I hold a modest long position in this ticker, currently underwater by about 25%, no biggie.

I opened my BBBY position in March 2022 when Ryan Cohen (he of Chewy and GameStop fame) bought his 9.5M BBBY shares for a \~10% stake in the company and then engaged in a very aggressive social media campaign against the company's executives and its ""over price consultants"". Ultimately, Cohen was able to secure 3 Board seats on the company for his hand-picked associates, and now has quite a bit of sway regarding the company's future:

* [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/bed-bath-beyond-strikes-deal-with-activist-investor-ryan-cohen.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/bed-bath-beyond-strikes-deal-with-activist-investor-ryan-cohen.html)

BBBY is now trading at about a **0.11x** price-to-sales ratio, and Ryan Cohen has announced that he thinks the profitable **BuybuyBaby** chain should be sold off (for several times more than the company's current market cap) in order to erase BBBY's debt and narrow the parent company's scope. This idea has some merit to it, and has been discussed before:

* [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/buybuy-baby-may-be-worth-more-than-all-of-bed-bath-beyond-bank-of-america-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/buybuy-baby-may-be-worth-more-than-all-of-bed-bath-beyond-bank-of-america-says.html)

Currently, BBBY is trading at around $8, with a paltry $650M market cap, against annual revenues of approx. $8bn in 2021. It historically has traded as high as $80 (2013-2015) and even $44 in 2021 (June 2, 2021). BBBY has also bought back $1bn worth of its shares in recent years, and clearly considers its own share price to be very undervalued:

In addition to buying 9.5M shares between $13-17 (\~$150,000,000), Cohen also purchased a ton of Jan 2023 Calls (16,701 contracts) with $60-$80 strike prices:

Ryan Cohen has been very vocal on his Twitter account since the New Year regarding inflation, monetary policy, and the Fed. He clearly has more than a passing knowledge of, and interest in, the current state of the economy. Of course, no mention of BBBY and Ryan Cohen would be complete without mentioning the short interest in the ticker ([20M shares publicly reported short, or 25% of total shares outstanding. But somehow 84% of the float according to Yahoo Finance??!](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/key-statistics?p=BBBY)) and the stock's weird trading correlation with other so-called ""meme stocks"" like GME, AMC. For example, BBBY had a huge price and volume spike on June 2, 2021, the same day that GME and other meme stocks also experienced massive price spikes and trading. However, I will leave aside speculation as to what that correlation might be caused by, or what it imply for the future of the share price.

I keep struggling to think of any reason why a successful activist investor like Ryan Cohen would drop that kind of dough without a very serious plan to turn the company around, even in this difficult economic climate.

Is anyone else fascinated with this stock's future and curious to see how it all shakes out? Will Ryan Cohen's 17,000 Jan 2023 options contracts ""print"", or will his bet end up on WSB's loss porn hall of fame?

personalfinance,Help with Remortgaging an Additional Borrowing Mortgage,"When I moved in to my new property in April 2021, we took out additional borrowing with our current lender and ported our current mortgage on our previous property.

stocks,"For all the ""No reason to buy"" folks.... What should I do tho?","I've been seeing hundreds (maybe thousands) of comments on Reddit and the interwebs about how markets are doomed and there's ""no reason to buy right now"" because of the obvious incoming mega-crash, prompted by inflation for some reason, where all stocks go to their ""fair value"" of negative zero.

My question is, if there is no reason to hold stocks, what is your to reason to hold USD? Why not invest that money in something that could increase in value? Like inverse ETFs for example? I get the argument that you're trying to ""loose as little as possible"", but if you are so convinced that stocks will lose value that you're willing to sacrifice 8% buying power over the next year, wouldn't the smarter choice be to buy some inverse ETF? I'm just finding it really odd that the same people predicting hyperinflation are the same people holding cash... it's purely illogical.

**If you think inflation will cool off**, I don't think many people will disagree that markets will go up, or at least level off... In that scenario, it doesn't make sense to hold cash, because you'd miss out on obvious gains. If inflation **does not** cool off and instead increases, people are saying the market will go down further... If inflation continues upward, that means we would see 10%, 12%,, 15% or more inflation.... if that is the case, it will become more difficult to hold cash vs hard assets, like a house. However, housing prices are already at ATHs and with the fed hiking rates, housing prices are starting to decline and set to decline further... Investing in a house doesn't make sense because the fed will devalue it with hikes as soon as I buy... If they do not devalue my new house with rate hikes, stocks will go up because of fewer rate hikes...so it would still be better to buy stocks vs a house, because stocks have a long way up, vs the house which most likely won't see a sudden 20% gain.

stocks,"Fed minutes show strong commitment to 0.50% rate hikes in June, July","The Federal Reserve made a strong commitment to 0.50% moves in June and July, according to minutes from the central bank’s May meeting released Wednesday afternoon.

On May 4, policymakers [r](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-may-2022-142723148.html)aised short-term interest rates by 0.50% to a target range between 0.75% and 1.00% in a bid to lower inflation. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, which should in theory depress the consumption that is enabling companies to raise prices.

But the meeting minutes outline a strong agreement among Fed officials for further 0.50% moves after at least the next two meetings, which are scheduled for June 14-15 and July 26-27.

“Most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings,” read the minutes from the May 3-4 meeting.

The Fed is not often so direct about what it will do in future meetings, as the institution often prioritizes flexibility to alter the course of its policy as data changes. But with inflation currently at levels not seen since the early 1980s, the Fed has been more willing to offer public guidance on its intentions to further raise rates.

Following the May 4 rate hike, Fed Chairman Jay Powell told the press that there was a “broad sense” on the committee that further 0.50% moves “should be on the table” for the next two meetings.

Fed presidents that spoke to Yahoo Finance earlier this month appeared to be part of that “broad” support.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Yahoo Finance on May 10 she would be ""comfortable"" with that strategy, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the same day he could  see 0.50% moves for the “next two, or perhaps three, meetings.”

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard — who once entertained the possibility of a 0.75% move — told Yahoo Finance May 11 that his colleagues had ""coalesced"" around that plan for two 0.50% moves.

The Fed minutes note that Fed officials would have to continue raising rates beyond estimates for the neutral rate of interest, defined as the level of interest rates economists feel is neither stimulative nor restrictive to economic growth. This estimate implies rates will rise above 2.5% at some point during this cycle.

“Participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions should be data dependent,” the Fed minutes added as a caveat.

Inflation remained the pressing concern for Fed officials, which was complicated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related shutdowns in China. Both events are leading to disruptions in the global supply chain that have, in part, boosted prices. Fed officials said that those pressures could ease at some point, but the timing and magnitude would be “uncertain.”

The minutes note that all policymakers on the committee supported the 0.50% move in May, in addition to the plan to begin shrinking the Fed’s $9 trillion balance sheet beginning June 1.

Oppenheimer Says These 2 Stocks Could Surge Over 50% From Current Levels

When it comes to the market’s wild swings, is the glass half empty or half full? Oppenheimer’s chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus is taking the latter view.

Despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year, Stoltzfus describes a situation that nevertheless still brings high potential for investors willing to shoulder the risk. He writes: “While conditions are likely to remain somewhat unstable near term we’d expect investable opportunities to surface whenever ‘babies are thrown out with the bath water.’”

Stoltzfus notes a market environment facing multiple headwinds, frequently shifting crosswise to each other, making it difficult for investors to locate and follow the main path. On the positive side, however, the strategist believes that the Federal Reserve will likely play a calming role, and not just to due to its anti-inflationary policy switch.

“Federal Reserve hike cycles are never easy to navigate but the Bernanke legacy created a highly sensitive and communicative Fed, which could prove helpful... A Fed that can pivot and ‘pump the brakes’ rather than ‘slam on the brakes’ is a good thing in our view,” Stoltzfus added.

Turning Stoltzfus’ outlook into tangible recommendations, Oppenheimer 5-star analysts are pounding the table on two stocks, with these pros seeing over 50% upside potential in store. Using [TipRanks’ database](https://www.tipranks.com/), we learned that the rest of the Street is in agreement, as both boast a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus.

personalfinance,Need help deciding and understanding smartest path forward (paying off debt v investing),"So I'll set the stage then ask for advice -  


I currently make $75K gross annually and my wife's business brings in roughly $60K gross annually (although the next few months will be close to zero as she takes a maternity leave before picking back up in late August, so really more like $45K this year) so we will say $10K gross monthly.  


We currently have 4 different debts - a credit card ($6K, 23.74% APR), a car loan ($320/mo, $12K left, 3.04% interest rate), a personal loan ($416/mo, $13K left, 3.84% interest rate), and a mortgage payment (PITI of $1950/mo, $361K left, 2.875% interest rate).  


Currently we are aggressively paying off the Credit Card and plan to have it paid off within 4-5 months. We have 40 months of payments left on the car and 35 months of payments left on the personal loan. In addition, we are paying $175 monthly for PMI and that isn't scheduled to fall off until 2028 - although with home value increases over the last year+ we are planning to request PMI removal soon and that may require a home appraisal ($450-$600).  


I'm hoping to get some advice on what to do once the Credit Card is paid off. With our budget, we will have about $1,500 a month to either put towards debt or invest/save (potentially $1,700 if PMI is removed). Would it be smarter to pay off the loans as quickly as possible (would probably take another 12-15 months after CC paid off) or look to invest that much monthly since the loan rates are low? 

If investing is the route - what should I put that money into as I'm new to investing? I will already be contributing 15% to my retirement accounts and some to a 529 as well. Would getting a financial advisor be advised with this monthly amount of extra investment?  


If paying off debt is the route - in roughly 18 months I would have $2,250/mo to invest/save.  


Thanks in advance for any advice!",finance,1653514711

cybersecurity,PII Included in Audit Logs,"Hello,

We have a client that is interested in including PII within their audit logs that get forwarded to a SIEM tool managed by an external service provider. The ESP has a FedRAMP-accredited environment and their SOC Team is authorized to view PII/PHI, so I'm too concerned from a compliance standpoint. 

However, is it generally considered a bad practice to include PII or should be it masked? If masking/anonymizing is the path forward, can someone provide some justifications into why? Trying to help the client understand that there could be drawbacks to including PII/PHI in application audit logs.  


For example, this could result in PII/PHI being spread and proliferated, thus becoming more difficult to control and monitor. Anything else that could bolster the argument to actually mask/anonymize the PII?  


NOTE: I'm specifically referring to fine-grained Oracle database audit logs which capture the SQL query that was executed. The SQL query itself includes PII/PHI since it shows the specific fields that people queried on.",technology,1653517585

worldpolitics,This is how to take care of the Arctic,"The Arctic Council is an international organization and  
intergovernmental forum for the world's Arctic countries. It was founded in  
1996 by representatives of eight countries (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,  
Russia, Sweden and the United States), often referred to as the ""Arctic  
Eight"". The main objectives of the Council: elimination of pollution in  
the Arctic, implementation of the Arctic monitoring and assessment program,  
conservation of Arctic flora and fauna, prevention, preparedness and  
liquidation of emergency situations, protection of the Arctic marine  
environment, economic development in the Arctic.  
In 2021, Russia assumed the presidency of the Arctic Council, which will  
last until 2023. Almost a third of the entire Arctic territory of the Earth  
belongs to Russia, so the main idea with which Russia approached the leadership  
of this organization is the principle of responsible management in the  
interests of sustainable development of the region, the balanced promotion of  
sustainable development of the Arctic in its social, economic and environmental  
dimensions. Russia intends to develop cooperation with the countries  
participating in the intergovernmental forum in four priority areas: the Arctic  
population, including indigenous minorities of the North; protection of the  
Arctic environment, including climate change; social and economic development  
of the region; strengthening the role of the Arctic Council as the main  
platform for multilateral cooperation in high latitudes.  
On April 30, 2021, the Chairman of the Russian Government Mikhail  
Mishustin approved the Plan of Main Activities during the Chairmanship. While  
maintaining the continuity of the Arctic agenda, the Russian Federation has  
introduced many new things into its program. In just two years of Russia's  
chairmanship of the Arctic Council, more than 100 international Arctic events  
are planned. Among them are conferences and seminars on health of the Arctic  
residents, improvement of the quality of their education, creation and  
improvement of comfort in the settlements, holding of conferences and other  
events. It is planned to intensify the program of digitalization of the North,  
providing satellite communication in remote settlements and reindeer farms, to  
engage in digitization of local languages and dialects, to promote the  
preservation of indigenous languages, including the support of education in  
indigenous languages.  
Another booming sector of today's economy is international tourism.  
Because of the difficult weather conditions, travel in the Far North is not  
easy to organize, but has great potential. Russia holds various forums and  
conferences on sustainable cruise tourism, as well as exhibitions of Arctic  
crafts.  
In the sphere of ecology Russia proposes to intensify efforts of the  
Arctic Council member countries to combat environmental pollution and eliminate  
main sources of pollution in the near future. In the area of protection of  
polar flora and fauna it is planned to hold an event on climate change.  
Another important area of cooperation between the northern countries is  
the prevention of emergencies. Among other events, Russia plans to conduct  
exercises with relevant services of the Arctic Council member countries.  
Russia is planning to hold conferences on telecommunications and  
digitalization in the Arctic, green energy, transport infrastructure and  
sustainable navigation, small aviation development within its presidency. Given  
the growing economic importance of the Northern Sea Route, Russia is interested  
in the development of polar trade routes.  
During its presidency in the Arctic Council in 2021-2023, Russia intends  
to confirm its status as a major Arctic power, in which the Arctic plays an  
important role in socio-economic development, environmental protection and  
national security of the state.",energy,1653525090

We know the story, higher inflation is forcing higher discount rates and higher rates means lower present values.

That is the sell off in a nutshell.

Since it has dragged on and on (particularly for pre earnings tech investors which have experienced losses of 80%+) the mood has changed to one that we are on the brink of a recession.

We know the greatest investor of all time regularly is cited as saying, you can’t predict inflation and interest rates.

Let’s assume that Buffett is right, this means if you are buying something because inflation will do this, or interest rates will do that, you are inherently speculating.

If instead you look at free cash flow yields, you will see you are getting far more for your money then you were 6 months ago.

Would that improve supply chain issues?
Would that lessen inflation?
Would that lessen the need for higher rates? Would that increase the value of stocks?

Maybe.

stocks,"I think the rally is temporary and an overreaction. The Fed ""news"" today was bad news.","A few weeks ago (May 4), we had our best day in two years because Powell said the Fed wasn't actively considering hikes bigger than half a point.  The next day, we had our worst loss of the year because investors realized the news wasn't really that good.  At a minimum, it was an overreaction.  I believe we'll see something similar over the coming days.

The Fed is doing the right thing here.  They need to take inflation seriously, and they need to be willing to possibly even move to a restrictive rate.  I am not criticizing the message.  But the market got the interpretation wrong.  **If the Fed has to hike to a restrictive rate, or even if they have to hike more than has been presumed, we will have a more profound recession.**  This is indisputable.

The market is cheering the Fed doing what it needs to do, but the harsh reality is that correct action will result in much lower corporate earnings, layoffs and generally slower economic growth.  Stocks will be worth less in this environment.

The Fed wouldn't be discussing the possibility of more hikes or a higher, possibly even restrictive, terminal rate if they didn't feel inflation might be harder to tame than many believe.  I'm personally glad the Fed is willing to do what needs to be done, but this isn't good news for stocks.

This is sort of like going to a doctor for a skinned up knee and him telling you that he's willing to amputate if there's significant infection that spreads.  Great, doc, glad you're willing to do what's necessary, but relative to my expectations before coming to the hospital, this is suddenly pretty scary.

However, [EPS estimates recently came down to 225 for 2022](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf). So again, if you believe that the Fed will at least get to neutral (FFR 2.5% - 3%), and you apply a 17x P/E multiple, that would put you around 3825 (or SPY \~382).

This also assumes no recession this year or next year of course. In a recession, the E will come down further, so you get both multiple compression and earnings reduction which can make P/E's looked whacked out (ie: stocks look cheap on a relative basis, but because earnings will come down, they aren't as cheap as they appear).

Forex,Is there reason to be concerned about the impact the Fed's hiking cycle could have on the Dollar?,"While the US Dollar Index hit new highs earlier this month thanks to a 6-week rally fuelled by anticipation of an increasingly hawkish Fed, the DXY now looks on track to finish its second week lower as recession fears pick up. 

The prospect of an overly aggressive rate hikes and the inability for the US central bank to engineer a soft landing has pushed consumer confidence to a new low, with the impact of higher interest rates already visible in the housing market. Demand for new homes, confidence in the building sector, and plans for new builds are all on the decline, even though the tightening cycle has only just begun. 

Yesterday’s FOMC Minutes reiterated the idea that the Fed is likely to stick with their current rate hike plans, and there is now a case to be made that the upcoming 50bps hikes have already been priced in. This could potentially cause the greenback to continue lower if US recession concerns push traders away from the Dollar and into “safe-havens” like the Swiss Franc and Yen, while other currencies also catch a bid on hawkish pivots from their central banks. 

Of course, all trading carries risk, and we could see USD rebound from its recent pullback if sentiment improves. Either way, it should be interesting to watch how this develops over the coming months.",finance,1653554319

That 3-year lease is up this November and I'm debating keeping this car. (I might look at other new cars, but let's ignore that option for now.) My current interest rate is 1.9% and my credit score is around 815-820. The original price of the Crosstrek was around $36k and after the lease the residual value will be around $19k.

Further, I'm inheriting some money soon, nothing life changing but enough to do a few nice things and add a decent chunk to an investment account. In theory, I could just pay the residual $19k in cash and be done, but since the only other type of debt I hold is a few credit cards (I only use one of them), I figured it might not be a bad idea to keep a second type of debt going by keeping a car loan. I could just put down a few thousand, maybe even up to $10k, though then taking a $9k loan wouldn't make sense.

Just looking for thoughts on how best to approach this upcoming situation to keep my credit score as good as I can with my limited credit profile. (I've always rented an apartment, so no mortgage to help out.)",finance,1653563488

personalfinance,Ideas for investing about $50k (please read details carefully),"Hey, so I’m coming from a country that has about $5,700 annual GNI per capita (Intl. USD) that is about $11,000 with purchasing power parity. I’ve worked my as* off and will have about $50,000 at the end of the year in cash savings.

Currently, I pretty much plan everything and manage to save about 4/5 of my salary, that’s about 80%. So, due to the lower cost of living, a live on 20% of my salary.

Average monthly salary in the country is about $500 roughly speaking.

I’ve had some mock ups in my head, but here’s the catch:

(1) It’s extremely difficult to buy US stocks
(2) Local stocks trade at sky-high prices and have devalued. There is little to no volatility and miserable dividends.
(3) Corruption is rampant
(4) No startups to invest in
(5) Real estate prices are skyrocketing, but it is rarely the case that someone buys any property. Prices will probably fall.
(6) 8% annual inflation rate
(7) Savings accounts pay a max of 2.4% interest rate over a 24-month period

So, I’ve decided to go all-cash for now.

The only thing that makes sense is buying land. One interesting catch is that the state sometimes sells state-owned land for less than a $1 pre square meter.

Land prices haven’t been hit by the upcoming recession. Only exclusive locations have seen a dramatic increase in prices since the outbreak of Covid.

The Euro is slowly beginning to devaluate, but people here tend to be reckless and spend money on eating out and take-away coffee. 

Still, my reasoning is to hold the cash due to the huge risk of investing.

Do you guys think something along the lines of an additional cash flow made by an investment out of my cash savings makes sense? 

Please keep in mind that the circumstances do not allow me to invest they way one can do it in the US or perhaps Western Europe.

I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",finance,1653571385

personalfinance,Responding to Large Job Offer versus Comfort: SF Bay Area versus Nashville,"I remember seeing a post a little over a week ago about a couple living in Nashville where the husband was offered a job in SF area for 350K total compensation. The husband was currently making something in the 150K range in Nashville, had a purchased home making 1k monthly mortgage payment and maxing out his retirement savings. He was comfortable and it seemed to be a good decision emotionally to stay and not take the job.

What I didn't understand with the responses was how the math was in his favor for staying? I'll try to do some of my own math to frame it, but that big of a salary bump seems to be objectively better if you aren't considering the emotional side to staying and the other non-financial benefits?

Just considering the potential salary in CA:

* Married Filing Jointly
* Gross: 350,000
* Taxes: 91,500 (Federal, State, Local)
* FICA, etc: 15,500
* Pre-Tax: 32,700 (insurance, maxed 401k, maxed family HSA)
* Net: **210,300** / **17,525 monthly**

The original poster also noted that they already have an emergency fund established, several thousand in trading options, and 10K cash for discretionary (?) spending

All that being said, if you're left with 17.5K a month **after** saving for retirement, what else is that money going towards? 

I understand that housing is expensive, but I don't think it would eat the entire net monthly income? I found plenty of very nice rentals for under 5K, even more for 6K.

If we take the maximum rent (6k) and then double it for all other various expenses (6K, which would be a lot of discretionary monthly, imo), we're still left with a surplus of 5,500 a month.

Obviously 66K a year surplus might not get you to a home purchase in a year or two, but maybe they are a lot more frugal on discretionary expenses or rent somewhere a lot less pricy than my expectation above. Maybe the other spouse finds work there too and they add a potential low six-figure salary on top of his, netting possibly an additional ~6.5K monthly?

They'd be maxed out on retirement, living comfortably, and potentially saving an additional 6-12K a month (possibly 150K annually) for a future house purchase, quicker retirement goals, nest egg to prepare for a move somewhere cheaper in 5-10 years, etc.

Someone please check my math, but on a financial level, I feel like it would make sense to make the move?

P.S. Here's the original post for context: [Rejecting a large job offer because my life is comfortable. Am I crazy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/us0991/rejecting_a_large_job_offer_because_my_life_is/)",finance,1653575893

&gt;Solar typically will give you a 14% to 17% return on your investment with a very low risk factor.The Banks are kind enough to give you a .01% return on your money. The Feds will give you a Tax credit that otherwise goes the Federal Black hole. I think its better for you to put your money to good use with Solar than to donate the same money to the power company and the Feds. I would be glad to give you a Solar quote. I just need a few measurements on your house.

$60k is a lot of money, but a return of 15%, come on this can't be true?

**Are we in a ""rally"" and is the ""bear market"" over?**

Financial reporters have been alternatively using the terms ""rally"" and ""bear market rally"" while analysts also claim that we're not near a market bottom yet. 

My personal take on the market this week is that there are sectors and names in the market that have bottomed and are gaining/regaining value while tech/growth stocks are continuing to sink. My most bullish view is that while tech/growth stocks may see a short bear market rally in June, and then resume falling, some of the rest of the market may be starting to bottom, particularly the value stocks/sectors and the high cashflow companies within all sectors. While the rest of the market may resume falling after a brief early Summer rally, stocks that are not tech/growth may never fall into bear territory and some may even rise out of correction territory. Overall, I think most of the sectors in the stock market are still giving the best results to stock pickers. 

There are far too many geopolitical moving parts &amp; unpredictable market forces ongoing as the pandemic economy unwinds, to predict whether a bottom is in (even for a subset of the market) or whether this is a ""rally"" or ""bear market rally"". Many of the unpredictable, independent factors have enough impact to move the dial at any time.

**My personal takes**

I personally feel that it's unproductive for me to focus wholly on broad market indexes. 

It seems clear that part of the market are in a definite bear market and have more to fall while some sectors of the market, like some industrial specialties, energy &amp; commodities, are in a long term bull cycle. 

Other sectors have been falling but seem to be finding some footing lately. 

For some people who have been able to avoid the overvalued stocks, this has not only not been a bear market, but not even a market in correction. Because of the footprint of the overvalued tech/growth/mega caps, the volatility of those stocks of course will drag down the entire market at times, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. 

This is a good time to talk about rotations. What is happening is that excess capital in some overvalued stocks are leaving those stocks/sectors and flowing into others. When that happens, that's called ""sector rotation"" if the money is leaving one sector and flowing into another, or ""rotation from growth to value"" as money leaves growth stocks that had been pumped up too much by low interest rates and flows into stocks that pay dividends and have good cashflow/fundamentals. If your eye is only on broad market indexes or one sector, you may be missing all the rotation-type action. 

Why are dividends the new favored stocks? When there's high inflation &amp; rising interest rates, real cash money in your hand today is worth more than the promise of future money that you will get a year, two years, or farther down the road. Dividend stocks pay you cash made by their businesses at regular intervals. Growth stocks, on the other hand, represent a promise of future money at some later time. The more inflation and/or interest rates rise, the more cash-money today is worth versus promises of future money that you'll see later on down the road. 

I feel think that it's still a stock picker's market and that there's an overall long term downtrend for the broad market indexes.   

There are a lot of risks and downsides in the market environment today &amp; none of this is advice that anyone who is not actively interested in following markets &amp; stocks should invest at this time.

Bitcoin,Fat Protocol Thesis 🧩,"If we think of Google, Amazon, Facebook, etcetera, as the applications of the internet, then we notice that the value accumulation is one-directional-----&gt;value flows from the base layer protocol (the internet) to its applications layer, thereby giving it tremendous value.

With bitcoin, we'll likely see value travel in the opposite direction, from the applications layer to the protocol layer (bitcoin).

https://preview.redd.it/ytzv2km0ku191.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c720c064ef7875b7eaf70e0c2a6c836a97f27602

In terms of crypto, the highest value use case for a coin or token is as **MONEY.**

Bitcoin is money. Stablecoins unfortunately are too. The problem there however, is that unlike bitcoin, stablecoins are a derivative of money (the USD). And the USD targets a stable price. In order to achieve this, you need central banks with complete authority and tools (debt, interest rates, printing, guns) to manipulate certain parts of the economy/world to achieve stability. It never works longterm. Bitcoin on the other hand doesn't target a stable price. It targets a variable price. It can control its ledger and issuance with the one-directional entropy of energy, and the free market decides the price. When it's absorbed enough trust (value), its confidence curve (volatility) will flatten. Nothing in the world will be able to compete with it. It's probably man's final money.

Stablecoins make up 85% of all altcoin protocol volume. This means nothing inside these altcoin protocols have established themselves as money except for stablecoins, and derivative versions of bitcoin (like the wrapped version).

If you take the Vitalik Buterin blockchain for example, its native token (starts with an E) is not money. It's a gas token required to ferry money and centralized dapp tokens around the blockchain. One of those forms of money it ferries around are stablecoins. And another form of money bitcoin (bitcoin, the wrapped version) is used to collateralize many dapps and structures. Both of these monies are hyper-centralized derivatives of the real version (USD and BTC).

My point is that the Vitalik Buterin chain suffers from a catastrophic flaw: its base layer is an IOU database, because ETH is not money, and is not the only thing that travels on its base layer. Tens of thousands of tokens do, and anyone that knows Solidity/Java can create one in &lt;30 minutes. How does *fat protocol thesis* work here? It doesn't. The model is invalid.

Take bitcoin though. It's a simple payment network. only bitcoin travels on that payment network. Above that is another layer. The Lighting Network ⚡️

The LN is not one thing. It's made up of several implementations (Core, LND, Eclair, etc) and they all work together by following what's called BOLT spec. The LND implementation of Lightning announced recently that they'll build support for stablecoins on and spec it. This is admittedly controversial to some, but is something I not just welcome but encourage. Remember, bitcoin is the base layer, and only bitcoin travels on that base layer. In fact, you can put anything on the LN: shitcoins, stablecoins, cbdc's, milk, sex, anything that has a MONEY value. I welcome all of it. The reason I do is because:

EVERYTHING GETS SETTLED IN BTC

And this is precisely how bitcoin will emerge as the ultimate collateral. Collateral is money. It'll be the asset that every other asset, product, and service is ultimately settled in and against, even if users don't know it or see it. That's where the USD peg and all fiat pegs for that matter disintegrate and flip, as the bitcoin's circular economy augments. The price of the bitcoin network then becomes quite obvious:

# ∞/21M

Absorbing the value of everything. The infinity symbol we maxi's use because new goods and services can always be added to the economy.

https://preview.redd.it/2n3o7rk0iu191.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=551cb07281d307700d7f667c325eac0aca2f6666

Bitcoin connects everything. The internet of money. That means that unlike Visa, Amex, PayPal, Western Union, Twilio, etcetera--which are all discrete networks that are not operable with one another, are permissioned, regulated, and connected to banks--everyone will use the same network, the Lightning Network. The LN is what unleashes the unit-of-account or *medium of exchange* part of bitcoin's collateral by scaling it to light speed, instant settlement, and near zero cost to the world. Most of the new 1B users won't know they're even using the network anymore than they do HTTP when web browsing, it'll just disappear into the internet stack. And like I learned in El Salvador amongst the locals, that unit-of-account which we call sats, will just be called bitcoin. 1000 sats will be 1000 bitcoin, whole coins won't be a thing, which is the power of an asset repricing itself.

I'll use $ in the example below because that's the base layer everything is settled in currently:

All Alice knows is she just sent $25 in value with a click from her Chase app, and seconds later Bob receives a notification that his Muun wallet received $25, then hands the strawberries from the farm stand to Alice. Bob waves goodbye, and with the app still open, he sends the $25 to his father in Zimbabwe to pay his phone bill which his father uses for an OnlyFans membership, which the performer uses to pay her Netflix, which pools it with other money to pay the kid in India in a small village with computer skills they hired remotely to code the color grading API for their editing studio in Brooklyn. All that's required for anybody in the world to get started is a free mobile app. Tap a button and you're banked.

So all the value moving ABOVE the base layer ultimately gets settled on the base layer, MONEY, which is also deflationary like the internet at large. The internet for example, shoehorned entertainment, libraries, universities, and the whole of known human history into small hard drives and servers, creating an overabundance of information. The internet of money will create an overabundance of goods and services OUTSIDE the money. One reason is because in the digital realm, the technology surrounding bitcoin will always trend towards its cost of production as information--which is close to zero. And partly because the part of the network tethered to the physical world (PoW) will create an overabundance of energy which will drive the cost of many assets to their utility value.

I think this is how *fat protocol thesis* will play out for bitcoin. 🤷‍♂️",cryptocurrency,1653583768

personalfinance,"Down Payment Assistance Program: Should I bite? Any advice is greatly appreciated! Rent or buy a condo w/ ""DALP"" in HCOL City? &amp; so many other questions... please and thanks","*Please lend me a hand if you can spare the time!*

I'll try to be concise:

I've been given the opportunity to buy a condo in San Francisco via the city-funded down payment assistance program, but I have so many conflicting thoughts and admittedly don't understand real estate &amp; finance well enough... (I grew up in poverty)

**Down Payment Assistance**:

* The city contributes \~$350,000 toward the down payment; no interest, no monthly fees for 30 years. Then the entire amount is due (or I can refinance) (refinancing is allowed only through the city's list of approved lenders)
* (And a separate lender provides another \~$450k mortgage, and I provide a down payment of \~$50k)
* *Not permitted to rent out the property. (But I believe I can after I repay the full amount?)*
* There is a 60 day closing period in order (because we're dealing with the government), which is unattractive to sellers. This forces me to try to have the highest offer as an incentive...
* *Appreciation is split proportionally with the city, based on assistance amount : value of home. (If the condo is APPRAISED at $700,000, then I would owe 50% of any appreciation @ time of sale. \[350/700 = 50%\])*
* The city will NOT help pad the losses if the property depreciates.
* Property must be in San Francisco
* No prepayment penalty (but must be paid in full. I don't imagine refinancing is allowed as a source of prepayment?)

**Example possible scenario:**

* Condo purchase price: $850,000.
   * My takehome pay (after taxes): \~$6250
   * Down payment assistance: $350,000... Personal down payment: $70,000
   * Monthly condo payment: \~$3900
      * Principal &amp; Interest: \~$2250
      * HOA \~$600 (No amenities included in the building)
      * Homeowner's Insurance: $150
      * Property tax: \~$900
   * If I were to rent a unit of similar quality, it would cost me around $3000-4000/month.

**A bit about me:**

* I'm almost 30. Single. I'm happy to live here for another... at least 5 years? I don't see myself having kids that soon, although it's certainly possible... job is relatively secure... I'm not too picky with where I live; (I'm happy with either a quiet &amp; scenic location or a lively &amp; bustling &amp; slightly more dangerous location. Only requirement I have is a parking spot; I'd prefer to live somewhat close to work. &lt; \~20minute drive. I think I prefer a more modern interior though - e.g. hardwood floors) I've lived in a quiet part of town for the past \~5 years, and I'd say 60% of me would be happy mixing it up and living in the heart of town where it's bustling with people. 40% of me would be happy keeping things low key as it is.

**Concerns:**

**1)** No doubt it would be a better financial decision to rent and invest my out of pocket costs... but... ugh ***what would you do in my shoes and why?***

* **Pros:** Build some equity? Slightly nicer unit / quality of life compared to renting? Own property that I wouldn't be otherwise able to afford for many years.
* **Cons:** The market seems to be hurting: interest rates &amp; supply of condos on market are climbing and condo values are dropping (condo is probably a bad investment right now &amp; probably won't be in the green for many years?), I most likely could invest the \~100k out of pocket costs, can't rent unit so I'd be forced to sell if I want to move, purchase price will most likely be quite a bit higher than the appraisal price (so **the** **% of any appreciation that I'll owe back to the city is skewed against my favor**), costly HOA with (likely) no amenities, etc.

**2) What would you recommend and why? (San Francisco)**

1. Quiet and scenic location, nicer unit (either larger or nicer, more modern build quality, nicer view &amp; natural light) for the price, more street parking (e.g. for guests), safer. But poor access to public transportation, not much within walking distance (must drive 5 minutes to get to nearby action, and possibly another 5-10 minutes to find parking). (Twin Peaks, Outer Richmond, Outer Sunset, East SOMA / East Cut, etc.)
2. Lively neighborhood, close to public transportation (lightrail and bus stops), restaurants and shops within walking distance. But worse unit (either smaller or older build quality and bad views and natural lighting), very difficult street parking (e.g. for guests), dirtier, louder, and more dangerous neighborhood (Mission District, Fillmore District, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Also, if I decide to buy:** ***(you can ignore most these questions if you'd like, I'll make separate searches for these)***

* How do I ""vet"" &amp; inspect a condo?
* What should I look out for in the disclosures? What section do I look for potential special assessments / future maintenance / and recent inspection reports of the entire building?
* **What's the most amount of time you'd be willing to spend to:**
   * Drive/commute to work?
   * Walk to nearby coffee shops, restaurants, and parks?
   * Walk/drive to grocery stores?
   * etc.
* Do you think living in a neighborhood where visitors will have trouble finding street parking is a big problem?
* What are your personal top priorities in your property &amp; area of residence?
   * *Property*:  e.g. size? ceiling height? parking? in unit washer and dryer? modern amenities? etc.
   * *Area*: e.g. proximity to stores, restaurants, parks, nightlife, more distant vacation spots..? Safety... street parking availability... etc.
* What are some things a first time home/condo buyer should be aware of that I might not know?
   * (Costs of utilities?) (How much do you set aside for potential maintenance? Furniture and renovations? etc.)
* Any miscellaneous tips and pointers? I'd probably find anything helpful.

2. If/when they go down, I can refinance again to a fixed rate and just use the lower variable rate to bridge the gap.

personalfinance,do I refinance before paying off an auto loan with a high interest rate?,"I need a new car as my current one unexpectedly died. I had a $6,100 payoff amount with a high interest rate of 9.88% (I know, I was young and had zero credit history).

I want to sell my car for parts and I have a buyer willing to pay $5000. I need to pay off my loan first and get the title to be able to sign it over to him. 

I have been thinking a lot about refinancing my loan since I had such a high interest rate and did get a PenFed rate of 4.39% to refinance.

I don’t know why I didn’t think of this earlier, but does that even make sense to refinance right before paying it off? I don’t know why I was under the assumption I would be paying *less* of a pay off amount but I’m now realizing they’re going to cover the pay off amount and i’ll have to pay interest on THAT. Right?

My plan was to refinance and get a cheaper pay off amount, but that wouldn’t make any sense correct? The payoff amount would be the total payoff amount for my first auto loan PLUS the new interest charges from PenFed? I don’t know why I was assuming that the payoff amount would be less if I’m borrowing the full payoff amount in the first place. 

So in that case would it just benefit me best to pay off the $6100 now ( I am able to borrow from a family member) and not even worry about refinancing? The loan is 40% paid off and has 40 months left. The new refinanced loan is 36 months. 

I also need a new car so was going to try and get approved for an auto loan with PenFed as well for a NEW auto loan for the new car I will need on top of that. Is it best then to pay off my high interest loan with cash NOW, pay back my family member on their own terms on my own time, and then open a new auto loan with penfed for my new car? no refinancing needed?

thanks for the help, I just can’t believe I didn’t think of this 🤦🏻‍♀️",finance,1653594476
personalfinance,Paying off auto loan early vs. investing money into the market,"I've got a situation where I am wanting to accelerate paying off my auto loan more aggressively by adding extra principal to each monthly payment.

Loan rate is: 2.99%

Given what I think I know and what I've read, it may be smarter to invest the extra principal into the market rather than pay it towards a low-interest rate loan and then use the capital + gains - taxes to pay off the loan at my desired time.

Looking for thoughts on low to moderate risk ETFs to put the funds into that can yield &gt; 2.99% over the next 12-15 months.  I understand the market as of late is down and can continue to trend that way given inflation and that my investments aren't guaranteed.

Thanks in advance.",finance,1653598109

bonds,"Turning in paper bonds, specifically EE bonds","I tried to look up some info on this and could just find some intermediate info on this board.  So I figured I would give this info and when it all completed will do another with the full info.

Main Treasury web site: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res\_e\_bonds\_eeredeem.htm](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeredeem.htm)

I had a nice stack of EE paper bonds that had reached full maturity and went to redeem them.  Unfortunately, the banks I had accounts with no longer handled them and after walking into two others one said they would but only if I had accounts with them for greater than six months.

To mail them in you need the  FS Form 1522 , web site above, filled out and then witnessed by a certifying official or a notary.   I had brought the paperwork with me and my main bank did this for free.

To mail them in I used USPS, with full tracking and insurance for the present value of the bonds.  I first went to fedex and the insurance they offer is for value of materials shipped which would just be the paper not the value of the bonds.

Before mailing I made copies of all bonds.

Mailed and two days later I got email with the full receipt of it being delivered.

Then 20 days later I got an automated message from Treasury that they had received my bonds and that they would be worked in the order received.  I was given a case number, customer number, and instructions on how to contact.

Instructions also said that it would take up to 16 weeks for them to be processed.  So will update then.",finance,1653601580

personalfinance,Carrying a balance on my CC when inflation rates are high,"Hey all,

So I've always paid off the balance on my credit card in full each month, but recently I've become a little tight on cash. I still have the funds to pay off my full balance, but I remembered something YouTuber Graham Stephen said about his mortgages. It was something along the lines that with interest rates so low and inflation so high, he had no intention of paying those debts off early as it was basically free money.

I was thinking of maybe starting to carry a balance on my CC since my APR is 1.99% and inflation is in the mid 8's. But then I was thinking that unless my income increased more than 1.99% I wouldn't really be doing myself any favors. 

Aside from the obvious impact to my credit score from utilizing higher debt, would carrying a balance be a good idea? Is there a reason why this strategy works for him but doesn't seem to work for me? 

Possible things I'm thinking of are:

1) that his income is increasing whereas mine is more or less set for the next year

2) It has something to do with the difference between revolving vs installment debt

3) He's full of it and it's not a good strategy for him or anyone else",finance,1653603691

If we export oil on the daily to countries like Canada &amp; Mexico (amongst many others), why do we also import oil on the daily from those same countries??

I've been reading numerous articles on how the Biden administration isn't ruling out oil export bans in order to curb prices at the pump. Apparently we consume 20m barrels per day of our own oil, and export 8.6m per day of our own oil (so exports &gt;25%). 

I understand we want to support countries and Europe and elsewhere who are more reliant on Russia at this time. The concept of an oil export ban seems controversial, and we don't need to get into that. Just focus on the topic at hand...

If we export oil to a country, just to turn around an import oil, what's the point!? Should I view this as something similar to Federal Funds and overnight lending? Where each country is just trying to ensure they have sufficient oil stores each day? Or is this a profit grab?",finance,1653613466

I recently became a client of Facet Wealth (personal finance advisor firm) and as part of their package they offered us free tax preparation services. I decided to take advantage of that but now I am wishing I had not. 

Turns out they got my account number wrong and this has caused many problems. I owed 10k in federal taxes which could not be withdrawn from the wrong account they entered, so I paid that money separately on IRS DirectPay. (facet called and instructed me that his had happened) For CA Tax however, the FTB owed me 7.5K. That money also went to the same wrong account and I realized only on May18th.  I got in touch with Facet immediately and they told me they would work on it. 

They have now confirmed to me (only via phone) that the refund will take place but it will take 4 months and they offered the option (again only over the phone) of a bridge loan where basically they pay me the money until the FTB sends me the refund. 

However, over the past ten days I could barely get them to respond over email and I am not easily able to reach any of them over the phone and they are very sporadic about replying.

What should be my next steps here? Registering my own complaint with the FTB? I want to be sure I am not missing something since as of now I don't think its anything malicious on their end but at the same time I have no faith in them anymore.",finance,1653617566

Bitcoin,Why should I invest in bitcoin?,"I have a question that has been bothering me for some time - and I'm sure bitcoin experts can help me out. 

I have the following assumptions: 

1. blockchain as a technology will establish itself in the financial world in the long run, as the elimination of intermediaries can increase overall welfare. 
2. this will lead to the coexistence of cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies.
3. at the same time, new possibilities arise regarding the custody and trading of securities. 

Now - let's look at the long-term positioning of Bitcoin. There are probably two scenarios: 

1. **Bitcoin establishes itself as a means of payment.**   
For this scenario to occur, Bitcoin's value must level off and volatility must be reduced. Where this value lies cannot be predicted. At the same time, it is also not clear whether Bitcoin will prevail as the cryptocurrency in this scenario - or whether it will be one cryptocurrency, or whether several cryptocurrencies will establish themselves. This scenario would also have a strong impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy. At the same time, it would mean that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are no longer suitable as an investment from that point on. 
2. **Bitcoin establishes itself as an investment.**  
In this scenario, Bitcoin would be considered like gold or shares. One can assume that either way, the use of blockchains will also revolutionise the trading of traditional investments. In my view, this would mean that the two main advantages of Bitcoin as an investment would disappear: high liquidity and independence from financial intermediaries. If these advantages disappear, only scarcity remains as an argument why Bitcoin should establish itself as an investment. But if we realise that Bitcoin does not work as a means of payment, scarcity also loses importance.

stocks,"Summer rally ‘bandwagon’ is growing, say BofA strategists, may represent a ""tradable bounce""","In previous posts this week, I described how there is a generally a brief summer rally that can start at any time if seasonal market patterns hold this year. (Now whether there is a Summer rally this year, and/or it turns out to be a bear market rally or brief bounce, depends on a lot of geopolitical &amp; supply chain issues that are random factors at this point). 

There have been three catalysts for bulls' attempt to find footing this week as the market consolidates at just above the level at which the S&amp;P would enter a bear market: 

* Biden suggesting early this week that the (inflationary) tariffs regime may be lifted,   
* the release of the Fed meeting minutes Wednesday that confirmed no rate hikes &gt; 1/2% are being considered, and   
* strong earnings reports in the past 2 days from some retailers after an initially depressing set of earnings reports from Walmart &amp; Target sent markets tumbling and a good April report of inflation-adjusted consumer spending has eased near-term recession fears   
* today it was reported that inflation appears to have slowed to around 6.3% in April  

It's important to note here that the week long rally I'm describing has been selective. In US equities, industrial stocks, pharmaceuticals, materials and other real economy sectors have had a run of 5 days of gains in a row. Tech/growth stocks may pause in their correction and catch a lift from the consolidation in these other sectors, or they may not. But there has also appeared a new bout of so-called ""dip buying"" that appears to be favoring global assets, including foreign stocks &amp; bonds after analysts cut ratings on ""developed markets"" as the EU &amp; emerging markets have developed into deep value plays since being dragged into the US selloff. 

With that context, 

[**Dip Buyers Storm Back to Stocks After Selloff** Investors add about $20 billion to global equity funds in week; Summer rally ‘bandwagon’ is growing, say BofA strategists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-27/stock-funds-see-biggest-inflows-in-10-weeks-as-dip-buyers-return)

&gt; Global equity funds saw their biggest inflows in 10 weeks, led by US stocks, as cheaper valuations lured buyers after a steep selloff on recession fears.

&gt; Investors added about $20 billion to global stocks in the week to May 25, led by inflows into the US, according to Bank of America Corp.’s note citing EPFR Global data. Cash led the inflows among asset classes with about $28 billion, signaling market participants continue to search for havens. Bond fund outflows reached $5.8 billion. 

&gt; Equities have staged a recovery this week, with the US and European indexes heading for their biggest weekly advance since mid-March as investors bought the dip after strong declines. Citigroup Inc. strategists this week recommended stepping back into stocks, particularly in Europe and emerging markets, on their appealing valuations, while cutting their recommendation on US stocks to neutral

&gt; Still, strategists remain divided on whether the selloff has found a bottom, with the likes of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America saying that there may be more losses to come, while BlackRock cut developed market stocks to neutral this week. 

&gt; “Summer rally bandwagon is growing,” Bank of America strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in the note. “We fade rallies, but not in a rush.” 

&gt; Assets including US 30-year Treasuries, Chinese and German stocks, US banks and technology, European industrials as well as consumer stocks in the US, Europe and China are among the most oversold assets relative to their 200-day moving average and “vulnerable to tradable bounce,” the strategists said.

vet,Needing Advice - Trying to convince mother to euthanize her dog,"Throwaway account, as I hopefully can forget this once I receive the advice I need.

Hello, I am seeking advice for my mother's elderly dog. He is a 15-ish-year-old Chihuahua mix, who was inherited by my mom after my grandmother passed away. The dog was pretty healthy at the time of being adopted by my mom, about four years ago, but he has recently begun to have quality of life issues.

The dog's background is unclear, as he was adopted from a shelter fourteen years ago, and the adoption papers from my grandmother have been lost since her death. All we know is the dog is around fifteen years old, is a chihuahua mix (we're unsure what breeds he is a mix of, but he is predominantly chihuahua as confirmed by a vet), and is beginning to suffer.

In the past few months, he went from a senior dog doing relatively well to struggling. Below is a list of problems and behaviors exhibited in the past few months:

* An increase in aggression. He will snap at you if you touch him wrong, even if his body language appears to not be averse to touch.
* He has a decreased appetite and thirst. He still eats and drinks, but not very frequently.
* He has shown a decline in cognition, not following daily routines, producing waste in the house, sleeping for longer periods of time than normal, and is generally confused.
* He often hides under the bed, refusing to come out. He does this in the absence of stressful stimuli.
* He has difficulty moving as he has before, sometimes not being able to jump onto the bed or run as much as he used to when outside in our fenced yard.

These behaviors are a recent development. Most of these have been completely absent 8-10 months from today. It doesn't seem to be getting better, either. Most of them have developed 5-6 months ago, and have been increasingly becoming a problem in everyday life, to the point where I've discussed with my mom about euthanasia in the past few weeks.

I didn't mention this before, but I am legally a minor. I'm seventeen, and I legally am not responsible for this dog. It has always been listed as my mom's dog ever since being adopted from my deceased grandmother. There's nothing in my power as a minor I can do regarding this dog's health. If this was the case, I would've taken action. All I have the ability to do is persuade my mom, hoping she takes it seriously.

My mom is aware of her dog's struggles but claims that she doesn't feel that putting him to sleep would be the right decision. Her reasoning is that the dog is the 'last thing of \[grandma\]'s' and she wants to keep him alive until he dies naturally. I view this to be cruel, as I do not believe that her reasoning justifies keeping him alive.

I believe that she is slowly becoming convinced of euthanasia, but still believes that passing away naturally is what my grandmother would have wanted. I argued that grandmother would've preferred if he was put to sleep surrounded by me and my mother than in an unpredictable way. I proposed that the dog would be happy if we fed him some food he's never been able to eat before we put him down, like fast food.

My mom is planning on taking him to the vet soon (she is yet to schedule an appointment, but she said she would a couple of days ago. She is away from home for a few days so I expect when she comes home she will), and perhaps from there, we can arrive to a more conclusive solution. My mom doesn't want to pay too high of a medical bill for the dog (think surgery) since he is already quite old, so I really don't think she has a reason to keep him alive.

Again, I have no control over this situation as I am a minor and am not the legal owner of the dog. I wish not to be blamed for any of this, as I would have solved this problem if I had the power to. I love animals, and I want them to be happy and healthy, which is the reason I was considering euthanasia in the first place. I feel bad sitting idly by while my mother's dog's health declines.

Any advice would be appreciated. If you feel as though euthanasia is not the answer, I will gladly listen. All I want is for any advice in this scenario, as I feel powerless.

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, warned this week that the Federal Reserve's move to increase interest rates to offset record inflation may trigger a recession.

""The Fed's hawkish pivot has raised the risk that markets see rates staying in restrictive territory,"" BlackRock said in a research note. ""The year-to-date selloff partly reflects this, yet we see no clear catalyst for a rebound. If they hike interest rates too much, they risk triggering a recession. If they tighten not enough, the risk becomes runaway inflation. It's tough to see a perfect outcome.""

stocks,The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge rose 4.9% in April in a sign that price increases could be slowing,"The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose 4.9% in April from a year ago, a still-elevated level that nonetheless indicated that price pressures could be easing a bit, the Commerce Department reported Friday. That increase in the core personal consumption expenditures price index was in line with expectations and reflected a slowing pace from the 5.2% reported in March. The number excludes volatile food and energy prices that have been a major contributor to inflation running around a 40-year peak. The 0.3% increase on a monthly basis was the same as March and in line with Dow Jones estimates. Including food and energy, headline PCE increased 6.3% in April from a year ago. That also was a deceleration from the 6.6% pace in the previous month. However, the monthly change showed a more marked pullback, with an increase of just 0.2% compared with the 0.9% surge in March.

The data showed that consumers continued to spend but were tapping into their savings to do so. “Consumers remained undaunted by inflation last month, strongly increasing spending and changing their mix to more services such as at bars and restaurants, and travel and recreation as the weather warms,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “The spending was fueled in part by higher wages, and also by Americans drawing more money out of savings, which is a giant stockpile of at least $2 trillion.” Inflation for the past several months has been moving at a pace not seen since the early 1980s. The inability of supply to keep up with demand has pushed prices higher, fed by unprecedented fiscal stimulus during the Covid pandemic, clogged global supply chains and the war in Ukraine that has sent energy prices soaring and led to fears of food shortages. Responding to the price pressures, the Fed has implemented two interest rate increases totaling 75 basis points and has indicated that a series of hikes are likely ahead until inflation comes closer to the central bank’s 2% goal.

&gt; “I think the 325,000 consensus [nonfarm payrolls] number, we could easily beat. But it’s just math,” said Alex Chaloff, co-head of investment strategies at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. He noted there could be positive revisions in prior month’s data, as there have been in recent reports.
*****
&gt; Economists have expected the pace of job creation to slow from 428,000 jobs in April. “You can’t continue to grow at that type of pace, especially with Covid spiking. That’s a little bit of air cover for the 325,000 number,” said Chaloff.
*****
&gt; # A recovery after the Fed’s minutes
Stocks in the past week were choppy but moved sharply higher, especially after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its last meeting.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 6.5% to 4,158, the best week since November, 2020. The Dow was up 6.2%, while the Nasdaq was the outperformer, up 6.8%.
*****
&gt; “It was waiting for some sort of a catalyst, and I think it got it from the Fed. Not only was it not more hawkish, but it said it would look to expedite the rate tightening,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; “So I think a lot of investors thought they were frontloading the rate hiking cycle, implying they could end up pausing in the third quarter sometime,” he added. “I think that’s what was the rally trigger. The market just got oversold on a breadth and sentiment perspective and was ripe for some sort of good news and the Fed delivered.”
*****
&gt; Chaloff said the market is expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 50 basis points, or a half percentage point, at each of its next two meetings. That could mean choppy trading through that period, but he added the first time the Fed returns to a quarter-point pace of hiking, the market should rally hard.
*****
&gt; “I think this is the early stage of a bounce but we have a Fed meeting in June. We have a Fed meeting in July,” he said. “It will have an impact on markets. It will have jitters when the Fed is acknowledging they have work to do. We’re not saying this is the floor... But it’s great to see markets reacting appropriately to solid macro data.”
*****
&gt; For now though, stocks could head higher. “I would say it hasn’t been a really crazy volume week, so it’s nice, it’s fun, it’s great to go into the long weekend, starting the summer with some strength, but the breadth and depth hasn’t been there,” Chaloff said. “I want to say ‘Okay, everybody, we’re not dancing. We’re not there yet’ … We think we’re through the worst of it, but not all of it.”
*****
&gt; # Looking for catalysts
Chaloff said he will be watching to see if hedge funds, which had been unloading holdings, start to buy in the coming week, a possible positive catalyst for the market.
*****
&gt; “These kinds of weeks like this help build on themselves, so while it’s not a breakthrough week, it’s an important week,” he said.
*****
&gt; Any developments over the weekend could be important, but weekends are also a time when investors reflect. “If you have a really bad week, and people can’t touch their money for 48 or 72 hours, you really have a bad open to start the week,” Chaloff said.
*****
&gt; Bond yields in the past week were lower and steadier. The 10-year yield was at about 2.74% Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s positive for stocks and obviously bonds,” Chaloff said. “After seven, eight weeks of outflows you’re starting to get inflows into fixed income instruments of all types, and that keeps yields constrained.”
*****
&gt; That is also a positive for growth companies that were the hardest hit as interest rates rose.
*****
&gt; Markets close out the month of May on Tuesday. As of Friday, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were both flattish for the month but negative for the Nasdaq.
*****
&gt; Stovall said June is usually positive for the S&amp;P 500. “June has typically few swoons. It’s sort of middling in terms of performance,” he said.

&gt; # It's Over

&gt; Spring is meant to be a season of growth, but that's the last way to describe what's been going on in financial markets for the last several weeks. The S&amp;P 500 came into April with a three-week winning streak on Friday, April 1st, but in what has been one of the cruelest April Fools pranks we've ever seen, the S&amp;P 500 was down for seven straight weeks in what was the longest weekly losing streak since March 2001. For the DJIA, the streak was even more extreme with eight straight weekly declines for the longest run of consecutive declines in 99 years. 99 years is a long time.

&gt; As shown in the chart below, the streak that ended this week was one of just three other periods where the S&amp;P 500 was down for seven or more straight weeks. The other three were in May 1970 (8 weeks), March 1980 (7 weeks), and March 2001 (8 weeks). Besides relentless selling over several weeks, the other factor these three periods have in common is that they all occurred during recessions. May 1970 was right in the middle of a recession, March 1980 was two months into the first of the 'double-dip' recessions in the early 1980s, and March 2001 came just as the economy was starting to roll over from the dot-bomb fueled contraction. Economists have assured anyone who will listen that the economy isn't close to a recession yet, but then again, in Q1 the economy contracted by 1.5%, and the latest projection from the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model currently has a forecast of just 1.9% growth for Q2.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052722-Weekly-Losing-Streaks.png))**

&gt; As an investor, whether we're in a recession or not at this point is almost irrelevant. Equities have already fallen sharply. The more important question is where the economy is going. Anyone who has that kind of crystal ball has a distinct advantage. Think about it. When a recession begins, no one watching just the economy ever knows what is about to unfold. They may be thought of as periods of economic weakness and high unemployment, but the start of a recession also coincides with the point at which the economy is at its strongest and firing on all cylinders. The last thing on anyone's mind at that point is a recession.

&gt; In terms of the prior streaks where the S&amp;P 500 declined for seven or more weeks in a row, forward performance was mixed but generally positive. Three is admittedly a small sample size, but one, three, six, and twelve months later, the S&amp;P 500 was higher at least two out of three times, and three months later (13 weeks) it was higher all three times. 2022 has been a lousy year so far. Wouldn't it be nice, though, if six months from now at Thanksgiving, instead of everyone worrying about a new emerging strain of COVID (like we did last year), we were all thankful that stocks and bonds stabilized and maybe, just maybe, even partly dug themselves out of the hole they've already put themselves into?

&gt; The week after Memorial Day performed quite well 1971-95. DJIA &amp; S&amp;P up 68% of the time, averaging 0.8% – DJIA up 12 in a row 1984-95. NAS was up 72% of times, average 0.6%, up 10 straight 1986-95. Since 1979 R2K was up 88% of times, average 0.9%, up 13 straight 1983-95.

&gt; Starting in 1996 the week after Memorial Day performance diminished. DJIA was up only 42% of times, average 0.02%, down 8 of last 12. S&amp;P, NAS &amp; R2K all gained ground less than 60% of the time, down 6 of last 12. Huge gains this week in 2000 skew the averages.

&gt; 2022 Stock Trader’s Almanac page 100 tracks behavior before &amp; after holidays since 1980. Days after Memorial Day show positivity. But weakness increased the last 21-years the 3 days after Memorial Day. Day after Memorial Day DJIA &amp; NAS down 5 of last 7, S&amp;P down 6 of last 7.

&gt; DJIA is on pace to snap its 8-week losing streak. S&amp;P and NASDAQ are set to end their 7-week losing streaks. But all three are already up over 4% from their May lows in just a few days. Russell 2000 has rallied 7% from its 5/11 low.

&gt; June’s bullish tendency during the first couple days is visible in the “June Almanac” on page 58 of the 2022 Stock Trader’s Almanac. But this bear market rally could pause next week as stocks flirt with resistance levels today at DJIA 33000, S&amp;P 4100 &amp; NAS 12000.

&gt; # Bulls Back Below 20%

&gt; In spite of the S&amp;P 500 actually reversing course and heading higher in the past week, sentiment on the part of individual investors surveyed by the American Association of Individual Investors has turned lower, once again falling below 20%. That is the first sub-20% reading since the last week of April, although the multiple readings in the mid-teens last month were lower than this week's reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052622-Bulls-1.png))**

&gt; The past several months as the major indices have entered downtrends have seen an impressive collapse in optimism. Over the past six months, slightly more than half of the time less than a quarter of AAII respondents have reported as bullish. Going back through the history of the survey beginning in the late 1980s, there have only been two other periods with this same sort of consistently pessimistic attitude for an extended period of time: late 1988 to early 1989 and two years later in early 1991.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052622-Bull-Streaks.png))**

&gt; Given bulls were hard to find, bearish sentiment ticked up to 53.5%. Although over half of respondents are expecting lower stock prices, that is still not as high of a reading as the end of April when it was nearly 60%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052622-Bears.png))**

&gt; Regardless, bears continue to heavily outweigh bulls as the bull-bear spread has now sat in negative territory for all but two weeks over the past half-year.

&gt; The bearish camp did not pick up all of the losses in bullish sentiment. Neutral sentiment rose back up to 26.7% this week marking the highest reading in a month. That being said, the reading remains below the historical average of 31.43%. Click here to learn more about Bespoke's premium stock market research service.

&gt; # One Of The Worst Starts Ever After 100 Days, But There Is Hope

&gt; Yesterday was the 100th trading day of the year for 2022 and although stocks managed to gain about 1%, it was still the worst start to a year since 1970 for the S&amp;P 500 Index.

&gt; In fact, it is the fourth worst start to a year ever after 100 days, with only 1932 (Great Depression), 1940 (World War II), and 1970 (Vietnam and a recession) worse.

&gt; There is actually some good news in there though, as we’ve usually seen the previous worst starts ever come back nicely—sometimes in record fashion. “Down 16.5% after 100 days for the S&amp;P 500 is the worst start to a year since 1970 and one of the worst starts ever,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But the good news is previous bad starts have seen some nice rubber band snap backs and 2022 could be in line to do it once again.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous five worst starts to a year ever saw the remainder of the year higher every single time, up 19.1% on average compared with the average rest of the year gain of 5.0%. 2022 has been very tough, but most investors would likely take a 19% bounce the rest of the year.

&gt; # What Happens After A Bear Market Starts? Four Things To Know

&gt; “Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.” – Albert Einstein

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was down more than 20% on an intraday basis on Friday, but managed a huge rally late to avoid closing down 20% and moving into an official bear market. With the S&amp;P 500 down 18.7% though (as of Friday’s close) a bear market is still quite possible.

&gt; Here are four things to know should stocks go into a bear market.

&gt; One popular question has been what happens after stocks go into a bear market? “As rough as bear markets are, the good news is the future returns really improve once stocks are down 20%,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, a median gain of nearly 24% a year after a bear market starts may help some beaten-down bulls confidently stay the course.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-1.png))**

&gt; One more look at the table above shows that only three times were stocks lower a year later and all were associated with major recessions. We do not see a recession on the horizon, which could be a clue returns could be strong going out a year.

&gt; What about how quickly after a bear market starts do stocks finally stop going down? This one has something for everyone, as the least ever was only 1 day in 1957, while it took 19 months for the bleeding to stop in the early 2000s. Once again though, if the bear happened around a recession, the weakness usually continued much longer and vice versa. 1962, 1966, and 1987 all recovered quickly and didn’t happen in a recession. Meanwhile, stocks did manage to bottom quickly during the recessions of 1957 and 2020. While the recessions of 1974, the early 1980s, dot com burst, and the financial crisis all saw the damage continue for much longer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-2.png))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it took about 19 months on average for stocks to recover their bear market losses. The good news is the past three bear markets recouped losses in 5, 4, and 4 months. Additionally, if the bear market was worse, it took longer to recover. This was not very surprising, but when the bear market decline was less than 22%, it took only seven months on average to make up the losses versus 27 months if the bear was worse than -22%. Should this bear market end soon (our base case), it could bode well for a quicker recovery once again.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-3-1.png))**

&gt; Lastly, there have been a lot of bear markets over time, but one thing that has always happened is stocks have eventually come back to new highs. We do not know when this one will, but we don’t expect this incredible streak to end now.

&gt; Investors with longer-term horizons should use this weakness as an opportunity, or Einstein said in the above quote, we’ve got to keep our balance and move forward.

&gt; # Breaking ""the Mondays""

&gt; We've talked a lot in the past about how the overwhelming majority of the equity market's gains in the last several decades have come outside of regular trading hours. When you consider the fact that active trading in US equity markets is less than 20% of all the time in a given week, it would make sense that most news occurs outside of trading hours. Therefore, when good news breaks outside of trading hours, stocks typically gap higher in response, and when there's bad news, they gap lower at the next open.

&gt; So far, 2022 has generally been a case of the latter. With issues like rising prices, tighter monetary and fiscal policy, and the war in Europe, there really hasn't been much in the way of good news for investors to digest over the weekends, and therefore, when markets do start a new week of trading, performance has been anemic at best. Three charts illustrate this trend.

&gt; This morning the S&amp;P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) gapped up 0.80% which was the largest upside gap in SPY to kick off a new trading week since late November. Today's strong open also broke a streak of 20 straight weeks where SPY's opening gap to kick off a week was negative or a gain of less than 0.30%. The chart below shows historical streaks where SPY's opening gap on the first trading day of the week was negative or below 0.30%. The streak that just ended was the third-longest in SPY's history, behind the 30-week streak ending August 2005 and the 22-week streak in June 2006. Both of those streaks came in the middle of the Fed's early 2000s rate hike cycle where it raised rates by 25 bps for 17 straight meetings spanning June 2004 through June 2006 and took the Fed Funds Rate from 1.0% to 5.25% in the process.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052322-Streaks1.png))**

&gt; Not only has there been a general lack of significant upside pressure to markets to kick off the trading week lately, but the trend has actually been in the opposite direction. Heading into today, SPY gapped lower to kick off the trading week 15 times in the last 19 weeks, and over the last six months, there were only 17 weeks where SPY gapped higher to kick off a week. In the entire history of SPY since the early 1990s, there have only been five other periods where there was a higher frequency of downside gaps to kick off a trading week in a six-month span, and they all peaked at 18.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052322-Negative-Gaps.png))**

&gt; Lastly, with the S&amp;P 500 consistently opening lower to kick off the week, it would only make sense that the six-month average opening gap of the trading week would also be negative, and that's exactly what we have seen. Over the last six months (26-weeks), SPY's average opening gap to kick off a trading week has been a decline of 0.28% which is the weakest reading since the COVID crash (when there was a lot of bad news) and before that, the only two other weaker periods were in the six months ending in July 2009 and February 2002. If you were involved in the market in either of those periods, you remember that there was not a lot to be optimistic about in either period...sort of like now. They call it ""the Mondays"" for a reason, and lately, equities have had a bad case of them.

Would ideally be planning on keeping them in there for at least 5 years if they continue to offer decent returns. Thinking about maybe doing half of the Roth IRA contribution cap in I Bonds and half in other if I can cobble enough together this year.

If you think this is a bad idea what would you suggest to buy in a Roth IRA this year that will definitely be in the green by over 9.62% in another year? Little makes sense to buy until more is known about Fed rate hike capitulation timeline IMO.

Also now with the Fed raising rates does that mean that the presently 0% base rate on the I Bonds will be going up after October? If so might be better to wait until after October to buy long term I Bonds in Roth IRA and buy ones I plan to hold less than 5 years outside of Roth IRA in the meantime?

IE- as an example if the market is going into a recession and you keep buying the dip- and crypto drops another 30% next week, would you really want to have bought the dip before the dip?

I personally took out all my holding a couple week ago before it got as bad as it has been for the last week or two or so.  

From what I've seen it seems like until the fed takes their finger off interest rates it's basically a risk off environment so I ain't touching shit in it personally till the market starts to capitulate. 

Anyway, TL;DR- people that repeate buy the dip and hodl over and over may not know what they're talking about really. 

Also one more caveat- there are certainly dips worth buying too but I wouldn't wanna touch any alt coins that could disappear in the coming months personally either.

business,America’s monopolies making inflation much worse...,"“Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. In fact, why don't you go ahead and give Mr. Monopoly all your money?

Rising corporate concentration — when only a few major companies dominate an entire industry — is worsening inflation, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

In a new report, the agency finds that when production suddenly gets more expensive for companies, they often pass those costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices. When industries are more concentrated and there's less competition, however, that price hike becomes about 25 percentage points greater.

In other words, monopolies don’t necessarily cause inflation. But since they tend to overcompensate for rising production costs by quickly jacking up their prices, they can exacerbate the problem. The report didn't point fingers at any specific industry, but in recent years, the oil and meatpacking industries, to name two, are among those most frequently cited as being dominated by a handful of conglomerates — to the detriment of consumers.

     The US economy is at least 50 percent more concentrated today than it was in 2005,”

MachineLearning,"[R] Happy to share our latest Research paper: Federated Learning for Healthcare Domain - Pipeline, Applications and Challenges","Hello everyone,

We are pleased to share our new research paper with the ML community *Federated Learning for Healthcare Domain - Pipeline, Applications and Challenges.*

Our paper was accepted at ***ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare*** **2022** and published in **ACM Digital Library**.

***Federated learning*** (FL) is a novel paradigm that allows deploying large-scale machine learning models trained in different data centres without transferring data. The sensitive and distributed nature of EHR (Electronic Health Records) in real-world scenarios simulates a need for an effective mechanism to learn from data residing in health-related institutions and hospitals while accounting for data privacy. This motivates us to examine the potential and value of federated learning in the healthcare domain.

&amp;#x200B;

[Applications of federated learning in healthcare](https://preview.redd.it/h58o4rqec7291.png?width=1974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=579b0bdac8098403dc122215beb8f18734e0c321)

&amp;#x200B;

**The main contributions:**

* We demonstrate the components of the federated learning setup and discuss the communication architecture and building blocks of a federated learning system.
* We examine the various challenges that a federated learning setup faces in terms of privacy, data, and communication in the healthcare system.
* We survey existing works on federated learning in the health sector and propose a comprehensive list of applications classified into prognosis, diagnosis, and clinical workflow.

solar,"Comparing two quotes - amid ""refusal to quote""s","We are looking to set up a new system and have two different quotes in hand so far. The first is from Sunrun, from an agent we were referred to by a satisfied friend, with an on-site assessment of the roof and such; the other is from Green Power Energy, which was the only 'hit' I received on Energysage; they have not been at the property. We also tried to get a quote from another large-ish company directly and were told over the phone, based on satellite images, that our house was not eligible for solar. This is for a system in Connecticut where we currently are using about 8500 kW/year.

The SunRun quote is an 8.84 kW system using 26 JA Solar JAM60S10-340/MR panels with optimizers and a SolarEdge SE6000H inverter. Their price is $38,984 ($4.40/watt). They're suggesting 98% coverage with this. We don't care a LOT about aesthetics, but as a tiebreaker I do like the visual design of Sunrun's plan a little better because the panels are more hidden from the street. We have faith in the agent, but I'm not sure how well that faith should extend to the company.

The Green Power quote is much more extensive than the info I have from Sunrun. It's for a 10.8 kW system (estimating 8661 kwH in year one) using 30 QCell BLK-G10+ 360 Q.PEAK Duo panels and IQ8+ microinverters at a pre-rebate cost of $36,180 (3.35/watt). Even though it's 20% bigger, they're only saying 99% coverage. I've seen more positive things about Green Power here, but it is admittedly anecdotal (and mostly not from Connecticut anyway).

Factoring in the finance rates both companies quote for a ten year loan, the SunRun system actually is a little bit cheaper on the final sticker price, though it's for less kilowatts. My concerns are (1) from what I can tell, microinverters are preferable to optimizers, especially with potential for heavy shade over part of the roof and (2) at least one other company has told me my house is not suited for solar, and I'd heard similar things when I was more informally inquiring about it several years back, so I'm nervous that these nearly-100% numbers are pipe dreams when they meet reality, because it strikes me as weird that a company wouldn't even be interested to try a design. And, of course, only one company has quoted me on EnergySage, which reinforces this worry to me.

I'm also wondering if these prices are destined to stay this high, or if waiting a few months might alleviate some of the price pressures that are driving it up lately (though of course, if the prices did drop, it would have to be by more than enough to offset the reduced federal credit for 2023 probably). At this point, I'm pretty resigned to missing the summer, which is too bad since that's when I would really see the value, especially since Connecticut has net metering, but if it's likely that one or the other of those systems could get installed quickly (Green Power says their panels are USA-built, for instance), that could be a tipping point too.  I'm not interested in a battery yet, but it seems like both of these systems would be easily supplemented by a battery sometime in the future when those prices come down.

Any thoughts or tips, or questions I should be asking, are greatly appreciated!

EDIT: SunRun came back with a revised quote at 4.11/watt if I finance or $3.66 if I purchase outright, which at least SEEMS to be more in line with expectations and definitely makes the total-cost-to-own favorable over Green Power's, though still with the same seemingly less-favorable equipment. But I also now have a scheduled meeting with a local installer next week!",energy,1653742872

investing,The Benefits of Diversified Investing across different Asset Classes - A simple backtest of a low-risk portfolio through all market conditions,"Hope this post might be helpful particularly for newer investors or people that want to invest but aren't really comfortable with the level of risk on equities, or who struggle to push their money in because they are afraid of a downturn soon after. I want to show you that you can still achieve good returns with low risk. In fact your risk-adjusted returns can be clearly superior.

We all know that stocks tend to offer the highest possible returns in the long run, but the problem is that stocks come with a level of drawdown risk &gt;50%. This can be very problematic for people who are not comfortable with the idea of high drawdown. It is even more problematic for people who think they are comfortable with high risk but then find out when it happens, that they are not. This puts you at risk of committing the cardinal sin of investing – which is cashing out at a hefty loss, and not only locking in a loss, but locking yourself out of future recovery and eventual gains. 

Every investor must honestly appraise the level of risk they are taking and find a level which they are genuinely comfortable with in order to avoid the cardinal sin. The problem that creates is that you have to compromise on expected returns, but IMO too many people don’t properly explore the middle ground and understand the compromise can be net beneficial and individually tailored to suit.

Diversifying between asset classes exposes you to different levels of return and risk, but critically offers you assets which are uncorrelated or perhaps somewhat negatively correlated. This leads to the so-called ‘diversification gain’. The diversification gain is essentially the benefit you receive by never taking a massive drawdown. It is better to be taking moderate returns on a consistently larger amount of money than higher returns on a potentially much smaller amount of money. Perhaps not in terms of absolute return in the long-long run, but we’ll come to that later.

So what are the asset classes we are going to look at? I have chosen US Stock Market, US Intermediate Term Treasuries, Gold, and Cash. The comparison is simple – we’ll look at 100% stocks (the high benchmark), 100% cash (which will show you why you need to invest), and a balanced portfolio. The balanced portfolio is 45% US stocks, 32% treasuries, 8% gold, and 15% cash.

Now, before any jumps on me – yes, that is conservative. And yes, there are other classes that could be included, and yes this weight to that or that weight to the other might be ‘better’, but not the point of the post. The point is to simply look at the benefit of diversification on risk control and the compromise on returns, and what can be achieved even with a conservative approach, which I personally found surprisingly good.

I will just say a word about cash, though – the idea of cash being there is because most people, especially risk-averse people, do want to keep some cash and there is often a real-life potential need for it (unemployment, unexpected expenses etc.). It is also surprising how good the returns can be in spite of keeping cash. Further, it avails you of rebalancing opportunities, something 100% stock investors simply do not have, but I’m not going to get into that here and I’ll mention why at the end.

The backest will be done as far back as it can be done on [this tool]( https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/), which is 1972. It is very helpful that we can go back to the 70s, because we can walk through a period of high inflation and tightening monetary policy. Too many backtests only look at the post-1987 easy money era, or even the post-2008 QE era. These tests will give misleading results if the monetary conditions change. However, I’ll also show results for those to show the compromise is not too great.

So, [these are the portfolios]( https://imgur.com/a/dD5iBhS). Portfolio 1 – 100% stocks, Portfolio 2 – the balanced approach, Portfolio 3 – 100% cash (which is cash earning about what it would in a savings account btw). Portfolio 2 is rebalanced annually.

And [these are the results from 1972 until April 2022](https://imgur.com/a/PgAR4TL) – a 50 year investment horizon.

Your eyes are perhaps jumping right to the final returns, but this isn’t where they should be. Why? Firstly, you cannot be 100% stocks into retirement otherwise you are risking &gt;50% drawdown on the day you retire, and if that happens you aren’t retiring. You are going back to work until that 50% is back one way or another (or slightly less considering you get older in the meantime). If you’re relying on the market, good luck, you now need it to go up 100% to make your money back and this might take a long time.

The second reason is that you can still achieve the same return by stretching the investment horizon out, i.e. you consciously accept you might have to retire a few years later, but that your date will be better known, and your life will be much less stressful. It is impossible to chase early retirement by constantly pursuing high returns without risking much later retirement. A sensible rebalancing strategy towards conservative assets as you get close to retirement is the best approach, but again it’s not going to be covered here.
In this case, a 59 year investment horizon instead of a 50 year investment horizon would approximately equalize the returns between portfolios 1&amp;2. This is not in itself desirable, but what do you get for it?

The key is the lower drawdown. Portfolio 2 risks 20%, portfolio 1 risks 50%. That is a huge difference. And what is the difference in growth? Portfolio 1 has a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 10.5% and portfolio 2 has a CAGR of 8.9%. So really, that’s a lot of extra risk for a small overall improvement in performance. It is true that bit extra makes a big difference in the end, but then you have to face the problems of the previous paragraphs.

What really strikes me is the smoothness of portfolio 2’s equity vs portfolio 1. It’s just a pretty much constant gain with only gentle drawdowns. Look at the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. The Sharpe ratio is measure of deviation from risk-free return, the higher the deviation the lower the Sharpe. The Sortino ratio is similar but only considers downside risk – it shows how much excess return you are getting per unit of risk (if we consider risk to be drawdown) – in my mind it is the more useful indicator here.
What is also notable is that there have been periods where portfolios 1&amp;2 have approximately equalized. In 2008, portfolio 2 actually became the better performer, 36 years after the start of backtest. That’s kind of incredible considering the respective risks. Astonishingly, this result still occurs if you start the backtest at a very favourable time for portfolio 1, which I’ll show below. 

A word on data-framing. So yes, in 1974 there was a big downturn on the stock market and maybe it’s not fair to start the backtest in 1972. So let’s make this very flattering for the stock market and start in 1988, after the 1987 crash, and heralding the start of the modern easy money era with Greenspan deploying QE and the Fed put for the first time.
[It’s really not that bad for portfolio 2]( https://imgur.com/a/SBBsw9j). Portfolio 1 has a notably higher CAGR, but still much greater risk, and the Sharpe and Sortino ratios indicate portfolio 2 is the better risk-adjusted performer. And again, there was a period of merging the last time the stock market suffered. And this is if we really frame portfolio 1 favourably. 
[Now let’s do the opposite, and compare since the top of DotCom in 2000]( https://imgur.com/a/DNPpGmi). Portfolio 1 still has it’s nose out in front, but only fairly recently, and the smoothing which portfolio 2 provides is now starkly apparent. Look at the consistency of portfolio 2’s curve (and remember, there is 15% cash in here, during an era of historically low rates!). Portfolio 2 is clearly the best risk-adjusted performer. The Sharpe and Sortino ratios are incomparably better.

By now you should see that in all conditions a balanced approach yields moderate-good returns with low drawdown, whereas all equities offers a higher CAGR but at the expense of much greater risk. Assessed by risk-adjusted return, the balanced approach is clearly superior.

So that’s about it really. I’m aware that we can tinker with this and that, but my point is just to show what diversification brings, and the returns that can still be had even with a very conservative weight that includes 15% cash and 8% gold.

I hope it helps some people who aren’t really sure what to do by giving them some perspective and a viable approach. If you buy portfolio 2, you sleep well at night, you don’t worry and you don’t make mistakes. You make moderate amounts of money most of the time, and you risk only about 20%. You can keep your investments liquid and draw on them if needed. You also have a consistent approach to take to retirement. Further, you can also think about rebalancing strategies, which if performed well, can even further improve portfolio 2, but I am going to leave this because it’s not necessary and is timing to some degree. I’d encourage you to play around with the portfolio tool if you want to tweak it to something which is perfect for you personally.

personalfinance,Should I invest my home equity or wait till I actually need money for my kids' college.,"Scenario:

My wife and I make $150K/year both in healthcare. We have 2 kids (6th and 10th grade).

My home is currently valued at $580K, I owe $130K @ 2.875%.

My primary intention of use of this equity is for my kids' college fund.

Should I cash out refinance $450K at 5% APR now and store it in a Fidelity trading account in index fund ETFs till my kids graduate high school.

OR should I just keep my current mortgage and get a HELOC when we need college cash in 4-6 years. House should be paid off by this time but interest rates are likely higher if we were to borrow then.

Please let me know if you need any other information to help me make a decision. I am also open to receiving other opinions on what we should rather do with our equity.

personalfinance,How much car can I afford?,"Hi all,

I am trying to determine what is fiscally responsible/possible in financing a car. I have the car I want picked out, with a sticker price of $31k. I am fortunate enough to be in a position where I have $20k to put down on it. This makes it so my car payments would only about $220/month with a good interest rate over 60 months. I take home about $4500 a month and I’ve read not to go over about 10-20% of your take home income. Following that rule it seems I can afford a bit more car. I don’t intend to really do that but I wanted to see if this all checks out. I’m fortunate in the sense that I don’t have any other debt right now and can wait about a month on purchasing a car. Any thoughts/comments are welcome. Thanks!

investing,Recently sold an income property and did well. Should I just pay off my entire mortgage of my primary with the gains?,"I’m a bit wary of putting cash into the market right now, so paying off the mortgage on my primary seems like the best idea.

I was also thinking about only paying off 75% of it as I have a very low interest rate (3%) and investing the rest when the market bottoms out. Thoughts?

Edit: thanks for all the comments y’all. This forum seems to be very evenly split across 3 options: 

1. Pay whole mortgage off
2. Pay some mortgage off (including option to recast), invest some (50/50)
3. Invest all (DCA/conservative investments)

I went ahead and used 66% of the gain to pay down my mortgage and will invest 34% more in I-bonds, DCA, and another investment arm I have access to. This was close to my original plan and was somewhat validated by this forum.

The house I am in right now as my primary is not my forever home, but my forever home will undoubtedly cost more so I’m comfortable putting a large sum of money towards the mortgage since that housing expense will be larger in the future when I eventually trade up anyway. Better to have more of a principal paid off for when I trade up in the future as well since interest rates on a future home will be sky high. (I live in the highest COL area in the world btw.)

Another note I will make is that I didn’t have to pay cap gains on the gains from the sale of the income property because it was my primary for the first 2 of the last 5 years before I rented it out.",finance,1653761819
stocks,What's happening in the market...,"There is a likely recession occurring that could be mitigated with a soft landing. If there is a recession, it will occur in two parts:

* First phase: The fed indicates rate hikes. Increased rates results in the market demanding a higher return on equities to compensate for the additional risk, which results in a contraction in the overall market P/E ratio. But, while this is happening, the underlying performance (earnings) of equities generally remains strong. Unemployment remains low, consumers continue to spend as they have jobs and money in their pocket, and companies can pass along inflationary impacts to the customer through higher prices. I think we are at the end of this first phase.
* Second phase: Prices continue to increase to a point where demand begins to slow. As demand slows, companies have a harder time passing along increased costs to their customers. Companies tighten the belt, resulting in layoffs, which increases unemployment (obv) and reduces overall demand. At this time, the underlying performance of equities is impacted and the market falls into a death spiral. Less demand -&gt; less earnings -&gt; layoffs -&gt; less demand, etc. This death spiral is only stopped by the fed stepping in, usually through an injection of cash and lowered interest rates, to spur demand. The bottom of the market is right before this happens.

I think we are at the end of the first phase. The second phase won't start until consumers stop spending. I see a few factors that could contribute to this starting in Q3/Q4 this year:

* Consumers dip into savings this Summer to enjoy the warm weather. They will come out of the Summer with less savings available.
* Inflation on mandatory goods remains strong and outpaces salary increases. After accounting for mandatory goods, house hold budgets have very little money remaining, and the summer spending blitz extinguishes their savings. The result is less discretionary spending.
* Freeze on student debt ends in September, further tightening household budgets.
* Increased mortgage rates further tighten household budgets for any new home buyer. This will have a slower impact on demand but still contributes.

So, what would have to happen for this not to occur? It all depends on if supply can recover and meet the demand of the market, and how quickly this occurs. If this happens quick enough, the inflation on mandatory goods will stabilize, consumer discretionary spending flatlines or contracts slowly, companies manage costs without large layoffs, the market slows/stalls for a bit but then continues with moderate growth as supply/demand are back in line with each other. This is what the soft landing would look like.

My best guess is that this soft landing won't be achieved. Due to the Ukraine conflict and COVID lockdown in China, supply is disrupted long enough for us to begin the death spiral. Supply will only recover to meet demand once demand is decimated, and around this time we will see the bottom and the fed intervene.

Market prediction: Market rallies on the back of strong earnings until \~3Q of this year. At this time, people will start to talk about FOMO since they missed the bottom. At the same time, consumer demand begins to contract and the death spiral begins. This will result in a strong recession in 2023 and we will see the bottom only when the fed steps in.

personalfinance,"I just finished grad school and accepted my first job. Best way to save, pay off loans, and manage my money?","Hello Reddit!

I finished grad school earlier this month, and just accepted a job offer that pays a salary of 84k.

I wanted to get advice for the most strategic way to pay off my loans and manage my money.

I’m not completely clueless when it comes to finances, but I wanted to reach out here in case there’s anything I might not be thinking of, particularly when it comes to student loan repayment strategy. I’ve never had a salary before, have never had a retirement account before, and have never had the opportunity to build a (substantial) savings account before.

My most pressing goal I guess would be paying off my student loans. What else should I be focusing on? How should I focus on savings? Do I ???? invest??? (I’ve heard adults do that)

All my student loans are federal loans, amounting to about $61k. I roughly estimated my monthly living expenses to be $1,800. I was pretty generous with overestimating, but to be even more generous, let’s just round up to $2,000.

Does it make sense to aggressively pay off my student loans? As in, dump most of my take-home pay into my loans after rent/bills? From some quick calculations, I could probably afford to make monthly payments anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 (this upper limit if I am particularly frugal that month). This is obviously much higher than the minimum payment of $550 that I was given.

One of my benefits includes a 100% match on the first 4%. I plan to contribute the maximum amount to take advantage of this benefit (which comes out to $280 a month).

I understand that I should also probably build a savings account of 3-6 months of living expenses.

What else am I missing? What advice do you have for me?",finance,1653771397
CryptoCurrency,In a bear market you should not always look for the reversal but expect the downtrend to continue like that and plan accordingly.,"As much as we all love bull markets, we all hate bear markets. That's why in a bear market everyone just instantly starts looking for a reversal towards a bull market. This is just foolish. You should never try to swim against a fast tide but float with it.

In a bear market you should always go with the probability that it's going to go further down for at least a few weeks and plan accordingly. So you should probably not blow all your Dip-buying money on day one and then have to scrap money from elsewhere to buy.

stocks,Quantitative Tightening?,"Ever since I saw a comment talking about it in the daily discussion, I've been trying to understand it. I'm here asking for opinions so I could get a better understanding.

So, one main talking point for the bull market since Covid 2020 March, is the Fed doing this thing called Quantitative Easing. Essentially meaning they're injecting money into the market, buying bonds and mortgage securities. This created a bull market where a lot of people started investing and would be making gains.

Inflation going crazy, blablabla, you guys know all those talks for the past months.

So, the Fed is going to do Quantitative Tightening, starting June 1st. Basically reversing what they did for Easing, meaning they'll be selling the bonds and mortgage securities. From my understanding, they're not actually selling assets outright, but would be conducting passive sales by not replacing maturing securities.

Now this is where I'm confused and am seeking for your wisdom. If they're not selling outright, if I understood their approach to QT correctly, the market shouldn't be met with much selling pressure right?

Or is this the part where we should be worried because, just like we don't go against the Fed when they decided to print money in 2020, we should stay cautious if the Fed is selling?

Correct me if I'm wrong, they did QT in the past, started in Oct 2017 to Sep 2019. If I look at the chart for SPY, there're two ""big drops"" during 2018. I don't know whether this was the effect of QT, or were there something else causing those drops. Market did recover within months after those drops.


**TL;DR: QE vs QT. Market up or down if you were to make a guess based on what the Fed's doing?**

Cryp­tocur­ren­cies have fallen dra­mat­i­cally this year as in­vestors dump risky as­sets, wor­ried about ris­ing in­ter­est rates and surg­ing in­fla­tion. Coin­base in­vestors have suf­fered even more. Bit­coin was down 25% in May through Fri­day’s 5 p.m. ET level, while Coin­base has fallen around 33% this month.

Some an­a­lysts said in­vestors ex­pect ex­ec­u­tives—par­tic­u­larly founders—to sell stock in or af­ter an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing af­ter hav­ing their stakes locked up for so long.

‘These Coin­base ex­ec­u­tives main­tain large po­si­tions in the com­pany, re­flect­ing their com­mit­ment to our long-term op­por­tu­ni-ties,’ a Coin­base spokesman said.

Mr. Arm­strong and his liv­ing trust sold shares for to­tal pro­ceeds of $292 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Jour­nal’s analy­sis of reg­u­la­tory fil­ings. He still holds a con­trol­ling stake in the com­pany, with 59.5% of vot­ing power, ac­cord­ing to an April reg­u­la­tory fil­ing.

Ms. Choi ex­er­cised op­tions at a cost of $9.7 mil­lion and sold shares for to­tal pro­ceeds of $226 mil­lion, while Mr. Chat­ter­jee ex­er­cised op­tions at a cost of $6 mil­lion and sold shares for to­tal pro­ceeds of $110 mil­lion.

Mr. Ehrsam pock­eted nearly half a bil­lion dol­lars in stock sales dur­ing the pe­riod. Ear­lier this month, as the stock sank to lows, Mr. Ehrsam bought $75 mil­lion worth of shares on be­half of the cryp­tocur­rency in­vest­ment firm he co-founded, Par­adigm One L.P. A reg­u­la­tory fil­ing on Thurs­day showed he bought an ad­di­tional $1.8 mil­lion worth of stock ear­lier this week on be­half of Par­adigm One.

A big chunk of the share sales hap­pened the first day of trad­ing, as all four sold stock in Coin­base’s di­rect list­ing. In a di­rect list­ing, early in­vestors typ­i­cally sell por­tions of their to­tal hold­ings to en­able out­siders to buy into the com­pany on the open­ing day of trad­ing. Such sales are crit­i­cal for di­rect list­ings to go smoothly, as the com­pany typ­i­cally doesn’t sell any shares, in con­trast to an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing.”

Where I work is a local government agency and through the contract, we have two 457(b) investment options. One is through Empower and the other is through OneAmerica.

I currently invest in the OneAmerica 457(b), but after seeing no Vanguard options and actively beginning to plan my retirement as I have a pension (45% of the three highest years before retiring with access at 20 years of service), two 457(b) options and a low likelihood of having social security available, I would like some assistance with my investment options if y'all would be so kind as to provide some opinions on such.

I am currently finishing the enrollment with the Empower option, and will stop the OneAmerica contributions, as they have an SDBA through the 457(b) with access to a few decent low expense funds. I will list them below and would love some feedback! I am not heavily interested in bonds, managed asset allocations or fixed income assets as I have time to ride the market and would prefer ETF/Index funds. I'm also not super worried about foreign investments, but I'm open to the suggestions.

I am currently saving a lawfully mandated 10.5% in the pension system, which is very healthy with high contributions and low payments, currently sitting at $27m in assets and growing. I am not worried about losing it and I plan to withdraw a lump sum at retirement to invest in a tIRA. I do plan to up my contributions from $200 per paycheck (Roth, 26x per year) to $350 per paycheck (Roth, 26x per year) for the Roth 457(b).

I want to select 2 currency pairs for forex trading. I've decided one and that is EUR/USD. Now I can't decide between 3 pairs to pick my second pair and these are:

- GBP/JPY
- GBP/USD
- AUD/USD

I want to select GBP/JPY cuz I've been reading it since Jan this year and I've become familiar with it. 

Only problem is not a senior trader said that GBP/JPY has major retail investment so typical price action won't work on it. I've had good trades with GBP/JPY and now I'm confused. Should I ditch GBP/JPY based on what this person said or select GBP/JPY as my regular trading pair? 

I only want to trade 2 pairs. I'm fed up of trading different pairs every week which is why I've stopped making currency strength meter as well (CSM gave really good trading opportunities but I find it so hard to motivate myself in terms of reading charts of new pairs every week).",finance,1653806699
CryptoCurrency,What Coins/Tokens You ACTUALLY Use?,"I mean, coins/tokens which you don't hold for profit (ofc I know there are times you need to sell for realizing the juice).

Also, please explain what are you using them for. No shilling, just write your coin/ttoken and what are you using them. No need for ""... and has great ecosystem etcetc"" Just the coin/token, and what are you using them for.

For me:

XMR - if I happen to find some, I'm using that to buy goods and services

XLM - if I want to transfer for basically 0 fee, I convert the asset to XLM, send it to xy exchange/whatever, convert back to the asset I want

Doge - This may not be relevant, but I like sending 1 Doge to friends at random intervals.

I use some more crypto for staking/getting airdrops, but those I would consider profiting, not a use case.

And... basically that's it for me. These are the coins I USE, and I don't hodl them for profit. The Doge one MIGHT be considered ""hodling"", because as I said I like to send them to friends, have like 800 or so. But I'm not holding those for profs, those all will be sent out eventually.

Between equity and appreciation we could likely sell and pocket 100k + in cash. 

The problem is we don’t want to stay here much longer. For our careers location does not matter too much and we are tired of living in an area that everyone is moving to. Traffic is awful, everything is getting more expensive and there is still nothing to do. 

I’m not sure where we want to move yet, but am fairly certain it will be somewhere with a lower COL. Think Cincinnatti Ohio, Asheville NC etc. Because of this I would like to live in an RV for a year or two to figure out where we belong. That leaves two options.

Option A 

Sell the house. Buy the motor home and stick the rest in the bank for when we eventually want to return to home ownership.

Option B

Rent the house out. Clear 4/500 a month profit and keep building equity while living in the motor home. Sell when we need down payment money for the next home. 

Option C

personalfinance,First (real) job at 25. Is my budget enough for proper savings? Am I contributing to retirement properly?,"So I have (finally) graduated and I am done with school (bachelors + doctorate). I am in a healthcare field where a doctorate is the entry level degree, but the pay doesn't necessarily equate to that. I worked throughout school, but this is my first real job with a salary. My significant other (accountant) and I sat down a few weeks ago and developed a broad budget for myself. My family have always said I'm a penny pincher and I want to start feeling comfortable spending money on my life, but I also want to save. I'm hoping my budget allows me to both spend and save, but I'm nervous I'm not saving enough. I'm also unsure about if I am allocating enough to retirement at this point in time (25 years old). 

I have been living off my savings and a bit of loans/scholarships my last year of school as I was completing a year long, 60 hour a week internship. I have spent a bit more out of my saving the past few months than I anticipated, due to car repairs, moving expenses, rising costs of everything, and my job starting 1.5 months later than I initially hoped. I have had a lot of recent anxiety about money with my depleting savings, I'm hoping once I start to replenish it some anxiety will diminish. I grew up with parents who had terrible money management who fought about money a lot, so I just really want to do better than they did. 

&amp;#x200B;

My salary is going to be 63k a year, we anticipate about $1800 a check but I will know for certain after my first check. $1800 a check is after taxes and parking (I work at a hospital). It does not account for retirement or insurance. Luckily I don't turn Spring 2023 and will stay on my mothers insurance until then (which I don't pay premiums for). So **monthly take home is \~$3600**, July will be \~$1800, October \~$5400. 

My employer does not have a 403b match, they do have a 403b available if I want to use one, I wasn't planning to use this though. I plan to max out a Roth IRA each year (including this year). My employer does have a pension, which they put 15% of my salary into each year and its vested after 3 years. I am only on a 1 year contract for my first job (fellowship), but I have high hopes of being hired on after and my employer has mentioned the potential for being hired long term after. 

I do have 49k in student loans (all federal), payments will be due November or December 2022. I plan to go on an income driven repayment plan and avalanche the debt as some grad school loans are 6.08%. My payment on a 10 year plan is $525 and I plan to pay that much each month with an avalanche method, more when able. My job is PSLF eligible, but with my debt and income and my SOs income, it is borderline worth it. 

Below are some basic expenses/budget lines:

Rent: **$750** a month

Utilities: \~**$120** a month

Car payment + car insurance: **$215;** my car is paid off February 2023 so this number will drop to $60 then, I plan to keep my car for a while after it is paid off but its 11 years old now and has given me issues in the past. 

Estimated spending on credit cards (paid in full each month): **\~$600-700**; right now I'm spending about $400 a month on cards, but my SO picks up a lot of expenses and we plan to shift the expenses to more of a 50/50 once I have a salary. These CC expenses include: gas, groceries, going out to eat, and new clothes. 

After all expenses (including loans) we anticipate I will be able to save 6k a year into my IRA and 5k into savings. Next year I can likely contribute 10k a year into my savings and the 6k IRA. My savings currently sits at 25k, but will likely drop to 23k by the time I start due to living on savings. I am worried about savings as we hope to purchase a home in the next year or so (once I get a more permanent position) and get married (pay for a wedding). My father said he has 10k saved for me to put towards a home or wedding which is helpful. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my real questions are: am I saving enough in retirement right now, am I saving enough for big life events, is there anything wrong with my budget? Any advice, insight, and tips are appreciated.

Edit: Please no shame for going to school so long and taking on debt for this income. My debt is low for my field and I knew income was like this. Unfortunately, some very important healthcare fields require long of schooling and income doesn’t match, that’s the reality of it. 

Edit 2: For our first home we are looking at spending under 275k, there are houses in our region for this. Wedding we are looking for something smaller, but not an elopement. The wedding is probably 4-5 years away if I had to guess.",finance,1653839110

My husband &amp; I were both in prior marriages where saving wasn't a priority (more like paycheck to paycheck), &amp; then shortly after we married, my husband had a massive brain hemorrhage/stroke which left him partially paralyzed (left side) &amp; in a wheelchair.

To keep this succinct, let's just say it took us awhile to recover financially, but to give you the whole picture, I need to add that we are now also raising 3 granddaughters - 17, 15, &amp; 10.  (The older girls &amp; family members know we can't continue to offer much financially once they are 18, &amp; the 10 year old may later go back to her parent's.) 

We never got the chance to really contribute to our retirement savings, &amp; this is where we now find ourselves...

- Husband is 62 &amp; receives $1950 a month in social security.

- I am 55, &amp; gross $50k - take home is $2900 monthly.  (As an FYI, I just started this higher paying job the day of the lockdown, and then Covid had me on reduced hours including furlough, but I'm back to FT &amp; just asked for &amp; received a $5k raise in January.)

- We receive $500 a month total in child support (but since it's not court ordered, I don't think we can count it as income for income documentation purposes.)

- Savings - $25k (This is 6 months of my gross salary.)

- Stocks - Currently down to about $25k (&amp; as an FYI, we mainly bought these in 2020 &amp; predominantly went for growth stocks in an effort to play catch up.)

- 2021 $7k Roth IRA contribution (also currently down)

- Car debt - $18k, &amp; pymt is $280 (only have/need 1 car, but it has to be reliable)

- My student loan debt - $60k (I had just finished my BS when we met, &amp; the stroke situation hindered repayment.  I'm currently on income-based with $0 pymt due.)

- We assumed a family member's FHA loan, &amp; our house pymt is $1000.  We owe $111k, but it's now worth $265k.  We've updated the entire home (all paid for), &amp; our interest rate is 3.25%.  The remaining mortgage is 22 years.

- No cc debt or any other debt - just the mortgage, car, &amp; student loans.

Credit Scores - Mine are around 800, &amp; my husband's are around 740.

- Just have to add that in the last few years, we did use our savings to:

- Invest $25k in our home improvement (It was a fixer which is how we got the deal.)

- Pay $15k in equity to said family member for the assumption.

- Bought $30k in stocks (We had planned to sell some at a profit to put towards my student loans but had not realized how selling would affect our Earned Income Credit so we left it all in the market.)

- Contributed $7k to my Roth IRA 

- Used $4k to help go toward a down pymt on a new car.  (With used car prices, it made more sense to buy new, &amp; we needed a bigger car.)

Additional info...

We have been working HARD with the plan to buy investment property, &amp; needless to say, we were hoping for lower prices &amp; interest, but we don't know about holding off even longer...

I've been researching &amp; studying real estate investing for years, have kept up with the market in several areas for years (&amp; had just gotten my RE license to enter that field when the granddaughters came to live with us, but due to their arrival, I opted not to make the financial change) so this has been a long term goal.

So with our circumstances, we are thinking we would like to use the equity in our home to accomplish 2 things...

- Pay down the student loans.  We would at least like to get them to about $25k minimum.

- Buy an income property - Down payment of approximately $40k.  We have thought about every scenario in various locations, but we have decided to most likely focus on buying a condo in our school district (which is highly sought out).  The complex is adding new builds, &amp; we anticipate them selling for around $200k, the HOA is $100, &amp; the rent is approximately $1700.  We have a tenant already in mind if we go this route.  I think we should be able to qualify.

So - if you found yourselves in our situation (which I hope no one ever does!) what would you do??  

And if you would advise using the equity, would you recommend a HELOC, Cash out refi, etc.??

Thanks for reading, &amp; for any constructive advice!

&gt; The benchmark index of dollar-denominated EM sovereign bonds, the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified, has delivered total returns of around minus 15 per cent so far in 2022, its worst start to the year since 1994. The decline has only been slightly eased by the broad rally across global markets in recent days, which ended a seven-week losing streak for Wall Street stocks.

&gt; Nearly $36bn has flowed out of emerging market mutual and exchange traded bond funds since the start of the year, according to data from EPFR; equity market flows have also gone into reverse since the start of this month.

Why is this happening?

- Pandemic lockdowns (e.g., China)
- Rising interest rates in the US and other rich countries devalue the debt of cheap countries leading to bond sell-offs.
- Many countries heavily rely on Russian oil (e.g., Hungary).
- General geopolitical uncertainty with Russia and China
- The USD is appreciating to historically high levels (to 2002 levels)
- Lower expectations of global growth cutting into emerging market equities


You can gain exposure to emerging countries with a general ex-US fund like VXUS, which holds 25% in emerging economies. You could overweight emerging directly or beyond this level, but the large negative skew in returns in emerging economies makes this a bit risky ([negative skew looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/YdOwpTJ.png), occurring when there are extreme outcomes to the downside relative to the center). Emerging economies are more likely to undergo total collapse than richer ones. 

For those of you who are super-bearish and listen to Jeremy Grantham (I usually do not), he actually expects negative returns everywhere except in emerging markets, and in particular recommends emerging market value. [Here are his 7 year forecasts.](https://i.imgur.com/qXuOf3M.png) (Personally, I think his US predictions are a bit absurd) You can directly invest in emerging market value through the Avantis fund AVES, and they offer AVEM for general emerging markets.

Emerging and ex-US countries have larger concentration in industrials, commodities, energy, etc. If you don't like the tech-heaviness of the American market in general, this is another reason to diversify internationally. Years like 2022 show how important energy can be to a portfolio, for instance.

So are index funds at risk of this kind of climate fanaticism. Are funds at risk of being driven by politics rather than real returns?

I see some things put out by iShares now, so it seems they could be headed down that path. Could hypothetically an alternative non-politically centric etf focused on pure growth outperform an iShares fund in the long run?

CryptoCurrency,"A Coherent investment thesis looking forward to ""bear market"" and ETH merge","Wrote this as advice to another user in another thread, however I think its useful as its own OP. My general strategy is to DCA into ETH, and soft short it while doing so. I invest in fundamental theses. Here is my framework:

**Why do Cryptocurrency cycles happen?**

Because of the nature of proof of work, and how it works in the original asset with largest capitalization: BTC. BTC security is provided by miners, who have fixed operating costs. BTC emits supply as a subsidy for this security (in addition to txn fees on network), and this emission halves to asymptotically reach 21 million as a supply.

When it does, a structural seller in the market (BTC miners), are less willing to sell at low prices due to fixed operational costs, this causes price to rise. This slow rise attracts smart and dumb money as it goes higher due to incoming capital. This demand is in fiat ($) and does not scale with current price.

However, as price rises, the structural seller (miners) is exponentially more incentivized to sell, and do so. This sell pressure is in native onchain token/asset (BTC) and scales with current price.

Eventually the linear/decaying demand on new mania capital is overtaken by the structural selling. This leads to fear, and further capitulization. Some people, who notice this cycle, stay, and miners of course do not sell below operational cost. So price returns to an equilibrium between natural demand and structural supply, usually higher than before halvening because of those who stayed rather than ran away.

**How do you fundamentally value crypto?**

Blockchains with byzantine fault tolerance, as a whole, is a way to use technology to reduce the economic transaction costs of trust in holding, securing and exchanging value/tokenized value (assets). Their effectiveness at this is determined by **how secure they are to exogenous attacks, how many interesting nodes/users exist on the ledger** and **how long they are expected to live.** Because these factors determine its economic bandwidth, and generally how much capital is likely to risk itself living on said chain.

1. **Security** \-&gt; the economic cost of attacking the chain to censor/roll back transactions or double spend etc. Also includes marginal cost of repeatedly attacking / attacking again.
2. **# Interesting nodes/users** \-&gt; Metcalfe's law; i.e. that upper bound of value of a network, or use cases on network, are determined by # of nodes, as more interesting things can happen (e.g. a telephone network connecting 10 people is less generally useful than one connecting 100,000 people). Another factor related to metcalfe's law is the number of interesting functions/actions other than ""send/receive the native asset"" that exist.
3. **Life expectancy of chain** \-&gt; Lindy effect, mathematical conjecture that you are most likely to observe something in the middle of its lifespan, so if thing X survived for Y years, the life expectancy for thing X is 2Y. Blockchains with value/TVL have a honey pot, the integral of this pot value over the amount of time that the chain has existed and defended against attack successfully; is roughly the ""factor"" for capital's comfort coming into/onto the chain.

This framework coherently explains why BTC market cap is above ETH, and why ETH market cap is biggest compared to all of its alt-L1 competitors. No one has a time machine, so new alt-L1s and new BTC clones can't build lindy, # of interesting nodes, liquidity, security etc. required to sustain an ecosystem around a blockchain.

Crucially, the use case of this new technology has one other limiting factor, computational scalability, which prevents its use in many potential use cases other than simple and complex finance. There is currently no solution to this that does not sacrifice security or # interesting nodes/users (alt-L1s with bigger and quicker blocks lose security, roll ups and zk roll ups lose composability and thus some connection to the existing ETH ecosystem). However, roll ups and newish math like ZKPs allow compression of information and ""verified"" off chain computation/state change, and are the current best solution to scaling that does not sacrifice much security and not all composability. 

**What is a good strategy going forward?**

Because of macro environment and progression/time of the cycle we are in, it is best to accumulate and bet on the downside to hedge catching falling knives. Currently, the dominant monetary system (Fed) is tightening money and capital supply in order to fight inflation/price rise in goods, either a change in that policy, or a fundamental structural change in flows (like a halvening) for either BTC or ETH is needed, as the two chains with biggest lindy and market cap.

Next Fed meeting is in June, likely to still be hawkish or bearish. But certain things that are counter to current gloom and doom: Month to Month inflation is at \~4%, while the more lagging Y to Y CPI print is whats at 8% like so many people cite when shilling their shitcoin bags (""HFSP with 8% inflation dollars!""). This may mean Fed eases on tightening capital supply.

The other counter-narrative to multi-year bear market doomerism is that Ethereum merge will reduce the structural sellers of ETH, since pure Proof of Stake provides a magnitude more security, and high marginal cost of repeated attack, for the same $ of security cost in either fees or seignorage supply inflation. Personally, as a software engineer and experienced trader, I see this as the most unpriced fact by dumb money and even some smart money. This change is a severe similar structural change in flows as a BTC halvening, but less likely to affect assets outside of the ETH ecosystem as it is less dominant in capitalization as BTC.

However structural flows for ETH will benefit from:

* Reduction in security costs, and thus structural sell pressure of about $7-9B a year at current price and mcap. due to merge
* Even low onchain activity from either users or roll ups being sufficient to displace supply from validator seignorage.
* Additional demand from staking yields boosted by MEV (validators and decentralized ETH staking pools with validators can extract MEV)

**Therefore, my strategy is the following:**

1. I DCA $25k-$40k a week into ETH, I lock this ETH in either Aave or Alchemix
2. I borrow at negative interest (Alchemix) or positive low (0.7%) interest (Aave), in ETH, against my DCA'd ETH
3. I exchange said ETH for GLP on Arbitrum (a liquidity pool for a very good decentralized perps exchange that is half stables, and half ETH/BTC/Uni etc.), that pays \~13% APR in ETH, and about 11% APR in GMX
4. If price continues to go down for ETH, the GLP should go down slower, providing a soft short for ETH. If price goes to say $1600, and I sold my borrowed ETH at $1800, I can convert from GLP -&gt; ETH, pay back my loan, and keep difference as additional ETH.
5. If price goes up, the GLP APR should help slowly pay off ETH borrowed (in addition to negative interest on Alchemix)
6. If macro conditions or market conditions change, convert GLP back to ETH, pay off debt or if not enough, convert to rETH and wait for long term hold (years), take hit and burn collateral to sell if  required.

Bias disclaimer: I am currently deploying about $500k in capital behind accumulating Ethereum while Fed / macro is hostile and merge is still to risky to low information market participants to price correctly.",cryptocurrency,1653854332

personalfinance,Flight school help! Big loans and possibly no health insurance?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 27 year old flight attendant at a major US carrier and I was accepted into another US carrier's flight school program, which is an intensive program that requires me to relocate to Phoenix and possibly quit my job (which provides my health insurance).

I don't have too much in savings (about $15K) and I won't be having any income for a year when I start my flight training. I live with my boyfriend of 3 years (also a flight attendant) who is willing to relocate with me and basically foot most of the living cost bills while I'm in flight school. We live in Los Angeles now so moving to Phoenix will bring our cost of living down, but we will still be down to one person's income.

Now, for the flight school, they require that I provide proof of funds of $85K so I definitely need to take out a loan of at least $70K. They have partnered with Zuntafi and Sallie Mae and encourage us to apply for loans with them but based on some (very superficial) research that I've done so far, it appears that Zuntafi and Sallie Mae are not the best when it comes to student loans. I was wondering if anyone has any advice regarding those two companies, or whether I should go with another lender such as Sofi or Discover?

I also currently have a FICO score of 803, and was wondering if I should ask my parents (with excellent credit and much longer credit history) to co-sign, if that will bring my interest rates down? Or will that be unnecessary since my score is pretty high on its own? Also, should I go with fixed or variable loans?

(I already have about $23K of student loans remaining from my undergraduate as well, that I haven't been paying any of since the COVID moratorium on student loan payments.)

Another concern for me is my health insurance. I have asked my manager to allow me to take a long leave but they have not gotten back to me about it, and I am concerned that they will not approve a year long leave so that I can go fly for their competitor. I know I won't be able to afford the Cobra payments, so I was wondering if I could apply for Covered California, even though I will be temporarily residing in Arizona. I have not yet updated my address with the DMV from my parents' home in Los Angeles, and I plan to come back to LA most weekends, so I wonder if that would still make me qualify for Medi-Cal (which comes out to about $240 a month for me). Or I was wondering if Arizona has a similar program to Medi-Cal, where the state subsidizes health insurance for students with no income like me. Does anyone have any tips on how I can maintain my health insurance in a cost-effective and legal way?

Maybe I've misunderstood something relating to money market funds during inflationary periods. My thinking process is: 

1. Inflation will (eventually) result in higher interest rates
2. The first ones drive increased rates are seemingly primarily short term rates 
3. Money Market funds, such as the UBS (Lux) Money Market Fund (USD), etc, invest in short term interest rate instruments connected to the US Dollar. Things like Certificates of Deposits or Repo-rate instruments. 
4. The above interest documents all should, as interest rates increase, increase the value of the MM-fund.

CryptoCurrency,BitPay scam warning | DO NOT USE BITPAY,"**TLDR at bottom.**

About two weeks ago, I tried to purchase a product online using  Litecoin. The merchant uses Bitpay as an intermediary to process the crypto transaction. A BitPay invoice was generated at checkout and I was  prompted (by Bitpay) to choose a wallet service. I have a Coinbase  account so I used that to send the money to the Bitpay invoice. When I  went to send the money I was prompted by Coinbase to verify my identity.  By the time the ID verification completed, the invoice expired.  Coinbase still sent the LTC to the Bitpay invoice, but my order with the  merchant did not go through. Now I have about $2500 worth of LTC stuck  in Bitpay's crypto wallet.  Coinbase support is unable to do anything since the transaction is  completed. I've spoken with them and they say it is up to Bitpay to fix  this. 

I have been calling Bitpay support basically every day for the  past two weeks and they are useless. They act like  programmed robots with no sympathy for the issue I am facing, like it is  just another routine. They give me the workaround and do absolutely  nothing to resolve this issue. They tell me they will update my support  ticket and I will receive an email within 24 hours. I have heard that  about 5 times and have received no email. I have received exactly 2 emails through my support ticket from an agent named ""Katniss,"" who  claims her department is short staffed, yet every time I call support I  am immediately connected with an agent.  

I am starting to consider legal action against this company. I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, the FTC, and my state attorney general. There are  numerous reviews on [this website](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/bitpay.com)stating similar  experiences. There is something going on with Bitpay. They may not be  intentionally scamming users (or they may be), but their service allows for many issues  in which money becomes ""lost in limbo"" and their customer support is  literally useless in helping resolve any issues. I am making this post to raise more awareness about Bitpay. Bitpay is a very popular intermediary  for company's that would like their customers to be able to transact  with their desired cryptocurrencies, so the fact that this activity  occurs is very distressing, especially since many merchants are probably  not even aware of this issue taking place.

Rising bond yields and recession fears have been weighing on the tech sector since late last year.

Fortunately, U.S. stocks recovered last week and stopped the losing streak. The Nasdaq rebounded nearly 7% for the week.

Bank of America had previously predicted that in order to avoid worsening economic conditions, the Fed may pause in September to tighten policy.

JPMorgan Chase bluntly stated in the report that the stock market may be close to bottoming out, as the amount of corporate buybacks announced so far this year has reached a record $429 billion, stronger than the same period in 2019 and 2021.

**So what's there to watch when market sentiment turns positive?**

**Micron Technology ranks first in the ""cheap"" list, with a forward price-earnings ratio of only 5.8 times**

Barron's has compiled a list of tech stocks that are ""worth picking up bargains"" as U.S. stocks pick up. The criteria for listing are: Nasdaq 100 $NDX constituents that have fallen more than 20% this year (calculated for dividend impact), and forward P/E ratios below 16.7 times (average of S&amp;P 500 constituents, based on expected 2023 revenue) , while sales are expected to grow by at least 8% in 2023.

In the end, only 7 stocks met the above screening criteria.

In terms of forward P/E ratios, the cheapest on this list is Micron Technology $MU. Shares are down 21% so far this year and trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 5.8, with sales expected to rise 20.3% in 2023.

Chip giant Qualcomm $QCOM is No. 2 on the list, with its shares down 23% this year. It is understood that the company is increasing investment in improving business diversity to reduce its dependence on Apple orders, and it is making efforts in the fields of automobiles, VR (virtual reality) and computers.

Shares of Facebook, which changed its name to Meta $FB last year, fell more than 42% in 2022, and its earnings report said the shift in focus to the ""metaverse"" would be expensive. The company's advertising business is also challenged by TikTok and Apple's $AAPL privacy reforms that have upended the company's successful model of advertising on mobile devices. But Barron's believes the stock is a bargain given the company's 12.6 times forward price-to-earnings ratio and 16.3% sales growth forecast.

This was followed by Applied Materials $AMAT and Lim Research $LRCX. The two semiconductor equipment makers trade at 13.5 and 14.1 times forward earnings, respectively.

At the bottom of the list are Google $GOOGL and Netflix $NFLX. Google trades at 15 times forward earnings and is expected to grow sales by 16.3% in 2023. Notably, macroeconomic concerns could put some pressure on Google's search and cloud businesses in the coming months. Last Tuesday, the stock price of snapchat $SNAP, which is also in the Internet industry, plunged 43% after the earnings report missed expectations. The company's CEO Evan Spiegel said: ""The macroeconomic environment is definitely deteriorating faster than we expected,"" he said, adding The company is slowing hiring to manage spending more carefully, it said.

But if you look below the surface of macro-economics , emerging data is showing signs that it could be cut short, and potentially only be a correction.","Before cosplaying as Michael Bury, or going all in on shorts, check the latest economic data. It's not the sure-fire doomsday scenario it was 2 months ago.

# The herd.

When it comes to investing, be careful of following the herd.

Last year, the herd thought Bitcoin was heading to the moon and could hit $100K. And that's when the herd was overbuying.

Things aren't looking good. But is the data really showing only doomsday? I'll explore that in details.

Not every correction is a recession. Not every bear market is long term (see the 2013 mini bear market of 5 months for Bitcoin).

&amp;#x200B;

# Inflation:

This is the big one. Inflation is still high, but it's showing signs of slowing down, and potentially having peaked already. If it starts going down, will it still be able to fuel further market fears?

Both CPI and PCE rates have slowed down.

\-CPI slowed from 8.5% in March down to 8.2% in April.

\-PCE has slowed from 6.6% in March down to 6.2% in April.

Obviously real inflation is higher, but these are important for later when we talk about Fed rates.

But what about food and gas still being so expensive? It still costs me so much, how can it have peaked? That brings up the next two points.

&amp;#x200B;

# Supply chain:

Probably one of the biggest wrench getting in the way of economic growth in the last 2 years.

Luckily, the supply chain is beginning to reopen, and the bottleneck is getting unclogged. But it has been an uneven recovery.

While you see a lot of items back on the shelves, and shipment taking less time, you have other items like baby formula vanishing from the shelves.

The big one everyone is waiting for is for China to join in that de-clogging. They're still behind due to their more recent lockdowns.

In the US this year:

47% drop in ship congestion (those ships anchored waiting outside a port).

12% increase in containers in the main ports (LA, New Jersey, New York, Long beach).

In Europe, they experienced a setback with the war in Ukraine. With some ports getting increases in delays by several hours, sometimes up to two days.

In terms of sea shipping  worldwide, the bottleneck is still high thanks to China and Russia, but we are starting to also see signs that it has peaked:

&amp;#x200B;

Things are still not looking great and are uneven, but it looks like in many countries we are starting to see things turn around.

Overall, the world waiting time for all cargo ships has dropped. Going from 17 million container waiting days down to 6 million.

&amp;#x200B;

# Oil: the domino effect that could put the breaks on a recession.

Oil prices has everyone worried.

It has also been a big contributors for rising CPI numbers, and the perceived inflation.

It has also been a problem for supply chains, along with businesses. And has put strain on many companies in the stock market.

So it's been in the middle of almost all of our problems.

Here's some good news.

One of the main reason it's so high, is because OPEC hasn't increased the output to keep up with the big emerging demand from the post covid crisis, nor make up for the strain from the war in Ukraine.

The purposely held back output to let price rises, to makeup for all the money they lost when oil prices tanked in 2020. 

OPEC is actually due to increase the output in July, per their internal agreement, by 400K barrels per day. So relief will begin this summer.

The G7 meeting has asked them to increase it by even more. So we'll have to see how big the relief will be.

If oil price output increases significantly, it could bring the price down more significantly, helping everything from inflation to supply chains and businesses.

And it could create a domino effect that could help ignite a potential recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fed rates:

Rates don't have much uncertainty left. Feds have already laid out the roadmap. We know how high they want to go. And unless inflation starts to spiral out of control again, it looks like they are targeting 2-2.5% rates. So only going back to pre-covid rates.

These are still economic stimulation level of rates. They're not high rates.

Now that we got a good idea on how fast they'll go with the point basis, there's not much left that hasn't been priced in already.

The only question is the Fed balance sheet unloading. That's a little harder to predict the effect. But there won't be a selling off, they'll just let bonds expire.

Also, keep in mind that legislation has changed a little, with the ability for banks to get their liquidity. So it won't be quiet the same as it was in the past.

# War in Ukraine:

I can't really say too much about this. There's no clear metrics to talk about here.

This could end next month, or it could end in 5 years.

One thing we do know, is Putin wasn't able to roll over Ukraine, and move on to the next conquest.

In terms of market uncertainty, it has fizzled out a little bit, and is nowhere near at the level of fear as the early days of the war.

&amp;#x200B;

# US GDP:

This is the one place where we can still see an alarming case for a recession.

The GDP has decreased by 1.5%.

That's as bad as it can get.

But a big part of that decrease was actually caused by the trade deficit, rather than a decrease in spending. Consumer spending actually increased by 2.7%. Inflation adjusted, it still increased by 0.7%.

Also, supply chain issues, and slower inventory accumulation fueled that decrease. The effect of high inflation also didn't help.

But if those problems have already reached their peak, ports are now getting unclogged, and with the trade deficit already going back down, we can have better expectations for much better GDP numbers next quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

# Can we still have a recession?

Yes.

Both in crypto and other markets.

While things may look like they have reached their peak, and there are some improvements already, you never know when there could be set backs.

So I'm definitely not trying to be Nostradamus here. I'm just saying a recession is not 100% in the cards. In fact, it may be starting to diminish in probabilities.

This is definitely not your 2008 recession. We still have low unemployment, a strong housing market, trade deficit dropping 15.9%, growing consumer spending, and we don't have foreclosures popping up everywhere.

Bankruptcies filling have also been dropping in the US:

What's important is to understand the cause of all this, to understand if we are heading straight into a recession.

&amp;#x200B;

# The cause.

Where did it all go wrong, and how did we get here in both crypto and other markets?

Long story short: liquidity supply crunch.

Both crypto and stocks have been getting extra fuel with the extra liquidity being printed into the market.

Both went a little too high too fast, and got a little overbought.

It was natural that we'd get a correction once the Fed turned off that printer.

So this isn't exactly a crash where you have foreclosures popping up all over neighborhoods, bankruptcies, and financial institutions collapsing, like in 2008.

This is more the market correcting to adjust back to normal pre-covid liquidity.

In fact, for crypto, it may not even be like 2018, and be more like 2013.

# tl;dr:

All the same macos that were supporting the theory that we were heading into a long recession, are now showing signs of either peaking, slowing down, or even turning around.

And if a couple of key macros like GDP, supply chain, or oil have a significant turnaround, it could create a domino effect that could fuel a recovery. Or at the very least erase a lot of the fuel behind the recession.

And all 3 are showing data that they are likely to turn around in the coming months.

This doesn't mean it will necessarily happen, or that we won't have a long recession. There's still a strong possibility. Just not as strong as many people think, and definitely not close to 100%. And the likelihood has begun to decrease.",cryptocurrency,1653929385

personalfinance,Can and should I refinance the car under my name?,"Hello all. My husband and I are hoping to be able to buy a house within the next 9 months or so. His credit is not that great and mine is excellent but it will not help us since I do not work, I will not be able to be in the loan. The only debt we have is a car we are currently making payments on. It is under my husbands name with a horrible interest rate since we took it out when his credit was even worse. 

I was thinking, since I won’t be able to “use my credit” towards the house anyways and we have a predatory rate on the car that maybe it makes sense to refinance the car under my name? That would also help us in buying the house since it will improve the debt to income ratio my husband appears to have? And it would also help my credit, I assume, over the months since I currently only have revolving accounts.

My understanding is his credit would take a hit from “paying off” the car loan but I assume 9 months would be enough to offset that?

Can we “refinance” removing him from the loan completely however? And if not, is it still worth it to co-sign on a refinance for a lower rate? Thank you for your help!

I am excited to see if this holds up or not with the upcoming monthly data.
 
More evidence in the US is coming that inflation has peaked. Here are some snippets from this [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lumber-prices-slump-with-rising-interest-rates-11653835230?mod=hp_lead_pos8).


[Lumber prices](https://i.imgur.com/RQPQM7V.png) are crashing:

&gt; Lumber futures for July delivery ended Friday at $695.10 per thousand board feet, **down 52% from a high in early March.** On-the-spot wood prices have plunged, too. Pricing service Random Lengths said Friday that its framing composite index, which tracks cash sales, fell about 12% last week to end at $794. That is down from $1,334 in March, just before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.  

More anecdotally:

&gt; In a monthly survey of building-products dealers, just **12%** of respondents said they had slightly low to very tight inventories of lumber and wood panels in April, down from **61%** that claimed low supplies a year earlier, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting. 
Moreover:

Housing is being affected by rate hikes:

&gt; The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was **5.1% last week**, **up from 3.1%** at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac, an increase that has further strained affordability. **Sales of newly built homes fell 16.6% in April from March**, to the lowest level since April 2020, when lockdowns convulsed markets. It was the **biggest drop in nine years**, the Commerce Department said last week.

stocks,Anyone under 40 has never invested in a Bear Market &amp; It shows - Long $GLD and $XLE,"If you are 40 today, you would been 26 in 2008-2009.  That is on average the age that adults consider buying their first house, new car, get married, and are in their first career job/profession.  So anyone under 40 has never invested in a bear market. 

This isn't saying experience and age makes you a better investor.  It does however mean that many here are out of their element and have never invested in stocks during a bear market.  Tech stocks were in a bear market from 1999-2012.  That's 12 years.  Assuming that your high growth stocks will recover to ATH's soon is a risky investment strategy.

What has worked well during a tightening monetary policy is commodities, crude oil, gold and dividend stocks.  And while history never repeats exactly, I find it interesting that my best performing stocks are also the same type of stocks that outperformed from 2002-2008 and 2010-2012 until the Fed started QE into infinity.  $HAL, $PSX, $CLF, $MOS, $GOLD, and $FCX are a few that have done very well for me.  

I think this market is trading less on inflation being transitory or non-transitory and more on the Fed's response by tightening. The market doesn't care about inflation.  All it cares about is the Fed's response to inflation and whether the Fed will continue to tighten monetary policy and increase Interest rates and by how much.  And anyone under 40 has never invested in a market where the Fed has tightened.  Growth stocks will not regain prior highs until the Fed switches from a tight to loose monetary policy.

&gt;  
&gt;The deadline for members of Congress to file their annual financial disclosures for 2021 was May 16. But as usual, most members availed themselves of a 90-day extension that will give them until sometime in August to release their reports. The disclosures list their household assets, as well as other information like outside positions and travel reimbursements, and are often dumped online as hundreds of pages of illegible paper scans.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the Senate, just 23 senators filed their 2021 annual disclosures by the deadline. A review of this batch of disclosures shows that last year at least three more senators appear to have violated the STOCK Act’s requirement that they disclose certain financial transactions made by their households within 45 days.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two senators, Democrats John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Gary Peters of Michigan, filed periodic transaction reports (PTRs) on May 16, 2022, for transactions they made in 2021. The transactions were also included in their 2021 annual disclosures. The third, Republican Jerry Moran of Kansas, has not yet addressed his missing periodic transaction report from last year for stock transactions that appeared in his 2021 annual disclosure for the first time.

I have various cc debts and a personal loan for debt consolidation I did a year ago totaling approximately 10k, and this post will not be regarding my student loan debt. If you’re wondering where this debt comes from, it comes from hard times and when I got this new higher paying job that required investing thousands in tools.

My question is:

I’ve been very good on payments, trying to do minimum payments on most and paying aggressively towards 2 debtors. My personal loan debtor offered to refinance my loan, offering a lower rate and still offering a higher loan amount. This is the lowest interest rate I was ever offered at 17%, yes I know it’s terrible, while most other cards are around 20% +.

By the end of the year I expect to get a significant raise and hopefully I will finally be able to have a savings at this point at early 30s 😔.

1. use the refinanced personal loan and consolidate all debt at 10k?

2. Use the refinanced loan to only refinance the current amount of that particular debtor of 5k, and maintain the course of payments I’ve been doing?

* Significant inflation (and the measures already taken and planned to combat it, such as rising interest rates, the Fed reducing its balance sheet etc.)

* The Ukraine crisis, which led to massive disruptions across several sectors including energy and consumer products

* The wider supply chain disruption, which impacts the flow of goods

Me and my wife want to move to Utah to take advantage of our remote jobs and do some outdoor adventuring totally different from what we've done in the past. We expect it to be expensive and to stretch our budget but I think we can do it. Please help me make sure my plan isn't darn right foolhardy, and see if I missed anything important. For instance today I found out Utah has income tax and Washington doesn't so our income is less than I though in Utah. 

So anywho the plan. 

We should be able to sell our house, pay off every piece of debt we have including a truck, some small credit card balance, and our cell phones which will minimize our monthly expenditures with no planned increase until we grow into our budget more. Our gross combined income is 132000 gross, and currently in Washington we bring just under 7200 net income per month. 

Doing this should give us 150k we could put down on a new house in hurricane Utah or nearby. I believe we can afford up to about 2000 per month in mortgage but would be more comfortable at 1500+. I also know this is a stretch today, so we intend on making it work a little higher like maybe 2400 or so til we can refinance. 

I could post a more extensive budget with intended spending on food and gas and so on, but I'm mostly concerned with the bigger items as the others we can be a little more flexible on. 

So the questions....

How much house can I really afford? My googlings lead me to believe we can responsibly afford up to around 500k or so. We've been pre-approved a loan up to like 650 (gross) and the last interest rate I got quoted was 5.7%. We have very good credit right around 800. 

Is there any other unexpected savings or cost I should expect moving from Washington to Utah like the income tax? $500 less per month because of taxes is a pretty big hit to the budget. 

Would it be dumb to sell, bank the money and wait for interest rates and home prices to drop? We found some apartments we could make work for around 1700 a month.

At present, the market's expectation of the Fed's interest rate hike has been relatively fully taken into account.

&gt;Core capex growth represents a [massive economic tailwind](https://www.tker.co/p/saving-job-openings-capex-orders). And the fact that it continues to grow, albeit at a decelerating pace, is a good sign for economy-wide growth.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to [S&amp;P Global Flash US Manufacturing PMI](https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/b669b93cb25f4270952e1d9a03be464e) report released on Wednesday, these emerging economic trends have continued into May. Specifically, the composite output index fell to a four-month low of 53.8 in May. For this index, any reading above 50 signals growth, and so the declining number suggests growth is decelerating.

personalfinance,Pulling house equity for a car?,"To preface, my wife and I only need one car since I work from home. We signed for this house back in 2020 as a new build. Our house floor plan is now selling in the neighborhood for $160K more. I want to see if I can pull and of that equity to attach to the car loan so I can get what is 3.5% interest rate on the vehicle loan. 

Is this possible? Is this a situation I would refinance?

Edit: thanks all! Will go with a traditional auto loan",finance,1653970246
Bitcoin,"Are we early, or do people just not care to learn.","I work in finance, and can tell you, it is incredibly frustrating going to /r/personalfinance and giving advice to people that just want to sit around smelling their own farts. That is a place where people are supposed to know what they are talking about, and practically everyone there thinks that finance, means budgeting. 

Financing has been around for thousands of years, and yet people have very little basic knowledge about even the concept of money, let alone the cost of it. 

It gets so bad that I can't help but to sit there and say that it feels like I'm ""early"" to the concept of interest rates. When in reality, the stupidity of the people are what the central planners are counting on. They aren't hiding their theft from regular people, they are just operating out of another dimension.

I wonder if Bitcoin will suffer eternally due to the people that it benefits, having no real interest in learning why or how, and the people that do understand it, all have much more to gain from gaming the system.

history: has had sensitive stomach issues, throws up yellow bile when he doesn't eat but that's all. 
clinical signs: he had began pooping liquid last night and threw up some white chunks. he threw up three more times after that with the last one having small specks of blood. that happened briefly(vomit) then he stopped but the diarrhea continued in the vet. they took some blood work and this is what it showed. this is the first time this has happened and he's still playing around and energized and everything but i just feel so bad
because i don't know what happened overnight, i was working and he was with my boyfriend : ((. i feel so guilty. he didn’t want to eat anything, he sniffed everything and walked away. he didn’t want any water  either.
What should I do after getting this blood work?

CryptoCurrency,Why Wouldn’t You?,"Interest rates are higher and it likely will raise more. The fed is fucked. The US will not flat out ban crypto. There will be regulation. It’s still the beginning.

These are the things I tell myself when I’m about to make impactful financial decisions. Maybe I’m way out in left field.. 

It always comes down to these options: 
Put x$ into savings 
Put x$ into crypto

Time is of the essence in these decisions. There is a balance to be aimed for.

The crypto market over the last two years or so has taught me one important thing above all; any crypto can half or double at any point. Or more..

Not a biblical revelation by any means,
I know. 

But the reality, it’s a simple one I remind myself of constantly.

personalfinance,"Having our first house built by the end of the year, did we buy too much?","Hey all, as the title says me and the wife signed on a house to be built by the end of this year. We make a combined $130k per year. House cost comes to $385k with a 4.15% interest rate. Putting down 5% for a conventional fixed loan. 

If my calculations are correct our monthly mortgage (with high taxes, specials, PMI etc) will be around ~$2950/m. (We currently pay $1450/m on rent)

For building we do get a tax abatement for the first two years which should bring the monthly down to ~$2650/m temporarily. 

While I believe we’ll be able to make this work, I’d like the thoughts of the community on what to expect and how you think we’ll do. 

(My only other debt is a $300/m payment on my car which should be paid off in 2-3 years. (Wife’s car is paid off))

We are brand new to home owning so we expect there to be a lot of additional costs.  

With it being a new build, we’ll eventually need to buy grass, mower, snowblower, fence etc

Polkadot,Polkadot cross-chain bridge,"Web 3.0, the next generation of the Internet, is envisioned as a fully functional, user-friendly web where our identities and data are our own — thanks to decentralized blockchain technology, they can be secured The land is protected and will not be attached to any centralized power subject. Polkadot was created in line with this vision: no single blockchain can do everything; that is, the future is multi-chain.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0u0m39ywir291.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d228d3a36285dc2ff7b98ac3309a13636cd088a

However, as the number (and often size) of blockchain networks continues to grow, **Bridge Smart Contract Development Services** they remain largely isolated from each other, like islands with their own communities and economies, unable to exchange information or value with the outside world. Today, the isolation of blockchain networks runs counter to the principles of decentralization and reflects the balkanization of the existing centralized Web 2.0 world (the fragmentation of Fragmentation under the system, i.e. “fragmentation”).

**What is a bridge? Where is it important?**

A blockchain bridge is a connection that allows tokens and arbitrary data to be transferred from one blockchain network to another. Two chains can have different protocols, rules, communities, and governance models, but bridges provide a compatible way to securely interoperate on both sides.

Bridges come in many different designs, but they generally fall into two camps: centralized bridges that rely on trust or federation, and more decentralized so-called “trusless” bridges. Centralized bridges rely on some type of central authority or system to operate, which means users need to trust an intermediary to use a given application or service.

By contrast, trustless bridges are those where the user does not have to trust a single entity or authority, but needs to trust the mathematical truth built into the code. Trustless interactions are enabled by the technology (and incentives) behind the system, not by commitments or legal agreements.

Polkadot is designed as an underlying infrastructure to enable the scalability, interoperability, and security required for future multi-chains, allowing different Layer 1 parachains to interact and communicate with each other in the ecosystem. But Polkadot also allows parachains to interoperate with external networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum via bridges. Some bridges have been developed or are under development to connect Polkadot with these external networks. Because Polkadot is designed to minimize intermediaries in digital systems, trustless bridges are often preferred in ecosystems.

**An example of a bridge**

A decentralized insurance market can be imagined as a practical example of a bridge. One way to create this marketplace on Polkadot is to deploy a specialized insurance parachain that acts as a marketplace for buyers and sellers of insurance. Suppose Polkadot also includes an oracle parachain that brings external data on-chain, and an Internet of Things (IoT) parachain that aggregates information from off-chain IoT devices.

In the case where you have purchased flight delay insurance, the payout policy may be set up so that if the oracle parachain confirms that your flight is delayed and the IoT parachain confirms that you arrived at the airport on time, the policy will pay out the compensation. On-chain, if the insurance parachain receives signals from both the oracle and the IoT parachain, it can use the Ethereum bridge to trigger a transaction to transfer a stablecoin (such as Dai) from the insurance company account to the policy holder account. This relatively simple example demonstrates the power of interoperability.

Polkadot is designed for a future where not only can we see applications primarily exist in one network, they can occasionally utilize other networks for simple transactions. Even these applications can go further than that, they can be deployed across multiple chains, each with varying degrees of customization. High-quality bridges bring us one step closer to this future.

**Bridging Substrate-based chains**

The Substrate blockchain building framework can be used to architect parachains with their own consensus and security (when combined with the Cumulus consensus engine) and blockchains that operate independently. While parachains connected and secured by Polkadot or Kusama Relay Chains are first-level citizens of the ecosystem, **Cross chain bridge development** Substrate-based standalone chains can also bridge and communicate with ecosystem parachains.

The Parity team is currently developing a generic bridge that can connect Substrate-based chains. This bridge consists of multiple components that together support bidirectional communication between a Substrate-based standalone chain and a Polkadot parachain, or two-way communication between two Substrate-based standalone chains. In particular, this bridge will enable the Polkadot and Kusama networks to interact with each other. You can view progress on Parity’s trustless bridges at the Parity Bridges repository page.

**Bridge supported by Web3 Foundation grants**

Web3 Foundation funding projects have supported the development of many bridges to the Polkadot ecosystem, including the following projects:

**Interlay**

Building a trustless bridge from Bitcoin to Polkadot. Currently in beta testing, it will allow users to mint PolkaBTC, a 1:1 Bitcoin reserve-backed asset, and bring it to Polkadot. PolkaBTC can be used with any application or parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem, just like a native asset, to unlock BTC liquidity for Polkadot DeFi. Internally, PolkaBTC implements the XCLAIM protocol, which makes the bridge financially trustless, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. PolkaBTC’s incentivized beta testnet went live at the end of February with significant improvements to the user experience. Meanwhile, PolkaBTC is being audited by the NCC, and Interlay has started integrating PolkaBTC with other parachains on Rococo.

**Snowfork**

A common functional bridge is being built between Ethereum and Polkadot. It can not only transfer ETH from Ethereum to Polkadot, but also transfer ERC20 assets and arbitrary data. In addition to asset transfers, the bridge can also be used for more complex interactions such as cross-chain invocation of smart contracts. For example, **Build a cross chain bridge** any application built on Polkadot can use the bridge to send Dai directly from one account on the Ethereum chain to another.

**Darwinia**

A permissionless non-custodial bridge protocol is being built that features efficient, low-cost cross-chain token decentralization and non-fungible token (NFT) transfers, as well as other cross-chain operations. The Darwinia bridge integrates technologies such as ultra-light clients, zero-knowledge and optimistic verification mechanisms. Darwinia has already launched a bridge with Ethereum, and plans to implement more bridges connecting important heterogeneous blockchains in the future, such as BSC, Tron, Filecoin, etc.

**Centrifuge**

Collaborated with ChainSafe to develop a modular, asset-agnostic, multi-directional bridge between Substrate-based blockchains and Ethereum. ChainBridge allows Centrifuge to transfer homogenized tokens and NFTs between chains, making it possible to finance real-world assets through various DeFi products. ChainBridge is open source, and it also allows other teams in the ecosystem to build bridges with their own projects.

Crypto Asset Gateway

**ChainX**

There are plans to connect multiple networks and a BTC to Substrate bridge has been implemented. In this design, the bridge is operated by validators, staked in ChainX’s proof-of-stake consensus to control the BTC multi-signature wallet.

**Bifrost**

An EOS network bridge was developed to implement on-chain light nodes by using merkle tree verification to enable trustless cross-chain asset transfer. The third version of their testnet, Bifrost Asgard CC3, was released recently. In the future, Bitfrost plans to work on interoperability with EOS contracts.

**Bridging the Web 3.0 Future**

CryptoCurrency,Made an interesting observation today!,"now majority of the people are bearish, tbh so was I, but I just made an observation and now I myself feel a tad bit more confident about the bottom being close. don't want to spread any fake hopium though.

# Fact: Bitcoin, and the stock market move inversely with the price of US dollar. 

now a lot more factors come into moving the price of stocks and crypto actually. but let's just set this as a base for now, without considering APES, FOMO buyers, institutional buyers, interest rates, inflation, yadda yadda stuff that accelerates growth of assets tremendously.

let's take this instance.  


[31st March low on the USD. been highlighted till it's latest high](https://preview.redd.it/2vfb1ww7ls291.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=819e04f366094b121046405f5fe0368023600497)

now comparing it with Bitcoin and S&amp;P with the same timeline:  


[blue line representing S&amp;P. yellow line representing BTC](https://preview.redd.it/njzbbm8mms291.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f9ec16cd385de6c8af7ff3c668cb30908268e49)

notice how it stopped dropping and went sideways before going up a little bit? Right when the DXY started dropping?  


now this is the correlation Im referring to.

Now that the relationship between the stocks and the dollar index has been established, I'll be digging a bit more into the dollar chart!  


&amp;#x200B;

[the dollar is in a long term downtrend, due to inflation! this is why we see most of our assets in a long term uptrend.](https://preview.redd.it/pgh3gp5cns291.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85c7e9d1228fb65298f1f8b649d4c35887bb4192)

&amp;#x200B;

[and that's exactly why we saw Bitcoin and S&amp;P making new highs throughout 2020-2021](https://preview.redd.it/rpbs75dz0t291.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2120f767188e5dec09de05a438dcc1f6be5e82a)

now I've flipped the DXY index chart. and saw a triple bottom forming!  


&amp;#x200B;

[here we're seeing a triple bottom, which means the price is bound to go down, unless it breaks the \\""resistance\\""](https://preview.redd.it/i6fky6rz1t291.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06a54f169fcdb7cc324df7ac7aa0f6c446991a80)

I, personally interpret that this is a crucial moment to look out for, if the DXY breaks 105$ and goes above in price, we're definitely screwed, but if this triple bottom plays out, which is a strong indicator btw, then this should technically push the price of BTC and stock market UP.

personalfinance,Pay off debt or Invest 48k.,"Hey guys,

I’ve posted this quite a few times over the last year, but I am approaching the time to make a decision. 

Quick backstory: 30 y/o married, 1 toddler, 1 on the way in August. Since 2020 reduced our debt from 166k to now 68k which is only student loans. 

Combined income is 200-220k. My wife is taking the year off with the new baby, starting June, and will go down to 140-150k

Our net worth is 375k. (Last time I looked before the markets decreased)

529: 3800

Crypto: 600

Cash in HYSA: ~67k

Paid off car: 23k 

Misc other items: 30k

Retirement accounts: 105k collectively (have been focusing on paying down debt aggressively last couple of years vs investing). 

We owe 374k on our home worth around 585k with an interest rate of 2.99%

Federal loans: 20,700 interest rates 3.8% or less. Currently on hold, will be 75 per month starting august. 

Private loans: 48,700 at 3.85% currently 293 a month

My question is, am I making the right move by paying off the 48,700 at a whole, this month? I understand the markets are down and it wouldn’t be a guarantee to gain over time when paying off the debt is 100% guaranteed return of 3.8%. I’m like 99% towards paying the loan off. 

It would leave me with 17k left as an emergency fund (3 months) and I would be able to save 500-1500 a month depending on OT. (500 without OT). My wife wouldn’t be working from June 2022 until September 2023 (Teacher). I will be continuing the 10% to my 401k and my employer contributes 7%. 

I keep asking this because the world keeps getting more expensive, constantly changing, and this would be one of the biggest sums of money I’ve spent at once. Also, making a big change by going down to one income. I want to make sure I am on the right path. 

Opinions? yet again. Thank you.

EDIT: After reading through the comments and much consideration, we just put 30k towards the private loan and going to hold on to 37k in the savings account. We will continue to save and wait until baby and mama are healthy and settled, after birth. Then, we will pay the remaining balance of 18k sometime in the fall. Thank you all for your advice and suggestions!",finance,1654003667

personalfinance,Is it better to buy a house now or wait three years?,"I feel very lucky to own a house in a desirable city. I bought a small place when I was single about four years ago. Since then, I met a girl, got married, and now family planning is on the horizon. We both love our current house, but agree that it would be too small with two kids. Our plan was to move to a bigger place with a better school district in about three years.

Now, the current interest rate hikes and the rapidly rising prices of housing in our city have us worried. The down payment that we should be able to get by selling our house now is high enough to get us into a house we would like now, but is that still true for three years from now? Even if we have to supplement the down payment with other savings, our ability to save for a down payment might be outpaced by the rate that housing prices are rising.

At the same time, would we put ourselves at risk by buying now? We haven't lived with the budget of having a kid, so is it really a good idea to add a larger mortgage payment before that? Also, what happens if the market reverses and puts us underwater on the new house? We plan on being there long term, but that seems like a financial situation that we wouldn't want to be in.

It's been hard to find people that are in our situation, and the advice we've gotten from our parents has been a mixed bag of uncertainty. Is there even a better answer?",finance,1654006781

My income is $75k, 50k student loan debt but at low interest rate @ 4%. I have $12k saved up but $4-5k would probably be a down payment.

Two quandaries on buying down:

1) We plan to be in the house longer than 40 months so if interest rate drops below 4% I could refi, and would save that cash to not buy down now. But what are the odds the rate drops that much in ~4 years?

investing,LETFS can have a responsible use case,"Hi all,

This sub had a recent thread that seemed to turn into a total echo chamber on this subject. I spend most of my time trying to tamp down the excessive optimism in r/LETFs but from what I saw irrational pessimism on these instruments is dominant here. So lets discuss, hopefully in good faith. I enjoy debating the merits of this stuff, so I intend on posting more here in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

(1) **Daily rebalancing is in and of itself a cost.** This is one big myth. As AQR points out: "" Levered portfolios require an additional  rebalancing process, but this does not cause  any special “drag” effects beyond the normal  compounding effects of investments at a similar  risk level, and some additional transaction  costs  Moderately levered portfolios of liquid  instruments can be suitable for long-term  investors, subject to their risk preferences."" All these examples of ""market goes up 10% then down 10%"" that show LETFS losing money due to so called drag involve the market mean reverting within the period described, which is tantamount to saying swing trading would beat the market! Rebalancing, aside from costs involved in doing so, is not a source of greater returns, or a market timing strategy would work. There is absolutely 0 reason to say that daily rebalancing should in general lose to, or beat, monthly rebalancing. If you have a view on that, you have a view on timing the market.  

(2) **3X leverage is needed to generate high returns.** I spend much of my time in the LETF subreddit debunking this nonsense. It is indeed true very few markets are high enough returning and stable enough to reward 3X leverage. But 2X leverage does dramatically increase returns, more than quadrupling average lump sum ending balance over 30 year periods from 1920-2021, and more than tripling DCA balances over 30 year periods from 1920-2021 (less time to compound dillutes DCA advantage) based on Robert Shiller's monthly data assuming a borrowing cost of the Fed Funds rate+85 basis points. One annoying aspect of the current LETF market is that 3X levered ETFs are cheaper than 2X levered ones, such that half in UPRO half in VOO beats all in SSO. But 85 basis points, roughly 45 per turn of leverage in management fees and 40 worth of spreads is quite reasonable as an approximation for UPRO. Download Shiller's data and assume higher fees and spreads if you want to stress test, I've done so a great deal. Even many of the more bearish users such as Modern Footblal in r/LETFS admit that 2X leverage with reasonable stock market returns does increase ending balance. 3X leverage is a whole different ballgame. 

&amp;#x200B;

(3) **There is no tax advantage to leverage** This is a key point very few people talk about. UPRO has had a tax cost basis WAY lower than SPY or VOO. This is analogous to the interest tax shield in corporate finance/private equity. They use the dividends to pay the interest costs, thus avoiding the need to distribute capital gains. Most backtests don't account for this, which arguadly would reduce CAGR of SPY/VOO by as much as 0.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

(4) **Historically US equity returns continuing is needed for leverage to work** I actually made a post in the LETF sub pointing out Shiller's arguments that we should adjust down historical stock market returns to reflect the fact that most economists don't think the US stock market performance will be repeated. But 2X leverage still handily wins in maximizing ending balance over long periods, both with DCA and lump sum, if you adjust down historical returns 1% or 2%. Moreover, the fed funds rate is unlikely to average 3.7% as it did in the past, more like 2% seems likely as a long term average, so leverage is far more likely to be rewarded. 

(5) **Risk adjusted returns are all that matter in investing.** I readily admit that LETFS will always have slightly worse risk adjusted returns than SPY, at least ignoring potential tax alpha. But if you are just looking to maximize your money far in the future, and have a good emergency fund and confidence in your ability to earn enough money to support your lifestyle, risk adjusted returns aren't necessarily the most important thing to you. If you for instance are a FIRE type DCAing into UDOW and UPRO will probably get you there quicker than SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's enough for now. I genuinely believe that the current LETFS will be a much more important area of finance in the future given it looks like low interest rates are a long term thing, and I welcome an honest discussion about them.",finance,1654023332

personalfinance,How are treasury bills taxed,"Need some help to figure out how treasury bills are taxed. Specifically, which portion of the gains are taxed as regular income, which portion is taxed as capital gain, which portion of the gain is state tax exempted.   

I find the explanation in Fidelity [https://www.fidelity.com/fixed-income-bonds/individual-bonds/us-treasury-bonds](https://www.fidelity.com/fixed-income-bonds/individual-bonds/us-treasury-bonds), and copied below:

&gt;*Interest income from Treasury bonds is exempt from state and local income taxes, but is subject to federal income taxes. Other components of your return, however, may be taxable when the bonds are sold or mature. If you buy a bond for less than face value on the secondary market (known as a market discount) and you either hold it until maturity or sell it at a profit, that gain will be subject to federal and state taxes.* 

Treasury bills has zero coupon. All the gains are from purchasing at a discount. So None of the gains are state tax exempted? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Buying a bond at market discount is different than buying a bond at Original Issue Discount (OID). When a bond is sold or matures, gains resulting from purchasing a bond at market discount are treated as capital gains while OID gains are treated as a type of income.*

So if I purchase treasury bills in secondary market, then all the gains are treated as capital gains? 

If I purchase the original treasury bill (treasury auction new issue):

* When the treasury bill matures, then all the gains are treated as regular income?
* When I sold the treasury bill at profit, then the gains are treated regular income or capital gain?",finance,1654026577
personalfinance,Is it wise to contribute 100% of my pay into my TSP,"I am 29(m) and I feel like I am behind on saving for retirement. I spent most of my 20s accumulating money since I was living with my parents until I turned 28, and I had very few expenses. I started a job with the federal government right when I turned 27 and I got started on a TSP. I did not have a 401k prior to this 

I was contributing 3% in my TSP until last fall, and then I bumped up to 5% after realizing I was essentially throwing free money away since my employer provides contributions up to 5%. I again bumped it up to 10% a few weeks ago, but I honestly am feeling like I can probably do more. 

I am considering bumping my TSP up to 100% for at least a few months to help me catch up, and then I would dial it back to like 10-15%. I did a rough calculation of my monthly expenses and I have enough saved up where if I quit my job today, I could cover my expenses for the next 25-30 months. Granted I am also planning to take a luxurious international trip in the fall, so it is probably less than 25-30 months in actuality.   

Is it advisable I temporarily deposit my entire pay check into my TSP? Also, is there any sort of penalty I could be hit with for contributing 100% of my paycheck into my TSP?

I'm thinking we'll likely need between $50-70k for all of this. Right now we owe around $220k, so I know the equity is there, I just don't know what our best option is. I like refinancing because I like the simplicity of having one loan and one payment, but I don't like the huge headache and paperwork that comes with refinancing. A HELOC sounds much easier, but I don't like that I'll be paying my mortgage + another payment, which would likely be at a higher interest rate than my mortgage.

personalfinance,my dad has been in debt forever of his life and it's just very complicated,"hey folks, my dad has probably been in debt since he was 22 and got his first job, he bought some random car that he later sold for half of the price since he could not pay off the debt to a private lender and kept paying the EMIs for rest for 2-3 years.

he has some massive serious issues with finances. He has a good charm and ability to influence people (I honestly don't know how).

He started an insurance agent job at 25 which allows him to take cash from customers and he is supposed to deposit it to the insurance company which he often is not able to do has he uses the customer's cash to spend on his things or on interests of the loans.

in his mid 30s, he started a NGO just for fuck sake and hired multiple photo graphers &amp; a huge hall at least 15 times to make a film of him portraying doing the good things for society ALL OF THIS ON DEBTS from some another private lender who charges well above 5% interest per month.

he sponsored a local school's garden &amp; classrooms, our city's 5 km's road construction all while taking another debt at 6% interest per month.

my whole family does not understand exactly what he wants out of life however he surely doesn't seem to understand what he is doing. He is my father, gave birth to me and allowed me in his home while I was age 0 to age 18, it was a huge help because otherwise I would not even be here writing this thread and of-course he only sponsored all my school bills and food along with my mum's and my younger brother and I have huge respect for him to do this.

he was under massive debts when I was 16 and he sold the house and my grand-dad's properties to pay it off and get some extra cash which he again used to spend it all on that stupid fake NGO he runs and was again starting to go in debt and then got a little stable when lots of fights started happening in my home because of this.

we had to move back to our village home with our grand dad and grandma, it was tough on my mum but it was still better than living on road. when I went to college, I always felt the need to never ask for money from my dad and took education loan and personal loan to fund food &amp; hostel bills.

with everything I earned by doing hackathons, competitions and part time college jobs  - I spent it on getting a laptop for myself and then sending 90% of the rest to my dad to pay off his loan.

once I was in my final year - my dad dropped a huge bomb that we are again in massive debts now and he has already taken loan on our village's home and we are left with only 1 asset - a shop in the city &amp; that he had to take multiple loans from our relatives (all of them mostly)

it has been 2 years since I have been working full time and 1 year since I've been out of college, I have given 90% of what I have made till 1.5 years of work to my dad. my mum asked me to stop the funds to my dad post that. the crazy part is my dad never shows me any finances and does not tell (no matter how hard I ask) who are these lenders and if I can request them for some waive off at-least on interests.

now I have not been sending money to my dad for 6 months and he is in a really really bad place both mentally and physically. He has some disease which decreases his neural energy which makes me tear up every time I think of how hard it must be for him to take all this huge debt load.

I honestly want to pay off everything including paying the loan to lenders, the home loan and get my dad's car back to him however I feel shit because I do not earn enough for it at all.

currently, I'm among the top 5% of fresh graduate Comp Sci graduate's salary as I was able to get a decent paying job however it is no where close to paying the full loan right now. I'm living as frugal as I can \[I can surely cut further though by moving back home\], these days I spend \~20% of my annual income on myself + my younger brother's education + my mum and am saving the rest for my dad for the last 6 months.

by this pace it'll take me another 3-4 years to pay off this loan completely however my dad keep asking for full money right at the moment so that he does not have to head down in front of these private lenders.

can someone please advice how I should go about this. my mum does not want to sell our city shop as that is our last asset and we know this loop will repeat sooner or later. however my dad is adamant on transferring my full year's income worth of funds to be transferred to him. my dad has raised me &amp; fed me - I want to help him as much I can.

*sorry for the extremely lengthy post.*

I feel horrible for myself every time I see a happy family that I've still not been able to make my family happy with basic needs. my younger brother doesn't go out at all to save money &amp; keep studying so he can help my dad too soon, my mum wear shit clothes and eat super basic home food &amp; has been doing for several decades, my grand dad died soon after my dad sold all his properties while crying in front of me several times. I really want to make enough money to settle this once and for all and reset my family's situation and bring everyone to positive trend in life style and internal happiness.

I somewhere know, I can do it however with this job, I'm not able to do this right now and I do not see anyway for me to make a half million bucks.",finance,1654031001

personalfinance,What’s my odds of being approved for a loan?,"Hey this is a bit of a strech but I have 4 credit cards that report to my personal credit score all 4 of those cards are maxed and I have 2 loans as well to pay off 3 of the 4 cards will be about 2700 to pay off total. The total for all cards it’ll be about 5500 because one of my cards has a 3300 balance but I figured it’ll be easier to get the 2700 as it is a smaller amount my because of my ooor credit performance my score dropped significantly too 480-500 range (Experian) I don’t think there’s too many loan options for that score but I figured I’ll ask anyway because you never know. If I don’t get the loan then my plan is to just pay off the 3 out of 4 cards gradually (I believe I can achieve that in 6 Months) but I would like to speed up the process if normal 

Cards: 

Capital One Spark Business - 493(CB) 500(CL) 

Amex Everyday - 860(CB)-1000(CL) 

Navy Fed Platinum - 1200(CB)-1200(CL) 

Discover It - 3260(CB) - 3300(CL) 

I have one missed payment on my credit report as well it may be the better option too just pay it off gradually haha",finance,1654037164
nuclear,Books on nuclear law in the United States,"Interested in reading in depth about the Atomic Energy Commission and it’s formation as well as the Atomic Energy Act and any subsequent, relevant literature on states vs. federals rights issues in terms of possessing radioactive materials, deploying reactors and generally engaging in anything nuclear related.  Any favorite books out there?  I’m considering going back to school for nuclear engineering later in life with an earlier liberal arts background and thought it would help to form a realistic foundation for these issues.

personalfinance,Questions about becoming 1099 and paying quarterly tax,"Hi guys, I'd appreciate some help if you are familiar with paying quarterly taxes as a 1099 worker.

I've been with a company as a W-2 employee and they recently switched me to 1099 contractor as of May 2022 - as far as I understand I need to start paying quarterly tax payments.

I can estimate how much expenses I would have for the year and I guess I would be calculating how much taxes I need to pay based on how much income I had at the time I am paying the quarterly taxes minus what I have already paid for the year.

My questions are:

1. Are you supposed to pay both federal (at [IRS.gov](https://IRS.gov)) and state (at my residency state)?
2. For those who pay quarterly taxes as a 1099 employee, do you have any resources that I could use to calculate what I should pay for this coming June 15, 2022?
3. Any tips on calculating quarterly tax payments, in terms of how much and to whom, would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",finance,1654040542
