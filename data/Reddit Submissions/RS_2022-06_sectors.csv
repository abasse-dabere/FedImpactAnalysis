CryptoCurrency,"The market is pumping, and so is crypto!","The Fed is loosening its monetary policies and they're going to be lowering interest rates very soon!

Unfortunately, the pump I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going up very rapidly. 

But no worries, its never too late to get in! The pace at which the stock market is going up can very likely cause a situation where everyone in this has the potential of becoming millionaires by Christmas! 

With the market pumping like never before, people are pouring their money into the market like never before including students taking student loans to go all in in their investments!

The Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market, especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a uptrend in the general economy.

solar,"Solar and Roof Quote Advice (Long Island, NY)","Hi everyone,

After receiving multiple quotes, this is the best one that I have that includes the cost of a new roof and two skylights. My roof is about 10-12 years old as per previous owner therefore I figured it would be the wiser decision to change the roof now as opposed to later down the line where removing and reinstalling the solar panels would be involved.

What does everyone think of this proposal? My average bill per month is $150. Located in Long Island, NY:

I know I am getting screwed with the lender fees by financing, but I do not have $37k to fork over at the moment. The monthly payments were calculated after deducting the 26% fed tax credit and NYS rebate of $5k.

I figured my average bill right now is $150, might as well pay $25 extra per month and get a new roof and skylights. Things will likely keep getting expensive if I decide on waiting until my roof actually reaches end of life, not to mention missing out on the fed tax rebate.

personalfinance,Selling my first investment property.,"Background: 32M with stay-at-home wife and two young kids. We live in the midwest.

Financial situation: ~150k annual income. Only debt is one vehicle and mortgage. Currently have ~50k in 401k, 10k in HSA and 30k in savings account. ~120k equity in primary residence.

Last year I bought a rural property and totally renovated it, doing most of the work myself. This was my first purchase and renovation using skills I learned growing up in a blue-collar family.

I rented the property for the last year and made $600 per month above the monthly payment. The renters have been great but their situation changed and they are looking to move soon. Given their change in circumstance and the current state of the market, it seems to be the right time to sell.

I will be listing the property next week. Based on the realtors analysis and prior appraisals, I expect to clear between 100k-120k on the transaction after commissions etc.

I am trying to decide how to handle the money once the property sells. I dont come from a wealthy family and this is by far the largest amount of money I've received in one lump-sum.

A few things I am considering:
- Purchase another property to renovate. I enjoyed the process and would like to do it again. If not now, sometime in the future.
- Purchase a single or multi-family unit and hold long term for the rental income.
- Pay it on my primary mortgage. Current interest rate is below 3%.
- Sit on the cash and wait for the market to come down. Either real estate or stock market.

Since i rented the property for a year, I believe with the first two options above I could use a 1031 exchange to postpone taxes?  I will verify with a tax professional.

personalfinance,Is Opening a HELOC the right choice for me?,"Hello all;

I know there are many threads on this in the past on this sub, but I am interested in conversation my specific situation outlined below. My question to the sub is this, should we pull the trigger on the HELOC? 

Current home value: $310k, bought it at $225k. 

Home needs a bathroom built in the partially finished basement and our deck needs to be replaced as it is a safety hazard (even though it is only a few feet off the ground). We also have a $20k cc consolidation loan. This would all be through my credit union that I have been with for over 10 years. The HELOC would be up to $57k. We would use 30-35ish of it to pay off high interest debts, and use the remaining funds for renovations and to dump some into an actual emergency savings account that we don't have enough money in to feel safe. My HELOC rate would be 5.5% for 15yr term (obviously would make every attempt to pay it off MUCH faster). 

According to my affordability calculator, doing this would add over $600 to our monthly budget due to paying off the other higher interest debts. The goal is to eliminate all of these so that we can then focus on our dreaded student loans. We don't have the on hand cash to pay off these debts without the HELOC and doing these renovations wouldn't be possible in the near term future as we just wouldn't have the cash liquid to pay for these projects (I plan to do the work myself with some family that are in the trades). 

My wife and I are 27, have owned our house for two years now, and bring in roughly $7500/7600 per month as a household. A good chunk of that money ends up with student loans, vehicle payments, and our mortgage ($1500/month). We ran the numbers with an affordability calculator and a traditional cash out refi is not possible as we can only get 80% in cash out leaving us with a new mortgage at double the interest rate for basically the same value, so no cash to do the reno's nor to pay off debts.

Just hoping for additional opinions / thoughts if this is a good idea to tackle our goals full well knowing the risk of HELOC's.

I’ve been struggling to decide how to use the proceeds of a recent house sale. I’m extremely fortunate in the sense that we gained a decent amount of equity over the course of 4 years or so, and I’m trying to figure out what to do. Here’s the scenario:

\- I will net about $150k from the house sale- and that’s all of our liquid assets.

\- I am moving out of state- and need a place to live for my family (toddler, wife and myself)

\- I have the following debts:

o $25,000 personal loan ($505.06 payment @ 10.65%)

o $17,000 car note ($423.08 payment @ 0.99%)

o 4k in credit card debt

o $30k in federal student loans

o My wife has an additional 15k in federal student loans

o Household income approximately $160k 

Realistically, we’d be looking at a house in the 500-600k range OR renting an apartment in the 2500-3500 range. Here are some of the scenarios I’m looking at:

1. Pay off all of our debts and rent for a year- also riding out the housing market craziness for a bit

2. Same as option 1 but hold off on student loans until we find out if any forgiveness is coming.

3. Purchase a house now, pay off whatever debt I can (probably the personal loan and CC) after all is said and done.

First post here and I recently joined the crypto world thanks to the dip. This is not my first time investing as I hold shares for multiple ETFs and Stocks such as LCID and SPCE- I mention these two as they are bleeding for quite some time and I haven't sold a single share. Moreover, all my money that is not invested is generating an interest rate of 6% annually. (Mexican here).

That said and as mentioned before there's a massive dip from what I have seen, heard and read. I've noticed that almost everyone (in this sub) is encouraging to always do a DCA and that's exactly what I did (first purchases). Instead of $100 USD in the T10 Crypto I did $100 Mexican Peso ($1k MXN which is roughly $50 USD) this last value is not even the 2% of my monthly income. 

I use BITSO as a broker and will *soon* get a Ledger as IMO is the best cold wallet out there (Systems Engineer) However, people have been here longer than I and would like to get some tips and strategies. 

As mentioned, currently doing a DCA of $50 USD in the T10 Crypto that include: 

-	Bitcoin
-	Ethereum
-	Solana
-	Cardano
-	Shiba Inu
-	USD Stablecoins
-	Tether
-	XRP
-	DogeCoin
-	Polkadot 

Note: I think I will start buying two times a week

I would swap Shiba for Binance Coin but it's not available in BITSO. Is this a good strategy? The more diversified portfolio I am some what taking more risk yet the reward could be bigger.

Rate I could buy using points changed from 2.25% to 3.65% 13 days before closing.,"On 3/19/22, I signed a loan estimate with my mortgage broker and my interest rate was locked at 4.125%. The anti-steering disclosure on the estimate showed that the lowest I could buy down the rate to using points was 2.25%. I verified on two occasions with the loan officer that I could in fact buy down to 2.25% for $23,675 additional at closing. I got a rate lock that lasts until 7/18/22 for a closing date on our prospective house of 6/14/22. 

Today, 6/1/22, I got the initial closing disclosure, and saw that it did not show me buying the rate down to 2.25%, asked them to change it, and I was informed that the lowest I could buy the rate down to was 3.65%, resulting in a difference of $350/month for my monthly mortgage payment. 

The mortgage broker said that it was a clerical error, and that while hypothetically the rate could be bought down to that level, federal regulations prevent the rate from being bought down to anything less than 3.65%. 

Additionally, I also can't find a new, less expensive home because I will lose my rate lock because that rate is locked to the home, again, due to federal regulations.

So, I either have to pay the extra money per month, or not close on the house, lose my rate lock, and still pay the extra money per month on a less expensive home. I am incredibly frustrated because this feels exactly like predatory lending. What are your thoughts on this, Reddit?

Bitcoin,The Earth is not the Sun (why I would rather not keep my wealth in manure because of diarrhea),"Do you think bitcoin is volatile?

Do you think bitcoin is tanking right now, and doing badly?

Then you good sir/madame, mistake the Earth for the Sun!

We used to think the Earth was the centre of the universe. We think the world revolves around the US dollar/fiat currency system! The price of something in dollars is the only meaningful reflection of its value then, right?

So of course, the most interesting thing about bitcoin is the price in USD. Thus you are either dirty speculator, or high brow, stink under the nose, no speculation for me goody goody boy/girl!

But the price value of something is not the value of the thing itself! Price is one reflection of value! So we need to dig a little deeper, and pinch our noses! At the end of our stinky journey, we will understand the point of bitcoin, and why we shouldn't give a shit about its price in manure! (spoiler alert, diarrhea)

The dollar is essentially like manure: its really easy to make: the government was practically shitting out money during the pandemic. It made AT LEAST 20% of all its fecal currency matter EVER, in the great diarrhea that was the Pandemic Stimulus Spending.

Everyone is shocked by inflation! Yet it makes perfect sense: If you have 1000 tons of fecal matter you produce, people want just as much as you supply. But then, the cows all have diarrhea, the poor manure deal starts to cry, because nobody needs more shit but his cows are about to fertilize the whole Ganjes valley: the value of manure is about to fall drastically (by half in our perfect market example)

Knowing how fast manure can be made, and through such moderate gastrointestinal irritation, one starts to question the wisdom of keeping one's wealth in manure!

See! the anus of the cow, and the federal printing press, have much in common! perhaps too much for the average economics/business/finance graduate to understand? perhaps if Harvard economics made economic graduates study the volume of the fecal matter, the fastness of expulsion velocity...

Maybe we would find even more ways to worship GDP, in even more complex and abstract forms!

Sure! I will need manure: manure can be very useful! as can be the USD! and I will need to sell some bitcoin until the rest of the world stops using manure to base their hard labor, sweat tears, missed time with loved ones, broken dreams,

and can finally accept a medium of value that respects all their work and sacrifice instead of shitting on it with uttermost contempt.

I am patient and understanding! I can wait until I am a grandpa for the peaceful revolution! I wait with a smile for the rest of the world to stop their addiction to worshiping manure as if it was gold!

but I must finish with an apology, to manure specifically! for comparing it to the USD

financialindependence,Levered ETFs- debunking myths,"# Levered ETFs: debunking myths (crosspost from r/investing)

📷

Hi all,

I wanted to see what this sub thought of my argument moderate leverage can be used responsibly. I think FIRE actually is a good fit for this because the focus in FIRE is living with cheap enough expenses you aren't relying on your savings during a downturn. I do believe, when all the BS stops, using 1.5X or 2X leverage can meaningfully increase the speed with which many retire. So here are some myths I argued in the thread on [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) ( [LETFS can have a responsible use case : investing (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/v1xdvn/letfs_can_have_a_responsible_use_case/iauaste/?context=3) ).

(1) **Daily rebalancing is in and of itself a cost.** This is one big myth. As AQR points out: "" Levered portfolios require an additional rebalancing process, but this does not cause any special “drag” effects beyond the normal compounding effects of investments at a similar risk level, and some additional transaction costs Moderately levered portfolios of liquid instruments can be suitable for long-term investors, subject to their risk preferences."" All these examples of ""market goes up 10% then down 10%"" that show LETFS losing money due to so called drag involve the market mean reverting within the period described, which is tantamount to saying swing trading would beat the market! Rebalancing, aside from costs involved in doing so, is not a source of greater returns, or a market timing strategy would work. There is absolutely 0 reason to say that daily rebalancing should in general lose to, or beat, monthly rebalancing. If you have a view on that, you have a view on timing the market.

(2) **3X leverage is needed to generate high returns.** I spend much of my time in the LETF subreddit debunking this nonsense. It is indeed true very few markets are high enough returning and stable enough to reward 3X leverage. But 2X leverage does dramatically increase returns, more than quadrupling average lump sum ending balance over 30 year periods from 1920-2021, and more than tripling DCA balances over 30 year periods from 1920-2021 (less time to compound dillutes DCA advantage) based on Robert Shiller's monthly data assuming a borrowing cost of the Fed Funds rate+85 basis points. One annoying aspect of the current LETF market is that 3X levered ETFs are cheaper than 2X levered ones, such that half in UPRO half in VOO beats all in SSO. But 85 basis points, roughly 45 per turn of leverage in management fees and 40 worth of spreads is quite reasonable as an approximation for UPRO. Download Shiller's data and assume higher fees and spreads if you want to stress test, I've done so a great deal. Even many of the more bearish users such as Modern Footblal in [r/LETFS](https://www.reddit.com/r/LETFS/) admit that 2X leverage with reasonable stock market returns does increase ending balance. 3X leverage is a whole different ballgame.

(3) **There is no tax advantage to leverage** This is a key point very few people talk about. UPRO has had a tax cost ratio WAY lower than SPY or VOO. This is analogous to the interest tax shield in corporate finance/private equity. They use the dividends to pay the interest costs, thus avoiding the need to distribute capital gains. Most backtests don't account for this, which arguadly would reduce CAGR of SPY/VOO by as much as 0.5%. UPRO, UDOW, and TQQQ have all managed to have tax cost ratios under 0.1% over periods they had a CAGR of 20+% vs. 0.5% for the unlevered index funds. This is key for FIRE, because with no dividiends you just keep it all reinvesting and harvest the gains when you are in a low tax bracket.

(4) **Historically US equity returns continuing is needed for leverage to work** I actually made a post in the LETF sub pointing out Shiller's arguments that we should adjust down historical stock market returns to reflect the fact that most economists don't think the US stock market performance will be repeated. But 2X leverage still handily wins in maximizing ending balance over long periods, both with DCA and lump sum, if you adjust down historical returns 1% or 2%. Moreover, the fed funds rate is unlikely to average 3.7% as it did in the past, more like 2% seems likely as a long term average, so leverage is far more likely to be rewarded.

(5) **Risk adjusted returns are all that matter in investing.** I readily admit that LETFS will always have slightly worse risk adjusted returns than SPY, at least ignoring potential tax alpha. But if you are just looking to maximize your money far in the future, and have a good emergency fund and confidence in your ability to earn enough money to support your lifestyle, risk adjusted returns aren't necessarily the most important thing to you. If you for instance are a FIRE type DCAing into UDOW and UPRO will probably get you there quicker than SPY.

I think that's enough for now. I genuinely believe that the current LETFS will be a much more important area of finance in the future, and I welcome an honest discussion about them.",finance,1654130281
investing,JPMorgan Chase CEO warns of economic hurricane: ‘You better brace yourself’,"I was initially skeptical about the warning thinking we are on our path of economic normality.

However, if a CEO of one of the largest cautioned about the stock market and economy. I am beginning to be concerned.  This week we are getting mixed messages about the stock market or even wonder if it is a solid place to park your savings.  Never have us seen an aggression that seems to last that long with no relief or truce insight. The inflation certainly has hit hard started with fuel prices.  I started seen $7 prices at gas pump and summer just started.  I plan to reduce my positions and put into more in recession resistant funds. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS and PLANS?

Below is the article from JP Morgan CEO. 

“It’s a hurricane. Right now, it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine. Everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,” Jamie Dimon [said during a financial conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ9ycHsXOls).

“That hurricane is right out there down the road, coming our way. We just don’t know if it’s a minor one or Superstorm Sandy or Andrew or something like that, and you better brace yourself,” he added.

The JPMorgan Chase chief executive spotlighted two issues he was concerned about: the Russia-Ukraine war and how it is affecting rising prices for fuel and food, and the Fed’s efforts to raise interest rates and reduce its balance sheet to tackle inflation, [according to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/jamie-dimon-says-brace-yourself-for-an-economic-hurricane-caused-by-the-fed-and-ukraine-war.html).

Dimon said “wars go bad” in suggesting that the Fed’s interest rate hikes could backfire and lead to a recession.

He also said the U.S. should do more to protect European economies that are being hurt by the fighting over Russia’s oil and gas supplied.

“We’re not taking the proper actions to protect Europe from what’s going to happen to oil in the short run,” he said.

The chief executive’s remarks come as the United States grapples with decades-high inflation, a nagging COVID-19 pandemic that has disrupted supply chains and further constraints on the global economy from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The Biden administration and the Fed have come under criticism for not doing more earlier to tackle inflation.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [conceded in an interview with CNN](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3507422-%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Byellen-says-she-was-wrong-about-path-that-inflation-would-take/) on Tuesday that she was “wrong” about the trajectory of inflation following comments she made in 2021 that suggested it would be a “small risk.”

“Well, look, I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,” the Treasury secretary said when asked about her comments from 2021.

“As I mentioned, there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I didn’t — at the time didn’t fully understand. But we recognize that now.”

personalfinance,I'm 27 and I need someone to check my spending,"Currently living at home and not pressured to move, it'd be hard to move if I had to though. Govt job making around 42k, will be 52k in a month and around 61k the following year. 

I just overlooked my finances and realized I've been overspending. I think this is because I got comfy with the amount I had in savings. I need to get some advice and just kinda see how everyone thinks I'm doing. 

Bills are about 550 a month. (Phone, car, insurance, food). I take in around 1.86k. 

17.5k in savings, I contribute 10% to tsp (retirement). Around 50k or so in crypto. 

The past 4 or 5 months I've saved nothing and have just been enjoying life. I like to golf alot and I take my brothers out occasionally as well. I'm not frivolous with my spending but if it's a small purchase like some good food or some drinks I don't think twice about spending the money.. for instance by Sunday I'll have golfed twice ($60) and played paintball ($30), plus probably drinks/gas totaling around $40 or so. 

Should I slow up and cut back on the spending at the cost of less fun? Or do you think I'm doing alright.. I know alot of this depends on my goals and really the only thing I POSSIBLY see in my future would be purchasing a house, but as a first time home buyer I hopefully wouldn't have a super large down payment. 

Also, I feel like it's worth stating that if I absolutely had to move out and pay rent I would really put a hold on all my spending, and considering most one bedrooms in my area are around 1.2k I'd really be cutting things close, but hopefully it won't come to that.",finance,1654132625

deeplearning,Adversarial GAN and free running feedback,"If one connects the output of an adversarial generative network to the input of the same network:

**Will it free run or will it lock up in a single state?**

To explain in more detail: If the output of a GAN is fed into the input and allowed to generate one picture, then feed the resulting picture to the input and repeat over an over, will it free run and keep generating random pictures, of random subjects, or will the first picture generated, then force the generation of the exact same picture, or possibly a closely  related picture and thus ""lock up"" in a fairly or exactly constant state?

Are there any papers on this? What is the term for this so I can find the papers?

Follow on question: If I inject some level of randomness in the latent layer (the bottle neck of the GAN) will it then not lock up? How much randomness is needed to prevent lockup?",technology,1654135970

I know it's my fault for letting my card expire, but is there anything I could do in case of an emergency? Like i have PayPal but tow trucks and stuff don't take that.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto as the world reserve currency,"Okay hear me out, what if instead of USD or Yuan or whatever, we had a crypto currency that was the world reserve currency. Now you might say that's not a new idea and people have talked about Bitcoin being the reserve currency. But here's the thing, nobody controls bitcoin. And while that seems great, that also means BTC or any other crypto can be extremely volatile.

What if we had a DAO that issued governance tokens to every government on the planet and using those tokens they can vote on decisions like minting money. The ""money"" would be an exchange token different from the governance token. That token can act as the world reserve, every country will use it as forex and no one country *cough* US *cough* can go money printer brrr and ruin everybody's economy or forex reserves. It will need to be a regulated currency and while that seems bad, that is exactly what will make it legitimate to the governments. But to put any regulation in place, everybody will be able to vote on it and the blockchain will ensure it's all transparent, secure and decentralized. 

Now countries can still have their own currency, fiat or otherwise CBDC or whatever so they still have control over their monetary policy. But it will be backed via the international token.",cryptocurrency,1654169429
personalfinance,Can I afford to buy my mother's house?,"My mom want's to sell me her townhome below market value, but I'm not 100% sure if this is a good idea. She owns the home free and clear (No Mortgage) and has already brought a second house to live in

She wants to sell the home to me for between $225,000 to $250,000. This is A 3/2 townhome in the Tampa area. A comparable unit in her neighborhood just sold for $275,000, however my mother's house is on the water which may make her price go higher.

I am a full-time 23 y/o Computer Science college student (will graduate in 6 months), with a full-time tech job making $40,000 a year. Or around $3,000 a month. For my expenses I pay :

\- $1000 month for Rent/Utilities (My half)

\- $400-500 Miscellaneous/Fun 

\- I have no savings right now

\- I have $8500 in Federal student loans that are deferred until 2024. For a 10 year plan I pay $150/mon

\- Credit Score 680's

The rest is either used to pay-off debt or put in my Roth Ira.

I have been doing some research and the mortgage (assuming 250k) would run me $1900-ish a month, including HOA fees, property taxes (she would transfer her homestead exemption to me), Homeowners Insurance, and some utilities. Also, how does a gift of equity work? Would the home price be $300,000 and the equity gift be $50,000 bringing the price to 250k? The research online is a little confusing. 

The home has:

\- 3 year old new roof

\- 3 year old new HVAC system

\- 3 year old new appliances

\- 5 year old flooring

\- Recently had an inspection (less than 1 year ago) in which there were only minor problems

\- Would come partially furnished 

I currently live with my boyfriend of 3 years, I of course would not put him on the mortgage or anything official, but he would be my roommate and is willing to pay $1000 month for expenses/rent. I also have a friend who would be interested in renting one of the rooms out for $500. I could also rent the 3rd bedroom out for extra income, but I'm not sure on that yet.

My mother (who is a realtor) said she would pay $10,000 for my down payment and cover closing cost. She would also waive realtor fees, although I know we can go through an attorney instead to lower prices as well.

I'm really hung up on this decision. I know this is a great deal but the monthly payment is daunting. 

Although, I am a bit comforted that my income will increase after I graduate to at least $55,000.

I live in the hottest (borderline bubble) housing market in America. Luckily I bought right before things went crazy and my house is selling for about 80% more than I payed. 
I’m under contract for another home and i like the home but it’s more than I’d ever have considered paying two year ago when buying my first home here. Only doing it because it feels necessary to move and I can technically afford it.

personalfinance,Investing into my business vs. contributing towards retirement,"Hello r/personal finance! I have been busy this past year building my own tree removal business and am currently at a bit of a cross roads.  Over the last year, I transitioned from a nursing career to purchasing a truck and chipper and starting my own company. While as a nurse, I was maxing out my roth IRA as well as contributing 20% of my income to a 403b retirement account offered through my employer. June of 2021, I started the business by taking out a loan for $145,000 at a 4.7% interest rate for a 5 year term to purchase a chipper and dump truck. Since then, I stopped the 403 contributions completely, but have still have been maxing out my roth IRA. After a year in business, I have $50,000 in a checking account and am not sure where to go from here. My monthly overhead is about $6,000, but after paying employees, I take home roughly $6,000/wk 10 months out of the year, and $3,000/wk in the 2 slower months of the year. I pay myself $2,000/month out of the business. I want to eventually buy a dump truck, trailer, and mini skid, totaling another ~$150,000. I believe the extra equipment will allow me to take home an additional $1-2k/week as I currently sub out all my log hauling to other companies. At this time, I am not sure if I should use my excess income to aggressively pay down my initial loan, if I should go ahead and take out another loan for the additional equipment, or if I should continue to save up for another year to purchase the additional equipment outright. I am also not sure if I should start contributing towards a solo-401k or if I should stick with just the roth IRA and continue to keep all of the income in the business until I purchase the additional equipment. I want to build my business and maximize my income quickly, but tree work is also a young man's work, and I want a solid retirement in place (currently 25 yo).

personalfinance,Planning on paying off my student loans after forbearance. Also want to buy a house next year. My student loans are my oldest accounts. Should I pay them off after buying my house?,"**EDIT: This has been solved!** The pertinent piece of information that I was missing is that the FICO score includes closed accounts when assessing the average age of accounts!

\----

Pretty much the title.

I have savings dedicated to paying off my student loans, which I've been planning on paying off the moment forbearance ends. However, those loans are some of my oldest accounts. I imagine that paying them off will  will impact my credit score since the average age of my credit will get younger.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, my credit score is 762 and the average age of my credit is 2 years, 10 months. My student loans are 3 years, 10 months old and 4 years old. If I pay those off, the average age of my credit will drop to 2 years, 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Will that decrease in credit age have a noticeable affect on my credit?
2. Will that lower credit score affect my interest rates?
3. Will paying them off actually help because it'll make my debt-to-income ratio look better?

During the Volcker Era as many know, rates had to rise *above* the rate of inflation at the time to bring it back down to normal. This was so, even though inflation was supply driven at the time.

Given the similarity in events, albeit worse now as there are multiple supply driven sources, is this an indication that rates will rise above inflation?

On the other hand, we are way more overleveraged than back then, does this mean the economy is more sensitive to interest rate hikes thereby now requiring as much of a hike i.e. above rate of inflation?

I have bought about 10k in stocks via robinhood, a little reluctant to buy in more since its honestly just a gamble and I dont really know what Im doing.   


The real reason why i kept 50k sitting in a checking was because I thought there was a chance to putting it towards a first home purchase as a down payment.

I might be able to buy a home in 2023, but perhaps not, especially with the way the market is. So now that that idea is scrapped, What should I do with this money to put it to use?

I currently owe $32,000 on my loan (pay off in December 2026) with a 2.3% interest rate. My monthly payment is currently 8% of my monthly take home pay (after taxes, deductions, and contributions to retirement accounts) so I can afford the payment while still setting aside money for investments and savings and the only other debt I have is my mortgage ($225,000 remaining) and 1 school loan ($6500). Based on several offers I've received from local dealerships, I could get $45,000 for the Jeep right now, leaving me with $13,000 following the pay off of my loan. Now the interesting part... what to do with those funds?

Looking for feedback from the PF community on whether I should:

a). Sell the Jeep (eliminating my largest non-mortgage debt), pay off my school loan, and invest the remaining proceeds. With Option A I'd be debt free (other than my mortgage) with $630 extra a month to invest, save, or put towards my mortgage, however I'd still require a vehicle so I'd end up driving a paid off 2008 Mercedes e350 (with 41,000 miles) until the used car market became a little less insane and my savings and investments were in a place to where I could comfortably buy my next car cash (estimating that my next vehicle would likely cost $30,000-$40,000).

b). Trade the Jeep for a more economical/smaller used vehicle and put the proceeds from the sale towards the new (used) vehicle. Provided the vehicle was in the $30,000 ballpark or under, I would be financing $17,000 (or less) at an interest rate under 4% and could comfortably have the vehicle paid off within 1 year without stretching myself or negatively impacting my savings goals. Option B would also enable me to continue driving something with more modern safety and communication equipment. 

c). Keep the Jeep, make extra payments where possible, and work to pay it off a couple of years early (ideally prior to the end of 2024).

gaming,"If you spend money on a game through micro transactions, you are the idiot.","Companies will only ever attempt to make money. Thinking about a studio as a living, breathing person with a conscious is foolish since, although they are staffed by people, the mission of the studio is to sell products. But, I’m a small lesson on basic sales strategy, it is the demand that initiates the supply, not the other way around. So if micro transactions are a thing, it is because the demand has said, “we don’t want to wait for end game content” or “we don’t want to grind, we want all content NOW!!!” If the player base simply STOPS PURCHASING LOOT BOXES, they will have no recourse other than to remove them. The only time you lose money is when you fork it over for loot boxes. But that pales in comparison to the amount the studio stands to lose if they add a feature that renders the game unplayable. 

It is very simple: we kill the micro transactions by not buying the loot boxes. I can’t believe people still complain about that.",technology,1654257184

personalfinance,Retirement account planning help,"Short story- if me and my wife have free medical for life, is HSA still useful given I already have two pensions and 401k? In the same vein, is Roth worth it for me?

I am trying to figure out the best way to save my money for retirement. My situation will be slightly different than most. I’m not posting in the vet /r because this group is bigger and more tuned to what I need. 

37yo with household income of about 300k in hcol. We max our 401ks and the rest goes to VTI etc. I have an HSA that my employer contributes $120 a month which then gets invested in Ameritrade.

I’m on the fence with Roth vs traditional 401k. I’ve been splitting 50/50, and I have not been contributing to HSA. 

I’m a disabled vet and both me and my wife get full free healthcare and still qualify for HSA (I’m not here to debate this),so I don’t see a huge value in the HSA. I could max the HSA but have been saving to buy rental property instead. 

I have a military retirement with about $40k annuity and will also have a fed pension of about the same. And I just bought my first rental property and hope to get a couple more over then next decade. 

So income outside of the 401k will likely be $80k or so a year in todays dollars plus SS when that kicks in, and then maybe 20-40k in rental money. I figure $120k a year spending in retirement. 

Any advice is appreciated.",finance,1654259865
personalfinance,Sell condo before moving to London?,"Hi everyone! Throwaway account to discuss my finances openly. Would really appreciate some advice.

I am moving to London with my wife this year, hopefully by August. I have been working for a London-based company since November 2020 and my employers and I agree that I could advance my career more if I were to live closer to the office (and in their timezone). It is a great opportunity at a top-tier company which will advance my resumé/portfolio significantly, and I have family in London as well as other personal reasons to move. I am a dual-citizen of the USA and the UK but my wife is not.

My wife and I currently have a mortgage on a fantastic 1-bedroom condo in the rapidly-growing Midtown Atlanta area, which we've owned for nearly 5 years. Our plan when we bought this place was to hold it for about 5 years, get a rental permit, rent it out, and generate a little income on the side while having the freedom to move if we wanted.

Realistically, I don’t think my employer will put up with me staying in America running out the clock on the rental waitlist for an indefinite amount of time, so I don’t think that is an option.

As far as I can tell, that leaves us with the following options.

* Move to London ASAP, pay our mortgage at the same time as renting an apartment in London until we receive a rental permit within 5-12 months, after which we’ll find a tenant and rent it out. I would have to use my savings or a loan from my family to afford the mortgage for as long as it takes to get a rental permit.

* Sell our house and move to London with around $120-160K cash from the home sale.

Here is some relevant information regarding the home and our financial situation:

* The condo is 792 sq. ft. with a 300 sq. ft. outdoor terrace area.

* It is located in Midtown Atlanta a few blocks from the subway and a half-mile from a large park.

* We purchased the condo in late 2017 for $299K.

* We refinanced it in 2021 at an interest rate of 3.625%. T


* The principal remaining on the mortgage is about $275K.

* If we sold now, it would be worth at least $395K. (One potential buyer has already given us this verbal offer. 

* The monthly mortgage payment is about $1470

* The monthly HOA payment is about $500 and includes internet, water, and sewage.

* The monthly electricity payment is about $90.

* The property tax with homestead exemption)is about $2K per year. Without homestead exemption (as would be the case while renting to a tenant) the property tax would be $6-7K per year, according to my friend who is a realtor.

* My realtor says I would be able to rent out my condo for about $2600-2800 per month in the current market.

* We will not have a rental permit for the condo for 5-12 months.

* Although we consider it a great home base, ultimately we are not sure whether we intend to return to Atlanta in the future, or whether we would want to live in this condo again

Information about our financial situation and London:

* We have about $50K in other assets (mostly stocks) and very little savings.

* I have been working for my London employer since November 2020.

* I will be earning £50K GBP per year in London, about $62.5K USD. (The conversion rate used to be more favorable…) Apparently this is a high salary for my industry, relative to London, and I’m already being paid more than all of my peers at the company.

* My work contract is for 1 year but I am fairly confident I will be employed by them for at least 2 years unless a disaster occurs.

* My wife is applying for jobs but I cannot predict how.

* My wife is applying for jobs but I cannot predict how long it will take her to find one, so we are relying on my salary.

* I am expecting rent in London to cost between £1500 GBP ($1873 USD) and £1800 GBP ($2248 USD) per month.

* We have no children but we do have 2 pets we will be bringing with us to London.

Given all of this, we have been leaning toward selling our home because it does not appear as though we will be able to make much profit by renting it out (after mortgage payment, HOA fees, and property tax), and we will have to sell stocks (or take a loan from my family) in order to cover the mortgage until the HOA grants us a rental permit.

So what do y’all think? This decision has been a huge source of stress for us, in addition to all of the other stress of preparing to move across the Atlantic.

I strongly believe that this condo is a fantastic investment long-term because it has a huge terrace, is on the same floor as the pool, gym, and other amenities, and because everyone who sees it (friends, family, contractors, movers, realtors) tell me as much when they see it. I just don’t know how much risk I should take on realistically in order to hold on to it. I could really use some sane advice right now. This decision has been made even more difficult by the volatile economy.

TL;DR: We own a great investment condo in Midtown Atlanta, we have to move to London ASAP for my career, and we don’t know whether to sell. We don’t have much equity in the condo, but we have a low interest rate. We have to wait 5-12 months to be granted a rental permit and I would have to sell stocks or take a loan from my family to afford to hold it while it’s empty. Once we have the rental permit and find a tenant, it likely will not generate income at the current estimated rental rate. Although we consider it a great home base, ultimately we are not sure whether we intend to return to Atlanta in the future, or whether we would want to live in this condo again. If we sell, we will likely fetch at least 33% ($96K) more than we purchased it for 5 years ago. Should we sell or hold out and rent?",finance,1654261527

stocks,"U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 390k in May, the smallest gain since April 2021","The U.S. releases May unemployment rate and May seasonally adjusted non-farm payrolls data.

The data showed that the non-farm payrolls in the United States were 390,000 after seasonal adjustment in May, the smallest increase since April 2021.

The U.S. unemployment rate was 3.6% in May, compared to expectations of 3.50% and the previous value of 3.60%.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said employment in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and transportation and warehousing increased significantly, while retail employment declined.

After the data was released, U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in a short-term, Nasdaq futures fell to 0.8%, S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.36%, and Dow futures fell 0.2%. The spot gold price bottomed out and rose by $5 in a short-term, recovering the decline after non-farm payrolls, and is now at $1,865.18 an ounce.

**What do the institutions think?**

Bloomberg Economics economist Andrew Hesby: The May data showed the smallest job growth since April 2021, while average hourly earnings growth slowed. When combined with a stable or better labor supply, the mix would move a step closer to the Fed's goal of cooling labor demand without economic-damaging interest rate hikes. U.S. employers may be entering a more cautious phase in hiring and compensation decisions. Cooling labor demand will leave a narrow path for a soft landing, even if the Fed will formally raise rates at its upcoming meeting

Analyst Olivia Rockeman: The U.S. added more jobs than expected in May, indicating that businesses remain confident in demand and the economic outlook. The U.S. Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by 390,000 last month, after a revised increase of 436,000 in April. Unemployment held at 3.6%, labor force participation also held steady

Analyst Lucia Mutikani: U.S. employment growth exceeded expectations in May, and the unemployment rate was steady at 3.6%, indicating a tightening labor market that may allow the Federal Reserve to step on the brakes and cool demand. The report also showed solid wage growth last month, painting a picture of continued economic expansion, albeit at a modest pace. The Fed is trying to keep inflation in check by suppressing labor demand without pushing up unemployment. The Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy stance and the consequent tightening of financial conditions has investors worried about a recession next year.",finance,1654264185
CryptoCurrency,If you're criticizing centralized exchanges for laying off staff during the bear market - what did you expect?,"After Gemini announced yesterday that they had to lay off a lot of staff, Coinbase announced the same thing today. This sucks. I feel bad for every single person losing their job.

However: I've seen a lot of criticism on here against both exchanges. And I don't really understand what they are supposed to do. When the bull run really started taking off in late 2020, everyone was complaining that KYC was taking forever, that exchanges didn't have enough staff for support etc. - and that was kind of understandable, as so many new people poured into crypto exchanges were indeed understaffed.

So those exchanges hired more people. In the past few months, as it becomes obvious we are in a bear market, the hype has died down quite a bit - look at the amount of posts on this sub! That means exchanges have  lower profits, but also don't need as much personnel. To stay profitable, they now have to fire some people.

Don't get me wrong, I don't like this and I'd love it if all those people would keep their jobs. But what did you expect? Most of you are far more right-wing than me, economically, this is what a free market does. What would you do differently if you were them?",cryptocurrency,1654264663

**China makes offer to ten nations to help run their cyber-defenses**  
China has begun talking to ten nations in the South Pacific with an offer to help them improve their network infrastructure, cyber security, digital forensics and other capabilities – all with the help of Chinese tech vendors. Reuters broke the news of China’s ambitions after seeing a draft agreement that China’s foreign minister Wang Yi is reportedly tabling on a tour of Pacific nations this week and next. The draft agreement proposes assistance with data governance, training local police, mapping the marine environment, supplying customs management applications, possible funding of data links to island nations, and cyber-security assistance. The nations which may include Kiribati, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and East Timor, are all very small and heavily reliant in internet, but are also highly strategic for communications, shipping, and a range of other international priorities.

The judge noted that IBM’s role in AT&amp;T’s choice to dump BMC, “smacked of intentional wrongdoing.”

**Hackers can steal WhatsApp accounts using call forwarding**  
Rahul Sasi, founder and CEO of CloudSEK, has posted details of a trick that allows attackers to hijack a victim’s WhatsApp account. First, the attacker tricks the victim into calling a number that starts with a Man Machine Interface (MMI) code, which can be easily found on the Internet. This prompts the carrier to forward calls to the attacker’s number who can then begin the WhatsApp registration process. After choosing to receive the one-time password (OTP) via voice call, they can then enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and lock legitimate owners out of their accounts. The attack can be easily thwarted by enabling 2FA, which would prompt a would-be attacker for a PIN upon their attempt to register the account.

**SCOTUS puts Texas social media law on hold**  
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of putting Texas' HB20 law on hold while a constitutional challenge goes forward in a lower court. The court doesn’t release opinions with these emergency rulings, just how the court ruled, so we don’t know the specific rationale, although one can assume its on First Amendment grounds. After the law was initially passed, a federal judge granted an injunction on it from going into effect, but this was overturned by an appeals court panel.

**Australia names first cyber security minister**  
Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese appointed Victorian MP Clare O’Neil into the newly created post. Previously cyber security belonged with the Home Affairs ministry, with cyber-related announcements often handled by the Australian Signals Directorate with the defense ministry. O’Neil was also named Minister for Home Affairs, so it remains to be seen how separate the two ministries will be. She previously served as the Shadow Minister for Innovation, Technology and the Future of Work.

**Leaked Conti chats confirm gang’s ability to conduct firmware-based attacks**  
The analysis of Conti group’s chats, which were leaked earlier this year, revealed that the ransomware gang has been working on firmware attack techniques which would give threat actors significant powers, since they are hard to detect, are highly destructive, and attackers can use them to achieve long-term strategic goals. Researchers from security firm Eclypsium discovered that the Conti ransomware gang was working on attacks targeting both UEFI/BIOS and the Intel Management Engine (ME) or Intel Converged Security Management Engine (CSME).

US stocks rose sharply on Thursday after investors shed their worries related to the pace of interest rate increases by the Fed. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 284 points, or 0.9%, to 33,099. The S&amp;P 500 was up 56 points, or 1.4%, at 4,157, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 280 points, or 2.3%, to trade at 12,275.

US stocks managed to return from the upheaval caused after Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) lowered its fiscal fourth-quarter forecast for profit and revenue, on Thursday, citing unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement.

Shares of Microsoft dropped nearly 4% in New York following the news but made up losses to close with a 0.8% gain on the day.

stocks,Goldman Sachs says the meme stock revolution is over. U.S. retail investors have sold most of what they bought over the last two years,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-revolution-over-goldman-165449356.html

Retail investors flooded into so-called meme stocks like AMC and GameStop during the pandemic hoping to net quick profits in a market that just seemed to keep on soaring. In 2022, with interest rates climbing and the stock market struggling, it’s a different story. Goldman Sachs analysts, led by David J. Kostin, revealed in a Tuesday research note that retail investors have sold most of their U.S. stock purchases from the last two years. And over the last seven weeks alone, $26 billion has flowed out of U.S. equity ETFs and mutual funds, which are often traded by retail investors. Rising stock prices, stimulus checks, and near-zero interest rates led investors to rush into the stock market like never before during the pandemic. In fact, U.S. investors sank more than $1 trillion into stocks in 2021 alone, the Financial Times reported in December. That’s more than the prior 20 years combined, and three times more than the previous annual record. On top of that, the “democratization” of investing due to the expansion of low-cost trading applications like Robinhood, and the birth of large online communities of traders on forums like Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, spawned a meme stock revolution in 2021.

Meme stocks are equities that gain a cultlike following on social media platforms. Typically, these stocks are targeted by retail traders due to their high short interest, which means that a large number of short-sellers—traders who bet a stock’s price will fall by borrowing shares and then selling them at market price hoping to buy the shares back at a later date for less—have shorted the stock, making it susceptible to something called a short-squeeze. A short-squeeze happens when short-sellers are forced to buy shares (i.e., cover their shorts) in order to exit their positions as a stock rises, pushing the stock even higher. The meme stock era propelled the share prices of formerly unloved, and mostly unprofitable, names like GameStop to new heights in the first few months of 2021. The video game retailer eventually saw its shares jump over 2000% to a short-lived record high of $483 by Jan. 28. Leading up to that record, the number of unique accounts trading GameStop on a given day increased from fewer than 10,000 at the beginning of the year to nearly 900,000 by the end of January, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission report.

Now, though, with a slew of macroeconomic headwinds from the war in Ukraine to sky-high inflation hurting stock market returns, the retail crowd has all but abandoned its meme stock heroes. Shares of GameStop are down over 50% in the past year to around $120, and AMC has fared even worse, with shares plummeting nearly 60% to $13 over the same period. Goldman Sachs says the rise of retail investors and the meme stock movement was largely a result of a narrative they call TINA, or “there is no alternative.” The idea is that because interest rates were so low, savings accounts, government bonds, and other interest-rate-sensitive investing alternatives just didn’t pay enough to be worthy of investment by the retail crowd. As a result, there was record investment into risk assets like tech stocks, meme stocks, and cryptocurrencies as investors hunted for stronger returns. “Since 2020, fiscal stimulus, near-zero interest rates, and record-high equity allocations supported TINA … But investors are now facing rising interest rates and recession concerns,” the analysts wrote, adding that there has been a sharp reversal of the TINA trend over the past few months. It’s now the age of TARA, or “there are reasonable alternatives,” Goldman says, and that’s reversing households’ aggressive stock purchases, which have significantly contributed to the recent stock market selloff.",finance,1654272986
personalfinance,Mother’s payout options with Teachers’ Retirement System (TRS) and Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) participation,"Hi all. Trying to help my mom understand and choose the best path forward for retirement living. She’s 58 years old, healthy, single, and newly retired after 30+ years in the public school system. 

She has a fixed monthly retirement payout from TRS that was calculated based on her years of service, salary, etc. From what I understand, this number will not change, she has no influence on what the number is and how it is paid, and it is guaranteed monthly for the next 29.8 years, which is her calculated life expectancy (per TRS). 

She also completed a DROP program at the end of her retirement, which consisted of 3 additional years of service in the public school system post-official retirement. This program essentially allowed her to accumulate income + retirement benefits, leaving her with a lump sum of roughly $160,000. 

She has the option to 1) take it all out and pay 20% federal income tax, 2) take monthly or yearly payments over a period of &gt;10 years. Of which she can dictate the amount/payout period. No interest guaranteed and assumed at 4.75% max, and 3) roll over an amount of it into an IRA, and take monthly or yearly payments on the remainder. 

My gut is telling me that option 3 is the way to most efficiently use this money. She’s leaning towards option 2 because she’s afraid to take on investing any portion of it on her own. I’m concerned about inflation and these fixed amounts losing tons of value over the next 30 years. I’d love to hear any thoughts or anyone who’s been through a similar experience. I’m discussing with her now so I can provide further info if needed.",finance,1654274585

personalfinance,In Laws Offering Large Low Interest Loan Need Advice,"TL;DR My wife and I are being offered a $200k-$300k low interest loan by her parents. The debt we have is already low interest. While we save and invest we currently do not have extra disposable income to ""add"" another large monthly payment to our budget. What do we do?

I'm looking for advice. My in-laws recently retired and sold their business receiving a large lump sum of money. Based upon past events in their lives they do not trust the government or banks and are attempting to both help out their children as well as find a stable return on their money. We have attempted to convince them to invest the money on multiple occasions but they simply will not.

Their plan is to loan each of the children $200k-$300k at minimum AFR allowed by the IRS which is currently 2.36%. This would be a 30 year loan. Their intention is to allow us to pay off debt or invest in some way and monthly each of us pays them back off of an amortization schedule. This allows them to safely make 2.36% back in interest while helping out the family.

The issue on our end is 2-fold and related to our current finances; we have no outstanding debt outside of our mortgage and car loans and our extra expendable income is limited:

January of this year we refinanced our mortgage at 2.99% for 30 years with $521k remaining on the loan. Both our vehicles combined have about $15k left on the loans also at \~2.99% (with combined payments of just over $1100).

We are also pretty tight on our budget as we just had a baby (still saving for our retirement as well as the baby's college, etc.) so do not currently have much ""extra"" in disposable income at the end of each month.

This means simply make a large lump sum payment on our mortgage and paying them back is out of the question as is investing in something relatively illiquid. We have discussed making the lump sum payment and recasting the loan but with our low interest rate and losing the tax write off at the end of the year it seems to be either a net zero savings or even a small net loss.

What should we do? Do we simply not take the loan? Is there a way we could invest the money while still having the approximately $850/month we would need to pay them back without dramatically reworking our budget?

oil,The End of Energy Free Trade,"Welcome to a new era in oil and gas, prompted by Western sanctions against Russia, that gives geopolitics an edge over market forces

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-energy-free-trade-oil-and-gas-sanctions-russia-war-ukraine-putin-11654262659?mod=hp_lead_pos5

Russia’s attack on Ukraine is redrawing the world’s energy map, ushering in a new era in which the flow of fossil fuels is influenced by geopolitical rivalries as much as supply and demand.

Whatever new order emerges won’t be fully clear for years to come. But traders, diplomats and other experts in energy geopolitics generally agree that it will be more Balkanized, and less free-flowing, than what the world has seen since the end of the Cold War.

Three likely axes of energy influence are emerging: the U.S. and other Western nations, which have used their massive economic and purchasing power as a political weapon; China and large emerging nations such as India, Turkey and Vietnam, which have rebuffed Western pressure and continued doing business with Russia; and Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern oil-producing nations, which have sought to maintain neutrality, and may stand to gain market share in the years to come.

The new order promises to make the energy trade less efficient and more expensive, potentially putting commodities at the center of the next global economic crisis, said Zoltan Pozsar, a former official at the Treasury Department who now heads short-term interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG.

A German embargo of Russian crude would likely mean that instead of Russian oil reaching Hamburg in a week or two, it would take several months to travel to China, he noted. Conversely for Middle Eastern oil, the embargo would trigger a longer voyage to Europe for crude that would have ordinarily gone to Asia. Such inefficiencies will drive up the costs of shipping, insurance, and financing that underpin the energy trade, he said.

Many predict Russia’s energy industry, the backbone of its economy, will contract because the loss of its largest market cannot be completely replaced. Western financial and technological sanctions will undermine Russia’s ability to maintain current revenues and production levels, these people say.

“Russia’s days as an energy superpower are over,” said Daniel Yergin, the vice chairman of S&amp;P Global and a noted oil-industry historian.

But the new map isn’t without risks to American power and the country’s standing as the guarantor of global trade. Since the end of World War II, the dollar has been the default currency for oil transactions, which has helped maintain its centrality to the global economy.

Leveraging the might of the U.S. financial system to muster sanctions against Russia has called into question its reliability as a place to store wealth, Mr. Freeman said.

Now Saudi Arabia, India and other developing countries are exploring conducting energy transactions in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Russia has similarly begun seeking recompense in rubles for its fossil fuels.

“We may have had good reasons, but the U.S. has politicized the trade of energy,” Mr. Freeman said.

Geopolitics and energy have always been linked, and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela have disrupted global oil flows in recent years. But since the end of the Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s, the relatively free trade of commodities, backed by U.S. military and financial might, has been a hallmark of the international system.

That is now changing. During a speech in April, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that in the wake of Russia’s invasion, it was time to redesign Bretton Woods, the system of trade rules adopted in 1944 that prioritized economic efficiency and international cooperation. Ms. Yellen advocated for “friend-shoring” supply chains of critical raw materials by deepening trade ties with “a group of countries that have strong adherence to a set of norms and values.”

Russian oil exports to the EU, the U.S., the U.K., Japan and South Korea have already fallen by 563,000 barrels per day, or 32% from February to April. A full EU ban would mean some 2.8 million barrels per day of crude and 1.1 million barrels per day of products that normally flow into Europe will have to find a new market, according to investment bank Piper Sandler.

European leaders will find it more difficult to wean themselves off Russian natural gas, which typically accounts for more than 30% of the EU’s supply and mostly comes via pipeline. JPMorgan Chase estimates that by the end of the year Europe will still receive between 81% and 94% of the amount of Russian gas it took in 2021. The EU has said it would stop using Russian oil and gas by 2027, but ending its reliance on Russian energy could come at a heavy cost.

Amos Hochstein, President Biden’s coordinator for energy security, has worked with foreign officials and energy executives to bolster alternative supplies of oil and gas to Europe to blunt the pain.

But Europe and the U.S. are operating under an additional constraint: Mr. Hochstein said the U.S. won’t provide incentives for long-term fossil-fuel investments that run counter to its plan to encourage a transition to greener energy sources.

EU leaders have said they would now accelerate ambitious plans to build out renewable energy projects as a result of the war, but concede Europe will need more fossil fuels in the interim.

Increased demand coupled with Western energy sanctions against Russia that will cut its output may lead to physical shortages of global oil, according to Joseph McMonigle, secretary-general of the Saudi Arabia-based International Energy Forum.

“If Russia is removed from the export market, there will be a global recession that kills demand,” Mr. McMonigle said.

Middle Eastern producers look poised to be winners in the emerging energy map.

Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states had been under pressure to diversify away from fossil fuels in recent years due to growing global concerns about climate change. But President Biden called on the kingdom to drill more in the lead up to war, a stark turnaround from his presidential campaign, when he called the nation a pariah.

Retired Admiral Dennis Blair, who served as President Barack Obama’s first director of National Intelligence, said despite efforts to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from the region, the importance of the Middle East to U.S. interests has been elevated again by the war.

“We need to have a very eyes-open, transactional relationship with Saudi, where we do have to go back to being their ultimate provider of defense until we can electrify our transportation and transition to more diverse energy sources,” Mr. Blair said.

State-owned energy giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, which recently overtook Apple Inc. as the world’s most valuable company, is already receiving more requests for its crude from buyers in Europe. More broadly, Saudi officials say the war has shown that aggressive targets to reduce carbon emissions by rapidly cutting fossil fuel usage were unrealistic.

“The kingdom finds it laughable that last year, several countries, including the United States, have been pressuring them to stick to [plans to zero out carbon emissions by 2050] but now are asking them for more oil,” said a Saudi official.

After rejecting U.S. requests for more production for months, OPEC and its allies agreed Thursday to a bigger-than-expected output increase, allowing Saudi Arabia to potentially pump more crude and paving the way for a potential oil-for-security deal with the U.S. and a visit from President Biden later this month.

“The Russian invasion has taught the world one thing loud and clear: We need more Saudi oil,” another Saudi official said.

Russia’s new imperative is deepening ties with Asia, and especially China, to offset the looming loss of its European market.

Such a pivot is particularly necessary for Russia’s natural-gas exports, which are less fungible than its oil, and will require a massive infrastructure build-out to find a new home. Russia previously exported as much as 200 billion cubic meters of gas a year to Europe, by far its biggest market. It sold about 33 bcm to Asia last year.

Russia has a handful of proposed pipelines and liquefied natural gas projects, which convert the gas to a liquid enabling seaborne trade, that would boost its ability to send gas to Asia, but many of the projects are technically challenging and expensive, and Western sanctions will hamper their progress, say analysts.

The most important planned project is a roughly 1,600-mile pipeline connecting Russia’s Yamal peninsula to China, called Power of Siberia 2. The first Power of Siberia project cost more than $50 billion and took more than five years to build. It will send nearly 40 bcm to China at full capacity and the second could send as much as 50 bcm of gas to China.

When the two countries agreed to terms on the first pipeline in 2014, China extracted relatively cheap gas prices. “Our Chinese friends drive a hard bargain as negotiators,” Russian President Vladimir Putin remarked at the time.

China holds even more negotiating power this go-round, due to Russia’s desperation to offset European lost revenues, said Ed Chow, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Russia could, at most, sell as much as 120 bcm of gas to Asia by 2030, and at a lower price than it fetches in Europe, according to CSIS.

Russian diplomats are rushing to counter U.S. efforts to deter Russian energy from finding a new home. Russian oil cargoes bound for India, Turkey, China and other “friendly” countries increased by more than 1.2 million barrels per day from February to April, a 146% increase, according to JPMorgan Chase.

Some Russian energy officials privately concede Russia will be unable to dodge prolonged Western energy sanctions.

“Russia was shocked at how united the West was on sanctions,” the Gazprom official said.

Some takeaways:

The graphics in the article are interesting, especially for natgas and LNG.  Russia leads in pipeline delivery, and Europe receives a mammoth's share of its natgas via pipeline.  This is a structural weakness for both regions given the article's thesis of a global, geopolitical realignment.  

Australia is ahead of the game for LNG exports, with northeast Asia being the prime beneficiaries.  Saudi Arabia doesn't even factor in this department.  

Janet Yellen's comment about ""friend-shoring"" looks like how a post-unipolar world is going to look like.  The three blocs are NATO, the Middle East, and South/East Asia.  This is precisely the same geopolitical environment political scientist John Mearsheimer has said were the three important regions of the world to look at in his various writings, as they constituted the two major population and economic centers of the world, the West and rising Asian powers, and the geostrategic resource of oil, i.e. the Middle East.",energy,1654278344

personalfinance,Becoming house poor—what to do?,"My sister-in-law “Jill” and her family (husband Jack and baby) are currently living in our basement, paying me and my husband $200/month  to help with utilities and stuff. 

They moved in because they are getting a house built and there would be a few months between when their apartment contract would be up and when moving into the new place. 

We’ve loved having them (and I think vice versa) as we take turns cooking, swap babysitting and play videos games together in the evening. But their house is almost completed. 

And interest rates have doubled. 

They are—barely—still able to afford the monthly payments, but they will be doing more commuting once they move and they will really be on the fringe. While the house has appreciated by $80k since they bought it, they say they can’t just sell it and pocket the money. I think they’re concerned about capital gains taxes..? And they would still need to live somewhere—we’d be happy if that was our basement. 

They are trying to figure out how to get a better buffer on their payments. The bank recommended that Jack get on Jill’s credit card to improve Jack’s credit score. They might be able to delay moving in and paying until September, when interest rates might be lower—one good thing about supply chain delays! They are selling one of their cars. They’re trying to be more frugal about things like eating out and travel. 

Other relevant information: they have a pretty darn good household income,around 140k together, and some college debt. They say they will be living paycheck to paycheck. 

So two questions:

1: Do you have any advice for them before they get into such an expensive house? Anything they can do to lower their payments?

2: what can we do as family to help them out without coming across as patronizing? My husband is Jill’s big brother and I don’t want them to feel like kids again and a long time ago in college we helped Jill out with a cash flow problem that made her extremely embarrassed. The other thing complicating it is that my husband’s brother makes less money, rents and lives cheaply. We don’t even think about helping him out: is it not fair for us to help out his sister?

# **Investors set their sights on upcoming inflation report as the bear market rally falters - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/03/investors-set-their-sights-on-upcoming-inflation-report-as-the-bear-market-rally-falters.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market may try to regain its footing in the next few sessions, even as a fresh inflation report looms large at the end of the week.
*****
&gt; Stocks struggled to move forward in the past week. With Friday’s sell-off, the major indexes closed out the four-day period with losses. That was disappointing to investors looking for a similar upside to the week before Memorial Day during which the S&amp;P 500 gained about 6.5%.
*****
&gt; Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab chief investment strategist, said the market’s late May surge was likely the setup for more selling.
*****
&gt; “The type of rally like we saw last week and some of what it contained looks a little more typical of bear market rallies,” she said. “I still think you’re likely to get countertrend pops in some of the more speculative areas of the market. ... But I think very decidedly the low quality trade is in the rearview mirror. I think to do well in this environment you have to be value minded. Not value indexes, but valuation minded.”
*****
&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 briefly dipped into a bear market on May 20, it has not closed with a 20% decline from its high. However, Sonders said the current situation is the equivalent of a bear market, based on the sharp declines in individual stocks.
*****
&gt; Sonders does not yet see signs that would indicate stocks could turn higher, though she says there is scope for more sharp rallies.
*****
&gt; “I think the sentiment environment is not universally bearish enough yet,” she said. She said sentiment and behavioral measures need to show extremes.
*****
&gt; # Inflation peak?
&gt; In the coming week, the economic calendar is relatively light. Consumer price index and consumer sentiment — both released on Friday — are the most important reports.
*****
&gt; May’s CPI is expected to be just slightly cooler than April, and some economists are expecting it could confirm that inflation has peaked. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said year-over-year headline inflation is expected at 8.2%, just below April’s 8.3% pace.
*****
&gt; “If CPI comes in at or near consensus, I think investors could feel better,” he said. Hogan said the market’s late May breakout helped sentiment, even though stocks backtracked in the past week. “Investors are in a more constructive place, and that can carry through if CPI is anywhere near consensus or better,” he said.
*****
&gt; Headline inflation, including food and energy, was running at 8.5% in March, and the hope is that CPI will ease from here to half that level by year-end, Hogan said.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said CPI will be affected by the jump in gasoline prices in May. Used car prices and food costs could also be factors, she added.
*****
&gt; “Everyone’s hoping for this peak inflation, but it may be more elusive and less of a peak than people would like it to be,” Swonk said.
*****
&gt; Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday that she does not see enough evidence inflation has peaked, and she is on board with multiple half point rate hikes to combat it. Fed officials are in a quiet period in the coming week, ahead of their meeting June 14.
*****
&gt; Schwab’s Sonders said the market may be concerned in the short term about whether inflation has peaked.
*****
&gt; “But it’s not just whether we’re at the peak. It’s the speed at which we come down off that peak and ultimately to what level,” she said. “Is the [Federal Reserve] on a mission to get inflation down to the 2% target? Or are they going to feel comfortable with a 3% level. ... To me, it’s where does the plane land? Is the runway at a higher elevation than it was pre-pandemic?”
*****
&gt; With the CPI Friday, traders say there is not much for the market to latch onto ahead of that report.
*****
&gt; “You have a whole week of price action, and as of right now, the price action seems ‘glass half empty,’” said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com.
*****
&gt; Redler, who follows short-term technicals, said he is watching to see if the S&amp;P 500 holds support at 4,073 and 4,000 below that. If not, it could drop back to its recent low of 3,810.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed Friday at 4,108, down 1.6% on the day and 1.2% for the week.
*****
&gt; “Traders are losing faith in trying to put more risk on to catch more of an oversold bounce, or a bear market bounce. They’d almost not want to be involved because there’s too many potholes,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com.
*****
&gt; Redler said Tesla CEO Elon Musk soured sentiment, after reports that Musk told Tesla executives he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy and needs to cut 10% of Tesla’s workforce. The comments followed closely on a remark from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that he is preparing for an economic hurricane.
*****
&gt; “You can’t have the poster child of risk saying they’re going to reduce their headcount by 10%. If they’re supposed to have a multiple for growth, and they reduce the headcount, then something has to give with valuation,” Redler said. Tesla shares fell 9% Friday.
*****
&gt; # Earnings warnings
&gt; While there are few earnings reports in the coming week, Hogan said companies could follow Microsoft’s lead and issue warnings. Microsoft lowered its guidance on revenues, citing an unfavorable currency impact. Salesforce also lowered revenue guidance due to currency.
*****
&gt; “Investors are at least looking through that. At least, it’s not a demand issue. They’re focusing on the higher dollar and what it might do to multinationals,” he said.
*****
&gt; Campbell Soup and Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel’s, report quarterly results Wednesday. Signet Jewelers and DocuSign post earnings Thursday.
*****
&gt; Sonders said weakening earnings and profit margin outlooks could trigger another leg down for the market.
*****
&gt; “We had the valuation re-rating by virtue of the weakness in the market, but we haven’t yet seen the weakness in forward expectations in earnings,” she said.
*****
&gt; Sonders said the market rallies need to show better breadth, meaning a high percentage of stocks climbing together, before it begins to turn.
*****
&gt; Another sign she is watching is the put/call ratio, which would need to be a higher level to reflect more pessimism. This ratio is used as a contrarian indicator. It is a measure of the number of put to call options. Put options bet that stock prices decline and a high number would suggest very negative sentiment in the market.

&gt; # Will There Be A June Swoon? Maybe, But Maybe Not

&gt; After a late month rally, we can say goodbye to the month of May, which now opens the door to June. Here’s the bad news, June is historically a weak month and it is actually the worst month of the year during a midterm year, down 1.8% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-1-1.png))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news though is the past 10 years, it has been a solid month, up 1.4% on average to rank as the fourth best month. But the past 20 years it has been weak (only September has been worse) and since 1950 only August, February, and September were worse.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-2-1.png))**

&gt; “June has something for everyone, as it is no doubt a very weak month historically, but the past decade it has been strong,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Still, after the big bounce in late May, we wouldn’t be surprised at all if this recent strength continued into a potential summer rally.”

&gt; Here are three reasons for optimism. First, after the huge gains last week, the 7 week losing streak for the S&amp;P 500 Index is finally over. There had been only three prior 7 week losing streaks and twice (1970 and 1980) saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 33% a year later. On the other side though, the returns in 2001 weren’t very good as 9/11 and the recession hurt returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-3-5.31.22.png))**

&gt; Second, the S&amp;P 500 corrected 18.7% before the rally last week, which could be a good thing as looking at previous corrections between 10-20% showed gains of nearly 25% on average a year later and nearly 40% two years later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-4-5.31.22.png))**

&gt; Lastly, huge gains like the 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 last week are usually a great sign for the bulls. Here are all the times it has gained more than 6% in a week (since 1950) and the future returns are very strong. Up 12.5% on average six months later and nearly 22% a year later on average is something that could have most bulls smiling after the rough start to 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-5-5.31.22.png))**

&gt; 2022 has been a rough year for most investors, but we do see better times ahead. Last week’s bottom and rally could be the start of brighter skies ahead for investors.

&gt; # Biggest Energy Names See Record Moves

&gt; The Energy sector has been on an absolute tear over the pandemic period with a 273% gain since the pandemic lows in March 2020. During the overall market downturn of the past several months, it is the only cyclical sector to have managed to retain its uptrend as it has rallied over 60% year to date compared to a 13% decline for the S&amp;P 500. Taking a look through our Chart Scanner tool, there is not too much variation in the charts of large-cap Energy stocks with strong uptrends across the board and many new multi-year highs as a result. Taking a look at two of the largest members who account for nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars in market cap, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are good examples. CVX has reached new all-time highs following its meteoric rise over the past couple of years while XOM has recovered most of the past decade's declines. Additionally, we would note that XOM has historically tended to be much larger than CVX, but the pandemic and the subsequent rally over the past couple of years have brought the two stocks' market caps much more closely in line with one another.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/053122-CVX-XOM-1a.png))**

&gt; Both long-standing staples of the Energy sector, XOM and CVX are also notable in that they are both dividend aristocrats (a group of stocks that have now raised their dividend annually for 25 or more consecutive years). That means on top of massive capital gains, investors have also been rewarded handsomely with dividends. Even after these massive rallies, CVX still yields 3.25% and XOM pays an even better 3.67%. Taking this into account, the two-year runs including dividends that these stocks have been on are unlike anything observed since at least the early 1980s. Given the record two-year run we've seen in the Energy space, it's tough to get super bullish on this area of the market now. Remember, we saw an explosive move higher like this for other areas of the market earlier on in the post-pandemic era (think meme stocks, SPACs, high growth, etc.), but once the tide turned in late 2021, the downside reversal was just as extreme. Energy stocks have completely different fundamental risk profiles than aggressively valued Tech stocks, and ultimately their performance is mostly tied to the price of oil. That being said, investor psychology and herd mentality work the same regardless of the asset class.

&gt; # Sentiment Swings Back to Optimism

&gt; Sentiment has taken a big swing higher across surveys this week as the S&amp;P 500 has experienced some upside mean reversion. The weekly AAII sentiment survey has seen bullish sentiment rebound from a sub-20% reading all the way back up to 32%. Relative to the historical average of 37.84%, that reading continues to show a depressed level of optimism for individual investors, but it is the strongest reading since the week of March 24th. As for the 12.2 percentage point jump in bullish sentiment week over week, it was the largest one week gain since the week of October 14th of last year when it rose 12.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; As bullish sentiment surged, there was a massive 16.4 percentage point drop in bearish sentiment. That was the largest one week decline in the reading on pessimism since July 15, 2010 when it fell 19.27 percentage points. Now at 37.1%, bearish sentiment is at the lowest level since the end of March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Such a large decline in bearish sentiment in only one week has pretty much been unheard of in the post Financial Crisis years. Again, July 2010 was the last time bears fell by at least 15 percentage points and before that there are only about two dozen other occurrences without another instance in the previous three months. While it was a big decline, bearish sentiment remains fairly elevated at 37.1%, but that is inline with most other occurrences since the mid 2000s whereas bearish sentiment was generally lower from the occurrences before 2005.

&gt; As for how the S&amp;P 500 has tended to do following these massive bearish sentiment shifts, the S&amp;P 500 has generally tended to move higher with outperformance versus the norm on a median basis one week and one month out. Although again performance is consistently positive, the size of gains have tended to be below or more inline with the norm three, six, and twelve months out from these occurrences.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bear-Drop.png))**

&gt; After the large moves in bulls and bears this week, sentiment continues to favor pessimism but to a much smaller degree than recent weeks as the bull bear spread narrowed to -5.1 points.

&gt; # Was that the Low?

&gt; Stocks rallied hard last week, as the S&amp;P 500 Index broke a seven week losing streak in resounding fashion; its 6.6% gain was the best since November 2020. That strong response from equities, following one of the worst starts to the year ever, has many investors questioning, “Was that the low?” While we are certainly open to that possibility, today we will take a look at why the technical picture suggests volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term.

&gt; First, let’s take a look at the technical set-up of the S&amp;P 500. While stocks have bounced decisively off important support near 3800, the index is now faced with multiple levels of technical resistance, including broken support from the February and March lows, and the 50-day moving average at 4270. Given stocks steady series of lower highs and lower lows throughout 2022, it is important for us to see evidence that this trend has turned and can hold a higher high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blog-6.2.22.png))**

&gt; Second, we remain skeptical that this market has truly bottomed without the capitulatory flush usually found at major market lows, as we discussed in last month’s Weekly Market Commentary. Nothing in markets has to happen, but whether it is put/call ratios, a stubbornly low VIX (a measure of implied market volatility based on options prices), or even just the fact that several of the nongrowth sectors arguably remain rangebound from 2021 and haven’t corrected, it would be highly unusual for us to see such a major market low without genuine signs of investor panic and indiscriminate selling. Of the five major signs of panic that we track and are often found at major market bottoms, only one has triggered so far this year in contrast to a minimum of 3 that have been found at recent lows in March 2020, the fall of 2015, late 2011 and the Great Financial Crisis in 2008-2009.

&gt; Finally, while we are inching closer, we remain in the seasonally weak part of the year and a May low would still be on the early side of the average low in a midterm year. Looking at all the midterm years going back to 1950, only two have seen their yearly low before May 19, when the S&amp;P 500 made its closing low two weeks ago. We would note though, that the depth of this correction is almost exactly in line with the average mid-term year pullback. And regardless of when we make that bottom, as the chart below shows, the gains a year after the low have been substantial with a more than 30% average return and only one occurrence falling short of a double digit gain.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chart-6.2.22.png))**

&gt; “We are anything but market pessimists,” explained LPL Financial Technical Market Strategist Scott Brown. “In fact, we believe there will be substantial opportunity in stocks on the other side of this volatility and likely in the second half of the year. However, outside of this recent rally, very little about this market has changed from a technical standpoint and that makes us wary of calling the all-clear. We believe a slight lean towards defensive sectors and away from the growth-oriented areas of this market still make sense”.

&gt; LPL Research’s Strategic and Tactical Asset Allocation Committee is most positive on healthcare and real estate and is becoming increasingly positive on energy. Within growth sectors, we are most negative on communication services and consumer discretionary and also believe the industrials sector is likely to underperform.

&gt; # Revisiting The 50/50 Club

&gt; Amidst all of the craziness in growth/meme stocks in early 2021, we took a look at the Russell 3000 stocks that were both 50%+ off their 52 week highs and still 50%+ above their 52 week lows to show some of the most volatile names in the market last May. Today, we are revisiting that club to show some of the growth names that have gotten hammered since last May but have recovered substantially off of their lows recently. Much of this craziness is resembled through Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation Fund (ARKK), which is now about 20% above its lows on 5/11 but still 67% off its 52 week high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/ARKK-Performance-Chart-060322-2.png))**

&gt; Currently, there are 33 Russell 3,000 stocks with a market cap of at least $1 billion that are 50%+ below their 52 week highs and 50%+ above their 52 week lows. These 33 stocks are outlined below, and every single one of them are still below their 200-day moving averages. However, only 12 are below their 50-DMAs. The average stock on this list is 67.3% off its 52 week highs (median: 65.4%) and 68.9% above its 52 week low (median: 60.6%).

&gt; There are a few notable names on this list, including the new-to-market EV manufacturer Rivian (RIVN), the famed meme stock GameStop (GME), the Metaverse Index component Unity Software (U), the digital platform engineering company EPAM Software (EPAM), and the EV charging station company ChargePoint (CHPT). CHPT is up 63% from its lows on May 11th. EPAM has already doubled since its lows in March. While it may not seem like much if you own the shares a lot higher, these names have recently seen massive bounces off of their lows.

&gt; # Lackluster June Recent 21-Year Seasonal Chart

&gt; June recorded average losses for DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 the last 21 years. NASDAQ and Russell 2K have fared better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. Then stocks drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon the index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small caps.

&gt; # June Worst Month of Midterm Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5245cc76a9f0c7b4d3069ea52fe049c9/3798b9cf894501aa-be/s500x750/d8c5f1f6b0aca5ac339fb5698c881480d26f8e90.jpg))**

&gt; Over the last 51 years June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks as a rule ranking fifth best with a 1.0% average gain, up 29 of 51 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.9% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In midterm years since 1950, June ranks no better than eleventh. June is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 month in midterm years. Average losses range from 1.5% by Russell 1000 to 1.8% from S&amp;P 500. Of the five indexes, none has a winning track record in June. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined more than they have risen.

personalfinance,Is there a way to balance transfer a personal loan? (or 2),"Hi, I’ve recently found out about balance transfer and was looking to transfer three things from navy federal. CC debt ($3600). And 2 personal loans (both around $1800). I get CC balance transfer offers all the time in the mail. I applied and got accepted for the Citibank Platinum CC with 0% APR for 21 months and 5% transfer fee. (I know you can get some for 3.5% but the 5% is fine as the 3.5 usually have shorter timeframes with the 0% APR. I know its possible to transfer the CC debt on the app but theres no way to do loan transfers. I called CitiBank customer service and was told that they do not do loan transfers. I no longer am interested in using the CC and am looking for other options that will allow me to transfer both CC and loan debt. Thanks in advance for reading.",finance,1654294135

solar,How to approach finance if HELOC and cash aren’t an option?,"I will say off the bat I know a lot of people argue against installing at all if cash or HELOC aren’t options, BUT hear me out. 
Today one of those sales people came to my door and pitched me the zero dollars down 1% interest rate solar installation for approximately $61k for 14.4 kW. After doing some reading, I now understand that the amount is inflated because of added dealer fees. That being said, I have only been in my home for a couple years and only have $16k in equity (based on my understanding that it’s the amount of money out of the existing loan amount, the actual value of the house has gone up significantly since I moved in). Additionally, I do not have a ton of cash to put on a down payment. My few k of savings are in stocks that I’d rather not pull right now. 

All of that being said, I live in San Antonio where our local electric utility is completely in the hole following winter storm Uri so they’re looking to start recouping their massive loss soon. Because of that, they currently have a net zero metering policy in place for electric, however next year that goes down to a 75% net metering and we have some steep rate increases planned over the next 10 years. Additionally, I know the federal tax incentives will be decreasing soon. With a current average monthly bill of $188, their finance option would basically lock me in to that rate while my actual bill would normally go up. I am pretty young but I purchased this house next to my mothers house, so even if I move I plan to rent the Home out. It’s in a very good school district so I don’t see that causing any issues for me in the future. 

Is there a better way for me to approach this? Does the situation balance out with the cost?",energy,1654310519

vet,"Kitten had leg chewed off, and their two front legs are ""stiff""","I found a stray kitten in a nest with other kittens, the mom wasn't there as I scared her off I think. I peered inside the pet house they were in and saw a dead, stiff, cold kitten. I took it out with the intent to bury, but it was still alive. The vet essentially said a lot of ""We don't knows, wait and see"". They suspect some kind of neurological trauma, like hitting their head. The kitten is now in my care, and I am keeping him warm and fed right now. I don't know if he will survive, but I would like to do my best to help him. His leg was chewed off, possibly by the mom attempting to clean his umbilical cord, or a rat got to him.

My question: What kind of issue would cause a 2-week old kitten to have their arms sticking outwards, claws extended, and stiff? Is there anything specific someone here may know of?

Thank you.

Edit. I am exhausted and cannot sleep tonight because the baby needs around the clock care. Sorry for any jumbled text.

**Update 6.7.22**

The comments here helped a lot. I do think the baby has tetanus. Also, I neglected to mention his entire body is on the stiff side, not just the front legs (good catch on the mouth aspect, u/jass611**)**.

What me (and those who are trying to help as well) are suspecting is that the baby received tetanus from the umbilical cord infection, and while paralyzed something got his leg. I have been nonstop caring for him since I found him on June 2. Every day I nurture him he improves. He is moving more, eating more, purring often, and his eyes are open. The leg wound is starting to close up, but the stiffness is the main concern. I estimate, if he does have tetanus, it will resolve in 3 weeks at most. The stiffness appears to be slowly ""loosening"".

I called another vet for a second opinion and they directed me to go to IndyVet. However they made it clear that there really is not much anyone can do for a kitten so young. So, I will continue caring for him. Then, when he gets bigger, I will take him to a vet to be examined once more.

Wish this little badass luck everyone. He is incredibly strong.

personalfinance,Should I do a cash out refinance to refinance $50k worth of debt at 9% blended interest to 6.125% into a new mortgage?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to get all of your opinions.

I currently have a mortgage that is around $294,155 left at 3.125%. I had a call with my mortgage company just now about a cash out refinance.

I would be taking out $50k to pay off the following debts:

Auto loan: $22,920 @ 6.98%

Auto loan:. $16,977 @ 7.35%

Personal loan: ~$6k @ ~11%

Personal loan: ~$2k @ unknown percentage

The new mortgage would be ~$360k@6.125% which is a horrible interest rate. However, she said compared to my current blended interest rate of 9% (**EDIT** which she calculated **/EDIT**) it's a big savings. also, after paying off these loans, I would save ~$450/mo that I would use to pay off credit cards we have. Also, she said that this increased interest is tax deductible under the new mortgage and obviously isn't right now.

Furthermore, we'd be put in their loan tracking system to be informed when interest rates drop again to refinance into a lower interest and monthly payment.

Knowing this would be a temporary loan to remove these higher interest rates and would be refinanced again when rates go back down, is this a good idea or not?

I'm half and half. I think it could be a good idea but going up 3% in interest on my mortgage sounds horrible.

**EDIT**: Thank you all. Very clear how bad of an idea this is, which confirmed my concerns. Especially interesting how they are misrepresenting the blended interest.

personalfinance,Pay Down Mortgage or Save Cash,"Curious what the sub's opinions are about this. With inflation so high, interest rates on savings accounts so laughably low, was wondering if it makes sense to use money earmarked for savings towards paying down a mortgage.

My wife and I would like to, and will eventually need to, upgrade to a bigger home. We're both fortunate to have jobs that pay annual bonuses or commissions that can be four or five figures. We've started putting some of this away to save for a house. I'm starting to think it would make more sense to pay down our current mortgage instead of saving it. 

Our interest rate is 3.5%, inflation is 8% right now. We need the equity in our house to buy our next home so it seems like we would basically be trading cash at a 3.5% interest rate instead of inflation burning our cash down at 8% and earning more equity in our home. So down the line we would ostensibly have more proceeds from our home sale. 

Am I missing something here? There's an obvious risk of the housing market turning sour and home values dropping that could hurt us. Just a little nervous to make a move on paying down the mortgage with such a substantial amount of money knowing that once it's sent to the lender, I don't get it back.",finance,1654352378
worldpolitics,"Why Russia needs to be incorporated into the EU, sooner or later","Disclaimer: I am not in any way condoning or trying to excuse Russia's invasion. Please don't take this the wrong way.

Since 2020, I have made the prediction that Russia would eventually invade Ukraine or (and) annex Belarus and I think the reason is clear to all who have been following the Russian invasion in Ukraine. 

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the borders that arised from it are an existential threat to Russia or to any state based in the Russian heartland region around Moscow. It was a miracle that the USSR collapsed as peacefully as it did. The war in Ukraine was a war more than 30 years in the making, but now it's finally here. In this post I'll attempt to explain why I think this will only be the first out of many wars in this region if Russia, or the state(s) that will replace it should it fall, is not incorporated into the EU in the long-term.

I think all of us who have looked into the geopolitics of Russia know why Russia wants Ukraine in its sphere of influence. In short, the primary reasons are:

1. Russia wants a buffer zone between it and the Western militaries.

2. Ukraine's newly discovered fossil fuels reserves threaten Russia's power over the resources in Europe.

 I will focus on the former in this post because it is permanent, unlike the latter which will eventually be outdated when we eventually phase out fossil fuels as our main energy sources.

As it stands, any state based out of the region around the Russian heartland, be it Muscovy, Imperial Russia, the USSR, the Russian Federation or any other hypothetical states, will eventually run into problems with this region's flat terrains. The fact that this flat terrains are funnelled directly into by flat invasion corridors, at the end of which sit major, if not behemoth power centers like the West and China does not help with this anxiety.

That's why Russia expanded rapidly after they got their independence from the Mongols into the North European Plain and the Eurasian Steppe. It needs friendly territories around its heartland to survive. Where it can't find them, it will attempt to create them, which is exactly what's happening in Ukraine as we speak. Those terrains give way to wars of conquest and centralization of power, unlike the Western part of Europe, which allows more states to coexist long-term with one another. There will always emerge similar states to the Russian's of our time. And with them, wars.

This is where the EU comes in. The union offers Russia a bargain: Have friendly territories around it without the need for wars. Russia can access the deep pockets of the EU and its technologies, while the rest of the EU can access its vast resources and increase the Union's population by more than 30%.

However, as you expected, there are many downsides to this ""solution"": 

1. General hostility from both sides.

2. Russian nationalism.

3. The Anglo - American bloc lobbying against such event, as it will allow for even more Russian control over the EU and by extension, the West.

4. I know we can list a thousand more of these.

That's why I truly believe that, as soon as possible, the EU needs to start pulling Russia into its sphere of influence, and eventually, the EU itself to prevent further wars. The problems are there, I profess, but I believe it can be done. Perhaps this war will lead to a situation similar to post-WW2 Germany for Russia, albeit on a smaller scale, giving the perfect conditions for Russia to merge with the EU and finally achieve the Kekkonens dream.",energy,1654352419
personalfinance,Should I minimize 401k contributions to get out of credit card debt?,"Long-story short: I was EXTREMELY irresponsible and racked up to what is now about $28k in credit card debt.

Some relevant details:

- Gross, my salary is in the $70-$75k/year range.
- To help pay off my debt, I pay $750/month PLUS 26% of my net paycheck (This % works so I can still easily afford rent/utilities and other spending money, as long as I'm frugal).
- Pre-Tax, I contribute about 2.5% of my income to my HSA and 11% to my 401k (My employer matches 50%, up until 10% of my income. Every February, I also get another 3% of my yearly contributions for the year added to my account automatically by my employer).
- My HSA contributions come out to about $80-$85 every paycheck and the 401k contributions come out to about $295-$310 deducted every paycheck.
- My take-home pay today is about $1,750-$1,800 every two weeks.
- I don't plan on touching my HSA since that's basically spending money and I know I need new glasses every which comes out to about $600/year. I also don't know when I'll need to use the money.
- One of credit cards is balance transfer account in which if I don't pay off the entire balance of ~$13k by November of 2023, approximately $3k in interest will hit my account. I plan on paying this off after two my current cards but before my card with 13% interest and $5k in debt.
- My current portfolio balance as of today is about $9k.
- I also have about $10k in Federal student loans, in which I'm planning on either having wiped out or will focus on after clearing my credit card debt.
- I'm already working a side job for a small amount of extra cash and plan DoorDashing a bit to help 

My question is should I lower my 401k contributions from 11% of my pre-tax income to help pay off my debt faster? Or should I keep my contributions the same for long-term gains? If I should lower my contributions, what % should I lower it to?

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loan v. Car Loan?,"Hello All,

I'm hoping to get some advice on paying a lump sum towards my student loan and/or my car loan.

**Student Loan:**

* Total 11k
* Interest Rate (currently 0% but will increase to 5.28% when loan payments need to be restarted)
* Monthly Payment: currently $289 until 2025 but I'm allowed to pay as little as $80 monthly

**Car Loan:**

* Total 15k
* Interest Rate 4.49%
* Monthly Payment: set at $266 until 2027

I have about 9k that I can use to pay back one or a combination of both of the loans. I already have an emergency fund so I don't need it for that. I could also use the money to put towards saving for a 45k downpayment on a house (I currently have 20k saved). Any thoughts?

Edit to add: The reason I'm hesitant is that the car loan has a set repayment schedule while the student loan is flexible. Which means if I lose my job or the economy tanks, the student loan payments can be paused or re-negotiated according to my income.",finance,1654354335

investing,Could I invest in a company with a variable interest rate loan based on the performance of the company?,"Is it legal to draft up a loan contract where I personally as an individual loan money to a company at a minimum interest rate set by the IRS. However, the interest rate increases depending on how the company performs so if the company succeeds, then they will pay a bit more at a slightly higher interest rate. Say if the company turns your $1,000 into $1,500 over a year then your interest rate would be calculated at 1/2 of the ROI so your loan would be at 25% interest. I am not sure if I want to design it so that you lose money if the company loses money as well. Do you guys think this is a good basically as a p2p platform allowing everyday people to loan their money into different established companies with variable interest rate agreements? In theory, this could be a better alternative to the stock market as you avoid the crazy volatility based on demand for securities in the market. On the company's end its great because they can expand their operations much further with the help of other people's money.

personalfinance,"Chase alerted of ""major derogatory mark"" from mortgage servicer, not showing on credit report","I was permanently laid off at the beginning of the pandemic, and entered covid-19 forbearance April 2020 (though they still withdrew from may bank through May and I paid the full amount timely until October 2020). 

There were multiple times that the servicer would call throughout forbearance inquiring about missed payments. It was always at least 15 minutes before they could confirm that the loan was in COVID forbearance and apologized for the call. 

October 2021 was the end of forbearance. Mid September, they hadn't made contact so I called and initiated the loan modification process. They said it would be 30 days, and expect to make the first trial payment in November. In October, I received loan modification terms that were not COVID modification terms (much higher interest rate and higher payments than were previously made). It took three phone calls over two weeks to finally have them acknowledge the mistake and send it to the correct department. The loan modification trial payments began in December, and the modified loan was fully executed March 2022. No payments have been missed or late. 

In Feb or March, I received a letter from the servicer stating that if I failed to contact them and bring my loan current, they would begin the foreclosure process. I contacted them immediately and was told that it was an error, and not to worry about it. 

Today I received a notification from Chase credit journey that the loan servicer added a major derogatory mark, and my credit score dropped from 820 to 670. 

I immediately contacted my servicer, and they were told everything looked fine on their end and everything was in good standing. I asked to file a formal dispute against the deragatory mark, and was told I'd have a response within 10 business days. 

After that phone call, I pulled my credit reports and saw no negative remarks, though the entire forbearance period is ""no data available"" even though the letters from the servicer stated ""Credit will report as current and active on the COVID-19 Forbearance Plan."" and ""the loan will report to the credit reporting companies as current and active on a forbearance plan."" 

I don't believe I can dispute the mark with the reporting agencies until it actually shows up on my report. Is there anything else I can be doing here? Should I also dispute the ""no data"" months while I'm at it? 

TL;DR mortgage servicer has been all over the place, alerted of major deragatory mark before it hit the credit report I have access to. I have a feeling they reported a foreclosure with a drop from 820 to 670, even though I'm current and in good standing.

personalfinance,"Buying house, figuring out purchase allowance, requesting second opinion on budget.","**Me:**

Late 30s female, not married, no kids, planning to purchase primary residence for the first time. Figuring out my purchase allowance, which is hard considering I have never owned a house before.

Live in a HCOL area (outer suburb of NYC), entry level single family house is in the 475k-525k range for an 1800sqft house from the 1960s or 1970s.

Not interested in sharing walls in a townhouse or condo.

**Income:**

$125k/year gross. I am maxed out for my employer, and do not expect pay increases beyond a typical 2-3% per year. Job is stable.

After maxing out 401(k) at $19,500/year, and paying for medical insurance, I am left with \~$6,000/month **after** taxes. I average a 30% tax rate, inclusive of federal, state, and local taxes.

**Debt:**

Student loan at $700/mo. I hope to have this forgiven under Public Service Loan Forgiveness in three years, but I am not banking on it. It will otherwise take 17 years to payoff the loan at $700/mo, so I am factoring this into the long-term budget.

**Assets:**

$235k in cash plus $210k in retirement accounts

**Projected Expenses associated with Home Ownership:**

*Routine Home Maintenance:*

$450/month (approx 1% of purchase price)

*Emergency Fund / Shit Happens*

$500 / month (for unexpected life events like medical issues, new car needed, catastrophic house damage, etc. Will invest this money if not needed)

*Utilities:*

$550/month (breakdown: water/sewer - $135, electric/gas/heating - $265, trash - $50, miscellaneous - $100)

*Communications:*

$230/month (breakdown: Internet - $60/mo, Cell Phone - $70/mo, Security system/cameras: $65/mo, Netflix/HBO/etc: $35/mo)

*Car:*

Gas - $150/mo

Insurance - $100/mo

Maintenance - $80/mo

*Food / Daily Living Expenses*

$750/mo (budgeted at $25/day)

*Fun / Party Money / Vacation Fund*

$350 / mo

**Total Monthly Expenses, Including Student Loan:** $3,850/month

**Projected Max Monthly PITI payment:** $2,150 (calculated as monthly net income = $6,000, minus $3,850 monthly expenses)

***Does that sound like a reasonable PITI payment / projected budget? Too aggressive or conservative?***

*Commentary:*

I would have to put around 200k as a down payment on a 500k house to bring the PITI payment down to $2,150/month. This seems like an insanely huge down payment, that would be more profitable to invest long-term in the markets instead. I could technically afford it, with enough left for an emergency fund, but it would deplete \~80% of my cash savings.

I make well above the average pay, but feel I can barely afford an entry-level house for the area. How is this normal???

personalfinance,What is the best way to calculate my tax benefits as a homeowner to determine if I should sell my home or rent it out indefinitely?,"I have a condo I bought when I was single, and have rented out the last few years.  

My SO and I currently rent a different home, and our rent has gone up, but not the crazy rate hikes were seeing in our area.  

We were already starting to plan to buy a home within the next 1-3 years, back in 2019.  Our area like many others have seen huge increases in value.  At the moment, it makes more sense for us to continue to rent and save money, and watch the market for another year or two, and we’re fine with that.  

My dilemma now though is my rental.  My tenants lease is up in 3 months, and I need to decide whether to sell or continue to rent it out.  

I’ve run quite a few scenarios, but the one thing I can’t determine is what the actual tax benefit it to being a homeowner.  I’m just not sure how to calculate that.  

Obviously, the tax status now is a rental property, so it’s based on income/losses.  Since I bought it, I’ve had consistent losses every year, but with rent rates now, I’d be in the green going forward, so not sure how that impacts it.  

I’m also curious how to calculate the future tax benefit on a home purchase (as a primary residence), if anyone has any info on that.  

I’m just talking about my US Federal tax filing deductions, not anything related to state.  

I’m really leaning towards selling it, but I’ve been told my whole live that you should always at least own a home no matter what, so I have decision paralysis every time I think of selling it.  I want to be able to effectively weigh out the tax benefits.",finance,1654370058

Both have the same liquidity. 

Am I missing something? What is the point of these funds and why would I use them to save for short-term financial goals? Is there any expectation that they will have better yields in the future? Or any tax advantages?

tron,Tron Ares Thoughts,"I originally started writing this in response to another User's comment on the recent material shown in regards to the production of Ares, but the more I wrote, the more I figured I should just make a post, so, here goes. 

First and foremost, Legacy is my favorite movie of all time. It has been for years now, and I just love everything about it. It feels like the perfect evolution to the original film. 

My very first introduction to the Tron universe was through Kingdom Hearts as a kid, so when Legacy came out, I was incredibly excited since Space Paranoids was also my favorite world in the game. I hadn't seen the original movie as a whole before Legacy released so I didn't have anything else to go off of. Nowadays I've seen the original numerous times and love it more and more each time I see it. 

Now that that's out of the way, I love Legacy's look, and by extension, Uprising as well. That said though, as cool as it would be to see a big change, I think there's still a lot left to explore on the Legacy front. 

Don't get me wrong, anything new at this point is good, but with how open Legacy and Uprising felt, the only other material to really go off of for the world of Legacy was the Evolution video game. I personally loved the video game, but the story for it was basically just the events that led up to Legacy itself. 

The bonus features on Legacy gave us a lot of foreshadowing in regards to Sam and what happened after his time on the Grid, and personally I'm a bit miffed we more than likely won't see what that outcome was unless Ares starts with it. 

On one of the bonus features, Sam straight up went on the news and flashed a ""Flynn Lives"" shirt, doing nothing but let people take pictures of him wearing it. I personally feel like that is such an important story piece that should be used in Ares. 

Overall I'm both excited and worried. Legacy is my favorite movie of all time for multiple reasons. The more I watch it, the more fine details I come across that makes me appreciate it even more. Seeing that Ares could potentially go an entirely different direction without so much as even a mention to the Flynn ""Legacy"" (pun intended), as well as with Leto being attached on top of it... I'm not super hopeful. 

I may be alone on this, and I fully understand that, but ya know how it goes. These are my feelings on the matter :L",cryptocurrency,1654377094

stocks,‘No Longer Sure Bets’: Tech Giants Are Dropping Bad News Daily,"* its a long article. Enjoy the read.

By Kurt Wagner 

Tesla, Netflix, Meta look to trim costs as sentiment shifts

Inflation, war, pandemic among forces weighing on industry

From Seattle to Silicon Valley to Austin, a grim new reality is setting in across the tech landscape: a heady, decades-long era of rapid sales gains, boundless jobs growth and ever-soaring stock prices is coming to an end.

What’s emerging in its place is an age of diminished expectations marked by job cuts and hiring slowdowns, slashed growth projections and shelved expansion plans. The malaise is damaging employee morale, affecting the industry’s ability to attract talent, and has wide-ranging implications for US economic growth and innovation.

Illustrations of a dour new business climate surface daily against the backdrop of a prolonged economic slowdown, a grinding war in Europe, rising interest rates and inflation, and a global pandemic dragging into its third year. In the past two weeks, a parade of big names joined the crowd. Social media app Snap Inc. on May 23 pruned sales and profit forecasts and said it will slow hiring. The next day, Lyft Inc. said it will bring on fewer people and look for other cost cuts. Days later, Microsoft Corp. tapped the brakes on hiring in several key divisions, and Instacart Inc. said it will dial back hiring plans to nip costs ahead of a planned initial public offering.

The drumbeat continued yesterday, as Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told employees the electric-vehicle maker needs to reduce its salaried workforce by 10% and pause hiring worldwide. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. also said  it will extend a hiring freeze and rescind a number of accepted job offers, citing market conditions.

Similarly gloomy pronouncements had already been dribbling out for weeks. Amazon.com Inc. has too many workers and too much warehouse space, and its business is hurting from rapidly rising inflation costs. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is easing hiring and paring expenses, and Twitter Inc. instituted a hiring freeze and withdrew some job offers ahead of a planned takeover by Musk. Apple Inc. warned in April that restrictions related to Covid-19 lockdowns in China will shave as much as $8 billion from revenue in the current quarter.

The humbled corporate ambitions signify a vibe shift for an industry that had seemed invulnerable, once offering workers and investors protection from the instability of the larger economy.

“They are no longer sure bets,” said Tom Forte, a tech analyst at D.A. Davidson, of the technology industry’s behemoths. “They aren’t sure bets because there are a number of fundamental things working against them.”

The Nasdaq Composite Index has lost a quarter of its value since Nov. 19, when it reached an all-time high. That’s even taking into account the index’s 5.8% rebound in the past two weeks.

The specter of job cuts has begun to haunt the Silicon Valley psyche. On Blind, an app that employees can use to talk anonymously about their employers, discussions about hiring freezes increased by 13 times from April 19 to May 19 compared with a year earlier. Layoff discussions increased by five times, and talk about a recession is up by 50 times.

Unfounded speculation that Meta was gearing up for a round of firings ripped through social media in May, resulting in the creation of the hashtag #metalayoff, which began trending on LinkedIn. Dozens of recruiters and employers began using the hashtag to offer alternative job openings. A Meta spokesperson says the company has no current plans for staff reductions.

Still, what was once an engine of growth for the US economy has sputtered of late. More than 126,000 tech workers have lost their jobs since the beginning of the pandemic, according to Layoffs.fyi. Netflix Inc. said last month it’s laying off about 150 workers after reporting an unexpected subscriber loss; the streaming giant’s shares have tumbled 71% since mid-November. At Meta, managers are slowing hiring for many mid-to-senior level positions companywide, and in April cut back on adding engineers with limited experience.

Twitter employees, meanwhile, are bracing for potential layoffs as the company awaits the arrival of new owner Musk, whose pitch to bankers included cost cuts. CEO Parag Agrawal jumped ahead in early May, sending Twitter’s 7,500-plus employees a note explaining the social network would start with reductions in travel, marketing and event costs, with leaders told to “manage tightly to your budgets, prioritizing what matters most.”

Likewise Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi said in a memo to staff that the ride-hailing giant would “treat hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount.” The sentiment is taking a toll on morale internally, said an Uber employee who asked not to be identified.

The shock is probably the biggest at companies like Meta, Twitter and Uber, which were still in relative infancy the last time the tech industry was hit, during the financial crisis in 2008. Things were worse still when the dot-com bubble burst at the turn of the century. The difference this time is that the pandemic reinforced how important and necessary many of these tech products are, giving them some cushion against the initial economic ravages of the Covid-19 shutdowns.

“Everybody discovered that tech was not only nice, it was indispensable,” said Russell Hancock, CEO of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a nonprofit that studies Silicon Valley and its economy. What’s happening now appears to be a market correction, Hancock added, though he also worries that some of the shine and innovation of the tech industry is going away as products like streaming services and social networking become more of a utility.

It’s possible “we’ll start to think about [tech] sort of like the gas lines going into our homes, or electricity,” he said. “That’s kind of a new thing for Silicon Valley. It’s sort of a Detroit kind of existence where cars just became the backdrop, the furniture of the region.”

personalfinance,Paying off properties vs investing,"My partner and I are in our late 20's DINK and make about 200k before taxes. No debt, have very little expenses, have new cars and do not want kids. Unfortunately very behind on investing for retirement - I have 1k while my partner has about 10k in a 401k. We have two rental properties. 50k in emergency fund/savings.

Our main residence has about 535k left with 4.4% interest rate.

Property 1 has 230k left on 30 yr mortgage at 3.5% interest rate. Currently rented for 2150.

Property 2 has 250k left on 30 yr mortgage at 3.7% interest rate. Currently rented for 2400.

After paying the mortgages and all expenses, we save about $6500 a month if we do not put anything into retirement. 
If we put an additional $3k a month into a property, we can pay it off within 5-6 years. If we pay $5k extra into a property, we can pay it off within about 3.5 years. If we invest $5k a month for 5 years with return of 6% then we'll have about $350k. 

I was thinking of making $3k extra mortgage payment a month into one of the properties and then investing $3k/month while my partner wants to just pour everything into paying off the mortgages while contributing the min to get employee's match which is about 3% of our salaries. Our goal is go part time at our jobs in 10 years. For those in similar situations, what do you do to get the max return?",finance,1654381791
Bitcoin,Parents: NEVER make a joke about BitCoin to your children. This is why:,"Mom told me in 2014 that she invested 600 BitCoin in 2011.

In fall 2017, I could no longer keep taking community college courses just to defer the insurmountable student loans. (Taking 6 credit hours or more every semester defers all student loans - public and private.) I recalled she told me she had invested 600 BitCoin. I brought it up and told her to please cash out some of it, in order to pay off the rest of my loans. The BitCoins were worth a few thousand each at the time.

When she didn't know what I was talking about, I reminded her of the BitCoin Convo she had with me in 2014. Then she said she was only joking.

That joke is worth $17,897,100 today. I resented her for it for quite some time. Fortunately, I had the federal loans discharged and private loans modified due to a successful TPD application, but still have $19,550 left in my 2 remaining private loans to pay off, at $150/month.

So NEVER make a BitCoin joke to your kids, because they could potentially bank on that statement if they don't know from the get-go that it's only a joke.

Just looking for some thoughts on order/pace of how to move forward. I'm guessing getting my interest rate on the car down is priority #1, but should I also wait some time after doing that to send out any applications for a credit card?

We really do not want to spend pointless money to PMI, but the longer we wait the chances are high that the interest rates will go up as well.

CryptoMarkets,Where are we now (a retro of 2022 to date),"Bitcoin, the dominion of crypto market since 2009, experienced a 9-week price decrease started in April, 2022, nevertheless it looks like will continue to head down to the south over the next few weeks. While it is still under debate whether equity assets have entered into bear market, almost every crypto participants, including the most radical faith believer, would agree the crypto winter has arrived.

As a normal guy who has no ability in foreknowledge, I would rather not join others to vision where the future price holds, but at least for now we are in a proper position where we can recap what happened this year:

1. The fear of skyrocketed inflation has changed Fed’s tune to hawkishness, with accelerated pace of rising Fed rate and an aggressive runoff plan effective June 1.
2. The rise of interest rate leveled the risk-free rate, making conservative assets more attractive, which could be supported by the observation of funds outflow from risky assets (cryptos, meme stocks, etc.) to Bonds, T-Notes and some other fixed-income instruments.
3. Bitcoin has shown an increasingly positive correlation with S&amp;P 500 since 2021, which was expressed to be a sign of similarity in terms of asset class.
4. The miserable Luna Crash exacerbated the downside of crypto market, remarked as the largest Layer-1 failure which wiped out 2.7% of total crypto market. Meanwhile over 52,000 BTC were transferred to exchanges, a sign of capitulation or impulsive sell-off.

Interestingly, every 4 or 5 years there would be a systematic failure on crypto market as a whole. In 2013 it was the bank run on Mt. Gox, dragging BTC price down by over 50%. 2017 reminds me of notorious ICO, deception of selling shit coins coming from nowhere which hammered the market down by 80%. It is a fact that Bitcoin has been a new-age investing asset since its birth, and we definitely were, and will be paying for the role of child caring. See link: [7 of the Biggest Bitcoin Crashes in History](https://www.yahoo.com/video/7-biggest-bitcoin-crashes-history-180038282.html)

No matter what faiths you believe in, or what you expect Bitcoin to become of, remember as follows:

1. Its nature of high volatility will not vanish but enhanced by more participants and a perception of correlation with major equity markets
2. There is a long way to the fulfillment of BTC as a globally mainstream payment method, both technically and mentally. Pseudoanonymity still opens for being improved, massive commercial adoptions have not arrived yet, an overweight on scarcity provided a fixed supply somehow dispelled the willingness to use BTC as a medium of exchange, as a currency.
3. Bitcoin will always move in a binary tree over the course of development, either be the global digital currency or be a charming, fancy tool for value storage, I am afraid it can not be both.

To all hoarders, including myself: bear in mind that studies found all mankind have a long historical record of hoarding disorder, often result in many kinds of catastrophe. One thing is to be a faith believer, another thing is to be a flaw man but with self-awareness.",cryptocurrency,1654389114

Whereas, in 2022, Do Kwon lost investors around 60billion (Luna and UST combined market value). And instead of answering questions/investigations or serving time. He created Luna 2.0

stocks,Why the fed wants to keep the market where its at,"I just had a realization about the stock market and how the fed chairmen might be thinking about where prices are. If you [look at a chart of the S&amp;P](https://imgur.com/a/hXZTTUZ), you see that we've been oscillating around this trendline since the 2009 lows. When you adjust this pace upwards for inflation, it can in a way represent society getting more wealthy over time. Thanks to human ingenuity the average person is much more well-off than someone 100 years ago. It could be argued that the 11 years before the pandemic were fairly sustainable, people were consuming but also working/being productive and contributing their fair share to the pie. The pandemic created a massive crash, but thanks to fed stimulus, an unsustainable trajectory for the S&amp;P 500, the stock market and society as a whole. Now the fed has removed this stimulus and the S&amp;P 500 has dumped back to this long-term trendline starting in 2009.

The way I see it, the S&amp;P 500 following the upward trajectory of this trendline would be a ""soft landing"". Things go back to the way they were pre-pandemic, on average people are decently well-off, increasing modestly each year. So it's no surprise the fed ""floated a trial balloon"" on potential rate hike pauses. But the S&amp;P aggressively rising off of this trendline would be a sign to the fed that our society still exists in an unsustainable condition, so inflation won't come down. Kind of an abstract and theoretical way to think about the price of the S&amp;P 500. But as a general barometer of the stock market which itself is a gauge of societal wealth, it makes sense. So what I would like to see is for us to maintain a modest trend upwards along this trendline over the next months and years, which would be a good sign that society has returned to a period of sustainable growth.",finance,1654408769

**Abstract**:  
Some of the most common machine learning pipelines involve manipulation of tabular data. The current state-of-the-art solution for tabular modeling is the TabTransformer by Amazon from 2020. It incorporates a Transformer block to track relationships between categorical features and makes use of a standard multilayer perceptron to output its final logits. We propose modifications outperforming it on binary classification tasks for three benchmark datasets with more than 1% AUROC gains. We process categorical embeddings with an attention mechanism and then concatenate them with continuous values to be fed through multiple layers of gated MLP - a neural network originally introduced for language tasks.",technology,1654413236

investing,Fidelity | Questions Re: Buying Bonds,"I am working to transition to an even mixture of stocks and bonds. Naively, I stumbled upon Fidelity's bond search. This seems like a neat tool, but I have not found bonds very intuitive.

As a specific example, I am looking at a Federal Farm CR BKS Bond with a 2.830 coupon that pays semi-annually. The last coupon is on 06/29/2023. The bond ask price is $100.48.

&amp;#x200B;

* What is the coupon interest paid on?  For example, I could imagine the bond I am buying for $100.48 was a $10 bond (i.e. I would get 2.830% on $10 for two more interest periods). Or is it 2.830% of ask price I buy the bond for? -- Again, totally naive here!
* Within fidelity, how does it work when the bond reaches maturity? Is the principal returned immediately? Or do you need to take the bond to the seller to get the principal back?",finance,1654428976
personalfinance,Final paycheck fed tax rate went from 2.7% to 17.5%. How TF?,"I was recently terminated from my employer after reporting harassment. I have just received a final payout well beyond what I expected (I thought my pay only went through the day I was fired, and that I had one sick day left) but I am noticing the federal taxes taken out are proportionally WAY higher than usual. 

My usual gross take home for two weeks is $1660.50 and my federal taxes withheld are $45.75 which is 2.7%. For this massive unasked-for lump sum payment of $5996.50 (almost 4x my normal salary) my fed taxes are $1051.76, or 23 TIMES my normal federal tax rate. This means I owed 17.5% of my salary to federal tax payments instead of the usual 2.7%...

My YTD income is $21K after this payment of nearly $6K. My YTD tax payments are ~$1700 after this $1000 single tax payment. That means for the other $15K of my income I only owe $700 (4.6%), but for this $6K I owe $1000 (17%). That makes no sense to me.

U.S. employers in the technology sector cut nearly nine times more jobs in May than in the first four months of the year as rising inflation and slowing demand force companies to cut corners. Though overall layoffs in the country reported by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas on Thursday fell 14.7% in May from April, thanks to strong demand in the labor market, the technology sector cut 4,044 jobs, up from the 459 between January and April. It is the highest monthly total since December 2020 when tech companies cut as many as 5,253 jobs. ""Many technology startups that saw tremendous growth in 2020, particularly in the real estate, financial, and delivery sectors, are beginning to see a slowdown in users, and coupled with inflation and interest rate concerns, are restructuring their workforces to cut costs,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.

The impact of the Ukraine crisis, a four-decade high inflation and rising interest rates has led to forecast cuts by companies such as Snap Inc and Microsoft, while others like Meta Platforms Inc have slowed hiring to rein in costs. Fintech companies also announced 268% more job cuts in May than in the first four months of 2022, the report from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas said.",finance,1654434526

personalfinance,Pay off house with 401k?,"Not for me, but for my parents, their 401k is rather small...only about enough to pay off what they owe on their house. They're in their 60s, but my father is a relatively high earner (&gt;$120k) and is looking at around $3k/mo from SS in 4 years (more if he waits longer) plus a tiny pension at ~$400/mo (plus my moms SS, which is much smaller than my fathers, but not negligible).  

They would save about $1300/mo with the house paid off (interest on their mortgage is currently almost $600/mo).  

Trying to help them make the best choice for their situation, I hate to see them drain their 401k but the alternative is average growth that probably isn't beating the interest on their mortgage right now. They're also worried the market could drop even more and leave them with even less, with not enough time to recover the losses.  

Any thoughts on whether liquidating their 401k to pay off their house is a sound move for them?

stocks,"I Bonds, I Bonds, I Bonds","New advice for investors. Although this forum is about investing in stocks, I just found out about U.S. Treasury I Bonds. They are a no risk investment with a high interest return. I'm surprised that I didn't find out about these sooner. With the stock market fluctuating or even having a downturn and with inflation and even cryptocurrencies having taken a dive, I Bonds are a wonderful opportunity. 

The Treasury Department says the following about I Bonds.

""I Bonds can be purchased through October 2022 at the current rate.  That rate is applied to the 6 months after the purchase is made.  For example, if you buy an I bond on July 1, 2022, the 9.62% would be applied through December 31, 2022.  Interest is compounded semi-annually.

A Series I savings bond is a security that earns interest based on both a fixed rate and a rate that is set twice a year based on inflation. The bond earns interest until it reaches 30 years or you cash it, whichever comes first.

For the first six months you own it, the Series I bond we sell from May 2022 through October 2022 earns interest at an annual rate of 9.62 percent. A new rate will be set every six months based on this bond's fixed rate (0.00 percent) and on inflation.

In a calendar year, you can acquire:

up to $10,000 in electronic I bonds in TreasuryDirect

up to $5,000 in paper I bonds using your federal income tax refund

The limits apply separately, meaning you could acquire up to $15,000 in I bonds in a calendar year""

coal,Surface mining reclamation,"The history of coal mining in the US is long and interesting. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 or SMCRA is a federal law that seeks to control the effects of surface coal mining in the US. Let's face the truth, there is no clean way to mine coal. However, coal has been of immense importance to US industry and economy.

In the old days the effects of mining were negligible. But the massive industrialization of surface mining was made possible with steam and diesel coal shovels in the 1930's and later. A few states started to make laws regulating surface mining in the 1940's. The use of coal for producing electricity grew a lot in the 60's and 70's.  In 1963, 33% of American coal came from surface mines, but by 1973 that figure had increased to 60%. That this happened during just 10 years is incredible. 

Two out of every 3 acres of reclaimed surface  mining land has been cultivated into grassland. The general aim with reclamation is to bring the land back to its originak condition as far as possible, bit this aim is often extremely costly. The second best option is to plant the land after sculpting it so it remains stable.

The other side of the story is that far from all abandoned surface mining land has been reclaimed. A lot more needs to be done.

The main dilemma is to mine coal with as little harm to the environment as possible, while recognizing the huge importance of coal mining to coal states and coal areas.",energy,1654448262
Bitcoin,List of big things to forward to before the next bitcoin halving. You must accumulate now.,"&amp;#x200B;

* **Bi-partisan crypto bill** by the GOP's Cynthia Lummis and the Democrat's Kristen Gillinbrand (this is a person who voted against bailing out Wall Street &amp; banks circa 2008). The bill should be out this month, but probably won't get a vote until the 118th Congress begins next year. My belief is that after regulatory clarity, bitcoin will absorb TradFi and trust rapidly. Governments won't be able to control programmable money like this and it will run wild. Anything unfavorable in any bills will get programmed around and that'll be a wrap
* **Taproot Support.** Praise the lord, because we already have 75%+ nodes supporting it, and Taproot addresses, signatures, and scripting are necessary to unleash the security and innovation we need to begin onboarding institutions, governments, and individuals en masse
* **TARO** (taproot asset representation overlay). This means stablecoins, products, services, NFT collectibles, tokenized securities, and anything else that you can assign value. It's difficult to stress the absurd liquidity and power this can bring the Bitcoin Network. All of this stuff will ultimately get settled in bitcoin. Why? Because bitcoin is a payment network that only bitcoin travels on. Meaning anything built on or traveling above bitcoin's base layer gets settled in BTC. This is how we *""bitcoinize the dollar""* flipping the dynamic we're so accustomed to on exchanges, where bitcoin is settled in US dollars. This will fire a major shot across the bow spurning a circular economy war. TARO is also cool because the upgrade to wallets is so minimal. Of course none of this is good news for centralized exchanges
* **The Merge**. This will set that protocol rapidly on its path towards centralization and self-immolation. Liquid staking derivative platforms will within 1 year acquire the network effects and stakes necessary to capture over 50% of the network and control it forever unless hard-forked, creating several problems itself because of L2, bridges, and sidechains obviously. If it's not a single platform acquiring the network, it will be two of them colluding. The decentralized autonomous organizations that run these platforms are made of TradFi and erstwhile hegemons. Expect them to utilize carry trades (low interest cash borrowing), use it to buy the crypto, stake it, and use their staking derivatives to short the crypto, creating near delta-neutral positioning. Remember, if you're not staking, you're being diluted by whatever the staking APY is. I suspect this inflation will match the USD's traditionally (4% or so). Just another reason why fixed monetary policy (bitcoin) and PoW are important
* **SEC regulation**: this means securities designations for much of the space which will damage centralized exchanges as much as VC's and (expletive)coins themselves. This is the s-curve adoption shakeout we bitcoiners have been warning about. It will help end the above system we talked about even faster
* **Full-blown LiFi** (Lightning Finance). If I can send you bitcoin and you get stablecoins on the other end; or you send someone stablecoins and they get milk, then you can see how most people using the Bitcoin Network won't know they're using the network. They won't see or understand what's happening in the background anymore than they do Visa when buying a concert ticket, or HTTP when clicking through a website. You don't have to price things at the store in sats people. It doesn't matter what they're priced in. I can see several payment processors bypassing traditional discrete payment networks (like Visa or PayPal) and leveraging the LN. I expect banks, the traditional payment networks themselves, and even governments to use it. One major chartered bank is already in talks to issue fiat (not stablecoins, but digital fiat) on the LN. It's pretty cool to know the LN will connect everybody in the world, and to get started all that's needed is downloading a free wallet
* **Hyperinflation.** It's unavoidable. We're at the end of the debt cycle. The USD is trapped. You can't raise interest rates enough because the debt is too high (over $30T) making the interest paid too high. Foreign demand for Treasuries peaked years ago. Supply chains are broken, many for the rest of this decade. Energy inputs can't be reigned in, not just because of sanctions which cause an immediate impact, but because even when those are gone, the chronic underinvestment in exploration/extraction will take years to fix with proper investment (even if we made a sweetheart deal with Venezuela). And lastly, inflation is high everywhere you look. This is what Robert Triffin predicted back in the 1960s for an inflationary world reserve currency--an eventual doom vortex when the currency got trapped between low rates, inflation, debt, and falling foreign demand. Several countries have currencies which are more volatile than BTC is (Turkey, Iran, Argentina, Cuba, much of Africa, etcetera). Is Japan next? What I know is it's climbing the ladder, and when BTC is more stable than major currency pairs are, with longterm bias to the upside, we'll see a credit market rapidly develop around bitcoin collateral globally. Point is, the capital flight release valve in a hyper event is pretty obvious: Bitcoin. The USD isn't going away just yet, but stopping inflation doesn't mean prices go down, it simply means prices stop going up. Thankfully BTC will be there to do whatever you need it to do: issue new assets, collateralize, lend, borrow, save, send, or spend. The new global reserve asset

Seriously though, this shit is going to disappear into the internet stack. And the sooner we're the internet of money, the sooner the price becomes apparent:

solar,HELP: Vivint VS ADT Solar - Need help with understanding!,"Hi guys, 

I am completely new to the whole solar panel scene. Before that, I would always admire my neighbors having solar panels just because they look so cool and high-tech. 

I purchased my first home in October of 2021 and long story short I am getting my roof and siding replacement by my insurance company (woohoo!)

Anyway, here is my dilemma. 

Vivint came to my door and explained to me this ""great"" deal. I signed up with them after I was able to get the monthly fixed rate I wanted. I advised the sales rep that I will be contacting other companies to get different offers. He said that is great and will price match.

I called ADT Solar. I was amazed they purchased Sunpro but not only that, ADT has been around for like 150+ years. That is one thing that stood out for me. Their reputation. I know if I have a problem in the future, I'll be able to contact them directly and know I won't get the run around with a big company like this (hopefully).  


So now this is what they are offering:

&amp;#x200B;

**Vivint** is offering QCELL 400 solar panels (12), normal races, and enphase. ( i can advise of specifics if asked). They are offering me a 25-year loan with a 25-year warranty. The company that's installing the panels is ""Freed0m Forev3r"" It appears they are local. I am looking at $70 a month. They are also promising that the first 18 months is strictly 70 dollars and after that, I have to provide them my federal credit to keep it at $70. 

Here's the thing, Vivint is also keeping my 26% state tax credit. They said that is deducted from their price. I asked the Vivint sales rep to see what he thought. The Vivint rep advised that it is VERY HARD to retrieve the 26% tax credit and that FREEDOM is taking a risk doing that?

**ADT** is offering QCELL 360 solar panels (13). Same specs as Vivint I believe. They are offering me a 20-year loan with 3.99 interest after discounts and it will be around $69 a month. From what I've heard, ADT purchased Sunrun but it is still an ADT company now. ADT also offered to replace my whole electrical panel (because it's old. Vivint is also offering this.) 

ADT is offering to help me get the state tax credit and do all the paperwork for me. If I do retrieve this amount, I can use it to bring up my monthly rate lower for electricity. 

ADT sales rep told me Vivint is bullshitting. You can easily get that 26 state tax and keep the funds. 

I've been so stressed thinking about this. On the other hand, Vivint is offering me a better solar panel but ADT is offering me a cheaper price and 13 panels. Both will replace my main electrical panel. In the long run, it would be beneficial for me to go with ADT if I'm going to get my state compensation right?

# Net losses

If you look at historical data on the U.S. economy, you often notice that [something changed](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/Jj6mQ0EfUngS04o-DVMFuw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRkfxZ-P0TpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOS8wMi8yNC9vcGluaW9uL2luY29tZS1pbmVxdWFsaXR5LXVwcGVyLW1pZGRsZS1jbGFzcy5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMjA2MDUmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9NjMyNjAmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xMDQzMDIyMjQmc2VnbWVudF9pZD05NDI4NyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9MzA4YzAyMjg3MjdiNDUxMjliYTc3ZDRlNWZhMDBkMjJXA255dEIKYph-kZxi2VRoIFIVY2hyaXN2YWxlcmFAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAA) in the late 1970s or early ’80s. Incomes started growing more slowly for most workers, and inequality surged.

David  Gelles — a Times reporter who has been interviewing C.E.O.s for years —  argues that corporate America helped cause these trends. Specifically,  David points to Jack Welch, the leader of General Electric who became  the model for many other executives. I spoke to David about these ideas,  which are central to his new book on Welch (and to [a Times story based on it](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/hQbzedYMLbVpPXkX21gUFQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRkfxZ-P0TgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yMS9idXNpbmVzcy9qYWNrLXdlbGNoLWdlLWNlby1iZWhhdmlvci5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMjA2MDUmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9NjMyNjAmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xMDQzMDIyMjQmc2VnbWVudF9pZD05NDI4NyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9MzA4YzAyMjg3MjdiNDUxMjliYTc3ZDRlNWZhMDBkMjJXA255dEIKYph-kZxi2VRoIFIVY2hyaXN2YWxlcmFAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAA)).

**How do you think corporate America has changed since the 1980s in ways that helped cause incomes to grow so slowly?**

For  decades after World War II, big American companies bent over backward  to distribute their profits widely. In General Electric’s 1953 annual  report, the company proudly talked about how much it was paying its  workers, how its suppliers were benefiting and even how much it paid the  government in taxes.

That  changed with the ascendance of men like Jack Welch, who took over as  chief executive of G.E. in 1981 and ran the company for the next two  decades. Under Welch, G.E. unleashed a wave of mass layoffs and factory  closures that other companies followed. The trend helped destabilize the  American middle class. Profits began flowing not back to workers in the  form of higher wages, but to big investors in the form of stock  buybacks. And G.E. began doing everything it could to pay as little in  taxes as possible.

**You** [**make clear**](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/fxJxT8-scIWdYVjaa4W-gA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRkfxZ-P0TeaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy8yMDIyLzA1LzMxLzExMDIxNjU0MTMvZGlkLWphY2std2VsY2gtYnJlYWstY2FwaXRhbGlzbT9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjIwNjA1Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTYzMjYwJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTA0MzAyMjI0JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9OTQyODcmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPTMwOGMwMjI4NzI3YjQ1MTI5YmE3N2Q0ZTVmYTAwZDIyVwNueXRCCmKYfpGcYtlUaCBSFWNocmlzdmFsZXJhQGdtYWlsLmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~)  **that many other C.E.O.s came to see Welch as a model and emulated him.  So why wasn’t there already a Jack Welch before Jack Welch, given the  wealth and fame that flowed to him as a result of his tenure?**

This was one of those moments when an exceptional individual at a critical moment really goes on to shape the world.

Welch  was ferociously ambitious and competitive, with a ruthlessness that  corporate America just hadn’t seen. In G.E., he had control of a large  conglomerate with a history of setting the standards by which other  companies operated. And Welch arrived at the moment that there was a  reassessment of the role of business underway. The shift in thinking was  captured by the economist Milton Friedman, who [wrote](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/7yAeIuPDNm6h2OLdCY6ygw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRkfxZ-P4QFAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzE5NzAvMDkvMTMvYXJjaGl2ZXMvYS1mcmllZG1hbi1kb2N0cmluZS10aGUtc29jaWFsLXJlc3BvbnNpYmlsaXR5LW9mLWJ1c2luZXNzLWlzLXRvLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIyMDYwNSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD02MzI2MCZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTEwNDMwMjIyNCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTk0Mjg3JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD0zMDhjMDIyODcyN2I0NTEyOWJhNzdkNGU1ZmEwMGQyMlcDbnl0QgpimH6RnGLZVGggUhVjaHJpc3ZhbGVyYUBnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAAA~) in The Times Magazine that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.”

**Was  Welch’s approach good for corporate profits and bad for workers — or  ultimately bad for the company, too? You lean toward the second answer,  based on G.E.’s post-Welch struggles.

I’m left  wondering whether Welchism is a zero-sum gain for shareholders or bad  for everyone.**

Welch  transformed G.E. from an industrial company with a loyal employee base  into a corporation that made much of its money from its finance division  and had a much more transactional relationship with its workers. That  served him well during his run as C.E.O., and G.E. did become the most  valuable company in the world for a time.

But  in the long run, that approach doomed G.E. to failure. The company  underinvested in research and development, got hooked on buying other  companies to fuel its growth, and its finance division was badly exposed  when the financial crisis hit. Things began to unravel almost as soon  as Welch retired, and G.E. announced last year it would break itself up.

Similar  stories played out at dozens of other companies where Welch disciples  tried to replicate his playbook, such as Home Depot and Albertsons. So  while Welchism can increase profits in the short-term, the long-term  consequences are almost always disastrous for workers, investors and the  company itself.

**Welch was responding to** [**real problems at G.E.**](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/G2gsT1sOLT3OBpRkGbL0sQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRkfxZ-P0TjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMTk4NS8wNS8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy93aHktamFjay13ZWxjaC1pcy1jaGFuZ2luZy1nZS5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMjA2MDUmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9NjMyNjAmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xMDQzMDIyMjQmc2VnbWVudF9pZD05NDI4NyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9MzA4YzAyMjg3MjdiNDUxMjliYTc3ZDRlNWZhMDBkMjJXA255dEIKYph-kZxi2VRoIFIVY2hyaXN2YWxlcmFAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAA)  **and the American economy in the 1970s and early ’80s. If his cure  created even bigger problems, what might be a better alternative?**

An  important first step is rebalancing the distribution of the wealth that  our biggest companies create. For the past 40-plus years we’ve been  living in this era of shareholder primacy that Friedman and Welch  unleashed. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage remained low and is still  just $7.25, and the gap between worker pay and productivity kept  growing wider.

There  are some tentative signs of change. The labor crisis and pressure from  activists has led many companies to increase pay for frontline workers.  Some companies, such as PayPal, are handing out stock to everyday  employees.

But  it’s going to take more than a few magnanimous C.E.O.s to fix these  problems. And though I know it’s risky to place our faith in the  government these days, there is a role for policy here: finding ways to  get companies to pay a living wage, invest in their people and stop this  race to the bottom with corporate taxes.

American  companies can be competitive and profitable while also taking great  care of their workers. They’ve been that way before, and I believe they  can be that way again.

defi,"Is anyone else ""short"" alts? Or is now the worst time to short?","Very important questions in this post:

FOR CONTEXT:

I am DCAing into btc and USDC everyday. 50/50

I did take out debt against my collateral (btc and usdc) and I took out the debt in the form of AVAX and ETH.

Reason for shorting AVAX: I'm using the borrowed AVAX to leverage farm LPs.

\- If AVAX drops, my LP value drops, but it should be a less volatile drop because half the pool is stablecoin. The AVAX debt goes down in terms of USD, and my LP will be worth more than the debt.

\- If AVAX goes up, my debt will go up, but the value of my LP should still be more valuable than the debt if it accumulates rewards overtime and compounds.

QUESTIONS:

Is this a sound conclusion? Or is this super dangerous?

Also: reason for shorting ETH: I think eth will bleed with the market.

BUT: if people like me are shorting and thinking the market will continue to go down, does that truly mean we are CURRENTLY at the BOTTOM of the market and its only up from here? Since the market tends to trick retail investors like myself?

OR: Do you think continued downwards movement will prevail in the following months BECAUSE of external factors like the FED, recession, war, etc?

DO we have a LEGITIMATE reason to be bearish right now, and do you truly think that the market will continue to go down? Or do you think we have reached PEAK FEAR and now is the perfect time to be aggressively loading up on risk-on assets like bitcoin and ethereum?",cryptocurrency,1654452200

personalfinance,Looking for possible advice on either taking out a new credit card or a personal loan to help pay off some credit debit,"I really need some advice. Should I try to take out a personal loan from somewhere to help pay off my credit card debt which I am almost always maxing out on like 2 cards, or just take out a new card hoping I can just use that while paying off my other ones? I am on top of payments so far but I know it's just a matter of time before they are maxed out between paychecks or something and I can't keep up. If the personal loan is big enough can I even use the money maybe set aside from it to help pay itself off? For example pay a lot of my cards off (might try to spread out some payments in hopes of raising my okay credit score), and use the loan to help keep the payments on my cards going while also some of the loan to pay the loan off? Like the monthly payment of the loan could be about how much I pay off on all cards each month. Quick math says about 8000 will really be able to knock a lot off my debt away and some things on credit karma says I might be able to get a 11000 loan. I know it seems like I have already convinced myself to do the personal loan but I don't know which one of the things credit karma recommends I should try and is a personal loan worth it? The interest rate is always the scary thing and I don't want to I guess get fucked over once I start the process. But also maybe stupid question, can I pay back the loan early and like end it? Can I do many monthly payments at once? The amount of money I said I might take out I am fine to change as well just really any advice would be great please.

Tldr: take out new credit card to use instead of others and try to pay others off, or get a personal loan and set up scheduled payments to pay off cards and use loan itself to help pay itself off if I can get the predicted amount credit karma says places might give me. What places should I trust if I take out a loan?",finance,1654453584

personalfinance,"Help me think through rebalancing 401(k) ""in these challenging times""","Hi, all  -- thanks for any advice/insight in advance.

For context, I am 50 years old and have been investing in my 401K for decades. I am not near retirement, but closer than most here, I imagine. If I can retire early by 60, with a yearly income of $200K+, that would be ideal, but may not be able to -- current investment in 401K is about $1.3M shy to hit that, but do have that in house equity which may be helpful down the road. 

I plan to continue to max out 401K and current in-plan Roth conversion (in-plan Roth conversion was only offered a few years ago, and started allocating money to it to diversify tax hit on withdrawls), including catch-up contribution max outs because I am officially very old.

I've invested in a wider spread of funds to diversify across index fund (domestic and international), large/mid/small cap funds, and some stable investments, but have a feeling I can consolidate holdings for both simplification and improving returns and fees. 

With a 10 to 15 time horizon, I should also be thinking about rebalancing a little more into more stable bonds/cash vehicles to protect the investment -- I've always been fairly aggressive, with about a 92% overall allocation in stock, the rest in bond/short term investments. I'd like to still be fairly aggressive, but I do need to start thinking about underlying investment protection as I get nearer to retirement age.

There is also the current environment of inflation and bond yields bouncing around -- shifting more into bonds right now in a volatile market may not be great right now until we see a little more stability given real possibility of continued interest rate increases and inflation (which decrease bond yields) - perhaps there is a better asset to think about besides bonds in the near term?

Finally, there is a very large proportion of my 401K in a FAANG stock -- ~25% of my holdings across both 401K and Roth conversions -- from employer matching. This is absolutely antithetical to investing diversification, but this is a strategy that has paid off as this stock has appreciated far more than the S&amp;P in the last 10 years (870% growth versus 194% of S&amp;P). The stock has been trading sideways for about a year, but is about to imminently split (may be obvious which stock this is by now).

So with all of that, here are the allocation % in Fidelity 401K -- any advice on how I should be thinking about rebalancing/other considerations are vastly appreciated. Also, any advice on continuing to fund Roth in-plan conversion versus other investment approaches is welcome.

Assume $1M in total balance, 6% of total in Roth conversion with the rest in 401K, with the following fund allocation % across both 401K and Roth conversion (with expense ratios in parens):

Vanguard Inst. 500 Index Trust- 28.6% (0.012%)

Company matching stock - 20.6%

Vanguard Total International Index Trust - 10.8% (0.063%)

Vanguard Target 2035 Find -- 8.4% (0.0425%)

Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund (Large Cap) - 8.4% (0.12%)

State Street Large Cap Growth Index Trust (Large Cap) - 0.1% (0.025%) - this was from another index fund that was retired and follows Russell 1K Growth index.

State Street Large Cal Value Index - 5.9% (0.027%)

American Beacon Small Cap Value - 6.8% (0.8%)

Vanguard Explorer Fund Admiral - 4.9% (0.29%)

Vanguard Institutional Total Bond Index Trust - 4.6% (0.027%)

Vanguard Retirement Savings Trust II - 1% (0.24%)

I know nothing about finance, so I apologize if this is a no brainer or dumb question, please be kind.

I had student loans through Sallie Mae that I refinanced through my bank Jan 2020 with my mom as a cosigner. The plan was a 15 year fixed rate at 5.73%. I still have 155 months of payments left.

Now, my bank is advertising refinancing loans with fixed rates as low as 4.68% for 15 years or 4.47% for 10 years. I make enough now where I shouldn't need a cosigner and have very good credit. This advertisement is specifically sent as a preappoval advertisement? Like a, ""You're preapproved! Apply now!"" but idk what those mean anyway lol.

Basically, what are my options? Am I able to call my loan provider to ask for a lower rate or do I reapply? Is it worth the potential of an extra percent off? Ideally I'd like to lower the monthly payment AND the total amount I pay, but I cannot afford to make a higher monthly than I am currently.

I've seen it OVER, and OVER, and OVER, and OVER again this subreddit. Yet somehow I've been told this is a conservative and libertarian circle jerk subreddit (LMAO).



However, when I do the math, it doesn't really match with reality. Here are the total of the wages and compensations that the CEOs of some of the largest corporations in the US. As well as the amount of people these companies employ in the US and how much the yearly income of the employees' salary would increase if we got rid of the CEO's pay. 


I am fully aware that the argument is not to get rid of CEOs, at least not outside of some subreddits and breadtube, but rather that lowering their pay could significantly increase the pay of the average worker. Or at least it is implied that it would increase a lot. 






Walmart CEO: $25.7 million 

People employed by Walmart: 1.6 million

Yearly pay increase of every employee: $16






Starbucks CEO: $20.43 million 

People employed by Starbucks:  138,000

Yearly pay increase of every employee: $148


Ford CEO: $22.81 million

Yearly pay increase of every employee: $241 








Fedex CEO pay: $14.2 million 

People employed by FedEx: 280,000

Yearly pay increase of every employee: $50.71



How exactly would a $50 increase or a $241 increase to my yearly income help me significantly?

104. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization.

105. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network.

personalfinance,First time buyer. How much can I afford? ( Norway ),"Hi, I'm kinda nervous in case I make a terrible mistake. I have read a lot about that you shouldn't pay more than 30% of your net income to your housing including the loan, insurance, electricity etc. 

Mainly I have heard about this rule from people that is based in the US. I live in Norway where we do get free or cheap healthcare. Schools, dentist etc. I'm not sure if this rule is something that I can or should increase in Norway? All articles I can find about Norway is ""how much can the bank give you"" which isn't really what I'm looking for.

I work fulltime (37.5 hours a week) and earn $25 an hour.  We can pretty much work as much overtime as we want where we get paid 50% extra, but this isn't something I want to rely on.

I have saved $80K so far, but I will be putting $10K to the side for furniture's, and $5K as a safety deposit. 

I'm looking for an apartment around the Bergen area. The ""common costs"" are usually between $50 - $200 a month, and the ""Municipal cost"" is between $500 - $1000 a year.
I have made this little table that shows the cost depending how much housing I'm buying.

Common cost: Usually includes outside maintenance, internet etc.
Municipal cost: Water, garbage pickup etc.
Net $3,1K: How much of my net value will go to the total that includes the loan, common cost, and Municipal cost.


Equity|House value|Mortgage|Mortgage ratio|Interest rate|Mortgage/mo|Common cost/mo|Municipal/mo|Total/mo|Net $3,1K

Well today is the day. As I write this it is noon on a Wednesday, I am sitting at the brewery next door to our townhouse with my laptop, an IPA, and our dog at my feet. &amp;nbsp;

**Quick summary:**
Me (42M) and my wife (37F) are FIRE as of today. I was Active Duty US military until last night at midnight, when I retired after 20 years of service. &amp;nbsp;

**Numbers summary** (rounded for ease of illustration, all income is take home/after taxes): &amp;nbsp;

Assets  
$1M in index funds and IRAs (current market value, was higher a few months ago)  
$600K rental property owned outright, generates $1K/mo after taxes, management fees, condo fees (bought in 2009)  
$600K “forever” town house we live in, $300K owed (bought in 2016)  
$50K cars owned outright (both bought in 2016)  
$100K in cash/savings accounts (will probably invest a good portion sometime soon but for now it’s a nice cushion while we settle into FIRE)  
No debt other than townhouse mortgage (2.25% interest rate) &amp;nbsp;

Predictable and guaranteed income:  
$7K/month from military retirement and disability, adjusts automatically for inflation and cost of living  
$1K/month from rental property  
Edit: We get $2200/mo rent, property manager takes $300/mo, condo fees are $600/mo, we save $300/mo for property tax, so the useable income for us is $1000. Once we get a new tenant we'll raise the rent to $2800 but we're not going to raise it on the current one. &amp;nbsp;

Predictable but not long-term income:  
$5K/month from wife’s continued employment (defense work/civilian) &amp;nbsp;

Somewhat predictable but not long-term income:  
$40K surge from wife’s deployments (typically once per year for a few months) &amp;nbsp;

Health care:  
Tricare for retired military - $300 annually for me and the wife, plus co-pays per visit of $20-$100 depending on severity; catastrophic cap of $3500 &amp;nbsp;

**FIRE Plan Summary:**  
The $8K/month in predictable/guaranteed income covers all of our expenses to include day-to-day living, continued investment into IRAs and index funds, health care, and the remaining mortgage payments on the town house. Vacations, new cars, other larger expenses will come from wife’s continued income and income surges, at least for another ~5 years. We absolutely will not spend all of this excess and it’ll just be redirected into savings or investments at the end of each year. Once the wife decides to stop working, we’ll likely be able to just withdraw 2-4 years worth of vacation/car/large expenses from our index funds as needed and stay well within the safe withdrawal rate. Eventually we think we’ll sell the townhouse and move into the rental condo full-time - that could be in 5 years or 20 years. &amp;nbsp;

**Why did I RE?**  
Twenty years of war and conflict was hard, and I’m tired. I am leaving substantial opportunities on the table - I was on track to continue getting promoted and reach higher levels of responsibility and income but I simply don’t want to do it anymore. In the last few years I talked to friends of mine who had retired from the military and the one common sentiment was “you’ll never regret retiring too early.” This made an impact on me as I saw several senior leaders and mentors of mine essentially trapped in their careers, unable to make a graceful exit for a variety of reasons. I’m only 42, in great health, and we’ve built a life we love so I want to be here to experience it all. &amp;nbsp;

**What am I going to do?**  
I’m not sure yet. Recreational Employment may be something down the road but for now I’ve got plenty to do. I found that it was fun to think about my daily schedule over the last few years, and here’s what I’ve settled on for a basic Monday-Friday:  

5:00 - Wake up, clean up, let the dog out, make espresso for me and the wife  
6:00 - Wife leaves for the gym, I take the dog out to run in the woods  
7:00 - Both of us are back, wife soon leaves for work, I do a morning strength session in the garage gym (squat or deadlift)  
7:30 - House cleaning chores, more espresso  
8:00 - Productive time - I’ve been working on music production as I’m a classically trained pianist getting back into it; the content here may evolve but it will remain what I consider productive/learning/creating  
11:00 - Run errands/groceries/mail/etc  
11:30 - Mobility and conditioning workout in the garage/in the sun  
12:30 - Lunch/clean up  
1:30 - House projects or fuck off time (usually gaming online with my friends)  
3:30 - Reading and music or more productive time if I feel like it  
5:00 - Walk the dog downtown  
5:30 - Start to prepare dinner or happy hour with the wife  
7:00 - Reading and music inside or rooftop patio drinks with the wife, or we each do our own thing  
9:00 - In bed for a solid 8 hours  
*Wednesday is an off day for workouts so any additional chores or house projects are done during workout time that day &amp;nbsp;

One of the most formative books for me was Stephen King’s “On Writing.” In it he, the most prolific and successful writer in American history, said that he writes for at most three hours a day. I read it initially in 2002 and that thought has stayed with me; in fact that’s the reason I have always planned to allocate three hours a day for productive work once I retired. &amp;nbsp;

**Build the Life you Want, then Save for It**  
Many of us have heard this and for a long time I didn’t understand it even though I was actively doing it. I think the easiest way to explain my take on it is to start at the end. Today I find myself stepping into a life that seems almost too good to be true. My work experiences in the military have been enough to fill a lifetime. We’ve already traveled the world. We have massive equity in our dream house. We live downtown in a city we love - lots of inexpensive ways to stay entertained. My wife loves her job and all the friends she’s made here. We have great neighbors. We’re both in great health. And of course, all this is now fully funded with passive income. This is the life we wanted, and we’ve now saved for it. However, it was really, really fucking hard getting here. Going back 72 months from June of 2021 my wife and I had spent 58 of those 72 months on separate continents. Only through a combination of good decisions, moderation, luck, heartbreak, sacrifice, and hard work is this possible. And to be clear, we are only just now fully living this dream - it’s been a challenging last two decades. None of this came together until the last 12-18 months when things started happening as we had planned. &amp;nbsp;

If you’re still reading and don’t think I’m a complete asshole for writing about how good life is, thanks, and I’ll explain what it took to get here. I’ll put these thoughts in no particular order. &amp;nbsp;

**Focus on monthly cash flow, not total numbers.** This may be more applicable for some than others. For us it’s the basis of our FIRE plan. The goal is to keep our expenses, including continued investments, below the $8K/month income we generate. Since we’re fortunate to have my military pension it wouldn’t matter if we had $2M net worth like we do, or less than $100K. If we can keep the monthly cash flow sustainable we’ll be FIRE forever. &amp;nbsp;

**Good enough decisions.** You can analyze the numbers forever to get a correct answer, but it doesn’t mean it’s right. Part of the reason we have our rental property completely paid off is that for several years we dumped all the extra income we had into the mortgage on it. Of course it would have made more sense to put all that money into the market and make 8% instead of paying down our 3% loan, but that decision was good enough for us and in fact worked out well - now we’re completely without a mortgage payment for that property the same year that I RE. Sure it would be nice to have more in the market, but with our passive income we won’t have to make any withdrawals for several years. In the end we lost money on that mortgage payoff but it was good enough to get us where we wanted.   

**Patience is the most likely way to reach FIRE.** A few years into my military career I decided I’d figure out how to FIRE at 42, before FIRE was even a term. Knowing that I (and later we) would reach that goal kept me out of panic or opportunistic decisions like selling a bunch of stock during the downturn in the late 2000’s or buying speculative investments in the last few years. We had a plan, we were patient, and here we are. I cringe when friends of ours ask us if we’re planning to sell off any investments since the market is down. Be patient and play the long game. &amp;nbsp;

**Who you marry matters.** I was on the path to FIRE before I met my wife - we met 5 years into my military career. She had just completed grad school and an internship and was interested in learning how to budget and invest. She was open to ideas like buying reasonable cars, not eating out every night, etc. We had open discussions about finances. She had and still has tremendous earning potential. She’s been willing to make sacrifices financially, professionally, and personally to keep the FIRE plan on track. For the last few years, she’s made more money that I have. Would this have been possible with someone else? Maybe. For those of you not yet married but planning to someday, keep in mind that if you want to FIRE, who you marry matters. Your partner will ultimately contribute to or sabotage your plans - make sure you understand which one it is. &amp;nbsp;

**Combine finances.** I don’t understand how married couples don’t combine finances. It seems to me that if you don’t you’re simply prolonging a serious financial blow-up that should have been discussed much earlier. In some cases I can see how it makes sense - people coming off a divorce for instance. For us, it’s always made it easy to just say “we make X amount per month, we spend X amount per month, we have X amount invested, we’ll be FI when we reach X amount on X date.” A caveat to this is that spending and expenses don’t have to be 50/50. I like to work out, be outdoors, drink scotch, smoke cigars, and read. All that costs us about $200 a month. My wife rides horses, which costs us about $1200 a month. So the way we see it, we spend $1400 a month on recreation. I knew she was in the horse community well before we got married so we discussed it and figured it out. If we had separate finances and she had to figure out how to come up with $1200 in addition to funding retirement accounts, index funds, paying half a mortgage, and paying off her car, where would we be? I know where we wouldn’t be - happy and FIRE like we are now. &amp;nbsp;

**Only buy a house if you’d live in it for a long time.** We’ve lived in a lot of places during my career and had the opportunity to buy a house at every location. However, we decided that we’d only buy a house if we could see ourselves living in it in the long run. This led us to the great situation we’re in - we already own our “endgame” retirement condo, and we’ve got our forever house in the meantime. We’ve never had to stress over the right time to sell an investment property, or debate on spending money on upgrades on a house we don’t plan to ever live in after we move away. We also lucked out with both of our properties, bought in low markets in favorable locations where prices have essentially doubled. &amp;nbsp;

**Moderation and minimalism help a lot.** We developed a habit of moderation and minimalism when we first moved in together in the condo we now own as a rental property. We had 1,000 square feet so we held off buying a bunch of stuff we didn’t need. It turns out we still don’t need a lot of that. We haven’t had a TV set up in our living room in more than a decade. Only in the last few years did we spend real money on nice furniture once we knew we’d stay here for a long while. &amp;nbsp;

**Prioritize your health.** This contributes to FIRE in so many ways - reduces health care costs, reduces food bills, helps get you through challenging times, doesn’t cost much money. Intermittent fasting saves time and money; daily exercise is a way of life. We’ve got a simple plan - most days, eat mostly vegetables and most days, do something physically challenging. It’s worked great for us. &amp;nbsp;

**Do you like the thing, or just the idea of the thing?** This helped us make a lot of good decisions or postpone decisions until we knew for sure. Yes, we’d love to be closer to our families who are near the west coast. It seems like it would be a great idea to move back there since we can. But we’d have to give up much of what I listed above about where we live now. So it seems like we love the idea of moving back but we don’t think we’d love the implementation, at least not right now. This can apply to much smaller decisions too. It would be awesome to get a new Bronco or Jeep and keep the doors off all summer. It would be great to take to the beach. But in reality, I only drive for about 10 minutes a day now and that’s to take the dog out to the woods. Is it worth $50K for 10 minutes of enjoyment? The idea is good but in reality it’s not practical. Should we buy two kayaks and two paddleboards at a cost of a few thousand dollars since we’re short drives to lakes and beaches? That sounds like a great idea, but after multiple days at the beach and the lake we found we probably just need the one paddleboard we already have. &amp;nbsp;

**Absolutely, positively, one hundred percent of the time, keep your children and spouse away from the horse community.** Do you want a Porsche payment that lasts for 20 years and at the end of it you’re left not with a vintage 911 Turbo, but with a corpse that could be recycled to make glue? Keep your kids and your wife as far away from horses as you can. &amp;nbsp;

**One Unexpected Challenge**  
We have already encountered a completely unexpected challenge - my wife was initially in shock that I actually wanted to RE. Even though we’ve discussed this for years, known the exact date it would happen, and talked at length almost weekly about how nice it would be, she had a hard time with it for a few weeks. Essentially she was incredulous that after 20 years of being a high-performing, 24/7 on-call, passionate military leader who did nothing but get the hard jobs done, I’m now ready to just live out the boring daily schedule I listed above. She also struggled initially with what she calls a gender role reversal - I’m packing her lunch in the morning, cleaning the house, doing grocery shopping, and cooking dinner most nights. It took her a couple weeks to adjust and everything is fine now - she can see how happy I am and is totally supportive of whatever I want to do but the initial adjustment took some time. &amp;nbsp;

Finally I would like to emphasize that although we worked hard to get here we realize how fortunate we are. We wish nothing but the best for everyone on their own FIRE journey. &amp;nbsp;

If there’s any sort of interest in this post I’ll plan to make updates every six months or so, those seem to be well received on the sub. &amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading. I’ll hang around for a few days to answer any questions in the comments.

Edit: To answer questions I'm getting a lot - yes, we could do more with $600K if we sold the rental condo. But it's our dream retirement condo. We don't want to sell it now to make money we don't need to buy it again at a higher price when we're ready to move...which could be in just a few years.",finance,1654515402

Hope this sparks some meaningful discussion.

# Weekly Brief for the Coming Week of 6/6/22

**The Week Behind**

Courtesy of Friday’s sell-off on the backs of MU and AAPL, all the major indices closed the week in the red. DOW down 0.9%; NASDAQ down 1.0%; S&amp;P down \~1.2%.

Highlights:

* Jamie Dimon appeared to have flip-flopped as the CEO turned weather forecaster called for anything from a category 1 hurricane to a “superstorm Sandy” after proclaiming the clouds were clearing the week before.
* Markets grappled with the 10-year retesting 3%.
* Indices reacted poorly to PMI, but positively to mixed employment data.
* The Chinese economy began reopening.
* Microsoft (MSFT) revised earnings downward as a strong U.S. dollar weighs on multinationals (FX revision).
* Bearish calls on Micron (MU) and Apple (AAPL) as DRAM prices appear to be deflating, and Apple’s app store is suffering due to slowdowns in China.

Although Friday’s session was poor, overall, the market continued its recent trend of ending up despite bad news. On Wednesday, we traded down as QT began, sending the 10 year close to 3%, and May PMI came out to 56.1%, suggesting the economy may still be hot enough to warrant additional FED tightening. However, the indices recovered pretty well by the close. On Thursday, it was MSFT’s downward FX revision and FED Vice Chair Brainard reiterating her hawkish position that caused an AM sell-off. However, by midday a bounce was underway that had enough energy for all three of the major indices to close convincingly at weekly highs. Friday, downgrades to AAPL and MU resulted in a down open without a bounce. However, the major indices refused to give back gains made in the prior week’s rally. In short, while the indices did not stage a bounce to close the week, the indices showed some resilience by refusing to fold.

**Is The Rally Intact?**

In my view, the rally is still intact, but there now arise fair questions surrounding how much steam remains. With the 10 year below 3%, S&amp;P holding 4,100, plenty of bad news priced in, and earnings holding up, I think there is more room for upside. Furthermore, it appears that the 10-year yield and investor appetite are largely dependent on the FED’s tightening path. Assuming the FED doesn’t deviate from its planned 50 bps hikes at the next two meetings, I think the market is range bound pending data relative to the FED’s action in September. Do we see a 25, 50, or 75bp hike? Do we see additional reduction of the balance sheet? Economic indicators, bellwether earning reports, and “FED Speak” is our best source of additional insight. *Given year-over-year comps for CPI get easier for the latter half of the year, there is reason to believe the FED will have some leeway to slow tightening, which is bullish for equities.*

**The Week Ahead**

Speaking of economic indicators, this week features consumer credit - 3pm, Tuesday - initial and continuing jobless claims - 8:30am, Thursday - and CPI - 8:30am, Friday. Consumer credit will provide insight on how households are handling elevated levels of food and energy inflation. A poor reading may create the perception the FED will remain aggressive in September. It would also give reason to sell consumer discretionary. As per jobs, we want a middle-of-the-road number. Too hot, the FED needs to do more to slow the economy. Too cool, the economy is falling into more than a slowdown. CPI, we want a cool core and headline to permit less aggressive action in September.

As per earnings, Dave and Buster’s (PLAY) reports Tuesday after the bell. A good number would suggest consumers are spending on “experiences”. Campbell (CPB) reports Wednesday before the open. It is considered a safe-haven in the current environment and part of an exclusive club of stocks that are positive YTD. Otherwise, Thursday after the bell is DocuSign (DOCU). The stock has been cut in half YTD. I think this company has legs post-COVID; however, it will need to deliver a compelling post-pandemic plan or commentary to change its perception as a pandemic-darling.

As previously mentioned, I think the market’s primary concern is FED action in September. Remember, the FED promised to be data dependent beyond the June and July meetings. The FED’s move in September is dependent on the health of the economy and state of inflation as illustrated through all of the data leading up to September’s meeting. While this week’s data is important, it only begins to set the table for the FED’s next move. Most simply, the FED will not be making final decisions on September based on this week’s data. I issue this reminder because the market will react in the moment, and you can expect FED members to do the same via interviews and press releases. *Don’t let an extreme response from either cause you to make an emotional decision with your portfolio.*",finance,1654515623
stocks,High-Frequency Trading (HFT) explained - The war between man and machine that extracts $billions from the market,"**Intro**  

HFT uses custom-built machines to buy or sell the assets you want before you can - then sell you those same assets for a profit.  They are the potentially unnecessary middle-man charging a hidden tax by beating humans to the market.

**What's HFT?**  

HFT is a subset of algorithmic trading that specializes in scale and speed.  HFT can potentially execute 1000s of trades in the time it takes a human trader to blink. The fastest firms can reach speeds of sub-16 microseconds (16 millionths of a second) per trade. 

**Speed (Latency) Advantage**  

HFT exists to be first. Mostly it takes advantage of arbitrage (buying on one exchange and selling to another at a higher price).  It also detects orders placed by other traders taking a share of their profits by capitalizing on the market movement. 

**Pay for Speed**  

HFT firms spend millions to reduce latency, building infrastructures like cables and microwave towers.  Spread famously built a secret underground cable from New York to Chicago for $300 mil just to cut transfer speed by 3 milliseconds 

**Data or Nothing**  

HFT's algorithms are fed by info either from exchange price data feeds or more obscure sources. Without data, the machines don't know what to buy or sell.  Data is what makes HFT's speed valuable and HFT firms will do seemingly anything to get it. 

**Getting Data First** 

For HFT firms it's not enough to get the data, they need to get it and act on it before anyone else.  

[Reuters](https://www.cnbc.com/id/100809395) famously got caught selling access to the consumer confidence number to HFT firms minutes before public release. 

**Dark Pools**  

Dark Pools, exchanges owned by banks and hidden from the public, exist in theory to limit the impact of big orders on the market.  Some HFT firms get special access to data on trades happening inside, which they use to anticipate price movements on other exchanges. 

**Rebates**  

Rebates are incentives typically paid to a seller by an exchange to encourage liquidity.  HFT firms convinced some exchanges to pay buyers instead. This encourages traders to use these exchanges first giving HFT firms the tip of which assets to buy on other markets. 

**Regulation** 

In the US, brokers are required to buy stocks at the lowest market price - this is supposed to make markets fairer.  It also means HFT firms know where to look when another trader is looking to buy and they can use that information to beat them to the next market. 

**Pinging** 

If you want to know if people want to buy or sell you may need to do a little trading yourself.  HFT firms send small orders to exchanges. If they're filled instantly they infer bigger orders are coming &amp; use their speed to get to the other markets first. 

**Quantity** 

Over Quality  HFT impact seems insignificant taking as little as 0.0005USD per-share profit. But multiplied by the millions of trades HFT can execute in a day the impact can be huge  In 2008, HFT made an estimated 8-20 billion USD net profit! 

**Hidden Tax or Necessary Evil?** 

Some argue HFT is essential to healthy liquidity in the market.  Others claim HFT skims money from transactions that likely would have happened anyway.  As with most things, the answer is probably somewhere in the middle. 

**Harmony**  

HFT machines will always have a speed advantage over their human counterparts.  But man and machine can co-exist. As long as we can find system solutions that remove informational advantages for HFT firms to skim the profits of regular traders.

stocks,China Factor: Broad market rally in futures on China tech regulations wrapping up amid prospect of Lockdowns easing,"There is a broad market rally in market futures on optimism of China wrapping up tech company regulations. This provides further optimism atop China’s slow progression to lockdowns lifting, as a pickup in Chinese production economy would ease supply chain disruptions contributing to inflation and therefore reduce the amount of rate lift burden carried by the Fed in its attempt to rein in inflation. While easing business environment concerns will not stop an exit from China by companies exposed to ongoing risks from its COVID-Zero policy, the impact of an improved business environment in China’s massive economy provides significant lift to the global economy.

personalfinance,Question about what’s best for my credit history.,"So the details 

I currently am an authorized user on a parents carecredit card that has 15 years of on time payment history, but the card is at 75% of its limit.

My oldest card is only 6 years of on time payments, but is at 20% usage. 

Should I get the carecredit card removed from my credit history with its high usage? Or should I keep the card for its history length? Which option would be better for my credit score? I use my shorter history cards often but pay them down very aggressively while my parents pay just above the interest rate while keeping a large balance on their card. 

The carecredit card is also a third larger than all of the limits on my cards combined so I don’t know if having that larger pool is a good or a bad option.

So option A: Longer history but higher utilization/ larger credit pool

Option B: shorter history but much lower utilization rate/ smaller credit pool",finance,1654522966

They used two have two tiers of savings account, over $10k balance you got one APR, under you got less. I have always kept our emergency savings there, balance normally over $40k. Therefore, my account was always in the higher tier. I noticed recently that I was not getting their advertised interest rate (.7%). Instead I was getting the lower tier (.3%). 

I called customer service and apparently they created a new tier and my account wasn’t it. All I had to do was literally close the one and open the other, there were no requirements I failed to meet. 

It seems to me that they created a tier that would devalue legacy customers with old “high tier” accounts to skim a few tenths of a percentage of their accrued interest.

litecoin,The Photon Paper,"Before we dive into the serious nature of this subject matter I find it appropriate to go over a few key points that should be kept in mind of the reader. This is the opinion of a user known as “Knight” and nothing more. Anything discussed here is meant to facilitate a vision of what Litecoin offers to the masses as a global solution.

Litecoin… it is a Decentralized fork of Bitcoin with benefits of speed, security, and scalability. But why do we need it? At first glance this is a good question and it took me a long time in crypto before i understood exactly what Litecoin is and what makes it a game changer. In order to understand why any crypto is needed there should be some perspective on the current state of the world and it’s monetary system of centralized power.

Fiat Currency:

For as long as humans have been on Earth we have found ways to exchange goods and services through mediums of exchange. We used stones, sticks, water, land, ect… anything that was of value to the next person of which you needed something from. As time evolved humans began to find more clever ways to do business and a more common medium: Gold! This was before any fiat currency was globally accepted as money. Gold or Silver would be sent by land or water to the places it needed to go and this could’ve taken a month or two depending on location, if not longer.

Time passed and we evolved to paper money (notes) which was used as a more portable option and far less risky. This paper backed money was only good because the banks had the gold to back it up and replace the paper if needed…Until 1971 when Nixon (President of the United States at the time) drove the world’s leading economy away from the gold standard and made it to where people could no longer take their paper and turn it into gold (real money)…

The Dark Ages:

Fast forward to the 2000s and you find a lot of the paper money that used to be backed by gold is not anymore and has been inflated to astronomical proportions. In 1913 a $1 would’ve bought you 16 loaves of bread ($0.06 per loaf), and in 2013 the price of that same loaf is…over $1. At the time of writing (2022) a loaf of bread is $2.74.

The buying power of the dollar has fallen drastically… from 1913 to 2013 you are talking about a 94% decline! This is the cancer of inflation, the root of financial woes and trouble… and who is Economy’s doctor from this? The Federal Reserve and Centralized banks.

Centralized Power:

How is it possible to just create more of something and deem it acceptable by everyone even though it devalues everyone else’s portion without their consent? Government. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is an independent entity to the Federal Government, but… The Federal Government hires the people in charge of the Fed. And the Feds’ job is to regulate the financial structure of the economy managing the downturns and upswings. Keep in mind that the Federal Reserve is made up of humans and they make errors like everyone else. So in no way is this a proper system to manage the debts and credits of an entire global economy!

Your Bank:

Outside of the Fed regulations and how they inflate the dollar there is also the bank who thanks to the Fed and government can create “magic money” that really doesn’t exist.

Example. Say you have $100 and you put it in your bank. That bank now has control over that money and although when you check day and night your $100 stays there. But what you don’t see is what they do with your money. They loan it out to people and charge interest (for them)! so your $100 gets loaned to charlie with a fee… $97. Charlie then takes that and buys something with it… the merchant then puts that $97 into a bank…and yeah rinse and repeat. Now your $100 has been turned into $33,000 in the system, then that cash is used in the stock market to bet against the very loans they just gave you. No wonder it takes your bank days to process a transaction…

Bitcoin and Litecoin:

The problems above are the root of the cancer that eats away at society and takes it down a road of no return. Bitcoin when it was created had a Libertarian vision of returning to the old method of trade which was peer to peer not needing an intermediary (bank). This vision has been at the core of All of crypto, which is the financial freedom that each human seeks in their heart.

Litecoin as stated above is a fork (an update in simpler terms) of bitcoin and solves every major problem above!

Litecoin is a trusted network that runs by the community and for the community meaning there is no centralized authority on what should be done concerning it. Updates happen as needed and voted on by those working on the open source code! Litecoin also solves the problem of inflation because there will only ever be 84,000,000 LTC in existence and so the supply cannot be manipulated. Litecoin because of it’s speed can get a transaction through at the speed of light and with little to no cost to the user. When you receive your LTC in the wallet there is no one else who moves it around or manipulates it like a bank can do with fiat! It is yours and no one can move it except you! Litecoin also can be used as a payment through the wallet with the card feature so there is no need for a bank! With Blockchain as a monetary policy for a nation, it would eliminate the human potential for error and showcase that the Network knows best how to handle a global economy. From an information perspective it already does, look at google and how many people use it compared to an actual dictionary. Blockchain is no different! Humankind has been through cycle of cycle in a fiat spiral that regardless of how long you evade, it has one destination and that’s destruction. The system has been broken beyond repair and nature has give us a solution: Blockchain! It is the next evolution of a peer to peer infrastructure that will replace a Centralized authority of both monetary policy and social dynamics. Litecoin has already built the tech for the future and is only a couple of steps away from getting us to the vision that is Bitcoin and Litecoin. As soon as the wallet is able to accept a direct deposit and have the funds be converted into photons then the banks will no longer be needed and adoption is all that is left!",cryptocurrency,1654525758

We have an emergency savings for about 6 months of expenses.  

I also have about $9,000 in a Roth IRA (I know the contributions and up to $10,000 of the earnings *can* be used for a first home purchase, though I'm not sure if it's a good idea).  She is starting to look into retirement accounts for the first time now.  We both work in government jobs so no 401k but we will get a pension.

We're currently able to put aside about $800/month, though that will drop to about $450/month once the freeze on federal student loans ends in August (unless it's extended).  Assuming nothing changes on those, they'll be paid off through Public Service Loan Forgiveness for her in 2025 and for me in 2027.

Houses in our area are typically around $270k to $320k at the moment.  Prices are increasing but not as fast as I've been reading from some areas.

We have a car loan of $11k with an interest rate of 5.66%.  I'm wondering if it is best to put our extra savings money into paying this off faster and then do other savings/investment strategies.

# World economy

This time world economy is not in the greatest shape. Recession might be looming.

Post covid issues, war in ukraine, oil prices (affects everything) , logistics issues etc.

Which led to inflation, which leads to FED QE tightening, essentially taking money out of the markets, primarily stock market, but this also affects crypto market.

It is all affecting consumers and there is less free money floating around and speculating, **however**, all this is  priced in for some time now.

# Prerequisite for growth - tech 

Ethereum is a home to digital money, global payments, and applications - a whole booming digital economy.

It will now significantly improve. The technology behind it will allow much more. 

All the L2 solutions that are up and coming, that scale Ethereum, will scale even more now.

At its peak, dapps and smart contracts were almost unusable with the transaction times and fees. But now, they get empowered. This is like 5G, allowing for users to create so much more.

We could start rising now. The small bull run could happen right now in its infancy fueled by the new Ethereum and the L2 solutions and being on toes to boom as soon as economy stabilizes.",cryptocurrency,1654536242

personalfinance,Home Buying: Less down payment for more cash flow...,"My wife and I are in the process of selling our house &amp; buying another. We are going to make a sizeable profit on our house and we are planning to put down 35% on our new home that will come from those profits. I'm wondering if we should make less of a down payment so we can walk away with more cash in hand &amp; use it to pay off car loans. Both of our car loans have low interest rates, and I know that we would essentially be rolling the car loan into the home loan that is at a higher interest rate by doing this, as well as paying for them over 30 years vs whats left on the loans (5 &amp; 6 years).

However after talking with my lender and doing some math, by paying off both cars, even though we'd have a higher mortgage payment per month, we would have more cash after our bills to put into savings each month. My thinking is that having more cash on hand per month could be more ideal if we go into a recession and are required to dip into our cash savings should something happen to jobs or otherwise. We could also use that cash to invest if we so choose. When or If mortgage rates go down in the next few years we would refi.

For some background, we currently have a fully funded 10-12 mo emergency fund and both max out our retirement accounts each year (401k &amp; IRAs). The additional amount we could add to savings is north of $500 / mo by paying off the vehicles vs keeping the payments.",finance,1654538852

stocks,What are so many companies unprofitable?,"When I'm screening for interesting stocks, I notice so many of them don't have a PE.

And yet even where these companies revenues are increasing they are still unable to turn a profit or even worse, their deficits are increasing.

I believe with rising interest rates and the free money fountains being turned off, we're going to reach a place very quickly and probably next year where cash flow and income matters. Some of these stocks are already down 30+% and imo if companies can't show profits soon they could be in trouble.

So I’ve heard from a couple different sources (locally, nothing from actual institutions) that the market is slated for a downturn and a recession in 2023.

I have money in two mutual funds and an S&amp;P500 fund. 

So: would it be worth it to gut those now and push all of that money into my HYSA, wait for the market to tank, and then push all that money back into the S&amp;P500?

2:

My understanding is that with an HYSA, the worst that can happen is you get an interest rate of 0%, but with anything that is based on the market, your shares of that fund could drop so that you actually have *less* money if you pull out at the bottom.

So: what is a “money market” account? Is it like an HYSA but with better interest?

personalfinance,"ID theft with recurring incidents after the fact, what are the best steps to take?","Around last December or so, my wife got hit with unemployment fraud. Super common in my state apparently because it's so easy here. Pretty easy to clear up seeing as she was still gainfully employed.

She filed a police report, as well as informed her employer and the appropriate state/federal offices. The person used a VPN, so nothing came of it. Not sure where the source of the leak was, though... nothing sketchy on her end that we're aware of, but who knows these days. Maybe her workplace because her boss got hit with this last year, but oh well.

She then locked down her credit reports, changed bank/e-mail passwords, etc. All the basic things you're supposed to do... I think. The major things at least. She followed the steps on IdentityTheft.gov, I believe. Not sure if she skipped or missed any, though.

A month or two after, she got a letter from Wells Fargo saying someone tried to open an account, but failed on account of the credit lock. So things were working. I told her to update the police report with the incident, but I'm not sure she ever did... not sure that's even a thing to do, but whatever.

Now today she got an e-mail notice that someone successfully opened a Capital One account. She called the fraud dept and got it shut down, but once she has time she's going to verify that her credit reports are still locked/frozen/whatever.

So it looks like this is going to be ongoing for a bit here. Seems like there's a playbook that someone is following... that or her info is getting sold/recycled and new people keep trying.

What's the next step? Did she miss something that she was supposed to do? Is this a situation where identity theft monitoring/protection is worth paying for? Should she be filing/updating a police report every incident? In my head, that serves to 1) make a formal record of fraud to protect her, and 2) maybe help build a case to find (and more importantly stop) the person. #1 seems worthwhile, #2 seems like a pipe dream, but I dunno, maybe the person will slip up, or they'll have enough info eventually to find the person I guess.

It's been frustrating watching it go sideways or down even though they more than doubled their expected earnings last quarter. I'll list my thoughts individually so someone can poke holes in my thinking if they are so inclined.  
1) Positive: There is a 5 million home deficit right now, which is predicted to take many years to catch up to.  
2) Positive: Millennials are the largest demographic in the US and they are technically poised to purchase their first or second homes within the next 10 years. Gen Z isn't as large but the older end of the spectrum should be buying their first homes soon.  
3) Positive: Wildfires and hurricanes seem routine at this point. That should contribute reliable demand in the form to rebuilds and repairs. Maybe I'm wrong about this and the add on is trivial.  
4) Positive: I know PE isn't everything, but is it nothing? If earnings for next 3 quarters actually fell a buck a share vs Q1 it would still put this stock at just 5.3x 2022 earnings.  
5) Positive: Management seems to be laser focused on the shareholder. I believe buybacks topped a billion last year, and half a billion so far in 2022. I've only read positive things about management's reputation, but for all I know they wrote those articles themselves.  
6) Neutral: Are the baby boomers entering retirement + death a big deal? Are their houses set to flood the market as they pass on or transfer to nursing homes? I haven't heard much about this factor.  
7) Negative: Mortgage rates have gone up and will continue to do so. The people I know who have built recently or are in the process of building didn't seem to take rising interest rate too seriously when I brought them up. They were shocked by the labor and supply costs though. I guess I haven't taken rising interest rates as seriously as the market does. Are there some folks who believe 9%+ rates within the next 2 years is probable? At that point I will admit to being completely out of my depth trying to guess what that could mean for builds.

personalfinance,401(k) as a means of debt consolidation.,"Okay. So, every source online that I read says to not take a 401(k) loan. The majority of sources say borrowing against it is a bad idea, that'll end up costing me, etc. So, I want to ask you all your opinion on the following to see if I'm missing something:

Suppose you're in a good amount of debt. Let's say $10,000 in credit cards @ an average of 20%,  $14,000 in personal loan @ an average of 13%, and $50,000 student loans at 5%.  

Now, you want to get out of debt, or at least high interest debt. Your options are:

1. The conventional route: choose an arbitrary amount per check, pay your income tax on that amount, use the remaining amount  to chip away at the debt. 

2. 401(k): choose an aribtrary % of your paycheck, have it deposited tax free into the 401(K) account, wait until you have enough to wipe the debt entirely or at least make a significant dent, borrow that much against from the 401(K), use it to repay your bills. 

3. Take out a personal loan to refinance to a lower rate. 

4. Bankruptcy. 

I'd say 2 is the best option because:
1. It allows one to take high interest debt and replace it with lower interest debt (401(k) loans have interest rates below other personal lending sources according to what I read), thus lessening the total interest paid out. 
2. not only is the rate lower but the rate is paid into the 401(k), so one's future self would keep the interest, and 
3. one could pay the debt down faster because it takes less time to accumulate a given amount pre-tax than post-tax. 

The catch is the administrative set up fee and annual fee for the loan(s), which from my observations are nominal.

This is true for K-12 and college faculty alike. Along the way, they'll likely qualify for an income-based repayment plan that will cap the maximum monthly payments at something like 15% of adjusted gross income AND these borrowers have the option to defer a monthly payment up to I think it's 24 times if they experience hardships along the way. So, in a sense, we already forgive student loans, but only after a debt of servitude is fulfilled. This applies to all goverment law enforcement officials, public school/college/university staff, public and nonprofit healthcare workers, goverment employees, and the list goes on.

I'd be interested in seeing some granular student loan data by degree level, specialization, and number of degrees to see how many people are liable to land jobs that are eligible for PSLF. And by number of degrees, I mean how many people pursued a second bachelors or masters degree. I ask for that data point because I'd bet if you were to survey students who pursued multiple degrees, one right after another, you'd find that many of them did so to gain access to excess financial aid funds and/or to postpone their student loan payments from coming due.

The unspoken answer to this question, lies in the distinctive visions for the right of users between Bitcoin Maximalist and Alt-coiners (including those who favor inventions across Web3, DAO, and Defi).

The Bitcoin Maximalist believe that Bitcoin is the sole solution to the corrupted Fiat system and the ultimate alternative payment method in the digital era, and this has been supported by BTC’s dominance over the entire crypto market since its invention. While they admit the existence of alt-coins, they believe those are just the mimics of Bitcoin, most of which hardly survive over the next few years, even though clothed in fancy features like programmability, inter-compatibility etc.

The Alt-coiners often have respect for Bitcoin, however, they believe the notion that Bitcoin has been proofed unable to solve all the negative affects brought by Fiat system, nor to meet the new features focusing on various use cases, where the alt-coins are perfectly competing with Bitcoin.

Maxed out my 401K. IRA maxed for the year. Income is $116,000 with a $600 a month auto (pre-tax).

Job is really secure. I am moving in the fall (rent about $2300 a month) and have $20,000 set aside in another bank to cover moving expenses. 

Should I use my emergency fund to pay off my car note?",finance,1654569670
personalfinance,seeking advice on how to get a mortgage when I quit my job six months ago,"Hi, I want to buy a house which is well in my price range and I love it. I learned today that I can't get pre-approved since I am now ""self employed"" having quit my job about 6 months ago to go freelance. Freelance is bumpin' and I have a high credit score and plenty of liquid for a down payment. I've talked to two trusted loan officers who have told me that I need two years of proof of steady employment income before I can qualify for pre-approval. Maybe one year if I do a ""no doc."" I could get a cosigner but this is not an option for me. Does anyone know of any magic mortgage options? I want to figure it out so I can make an offer on this place but I also want to just give up and get sad and get over it if it's truly impossible. Thanks for your thoughts.

update:::: Thanks everyone for your comments, they are super helpful and appreciated. I've learned a lot and I am considering these three options--knowing that it is likely that none will work and that this house will not be mine. 1. Make a high offer with seller financing. This won't work unless the seller is happy to have the money in a dribble, and maybe they think it's cool that the bank won't be making any money 2. Find a manual underwriter who will look at me holistically and will work outside of Fed guidelines (also extremely unlikely but possible, I can show very strong income since I've gone freelance, and my main client is my previous employer so it kind of looks like I just went to 1099 from staff, I mean, that is basically what happened) 3. I get a ""hard money"" loan even though the terms are way less favorable than a mortgage, I go for it because the house is worth it to me. Okay so here's my NEW question, it's about hard money lending. WHY does everyone care so much that it's an investment property and not my primary residence? The truth is that it will be a mix of both, sometimes I'll rent it, sometimes I'll live there alone, sometimes I'll have roommates probably. Do I just need to highlight the rentability? Are they really going to make sure I'm renting it and not living there? Any other thoughts welcome, and also if you'd like to privately lend me money or cosign please get in touch lol.",finance,1654573704
inflation,I researched why gas is getting so expensive so you don't have to.,"**Elasticity of Demand** 

Gasoline is something that economists call a relatively inelastic product, meaning that changes in price have little influence on demand, at least in the short term. This makes sense, as much travel isn’t discretionary (commuting, etc.). In contrast, air travel is highly elastic, with a 10% increase in the price of air travel leading to an around 12% reduction in the demand for air travel. With car gasoline purchases it’s closer to 3.4% reduction for a 10% increase. There has been some recent data suggesting it’s becoming more elastic, but now we’re getting into the weeds. 

So, what this is all getting to is that when gas gets more expensive, people still have to buy it in the same quantities, for the most part. 

**How much more expensive has gas become?** 

As of recording, the average gas price in the USA is $4.85 cents per gallon for regular and $5.63 per gallon for diesel. The most expensive state is California at $6.33 per gallon. 

A year ago, regular gasoline was $3.05 average in the nation and $4.22 in California. That represents a 59% increase YoY.

**What causes the state’s variation in prices?** 

Some states tax gas more heavily than others — California for example has a 61 cents per gallon tax, whereas Alaska only charges 14.6 cents per gallon. There is also a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon. The distance to a refinery also makes a difference, because that gas at the gas station has to be hauled in, one way or another. Some states (such as CA) also have certain blend requirements that can also drive up price. 

Okay, so what can the government do about it? 

Lyn Alden is one of the clear voices on inflation and macroeconomics that I follow. She has been saying lately that the government can print money, but they can’t print oil. 

In the last episode we heard from President Biden that he announced on March 31st that he would be releasing 1MM barrels a day from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This will be the biggest withdrawal in the 46-year history of the reserve. In this speech Biden also blamed oil companies for leaving drilling prospects idle — this doesn’t make a ton of sense because his administration recently announced (after his March 31st speech) that the Biden Administration will not hold a lease sale for offshore drilling this year. They are also letting a 5-year plan for offshore drilling expire next month. 

This prompted Frank Macchiarola Match-E-Roll-A of the American Petroleum Institute to respond: “Unfortunately this is becoming a pattern— the administration talks about the need for more supply and acts to restrict it. As geopolitical volatility and global energy prices continue to rise, we again urge the administration to end the uncertainty and immediately act on a new five-year program for federal offshore leasing.” 

**By the way, how much is in the strategic petroleum reserve?** 

Well, they publish it on the department of energy’s website. I’ll post the link below. It’s pretty funny — this little pixilated image comes up that is almost illegible. I think I saw 526.5 million barrels, so we would be using roughly 180 / 526 or 34% of it with this release. Funny names of the oil sites: Bryan Mound has 211.8 million barrels, Big Hill has 115.7 million barrels, West Hackberry has 167, Bayou Choctaw has 50.7 Million barrels. For what it’s worth, we tend to import about 

It takes 13 days from the time the president decides to release it until it hits the U.S. Market. Last note, the average price paid is $29.70 per barrel, or 0.54 cents per gallon — pretty good deal considering Brent crude is now $121/barrel. 

**Okay so Why the heck are gas prices so high?** 

People are quick to point to the war in Ukraine as a catalyst, but in my view that really just may have been the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

This brings me to my next point about why prices are high. We have the war, and general inflation, but prices have roughly doubled in the last two years and, while CPI may under estimate inflation (and we’ll talk about that in future episodes), I believe there is more to the story than this. Many oil and gas companies have fallen out of favor, getting the blame for global warming while we still continue to use their products. The oil and gas divestment movement emerged in 2011 on college campuses and 10 years later 1508 institutions representing 40.43 trillion dollars of assets had divested from the fossil fuel industry according to divestmentdatabase.org In 2011 Exxon mobile was the largest company in the world and hardly seemed to need anyone’s help. In 2020, in the height of the pandemic, when its share price dipped to $32/share, it was it was briefly eclipsed in market capitalization by Zoom. This just shows you how crazy things were getting. It has since climbed to near all-time highs at $99/share. Bear in mind this company has historically paid strong dividends in the 3-5% range. 

**What did these divestments accomplish?**

Oil and gas companies saw their valuations stagnate and fall in the 2010s as they were sold off by pension funds (NYC pension fund, La Banque Postale), educational endowments (Harvard, Oxford), philanthropic organizations (ford foundation, Rockefeller brothers organization) and faith-based organizations. 

Increasing the difficulty to the oil &amp; gas companies was the unexpected fracking boom. 

The fracking boom increased energy supply and lowered prices for the average consumer (reducing the average US residential customer by 25% from 2009 to 2019 adjusted for inflation) while there was less money for the oil companies to invest in drilling, and the political winds didn’t seem to support it either. So they simply sat on the capacity they had and waited for better times. Those better times have come. The oil companies are now in the catbird seat and the rest of us are going to have to pay. 

In the UK, which relies much more on Russian oil and has experienced a much worse energy crisis than we have, they have announced (May 26th) that they will impose a 25% windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help those crippled by soaring energy costs. While this might sound like a good idea, it will have long-term consequences. International companies that view themselves as being taken advantage of will weigh this hostile regulatory and taxation environment inter future expansion plans. Many UK firms such as Harbour, Inquest and Serica are trading at 20% lower following the levy announcement. 

We’ll discuss the UK in a future episode, where many households are now spending more than 10% of their total budgets on energy bills (average US household spends 2-3% on electricity). 

Now, back to the US gasoline prices again. Washington state recently had a gas shortage in Kennewick, Pasco and West Richland. Some gas stations in Washington have started adding a digit to their displays so that they can accommodate 2-digit gasoline prices. While this is not financial advice, I do like to occasionally throw out predictions. I think we’ll see $10 gasoline in the next couple years. 

In the long run I think we’ll be able to come up with several energy sources that are non fossil-fuel based. As prices continue to rise it will raise the incentive to innovate, perhaps using geothermal, tidal, nuclear or even blue-green algae to produce cheap, clean power. The transition to electric vehicles will eventually reduce the need for fossil fuels. But the idea that we can simply defund and ignore a troublesome industry, while continuing to demand their products, is not working out as intended.

104. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
105. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network.

107. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources.

Where  do people think money will go, in a high interest environment? Obviously  to the country that is predicted to cut interest rates and whose stock  market has already corrected.

Regardless  of the risk China represents, it's still better than putting more money  into an already over value market that's about to raise interest rates.  Smart money isn't stupid. It's going to diversify and China is one of  the obvious targets. The other being India, Southeast Asia, etc.

RBA was expected to raise interest rates by 25Bps. There were rumors there were going to raise them by 40Bps due to China going out of lockdown and Australia's need to keep up with them.

Turns out the RBA raised interest rates by a huge 50Bps hitting risk.

A 40BPS raise would've had the same outcome since other risk assets priced in this possible scenario beforehand.

personalfinance,Debating if I should make a down payment on car.,"Am in the process of buying a car, have a credit score of 802, $30K in savings (50K in 401K but I am never intend of touching that money anytime soon) . I make 50K a year, very minimum expense per month (totalling around $1000).

I got approved for a vehicle loan at my credit union for $30K 65 months, and a 2.24% interest rate. I did the math which I would be paying around $490 which is a payment I can afford fine. 

But my question was if it would be wise to make a down payment on this car, was thinking of doing $8K. But when I know that when it comes to car, they're the worst for investments as they lose equity very fast (though nowadays the market is interesting).",finance,1654595942

CryptoCurrency,Full decentralization. Non-obvious issues of a popular sentiment,"The debate between supporters of full decentralization web3 and the centralized approach has reached the culmination lately. Each side maintains its views and forgot that history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, but it does rhyme. I invite you to revisit the history of the web and what it was like in the 00s-10s in order to predict the possible future. 

Everyone knows that we have gone from a decentralized web to a centralized web2. It should be obvious to everyone that web3 should adopt the strengths of both models and give up their weaknesses. However, grousing still continue around the decentralization issue. 

It is funny to look at the decentralization supporters, promoting their beliefs and turning off their VPN to order a meal. Even more ridiculous are those who promote federated networks as complete decentralization solutions. The users of  Mastodon, Pixelfed, or Lemmy often talk about being decentralized. But they are not!

But a cool example of a working decentralized network existed back in 2015, it was ZeroNet. But now it's just a ghost. The network has gone dead because of the unscalability and complexity for ordinary users. 

I think all fans of the idea of a decentralized web should remember that complete decentralization is just naively utopian. Newness and anonymity are fine. But for most people, usability is much more important, which is why the maxis approach will never find mass appeal.",cryptocurrency,1654600563

stocks,Thoughts on current environment? Bear market rally? Bottomed?,"Wondering everyones thoughts on the current market and more importantly why? Do we think this is a bear market rally? or have we hit the bottom and will trade sideways for a bit? I do no think we will hit all time highs within this year (although what do i know), but if you do would love to know why. 

Some of the facts / upcoming factors:

\-CPI: We know inflation is high, potentially (hopefully) peaked, but still decently high (if estimates for May are 8.2% its not really going down fast yet) with huge inventory numbers from walmart, target, etc it may suggest as cathie wood has said we see inflation go down big quick, potentially deflation. Although gas prices and utilities are still skyrocketing

\-QT started / interest rates going up: less money in the world, less borrowing, potentially (probably) more slowdown 

\-Q2/Q3 earnings: even if we do not go into a recession (on paper or not), we are already starting to see from Q1 guidance that future earnings reports will not be great. Mix in recession fears, or a recession itself, future earnings will be tough to top for most stocks

\-Potential rate hike pause or slowdown: Anthony Pomp is thinking inflation will go down big time, and we will be in a bad recession, the fed will pause, or maybe even decrease rates (2h of year), this would be good for market and economy cuz inflation would be going away and incentivize spending again.

At this point I am not sure what has been priced in or not (lol), and please comment if i missed any other big headwinds (I'm sure i have). Based on the above, even if the fed U-turned, i just cannot see stocks going to all time highs any time soon (this year). With so much uncertainty it seems like a bear market rally, but if it was that easy to guess, I wouldn't be typing on reddit, I'd be swimming in my private pool sippin pina colada's",finance,1654602775

personalfinance,Budgeting with a partner help,"23 y/o recent college grad. I live with my girlfriend (who i do plan to marry/buy a house with in the next 3 years) and we are very fortunate to not have to pay rent (her parents pay it) so i want to maximize this opportunity while we’re young, but I am not sure if I am doing so…

I bring in 70-75k/year (60k base/10-15k bonus) and my girlfriend brings in 60k.

Monthly breakdown is as follows (for normal months when we each take home ~4k after tax, savings/investments are higher when i get bonus quartlery):

401k (Roth):
Me - 10% (3% match)
GF - 0

Roth IRA: 
Me - $500 
GF - $500 

Student Loans:
Me - $500 ($250 for an ISA, $250 for federal w total balance of ~24k @ 5.05%)
GF - $0 (23k federal, taking advantage of the pause)

Savings:
Me - $250 (savings balance is $16,000)
GF - whatever she can (savings balance is $3,000)

Cars:
Me - $170 pmt + $100 insurance ($270)
GF - $500 pmt + $200 insurance ($700)

Utilities:
Me - $64
GF - $0

My GF and i disagree a bit about the budgeting (as you can see from the breakdown) - mostly when it comes to the amount we should invest. Shes having a hard time seeing the importance of investing/paying down debt. We dont have any major fights over it but i get a bit concerned about our goals with how little she is putting towards retirement/savings/SL - am i over-doing it? Is she under-doing it? Does it even matter all that much?

Edit: thanks for all the feedback, guys - read through all of these and really appreciate the input. Its bittersweet to get affirmation that it is as big of an issue as ive been thinking.

personalfinance,Need advice on leasing a car or paying off my current car,"I just thought of this, and I wanted a second opinion. 

I’m a new grad making $60K, with about $26,000 in student loans. I have been driving a car that was under my parents name, but took over the loan to alleviate them in October which had a remaining balance of $11,000. The remaining balance today is about $6000. 

I currently am doing well in paying $1200 a month towards the car loan, while putting off my student loans for later, considering interest rates are paused (I live in the US). 

My thought was, if I lease a new car for $350-$400, and sell my car privately (with an estimated value of $12,000), I could put that equity (remaining $6000) into my student loans, and start tackling the $20,000 today, WHILE interest rates are paused. 

The main downside is of course I’d be leasing a car, which I know is almost never a good idea.

personalfinance,Alternatives to 401k/IRA/HSA? NQ Deferred Comp Plans Worth It?,"My current employer does not offer a 401k and offsets this by paying above market wages and solid year-end bonuses.  I am in a position to implement some type of retirement vehicle (excluding 401k) but there does not seem to be anything out there that's worth it.

NQ Deferred Comp plans seem to only make sense for those that are close to retirement given the potential massive tax hit if you switch employers.  Given my age (32) I highly doubt I will be here that long.  Is there really nothing else out there?  We will be implementing a 401k in the near future but in order to do this we must carve out our HCEs, so myself and a few other high earners will be excluded.

Are taxable brokerage accounts really my only option?  It seems insane to me that the federal government has nothing in place for employees whose employers do not offer 401ks, yet if I was self-employed I could set up my own.  Too bad I can't convert to a 1099!

personalfinance,Clarity about early loan repayments,"So I understand that when you take out a large long term loan, at some interest rate, over some period of time, you are going to pay quite a bit more than the loan amount, based on the time.

I also understand that there is a curve over the lifetime of the loan where early on, your payments are going towards the interested much more than the principal, and that curve shifts over time. I don't fully understand why this is a curve the way it is.  


My question I would like some clarity on if possible is how paying extra works on loans. When you pay more than the minimal monthly payment, does that extra go toward the principal only?   


My confusion stems from the interest vs principal curve that the payment is normally applied to over the lifetime of a loan.  


Suppose you take out a 100k loan over some period of time at some rate that you would pay 200k over the lifetime of the loan. If you make additional payments, or maybe save up for larger lump sum payments on it. Is that guaranteed to be applied to the principal only? Such that basically the curve gets recalculated across the remaining payoff time? It seems to me that if the extra payments are still utilizing the same interest/principal curve, how are you actually saving money, versus just making accelerated payments towards that 200k bloated value. Would it make more sense to just pay the normal payment, and save up for a full one time payoff?  


Basically I'm trying to understand the mechanics of early loan payoffs. Hope that makes some sense. Not sure how coherent the question is given my(probable) misunderstandings of what is going on in cases like this.

personalfinance,How best to allocate my security deposit return,"I am 23. I live in a MCOL area. I make $70000 before taxes. I just recently moved to the area from another for work, and my previous landlord has sent my security deposit return of $975 via mail. I really don't know what to do with it though. Thankfully I am able to meet all my monthly living and debt obligations, so I don't need this money to survive, however, I  don't know how to most efficiently allocate this money. 

I have already decided to earmark ~$200 of this money for a hotel to attend a friend's out-of-town wedding. So that leaves me roughly $775.

* Credit Card: I pay off the balance every payday so this is irrelevant

* Student Loans: I have roughly $37500 in SL debt, of which ~$27500 is in federal forbearance. I don't really see the point in paying the loans in forbearance.
* Private Loan 1: ~$4000 balance. 2.5% variable APR, 100 monthly payment
* Private Loan 2: ~$5750 balance. 4.35% fixed APR, 150 monthly payment
* Car Loan: ~$6000 Balance. 6% APR. 195 Monthly Payment
* Savings Account: $10000.Was about closer to $15000 pre-move, but furnishing + SD + Moving expenses+ Paying two rents for a month ate into that
* IRA: I have ~$16000 in a traditional IRA. The new job doesn't have a 401k (they have a more complicated profit-sharing plan, don't feel like getting into details). Most of that balance was the role over + vested match from the previous job. Have $5000 remaining in contributions
* Vanguard Account: I have about $4000 sitting in a brokerage account
* Consumer Debt: I furnished my home office and some home electronics (monitors, keyboard, router, etc) using a best buy store credit card. I currently pay about $80 a month on this. It has a balance of $650 of which $600 is interest deferred until May 2023 (i.e. interest-free if paid off by then). This does not appear on my credit report for some reason

My current thought process is to split that $775 up in 3 ways.
 
* $400 to Best Buy: Id rather just get that over with and not have to pay all the accumulated interest in May of next year. This will still leave me some wiggle room to use some of that other money for other purposes but will guarantee that I pay the balance off sometime in 2022.
* $275 for Savings
* $100 to IRA

Is there a better way anyone else sees of splitting this money? I would appreciate any insight into what would be a more efficient use of this money",finance,1654620788
personalfinance,Should I take out a Personal Loan to cover Credit Card Debt,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for help but after researching similar questions, I decided this Reddit may be my best chance at figuring this out. Alright, we got a debt situation here. I have tried to figure it out the past few years, but I keep sinking. I picked up a large chunk of debt for flight training and surviving until getting a job (I did what I thought was right at the time but clearly I screwed up). Here's the layout:

Credit Card debt:

1.) $12,100 (17.99%)

2.) $11,863 (19.74%)

3.) $7,883 (20.24%)

4.) $2,938 (18.24%)

Total cost for minimum payments: $1,033; Total CC Debt: $34,664

Personal Loan (13%): (4 years remaining)

$515/month

Student Loan (Federal): (5 years remaining)

$271/month (on forbearance for another two months)

Total Cost of living: $2,700 (Car is paid off)

Income varies: $3,000-$3,700 (I am a flight instructor and drive Uber Eats); plus $300/month from spouse towards credit cards

It feels like my credit card debt is getting worse with the variable interest rate and interest charges, so I checked to see if I could qualify for another personal loan (my credit has tanked from 720's to 620's over the past two years). Here's the offer:

$30,500 for 5 year loan at 25.74%APR ($27,450 after origination fees); $809/month

Obviously, it won't cover all the credit card debt, but it would take out two of the heavy hitters (the ones around $12k) and then half of the highest-interest card ($7883 down to $4200). I'm not sure if this is a good option since it doesn't cover all the credit card debt and the interest rate it higher than the credit cards, but it does seem like a way to consolidate. I'm about a year shy of the airlines (if the hiring trend continues), so I'm hoping the income situation will improve by then. The loans have no pre-payment fees, so I plan on doubling down on them at that point.

I've read briefly on the snowball method and avalanche method, but I could really use some personalized input.

Thanks!

TL;DR- I racked up credit cards and have a personal loan offer to cover 80% of it- should I take it?

Edit: I forgot to include $300/month income from Spouse towards the credit cards since they used mine in-between jobs

Edit: Thanks for the input everybody! I think it’s pretty clear I’ll need to find a new income source to make a dent and I’ll keep away from the loans. Cheers",finance,1654622100

Like the video says, it is so easy to make money in this market. You simply need to ""Buy the fucking dip, you fucking idiot."" If you don't have any money left, borrow some money at a ridiculously low interest rate and buy the dip.

If you're worried about the bigger issues at play, such as war, inflation, unemployment, fed interest hikes, etc, you need to listen to me. Buy the dip. If you don't, you are an idiot. I promise you this isn't merely artificial wealth creation.

Now, don't forget, this strategy only works if you go around and tell all your friends and family to do the same. That way, when they are buying more expensively than you, you can sell back to them and collect your money. It's basically free money.

Especially when the market is in stagnation, and you don’t gain any substantial profit. 

You might have heard about crypto loans here and there, but let’s clarify everything and dot the I.

https://preview.redd.it/8gk0pdl369491.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b47b95cb6ea4f61c02b5bfb084ce77baccb398

**How Do Crypto Loans Work?**  
When the market is stuck and you can't earn, you probably, lock the assets until the prices increase. But if there is any other option to make your money work? Crypto loans can be a solution. 

A crypto loan is a form of decentralized finance that investors can use to lend their crypto assets to borrowers who are seeking investors. In return, you'll earn interest payments or so-called 'crypto dividends.' 

The question is, why would a borrower want to borrow funds? Let's look at the example, you have Bitcoin ($BTC), and the Bitcoin market is on the rise. So, you don't want to sell it, but instead, use your Bitcoin as collateral, borrow a stablecoin such as Tether ($USDT) pegged to the U.S. dollar, and get liquidity. When you return your loan, you get your Bitcoins back, and if their value's increased in that interval, you won.  


**When Do You Need a Crypto Loan?**   
That’s a broad-spectrum of cases when you might need to use a crypto lending platform. Here are the most common:

1. **Reinvesting** — borrow your holdings against stablecoins and spend the funds to stack more of the same currencies you have.  

2. **Short-selling** — borrow your stablecoins against chosen assets and sell received cryptocurrencies at the current exchange rate.  

3. **Boost your passive income** – take out a crypto loan and add the released funds to earn more passive income;  

4. **Diversify your portfolio** — borrow your holdings against stablecoins and spend it to diversify your portfolio by adding various currencies;
5. **Daily purchases** — borrow your holdings against stablecoins, exchange them for fiat and spend for your day-to-day needs such as rent, travelling, clothes, or services without converting your crypto to fiat.

**Cryptocurrency Loan Collateral**  
Crypto lending platforms remove intermediaries in a blockchain-based ecosystem and provide crypto loan facilities. Thus, you can’t get a crypto loan without cryptocurrency as collateral. 

Borrowers have to over-collateralize their debts to protect the lender’s assets. It’s used as there are no credit checks for borrowing crypto. So, if a borrower couldn’t repay the debt, the collateral will be locked. This makes it possible for people with poor to no credit history to borrow crypto.

Another way of using collateral is to calculate an individual's lending risk and terms of the loan, such as payment period, interest rate, and amount of lendable funds. The higher the collateral, the lower lenders’ risk. 

For this, you should calculate Loan-to-Value (or LTV). LTV is the ratio of an individual’s loan value to the value of their collateral. With LTV, crypto loan providers can evaluate individual lending risk levels. 

**Is a Crypto Loan Risky?**  
Since there are benefits to using your digital currency to secure a loan, there are also some drawbacks, and here they are:

**Margin calls**: it happens when your collateral’s value decreases and the lender requires you to increase your holdings to manage the loan. 

**There isn’t access to your assets**: when your loan has an outstanding balance, you can’t access your holdings to trade or transact. 

**Repayment terms differ**: These loans usually function like traditional installment loans and depending on the crypto lending program, you may have less than a year to pay back what you borrowed. In other cases, you can create your own repayment schedule. With shorter repayment terms, it’s crucial that you know beforehand whether you can afford the payments.

**Limited assets:** it depends on the crypto lending platform you use, so you may need to swap your currency for an eligible asset that is supported by the platform.

**Account funds aren’t insured**: If you lend your own digital assets, the funds in a crypto interest account aren’t insured like your fiat money in the bank account. 

**Withdrawals can be slow**: You can request a withdrawal from your crypto interest account whenever you need it. Depending on the platform, it could take some time, though.

Time * work energy * security = fruition. Got it. 

But I was wrong. Or maybe I’m just elated that I’ve almost managed to find a way to spend some curiously salted utxos, and also recognizing that I perhaps haven’t been amazing at taking the past few years in stride. 

Regardless, I’m still here in a sort of casual awe at how it creates perfect economic seasons where money can cool off. Where people can reflect. Yes. We also need rest. We aren’t ASICS that can take data 24/7, crunch it all, and not bug out. 

Sometimes Bitcoin is worth more (ironically, bear markets, once you see it), so you work harder for it then. That’s the case going forward, maybe the next year or two. Maybe be a little harder to find cheap steaks in the meantime. 

But I can rest assured knowing that all the energy I put through a PoW system such as Bitcoin allows me to know that the work I do as a human, which I also have to align with my ethics on a personal level, will only grow in value as epochs move on. 

Then there’s the inevitable expansion of bringing in new souls to Bitcoin every epoch. We all introduce our friends and family. They come in. Then you see them bringing in folks. They are learning now too finally, and they want to understand better what the properties are at the core. 

It’s like a heartbeat sort of, but one that happens only once every four years. An expanding pulse. More people interested, but only half as much supply suddenly available on futures market, which runs in backwardation to USD. 

That’s another thing that happened since coming across Bitcoin in grad school—it’s taught me about all sorts of other markets. 

Should pretty much be always two constants of the market—Bitcoin going up (hope rising from the ashes of pseudo-governments destroying their own money) and the VIX going down (people realizing shit is probably not going to be as bad as they feared). Else=print recession. 

There will always be forks, and gambling, and hash wars, until society sort of writ large learns to respect the internet (the ultimate time machine) as a whole really for the public depository (library) of codebase that it is

But it also means that mined pristine bitcoin is maybe easier to debug than bitcoin that has been salted a few times over, as it’s moved across time, and different platforms, and shot back and forth between nodes running different rules. 

I mean, even at it’s essence, every shitcoin out there currently sitting in some strange SIMS metaverse where you use it to pay for your dry cleaning, it’s ultimately just an extended expression of the Bitcoin ledger—some history of transactions that has aged toward the graveyard of usability, by being exchanged over and over, but for the sake of novelty more than profit—over in the land of the present where every bad idea has surely been tried (let’s make a coin that tracks the supply chain, ugh) and even some good ones, have failed. 

I also suddenly get why Luke wants smaller blocks if we really want to make this something that will be attractive to people in 2070. And especially 2170. 

That sort of shit absolutely matters when you get to the point of devoting your life’s work toward using a money that is the bane of every other money’s existence. 

We aren’t just a bunch of nerds anymore. Militaries hire out kiddos like Jason Lowery these days just to better understand Bitcoin themselves. 

It literally feels like the beginning of an evolutionary bottleneck sometimes. 

And it’s why you probably want to be mining during these times of global peak energy, regardless of whether it costs a bit more where you are hashing it. 

I think this journey has simply taken me longer to understand than others who actually were competent “shadowy supercoders” back in the 1990s and 2000s. 

But now I find myself here at 40 teaching myself to code—not even for work—or to put my name in the GitHub, but to just better understand the pros and cons of every argument. And of course, to debug some of my own bitcoin, which I put through a strange self-attack of salting by not understanding some of the rules and acting carelessly over time. 

And, of course, to understand BIPs enough that I make good decisions in the future regarding how I run my node. 

Here your vote actually does matter. Like there are literally only ~50k votes, STILL, GLOBALLY, and even amongst those running nodes—some don’t even have a clue what they are doing.

They maybe just bought a Ledger last week and stored their first UTXO. Hell, maybe they never even downloaded core. Maybe they pay someone smarter than them to “vault” it for them. I can certainly grasp why people like Saylor would do it—even have to do it. 

Because, let’s face it, when you put ideas out to other humans—sometimes the bad ones prevail first, and only through growth do we adapt to better practices. How many of us especially wish that we had made one or two decisions differently over the past few years?

And Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin is still really just the longest decentralized ledger outside of some strange setups like Church or AA. 

Oh, and it’s global and free to use also. 

I will be moving somewhere outside of this energy desert (California) while the economy sort of unwinds here I think, and maybe to a place with cheaper power—with a little more nourishing environment, both spiritually, and with regards to energy conversion. 

Somewhere where time moves a little slower, helps me appreciate it for the short glimpse into other worlds I have for now. Hope to maybe buy a few miners over the next year or two and plug them in. But mostly, I want to just make sure that I can subsist off-grid too. Would love 100 acres complete with a creek I can milk for hydroelectric. 

Tons of people I’ve met since 2011 just via Bitcoin—and I think one day Bitcoiners will be one of the largest global communities there is. Reminds me honestly in some ways of Burning Man. Like some weird mix of people who were children to those who went to Woodstock—but also had some deeper fascination and frustrations with how money has been managed.

But we are also the community that isn’t ever going to forget. We’ve grown up in a world of “taxation without representation”.  And us Gen-Xers are especially miffed at being forced off the gold standard. 

Bitcoin was born precisely because humans can’t keep their grubby little fingers out of the Cheetos bag, and right now there’s a CFO somewhere thinking “yeah, but that would be considered “extreme, so they will bail us out.” Repo market how big now?

Not everyone has to get along here—there are actually some epic and long standing feuds—but you also don’t want to limit out ideas just because someone you don’t like who has them. 

The rules you run on your node are the rules your coin moving forward could be limited to in the future. If you pull a Jihan Wu, you could live to regret it pretty hard. Lot of Bitcoin got burned at the alters of misspends, Satoshi’s dice, mex, or “the next bitcoin”—basically humans just caught in a dopamine cycle of chasing. 

Ultimately, life is a journey, and with any luck—you get to enjoy your senescence. But you also want your stored money to be spendable wherever bitcoin is spendable in the future. So really, do learn from other’s mistakes here. 

You are adding risks with every salt or level of complexity you add, with every coinjoin, and even with every input you receive but don’t know the history of beforehand. 

And that’s what I learned this week, as I’ve sort of dove into how I’ve managed to lock myself out of at least three child keys of a wallet.dat file that has just been evolving across different platforms over several years while also undergoing rule changes to the repository as well as general updates I make to the computer I’ve been storing it on—like Python, OpenSSL, etc. 

Usually we do best with money when we aren’t obsessing about it. Bull markets actually make life pretty chaotic if you think about it. Took my months to figure out how to debug that shit. And yet elsewhere, someone else doesn’t even own Bitcoin.

In the end, you choose what your node accepts and sends. You are responsible for building your own firewall in life. 

Jeremy had everyone in an uproar earlier this year, and maybe that’s a good thing—maybe each time some BIP drama goes down, or someone is forced to either learn how to code, or pay someone else to debug their coin—people will be pressed to better understand what Bitcoin really is.

The most decentralized, longest running codebase of money, but that is still open to change—not where it’s going to make you, mister big pants, a bunch of money—but absolutely open to change where the improvements are obvious, properly peer reviewed, and especially necessary. 

My node (my brain as a metaphor) has admittedly been open to everything available electronically—hat tip to mIRC. Them were golden days. But I have to admit I’ve had some pretty unhealthy habits on the internet at times, and maybe even expressed autistic levels of seeking stimulation in the world of tomorrow—which has perhaps made for an extended adolescence of sorts. But that’s another thing you learn. Most adults are just old kids. 

But at least I’m old enough these days to have a few skills I can still for money to someone who will at least pay me with more of those shitty dollars—at least as long as there’s still places on earth where I can work a trade, have friends, and mine Bitcoin. Or even better—maybe I finally get a job within bitcoin that pays in Bitcoin. 

I think I spent so much time this past decade in a place of trying to compile and debug my own code in my head, so I can make solid decisions going forward—

because the speed of change isn’t slowing down anytime soon

because there are puppets out there like Janet Yellen who straight up admit that they didn’t realize adding 50% to the money supply would cause inflation

because the world is only going to keep changing—especially for Americans, as the world wakes up to their ability to pull a revolutionary assault on what money is, and even what rights are—Bitcoin is also the people of 180+ nations beginning the process of taking their money back from their governments. 

Bitcoin isn’t perfect, but it sure as shit beats slaving away to fund a life subsisting under warmongers….

having to constantly hear two bloke both lead by 100 PR agents tell people why they deserve popular trust. 

Time is a circle, unless you make bitcoin.",cryptocurrency,1654640732
stocks,"World Bank warns global economy may suffer 1970s-style stagflation, Risks of further deterioration are mounting","BY DAVID J. LYNCH

The global economy may be headed for years of weak growth and rising prices, a toxic combination that will test the stability of dozens of countries still struggling to rebound from the pandemic, the World Bank warned Tuesday.
Not since the 1970s — when twin oil shocks sapped growth and lifted prices, giving rise to the malady known as “stagflation” — has the global economy faced such a challenge.
The bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent from January’s 4.1 percent and said that “subdued growth will likely persist throughout the decade because of weak investment in most of the world.”
Fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has aggravated the global slowdown by driving up prices for a range of commodities, fueling inflation. Global growth this year will be roughly half of last year’s annualized rate and is expected to show little improvement in 2023 and 2024.
This will be the sharpest slump after an initial post-recession rebound that the global economy has suffered in more than 80 years, the bank said. And the situation could get even worse if the Ukraine war fractures global trade and financial networks or soaring food prices spark social unrest in importing countries.
“The risk from stagflation is considerable with potentially destabilizing consequences for low- and middle-income economies,” said David Malpass, president of the multilateral development institution in Washington. “ … There’s a severe risk of malnutrition and of deepening hunger and even of famine in some areas.”
If the worst outcomes materialize, global growth over the next two years could fall “close to zero,” he added.

With few exceptions, the economic outlook is troubled.
In the third year of pandemic, the global economy this year has been hit by what the World Bank labels “overlapping crises” — fallout from the war in Ukraine, recurring coronavirus lockdowns affecting Chinese factories and the highest inflation rates in decades.
For now, the greatest areas of concern lie beyond U.S. borders. A recession in Europe is a real possibility, as the continent struggles to accommodate nearly 7 million Ukrainian refugees and deal with upheavals in energy markets. Elsewhere, the interruption of grain exports via the Black Sea is hurting countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and Somalia. China is suffering from its rigid zero-covid policies and battling costly property market weakness.
Though the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of the year during the omicron variant surge, growth is expected to rebound in the current quarter, according to economists’ estimates. Financial market gauges of future inflation rates have declined since late April, easing — though not eliminating — fears of a prolonged price spiral.
Nathan Sheets, global chief economist for Citigroup, called the chance of a significant stagflation outbreak in the U.S. “remote,” in a recent client note.

Policymakers must act quickly to mitigate the Ukraine war’s consequences, help countries pay for food and fuel, and accelerate promised debt relief, while avoiding “distortionary policies” such as price controls and export bans, the bank said.
The World Bank’s Malpass said the global economy is being hampered by inadequate production capacity for key goods. “It’s very important to increase supply massively to really try to get at inflation directly by more production. Unfortunately, there aren’t signs of that very much yet,” he said.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted global energy markets, threatening Europe with recession and straining the budgets of countries that import large quantities of oil, natural gas, coal and fertilizer, the bank said.
As Europe weans itself from Russian energy products, its purchases from alternative suppliers competes with orders from existing customers, limiting available supplies.

Investors also could take a beating from a repeat of ‘70s-style stagflation. The S&amp;P 500 stock index, already down more than 13 percent this year, could lose an additional 20 percent or more, according to a recent client note from Bank of America.
Led by the United States, the world roared out of the pandemic downturn with its fastest growth since 1973, a 5.7 percent gain. The global economy was expected to struggle this year as it adjusted to the loss of pandemic-era government spending and ultralow interest rates. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and continued coronavirus flare-ups — have made the situation tougher.

The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has jumped to nearly $120, up almost 50 percent this year. And wheat has staged a similar rally, leading the bank to call for urgent action to ease “worldwide food shortages.”
The World Bank’s downbeat forecast adds to concerns about global weakness. Most major stock markets, including those in the United States, are in the red so far this year. And the bank’s sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, lowered its global forecast in April.
With the U.S., and most other major economies suffering the highest inflation in 40 years, many economists in recent months have cited the danger of a 1970s rerun.",finance,1654642670

I am struggling to understand the interest rate buckets in TIAA. It seems like ALL the existing funds reset once a year in March. This year they reset from 3 to 3.5%. However there also appears to be a monthly adjustment for NEW investments. For instance, this month it pays 4%. 

Am I understanding this correctly? Does this mean that the majority of my funds are at 3.5% and my last installment in early June gets 4%? This would hold true with monthly adjustments for new installments until March 2023 when the ENTIRE investment gets reset to a new amount (up or down).

If this is accurate and I am now trying to sell TIAA for bonds, how do I make sure that I am selling buckets with the lower rates and not 4%. As opposed to a brokerage account I was not able to find specific lots to sell.

worldpolitics,Fox News Doesn't Plan To Carry Jan 6 Hearings Live,"By Jeremy W. Peters and John Koblin  
June 7, 2022Updated 7:50 p.m. ET  
The group of lawmakers investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot would like as many Americans as possible to learn jarring and unknown details about the attack. So they decided to hold  a public hearing on Thursday during prime time, when many people are sitting in front of their TVs.  
Fox News, the nation’s top cable news channel, has other plans.  
When the hearing begins at 8 p.m. Eastern, NBC will go into special report mode. CBS will air a special called “Capitol Assault Hearings,” while ABC will run “Attack on the Capitol: The Investigation — An ABC News Special.” MSNBC and CNN will have wall-to-wall coverage all night.  
But Fox News will not carry the hearing. Instead, the network will stick with its prime-time lineup of opinionated conservative hosts: Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, who have repeatedly downplayed the assault as a mere “footnote” to American history and tried to discredit the congressional inquiry as a ruse to “purge” former President Donald J. Trump and his supporters from the Republican Party.  
The network said on Monday that its prime-time hosts would cover the event “as news warrants.” Live news coverage will be left to Fox Business, a sister network with much smaller viewership. Last month, Fox News averaged 1.5 million viewers at any given time during the day; Fox Business averaged 136,000. Mr. Carlson regularly draws more than three million viewers for his show at 8 p.m.  
Republicans in Washington and conservative commentators across right-wing media have attacked the committee’s hearings — the one on Thursday is one of at least six that are planned — as partisan political theater, produced by Democrats to enhance their chances in the midterm elections.  
That is the view among many inside Fox News, including its top-rated talent. They have watched their ratings soar as the network abandoned the more straightforward tone it took immediately after the 2020 election and then leaned hard into the grievances and misleading claims propagated by Republicans who want to rewrite the history of Mr. Trump’s loss and its aftermath.  
Not broadcasting the hearing sends a message to loyal Fox viewers, media observers said: The network won’t help legitimize a process that many conservatives see as a kangaroo court.

“To walk away from what is surely going to be on every cable station and the networks, it’s impossible to believe it’s anything other than trying to make a statement by not showing up,” said Carl Cameron, the former chief political correspondent at Fox News, who left in 2017 and has since been critical of the network.  
Fox News, like the Republican Party, has changed over the past few years. It is less tolerant of dissenting voices and more willing to air unsupported claims. It has let go or sidelined on-air personalities critical of Mr. Trump. Others have quit in protest, including two conservative writers who said they were appalled by a documentary, starring Mr. Carlson, that promoted the unfounded idea that the Jan. 6 riot was a so-called false flag operation meant to persecute conservatives.  
Nicole Hemmer, a historian at Columbia University and the author of “Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics,” said the Fox News decision to put the Jan. 6 committee hearing on its smaller platforms fit into a larger conservative argument that the insurrection was “not that big of a deal.”  
“To air it on their tiny sister network, they are reinforcing that argument: This isn’t important,” she said.  
Fox News disputed that claim on Tuesday, saying the hearing will be available to its audience in several ways. The coverage on Fox Business will be led by Bret Baier, Fox News’s most prominent host who is not overtly partisan, along with Martha MacCallum. That programming will also run on the Fox News website as well as on Fox’s streaming service, Fox Nation. Mr. Baier and Ms. MacCallum will appear on Fox News after prime time with an 11 p.m. posthearing special.  
The network also pointed to its past coverage, in full, of other sessions from Capitol Hill, such as Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Those were daytime events.  
By not carrying the hearings live in prime time, Fox News is potentially sparing itself an awkward on-screen moment. Private communications between several Fox anchors and the Trump administration were unearthed during the Jan. 6 committee investigation. Multiple messages show how the hosts were deeply concerned about the rioters and Mr. Trump’s refusal to rebuke them on the day of the attack.  
In text messages, Mr. Hannity, Ms. Ingraham and Brian Kilmeade, a host of the morning show “Fox &amp; Friends,” expressed growing alarm to Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, as the attack played out. “He is destroying his legacy,” Ms. Ingraham wrote in one message obtained by the committee.  
The other major TV networks plan to cover the hearing with their highest-profile journalists. The broadcast networks will call in their evening news anchors — David Muir, Lester Holt and Norah O’Donnell — to lead two hours of coverage. CNN will turn to Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper, along with a small army of reporters and correspondents. Rachel Maddow, Nicolle Wallace and Joy Reid will anchor the coverage on MSNBC.  
Separately, in a decision that could affect more viewers, the Fox broadcast network will not direct its affiliates, which reach many millions more homes than Fox News, to show the hearing. They “will be offered” coverage of the hearing, Fox News Media said, but not mandated to take it, as is often the case with major events like a presidential address.  
Given the highly polarized view that Americans have taken of the select committee’s work, it is unclear that Fox News’s usual viewers would tune in at all. They have punished the network in the past for coverage that did not toe the line. Its ratings fell sharply after Fox News became the first network in 2020 to call Arizona for President Biden, effectively declaring him the winner of the election, and then declined to promote the wildest claims of voter fraud. Newsmax, a conservative cable news channel that was more willing to broadcast questionable stories about fraud at the polls, saw its ratings surge temporarily.  
Only after Mr. Biden was inaugurated, and Fox News anchors like Mr. Carlson began to cast events like Jan. 6 as a partisan smoke screen exploited by Democrats, did the network’s ratings rebound.  
“The base isn’t clamoring to tune in, because they agree that Jan. 6 hearings are just a political stage show and that Jan. 6 has been blown out of proportion,” Ms. Hemmer of Columbia said.  
During the Trump presidency and his two campaigns, Fox News was often caught between its audience and its notion of itself as an independent, conservative voice in media.  
Egged on by Mr. Trump, conservatives pounced when they thought a Fox host like Megyn Kelly was unfairly critical of him. To this day, he complains that Fox treats him poorly because it doesn’t air his political rallies live and in full. He has gloated about the network’s ratings crash after the 2020 election, noting of Fox’s audience, “They don’t want to hear negativity toward me.”  
With the decision to limit coverage of the Jan. 6 hearing this week, Fox News is sending a clear signal that it is siding with this audience.  
﻿  
Mr. Carlson called the committee “grotesque” on his program Monday night. Mr. Hannity has called the group of five Democrats and two Republicans “fake” on his 9 p.m. show.  
“You will not hear the real story of Jan. 6 anywhere, I don’t think, except here,” Mr. Hannity said on Monday night.

One of the salesmen told me not to pay too much attention to EnergySage marketplace averages, but I’m not sure that was unbiased advice. I’ve narrowed it down to the following two, from reputable installers in my area.

__Option 1__


System size: 7.03 kW

Panels: Sunpower SPR-415

Inverter: Enphase microinverters (built in Sunpower microinverters, I believe they’re the same product but rebranded)

Inverter: SolarEdge SE7600H-US

Cash price (before incentive): $23,400

Price per Watt: $3.25


Is Sunpower worth the extra cost? The only reason I’m thinking extra hard about it is because of the Sunpower “1 warranty” system, and the fact that the installer who gave me option 2 does not install Enphase microinverters whatsoever. I’ve read quite a bit about SolarEdge inverters having a high failure rate, so that’s keeping me from going with option 2.

Hypothetically, if I could get the SunPower system for less than $3.80 per Watt (before federal tax incentive), would that be worth the premium at that point?",energy,1654658556
vet,Fecal Incontinence after Anesthesia?,"Hi, Vets 😥

My 8 year old Chiweenie went in for a dental cleaning today. She was under anesthesia for the procedure. She had some excess gum tissue removed as well. 

Now that we’re home, and it’s after hours for our vet, she is pooping herself without meaning to. Little, intermittent spurts of poo. Her little booty looks really irritated and I feel so bad for her. And there seems to be small traces of blood - The color of her poo is a reddish brown. But it’s not a jellylike consistency. Just plain, ole diarrhea. 

She seems to be behaving normally with no noticeable changes in behavior. She is epileptic and takes zonisamide twice a day. ￼

She ate without issue - water softened kibble. She was very hungry and ate it all. She’s drinking water on her own. I haven’t given her any pepto because I don’t want it to interfere with the round of antibiotics she’s on. 

This has not happened before when she’s had procedures done in the past. She has always come out of them just fine. She was prescribed halfed tablets of caprofen and clindamycin. 

Should I try to get in touch with a vet? But I also don’t want to bother them with this if it’s a pretty common reaction. And I tend to be a worrier.

EDIT TO ADD: We ended up getting her an anti diarrheal medication at the vet’s today. She is eating normally, drinking water, and also not pooping on herself today! It must have just been the anesthesia.",cryptocurrency,1654660361

**So how much retirement savings does a person need to retire safely, making sure they don’t run out of money?** 

As someone with relatively simple tastes and I’ve always imagined that with a nest egg of $2,000,000 I wouldn’t have trouble retiring without touching the principal. I came to this conclusion by using the 4% rule — a conservative investing rule that seems more like a rule of the universe than any specific thing someone came up with. But there is, of course, a history to the 4% rule. 

**The History of The 4% Rule**

William Bengan, a financial advisor, first devised the 4% retirement rule in 1994. Since then it has been in the air as a fairly cautious approach to retirement spending. According to his original paper (linked below) withdrawing 4% of your portfolio (adjusted for inflation, so starting with 4% and increasing distributions slightly each year to adjust) would have protected retirees from running out of money during every 30-year period since 1926, even considering the Great Depression. 

The 4% rule dictates that you should able to safely withdraw 4% from a 50% stock / 50% bonds retirement portfolio without risking the principle too much. So the 4% rule has typically been thought of as a safe, conservative drawdown strategy to aim for, but if you needed to, you could probably let your withdrawals creep up to 5% or so. Here’s the theory:

Stocks have historically yielded between 8-10%. SP500 has yielded an average annual return of 10.49% since its inception in 1957 (it actually existed in some form, only 90 stocks originally, as far back as 1926, but we won’t go there). The Dow Jones has yielded an AAR of 7.75% in the last hundred years (since 1921) without adjusting for dividends, which is currently yielding 1.81% because of some big dividends yielders like IBM, Verizon and 3M. So that nets out to 9.56% for the DOW. Let’s take the lower of these two and call stock performance 9.5% on average. 

Bonds are trickier to calculate. We have been in a declining bond yield environment for 38 years — (bonds were paying 13.75% in 1984). I downloaded a historical 10 year treasury 54-year historical dataset and ran the average, which came in at 5.9%. If we use a shorter average (we have the data set, why not), for the last 20 years we get 2.92%. They are currently paying 3.04%. So let’s use 3% which seems fair. 

Now that we have our historical rates of return, let’s figure out what our hypothetical $2,000,000 nest egg will earn us.

**The 4% Rule In Action**

We’ve divided our portfolio into 50% stocks and 50% bonds, so we can easily average 3% and 9.5% and get 6.25%. 6.25% will earn us $62,500 per million in the bank, so our hypothetical retirement portfolio should increase by $125,000 per year without us touching it. But, of course, we do want to touch it. We need it to produce enough income to live on. Recent census data shows that the median retirement income in 2021 for retirees 65 and older is $47,357. The 4% rule dictates that we can withdraw $40,000 per million, or $80,000 per year, safely from out $2,000,000 portfolio. Great! That doesn’t even account for social security income or any other income we might have in retirement. With this calculation we have a 2.25% margin of safety, too, which should allow our investments to continue to grow as the cost of living increases, or if there are any unexpected extra expenses. 

Are we forgetting anything? 

**How does inflation impact the 4% rule**

We should probably factor in inflation. William Bengen, who retired in 2013, has recently spoken up and has cautioned that the 4% rule may not work anymore. Historical inflation since 1913 has averaged at 3.1%, but as it is currently at 8.3% it increases the chances that the portfolio will be depleted during retirement, unless stocks and bonds average &gt;12% yields annually. 

Even prior to inflation becoming a big issue, bonds were starting to lose their luster as an attractive place to park your money. Bengen now recommends that retirees reduce their exposure to stocks and bonds. I would love to talk to him and see which assets he prefers. The article I read mentioned holding cash and trying to buy the dips in equities and buying income-producing real estate. The issue I see with this is that we have now forcing everyday retirees into becoming real estate investors and asset managers. I’m not sure this is wise or productive. The whole point of retirement savings is that they should work for you without being actively managed. The article ended with suggesting 3.3% withdraw rate rather than 4% without really justifying that number. I wasn’t satisfied. 

**The Model**

I built a model with a 30-year time horizon his portfolio is healthy — it actually continues to earn money through retirement, ending with higher yearly expenses of $144,908 but also higher income (and SS payments, indexed to inflation) so it all works out. Ending balance after 30 years is around $3,000,000 — more than we started with. 

Then I made inflation average at 5%. The first 12 years the portfolio grows — peaking out at 2.31 million, and then it starts shrinking. That’s okay — that’s how retirement goes, usually — at some point you will probably dig into the principal. But the expenses keep growing quite a bit faster than the income, and by year 30 the portfolio is down to $316,000 — and expenses are up to $345,755. So we only have a year of wiggle room. 

Dare I try 8.3%? 

Same story — first 7 years are positive, then it dives — quickly. In the middle of year 21 the assets are depleted. Year 22 requires $426,862 to maintain the same lifestyle that $80,000 bought in year 1. 

**Conclusion**

Inflation is good for debtors and bad for savers and for people on fixed incomes. Retirees are the cross section of these two groups. So how can we plan for a future with this inflation? I have some thoughts, — interest rate arbitrage, inflation protected bonds (I-Bonds), and yes, real estate, but it’ll have to wait for another episode. There’s plenty of time, and lots to talk about, I assure you. See you next time.

retirement,How is inflation affecting the 4% rule?,"For this post/podcast I have created a simple model retirement portfolio. This was actually a project for a friend, and the results were a bit surprising so I thought I would share it. A link to the model is below and the podcast is linked in case you don't want to read the whole post.

[https://anchor.fm/philip-wells3/episodes/How-is-inflation-affecting-the-4-retirement-rule-e1jlkmd](https://anchor.fm/philip-wells3/episodes/How-is-inflation-affecting-the-4-retirement-rule-e1jlkmd)

When it comes to retirement, even the most risk-tolerant people tend to become more risk averse. Running out of money in retirement is just not something most people want to risk.

**So how much retirement savings does a person need to retire safely, making sure they don’t run out of money?**

As someone with relatively simple tastes and I’ve always imagined that with a nest egg of a couple million dollars I wouldn’t have trouble retiring without touching the principal. I came to this conclusion by using the 4% rule — a conservative investing rule that seems more like a rule of the universe than any specific thing someone came up with. But there is, of course, a history to the 4% rule.

**The History of The 4% Rule**

William Bengan, a financial advisor, first devised the 4% retirement rule in 1994. Since then it has been in the air as a fairly cautious approach to retirement spending. According to his original paper (linked in the show notes) withdrawing 4% of your portfolio (adjusted for inflation, so starting with 4% and increasing distributions slightly each year to adjust) would have protected retirees from running out of money during every 30-year period since 1926, even considering the Great Depression.

The 4% rule dictates that you should able to safely withdraw 4% from a 50% stock / 50% bonds retirement portfolio without risking the principle too much. So the 4% rule has typically been thought of as a safe, conservative drawdown strategy to aim for, but if you needed to, you could probably let your withdrawals creep up to 5% or so. Here’s the theory:

**Historical Yields of SP500, DOW and Bonds**

Stocks have historically yielded between 8-10%. SP500 has yielded an average annual return of 10.49% since its inception in 1957 (it actually existed in some form, only 90 stocks originally, as far back as 1926, but we won’t go there).

______

Hi all,

As my first DCF with the community, I'll be writing about Waste Management.  Before I begin, I'd like to state my intentions with this post.

First, I am by no means a professional investor.  I do this for fun.  Do not make any decisions based on my work and please do your own due diligence.

Second, while I am happy to do the heavy lifting, this is a community exercise.  I will post my initial findings, but I want the community to challenge my assumptions.  If I am wrong about something, please let me know.  Criticism is fine and encouraged.  

Since my intention is to produce a large number of these for the community, I won't be digging too deep unless I see a compelling opportunity.  My goal is to get into the ballpark of a fair value as there is a sacrifice of quality in the name of quantity.  As I am not digging deep on most stocks, there is a greater chance that my assumptions are not fair (though if I'm not looking further into a company, it's typically because I believe the difference between my initial valuation and an accurate valuation is too great and my time would be better spent elsewhere).  

If I see an opportunity that is interesting, I will spend a much greater amount of time on the stock and will stop producing daily DCFs for a while.

The above points will be listed with every post.

As for the DCF, I produce it using a 10 year history of a company's income statements.  I will assume an interest rate of 2% and make my discount rate assumption based on recent debt offerings by the company.  I may need to increase the interest rate in the future, but I will continue using 2% for the time being.  I also look for irregularities and points of possible concern in the balance sheet.  Within the Cash flow statement, I use it when making an investment decision, but it does not come into play within my DCF.

Without further adieu, here we go.

Waste Management is a provider of waste management environmental services including: Collection, Landfill, Transfer, Recycling and Other lines of business.  They trade on the NYSE at a SP of $159.8.  They have a Mkt Cap of $66B.  Based on my initial DCF for WM, they are overvalued by more than 100%.  As such, I have limited my review to 10 years of income statements, one year of press releases, and the 2021 annual report.  Had WM seemed more compelling, there are many more details that I'd want to investigate which would require reading additional reports, reviewing earnings calls, investigating management, looking at publicly available employee feedback, etc, but alas, this is a pretty brief and simplified DCF so that I can spend tomorrow looking at another company that I hope will provide a more interesting story.

Attached below is a DCF for WM:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wTaLVChUTW7l_-1eMn5JcirG7Mjg8dbyyd_gT85FkPU/edit?usp=sharing

Within, we see that WM can expect long term growth of roughly 3.1%.  COGS generally trails revenue by .3%.  While this growth isn't exceptional, it is fairly reasonable considering that the waste industry is both mature and stable.  The majority of revenue growth comes from their collection business rather than their disposal business, albeit neither number is overly exciting.

There is limited opportunity to drive revenue growth within the control of the company.  Revenue can grow through acquisition, higher commodity prices for recyclables, and more favourable terms with municipalities.  Acquisitions would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis.  In the case of commodities, given their cyclical nature, we can not expect this to provide long-term growth, but rather to come in short 2 to 3 year bursts. 

Share repurchasing will continue in a limited capacity with an average buyback rate of 1%.  This honestly seems like a good use of excess cash given their limited opportunities for growth. They could pay down debt, but their debt terms are very favourable, thus there is no rush.

Some closing remarks about WM:

I suspect WM is overvalued because it is a strong and reliable business.  The company has a tremendous moat and incredibly steady, predictable growth.  These traits can lead to a company trading at a premium.  I am not a buyer at this price and given its industry and reputation, I suspect it will never get to a price where I am a buyer.  With that said, if you have this stock in your portfolio, are not trying to chase higher returns, and you plan on holding it until you retire, this truly seems like a ""set it and forget it"" stock that will allow you to sleep comfortably at night.  This stock seems fine in the long-run, but is not of interest to me at this time.

I am trying to drive a BLDC motor using FOC algorithm.  As shown in the figure, I have implemented an RPM controller on top of current control loop of FOC, where the output of RPM PI controller is directly fed to the Iqset of FOC block and Idset is kept at 0.

Problem: I want Iqset to vary form 0 to 60A but this value is low, even at the stalling load Iqset reaches to only 4 to 5A. I have tried different values of Kp and Ki for tuning the RPM controller but unable to achieve the desired result.

I don't know where i am wrong, any help would highly be appreciated.

Further experimental Info: I have tried setting the Iqset at 0.25A just to eliminate the RPM controller, in that case motor runs at full speed with no problem. That brings my attention to the RPM controller but i don't know where i am wrong.

personalfinance,How much should I expect to pay in taxes for savings on loans/ CCs?,"For example, if my original loan was $14k at 8.5% rate and I settled it for $6k with no further interest rate, and I finished the new terms this year (i.e. I finished paying the $6k), how much should I expect to have to pay in taxes for those savings?

This is my biggest account settled, the rest were CCs less than $3K originally and settled for $1,500 or less, again with no further interest accumulation. Total debt was around $30k and in the end everything was negotiated down for a total of just under $15k. 

I had been paying in installments for about a year and recently used my tax returns to pay off the remainder of the debt (which worked out to be close to the amount on my return). 

Is the ""forgiven amount"" just the difference, the difference + interest for 1 year, the difference + interest for X years...?

personalfinance,questions about being approved by 2 credit unions for auto loan,"My car finally tanked out and has a bunch of issues and not worth repairing (yes I know the market is crazy). Im looking at 2 differnet credit unions and looking to finance something reasonable. Both credit unions do fiance older vehicles. CU1 does this at a much higher interest rate, but has no mileage restrictions, while CU2 does this at a lower rate but has a mileage restriction of under 125k miles. In regards to there newer then 2012 financing they are comparable in rates.

The reason I ask this is there are definitely some reliable vehicles under 2012 Ive seen on the market (2001-2006 tundra being one of them, bulletproof trucks). Ive seen one that looks good (of course I would get a pre purchase inspection) for around 8k (which while a little higher then there pre covid prices is a great price for todays market).

My main question is this, can I get approved for both credit unions and just use whichever is best based on the milage of whatever I find, or Is it  you get approved for one you and your married to then. I always buy my cars cash and have only had experince financing with my wifes car years ago. 

Correct me if Im wrong, but if both CUs will approve me I can shop around with both of thier wallets so to speak during their 60 day approval window and make the final decision of which CU I purchase with when I find the car Im looking for.

Basically Id rather go with CU#2 but would like to have the option of CU#1 just in case I need it.

I’m pretty fed up at this point, I want my warranty certificate for my record. 
Is this how it’s going to be if I ever need warranty service and my installer is no longer around? My 25 year warranty is useless if no one is there to monitor requests/any carry out the work.

Bitcoin,Can Bitcoin Help A People Defend Against A Fiat Tyranny?,"This is a question about Bitcoin and war efforts. I broadly understand the argument for why Bitcoin can promote peace in the world, such as that an invading force can't take it by conquering land, that Bitcoin can flee across borders without detection, and most important to my question, that tyrannical governments can't fund endless wars on a Bitcoin standard, because they can't print Bitcoin.

But it's that final point that makes me wonder. In the case of a country or people that relies upon Bitcoin as its legal tender and reserve asset versus a country willing to print its state enforced fiat in order to fund war by robbing its citizens wealth and productivity... wouldn't the fiat tyranny have an advantage?

An example would be the American Civil War. The South had many powerful contingents that were not supportive of an overarching debt based currency to fund the war effort, they argued that breaking from a Gold standard was immoral, and some historians place that as central to its defeat - The North essentially outspent The South because their side was supportive of payment through federal IOUs. Obviously I'm not saying anything in regards to the morality of The South's stance on slavery, just the difference in funding of their war efforts.

So that's my concern. Hypothetically, if we Bitcoiners are to defend territory at some point in the future, against powerful governments willing to undermine their people and economies to extend their capacity to wage war against us, would we not hit the wall sooner than they?",cryptocurrency,1654712575

solar,SMA inverters: Better reliability but no panel level monitoring. Good tradeoff?,"I'm shopping for a ballpark 7kw roof solar system in the sunny and hot SoCal  desert.  No trees or other shading issues on our roof, except we may lose some sun before true sunset, due to nearby mountains to the west.

I can get a SMA Sunny Boy system for $2.50 per watt, before the federal  tax credit is even deducted.  My SolarEdge and Enphase system quotes  range from $3.35 - $4.35 per watt.

Pros for SMA Sunny Boy as I understand them:

1. Notably better reliability, especially vs SolarEdge apparently.
2. Simpler architecture so fewer things like micro inverters and optimizers on the roof to go wrong and cause headaches.
3. Faster parts replacement processing.
4. String level monitoring from a cell phone.  If a panel goes out, its  string is impacted and the homeowner who checks can see this or (I  think?) be auto-alerted to this via email.
5. Less expensive as noted (though installer markup is a factor here too).
6. Integrated Rapid Shutdown seems to be available (at last).
7. SMA automatically notified if something fails (or is about to fail) and ticket created and replacement part shipped.

Cons:

1. No panel level monitoring.
2. Ten year warranty (vs 12 for SolarEdge or 25 for Enphase).

Is this tradeoff worth it?  I tend to think so.

* *Interest Rate*: 12.00%
* *Principle Referred Interest*: $50.82
* *Referred Balance*: $292.82

Does that mean $50.82 was tacked on to my balance just for being ""referred"" to the collections agency?  


And does the 12% interest get compounded every month or year?  


Lastly, I've read that paying off a collections bill won't do much for your credit score as it's the derogatory mark on your score from being sent to collections in the first place that affects the score.  


Given that I have a couple of low-limit credit cards that I'm focused on paying off atm, I'm leaning towards getting the balance on my two cards to below 10% and then paying the collections bill, which will probably be in a month and a half. As long as the interest on the bill doesn't make my bill balance go up by $50 or anything crazy like that.

Someone recently mentioned porting a mortgage - which is essentially transferring your loan from one home to another with the same lender.
I called my mortgage loan company (chase) and they claimed they can't do it. But when I look online it seems like most fixed rate loans are eligible.
Any advice on this would be much appreciated.",finance,1654720129

Address by President Charles Michel at the UN Security Council on peace and security in Ukraine

I was born in Belgium in the 1970s. At school, we studied the great European artists. Names like Victor Hugo, da Vinci, Shakespeare, Picasso, Goethe. But we also studied masterpieces by names like Dostoevsky, Kandinsky, Tchaikovsky, Tolstoy and others. Great Russian artists from Russia’s great culture. They have influenced and inspired my own education. But today, Russia’s savagery stands in stark contrast to the heritage of these brilliant artists.

A few months ago, I was in Borodyanka where atrocities were committed by Russian soldiers. War crimes. Crimes against humanity. These crimes must be, and will be, punished to hold accountable those responsible. We need evidence. And this is why we are now helping to collect the evidence of these crimes. Impunity is not an option, and we welcome the International Court of Justice provisional measures ordering Russia to suspend military operations immediately. We fully support the investigation of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the work of the independent Commission of Inquiry. And the European Union is assisting the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and Civil Society to collect evidence of war crimes.

&gt;We hear reports of Russian forces wielding sexual violence as a weapon of war. Sexual violence is a war crime. A crime against humanity. A tactic of torture, terror and repression. Shameful acts in a shameful war. And this must be exposed to the light of day and prosecuted without impunity.

Women, peace, security. This is a critical and timely subject. Two years ago, Secretary-General Guterres called to end violence both on the battlefield and in homes. Yet as we speak, we hear reports of Russian forces wielding sexual violence as a weapon of war. Sexual violence is a war crime. A crime against humanity. A tactic of torture, terror and repression. Shameful acts in a shameful war. And this must be exposed to the light of day and prosecuted without impunity.

This war has also caused millions to flee their homes and seek refuge outside Ukraine, mostly women and children. I met many of them when I went to Ukraine, when I went to Poland, when I went to Moldova. And they are particularly vulnerable to human traffickers. We, the EU, are committed to protecting them and to keeping them safe, without any discrimination.

I have listened carefully to what has been said by some of you around the table. We intend to provide education, health and access to the labour market. And we are also working to eradicate trafficking, to protect people fleeing the war. Sadly, sexual and gender-based violence is a global threat used as a weapon of war and faced by women and girls across the world. Afghanistan. Ethiopia. The Democratic Republic of Congo. The Central African Republic. Myanmar. South Sudan. Yemen and other countries.

&gt;A few months ago, I was in Borodyanka where atrocities were committed by Russian soldiers. War crimes. Crimes against humanity. These crimes must be, and will be, punished to hold accountable those responsible. Impunity is not an option

And this is why we will host, together with UN Women, Dr. Mukwege Foundation and Nadia’s Initiative, the second conference on Women in Conflict in just a few days, in Brussels. I sincerely hope we can build momentum and step up our collective efforts to seriously address this critical issue.

Mr. Ambassador of the Russian Federation, let’s be honest. The Kremlin is using food supplies as a stealth missile against developing countries. The dramatic consequences of Russia’s war are spilling over across the globe. And this is driving up food prices, pushing people into poverty and destabilising entire regions. Russia is solely responsible for this food crisis, Russia alone. Despite the Kremlin’s campaign of lies and disinformation. I have seen it with my own eyes. A few weeks ago in Odesa, millions of tons of grain and wheat stuck in containers and ships because of Russian warships in the Black Sea and because of Russia’s attack on transport infrastructure. And it is Russian tanks, Russian bombs and mines that are preventing Ukraine from planting and harvesting.

The Kremlin is also targeting grain storage and stealing grain in Ukraine while shifting the blame on others. This is cowardly. This is pure and simple propaganda. Let’s get to the facts. The EU has no sanctions on the agricultural sector in Russia. Zero. And even our sanctions on the Russian transport sector do not go beyond our EU borders. \[You may leave the room, maybe it’s easier not to listen to the truth Mr. Ambassador\]. Our sanctions do not prevent Russian flagged vessels from carrying grain, food or fertilisers to developing countries. The EU, on the contrary, is doing all it can to help Ukraine’s agricultural exports and to support Ukraine’s agricultural sector for the coming season.

&gt;The Kremlin is using food supplies as a stealth missile against developing countries. The dramatic consequences of Russia’s war are spilling over across the globe. And this is driving up food prices, pushing people into poverty and destabilising entire regions. The Kremlin is also targeting grain storage and stealing grain in Ukraine while shifting the blame on others.

Global food security is a top priority for the EU, and we will do everything we can to help solve this challenge and to help the developing countries. And to do this, we need to unlock the Black Sea. We fully support Secretary-General Guterres’s efforts to find solutions to re-open maritime routes for Ukraine’s exports. We will actively contribute to the work of the Global Crisis Response Group and will cooperate with the G-7 and with the African Union.

The Kremlin may prohibit and prosecute the use of the word “war”, but that does not change the heartbreaking reality. Thousands of dead Ukrainian women, children and men. Atrocities. Rapes. Countless Ukrainian cities bombed into rubble. This is a war. A barbaric war waged by a permanent member of this Council.

Mr Ambassador of Ukraine: We will continue to back Ukraine. We will continue to support your country and your people. And we will continue to pressure Russia and confront Russia with the truth. Russia is attacking one country, one people, Ukraine. But Russia is also attacking the values and principles of this house. Human dignity, tolerance, multilateral cooperation and international law. These are our shared values, the bedrock of this house. So this is more than a war against one nation. It is a war against all that we have built over generations since World War II.

The EU’s commitment to the UN charter is unwavering. The European Union is a reliable, loyal and respectful partner. We will continue to cooperate on the global stage to build a safer, freer and more prosperous world.

personalfinance,Better use of money: pay off student loans or recast mortgage?,"We just bought our first house last year and have $50k in federal student loans at 7% and 400k on our mortgage at 3.125%. We have about 30k saved specifically for the student loans to pay off when payments resume. My question is would it make more financial sense to use that money and pay down the bulk of student loans when interest freeze stops, or apply towards the principal of our mortgage in a recast?

The reason I can’t tell the difference is that while the student loan has a higher interest, it’s all simple interest and we can make more than the minimum payment each month. The mortgage still has PMI on it (we borrowed 85%) and are early into the loan (few months). I figure the extra principal applied now at an although lower interest rate will affect compound interest a lot better.

I figure we’ll pay a couple hundred dollars less each month on our mortgage and will give us a safety net in future years on our payments.",finance,1654722496
MachineLearning,[P] GPT3 generation of news stories about AI,"Here's a fun little project I did today on a whim. I happen to have access to the OpenAI API, so I used their playground feature to generate AI headlines with their taglines. I fed it this prompt (sourced from the latest edition of [Last Week in AI](https://lastweekin.ai/); I co-run it, apologies for the plug):

&gt; Last week's top AI news:   
\* Caltech unit creates AI helping drones to withstand violent winds - ""Caltech researchers are developing a drone with rapidly reacting artificial intelligence (AI) capacities that allow it to adapt in flight to extreme wind similar to tornado or hurricane conditions.""   
\* How Deep Squeak, an AI program with a weird name, is detecting whales - ""Artificial Intelligence is booming. And now an AI program is being used to search for whales.""   
\* Ex-golf pro links with Seattle-area AI experts on app that uses 3D motion analysis to improve game - ""Before you take yet another mulligan, consider that the tool to improving your golf game might not be found in your bag of clubs."" 

And it did a pretty good job coming up with random other news stories just by generating text from the prompt: 

&gt; \* Google’s DeepMind creates AI that can beat humans at hide-and-seek - ""A new artificial intelligence program developed by Google’s DeepMind can beat humans at hide-and-seek, according to a new paper.""   
\* Researchers Develop AI System That Can Learn New Skills by Watching YouTube Videos - ""Researchers at the University of Maryland have developed an artificial intelligence system that can learn new skills by watching YouTube videos.""   
\* Carnegie Mellon Researchers Develop AI System That Can Help You Write Better Emails - ""Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed an artificial intelligence system that can help you write better emails.""   
\* New AI System Can Help You Find a Job You’ll Love - ""A new artificial intelligence system developed by researchers at the University of Toronto can help you find a job you’ll love, according to a new study."" 

Though, I was surprised to find it repeats itself super quickly. Would have thought GPT-3 had solved this very basic language model problem... It also seems to repeat actual news stories from the past, such as:

&gt;\* Google DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero AI can teach itself Go and other games in hours - ""DeepMind has created an artificial intelligence system that can not only defeat humans at the game of Go, but also teach itself to play from scratch within hours.""  

I also tried prompting it with just ""Last week's top AI news:"" and got the following:

&gt; 1. Google's DeepMind has created a new algorithm that can predict how proteins will fold.    
&gt;  
&gt;2. Facebook's artificial intelligence research lab has developed a new system that can automatically generate 3D models of objects from 2D images.    
&gt;  
&gt;3. IBM has announced that its Watson AI platform will now be available to developers on the IBM Cloud.    
&gt;  
&gt;4. Microsoft has released a new toolkit that allows developers to build chatbots using the company's Azure cloud platform.  

Lastly, how about ""This week's trending AI papers"" as a prompt. Also not bad:

&gt; 1. ""Deep Learning for Recommender Systems""    
&gt;  
&gt;2. ""A Neural Network Approach to Context-Aware Query Suggestion""    
&gt;  
&gt;3. ""Learning Deep Representations of Fine-Grained Visual Concepts""    
&gt;  
&gt;4. ""Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention""   


A while back I fine-tuned GPT-2 on 100 weeks' worth of AI news (see this [post](https://www.skynettoday.com/digests/ai-news-analysis)), and got some comparatively more amusing stuff:

&gt;Researchers develop a traffic light for self-driving cars  - A pair of new papers from University of Tokyo Institute of  Technology researchers and the World Health Organization claim to have  addressed one of the great challenges of artificial intelligence:  traffic lights. Thanks to machine learning, they can illuminate traffic  for much more effective and safer operation than they could on paper.    
  
&gt;  
&gt;How I used NLP's GPT-3 to write the AI I Created  - When it comes to creating AI, there are 2 main choices I have:-  write a clean code or- just use the output from the original app to  clean code.    
  
&gt;  
&gt;Meet Microsoft's first AI-powered coffee machine - Jeff Dean, chair of Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI)  division, recently sat down with WIRED senior writer Will Knight to  discuss the value of building products that do a lot of good, but don’t  always do much of anything else.

solar,Canadian Carbon Credits for Green Energy Production,"Hey Canadians.  Since we are producing clean energy by Solar and since we are classified as microgenerators (at least in Alberta) we get federal Carbon Credits.  We own those credits and they have actual value.  I've had an offer of $1700 - $4000 over the next 10 years if I sign on with [solaroffset.ca](https://solaroffset.ca)  

Ethics to one side, are these guys legit?  They take 45% of the carbon credit as a fee.  That seems high.  Do I have any other options?

And secondly, back to ethics - IS it ethical?  I do pay carbon tax on my gasoline and my natural gas consumption.  Am I just recouping those taxes?  Or am I simply enabling big polluters?

dogecoin,Managing psychology during bear markets and applying long term strategies,"I keep seeing FUD posts about the price action with dogecoin. This is an infant asset within an infant asset class and volatility is a gift and a curse but don’t let that troll your psychology.

Mark Cuban offered advice to retail investors regarding crypto asset allocation and gave it a 1% recommendation.

When an asset is down and in a bear market the sage advice is to invest a steady rate so according to Cuban around 1% which allows you to average down in bear markets and allows for greater profits when the bull market arrives.

The reality is that the bull market run could happen at any time but I believe that it will most likely happen around the end of 2024.

Crypto investment and its link to political polarity seems strong and so when the American people are staring down the barrel of re-electing Joe Biden to a second term who has proven time and again that he will do little to nothing to put pressure on the Fed to cut out asset purchases and raise interest rates inflation will be out of control.

Think about how unfathomable our current economic situation is now compared to two years ago.

I love memes and I love dogs and I think dogecoin has a place in the legitimate digital asset space moving forward but it will take a medium term time horizon to break to all time highs.

The more people who FUD sell don’t get the lower price point that regular buyers can get over time. If we are lucky enough to see .01-.02 cent doge the price action to .10 will be 500-1000% let alone the price action to a dollar…

And it’s only a matter of time. Our current system is broken and doge will usher in the digital asset revolution

But my gut feels like this can open the door to a lot of financial products. And under the DeFi umbrella, these swaps operate entirely differently. AMM platforms claim to protect these swaps from [counter-party risk through smart contracts](https://blockworks.co/interest-rate-swaps-will-be-catalyst-for-new-era-of-defi-says-voltz-ceo/). If true, it will be the first DeFi instrument to offer interest rates without risks like impermanent loss, wild yields, and industry-wide liquidity problems.

But will this actually work? Can smart contracts account for all potential liquidity risks like over-leveraged variable rate speculation? Or do I have no clue what I'm talking about?",cryptocurrency,1654731758

A little bit after she barfed normal looking stuff, then went to poop but only the liquid red mucous came out.

Online it talks about kidney problems for the green pee and like stomach stuff from the mucous. Other things talk about what they ate making their refuse green, but I only left her alone outside unattended for like 15 minutes earlier.

The prestigious Brookings Institution placed its president, retired four-star Marine Gen. John Allen, on administrative leave amid a federal investigation into his role in an illegal lobbying campaign on behalf of the wealthy Persian Gulf nation of Qatar.

Brookings’ announcement came a day after The Associated Press reported on new court filings that show the FBI recently seized Allen’s electronic data as part of the probe and detailed his behind-the-scenes efforts to help Qatar influence U.S. policy in 2017 when a diplomatic crisis erupted between the gas-rich monarchy and its neighbors.

Allen, who led U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan before being tapped to lead Brookings in late 2017, has not been charged with any crimes. His spokesman, Beau Phillips, said Wednesday that Allen had done nothing improper or unlawful. 

Some evidence also says that   Brookings Center as a non-profit organization stop  due to corruption with Qatar

Turns out Trudeau got sick of it and ordered police to use gas and arrest everyone aaaand wait for it, blacklist crypto addresses from local exchanges associated with the bitcoin donations.

So the donation address distributed funds to other addresses to the truck drivers in the very emotional and inspirational video and now those addresses are blacklisted from all local exchanges.

Theoretically, a person can just send some/all funds to another address and avoid the blacklisting of that address?

OR, is the whole future chain of transactions are blacklisted?

CryptoCurrency,Crypto may be on the verge of a recovery sooner than you think.,"Things are not as bad as they look.

 We all know the sentiment for crypto is based on the price of BTC. The price of BTC unfortunately follows the financial markets, the financial markets use key indicators like the Dow. The Dow Jones industrial average currently does not represent the energy sector in a proper proportion with other sectors. 
(Oil and Gas companies are currently making serious bank) China is ramping up production again, Chip prices (like GPU miners) are starting to fall. High fuel costs are driving Trucking companies out of business, which is increasing the amount of used equipment onto the market, which also lowers prices, higher interest rates are deterring home buying which also lowers housing costs. 

Like any Arbitrage, things always find a way to balance themselves out. There is profitability and lowering costs happening, and the financial markets react (recover) 6 months to a year in advance of a potential recovery.

A lot of people in crypto are relatively new investors and they haven't experienced full cycles. It's these cycles that you always hear the stories about the people who ""sold too early"" and got out of BTC when it was $25.

So basically it's not a question on if Crypto recovers. It's a question of when. Just look for quality, sustainability, and revenue generation. The ""Meme Coin"" type bubble may have burst, and stay suppressed. But good projects with use case will recover and prevail.",cryptocurrency,1654780348

personalfinance,When/ should I pull the trigger on buying a car?,"So for the last year, I have been saving for a down payment on a car, working on my credit, and making sure I could afford my estimated car payment disappearing from my paycheck. I'm in a place now where I can qualify for probably a decent loan and interest rate and comfortably afford the payments. I'm a very frugal spender and still drive the 99 ford explorer my parents gave me when I graduated high school a while ago. I just replaced her tires a couple of months ago and try to do all the maintenance I can since she's basically as old as me.

The problem is that I am 100% going to move out of the country within about 3.5-4 years and I'm struggling with when I should move forward with a purchase (or if, even). Also, I got into a fender bender the other day, my first ever wreck. The other person was at fault (basically they cut me off and hit their breaks when I had the right of way). My front bumper is very bent but my car is still driveable. I will for sure use the insurance payment to get my car fixed since I will be giving the car back to my parents when the time comes. But this accident made me realize if I had a car with better breaks or something, maybe it wouldn't have happened in the first place.

I know next to nothing about how to buy a car and will have to get it financed through the dealership since a bank car loan will require that I get a car outside of my price range. My current price range is less than $10k on a 36-48 month payment plan. I'm looking at cars aged from 2013 and up, most of which have miles at 130k+. It's worth noting that I could afford more, but I don't want to. I want to prioritize other savings goals right now versus getting a newer car.

My cousin planning on selling a house giving me first dibs. My grandparents own the mortgage so I would be paying them for the house. Instead of dealing with a bank. The house would cost me 350k with a 3% interest rate. 0 down no PMI because I’m paying the mortgage to a family member. 0 down because savings took a hit with needing a new car and don’t want to use emergency fund money. 


After taxes the monthly cost would be about $2000. It’s outdated but has almost guaranteed short term renters by being close to a college campus.

Bitcoin,Something I think everyone should have a copy of to send to friends and familiy is a step by step playbook for how inflation starts and how government blames everyone but themselves. This way people can see in real time the smoke and mirrors.,"Its the same story in every country every time no matter what.

1) Interest rates are manipulated to record lows and the money printer is turned up to high to ensure the protection of the populace from evil deflation and hard times.

2) Inflation never arises and economists that were predicting inflation are ridiculed.

3) Eventually an excuse arises to print record amounts of fiat causing the central banks balance sheet to skyrocket.

4) Inflation begins to rise but is ignored and dismissed.

5) The expansion of the money supply increases aggregate demand simply because there is more money chasing the same number of goods available. 

6) This rise in demand caused by money printing is inaccurately mistaken as a fall in supply and price rises are blamed on otherwise common natural disasters and other external factors out of the control of government.

7) After the natural disasters and other excuses have ended price rises continue so they get blamed on businesses who are labelled evil price gougers.

8) Price controls are put in place to stop businesses raising their prices.

9) These price controls prevent businesses from being able to make a profit so they go out of business.

10) As price controls destroy businesses this collapses supply causing prices to start rising even faster as food shortages begin triggering protests and riots in the street.

11) Finally central banks agressively hike rates to a level above the rate of inflation to reign it in. The entire time rate rises have been the only answer to controlling inflation.

12) At this point if you are a low debt country you face a deep recession and asset market collapse but can recover eventually. If you are a high debt country the rise in interest rates pushes government debt into a sovereign debt crisis and you enter the realm of Zimbabwe Argentina and Turkey with a deep recession and hyperinflation simultaneously.

I feel like there should be an easy to understand visual representation of this process so people can see in real time the lies that the government will inevitably spout to push the blame for inflation from themselves onto everyone and everything else.

The reason raising rates and reducing government spending is the answer to reigning in inflation is becuase lowering rates and increasing government spending is what caused it in the first place. Or as the famous Milton Friedman says ""Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"".

And the final step of course is no matter the outcome, recession or hyperinflation, saving your wealth in bitcoin is the answer to protect yourself and family.",cryptocurrency,1654784813

I'm less scared of losing money than I am of the feeling that I bought at a bad time, and I'm convinced better prices are coming in the next 6-12 months.

I've been in the market for a while and I've seen the V shape recoveries, but every single time it was because the Fed came in to support. I don't think that will happen any time soon, so why not pull out and buy back in DCA style 10-30% lower? Or literally wait until the Fed uturns then go back in all at once?

If you try this from another IP address (perhaps you have a new internet service provider), even more trouble.

2. Holding USDC for any length of time - why? - These are post TerraUST 19% APR times, but Circle (USDT) just seems too centralised. 

3. if you MUST hold USDC, please hold it on a DEX, ffs !

4. Not Your Keys, Not Your, Coin.

5. Bastard Practices - Coinbase probably skimming off some profit on your USDC holdings, and chucking you .015% peanuts. Then they gonna rob you again with their exchange fees.

6. Holding an a centralised exchange, you're just helping to centralise the crypto industry - the very ethos of the distributed ledger revolution, no?. Good idea, no?

7. = USDC is not gonna go to any Moon. Yup, It's a stable coin. like, zero capital growth.

8. Just fuckin' buy gold - that'll appreciate faster.

9 - If you're going to stake USDC for such pittance, stick it into traditional stocks and shares?  Even Apple Inc, one of the safest, largest companies out there gives 0.60%

personalfinance,Paying for Kids' College,"Background:  I'm an early 50s divorced Washington state male with twin boys that will both be off to university in late summer.  I have about $1.8 million equity in my home and approximately $170k in my Schwab brokerage account and $20k in cash.  I will almost certainly have to sell and downsize my house some day to be able to retire, but for reasons too broad to list here that is not currently an option.  I make about $100k annually as sole owner of my service LLC.

Both of my boys will be maxing out their $5,500 annual federal student loan and will both be receiving financial aid and scholarships, but there is still a significant gap remaining that will need to be funded.  Their mom and I have agreed to fund this gap out of our deep love for them, and it looks like I'm going to be on the hook for approximately $80k total over the course of four years.

I'm trying to determine whether I use IRA funds in my Schwab account to pay for this, as I understand that there are no penalties if the IRA is used to pay for higher education, or if I should instead take a Parent Plus or personal loan (whether it be a line of credit or HELOC).  I'm wondering if it would make sense to speak with a CPA or financial advisor about this decision, but was hoping to receive some initial guidance here before proceeding.",finance,1654799564

personalfinance,Sel Want to move to HCOL but not sure if I should rent or sell or if I’m crazy for doing this.,"I (34F) own a 3 bed/2.5 bath luxury townhome in a suburb which is 5 years old. I’ve owned since it was built and purchased for $324,000. Recently I’ve felt like moving to a city since it’s becoming tougher to live a suburban lifestyle as a single woman in a community designed for families and I feel a change in lifestyle would be best for me.

My home like most has increased in value and could sell for $550,000+ and I owe $284,000 giving me quite a bit of equity around 200k + after realtor fees etc. I’m planning to move about 5 hours away and pay $3k in rent while my mortgage is $1680/month. I’ve spoken with a property manager who would list it for rent at $2250. After paying mortgage + higher insurance + HOA + propert mgmt fee, I’m probably only banking around &amp;50-$100 extra a month.

My financial advisor says to sell but my gut is telling me to hold on to property as I feel it could get more difficult to own in the future with higher interest rates. I feel like I couldn’t buy this nice of a property at this price and I’m concerned if I let it go I will regret it. I also am not sure I will stay in a city with such a high HCOL and feel like renting it out would be a safety net I could return to if things don’t pan out in my new city.

On the other hand I could invest that $200k and hope the markets do well enough that I could have a larger down payment in a couple years time and be just fine if not better off.

stocks,Here's What States Will Have to Agree to If They Want Federal EV Charging Money,"For states to receive funding for public charging stations as part of the **$5 billion allotted in last year’s infrastructure bill**, they’ll have to agree to meet minimum operational standards. The Biden administration confirmed those standards will be released next week, per Automotive News:

The standards will help ensure that a national EV charging network is accessible, user-friendly and interoperable between different charging companies and across a broad range of vehicles, White House and administration officials said.

“These new standards will make sure that these chargers can be used by everyone — no matter what car you drive, where you live or how you pay,” Mitch Landrieu, the White House’s infrastructure implementation coordinator, said during a press call.

And here’s a little teaser, in the form of a broad summation, of what those standards will include:

**The proposed rule includes a requirement to build EV charging stations every 50 miles, no more than 1 mile off the highway, and with a focus on the interstate system and alternative fuel corridors. Stations also would be required to have at least four 150-kilowatt direct-current fast-charging ports capable of simultaneously charging four EVs.**

**It also requires real-time information on station location, availability and pricing, and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other relevant state and federal requirements, officials said.**

**The EV charging infrastructure also would be required to operate on the same software platforms across states, and there would be data submittal requirements to create a public EV charging database as well as network connectivity requirements to enable secure remote monitoring, diagnostics, control and updates.**

**More specifically, it would require that chargers communicate with EVs through an industry-standard charging port type called the Combined Charging System, which would accommodate a baseline of vehicles as well as the use of EV charging adapters.**

**States will need to submit their plans to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, a new department established specifically for this purpose, by August 1 for approval by September 30. Only after that process can they receive funding.**

Automotive News also reports that alongside this new public charging infrastructure, the White House has formed an **EV Working Group, made up of 25 members to be selected that will “make recommendations on the development, adoption and integration of EVs across the U.S.”** What requirements have been shared above seem reasonable at first glance, especially the stipulation they must run on the same software. Foresight: you love to see it.

Generally speaking, there is a very apparent roadblock to mainstreaming Bitcoin and that is, of course, education. The uncertainty of what it is and what it does is the largest barrier to entry. If the general population was educated about Bitcoin through a casual viewing platform, Netflix, it would be the most effective way to educate everyday people to make their own decision with their money and unveil the mysterious world of Bitcoin. This would have the broadest reach for those who have not made the leap to do their own research yet.

Topics to discuss:

* What is money?
* What is the history of money and what value does it bring to the human race?
* What are the pros and cons of a gold standard?
* What is a fiat currency?
* Why does inflation occur?
* How does an inflationary currency cause harm to people?
* What is Bitcoin?
* How does Bitcoin work?
* Why is Bitcoin secure?
* What does Bitcoin allow us to do?

Personally I'm on the fence as I believe there need to be *some* nationwide laws and norms, but then I look at the massive concentration of power at the federal level and think maybe there is a better way.

So I'd like to hear your takes on both how blockchain technology can be used in government to increase transparency, how far we can realistically take that without jeopardizing national security, and whether decentralization and distribution of power and control back to state and local governments would improve peoples citizens lives. 

I'm of the mind both are good ideas up to a point, after which it becomes dangerous to national security if things like defense/black ops budgets are put on the chain, and too divisive if certain important nationwide laws and norms aren't recognized by all states. But to me much of the power at the federal level should be redistributed back to the states.

personalfinance,Good idea or bad? Anything I’m missing?,"Hello,

Last weekend my wife and I put in an offer in on a home and it was accepted.  This is a builder home, so it was built by the guy who owns his own construction business for his own personal use.  The attention to detail in this home is stunning. The home inspector stated he didn’t cut corners and home has things most don’t, but I suppose it came at a cost…

The builder didn’t finish the basement. There was clearly a plan to do it like it has the framing up, things in place for a bathroom, etc. now for the finance question…

We are selling our current home and didn’t include a home sale contingency to make the offer cleaner.  This meant that we were only able to put down 10%.  Once we sell our house, this frees up our equity. I was thinking of the following ideas of what to do with the money:

1.	Hold cash in interesting bearing account, which will pretty much break me even on the PMI. Use the money to refinance the mortgage when rates dip again, if it ever does.
2.	I could use the money to finish the basement, get the house reappraised to value it enough to get the PMI to drop off. 
3.	I was thinking of setting aside money for my student loans, at least an amount for the loans that have a higher interest rate than my mortgage and pay it off once student payments resume.  Then use the rest for finishing up maybe?

I feel like #1 is the smart thing to do but it is also somewhat of a gamble at least a riskier one in comparison to the others.

2, doesn’t really seem to do much other than drop PMI. However, there is a need for the basement to be finished because we will need the extra bedroom at some point within the next year or two.

3, is really just about tackling my highest rate loan commitments first and working my way down.

Are there any benefits to one over another like maybe some type of tax credit? I was thinking maybe finishing the basement might have something or whatever. Am I missing something that I haven’t thought of?

investing,Crocs Inc. (CROX) Analysis,"Whats up, this is my second analysis. I would like your feedback on my method and some additions to what I might have missed.

## Business / Developments

Crocs main business is related to it’s famous clogs, while it tries to expand it’s brand in the sandals market. Additionally it makes money from the personalization options via Jibbitz, which according to the company achieves higher engagement and buying frequency for the products family as a whole supported by strong licenses like Disney brands.

**Growth**

To increase growth Crocs focuses on:

* increasing digital sales
* expanding in the sandals market
* growth in Asia

**Growth in Asia**

2/3 of all store openings were made in Asia with most of them in China. Over a quarter of all stores are based in Korea which is suprising at first and indicates a strong presence of the brand. Still most revenue growth was achieved in the Americas and EMEA, which doesn’t fit the companies aim to drive growth with Asia.

## HEYDUDE Acquisition

In it’s most recent quarterly report Crocs explained the acquisition of the HEYDUDE shoe brand on Febuary 17 2022. With a purchase price of $2.3 billion and additional expenses, it is Crocs first relevant acquisition and has been financed with $450 million in stock and over $2 billion in borrowings. The borrowing compromises mostly of an entry in the Term Loan B Facility with an interest rate equal to the SOFR plus additional 3.5% resulting in around 4% at the moment. With $115 million in revenue and $16 million this **quarter** the acquisition has a P/S of over 5 and a P/E of 39, which doesn’t really make it a bargain. Crocs stated it sees potential for HEYDUDE to reach 1 billion dollars in sales by 2024, which was the main reason for it’s purchase. With HEYDUDE already achieving high profits in it’s growth phase, large increases in it’s revenue would have a large impact on Crocs bottom line. We still have to take those estimates with a grain of salt, as almost no information is available. They state a guidance for around $800 million dollars for this year alone, which we will use in one of our DCF models.

|Asia Pacific|348,072|278,515 |350,160|
|EMEA|241,948|243,660|356,157|

Table 1: Segment Revenues

Even though Crocs tries to focus it’s expansion efforts on Asia, the large part of it’s existing revenue

and growth came from the Americas (mostly USA).

||2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|1,036,273|1,023,513|1,088,205|1,230,593 |1,385,951|2,313,416|

|Gross profit Margin|48,3%|50,5%|51,5%|50,2%|54,1%|61,4%|
|Operating Profit Margin|Loss|Loss|5,8%|10,5%|15,4%|29,5%|

Table 2: Sales and Profitablility

Looking at this table it almost speaks for itself. Crocs has increased it’s prices by 25% and has experienced a suprising large increase in units sold. It’s operating margin has developed from a loss to almost 30%. Most of it can be attributed to a recent hype for Crocs shoes with lots of attention coming from the hypebeast community. We will search for more answers on the development of the operating margin, by looking at the cost structure.

## Cost Structure (before HEYDUDE acquisition)

||2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cost of sales|51,7%|49,5%|48,5%|49,9%|45,9%|38,6%|
|SGA|48,6%|48,3%|45,5%|39,7%|37,1%|31,9%|
|Operating Margin|\-0,6%|1,7%|5,8%|10,5%|15,4%|29,5%|

Table 3: Costs as a percentage of revenue

Over the years Crocs SGA expenses have hovered around the $500 million mark, while it decreased relative to revenues, when revenues finally picked up pace in 2019. The cost of sales always trailed revenue, but as the average price per unit increased by 12% from 2019-2020 the realtive cost of sales decreased by 8%. Similar developments occured, when Crocs raised it’s average price per unit by another 12% the cost of sales portion shrunk by another 15%. This development and it’s significant increase in pure unit sales allowed Crocs to develop from barely profitable into a cash-cow.

## Industry Comparison

|Company|Operating Margin|Cost of sales|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nike|15%|55%|
|Deckers|20%|46%|
|Sketchers|9,5%|51%|
|Adidas|9,4%|49,3%|

Their unique product gives Crocs a competitive advantage, which has finally shown in 2020 and 2021. They top most big player in the footwear business in terms of operating margin as they were able to raise their prices significantly, which the highly competitive “normal” manufacturers weren’t able to do.

## Balance Sheet

With the Acquisition of HEYDUDE, Crocs balance sheet has doubled in size.

The most relevant changes of the last quarter included:

* Assets
   * Addition of $640 million in Goodwill
   * Addition of $1,88 billion in Intangibles
   * Doubling in inventory size ($213 million → $407 million), which isn’t concerning as most of the increase was due to the acquisition
* Liabilities
   * Addition of $2 billion in Long-term borrowings
   * Addition of $329 million in Long-term deferred tax liabilities

## Treasury Stock

Crocs has bought back 47,7 million shares which lie in the books at a value of around $1,7 billion dollars, which gives them an average cost basis of around $35 per share. This gives them very nice protection against a hostile takeover and the ability to raise good amounts of cash if needed.

## Debt Level

At a debt level of $2,8 billion Crocs interest expense amounts for $20 million per quarter. Looking at their Income, it’s safe to say that it won’t have much trouble with it’s debt. The management also announced in the investor presentation that one of it’s financial efforts will be a quick deleveraging.

## Cashflow Statement

## Share based compensation

Share based compensation has amounted for $8,2 million dollar or around 10% of net income in the first quarter. On an annual basis this amounts for around 1% of the total market cap at the price. This isn’t alarming in my opinion.

## CapEx and Depreciation&amp;Amortization

|As a percentage of revenue|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|D&amp;A|3,3%|3,2%|2,7%|2,0%|2,0%|1,4%|
|CapEx|1,2%|1,3%|2,0%|3,0%|3,0%|2,4%|

CapEx hovered between 1-3% of revenue, which is good news for a manufacturing company. They increased their CapEx fivefold, which indicated new investments to meet higher demand for their products. The HEYDUDE acquisition won’t increase amortization as most of the purchased intangible assets consist of trademarks and workforce, which can’t be tax deducted.

## Share Buybacks

Share buybacks have been excessive in the past year, even though they have been made at a high price per share of $120 which is not appealing at all, but was due too the sky high prices of up to $180 in November. In the future further share repurchases are paused until the deleveraging has reached it’s target, which as stated in the report won’t happen in 2022.

## Other

## Insider Trading / Ownership

Since the share price dropped under $90 there has been some small and big purchases by the upper management. During the skyrocketing, there have been significant sales as the price began to climb above $50. We will keep that in mind for later.

## Analyst coverage / Institutional Ownership

There are 11 analysts (5) covering the stock (for comparision Amazon: 38), which is quite high and a negative. The institutional ownership is also high with 80% (4). Not a sign that a company is under the radar.

## Risks

* Decreasing hype for their product
* Flop of HEYDUDE acquisition
* Price decreases destroying their operating margin
* No real market evaluation possible as Crocs is a unique product → no certainty the market will grow
* Competitiors meeting their quality standards, thus stealing market share
* Not gaining a foothold in China
* Not gaining a foothold in the sandal industry

## DCF

Summary of the Assumptions made:

* By the managements guidance from investor presentation (3)
   * $750-$800 million dollars in revenue for HEYDUDE in 2022
   * Operating margin of 26%+ long term for Crocs (2026Estimate) and 26%+ for HEYDUDE in 2024E
   * Crocs revenue growth of 17% / HEYDUDE 20%+
   * CapEx: 3% of revenue
* Our assumptions
   * SGA Expenses and cost of sales have increases sharply. We will still take the resulting 18% operating margin at face value for our base case (15% bear case, 20% best case)

||Bear Case|Best Case|Best Case|Management Guidance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue Growth Crocs (4% after 2026)|10%|13%|15%|17%+|

personalfinance,Having a hard time comparing Home Equity Loan Options - Cash Out Refinance that Doubles my Current Interest Rate vs. HELOC at a Higher Interest Rate,"Hi everyone,

The math classes I took at art school are failing to help me compare to ""Home Equity Loans"" I'm looking into. My house is currently worth upwards of $320,000 and I only owe about $122,000. So I'd like to take out about $35,000 for some home improvements.

Here are the terms of my current mortgage:

* Owe: $122,000
* Rate: 2.75%
* Final Payment: 12/2046

My current mortgage provider is offering to do a ""Cash Out Refinance"" on the following terms:

* Owe: $157,000 (the original $122,000 + $35,000)
* Rate: 5.75%
* Final Payment: 08/2052 

I also have offers for Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit around the following terms:

* Loan: $35,000
* Rate: 12%
* Final Payment: 08/2052 

So, while the interest rate is dramatically lower on the ""cash out refinance"", I'm worried that the jump from 2.75% to 5.75% for the ENTIRE mortgage will hurt me in the long run.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1654849058

76. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss.

87. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
88. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network.

101. Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill.

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.0 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.3 percent in April, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.6 percent before seasonal adjustment.

The increase was broad-based, with the indexes for shelter, gasoline, and food being the largest contributors. After declining in April, the energy index rose 3.9 percent over the month with the gasoline index rising 4.1 percent and the other major component indexes also increasing. The food index rose 1.2 percent in May as the food at home index increased 1.4 percent.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in May, the same increase as in April. While almost all major components increased over the month, the largest contributors were the indexes for shelter, airline fares, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles. The indexes for medical care, household furnishings and operations, recreation, and apparel also increased in May.

**The all items index increased 8.6 percent for the 12 months ending May, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981**. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.0 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index rose 34.6 percent over the last year, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending September 2005. The food index increased 10.1 percent for the 12-months ending May, the first increase of 10 percent or more since the period ending March 1981.

Annual inflation rate in the US unexpectedly accelerated to 8.6% in May of 2022, the highest since December of 1981 and compared to market forecasts of 8.3%. Energy prices rose 34.6%, the most since September of 2005, due to gasoline (48.7%), fuel oil (106.7%, the largest increase on record), electricity (12%, the largest 12-month increase since August 2006), and natural gas (30.2%, the most since July 2008). Food costs surged 10.1%, the first increase of 10% or more since March 1981. Big increases were seen in prices of meats, poultry, fish, and eggs (14.2%). Other increases were also seen in cost of shelter (5.5%, the most since February 1991), household furnishings and operations (8.9%), used cars and trucks (16.1%) and airline fares (37.8%) while cost of new vehicles eased slightly (12.6% vs 13.2%). Meanwhile, core inflation rate slowed for a second month to 6%, compared to expectations of 5.9%.

Inflation accelerated further in May, with prices rising 8.6% from a  year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981, the Bureau of  Labor Statistics reported Friday.

The consumer price index, a  wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more  than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding volatile food and energy  prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9%  estimate.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared to respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.

Surging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.

Energy  prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to  34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain,  pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.

Shelter costs, which account  for about a one-third weighting on the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month,  the fastest one-month gain since March 2004. The 5.5% 12-month gain is  the most since February 1991.

Finally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.

Those  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month.  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though  average hourly earnings rose 0.3%. On a 12-month basis, real average  hourly earnings were down 3%.

Markets reacted negatively to the  report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall  Street and government bond yields rising.

Some of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%).

Friday’s numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.

The  inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a  rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May’s report  likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest  rate increases ahead.

“Obviously, nothing is good in this report,”  said Julian Bridgen, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic  research firm. “There is nothing in there that’s going to give the Fed  any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.”

With  75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets  widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and  possibly into 2023. The central bank’s benchmark short-term borrowing  rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to  2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.

Inflation has been a political headache for the White House and President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).

Administration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to [the Covid pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/), imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services, and [the Russian attack on Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).

In  a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further  improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the  budget deficit.

However, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering  inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that  the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.

How  much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper  with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go  further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current  inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears  because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now.",finance,1654864671

personalfinance,Financial Planner - Justifiable or Throwing Away Money?,"My spouse and I earn about $650k in a VHCOL city. We have about $200k in savings between retirement and investment accounts and somewhat more than in debt that as a mix of federal and refinanced private student loans. We have both had substantial increases in our salary and are trying to balance our existing substantial student loan debt burden, investing responsibly, enjoying ourselves on a shorter timeframe, and planning for big ticket items like buying a home, children, and retirement. 

The two of us have pretty different mindsets about our finances and budgeting though we ultimately share similar goals. With that said, even though we are comfortable with our income, our interest in remaining in this VHCOL area means that we have still unfortunately had a lot of friction over finances. 

My question is around getting a CFP to provide advice around things like cash flow and the where to place our excess income. Is it justifiable at let's say $3600 annually to hire someone? It feels like we'd be throwing money away, but at the same time, between peace of mind and potentially better strategic decision-making, is this something I should feel comfortable with?",finance,1654869241

Interest rates are so low for savings accounts that I've never made more than a few dollars in a single year off them lol. 

I view stablecoins as the same thing, basically -- I'm parking money on a coin that is tied to the US dollar and offers high interest yields, not unlike a savings account would. But when it comes time to ""cash out,"" my question is, how are those interest gains accounted for?

Example: let's say I have $500 in Gemini Dollar and I park it there for a year and earn $30 worth of Gemini Dollar. Now I have $530. And I decide to cash it out for whatever reason, and take all my money... how do I account for the extra $30 on my taxes? Is that considered a ""gain""? Do I have to report anything for the initial $500 investment?

I am constantly checking Mint to see if I am going to go over my budget, what my net worth is, how my investments are doing, and where I can spend less money.

I know I make a decent amount for my age but it genuinely feels like I don't have enough money to do the things I want and live stress-free when it comes to spending money. It doesn't help that I have a friend that always wants to go out to eat at restaurants and I feel like a stingy asshole if I say ""no"" because he knows how much money I make.

The remaining balance on my remodel contract is about $60,000 to be paid in installments as certain milestones are met. With interest rates rising my thought is that I should draw the additional $50,000 and convert the total balance to a fixed rate option rather than making draws as the payments to the contractor actually come due. Am I looking at this the right way or is there anything I should consider?

Edit: The fixed rate option for 5, 10, and 15 year is 6.75% and 20 year is 6.80%. Just worried that by the time we’re done drawing the fixed rates will be even higher.

economy,Addressing Scary CPI Headlines,"As you all know the May CPI report came back at 8.6% however, I wanted to help calm some nerves by providing context for people who might not fully understand what that number means.

That 8.6% is Year-over-Year meaning we’ve seen the price of goods rise 8.6% since May 2021. I’ve seen multiple scary headlines that make it seem like the price of goods has risen 8.6% since April and that’s just misleading. Ultimately prices have risen ~1% since last month, which, don’t get me wrong, is still a lot for one month, but it’s not AS bad as the media wants you to believe. (Fear sells)

Finally, while inflation is still increasing and thusly, hasn’t peaked yet, we did see the rate of inflation slow down between this report and Aprils report which is good! It means the FEDs tightening policy is working and trust me it’s much better to take this stuff slowly than to over tighten and cause a brutal recession.

Just wanted to put that out there, I know a lot of people on this sub hate the FED but they’re at least doing something to help and sooner rather than later we’ll get through this period of uncertainty.

solar,"Getting solar as new home owner with sub-optimal cash flow in California? (for future, not needed right now, time for tax cuts is ticking...)","* I am new home owner in the SF Bay Area (2500sqft)
* I am very energy conscious. At beginning, expect low usage.
   * In my previous 2B1.5BR apartment, energy bill was 30$-50$.
   * In the new home, I expect it to be 60-80$ for the beginning (&lt;**200kWh/month**).
   * Right now, we are just two people, dishwasher runs 1-2/week, laundry 3-4x/month, lights only when used, no AC, no other big appliances
* Water heating, heating (hopefully we won't use it; SF-Bay) and stove is gas.

&amp;#x200B;

* In the mid/long term, I could see my energy consumption to increase as follows (order of time):
   * I would love to run my own private data center rack and not care about costs. Assuming a decent 130W, this would add 100kWh/month.
   * I have a cottage which I plan to rent out
   * Our family grows
   * My vision is to get an electric car once I have more money (5+ years) and use that for powering the car. Never caring about gas prices any more!
   * *EDIT:* When I have more money, I'd also like to get a sauna and/or hot tub
   * Eventually (10+ years?) getting rid of dirty, expensive gas and replace appliances (however, right now they are in good condition, nice Viking range, new water heaters)

&amp;#x200B;

* I love the idea of being self-sustaining and not needing to care about energy price increases. I even more love the idea of powering my car with it!
* I love the idea of a battery backup, being resilient against outages
   * Especially w.r.t. my private ""data center""
   * However, battery cost seems 150% than solar itself, so I might not get this at the beginning

&amp;#x200B;

* Strictly speaking, as you can see above, I don't need solar right now (low usage). Long term I definitely see this growing but I never see myself as huge energy spender/waster (energy conscious upbringing). Yet, I still love the idea of being my own energy provider

&amp;#x200B;

* I am feeling time pressed. Incentives are getting less and less and next year, more will be gone:
   * 26% federal tax credit phases out this year
   * NEM 2.0 phases out for very unfavorable NEM 3.0 some time this year

&amp;#x200B;

* With EnergySage I got quotes for \~3.5kW systems (8 panels) at 7000$ net investment
   * Battery an additional 12000$ net investment which hurts badly
   * Electric installation and panel is older and certainly needs upgrade. Not sure how much this adds
   * Roof is 21 years old. Not sure re-roofing is required/highly recommended but inspection said it's in reasonable condition without requiring immediate attention. Re-roofing would add another 10-20k

&amp;#x200B;

* Financing:
   * I *could* pay upfront for solar by liquidating savings but I prefer not.
   * Nearly entire amount of current income goes into PITI and other expenses (sub optimal cash flow)
   * There are a couple of other maintenance projects which are more urgent than solar
   * I am thinking of loan financing with a monthly payment on the order of my electricity bill
      * Preferably a specialized loan
      * I also have huge equity in the home so home equity loan or HELOC might be an option if it's meaningful

&amp;#x200B;

With these in mind, what are your thoughts? Shall I just forget about getting solar?

Or shall I still do it, even though there is no immediate need? Especially to lock in NEM 2.0 and tax breaks?

Is loan financing a solar project meaningful?

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming no re-roofing required and just panel upgrade, I'd round up the 7000$ solar estimate to $10000. Is this reasonable?

How important is the battery? As much as I would like it but the huge 12k price makes me very hesitant of getting it right now. Is it reasonable to believe that battery costs drop in the future, offsetting the loss of tax breaks/benefits?",energy,1654885806
stocks,"DocuSign Earnings Spook Investors, Consumer Prices Unexpectedly Rise; Stocks Fall as Lows Outpace Highs","During trading Friday, 1 stock traded to a 52-week high, while 154 stocks bottomed out at new 52-week lows. The S&amp;P 500 is down 2.29% so far today while the Dow is down 2.06%, the Nasdaq is down 2.94%, and the Russell 2000 is down 2.88%.

Stocks are lower this afternoon following an unexpected uptick in consumer prices. 

The Consumer Price Index rose 1.0% in May against estimates set at a 0.7% rise. This brought the yearly rise to a 40-year high. The report challenged the peak inflation narrative as prices rose in nearly every category and mean that the Fed is forced to maintain its aggressive rate-hike path to tackle inflation.

Meanwhile, the preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment eroded more than expected in June to a reading of 50.2, compared to estimates for a rise to a reading of 59.0. This is the lowest reading ever for the index, dating back to 1978 as Consumer Expectations fall amidst persistent inflation.

Docusign Inc (DOCU) is declining 23.84% after the company missed earnings and reaffirmed full-year 2023 revenue guidance while providing in line guidance for the second quarter.

There were some notable and worrisome comments and actions in the earnings report. DocuSign slashed its full-year billing guidance amidst many headwinds, including inflationary and workforce woes. Further, the war in Ukraine is dampening its demand in Europe, one of DocuSign's largest markets for expansion. Lastly, the company doubled its size during the pandemic and has struggled to find a way to maintain growth, with the company noting that the strong COVID tailwind has turned into a headwind.

stocks,Microsoft to cut television advertising campaigns to save money as concerns grow that consumer spending is weakening.,"Business Insider cited three unnamed sources at the company as saying that it paused its TV advertising. That follows a report by Variety saying that Microsoft will sit out TV upfronts, the opportunity to buy network inventory in advance. When reached for comment, Microsoft said in an emailed statement to Barron’s that it had “nothing additional to share here.”

One person with direct knowledge said the company made the advertising cuts in the face of rising interest rates and supply chain challenges to avoid layoffs, according to the Business Insider report. The company allegedly told media buyers and TV networks that it would not participate in the TV upfronts, which is a period of time where television networks and advertisers negotiate marketing and ad deals, according to Variety. Microsoft spent an estimated $294.8 million on TV advertising in 2021. Other global advertisements for Microsoft companies like Xbox will still be handled by marketing company IPG ’s McCann Worldgroup, according to sources cited by Business Insider.

Microsoft is one of the latest tech giants to slow down hiring in 2022 due to economic uncertainty. The hiring slow down will specifically affect the Windows, Office, and Teams chat and conferencing software groups, according to a Bloomberg report. The company also reduced its financial forecasts for the June quarter earlier this month.

Bitcoin,"Inflation always reminds me of one of Henry Ford's most famous quotes: ""'It is perhaps well enough that the people of the nation do not know or understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning'""","Our modern day financial system is essentially a giant ponzi scheme and pyramid scheme with extra steps, it's the extra steps that make it be too confusing for the laymen to understand what's happening, allowing the system to continue instead of having it get overturned and reinvented: [https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-modern-financial-system-is-a-debt-based-pyramid-scheme-and-an-investment-based-ponzi-scheme-e37c4154b9](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-modern-financial-system-is-a-debt-based-pyramid-scheme-and-an-investment-based-ponzi-scheme-e37c4154b9)

A more academic version of the article on the Nasdaq with links to sources, instead of like the previous link that more so tries to use imagery to better relay the message: [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-fixes-the-modern-fiat-ponzi-scheme-2021-09-14](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-fixes-the-modern-fiat-ponzi-scheme-2021-09-14)

It's sad that people don't see this yet, but Bitcoin has started a fascinating trend that leads people down a rabbit whole of financial education that allows them to see this fiat Ponzi and Securities Pyramid scheme for the scans they are.

We only have a few hundred million people today in this space, and I'd say only a few tens of millions have been in it long enough learning about it, to better comprehend the giant scam with extra steps that is the traditional financial system.

What happens in 4 years when we're projecting over a billion users, and likely by then a few hundred million users who've learned enough about the financial system to understand the scam that it is? Will we get the revolution over night that Henry Ford prophesized?

If not then, then what happens in 10 years when we project 5+ billion users with a few billions having learned enough to better understand the Fiat Ponzi and Securities Pyramid scams with extra steps?

If you're a long time hodler then you already know what happens. Eventually your banks fails you as they do everyone all the time, and Bitcoin offers you a work around. After that, things become much clearer seeing how Bitcoin can do for you everything your bank does for you without all the inefficiency's.

Even getting loans against your Bitcoin is an easier process with better rates than a banking loan, and anyone who's been in long enough to start doing that has learned enough to only ever do it with the smallest portion of their holdings to not be at risk of not having more Bitcoin in reserves to cover a margin call.

**F.A. Hayek** once said:  [""I don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can't take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can't stop.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uo-KfnkhI)

So tell me, what happens in 20 years when 7+ billions of people are projected to be using Bitcoin like people have grown to use email today, and even more billions having learned enough from their curiosity in it to see the old financial system for the giant convoluted scam that it is?

Bitcoin's adoption rate has held strong for 13 years, and for those thirteen years it has grown at twice the speed of the first internet.

If you study what happens to adoptees after they start studying Bitcoin and the financial system, to better understand why Bitcoin goes up in value over time like it does,  then you know the usual result is we Hodlers start denominating everything in Bitcoin, saving in Bitcoin. And dollars and other fiat currencies? Well we keep as few those as we need. Hell the oldest of us in this space don't keep any dollars anymore. We have credit and debit cards that we can pay with our Bitcoin so we never have to touch that fiat shit again.

CryptoCurrency,"Inflation always reminds me of one of Henry Ford's most famous quotes: ""'It is perhaps well enough that the people of the nation do not know or understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning'""","Our modern day financial system is essentially a giant ponzi scheme and pyramid scheme with extra steps, it's the extra steps that make it be too confusing for the laymen to understand what's happening, allowing the system to continue instead of having it get overturned and reinvented: [https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-modern-financial-system-is-a-debt-based-pyramid-scheme-and-an-investment-based-ponzi-scheme-e37c4154b9](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-modern-financial-system-is-a-debt-based-pyramid-scheme-and-an-investment-based-ponzi-scheme-e37c4154b9)

It's sad that people don't see this yet, but Bitcoin has started a fascinating trend that leads people down a rabbit whole of financial education that allows them to see this fiat Ponzi and Securities Pyramid scheme for the scans they are.

We only have a few hundred million people today in this space, and I'd say only a few tens of millions have been in it long enough learning about it, to better comprehend the giant scam with extra steps that is the traditional financial system.

What happens in 4 years when we're projecting over a billion users, and likely by then a few hundred million users who've learned enough about the financial system to understand the scam that it is? Will we get the revolution over night that Henry Ford prophesized?

If not then, then what happens in 10 years when we project 5+ billion users with a few billions having learned enough to better understand the Fiat Ponzi and Securities Pyramid scams with extra steps?

If you're a long time hodler then you already know what happens. Eventually your banks fails you as they do everyone all the time, and Bitcoin offers you a work around. After that, things become much clearer seeing how Bitcoin can do for you everything your bank does for you without all the inefficiency's.

Even getting loans against your Bitcoin is an easier process with better rates than a banking loan, and anyone who's been in long enough to start doing that has learned enough to only ever do it with the smallest portion of their holdings to not be at risk of not having more Bitcoin in reserves to cover a margin call.

**F.A. Hayek** once said:  [""I don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can't take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can't stop.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uo-KfnkhI)

some background -- my father passed last year and shortly after his mother/my grandmother passed as well. as a result, i received around $60k cash from the sum of bank assets, life insurance, the sale of our grandmother's house etc. 

this influx of cash is a really strange feeling and idk how to wrap my head around it. i grew up lower middle class and have always had a bit of a scarcity mindset which has caused me to be either too anxious or too careless when it comes to personal finances. i am resisting every urge in my soul to go totally bonkers with this money.

i'm 24 years old, live in los angeles, make $65k/year, i have $5k federal student debt (low interest), and have about $2k in a roth IRA i set up a couple years ago. i got myself in a decent financial place prior to this inheritance, but i haven't been diligent about investing for my future.

based on other threads i've seen, i know people will likely recommend paying off debt and putting money into the roth IRA. but how much should i put in the roth? how much should i keep in the bank? what kind of investments do you recommend for this sum of money?? what can i do to set myself up for success in the long term? how do i even become versed in all things personal finance?? how do i get rid of the impulse to buy things???

this is the only inheritance i'll get for the rest of my life, and i'm way too young and stupid to be handling this now, so i appreciate any wisdom from y'all 🙏",finance,1654898407

stocks,Fed tightening will need to be far greater than current projections - Research paper,"Very interesting paper from Larry Summers and a couple other economists I'm not familiar with.

Basically it argues that current inflation is nearly as bad as the late 70s and 80s. And that inflation is not nearly as responsive to Fed policy as many optimists believe. The takeaway being that Fed policy will need to approach Volker Fed levels of restrictive, far in excess of the 3-3.5% rates that the Fed currently projects.

You've probably heard people say that if we measured inflation now the same way we did in before 1983, inflation would be more like 15% rather than 8.5%. That's true. Inflation now is about as bad as the early 80s. This paper attempts to create comparable metrics for various inflationary periods in US history. It also demonstrates that inflation is not as responsive to Fed rate hikes as some would believe, by showing how the pre-Volker CPI was artificially high and artificially came down more than it would if we measured it as we do today in response to Fed policy.

All suggesting that the Fed is still wildly behind the curve and much more restrictive policy will be required to tame inflation. Perhaps as restrictive as the Volker Fed, which sent the US into a severe recession. Strongly encourage everyone to give this a read. Worth noting that Summers has been correct so far in this inflation cycle and the optimists all have egg on their face.

As for the impact on stocks if Summers is correct - Bad, very bad.

I also have the very real possibility of getting into the $80,000 range next year.  I don’t pay rent per say, but I do pay my parents around $500/month to cover some bills, groceries, etc.  

I currently have $62,000 in student loans.  That’s split between $23,500 across several federal loans, and the rest is a private loan through my bank.  I also had a $9,000 car loan at the beginning of the year, but I paid that off at the end of April.  I also have $5,000 in savings.  

I’ve been able to put around $3,000/month towards my debts so far.  At this rate I should be debt free by the end of 2023.  I plan to spend the first couple months of 2024 getting my emergency fund up to $15,000, and then using the rest of the year to save for a down payment on a house.  My max hosing budget is $250,000, and that’s before the down payment, so my mortgage would be around $200,000.  I also plan on buying some land in a neighboring state for a hunting camp and timber property.  My max budget for that is $100,000, but I could always buy cheaper. 

Does anything jump out as too overzealous with this plan?  Should I lower my budgeted prices?

personalfinance,Should I take the personal loan of 3k?,"Hello, I recently attempted to get a personal loan to consolidate debt. However, the underwriters counter offered for much less than I needed. I am unsure whether to take the loan or if it would just add to my constant financial downhill. 

Details: 

-I am about 7-8k in credit card debt with 4 cards. 

-edit: I owe a private party 4.5k for my current living situation 

-I am in desperate need of tires ($500-800) for our only vehicle. 

-We did not qualify for a personal loan with our credit union because our income was too low. 

-The counteroffer was only 3k at a low interest rate and $93/month. This offer only covers ONE of my cards (and also the only one with an extreme interest rate). 

I am unsure because:

-we just applied, we got an inquiry on our credit score. I’m afraid to keep shopping and take more hits to our credit score.

-the total cost of all debt (min. Payments) would go up an extra $20-30 a month with the loan.

-I would pay it off faster due to a lower interest rate. 

If I take the loan, it will “free” up some money for for me to buy tires but this will just lead me into more debt. 

My only other option is to ask the private party for more money to pay for tires, which would just increase my debt to them. I really hate this option as it would lower my capacity to pay for my other bills .

3000: give up all of the gains since before the pandemic (about 3370, which some people called out as inorganically too high/inflated back then. P/E is about 20x now, it was 25x+ during this pre-feb 2020 time frame) because things are ""worse"" than they were then (debatable). 

3500: market has fallen off of a clip in the past 2 trading days. volatility is slowly creeping back. 2 or 3 more ""severe-ish"" bad trading days (2-3% down days) and we're around 3500-3750. if we're really in a ""downtrending bear market"" that's just moving slowly, we're bound to set lower highs (aka we didn't get back to 4800, we got up to 4150) and make lower lows (aka it's time to breakthrough 3800, which was where we got stuck last selloff)

4000: we were just there. market has already hit 3800 this year, hung out, then hung out near 4100 for a while. bad CPI report today but... market could digest, get over it, get back to upward trend. i've never read as many ""i don't DCA, i just swing options, DCA isn't guaranteed, i just want to pick safer stocks, i just want to pick winners like TSLA + APPLE"" in my 10-15+ years on reddit. i'd say retail sentiment is pretty weak. i don't think 4000 excites a lot of people. you've got the ""i DCA 10% of my paycheck and forget about it crowd"" making a lot of noise, but i don't think they drive the market. that's steady. maybe some up their contributions. maybe some get scared and cancel them. kind of all just outlier/noise compared to the masses reevaluating ""stonks only go up"" for the first time in their generation.

4500: inflation likely hasn't peaked, fed just started unwinding balance sheet, more rate hikes to come. gas prices pretty much all time high without an end in sight. maybe upcoming earnings seasons some companies somehow crush it and beat expectations but... i don't personally see us reaching this level in 2022 based on current data + sentiment, but that's also not how markets work and retail investors (like myself) are some of the first to make a prediction out of their ass for zero reason and have it work against them (both a stock going up or down)

5000: if oil wasn't in its current state, maybe inflation wouldn't be as bad. the narrative is that lots of wealthy people have lots of money to drop on $50k vacations, bidding way over asking price on houses, luxury goods, etc. yes, poor people are affected by inflation the hardest and there are lots of poor people, but the top is not hurting and they spend lots. realistically, to go up 28% from where we are now (we need 23% just to get back to our old all time high/52 week high). it'd be a miracle, very unlikely based on lots of data i think",finance,1654928470

*EDIT 2* I've got a little break in work now and I can reply to some. I'm going to paste this to a few responses, so thank you for your time and counsel!!

So I went to the bank, my normal bank of 20+ years, talked to the manager that I personally know, sat with a notary that I personally know and the manager filled the notary in on what happened. 

Notary stamped that we were cancelling the cashier's check.

Told me it would take a while for the funds to be back in my account, but it actually took just a few hours.

So now I've got my down payment in my checking account again.

Monday, I'll go back to the bank and get a cashier's check again for the same amount and deliver it to the title company. I know a few of the employees at the title company, donated to their kid's baseball/dance/basketball/band fundraisers. Again, smallish town.

That's what's ""gonna happen"" but your mind plays little What Ifs . I'm assuming the title company would put a lien on my home if I didn't give them the money. But that's just me assuming. I have no clue as to what would actually happen. I've got paperwork and I've lived in this home all this time, making mortgage payments. 

I'll do the Title company a solid, I own a business in this smallish town and have a great reputation that I don't want tarnished over trying (successfully or unsuccessfully) to screw the title company over. But your mind still looks at that checking account and asks, ""What If?""

*Edit* To clarify, I went to my title company 16 months ago and Handed them my cashier's check, signed paperwork, and closed on the home.

Yesterday, they called me and told me that They FedExed all of their payments received over a 2 day period to... IDK. Their bank? Their home office? But that all of the checks they FedExed off were lost and that they are just now dealing with a negative insurance judgement from the insurance company. 

And could I stop payment on my cashier's check and issue another. The person I spoke with told me it's easier on me than on a few others because I used a cashier's check and my bank could easily tell if the check had been cashed or not (it hadn't been cashed) but some others used a personal check and hadn't, I'm guessing, kept those funds aside the past almost year and a half.",finance,1654929714

(all the numbers are circa because they're in the currency NOK, using conversion 1 NOK = 0.10304 USD, dropping the commas.. I can re-add the commas if requested)

Monthly income: $2576 (post-tax), and no salary increase expected (been with same company for 3 years, still the same salary as when I started, and I suck at salary negotiation anyway...)

Fixed monthly expenses:

* Rent $515

* Electricity $206 (slight fluctuation but basically $206)

* Loan #1 $1236 (Effective interest rate: 12.45% remaining: $42,071, minimum monthly payment circa $1200)

* Loan #2 $412 (Effective interest rate: 0% remaining: $6598, minimum monthly payment: circa $412)

* Travel insurance $12 (I could get rid of this, I'm not traveling anytime soon, but when/if I re-apply for travel insurance, I suspect it is going to cost significantly more, because this one is 20+ years old.. It also covers my bicycle which I use daily and costed $3000 new, if it gets stolen)

* Car insurance $46 (bare minimum liability insurance)

* Bus pass $34

(my employer pays for internet/phone subscription, wife pays for food, so there's practically no expense there) that leaves me with approximately $112 to live off of..

Loans explanation: 1st loan is basically gambling, initial funds for a startup that failed. 2nd loan is not really a loan, back in 2019 i was on a government social welfare program, and in 2022, frikin 3 years later, they said ""we've noticed you received ~$10,303 more than you were supposed to receive in 2019/3-years-ago. you can pay us back $412/month and there's 0 interest rate."" yay...

I think I could live on this, it's not comfortable, but it's doable.. Wife has no fixed income, takes various odd jobs (2 restaurants and 1 hotel nearby ask for her help often), 
 she earns enough for herself and pays for food for the both of us.. problem is, she's pregnant, and we need to find another place to live, suitable for 3 people.. checking the housing market, seems that's going to cost circa ~$900 in rent (up from $515) which would leave me with negative -$273/month... so i feel kind-of fucked, is bankruptcy next?",finance,1654960928

She, the baby, and baby's father have lived with me ever since.  I don't mind and they give me $300 per month to cover excess utilities like water, power, etc.  Granddaughter is 22 years old.

The issue is that I want to move out of California to a state that doesn't tax retirement income.  I will be able to access my tIRA next January.  My SO and I, who both own houses, want to sell and buy something outright for around $400k.  I have over $300k equity in my house and he has even more so we planned on each contributing $200k.

Well, granddaughter and her SO can't find a place to rent.  In our area it is very hard to find anything, I see every day people posting on local FB groups asking.  They have applied at many places.  The only solution is to look further and further away from other family such as her mother (my daughter), aunts and uncles and all of SO's family here.  Daughter just had to move out of her rental because they are selling and she has 3 younger kids so moving in with them is not an option.  His family is in a similar situation.

If I could afford to move without selling this house, I would let them stay here.  Just pay the mortgage, which is only $631 per month and put all utilities in their name.

The only way I could do that is if I take $100k out of my ROTH and $100k out of my tIRA AFTER moving to another state.  I'd still be paying Federal taxes on the $100k which would come up to $18k+.  Family is important and I just can't leave them in the lurch.  My 1 year old great-granddaughter is the happiest child and I'd hate for her mother to have to go to work and leave her all day.

Plus it grows its free cash flow over time after you buy it (most of its holdings benefit from inflation). Junk bonds don't grow their yield after you buy and currently only yield 6.5%. Berkshire is not alone, but it's the model for these types of companies.

7/6 ARM: 4.25% rate with a 5-1-5 cap rate.

30-year fixed: 4.875% rate

The difference is $500/month for the first 7 years. Then the ARM can increase up to 9.25%, in which case I would break even at 14 months, and then the 7/6 would be much more expensive (3K/month).

I'm not sure if I will be living here forever, probably not. Also, I don't know if it would matter in this calculation, but we are doing renovations which hopefully will increase the house value.

A mortgage broker recommended the 7/6 ARM because we will likely go into recession in the next few years, which will hopefully drive the interest rate down, but who knows...

Bitcoin,"Raise interest rates, lower interest rates, it's all zero sum. Bitcoin removes the game entirely.","Low interest rates, like the kind we've had for 10+ years, means ""free money"" for banks to loan out. When money has no scarcity, prices have no ceiling.  House prices have skyrocketed because sellers sell at the upper bounds of what people can borrow.  It's a neverending upwards death spiral and why modern urban centers have median 3BD/2BA house prices of $1.5MM.

This is why we have inflation out of control.  So much money created from thin air over the pandemic.   That spreads well beyond housing to all consumer goods.  

So central banks have to do the unpopular thing: raise interest rates and make money more scarce.  The classic boom and bust of moronic Keynesian economics.  If you're ""lucky"", the bust actually works, the lowest income get hurt the most, but social order remains, prices come down, and the cycle starts again.  The alternative is you can't stop inflation and then the truly terrifying reality begins. 

Bitcoin is fixed, predictable scarcity. It is not created from debt and pulling interest rate levers. If you can't create ""free money"", you actually get real prices (""price discovery""). Houses become affordable because people can only buy what they can afford and sellers can only charge what people can pay. 

Housing supply is further improved because investors won't be interested in inventory when there's no skyrocketing appreciation - there are better places to put capital for higher returns.  You make housing affordable, you create far more stability.

investing,Optimal I Bond Strategies,"I remember a couple months ago on this sub how novel it was to see any bond yielding 7%, let alone a risk free inflation protected bond like the I Bond.

Now, they are yielding above 9%.  Both [Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/janet-yellens-half-hearted-apology-wont-save-the-us-economy/) have admitted that they got inflation wrong by calling it transitory.  Bottom line, looks like high rates on I Bonds are here to stay for a while.

Given that formerly conventional fixed income strategies like laddered CDs and government bond funds are still yielding extremely sub par amounts, this creates an opening for I Bonds, excepting the $10k limit, to be a go-to instrument for a myriad number of circumstances:

* Inflation protection 
* Saving for a down payment on a house
* Fixed income securities for those in retirement
* Playing the spread, i.e. getting XYZ debt for, say, 5% and putting the proceeds into I Bonds yielding over 9% (the logic is the same as incurring low rate debt to put in the market)
* Other short term investments
* Safe Haven for active investment strategies
* etc etc

The limiting factor is the $10k annual limit.  People have been coming up with methods to circumvent this limit, the logic (not the method) being similar to coming up with methods to circumvent the limits for Roth IRAs.  The latter is considered legal and legitimate.  Shouldn't the former also be considered so as well?  If so, shouldn't it be exploited for the incredible results such strategies would yield compared to currently available options?

Two methods I've seen so far:

[Revocable Living Trusts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ulcvj9/setting_up_revocable_living_trusts_for_the/)

[Limited Liability Corporations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v75mv0/can_you_avoid_ibond_limits_with_llcs/)

For those reading the financial news, there have been a lot of comparisons made between markets today and that of the 70s, when inflation was high and returns in the stock market were negative for over a decade.  If other fixed income instruments continue to provide not only zero protection but rather a vulnerability to prolonged inflation, I Bonds become part of an optimal strategy for wealth preservation.

The main downside for I Bonds is that they provide zero real return, and after taxes may actually result in negative real returns.  However, compared to the myriad options in the market today yielding extreme negative real returns (like HYSAs yielding -8% real returns), I Bonds still look great.

Do you agree that I Bonds sans the $10k limit are an optimal investment vehicle for many situations?  Do you agree that exploring options to circumvent the limit are valid?  If so, what other methods do you know can circumvent the $10k limit?

---

edit -  Looking over the comments, it's clear that a lot of people do not understand the term ""real return"" or what it has to do with inflation and I Bonds.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realrateofreturn.asp

1) I bonds track inflation.  I bonds yield 9.62%.  This is a nominal rate of return.

2) Inflation per the CPI calculation I bonds use is 9.62%.

3) 9.62 - 9.62 = 0% real return.

4) Your nominal interest, i.e. 9.62%, is taxed at the federal level.

5) 0% real return - your taxes on interest = negative real return.

A lot of people posting here do not understand that while 9.62% looks great, it is a nominal return.  Accounting for inflation, it provides a zero real return, and after taxes, you actually get a negative real return with I bonds.  Still better than most other investments out there, but it pays to know that you're still losing with this investment, and that in the long run it is not a viable replacement for investments designed to provide a real rate of return over time.

Screaming at the top of your lungs that you don't understand the above is not conducive to a sound investment strategy.",finance,1654976399

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how best to finance a big home improvement project,"My wife and I have been in our house around 3 years. Since we've moved in we've done a couple of projects, by far the biggest of which refinishing our basement. In the next month or so, we are going to be replacing our front steps and fence, which we have the cash to do.

We want to do a big project. We want to redo our main bathroom, our kitchen, refinish the floors and put new floors in the kitchen, and replace a set of steps in the house. 

Our initial thought was that we could roll a loan into our mortgage. The problem is that we would then have to refinance, and we refinanced early in the pandemic when rates were good, so our rate at the moment is 2.99% and we don't want to give that up.  So the next option is a Home Equity Line of Credit. Our concern with that is the variable interest rate. We just don't trust that it won't get to insane levels with the way things have been going. We're just curious if there are any other options we might not be thinking of. 

Just to give some potentially relevant data: we bought the house about 3.5 years for $305k. Our current balance is $246k, and our monthly, including taxes, comes to about $2200. We were recently considering moving and listed the house at $400k and ended up getting offered just shy of $500k. But we backed out of the sale because as good as the selling market is, the buying market was a disaster and we would have had to skip appraisal and inspection to have a shot at anything. So our new plan is to stick around for about 4 more years. So we want to just spend the money now and enjoy the renovations, knowing it's stuff that should increase the value of the home. We do know that the housing market may take a dip at some point, so we at least want to be able to enjoy a nice kitchen and bathroom if we have to stay longer than planned. Any work that is done would be done by my father's construction company, so not only is it reliable, it's likely much cheaper than normal (for example we just put in central air, which most quotes said would be about $20K, and my dad's HVAC did the job for under $10k). My wife makes over $150k (pretax) with annual bonuses over $10k (which we would probably just dump all of into whatever loan we get), while I currently make about $50k, but am on a career track to reliably be making about ~$100k in a 3 years or so (union trade job).

Job A has been stressful with my dept being understaffed, little company training/standards. Some weeks are 40 hours with bursts of 60-80 hr weeks before deadlines.

My income is only about $1200/mo, but I currently live with my parents rent free (for which I am extremely grateful) and I am trying to figure out how on earth to be independent again - enter the bootcamp. 

I have a bit of savings, about $8K, and the bootcamp requires $1K down, but they offer a 24mo interest free payment plan - coming to about $600/mo for 24 months. That would put my expenses RIGHT at $1200/mo, assuming my federal student loan payments remain at $0/mo on IDR when they restart (which they should). 

I am very confident in this bootcamp and my ability to benefit from it, but should I wait to build up more savings? Or just go for it now? I could get another job for a few months and save what I make to put more than $1K down and have smaller payments, but if I get a decent job 6wks out from the end of the program, it would pretty much negate any benefit of waiting, I think, since there is no early payment penalty. If I wait, the next bootcamp cohort starts in January, so it would be a 6mo hold on starting a new career, potentially making way more than double my current income, and I would be able to keep the part-time job I have now for a while with a new full-time job as well.

A meme to start things off, since I'm a long-term holder: https://imgflip.com/i/6je70y                 

And the explanation: In short, the ""dip"" we are experiencing is ordinary trading activity with market circumstances that are beyond what you or I can control (the Fed hiking interest rates, investment strategies switching for large institutions with lots of cash, etc.). If you don't already know what the difference is between a risk-on environment and a risk-off environment, you need to learn it quickly. Right now we are in a ""risk-off"" environment, meaning that people and institutions with money are going with what they call ""safe"" investments - they're putting their money in to index funds, high yield savings accounts, and -in some places- real estate because they want to multiply their dollars. Why? The money printer isn't printing any more, this means wall street wants to take the dollars they have and multiply them and they are forced to do so without the fed's help. Please see this chart and change the timescale to ""all"": https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy                    

I can't predict the future, but this is what I think could happen:               
1. Bitcoin dominance could likely hit 55-60%, on this chart, click ""all"" for the timescale, and then look at what BTC dominance did from **Jan 2018 to December 2018.** https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/   - This will make holding altcoins risky.                
2. When bitcoin drops 10%, you can expect everything else to drop 20%, or at least that's the logical conjecture that I get from just glancing at coingecko - https://imgur.com/a/TToZyW7                 
3. If the fed raising interest rates causes a recession, we know what they *usually* do to ""fix"" the problem - print more money. I don't know when how or even ""if"" this will happen.                 
4. With regards to Eth and the ""merge"" coming up, it *could* be a dark horse. Please do your own research on this topic. At the end of 2018 I remember another big technological development for XRP that caused it to surge by 90% in two days' time.                  
5. In 2017 Bitcoin topped at 20k, in 2018 bitcoin bottomed at 3100. Eth topped at 1400 and bottomed at 85. **I do not think we will see similar losses.**                  
6. A continuation off of point 3 - Michael Saylor's been preaching bitcoin's function as a hedge against inflation since 2020, there must be big financial institutions waiting on the sidelines to buy bitcoin at the 15k-25k range. I know I am.                    

That is all, I hope this helps the new people.                      

**EDIT:** Sorry so some people in the comments prompted me to address that part in the title of this thread where I said ""A few more weeks."" We can expect interest rate hikes to ""attempt"" to tackle inflation, then when mid terms roll along maybe we'll see the fed back off on that so that the present administration that's in power can stay in power.",cryptocurrency,1655007528
investing,An article posted yesterday on the MBS market,"Michael Burry posted a link to this article in a tweet but I think it's worth reposting here (it's worth noting he didn't write the article but merely linked to it in his tweet)


&gt; During the last forty-four years, my days have begun and ended with the mortgage market. Four painful moments stand out. Today makes five. (There have been many more good days, but even the Fairy Godmother has her limits.)
&gt; 
&gt; Mortgages are covered poorly in financial press, as stocks and such are much more entertaining. Today’s events still unfolding will take days for good coverage. Freddie’s weekly survey will not discover today until next Thursday. But the MBS market is real-time, not like old, sleepy S&amp;L days.
&gt; 
&gt; The CPI news this morning was so awful that it changed the bond market’s view of Fed trajectory, and the weakest sector broke. In bond jargon, MBS went “no-bid.” No buyers for MBS. Then a few posted prices beyond borrower demand, not wanting to buy except at penalty prices. Overnight the retail consequence has been a leap from roughly 5.50% to 6.00% for low-fee 30-fixed loans.
&gt; 
&gt; The physics of collisions... the second one does the harm. When your car hits a telephone pole, no problem. Then, after a slight lag, trouble comes when you hit the inside of your car. Same thing in football: helmet on helmet is all-okay... until your brain hits the inside of your skull.
&gt; The same physics govern housing collisions with mortgages. At the new year mortgages were still three-ish. In February, four. At the end of March, five. May, five-and-a-half. Historically, a two-percentage-point rise from cyclical trough has iced housing, the freeze underway a month ago. Now up by three points, and _double_ January.
&gt; 
&gt; The pause in housing between the first collision and second is elongated because of human nature. Someone desperate to buy a house is still desperate, and modestly relieved to buy even at a higher price and rate so long as not forced into an unlimited auction. Now it’s time for Wile E. Coyote in his Acme sneakers, running off into thin air and all okay until he looks down.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking down... MBS are such a weird market that other markets have not processed what is happening. Stocks are down 2% today, but would be down a hell of a lot more if considering what a full-stop to housing will mean.
&gt; 
&gt; Another marker of MBS distress: the 10-year T-note had held 3.00% since April, the important top in 2012 and 2018. Trading 3.05% yesterday, now 3.20% -- retail mortgages jumped *triple* that amount. The 10s/mortgages spread today is almost 300bps and double the 10s’ yield. Inconceivable. The Fed telltale 2-year T-note had held 2.70% since April, 2.85% yesterday, today 3.05% adding only one more .25% hike to the 2-cast, which is not enough to explain MBS overnight.
&gt; 
&gt; **Today’s CPI Trigger.** Markets were braced for a bad report, but not this. Overall CPI jumped 1.0% in May. Any thought of deceleration... ka-blooie. CPI 8.6% in the last year, accelerating under pressure from Ukraine energy dislocation.
&gt; 
&gt; Many observers this morning say that the CPI news is so lousy that there is no point in looking at the details. Wrong. From the onset of Covid to Ukraine, our inflation problem was supply chain, mostly manufactured goods. Since Ukraine, it has shifted to energy.
&gt; 
&gt; Different elements of CPI have different weightings, which conceal the effect of energy in a crisis like this. In May the energy index within CPI... up 34.6% in May alone. In an event like this, the notion of excluding the high-volatility “core” is meaningless.   
&gt; *Everything* requires energy. The uppers and soles of your Nikes are fossil fuel. Food has its own Ukraine issue, but energy is the problem, from fuel to fertilizer.
&gt; 
&gt; Oil was $75/bbl pre-Ukraine, then held just above $100, now $120. Natural gas from normal $4-$5/mbtu... since Ukraine $9. The May increase in fuel oil, $16.9%. May utility natural gas, up 8% in the month. You can see component-by-component, month-by-month CPI here [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) Table A.
&gt; 
&gt; **Those Other Four Moments...**
&gt; 
&gt; 1. 1979, Saturday of Columbus Day Weekend, Paul Volcker announced that the Fed would allow the cost of money to float as high as necessary. Mortgages 11% on Friday, on Tuesday after the holiday 13%. However! That was 15 years into entrenched inflation, oil ten times as expensive in 1979 as 1972, and our economy just beginning energy conservation and new supply. All incomes ramped right along with inflation. The US economy was a “things” economy, with little overseas competition for union-heavy US labor.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. 1994, February... the cost of money coming out of recession 1.00%, by year-end 1994 to 5.25% -- but in a disinflationary world, the cost of money was one-half the cycle peak four years before. 1994, February to May, mortgages from 7% to 9% -- that magic two-point rise flattened housing, and the Fed had to cut in 1995 to dodge recession. The new mortgage peak, stabilizing near 8% was down from 11% in 1990, and we enjoyed a genuine and rare soft landing.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. 2007, July... you had to be deep in the mortgage racket to understand the first collision. Subprime and Jumbos went no-bid, and stayed there. The Fed was slow to understand the credit panic, began frantic cuts the following winter from 5.25% to 2.00%. But mortgages did not respond, stuck above 6.00%.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. 2008, July... the no-bid expanded to all mortgages, even government guaranteed. The 10-year T-note anticipating recession and worse fell to 3.50% while retail mortgages rose to 7.00%. That 350bps spread is the closest comparable to today’s 300bps.
&gt; 
&gt; **Now What.** At Thanksgiving 2008 the credit markets (all markets) were rescued by Ben Bernanke’s genius, announcing quantitative easing -- buying enough MBS and Treasurys to unlock markets in which all had been afraid to buy.
&gt; 
&gt; Today... is it a coincidence that MBS have blown simultaneously with the Fed’s flip from QE buying to allowing runoff and threatening to sell? The weak break first. MBS are weird, and weird under stress is weak.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed has had a plan, Powell becoming more concise each day: We will raise the cost of money until inflation comes under control. “It is our job to calibrate demand to supply.” A good, tidy, sorta mathematic way to proceed. But destruction of demand has limits, and this morning we hit one.
&gt; 
&gt; In today’s US, nobody is prepared to deal with inflation as it has developed in the last 90 days. Inflation can drop and even stabilize above the Fed’s target, but the world is only three months into finding alternate energy for Europe’s oil and gas imports from Russia. Including natural gas, something like 15% of the world’s energy supply has been dislocated.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps half will quickly be redirected. India and China are buying at a deep discount from Vladimir, which makes available much of the supply which those two used to buy elsewhere, Europe lining up. But Russian production is already suffering, a net and permanent loss. Alternate supplies require alternate delivery, gas especially tough -- absent pipelines, all gas deliveries are dependent on scarce LNG ships and terminals. Coal normal, $50-$100/ton... today $395.
&gt; 
&gt; In this circumstance, the Fed’s demand destruction has all the wisdom of Xi’s zero-covid. In a rational world, if the party in power in DC were not encumbered by climateers, we would turn on the hose, take every step to unimpede production and delivery. Instead of threatening to tax windfall profits, we would offer incentive price guarantees to protect producers from the energy price drop certain to lie ahead. This is an energy problem, not some amorphous inflation amoeba.
&gt; 
&gt; Below the 10-year T-note in the last twenty years. In 2018 there were a few days with trades above 3.20%, so in theory 10s have not broken that critical support. Theories like that tend to last a few days. The Fed has to decide how much destruction it has in mind.

CryptoCurrency,Why does crypto seem to move in line with stock markets?,"Sorry if I got it wrong since I don’t know a lot about crypto. 

I had the impression that coins in the crypto market are pieces of secure digital currency that act independently from stock markets, and serve as an alternative to the traditional fiat currency we’ve all known and “loved” for the last whatever. And that ETH and Bitcoin where two of the few coins that are a beacon of hope for adoption (as two of the very few number of coins that actually have a meaningful utility).

I have no problem with the fact that the price of crypto coins fluctuate, I mean crypto is still relatively new and there are factors that will contribute to price fluctuation, like any fiat currency. 
But why does crypto now seem to move when the stock market moves? Where has the link come from? 

Is it because we have crypto whales? Low market sentiment as more people who traditionally dabble in the stock market enter this arena then chicken out if they withdraw their money from the stock market? Geopolitics and monetary policy? Something else?

What gives? I thought the whole purpose of crypto was the fact that is was detached from traditional monetary structures and institutions 🤷🏾‍♀️

personalfinance,Withdraw Mega Backdoor Roth Contributions for downpayment?,"I'll be starting a high paying job soon, after spending years of being a low paid PhD student. I'm working on a solid financial plan in order to catch up for retirement and meet my other goals such as buying a house, etc. I plan to max out my Roth IRA (via backdoor if needed) and 401K. I'm wondering what I should do with the leftover amount after that? Here is my current situation:

1. While I want to buy a home, I don't know when I would be ready to buy a home as I'm starting a new job in a new city and am currently single. Depending on how things go, I may be ready to **buy a home within 3 to 7 years.**
2. I will likely need to save a **MASSIVE downpayment** amount over several years as that home will most probably be **in a HCOL** (due to my occupation). So, I would like to start planning from it NOW.
3. My **income is likely to grow** a fair bit during these 3-7 years.

I want to save the excess amount in a way, that if I don't need it for the downpayment (due to an increase in income, an unlikely move to a LCOL, meeting a partner who also contributes, gift from family, etc), it can continue to grow for retirement.

I have three options:

1. Contribute the excess amount via Mega Backdoor Roth. When I'm ready to buy a house, withdraw 0-100% of these excess contributions for downpayment if needed. The advantage is that if I don't need to withdraw everything then whatever remains will continue to grow, and can be withdrawn tax free in retirement. 
2. Contribute the excess amount to a taxable brokerage.
3. 50% in #1 and 50% in #2

**Is there any reason to NOT do option 1?** Are there disadvantages that I'm not aware of?

**Should I split the amount between a HYSA/ CD/ I-Bonds and one of the above 3 options? What should that split look like?** (I know Series I-Bonds are a no-brainer at this time, but by the time I start my job, the interest rate may not be as high. If it is, then ofc, I'll max that out before I put anything in the mega backdoor or taxable brokerage).

**Also, since I may need this excess amount earlier, how should the stock vs. bond split for the invested amount be (regardless of whether it's in a Roth or taxable brokerage)?** For my current Roth IRA, since I'm only 28, I'm doing 100% stock (70% US and 30% International), and will rebalance to add bonds several years down the line. I plan to stick with this for the $20,500 in the 401K and $6000 in the Roth IRA per year for now. I don't however, feel comfortable using this split for the excess amount I contribute to the mega backdoor roth, as I believe that there's a good 70% probability that I will withdraw at least some of that money within the next 7 years.",finance,1655015455

dogecoin,welcome to the crash,"Good morning! It's Sunday June 12, and before anything else I would like to say

DON'T PANIC!

Back in 2008 I was stationed in Germany, reasonably well invested (mostly in transportation stocks), and watched the housing bubble take the market into, well your seeing it now. I had invested ""wisely"" as they had said and lost everything I had put in. The reason I lost is due in part to my own panic. 

DON'T PANIC! 

As I watched the market take a nose dive and my own investments become worth almost nothing I pulled out and the thousands I had put in over the period of three years came back to me as a few hundred dollars. That was the major mistake I had made. When the market started to recover I was deployed and had so little cash available for investment that I bought penny stocks, another mistake I made, but one I did make a little profit on. 

DON'T PANIC!

Crypto isn't a stock, and though that has been said over and over again, it should be stated one more time at least. Dogecoin is a currency. Is it going to drop? HELL YEAH, everything publicly traded goes down in a market correction unless it is supported in the case of Volkswagen back in 2008. It doesn't have to die however. What we have here in dogecoin is an opportunity if you are willing to embrace it. 

HOW TO FACE THE APOCALYPSE WITH A CAN DO ADDITUDE 

You are going to see every kind of FUD and desperation to include a few you've never imagined. Understand you can't save everyone from losing hope. Paper hands are going to paper hand. Inflation is probably going to continue to rise as the FED prints yet more money in order to bail out their corporate masters, and prices are going to get worse as well as shortages. This is where you come in and potentially save the day. Let's take something like toilet paper, and we all remember that shortage, but what most people don't know and didn't think to look up is that toilet paper is very easy to make. There are DIY videos on YouTube specifically to make toilet paper. What I would suggest is contact your local newspaper if you have one and ask if you can purchase the previous days issue at a reduced price. Instant supply of paper that they will usually be happy to unload. Make your recycled newspaper toilet paper, and advertise that you have it. BE HONEST ABOUT IT. It won't be fancy or even on a roll. Tell people on Facebook in your community upcycle what you have available and that to keep it in stock you have set a price on it, say $0.75 per pack if it makes a small profit. Offer dogecoin as a way to pay as well. 

PATIENCE IS KEY

It won't happen overnight, but there will most likely, considering how bad this crash most likely will be, as well as duration, be quite a few who will consider your offer and even may open a crypto account as dogecoin will NOT be affected by the inflation that the dollar will. 

This is not sound advice from a forex or financial expert, this is just lessons learned by an old soldier who has seen a bit too much, and put into practice this same thing back when the pandemic happened. It doesn't have to be toilet paper either. If you have a garden, sell some of your excess crops or flowers. If we  are really in for another great depression, don't wait for your employer to go under before acting upon your own preservation. Together we can get through this, and when we are on the other side, DOGE WILL BE STRONGER THAN EVER.",cryptocurrency,1655033091
personalfinance,Should my parents pay off their mortgage or invest?,"My parents have 60,000 left on their mortgage. The interest rate is 4%. Currently they pay 2,000 each month with 1,000 going towards the principal. They have enough to pay off the mortgage in an IRA that is uninvested.

However, with the markets' potential to go lower over time and possibly locking up my parents' money.

(car insurance, health insurance, and phone plan.) my car is paid off and credit card debt is the only debt that i have. as of right now i have somewhere between 5,800-6,000 in debt, mostly from covering living expenses and things such as car repairs and vet appointments. i've also made some irresponsible purchases with the cards, such as plane tickets or gas to visit home to see my family when maybe i should have just told them i couldn't afford it. (i moved out of state in 2020). it's spread amongst four cards, two of which are with credit unions that don't have super high interest rates. i make all my payments on time but can't really afford to go very much above the minimum. my credit score tends to hover around the low 700's. also i feel like i should mention that i just got approved for SNAP benefits, so i'll be receiving around $100 a month to go towards groceries. given that one's monthly income has to be $1,396 or below to receive benefits in my state...yeah, i'm barely making it out here. 

credit karma keeps giving me recommendations for personal loans, and i also get lots of junk mail offers for the same thing. in theory, it sounds like a good idea: instantly pay off my CC debt, have only one  payment to deal with instead of juggling four, increase my credit score, and potentially pay off the loan sooner than i would all of the cards. 

but i also worry that the monthly payment for the loan will be higher than what i'm paying now for my CC payments ,or that the interest rate on the loan would be higher and put me into further debt. but at the same time i'm paying like $250 on average every month (give or take) on these damn CC payments so maybe it would actually be less... if you couldn't tell i'm not the best with money. i'm going back to school soon to get a better job and an actual salary so that my money can go towards more important things like saving for retirement or buying a house, maybe in 4 years or so i'll even be financially stable enough to start a family with my partner. i'm scared that if i don't change something with this situation soon i won't be able to dig myself out. i'm super embarrassed about this debt and it causes me a lot of stress every day, my family already helps and has helped me so much that i really don't want to have to bother them with this too. my mom was so kind and sent me money to help me pay my bills last month because i got COVID and missed an entire week of work. asking them to pay this ridiculous debt for me is not an option. i'm sorry this is so long and i'm rambling, it's my first time asking for help and really just laying everything out. 

so long story short, is a personal loan worth it? what's the best way to go about getting one, online? through a local credit union or bank? i know my interest rate is likely to be higher because my credit score isn't amazing, but how high is too high?

edit: thank you all for your advice, i think i am going to research personal loans and find one with a lower interest rate than my credit cards. having one payment will also mean i can have my one payment date be when i get my first paycheck for the month, so i can get that big bill out of the way first. having one payment will also be less stress, instead of chasing the minimum payment for 4 different cards with different due dates. i’m also going to get back into the pizza delivery world on my off time as a second job to increase my income, as much as i can while still getting my food benefits.",finance,1655041138

investing,What happens when we've gone to basically the lowest negative interest rates possible and then there's a recession?,"Hi guys,

Let me expand, say we hike inflation cools, then there's another recession prompting a cut in rates into negative territory. Yes I know other countries have done this, but I'm talking a little more, like bottom bottom bottom of the negative pit to the point where any further and banks would lose money lending out at that rate so it's in real terms the bottom.

Say in that case they gradually start hiking up but after first hike, there's another huge multi-factor catalyst causing another recession and the central bank wants to lower again.

*However,* because it's so low in negative territory already, they simply cannot go lower; well they could go back down to before that one hike they did, so assume they want back down one bump, *then what*.

Let me summarize my question:

**What happens when the central bank has gone into negative interest rates so low - some countries are negative already, but there's a tiny bit more space I've ready in theory they could go down so this is a scenario where they're essentially there - but it's not enough to act as a cushion that prevents said recession. What happens next?**

I would think a hyper-deflationary spiral is what comes next... and a great depression that comes with it. Then what, how do we get out?

btc,Novel bitcoin-cash-faucet using introspection,"' spent the last few days developing and testing a faucet smart contract using the new introspection features from the May 15th hard-fork. 

It's a contract that simply says, ""Send all the money back to this contract in the first output, minus some set amount (1000 by default)."" with the condition, ""you can't spend the contract until a certain number of blocks (1 by default)."" 

This contract allows anyone to do whatever they want with the remaining 1000, provided they also pay the transaction fee from that amount.

It's currently a command line npm package, but a static webpage is in the cards.

It's [on-chain](https://explorer.bitcoinunlimited.info/address/bitcoincash:pq75zmtt8d84nqnxv8vx3wj06mmzlhjnwuwprm4szr), so the infrastructure is just the main Bitcoin Cash chain, or testnet4 if preferred.

Instructions for using are [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoin-cash-faucet#Usage)

It is open source [unlicense] of course: https://github.com/2qx/bitcoin-cash-faucet

Feel free to test it if you want some free BCH or tBCH.

So I'm devastated but at this moment, still trying to focus on surgery recovery.  Last night I noticed a centimeter opening between two staples so what I thought had happened is that one staple had worked itself loose. Unfortunately after this mornings bathroom activity, I can see much better what it is: about a 3 inch portion of skin is dead/dying and the opening is about 2 to 3 inches in total. Is this an emergency or could this repair wait until tomorrow? My city has 2 ER vets but both are at capacity (I called both). My other option is another ER Vet about 1.5 hours away. Or, wait til tomorrow and go back to my regular vet who performed the surgery. Also, before I realized how serious this was (before bathroom break), I fed her, so she hasn't been fasting like one should before another surgery. Although she isn't really drinking, which concerns me.

The opening looks a little grey, due to the dead tissue, but overall it isn't bleeding. And it does not smell good of course. I will add that she has had constant serum-like drips since surgery (light pink, watered down blood, not sure of the technical name for that). But my vet said that was normal.

stocks,Fed funds futures traders now see a 21% chance of a 75-basis-point hike in June,"saw this on reddit and thought it was interesting.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/va340q/fed_funds_futures_traders_now_see_a_21_chance_of/)

[Source Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/catastrophically-bad-inflation-report-is-boosting-chances-of-a-75-basis-point-hike-in-june-or-july-11654876860).

Friday’s consumer-price index report for May — which showed the annual headline U.S. inflation rate climbing to 8.6% in May, with few signs of having peaked — is boosting the chances of a jumbo-sized rate increase by monetary-policy makers as soon as next week, and eliciting dire warnings that central bankers have completely lost control of prices.

Fed funds futures traders now see a 21% chance of a 75-basis-point hike in June, up from just 3.6% on Thursday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Economists at Barclays BARC, -3.69% and Jefferies backed up the shifting expectations, by indicating they expect policy makers to deliver a hike of that magnitude at their June 14-15 meeting.

Beneath the issue of where the Fed goes from here is a much more fundamental and serious problem: Some observers fear the U.S. central bank has already effectively lost control of inflation. May’s price gains were broad-based — hitting everything from shelter to gasoline and food, as well as the narrower gauge, the so-called core reading, that excludes food and energy. The data were “catastrophically bad” for both the Fed and Americans, said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer of Nashville-based Laffer Tengler Investments, which oversees $1.1 billion.

“What we saw in this report which was disappointing and a little alarming is that the core reading, excluding food and energy, came in hotter than expected and that’s after we dropped off from a very high number for April 2021,” she said via phone. “This is a much more persistent and stickier kind of inflation that takes years to work through the system.”

“The Fed has been wrong at every single turn and we should be seeing a 75 basis point hike at the June meeting,” Tengler said. “The question is whether they can surprise and I don’t think we are going to see that. Every time they delay, that allows inflation to run rampant and this raises the odds of recession.” Equity markets will be “ugly and choppy through summer because inflation numbers are not going to improve.”

Indeed, traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings have expected a string of annual headline CPI readings that rises to as high as 8.8% in August and September, before settling to 8% for October. Meanwhile, U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to a record low this month.

September outlook

“All in all, the report should be of great concern for the Fed given that price gains in both the headline and the core measures show no signs of abating, and we expect prices to continue to register firm gains in the near term,” TD Securities strategists Oscar Munoz, Priya Misra and others wrote in a note. “We expect the Fed to maintain its aggressive tightening bias in the months ahead, look for the Committee to hike rates by 50bp both next week and in the July FOMC meeting, and believe a 50bp hike in September may not be out of the question.”

A team at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -5.65%, led by Jan Hatzius, agreed with TD’s September assessment, by saying “we now expect the Fed to hike the funds rate by 50 bps in September (vs. +25bp previously), in addition to +50bp moves in June and in July.”

“Today’s report should extinguish any pretense that a ‘pause’ in rate hikes will likely be appropriate by the end of summer, as the Fed is clearly still behind the eight ball on bringing inflation under control,” said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede.

“Investors should expect the Federal Reserve to continue on its 50-bp rate hike path next week and beyond until inflation shows meaningful signs of decelerating toward the Fed’s 2-3% target range,” Pride said.

“Today’s CPI report was a doozy,” said Tom Graff, head of investments at Facet Wealth.

“While we knew the headline number would probably come in high due to food and energy prices, consensus was that the month-over-month Core CPI would slow sequentially,” he wrote in an email. “Unfortunately that didn’t happen. Headline CPI came in a full 1% for the month and a 40-year high 8.6% for the year, and core stayed steady at +0.6% for the month and 6.0% for the year.” 

“The most concerning part of this report was its breadth. The monthly number wasn’t driven by a few items. Most of the major categories actually accelerated price increases month-over-month. Most observers agree that broader inflation is more likely to persist.”

“Friday’s inflation data suggests the ‘peak inflation’ debate may be premature,” said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management. “The idea of peak inflation assumes that our supply chain disruptions are over and won’t recur anytime soon and I’m not so sure we can be confident of that.”

“Investors remain too confident that the Federal Reserve will be able to control inflation,” Davis said by email. “We should not take the Fed’s ability to control inflation as a given.”",finance,1655054702

economy,"Vertical Environmentalism, Land Grab Amidst Reductions of Agricultural Inefficiencies","In July 2000 Country Life ran an editorial headlined “What happens to the farmland that nobody wants?”  Farming, it said, was in crisis. Milk prices were so low that dairy herds were being dispersed and various experts predicted that “within the next couple of years” it was entirely possible that “large areas of the familiar West Country landscape of hedgerows and small fields might be abandoned” The same would eventually happen in much of the rest of the country, it said. It was “possible to imagine” that some beef and sheep farming might continue if costs could be slashed. It was also possible to imagine that land in the south with pretty houses on it might be attractive to urban buyers. But elsewhere? No chance. (MoneyWeek) 

Oh, for a time machine. In 2000, the average price of an acre of prime arable land in the UK was around £3,000. By 2015 that had leapt to over £9,000. There was a post-Brexit wobble as the UK exited the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy. But prices rose just over 6 per cent last year and are now back to near their £9,000-plus peaks. You can buy land for less, of course: Savills, the estate agent, still shows land classed as “poor livestock” priced at £4,000 an acre. The question is whether you should. The price of UK land has long been divorced from the yields you actually get from farming. It is as much a function of the subsidy regime and the ability to use it as a way of avoiding inheritance tax as anything else. (MoneyWeek) 

In my own opinion, mass amounts of farmlands seem to always be a reoccurring theme, especially with William Gates' recent purchase of a ton of acres as well as recent food shortages. The real question being; how is this going to tie into the global environmentalism and possible 'humanities' of the land variety.

 Vertical Hydroponics

Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil in a horizontal or vertical fashion, where mineral nutrients are provided through the water. Hydroponic systems that allow growing of plants in a vertical fashion are known as vertical hydroponics. Vertical hydroponics works by using conventional hydroponic techniques in a vertical, gravity fed system. The nutrient-rich water is fed from the top and collected at the bottom. Vertical hydroponics has various advantages over traditional crop production methods including:

* Allows for high density yield per unit area.
* Good for small sunny places like balconies, patios and rooftops.
* It allows year around production inside.
* It often can provide more than 90 percent efficiency in water use.
* No soil-borne diseases.

 Tower Garden

A tower garden, also called a window farm is a system of vertical hydroponics, which includes an A-Frame hydroponic system, hydroponic wall and cascades of bottles. It can be used for growing various crops like strawberry, lettuce, Swiss chard, herbs, spinach, kale, broccoli and flowering petunia. There are various online sources to get these systems, which can cost around $500 or more, but you can build your own tower garden for much less. It can also be used for growing plants indoors if lights are provided above the tower, which is popular in urban areas with only a small space for gardening. The tower garden design described here can hold 28 plants per tower and two towers can be placed in a 5-foot x 5-foot space, producing 56 plants at one time (Figure 1). The design can be modified according to preference. For example, tow-ers can be hung from the top and can drain to a single tank to collect the nutrient solution. Materials listed below can be found at a hardware store, except the net pots which can be purchased from hydroponic dealers or online. If tower material is modified, make sure to use food grade material.

The introduction of mass commercial hydroponics will become a major blow to inefficiencies in contributor's food economy as well as spacing problem for agriculturally, (commercial cropping) land as it revolutionizes space used as well as reduces need for pesticides and wasteful water usage.

My ex has unfortunately been sabotaging me financially and timewise as well, where I need to save money at this point, get my own place, and get back into school full time while being a single mom of my two year old little boy (my life and love).

I don't have any money for a down payment (maybe at most $500-$600), so I have to trade in.

All car sales men keep telling me too that banks or no one is financing cars older than ten years old and the older the car, the higher the interest rate. 

My credit score through Experian is showing right now at 627. 

So what I need help deciding on is whether.....

1.) I should refinance ( Current APR is 14.61%; bought the car in August 2021)

2) or whether I should trade in for these options that I've been looking at for me and my son to save money and also afford to live in a place.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loan all at once?,"I have a private loan with Sallie Mae. I calculated the pay off and it’s $4,100.some cents and an interest rate of 11.625%.

I’m currently paying $100/month for this loan and I was thinking of paying off $1k at once and then increasing my monthly payment to $200 and paying more some months.

I ALSO have $11k in my savings and I was thinking “should I just pay the $4k 🤔”

What do you guys think is the best option? Maybe another option?

Please ask for more info if you need it.

personalfinance,Student loans and what to do with my savings,"So basically just asking for advice since I don’t really know too much about personal finance.

I have $65k in private student loans and $19k in federal student loans. I currently have no other debt. 

I have about $21k in my savings and $3k in checking at all times. I currently bring home roughly $3,800 a month and after all my expenses I’m left with roughly $2400 that I have been throwing at my private student loans. 

By May of next year I will have been able to pay my private student loans all the way down to $24k which I was planning just to start throwing my savings at (yes I know not the best idea, but I’m ready to get rid of my student loans at all costs). In the meantime my money is just sitting in my savings account accruing roughly $1 a month. Is there anything or anywhere better to store that money or at least a portion of it for a year that can help it grow? Should I throw some into a hysa for a year or should I invest some of it somewhere? Just not sure what to do with it other than just sitting in savings until it’s time to be used. 

Thanks in advance!",finance,1655069476
personalfinance,Can I afford to buy a house? The down payment will be almost 100% of my liquid savings?,"Hi all, I'm interested in buying a nice 1 bed + 1 office (1k sq ft) condo conversions in San Francisco. The HoA is less than $200/month so it's still affordable. I'd love to have a larger place to live where I can reasonably accommodate guests, including my parents when they visit, and be able to renovate/decorate to my liking. I currently live in a $1400/month studio which isn't very nice, the walls are thin, the garbage truck wakes me up at 6am every morning, and there are roaches. I feel like I make enough money to splurge on some place better to live, but I wonder if it's still a bad idea given the economy + interest rates + market?

The house is listed for under $1 million, has been on the market for a while (so no bidding wars afaik), and the agent says that they'll definitely consider offers. (What a difference from the old bay area housing market! We're really hurtin' here.) I'll probably make an offer at $900k give or take. Biggest caveat is that the down payment will be almost 100% of my liquid savings, which sounds like a somewhat bad idea.

My financials:

Salary: $250k/year + $200k/year in non-public/illiquid pre-IPO stonks at a company that won't IPO for at least the next 5 years

Savings:

Illiquid stonks: $220k + costs $48k/year in liquid dollars because I pay cash instead of stonk to max out my exposure to the illiquid stonks. However I don't have to do this going forward if I choose to stop.

Investment account: $125k (markets make me sadface)

Coinbase: $60k 🥲

401k: $178k (I only started saving like 3 years ago because when I first graduated college I was of the mindset ""Why save for retirement when you can spend the money now?"")

I bought and pay for a house for my parents and siblings who don't pay me rent: \~$70k equity paid off + down payment and $1k/month mortgage 🥲

That's it :(

My expenditures:

My total takehome is about $12k/month, and my post-tax bonus takehome is about $20k/year.

The total monthly payment of this house will be $5k/month.

Credit cards: $4k/month (I need to cut down on this. It's mostly eating out, travel, and cosmetic stuff like dermatological treatments and plastic surgery.)

Current rent: $1400/month

Mortgate: $1k/month

Taxes for stonks: $4k/month

I think this house is lovely and is in a location that hopefully won't be demolished in the next big earthquake BUT it's straight up all of the investment + coinbase account and it feels like the worst time to sell (especially those coins). Plus with 5+% interest rates?? But I don't know... Thoughts?? Tysm.",finance,1655069805

Anyways, I am currently 31 years old. My income is about 47k before taxes/health insurance. I just got a slight raise coming next week so don’t have an exact number.

Anyways, I have about 150k saved in my savings account. The house I am planning to purchase is going to be in the 150-160k range. 

My original plan was to have a 100k ish loan. But with the interest rates going back up I’m wondering if I should put more down that way I can live a little more comfortably and stress free about house payments etc. 

Is there any harm in doing say 60-70k down on a house? I don’t have a car payment currently. I am planning to pick up a second car 10-20k max that is more reliable than my current car (paid for). 

I’ve seen different opinions on investing my money elsewhere but with the current market and inflation it’s not something I am really comfortable doing. 

Just wanted to get some input here from people who have more finance experience than me!

investing,"Stagflation was about energy price, not monetary policy.","Before you read any of my words, [look closely at this graph](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart). Note that it is in today’s prices (e.g. adjusted for inflation). Before even looking at the 1970’s, look at the 50’s and 60’s. Each decade brought new incremental lows to the price of oil, and society was designed around the premise of cheap oil, from travel to manufacturing to home heating. Little effort was made on efficiency, because for almost 3 decades oil got progressively cheaper each year. Like a Thanksgiving turkey, the American economy loved the farmer that fed it from December to November.

Now we come to stagflation. Oil went from $28 a barrel in December 1973 to  $63 in January of 1974 - just a month later. The historical high price of oil was $32 in 1948. To put this in modern terms, it would be like oil hitting $300 a barrel by mid-July from $120 now. This energy shock is what caused the twin pillagers of economic stagnation (they laid me off!) and inflation (it costs me how much to fill up my tank?). The problem was not bad monetary policy in 1973. I mean, it might have been bad, but  it didn’t matter much at all compared to the overnight explosion of prices in the necessary commodity that underpinned the global economy, from food to airplanes. I really must emphasize the food point, without tractors and gas we can’t feed 98% of the world with only 2% working the fields. Minus fossil fuels, that ratio flips - you need 98% of the population farming to feed the lucky 2% who can have a different job. That’s what made the medieval era different. 

Why did oil skyrocket like that? [Because America’s support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war of 1973 led to the OPEC oil embargo](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/oil-shock-of-1973-74). As we are learning now, if an oil cartel decides to pick a side in a war, they can take a pound of flesh. Though Russia is only a fraction as dominant now as OPEC was then. 

I’ve seen folks debating whether Volker’s deflationary and merciless interest rate hikes helped lower demand enough. I’ve seen folks suggest Reagan’s inflationary and optimistic tax cuts somehow voodooed the economic back into shape. Both are efforts to paint the target on top of the bullet holes already in the wall. Oil peaked in May of 1980 and dropped off a cliff in January 1986*. The reason for that collapse? [Saudi Arabia wanted to take more market share and increased production](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1986/06/1986b_bpea_gately_adelman_griffin.pdf). The lesson of stagflation isn’t some cautionary tale about monetary policy. It’s about the price of energy, full stop. Preventing Volker or Reagan had anything to do with it more than on the margins is just an exercise in comfort - it’s nice to think that we can choose leaders who might fix something. In reality they are all riding the same elephant, and they aren’t the ones telling it what to do. Some, however, do a better job of convincing others that they are in charge. 

The one thing we could (and did) meaningfully do that was in our control was reduce waste - double pane windows to keep heat inside in winter, smarter manufacturing processes, more fuel efficient cares, etc. The decline in price from 1980 to 1986 was the product of getting smarter about energy use. Saudi Arabia just saw the writing on the wall and decided to grab market share while it could. It was in their interest to encourage uncritical oil consumption long term. 

Any news article or comment you see that brings up the dreaded specter of stagflation had better provide a reason for why we change-point jump into a new energy pricing regime, because that’s what it takes. Be as pessimistic or optimistic as you’re intuition allows about what’s coming, but it’s important to know the history of stagflation given how much it’s coming up. And that history is basically: you are in less control than you think you are. 

Now, with all that in mind, scroll down to the [third graph on this page](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth). This (long term, not short term) is the most important thing happening right now, just like the OPEC embargo was the most important thing happening during stagflation. The cheaper energy is, the less we have to think about it, and the more we can think about computers, social networks, graphics cards, AI, EVs, etc. The fun economy starts after the “eat your vegetables” economy of energy price ends.

I know feds are increasing the rates to fight the inflation. so that means with the 40 year record high inflation, feds will continue to increase the rates even though if there is a recession?

what happened in the 2008? did rates went down that time?

I wanted to buy a house but not sure it is the best time now. I thought the same way when pandemic hit few years back and thought market will crash. but the opposite happen. Price and demand went up. Now i'm afraid the rates might go up due to the fed rate hikes (may be up to 7%-8%) and if that happened i will not be able to afford house ever.

CryptoCurrency,Sick Stablecoins Can’t Infect Financial Markets [WSJ],"**Below is an article by Niall Ferguson and Manny Rincon-Cruz with the Wall Street Journal. Good read with a positive take, even though LUNA/UST losses were terrible for many people.**

The pre­cip­i­tous fall of Terra has re-en­er­gized crypto skep­tics. On May 10, amid Ter­ra’s col­lapse, Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Janet Yellen ar­gued be­fore the Sen­ate Bank­ing Com­mit­tee that sta­ble­coins cre­ate “run risks, which could threaten fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity, risks as­so­ci­ated with the pay­ment sys­tem and its in­tegrity.” Clearly, not every to­ken that calls it­self a “sta­ble­coin” is sta­ble, but Ms. Yellen is wrong to think that sta­ble­coins pose a sys­temic risk to fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity.

A true sta­ble­coin is a dol­lar-like to­ken col­lat­er­al­ized by at least $1 worth of as­sets. The best known sta­ble­coins, Teth­er’s USDT and Cir­cle’s USDC, ac­count for $72.5 bil­lion and $54 bil­lion, re­spec­tively, in cir­cu­lat­ing sup­ply. Op­por­tunis­tic reg­u­la­tors and politi­cians, no­tably the Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion’s Gary Gensler and Sen. Eliz­a­beth War­ren, call sta­ble­coins “wild­cat banks” and ar­gue that they are sus­cep­ti­ble to runs.

But Tether and Cir­cle are dif­fer­ent from banks. Un­like bank de­posits, USDT and USDC are re­deemable only in amounts ex­ceed­ing $100,000 and only to a se­lect group of Teth­er’s and Cir­cle’s fi­nan­cial part­ners. In­stead, most hold­ers of these to­kens can sell them on var­i­ous ex­changes or swap them for goods and ser­vices. More im­por­tantly, Tether and Cir­cle also can de­lay or sus­pend re­demp­tions at any time—his­to­ry’s time-tested so­lu­tion to runs. This keeps their bal­ance sheets in­tact and makes it im­pos­si­ble to “short” ei­ther by at­tack­ing its dol­lar peg.

The only real risk to Tether and Cir­cle is losses on their bond hold­ings. On May 12, Teth­er’s chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer, Paolo Ar­doino, clar­i­fied that “in the last six months,” the com­pany had “re­duced 50% the size of the com­mer­cial pa­pers [sic]. Every­thing that was re­duced from the com­mer­cial pa­per was rolled into U.S. Trea­surys.” This means that Trea­surys are now 60% of Teth­er’s re­serves, and com­mer­cial pa­per 15%. Cir­cle claims that 76% of its re­serves were in Trea­surys and 24% in cash as of May 20. For Tether or Cir­cle to suf­fer sig­nif­i­cant losses would re­quire large-scale cor­po­rate or gov­ern-ment de­faults. In such a fi­nan­cial apoc­a­lypse, sta­ble­coin pegs would be the least of our con­cerns.

In con­trast, “coupon coins” like Terra rely on de­cen­tral­ized fi­nance pro­to­cols that mint new coins when their price is above their peg and sell in­ter­est-bear­ing “coupons” when the price is be­low the peg. The logic is that in­vestors will buy coins to ac­quire the coupons, rais­ing the price back up to the peg. But once spec­u­la­tive de­mand for the coins de­clines, is­su­ing more and higher-in­ter­est coupons only has­tens the fi­nal col­lapse of their peg.

Terra launched in 2019 and got trac­tion when its cre­ator, Do Kwon, launched An­chor Pro­to­col, a plat­form that re­wards users with 18% to 20% an­nual in­ter­est on de­posits of Terra USD (UST), Ter­ra’s sta­ble­coin. These re­wards were paid out from a re­serve fund cap­i­tal­ized by Ter­ra’s par­ent com­pany.

In the end, UST and Luna (a sis­ter to­ken re­deemable for UST) ex­isted only to pro­vide ac­cess to An­chor’s in­ter­est re­wards. The more UST that was is­sued and de­posited on An­chor, the faster An­chor’s re­serve fund was de­pleted and the more ex­pen­sive it be­came for Ter­ra’s hedge-fund in­vestors to de­fend UST’s peg on var­i­ous ex­changes. Hold­ers be­gan to cash out their re­wards in late Jan­uary, threat­en­ing UST’s peg. In early May, Ter­ra’s par­ent com­pany, along with out­side in­vestors, spent bil­lions to sta­bi­lize UST’s peg, but could not suc­cess­fully restore mar­ket con­fi­dence. Just a few days later, the peg broke as in­vestors sold Luna and with­drew their UST from An­chor. In­stead of a dol­lar, UST is to­day worth just over a penny.

Crypto skep­tics will point to Terra as an­other episode of “tulip ma­nia.” They will be more cor­rect than they know. Sev­en-teenth-cen­tury Am­s­ter­dam was awash in new wealth, fu­el­ing a bub­ble in tulip-bulb prices and fu­tures. Yet, con­trary to the pop­u­lar myth, tulip ma­nia wasn’t an ex­traordinary pop­u­lar delu­sion but rather a game for a small group of wealthy mer­chants, the end of which had min­i­mal eco­nomic con­se­quences for Am­s­ter­dam. Sim­i­larly, de­spite the pain to re­tail in­vestors, Terra was a game of mu­si­cal chairs for a rel­a­tively small group of big in­vestors. The top 10 wal­lets us­ing An­chor held 27% of all UST, and the top 1,000 held 82%.

Michael Hsu, the act­ing comp­troller of the cur­rency, re­cently said of the Terra col­lapse that “there has been no con­ta­gion from cryp­tocur­ren­cies to tra­di­tional bank­ing and fi­nance.” The true les­son from Terra—as from tulip ma­nia—is that roulette games for rich spec­u­la­tors pose no sys­temic risk. Ms. Yellen should stop fret­ting about runs on sta­ble­coins. True sta­ble­coins are not wild­cat banks. The U.S. Trea­sury and Fed­eral Re­serve have bet­ter things to do—like bring­ing un­der con­trol the in­fla­tion that cur­rently threat­ens the sta­bil­ity of the dol­lar it­self.

CryptoCurrency,What feels different this cycle?,"Hey guys,

Do you all remember the buying frenzy in 2017 and how that bubble popped? Closest thing we've had since then is the pop last May. Let's recall the state of the conversation back then to reflect on now.

Back in 2018 as shit hit the fan:
- we were promised adoption...
But projects just kinda sucked back then. No one had cracked PoS yet even though big players were touting it as THE FUTURE. Cardano just felt like it was in development hell forever. IOTA was betting on robots doing everything and making microtransactions to communicate or some shit. And DeFi didn't really exist yet. Uniswap was advertising their decentralized exchange because everyone believed whales were manipulating everything and everything would be grand if we didn't need an exchange. 

That's why winter was so long back then... Ether sucked, metamask sucked, chains all pretty much sucked or didn't exist. There was no products yet, we were all just praying that somehow someone would make Ether or an ether killer not cost your first son to purchase a crypto kitty.

Now look at things. DeFi is robust. Everyone knows what lending protocols do and trusts them. Tons of legitimate decentralized exchanges, indexes, derivatives, yield aggregators, betting protocols. Multiple viable L1 and L2 chains that are basically ready to handle massive volume. If you could go back to 2018 and show us what we'd have today, winter would never have been so damn long.

So now I'm just asking myself... Where will things go from here? What will the next two years look like? Not just from a ""line goes up"" mentality, but where will the tech be soon? 

Here's a couple guesses.

-chains and phone apps will fight a beta vs vhs esque fight for standardization, hoping to become one of the select few apps accepted by most merchants. 

- credit histories will begin to manifest, changing the dynamic of lending. (Maybe more?)

-governance will actually be worked out for lots of projects.

MachineLearning,[D] Train-Valid-Test split and featurizer design,"I am working on a classification problem and encountered a problem within train-test split and feature

Suppose that I designed a featurizer function f (consider this as a fingerprint for representation learning). So f(training data) is used to train classifier, and f(test data) is fed to classifier. 

If I use 'unlabeled' data from test data to design f (such as, variance-threshold dropping of fingerprints), is this data leak? There seems to be two arguments

- Any prior knowledge on test data is data leakage and must be avoided at all cost.
- Train-test split is to simulate a situation where unknown data is given to the model. Here, it might make sense as the process is essentially (see the given unknown data but not labels (because we wouldn't have labels) -&gt; change featurizer -&gt; train classifier -&gt; use to predict new data) And my architecture is now somewhat semi-supervised learning.

Because investors took Friday’s nasty inflation shock very badly indeed. The Fed isn’t your friend, on Friday, US inflation figures once again came in higher than expected. In May, US consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 8.6%. Investors had been hoping that inflation had peaked in April; instead they got a fresh 40-year high. This is scary for markets for one main reason: it means that any hope of imminent relief from the Federal Reserve has been crushed.",finance,1655121309

CryptoCurrency,Why non-inflationary coins may shine in the bear market,"I just want to get my bias out of the way, I've been a huge fan of Nano for a long time, I don't think the last bull market was the market for digital cash, or de-inflationary and non-inflationary assets. But with that said knowing I am heavily biased..

One of the major trends we saw in the last bull market was the idea of having high inflation numbers to give stakers an even higher payout. In a bull market this actually works really well, 10% inflation or around a 15% staking reward ends up being a ton of money and does very little to actually slow the bull market. You're making money daily on staking and on the value of the asset you hold going up. This really is the best of all cases.

Now we're in a bear market. Prices are going down, people are selling non-stop, except it's even worse. You've got an additional 10% of coins now coming into existence which in most cryptocurrencies are immediately unlocked and ready to sell (contrasted with the coins that are locked and have a delay) To reach the previous all time high assuming a 3 or 4 year bear market you're looking at needing a +40% or more higher valuation in market cap.

Now there is a counter argument to this line of thinking: Well if I'm staking I'm gaining maybe around 5% or at the very least I'm breaking even. This is true to an extent, except if you factor in the downward pressure from the new coins being generated and them not costing much to generate in cash post-purchase like PoW. In PoW even though I'm not a fan the system does have two investment amounts, the hardware but then the power. Selling below power cost will never make sense.

With many coins you might expect they will stabilize in price in the bear market, but with inflation I think we will see many of these coins fall very far as the first few years of these interest rates really starts to eat at their prices.

Those are my thoughts at least, like I said in the beginning I come from being a huge Nano fan so I've probably bought into a bit of the propaganda: Instant, feeless, non-inflationary being the way to go.",cryptocurrency,1655128274

Bitcoin,"Now that bitcoin is dead (again), is it time to buy?","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-when-to-invest-bitcoin-crypto/

**Author: Ethan Lou (Special to The Globe and Mail), published 2022-06-12**

So, is bitcoin dead?

From a peak in November, 2021, of nearly US$70,000 for one unit, bitcoin’s value has been cut by more than half to about US$30,000 currently. The broader cryptocurrency market has similarly tanked.

Well, the answer to that question is that bitcoin dies often. It has fallen by 50 per cent or more at least seven other times.

Whether you like bitcoin or hate it, its fundamental qualities haven’t changed, and there’s no point in rehashing them. But in terms of price, chances are, like all the other times bitcoin died, like all the other times the stock market or oil crashed, this won’t be the last time the cryptocurrency dies – it will live again to die another day.

For the investor who believes in the fundamentals but in 2021 thought, “bitcoin is so high right now – I missed the boat,” now might be the time to revisit that idea. While this may or may not be a bottom for bitcoin prices, a lot of people sure are seeing buying opportunities.

The Canadian exchange Bitbuy tells me its data show heavy crypto buying during the recent turmoil. Usually, it’s about 50-50, but at one point in May, buy orders (not necessarily filled) on Bitbuy outstripped sell orders with a 65:35 ratio. (According to crypto price-tracking website CoinMarketCap, considered a reputable source for such numbers, total 24-hour trading volume is about $1.6-million.)

Investors have also been piling into crypto exchange-traded funds. And long-term bitcoin holders have been adding to their stacks, blockchain data show.

To be sure, this idea of buying the dip involves both going against the grain and a bit of behavioural psychology. To catch the price bottom before the rebound, you have to be buying when everyone else is full of foreboding and woe. Certainly, parts of the mainstream finance world are looking like that, amid rising interest rates and the pullback on risk assets. But, in crypto, if there are so many people still buying, then the buying-the-dip logic would imply that right now is probably not the time to enter.

Taking a wider look at the crypto markets, the answer is the same. As I’ve written before in The Globe, a good indicator of bitcoin prices is the so-called “halving,” a reduction of the rate at which new bitcoins are introduced into the system. And it’s not exactly flashing a big buy signal.

Every four years, the rate at which new bitcoins are created gets cut in half. When that happens, it’s a big blow to supply. About a year or so after each halving, bitcoin would rally to some unprecedented price and lift the wide crypto market – probably by too much, with hype overtaking fundamentals – and then prices start to fall. A year or so before the next halving, bitcoin reaches a bottom. And then the cycle repeats.

The next halving is set to happen at around March of 2024. Going by the halvings theory, that would mean that bitcoin would bottom out sometime late 2022, maybe even early 2023 – approaching, but not here yet.

The caveat to all of that: Even with all the indicators and calculations in the world, there is a lot about the markets we simply don’t know, especially for crypto, which has only been around for 13 years.

It is a good idea to keep in mind the general ideas of identifying buying opportunities and going against the grain, and the market cycles of crypto. But as with any asset, timing the market to precision, buying low and selling high, is not easy and a failed attempt often leaves retail investors badly burned.

Perhaps the answer as to whether now is a buying opportunity is to go at it more gingerly, in the way of the old dollar-cost-averaging tactic. That is, if you think bitcoin is a good buy at current prices, consider spreading out, over the next year, whatever amount you want to put into it – buying a little bit at regular intervals.

The idea would still be to try to buy low. It’s just that, instead of trying to pin the tail on the donkey at the specific point at which prices might be lowest, you’d be entering at the average price over a period during which bitcoin would likely hit its bottom – which is far safer.",cryptocurrency,1655129747

Bitcoin,Alternate view on DeFi collapse and the current situation,"Full disclosure: I've been in BTC since early 2013. Right now I have BTC split between cold storage, DeFi interest accounts, and as collateral for a $40,000 bitcoin-backed USD loan through Celsius (ouch, I know) which I used to finance mining equipment early this year. I'm not an expert by any means, but I am *extremely* long on bitcoin, and will continue to be. I am a HODLer, a speculator, and consider myself an advocate for BTC adoption. That being said:

The whole point of Bitcoin is returning now-centralized monetary policy to the decentralized hands of the people - in doing so, being your own bank. Part of being your own bank is control of lending out held assets for reasonable interest returns.

Bitcoin having that inherent utility is something that makes it viable and relevant on a world financial stage. If we can't build the trust and the viability for bitcoin to satisfy **all** **aspects** of which traditional fiat is capable, including interest-based loans, then why should the price continue to rise? Why should more people adopt it? If it doesn't have the utility, then it makes sense that the price would drop to reflect the loss in faith as a financial engine and rise in perception only as a tool for speculation and a volatile store of value.

We need to be able to face these setbacks, persevere, and try again. Participating in DeFi for me wasn't about getting rich quick. Part of it was turning held assets into a source of passive income, and the other part, about being willing to take the risk to move Bitcoin toward the mainstream by demonstrating that it has the capability to be utilized as a true financial asset. That it can do *something* other than sit in cold storage doing *nothing*. I both loaned BTC and borrowed against it. I used BTC gains to pay for a down payment on a house. How many can really say they've used BTC for meaningful change in their life?

It's safe and easy to sit back and HODL and point at the risks. *Not your keys, not your coins* is true. It's also a motto of distrust in a system that, ultimately requires some measure of trust to function as a collective resource. It's the people taking the risks, the people who buy and sell with Bitcoin, or start businesses with it, that overall both determine and demonstrate its value. Handing over BTC to borrowers is risky, and no one should loan out more than they can afford to lose, especially through a centralized intermediary. But being a pioneer isn't about sitting back and being safe 100% of the time. 

DeFi lending operations weren't ever perfect on paper, and I participated (both to lend and to borrow) full knowing the risks. I did so because I knew that it didn't just need to work in fair weather, but that someone had to be willing to winter the storms, as well if BTC is to persevere. Now I stand to take a loss (though not a ruinous one, because I never risked more than I could afford to lose), and I'm at peace with that. If the majority of this initial generation's DeFi institutions fail, it's still a learning experience. It's tools we need to make the next generation safer and more effective, hopefully with more ability to manage the lean times. And if any survive, it shows us the frameworks we need moving forward to be safer and more transparent with future iterations of DeFi.

I'll still be fine if Celsius liquidates my loan collateral to void the loan (which should happen if BTC drops to \~$14k and I don't put up additional collateral). I'll be fine if the assets I've got in DeFi lending accounts is lost. I don't need a government bailout to socialize my losses while privatizing my gains. That's what *risk* is. I've had both gains and losses. I'll continue to both mine and buy BTC. And I'll be willing to try again.

Because eventually, we have to take some risks to prove BTC can overcome these growing pains. I'm still interested in DeFi. I'm interested in using my earned assets to generate passive income via collateralized loans the same as I am in using my earned assets to generate passive income via purchasing mining equipment. If Bitcoin can't work *for* me, then it has no value to me other than its $USD conversion. If no one takes the risks, then the ecosystem and use cases don't grow. And if the use cases don't grow, why should anyone who wants to be able to *use* money, not just stash it under their mattress, buy into the idea of Bitcoin? 

Damn, this ended up being long. DMs are disabled for today.

TL:DR: This is good for Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs use cases in order to grow, and not all of those use cases will be immediately successful. Bitcoin businesses need to be able to weather lean times to prove they're worth using in the good times. And when/if they fail, we need to try again better with everything we learned. There is no growth without risk.",cryptocurrency,1655131779

Also, let's consider how the absence of a project on a scale tantamount to that of a public works project would countervail inflationary pressures; perhaps nominally. Without it we avert:

* **Inflationary pressure on wages.** A works project of this magnitude would necessitate a considerable demand for labor; with an already-tight labor market, this would raise wages which, in turn, puts inflationary pressure on all commodities.

* **Direct inflationary pressure on commodities, including crude oil.** The need for raw construction materials in a time with unprecedented supply chain issues can only, necessarily, drive prices up. Also, an ongoing project like this would put excess and continued strain on demand for fuel as well as unrefined oil. 

* **Kahn's Multiplier and increasing velocity of circulation.** With more money coursing through the economy at a sustained level, the complexity and scope of the project would conduce to far reaching and inflationary pressure throughout dissimilar industries. 

* **Lower interest rates.** As the available money supply increases due to the above point, money becomes cheaper as banks attempt to compete for loan privilege. This would directly undermine the FED, rendering one of the last policy levers remaining ineffectual.

All this considered, shutting down a massive construction project was probably a fortuitous gamble that's paying off in imperceptible ways.",finance,1655132662

stocks,Stock plunge puts S&amp;P 500 on track to enter a bear market: What investors need to know,"The S&amp;P 500 on Monday was on track to confirm what many investors have been saying for months: The large-cap benchmark is in the grips of a bear market. Stocks suffered sharp losses Monday after major benchmarks saw their worst week since January. Much of the weakness was attributed to the Friday reading of the May consumer-price index, which surged to 8.6% year-over-year — a 40-year high. Investors fear the Federal Reserve will have to raise rates even more aggressively than already expected, risking recession in their effort to tame inflation.

A close below 3,837.25 would mark a 20% pullback from the S&amp;P 500’s Jan. 3 record finish, meeting the traditional definition of a bear market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&amp;P 500 SPX, -3.14% was down 3.3% at 3,772 in recent action.

The S&amp;P 500 briefly traded below the bear-market threshold in May, but didn’t close below it. Stocks subsequently bounced, but the rebound has since given way as recession fears have increased. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.24% dropped 740 points, or 2.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, -3.86%, which slumped into a bear market earlier this year, was down 4%.

To be sure, many investors and analysts see a 20% pullback as an overly formal if not outdated metric, arguing that stocks have long been behaving in bearlike fashion. And note, that if the S&amp;P 500 were to close below the threshold, the start of the bear market would be backdated to the Jan. 3 peak. A bear market is declared over once the S&amp;P 500 has risen 20% from a low.

How have stocks behaved once a bear market has been confirmed? 

There have been 17 bear — or near-bear— markets since World War II, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in a May note. Generally speaking, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen further once a bear market begins. And, he said, bear markets have, on average, lasted about a year, producing an average peak-to-trough decline of just shy of 30%.  Beyond the averages, there’s a lot of variability in the length and depth of past bear markets. The steepest fall, a peak-to-trough decline of nearly 57%, occurred in the 17 months that marked the 17-month bear market that accompanied the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

personalfinance,Am I in a strong financial position to upgrade my home?,"I'm 30, my wife is also 30 and we make a combined HHLD income of 130k and live in a medium COL city. The current house suits our needs for now but we will likely outgrow it once we have our first child and certainly by the time we have a second (we're done after kid 2). We contribute 15% to retirement, max my HSA, and I try to max a Roth IRA every year. My wife has 30k of federal student loan debt that we will pay off vigorously if/when payments begin again. We have no other debt. 

**Current situation-** We own our 3br home with a market value of 315k and we owe 115k on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage at 2.25%. The payment on the home and average utility bills comes out to $1,321 per month which represents 15% of our take-home pay. 

**Potential future state-** Move up to a 4BR home around 400k and put our 200k equity into the new home. This would bring our total monthly fixed housing expenses (mortgage and utilities) to $2,145 which represents 25% of our take-home pay. 

My concern about doing this is to be able to afford it comfortably, I would need to move to a 20-year or even a 30-year mortgage. Also, with the market being the way it is and my need not being immediate, I'm not willing to forgo an inspection.

Just my 2 cents from my experience in market cycles. The market is ~~going to~~ shit, people are finally coming around to the idea recession and the signs have been there. I think it's important to tread lightly going forward. The fed started QT as early as June 1st (This month) and they plan on doing so for at least the rest of the year.

Their 2 main jobs are

\- Making sure unemployment is low

\- Moderating inflation

&amp;#x200B;

Notice how they dont mention how the stock market is doing. They have literally told you, we are taking out liquidity from the markets, and its only been 2 weeks. we still have half a year of this to go atleast.  What scares me truly is how the fed is so Dovish and how we have almost no history of QT you mix those 2 cocktails together it becomes, for lack of a better word. A clusterfuck

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Until the fed stops QT the only logical conclusion is to DCA a bearish ETF (I like PSQ 1x QQQ Bear) or short the markets weekly. Just like QE threw valuations outta the window to save the economy, QT will do the literal opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

CryptoCurrency,HODL and compound interest,"In bear market, one of the best strategies is hodling and staking your coins to earn more coins.

You might ask how long would it take to double the amount of your coins since that's something we all want, am I right?

Let me introduce the \*\*Rule of 72\*\* to you then. According to that rule, to get an approximate time it'll take to double your investment is to divide 72 by the annual interest rate.

Now some examples to see it more clearly:

If your interest rate is 5 percents, it will take 15 years to double your coins.

With 8 percents, it would take app. 9 years.

Do you want to be faster and double your coins in 5 years? The rate should be then 14.4 percents.

Should you use compound interest on your coins? Definitely! Should you expect to double your $100, $1000 or $10000 in few months just from compound? Definitely not.",cryptocurrency,1655139744

stocks,"The S&amp;P 500 is now in an official bear market, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices","It’s official, according to the folks who decide which markets are bulls and which are bears, not to mention which stocks go into the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500.

U.S. stocks on Monday entered a bear market because the S&amp;P 500 closed more than 21% below its all-time record close reached as recently as last January, S&amp;P Global Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote. 

Stocks had been flirting with a bear market for the past several weeks on an intraday basis, but had never actually closed below 3837, the level S&amp;P Global needed to see in order to officially declare one. 

S&amp;P Global says a 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500 on a closing basis from its previous peak is all it takes to define a bear market. Which means that this bear market is already more than five months old, since the S&amp;P 500 all-time high came on January 3.

Since the modern S&amp;P 500 index began in the late 1920s, the average bear market has translated into a 38% price decline lasting an average of almost 19 months. 

But that’s only the average. The longest bear market lasted 62 months, between 1937 and 1946, while the worst decline came as the Great Depression got underway and stocks plunged 86%.

The causes of every bear market are different, of course. This one is defined by the Fed tightening interest rates in reply to galloping inflation that’s running at the fastest clip in 40 years, and the first European land war since World War 2.

The last bear market in early 2020 was caused by the onset of Covid-19, a global pandemic, and the economic contraction that followed. The Global Financial Crisis created the 2007-2009 bear market as the housing market imploded. The bursting of the Tech Bubble led directly to the 2000-2002 bear market.

So, how does S&amp;P Global define the end of a bear market? When the index reaches its low and later rises by 20%. Unfortunately for investors, that can only be known in hindsight.

What will you miss out on if you just wait for the printer to turn back on?  Does anybody even care about actual price discovery based on fundamentals?  Do the people handling your 401 realize this?  

Because if the prices actually reflected sentiment anchored to fundamentals, alot of companies like XOM should not be having diaper filling days like this.

It seems that you can basically disregard this reality at your own risk.  You can DCA all day and night into SPY but all it appears to be is your tax money and printed vapor being handed back to you.  And it's pointless to look at historic levels.  It's now obvious that the GFC and the following decade plus was likely mostly if not all vapor.  The valuations have stagnated in situations or dropped entirely when they actually have to compete with Bonds (that are still negative at this point.)

It's crazy considering how big some companies are and how much they provide.  It's beyond just dismissing it all as ""the market is not rational"". That is fine, I accept that.  But this isn't just about the market's ability to be rational.

This is about the global economy as a whole and what wealth really is.  Are securities even assets if the companies they represent are just conduits for fake money to the ""investors?""

Does debt matter when entire manufacturing and resource bases were exported and there is no will to reinvigorate them?  Does being green matter if you can't provide heat and electricity in the winter?  And you arrest people when they start burning their cash and the trees around their houses to provide heat because there is no gas?  And on that same vein, does it matter if you want to go green but you have no desire to look for and provide the resources needed to do so out of your own natural resource reserves?

I am not looking to argue or anything.  I am just sitting here philosophizing watching all but my dinky little EUO and UUP trades go red which ironically are green due to a dollar that now requires six of itself to buy a dozen eggs being stronger than any other asset on Earth despite no tangible backing beyond an inept government and a giant military.

Would a theory that time in the market is bad unless the Fed is printing work historically over the past decade?  Because the last few times rates have been attempted to be raised this is what happens.  And now there's commodity shortages exacerbating the price of normal QoL.  Where we already see some absolutely ridiculous policy starting: The Bank of England is raising rates while SIMULTANEOUSLY handing out money via vouchers.  

I am not an economist but I did take micro and macro in college in the early '00s and the more I see actions like this and ""at all costs"" mentality the more I am confused by how there is no accepted policy anymore.  It's just knee-jerk and rampant idiocy that runs directly contrary to even the most basic economics taught.",finance,1655152198
CryptoCurrency,Is this the failure of Keynesian economics?,"As we observed, FED has tightened quickly this year, but inflation still shoot into new height. 

Normally we would anticipate lower price level when the demand is shrank by reducing money supply. However, this time the price of everything rises not because of increased money supply, but decreased production capacity due to structural problems all over the planet

To bring down the demand for those basic utility goods, they would need to essentially impoverish the whole working class to achieve that, that is a destructive move if ever considered

So it seems they have no way to control inflation this time by just reduce money supply, Keynesian economics can only do so much. They will realise it sooner or later, and then adjust their inflation target up, at earliest the end of the year",cryptocurrency,1655152610

personalfinance,How best to direct profits from home sale toward debts?,"My family and I recently relocated to an exurban region of a Southern state for new job opportunities and to be closer to family. Our home went under contract in just a few days, the buyers have indicated that they are satisfied with their inspection, an appraisal has been scheduled, and it appears that we will be headed to a successful closing in early July.

Assuming nothing goes wrong, we are looking at a net profit of around $95,000 on this home sale. We are renting a home in our new location for $1,600 per month and have no interest in buying a home until next spring at the earliest (and that's only IF the market becomes a little more reasonable). That said, we do want to eventually own our own home, and may need to spend upwards of $400,000 to do so (with a mortgage, of course). 

Our household income at the moment is around $131,000; this will go up to around $136,000 later this year, and then up by about 3% annually after that. 

We are a family of four -- me, my spouse, and two kids, aged 7 and 4. It looks like we'll be paying about $1,100 per month for our 4-year-old's pre-K; we're not sure yet about after-school care for the 7-year-old, but it'll probably run us about $300 per month.

We were a single-income family for most of the past decade. As a result, we have accumulated quite a bit of debt that we have shifted around in various ways in order to maximize take-home pay. We haven't been frivolous with our money, but we did utilize a lot of credit trying to get by while my wife was a stay-at-home mom, and the profits from our home sale can help us get a clean start.

Our major debts include:

\- A $32,000 debt consolidation loan through our credit union. Interest rate is around 11%; we make a monthly payment of $825.

\- A credit-card balance of approximately $20,000, at an interest rate of 10%; we currently make a minimum payment of around $325 on this card, plus whatever else we have available at the end of the month.

\- Another credit-card balance of $14,000, at a soon-to-expire introductory rate of 0%. We currently make a monthly minimum payment of $140 on this card. 

\- A 0% APR auto loan of around $23,000, with a monthly payment of $500. 

If you do the math, you will see that we can use the profits from the home sale to wipe the slate clean on our revolving debt and debt consolidation loan AND pay off the car entirely. That allows us to take about $1,800 a month in take home pay that would normally be going towards monthly debt payments and redirect it towards savings and other expenses. (We've already committed to not using credit cards after this.) 

At the same time, we do feel a knawing, nebulous need to save around $10,000 or so from our sale, either to establish an emergency fund or to seed an eventual down payment on a home down the line. If we do that, we will have to choose which existing debt won't be paid down in full -- I assume the best choice is to pay off everything but the car, since the car loan has a 0% interest rate.

So that's my first question -- pay off the 0% loan, have maybe $5,000 left from our home sale, and begin saving money from our paychecks after that, or save a larger amount from the home sale, pay down some (but not all) of the auto loan, and save a smaller amount of money from our monthly take-home pay? Does it make a difference?

And more to the point: Are we not thinking through our plan to pay off the bigger loans and card balances? These strike me as ""bad debts"" -- two large credit-card balances and one consolidation loan with a double-digit interest rate -- but I suppose someone might make a suggestion of another way to use the money from the home sale. I'm all ears!",finance,1655156047

personalfinance,Update: My H&amp;R Block Tax Pro Ghosted Me....and still hasn't filed my taxes,"Hi all,

I posted about a month ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ujpc0e/my\_hr\_block\_tax\_pro\_ghosted\_me\_can\_i\_dispute\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ujpc0e/my_hr_block_tax_pro_ghosted_me_can_i_dispute_the/)) about my H&amp;R block tax pro not responding to messages about tax paperwork after filling out our return incorrectly and having an additional $70 added to the tax preparation fee (after we had already paid $215 on April 15) for no reason.

Well after posting that, I finally got through customer service after the line being cut multiple times and did a ""client escalation"". The district manager reached out to me a few days after that to resolve the issue and offered me a $50 refund. I insisted we would not pay a single dime over the $215 we had already paid and after some back and forth, they removed the charge. We finally got all our taxes done properly, approved them and sent them back to be filed (on my husband's account). We (extremely stupidly, I take full responsibility for not checking on this myself) assumed that this would be the end of it around May 15, and we would hear back from the IRS about our federal refund and from our state about paying what we owed. (editing to add: we have never owed taxes before, so \*stupidly\* assumed that they would be paid after the return was received, not at the time of filing)

Yesterday, I thought about the fact that I still hadn't heard anything back from the IRS. I checked husband's account again and noticed that only the federal taxes had been e-filed, and state taxes had not been filed at all. I also checked the IRS refund status.... they have no record of our taxes. While we are getting a federal refund, we owe to the state, so this sucks, and we will now have to pay 2 months worth of penalties (I think).

I emailed the district manager again and haven't heard back yet from him or our original tax preparer. However, I just got notification on my husband's phone that an in-person appointment was set up for us on Thursday with a different tax preparer and saw that our taxes are being ""prepared"" again on their online portal.... absolutely 0 contact outside of this, no checking to see if we were available on that date and time (we're not). I am SO done.

**TLDR;** Using H&amp;R block, our first return was incorrect and we got a refund on a bogus fee they tried to charge after correcting the paperwork. Even after client escalation and getting in contact with the district manager, our taxes have not been filed even though we dropped off all our paperwork in mid-March and approved our final return in mid-May. This has been a 3 month long shit-show.

Two questions and one comment:

1. Is there anyone above the district manager I can escalate this to?
2. At this point, how much of a refund would be reasonable to ask for?
3. I have 10000% learned my lesson and will not be using H&amp;R block ever again, nor will I ever fully trust someone to finish a job I've contracted out to them without checking that all the steps have been approved and completed myself.",finance,1655158391

economy,2008 financial crisis,"I just want to make sure I have a good understanding of the issue. So in 1977, the community reinvestment act was passed which imposed that banks would be more liberal with their handing out of loans. In the 1990s and early 2000's, this began to be actually enforced by HUD to further economic equality for americans of all incomes, resulting in requirements and standards being lowered on who qualifies for loans. Loans with initially low interest rates were given to individuals who were very likely to be unable to pay them off in the future. The demand in houses was inflated by the higher supply of ""cheap"" loans to ""afford"" homes, and as a result the average price of a house increased. Banks started to sell security based mortgage investments to investors (a collection of 1000's of mortgages), who would gain profit from the interest rates. However not surprisingly, subprime homeowners began to foreclose unable to pay. As a result to make up for losses, banks started to increase interest rates which only furthered foreclosures. The investors of the security based mortgages were spooked and pulled out. In a short period of time many homes went empty, which increased tbe supply of homes which in turn dropped the value of homes immediately. Many individuals were left with loans that now exceeded the value of their homes. Banks were left overextended with loans that were unable to be paid of and stopped giving out all loans, Americans were left with debt unable to afford other basic necessities. As a result of all this the economy went into a recession, with a grinding hault to investments. Did I miss anything? I'm studying economics by myself at the moment.

economy,Powell has said his strategy for tackling inflation will involve “some pain” ....spiraling wages going down,"“It’s not that these firms didn’t have the money to pay their workers better while inflation soared. As the report points out, of those 106 firms where median worker pay didn’t keep up with inflation, sixty-seven spent a collective $43.7 billion on stock buybacks to pump up their CEOs’ stock-based paychecks. According to the report, 

                    Lowe’s, Target, and Best Buy, for instance, could’ve given all of their employees a raise of $40,000, $16,000, and $32,270 each 
                    respectively, if they had spent the billions they blew on stock buybacks on their workforce instead.

The report’s findings come amid a national debate over inflation that has consistently stressed the impact of higher worker wages and government policies that put money into average people’s pockets. Meanwhile, the idea that corporate price gouging has played some role has been cast by some as a “conspiracy theory.”

Powell has said his strategy for tackling inflation will involve “some pain” and declared in a May press conference that outlined his belief in the need to stifle wage growth that “we can’t allow a wage-price spiral to happen.” An imbalance in supply and demand for the job market means “wages are running at the highest level in many decades,” he explained, and the Fed’s policies would enable “further healing in the labor market” to bring them “back into balance.”  The “healing” Powell is euphemistically referring to in reality means the erasure of job opportunities, which will erode workers’ bargaining power and make them more willing to take on jobs with substandard working conditions, including low pay.”

Please specify your risk tolerance in your answers.

Income: 98k/year ($8167/month). Working mostly remotely.

Age: 29. Trying to build my wealth.

Accounts:

* **46k** in high-yield checking (20k at 4% APY and 26k at 1.25% APY). Additional money will be subject to 1.25% APY.
* **11.5k** in Roth IRA (already maxed out this year)
* **1.6k** in HSA. Will max out to $3650 this year
* Just started contributing $2930/month (after taxes) to work-sponsored Roth 401k this week; allocation set to max out the full $20,500 this year
* No taxable accounts

Debt:

* **5k** in federal student loans

Near term needs:

* Place to live. I am currently living with (and helping) family in a small town at no monetary cost, with no pressure to move out. But would like to move somewhere more lucrative when it makes sense.

Expenses:

* Very little currently; around $500/month. However I'm not currently paying for housing or groceries, which will change when I move.

Credit score: 730-805, depending on whom you ask

Some things I'm considering (but fully open to other ideas):

* Real estate / House-hacking: buying a house/duplex and renting out rooms/units. Really like the idea of getting into real estate investing but I'm anxious about starting in the current market.
* Taxable account index funds: given that stocks are dropping, seems like a good time to buy more and hold. Since my Roth IRA is maxed and and 401k will max out at the current allocation, I figured I could put some money in taxable investments as well.
* Continue to hold and accumulate money in my high-yield checking and wait for better opportunities to arise, particularly in the housing market

I know Fed is not stupid. Even a decent economy 101 student will tell you that printing money will lead to inflation.

Total compensation: 377k (minimum) per year gross

Bills and debt: We pay 3.4k in rent now, alongside our other budgeted costs which are unlikely to change (gas, food, utilities etc.) and an expected student loan payment of 1.2k per month once that restarts (our only debt).

Altogether, on top of our expenses, we save 5k a month entirely for our housing fund. The mortgage on our new house, with utilities and insurance, would be \~5.5k. Because we'd no longer be paying our current rent, we'd feel very comfortable with that monthly spend.

We also max our our 401ks, HSAs, and before we hit the income threshold — one of us was maxing our Roths. We keep emergency funds of around 65k, and have a separate investment account worth around 275k. We would like to preserve all of this saving moving forward.

My question is — this family loan would be for 100k, allowing us to buy a house ASAP. But the terms seem a little worrisome to me. First, the loan would need to be repaid in five years, which seems very aggressive (\~2k a month considering interest). Second, the interest rate would be lower than the rate a bank would give us for a personal loan — but not by much, maybe 5% interest?

We also have our wedding coming up, which will cost \~20k, so that's important to note. 

**Is it better for us to take this loan now, and buy a house we've been interested in — or wait a year and continue to save?** Realistically, if we scrimped, we could save the 100k in \~ 15 months in our current situation, but we're nervous about a potential rise in rates between now and then.

personalfinance,Should I sell my house and rent for a while to figure my life out?,"I’m in my early 30s and have been in my house for 4.5 years now. It has since gone up quite a bit, worth about $280K and I owe $150K. 

Over the past 2-3 years, I irresponsibly racked up $12K in credit card debt and still have $9K in student loans. 

This year though I really came to my senses and have been able to set aside almost half of my $4K take-home pay each month to pay off my credit card debt. I’ve been hardcore budgeting, cutting expenses, and honestly loving the process. 

I now owe $8K in CC debt and know exactly where my money is going. My goal is to be debt-free in a year. 

However, this house is 100 years old and it seems like every month there’s a new costly repair. Two months ago, it was a rotting porch column, the next month the porch roof, then new gutters, and now I find out that the cast iron pipes underground need to be replaced soon, which is going to be very expensive. 

I’m just now getting on top of things financially but right now I’m feeling underwater with the house and selling it could be a fresh start for me to get ahead in my finances. 

On top of all that, my ex-girlfriend who lived with me here for three years moved out in January after our break up. I almost sold right after she moved but I wanted to give myself time to adjust. There are a lot of memories here and sometimes I feel like I want a new beginning. 

Some days I feel good about the house - making it my own, but other days I’m just overwhelmed and stressed about what I need to fix next. There’s also a third bedroom I don’t use and I almost never use the dining room. All I really need is a bedroom and an office.

I have a high interest rate of 5.5% and wasn’t keen enough to refinance. 

My credit is good, 757. 

My mortgage with escrow is $1213 a month. Utilities including water, sewer, trash, gas, electric, internet, security (got robbed my second year here), etc average $300ish. 

I make $70K at my job and have also taken on side jobs doing brand and website design for small businesses, making about $5-7K extra a year.

I have $3K in an HSA, $26K in my IRA, and $1.5K in an emergency fund. 

No car payment but my car is reaching its end. 

I’m thinking I could rent a 2br for a similar price to my mortgage, especially if utilities are included. This way I’d have everything I need without the extra unused rooms and I’d be closer to the city and my friends. 

I’d also be in a better spot financially if I come away with $90-100K profit. I’d have the ability to save for a future down payment, build an emergency fund, and be totally debt free. 

I don’t really want to rent it out because I don’t want to be a landlord, I’d still be on the hook for upcoming repairs, and my mortgage is kinda high. 

Is it a bad idea to try to sell right now? I’ve been mulling over this decision for a long time now and want to make the best one, both emotionally and financially. 

Would love any advice and if I’m overlooking any important factors.

investing,Fed Likely to Consider 0.75-Percentage-Point Rate Rise This Week,"*Officials had signaled plans to raise interest rates in half-point increments before recent deterioration in data*

Nick Timiraos

&gt; A string of [troubling inflation reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-economy-federal-reserve-11655134682?mod=article_inline) in recent days is likely to lead Federal Reserve officials to consider surprising markets with a larger-than-expected 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase at their meeting this week.
&gt; 
&gt; Before officials began their premeeting quiet period on June 4, they had signaled they were prepared to raise interest rates by a half percentage point this week and again at their meeting in July. But they also had said their outlook depended on the economy evolving as they expected. [Last week’s inflation report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-may-2022-11654810079?mod=article_inline) from the Labor Department showed a bigger jump in prices in May than officials had anticipated.
&gt; 
&gt; Two consumer surveys have also shown households’ expectations of future inflation have increased in recent days. That data could alarm Fed officials because they believe such expectations can be self-fulfilling.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point at [its meeting last month](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-approves-half-point-interest-rate-rise-ratcheting-up-its-inflation-fight-11651687201?mod=article_inline), the first such increase since 2000, to a range between 0.75% and 1%. The Fed last raised rates by 0.75 percentage point at a meeting in 1994, when the central bank was rapidly raising rates to pre-empt a potential rise in inflation.
&gt; 
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has avoided surprising markets on the day of policy meetings, instead arguing that the central bank can achieve its goals of tightening policy by shaping market expectations.
&gt; 
&gt; But he also said in an interview last month that the Fed would be guided by the economic data to come. “What we need to see is clear and convincing evidence that inflation pressures are abating and inflation is coming down. And if we don’t see that, then we’ll have to consider moving more aggressively,” Mr. Powell said.
&gt; 
&gt; At [a news conference](https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-fed-chief-powells-postmeeting-press-conference-11651696613?mod=article_inline) last month, Mr. Powell said the central bank would “strive to avoid adding uncertainty” but also acknowledged the possibility of “further surprises” in the inflation data. “We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The Labor Department reported Friday that its consumer-price index rose 8.6% in May from the same month a year earlier, pushing inflation to a 40-year high. That was a setback for forecasters who were looking for signs that inflation had peaked in March. Rising fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions from Russia’s war against Ukraine have sent prices up in recent months.
&gt; 
&gt; A handful of Wall Street forecasters, including at investment banks Barclays and Jefferies, said Friday, after the inflation data were released, that they expected the Fed to raise rates by 0.75 percentage point this week.
&gt; 
&gt; “We believe that risk-management considerations call for aggressive action to reinforce the Fed’s inflation-fighting credibility,” Barclays economists wrote in a subsequent report Monday. While such a move “would go against communications leading into the blackout period,” the report said “risks of prolonged inflation have intensified,” justifying the larger rate rise.
&gt; 
&gt; After the publication of this article on Monday afternoon, other forecasters, including at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said they expected a 0.75-percentage-point rate rise this week.
&gt; 
&gt; On Friday, a University of Michigan survey of consumers’ long-term inflation expectations rose to its highest level since 2008. On Monday, the New York Fed reported that its survey showed consumers’ short-term inflation expectations had jumped and that the distribution of households’ longer-term expectations was more varied than in the past, suggesting more households might be expecting higher inflation to stay, even though the median didn’t rise.
&gt; 
&gt; Fed officials have said they would want to respond aggressively to signs that inflation expectations were rising, or becoming “de-anchored,” because they believe the process of wringing inflation from the economy will become far more difficult if that has happened.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s a one-two punch,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They’ve got to go now with 75. The Fed is behind the curve, and they know it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Bond yields, which surged Friday amid a broad market selloff, continued to climb as [that rout deepened on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-fears-send-u-s-bond-yields-surging-ahead-of-fed-meeting-11655135691?mod=article_inline). Investors in interest-rate futures markets placed a nearly 30% probability on the larger 0.75-percentage-point increase on Monday afternoon, up from around 4% before last Friday’s inflation reports, according to CME Group. After publication of this article, those market-implied probabilities rose above 90%.
&gt; Consumers’ inflation expectations for both the short and long term are on the upswing, according to surveys.
&gt; 
&gt; Officials will have to weigh several considerations at their two-day meeting that begins on Tuesday. They could stick with their current strategy of raising rates in half-percentage-point increments indefinitely until they see signs that inflation is conclusively downshifting.
&gt; 
&gt; Such a path of rate rises would lift the Fed’s overnight benchmark rate to a range between 2.25% and 2.5% by September, and to a range between 3.25% and 3.5% by December. This would represent the most aggressive interval of policy tightening since the 1980s.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, Mr. Powell and his colleagues could signal a rising likelihood of shifting to larger rate rises at the Fed’s meeting in late July.
&gt; 
&gt; But if officials anticipate a significant likelihood of such an increase at the July 26-27 meeting, they could decide to move more aggressively this week.
&gt; 
&gt; Ms. Swonk said she expected officials to make such an argument at this week’s meeting. “The data now is not good. The data is saying they have to do more,” said Ms. Swonk. “We’re moving into a more inflation-prone world, and they know that, and if they don’t derail it now, this could be incredibly corrosive.”
&gt; 
&gt; Already, borrowing costs set by markets have climbed faster than the Fed’s benchmark rate in anticipation of its policy moves. Mortgage lenders on Monday said they were beginning to quote a 30-year fixed loan with rates above 6%, levels that haven’t been reached since 2008.
&gt; 
&gt; Other analysts said Monday afternoon that a larger 0.75-point rate jump would cause more problems for the central bank than it would solve by confusing investors about how the Fed reacts to new data.
&gt; 
&gt; “It just opens up additional communication challenges thereafter,” said Neil Dutta, an economist at research firm Renaissance Macro. “It suggests the Fed is losing confidence in its forecast. We all know they were trying to catch up, but now it looks like they are panicking.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Dutta said he also worried that a supersize rate increase would make it harder for the central bank to avoid a recession. “It suggests the Fed is willing to push the economy into a ‘hard-landing’-like scenario to get inflation under control,” he said.

economy,ELI5 - How is raising rates going to kill inflation in an economy that is seeing higher prices for reasons unrelated to demand,"Ok, I'm not an expert in economics. That's why I come to you, oh holders of the economics wisdom stones, for answers. They didn't like this question elsewhere, so I turn to you in my hour of need.

Now, I *do* understand that in a hot hot economy you need to raise rates so that people stop borrowing and spending (and thus producers of goods don't have to raise prices to increase production capacity to meet demand).  However, correct me if I'm wrong, but... the problem this time isn't over-consumption. In fact, the run-away inflation is leading to less consumption because average people can't afford the fucking insane cost of living already. 

Now, ELI5 if I am wrong, because it seems to me that the real problem is several fold: 1) the Fed handed out money like candy via QE after the government printed paper dollars, and that is finally biting everyone in the ass like it normally would... too much money supply and none of it has purchasing power.  To that degree, rates should rise. However, that in and of itself won't cause a recession nor kill inflation. The recession is all about lack of average person purchasing power and low wages creating labor market fuckups which slow economic activity in general.  

So, real the problem is seems to me:  2) Corporate greed. After all, no one forces them to raise prices on shit, the executives are just taking home more pay. They could cut their bloated salaries and not raises prices at all. Whatever supply chain issues could be handled without raising prices if they knew how to manage shit.  I mean, look at the Swiss Army Knife company-- never had layoffs in centuries because they didn't have greedhead dingbats running the company for short terms profits and their own narrow personal interests.  

3) Supply-chain issues due to covid. The excuse for them to raises prices is that they can't buy the stuff they need to make their products unless they pay more for their raw materials. (Sure as shit its not because their labor costs went up much). Meanwhile, the raw material providers say they can't supply not because demand is high but because disruptions in their own chains.  So... raising rates aint gonna do shit to untangle supply chains.  The solution to supply chain issues is-- get your management act together and plan for the future while taking a short term hit to your corporate profits and C-suite salaries, dumbasses.

4) The real problem is corporate mismanagement-- they thought they could get all lean and have little inventory of raw materials and such and ""just in time"" supply chains (to again feed their greed since they never passed this productivity or efficiency on to their workers' salaries) but now they find their supply chains snarled and inefficient. Good job fuckwads.

So.. if you want to kill inflation, ELI5 how I am wrong, because it seems to me the solution is not raise rates (which won't impact demand since demand is lackluster) but to 

A)  fucking restrict the greed of the corporate dingbats who fucked up running their businesses and now want to again punish the average worker for it. 

And B) Raise the minumum wage and inflation problems become ... no problem for everyone since they can afford the cost of living.  

C) tax the wealthy and lower taxes for everyone else, and then use that money to provide services for the middle and lower classes like single payer healthcare, etc   

D) penalize coroprate greed and corporate government capture and corporate monopolistic behavior.  

Plus, E) reduce the money supply and reduce the government debt in general, strengthening the dollar.   

Basically-- unwind all the fuckups of the Trump corporate greed era.  Right?  ELI5 how I am wrong about this.

We see it everytime-- Republicans get in office and the markets inflate/go up reflexively since they all have herd mentality and assume that there will be an easy money pro business regime. Then, it all fucks everything up and Dems have to come in and fix it with actual fiscal intelligence.  

So, here we are again. The solution: end the robber baron trump era and fix all his stupidity and you fix the inflation problem too.  And, of course, never vote Republican again. 

There, America... I just solved your fuckup economy.  But raising rates? Dafuk that gonna do when demand and lending aren't the problem?  Now, I may be wrong about some of this, so ELI5 why this won't work and raising rates will be the magic bullet.",finance,1655189040

In case of DCA I buy every week/biweekly/month all the way down and up. The advantage being you take emotion out of it and you can't miss the bottom. Disadvantage: you leave possible gains on the table with the shares you bought more expensive on the way down/up.

In case of don't fight the FED you wait till the FED's start cutting interest rates and you lump sump everything at once. Advantage: Possibly more gains because you bought everything closer to the bottom. Disadvantage: you might miss the bottom plus it takes a lot of balls to lump sump a significant part of you life savings (while keeping an emergency fund) all at once.

On top of that it took them months to approve a new hire on my team so i am picking up the slack for my team while they are understaffed. They did approve the new hire but the specialty nature of our work means lead times for candidates is typically aeveral months.

The work is still manageable, but I am getting pretty stressed out.

On top of that, I just learned that someone with far less experience than me is making significantly more than me. Like almost $30k. What's even more frustrating is that he left the company last year making around $100k, determined he didn't like his new job, came back and demanded $175k and they gave it to him.

So here I am, having been loyal, weathered the storm of the great resignation, shit on every time I ask for more people or help, and making a lot less money because of it.

If the economy were in a better spot, I wouldn't hesitate, but I just can't stand thr thought of being unemployed long enough to lose my house or something like that.

So should I stay for comfort and security? Leave for more money and sanity?

Edit: To clarify, my fear is that I leave for a new job, get laid off during the recession, and can't go back to my current job. I would not leave my current job without a new one lined up.",finance,1655206626

stocks,Markets brace for 100-point Fed rate hike as inflation roars to new high,"Just yesterday the WSJ was pushing the 75-basis point hike...Bloomberg was still hedging that way this AM....now this article from end of day yesterday pushing for 100. 

[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/markets-brace-for-100-point-fed-rate-hike-as-inflation-roars-to-new-high/ar-AAYpFho)

Some Wall Street traders are betting that the Federal Reserve will take the most aggressive step in decades as it races to catch up with scorching-hot inflation.

The dismal report prompted some banks, including Barclays and Jeffries, to revise their expectations for the Fed meeting this week, which concludes on Wednesday. The strategists now expect central bankers to approve a 75-basis point hike as they try to project confidence to the markets.

""The U.S. central bank now has good reason to surprise markets by hiking more aggressively than expected in June,"" the Barclays strategists wrote in a note Friday. ""We realize it is a close call and that it could play out in either June or July. But we are changing our forecast to call for a 75-basis point hike on June 15."" 

Policymakers have not lifted the short-term interest rate by 75-basis points since 1994, and have not approved a 100-basis point increase since Paul Volcker led the central bank and ran an aggressive inflation-crushing campaign in the early 1980s.",finance,1655208281
CryptoCurrency,"Why are so many of you people ""HODLing nomatter what""?","I cannot understand the ""any selling is weak hands"" argument.  Why not spend a little more time paying attention to the economy in the short-term, so you can make proactive decisions about your investments? 

Here's a bit of reality for all you genius apes.  

The fed meeting is tomorrow and its going to be a .75 basis point hike.  First time since 1994.  Some of this is already baked into markets (I'm assuming you've realized by now that your stocks are down almost 10% and crypto is down 30% since Friday), but there is always more room to drop and more pain to come. 

A lot more.  

When JP pulls a switcheroo from .5 to .75 a mere 36 hours before the Fed meeting, you had better bed your ass that he'll open up the doors for more hikes at .75.  And he should.  A CPI at 8.6 is bonkers with a base funds rate of 1.5%.  It's borderline economic catastrophe.  Since the invention of the dollar, rate hikes have only successfully brought down inflation once they got within 2.5% of the inflation rate.  Get your calculator out bc that means if the inflation rate were to stay at 8.7 (yea right) it would take 6 more rate hikes to get us in the functional range. When he says that ""we are now considering .75 rate hikes in July and September, possibly higher"" you had better believe people are going to trade whatever they can for cold hard cash.  

And that's not all.  

You've probably heard of Quantitative ""Easing"".  That's how the Fed ""prints"" money into existence. They create the money on a magic computer and use it to purchase treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (those bundles of mortgages you heard Christian Bale and Steve Carrell talking so much about in The Big Short).  The Fed bought 3 boatloads of this stuff in 2008 (these purchases are referred to as the ""bailouts""), and up to now they've got about $8,500,000,000,000 worth.  That's trillion, with a T. 

Now we get to play a new game.  Quantitative ""Tightening"".  

Starting tomorrow (Wednesday for anyone late to the party), the Fed will sell $45,000,000,000 in assets onto the open market.  That's going to be a whole lot of pressure on markets to stay up and we all know people aren't exactly buying-hand-over-fist right now.  Their purpose is to bring markets down.  That, by definition, is fighting inflation.  Remember: price up = bad.  Price down = good.  

But the QT fun doesn't end there.  The Fed is going to sell another $45 billion in assets in July, and another $45B in August.  Then, they will increase the rate to $95 BILLION EVERY MONTH starting in September.  At that rate of monthly selling they won't run out of MBS for 7.5  years.  

Let's talk about those mortgage-backed securities for a second. Those bundles of thousands of mortgages we call MBS start out when you buy a house. Or when your cousin buys a condo to rent on Airbnb.  Remember when you finally closed on your house and 2 days later you received a letter saying that your loan was purchased by another lender?  ""Underwriting"" is your lender making sure there is a buyer ready and willing to buy this loan the moment you close on the property.  That's why you get the notice right away.  As you were figuring out to whom you should make your mortgage payment that new lender was bundling your loan with many others to sell yet again to a bigger bank.  The bundle grows each time and at some point they refer to them as MBS, and for some reason they are considered much more secure than individual mortgages.  They are given ratings like A, BB, CCC, etc.  Picture Ryan Gosling playing jenga.  Now when the biggest MBS customer not only stops buying but starts dumping MBS onto the market, you can imagine the demand for these bundles of joy will shift.  Soon smaller banks can't sell to bigger banks as easily as before. And eventually not at all.  This past Friday the market for MBS actually hit ""zero bids"" for the first time since 2008 (you might have seen a tweet from the actual Michael Burry).  As loans become harder to sell, will also become harder to write.  And we know what that will do to the housing market.  Remember: price down = good.  

Now you're getting it.  

Lastly, because my legs are asleep, you need to understand that most of the money that came into crypto since 2017 was not from people here on reddit.  Many of them do not share your diamond hands conviction, and their crypto investment doesn't represent an ""inflation hedge"".  It represents the riskiest thing they've ever done with their money.  Ever. Big risk = big reward.  And when both the stock market and the housing market get tumultuous, risk assest get sold first.  That is what you are starting to see. An almost perfect correlation between crypto and the Nasdaq, just where the swings in crypto gains and losses are exaggerated. 

Unfortunately we are probably one or two cycles away from certain cryptos being seen and used like the scarce resource inflation hedge that they really are.  

So here you are, with all this new knowledge and a bag of Shitcoin Potpourri.  And there is a train coming tomorrow that will last until at least through September.  

Good luck!",cryptocurrency,1655208290
personalfinance,Financial conundrum on my personal future,"Hi all,

I need some guidance.

It all went bad when I lost my job at a large company and was struggling for employment for more than a year. In that year I had to max out 3 credit cards, an overdraft facility, and my pension as the main breadwinner in my household of 4 people.

This broke me. In 2020, just before the pandemic, I found new employment but it is commission based and the income fluctuates as it is seasonal and covid made employment in my target market very unstable.

I thought it would become better now but it did not. I found myself having to travel extensively and our 2 vehicles are very old with mileage above 360 000 on the clock.

I am unable to buy a new vehicle due to my credit cards, loan, and an overdraft. 

Now I came from some inheritance and want to make the right decisions. It is only enough to cover my credit cards and overdraft debt, nothing more, and then only can I look for a better medical aid plan.

What should I do? Rather continue to pay my debt monthly at high-interest rates and use the inheritance to buy a new vehicle?

What about my retirement?

What about my medical aid?",finance,1655208493

stocks,(6/14) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, June the 14th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street looks to bounce from Monday sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday, as the market tried to claw back some of Monday’s steep declines that pushed the S&amp;P 500 back into bear market territory. Traders also looked ahead to a key monetary policy announcement from the Federal Reserve later in the week.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 70 points, or 0.24%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.36% and 0.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Shares of Oracle jumped 12% in premarket trading after the software company reported an earnings beat boosted by a “major increase in demand” in its infrastructure cloud business.
*****
&gt; The moves came after an intense sell-off Monday. The S&amp;P 500 slumped 3.9% to its lowest level since March 2021, closing more than 21% below its January record. Monday’s close marked bear market for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2020. During that last bear market, the S&amp;P 500 lost 33.9% before recovering, according to data compiled by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The data also showed that bear markets on average last more than 18 months.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the Dow tumbled 2.8%, putting it roughly 17% off its record high. The Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 4.7% and is now more than 33% off its November record.
*****
&gt; Those losses came as expectations grow for the Fed to hike rates more than initially anticipated. CNBC’s Steve Liesman reported Monday that the Fed will “likely” consider a 75-basis-point increase, which is greater than the 50-basis-point hike many traders had come to expect. The Wall Street Journal reported the story first.
*****
&gt; Traders now see a more than 90% chance of a 75-basis-point rate hike at this week’s Fed meeting, which concludes Wednesday, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool that measures pricing in the fed funds futures markets.
*****
&gt; That change in Fed policy expectations sent rates surging, with the 10-year rate briefly topping 3.4%on Monday. The benchmark rate eased back to about 3.32% on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “The move in the 10-year Treasury yield toward 3.5% shows the market’s fear that the Fed may fall further behind the curve is increasing,” wrote UBS strategists led by Mark Haefele. “In turn, this will give the Fed less room to ‘declare victory’ and ease off on rate hikes. As a result, the risks of a Fed-induced recession have increased, in our view, and the chances of a recession in the next six months have risen.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is also expecting the latest reading on the May producer price index on Tuesday before the bell at 8:30 a.m.

We’ve been renting a 1 bed room for the past 2 years paying a total of 2200 for rent + utilities. 

Earlier this year, one of my relatives decided she would be selling her home to downsize. It’s in ok shape, move in ready but needs some work. Appraised at 510 and they agreed to sell it to us for 400, so seemingly an awesome deal. 

However, even though we agreed to this months ago, they couldn’t move until June (now), so we couldn’t close until now. Now with interest rates shot through the roof, I’m feeling regret. Would we have been better off overpaying 500K for a 400K house in February with a 3% interest rate, or is it better paying 400K for a 500K house and a 6% interest rate?

personalfinance,Car dealer has hinted they would take back my car which I bought on PCP UK. Negotiation tips.,"Hi guys

Looking for a bit of advice.

Last June I bought a new BMW for about 42k on PCP. I think I put down £4000 deposit and have monthly payments around £450 over 3 years. The BMW dealer has hinted that the second hand market is very hot and that they would take back the car for a good deal. 

Another important point is that the car was bought on extremely low interest rate deal (I believe &lt;2%) that BMW was offering for new cars. I guess now with interest rate rising they want to re-structure their financing packages as they can lend out at higher rates.

As the cost of living continues to soar, I think it's not a bad option to let go of my car despite only owning it one year. 

How would I approach this conversation with the salesman?  Basically, I would be quite happy to get back my 4k deposit (or as much as possible) give the car back and then buy something much cheaper in the second hand market. 

Alternatively, I could just tell them the most I can pay is 250 a month and what can they offer?

Please let me know what you would recommend in this situation so I am prepared for the conversation.

TLDR: BMW hinted they want to take my car back. I don't mind so long as I can recover mot my deposit. How do I negotiate this situation?",finance,1655213580

In general, crypto social media seems to be rather pessimistic about the current state of affairs. Investors expect interest rates to rise and fear further liquidation or hack risks. Current debates on reddit revolve around those who believe that ETH/BTC are the only safe tokens to hold, and those who believe that new projects are technically superior. There also seems to be a sentiment against HODL'ing vs cutting losses/taking gains.

So, Please participate in a survey with me on how you feel right now and what you're doing about the current market. Hopefully this will give context or peace of mind to future investors who may be in a state of euphoria in some future market cycle.

stocks,BlackRock: ‘We’re not buying the dip’,"The world’s largest asset manager is neutral on stocks despite recent losses.

While US stock markets have suffered their biggest year-to-date losses in decades, BlackRock has indicated that it will not be taking the opportunity to 'buy the dip'.

In a weekly note from the BlackRock Investment Institute, the world’s largest asset manager said it was neutral on stocks over the next six to 12 months.

This view, BlackRock said, boiled down to three main reasons, including increasing downside risks for profit margins in the future.

“We expect the energy crunch to hit growth and higher labor costs to eat into profits. The problem — consensus earnings estimates don’t appear to reflect this,” the firm said.

personalfinance,How to determine which loan to pay extra to,"I have 3 loans, a vehicle loan, federal student loan, and a house loan. They all have different interest rates and different lengths. Is there an easy way to determine which should be paid down first?

The vehicle loan has 4 years left, 2.249% interest, about $540/month, $31k left.

The federal loan, still is no interest period, but I expect about 4.5% interest rate and $31k. I don't have any idea on the payback period.

The house loan is brand new 7/1 ARM 30 years left, 3.875%, $850/month including taxes, pmi, etc., $112k total.

If I wanted to pay more on one loan to pay off faster, what loan would you pick to pay off first. I've heard a lot about paying the highest interest rate first and trying to close the smallest amount as well. What's your opinion?",finance,1655217171
personalfinance,Stupid to buy pre-construction condo w/ expected closing in 2024?,"I'm contemplating buying a unit in a new / pre-construction condo building in a major city.  Expected closing date is mid-2024.  I don't think I'm getting an absolutely incredible deal on the place, but it seems fair for today's prices.  The total payments (mortgage, taxes, HOA, etc.) should be \~20% of my current income, so seems reasonable and I should be able to weather increases in interest rates (within reason...I'm estimating max 8%).  I expect to have cash for at least a 20% down payment and then will also sell my current home, which should yield an additional 10% in cash of the purchase price of the new place.  I have other investments re: brokerage, 401K that I should be able to leave untouched in the purchase of the house.

If this were two years ago, I'd move forward, but with current market conditions, inflation, yada yada yada, I'm somewhat concerned whether this is a bad decision.  I plan to live in the place so not looking to turn an immediate profit but obviously don't want to be underwater on day 1.  My other concerns are that it's a condo building so my experience in living in the place will be somewhat dependent on every other buyer also being able to afford their homes - if everyone else is backing out at the last minute, losing their deposits, dropping prices, or can't pay HOAs, etc. it will damage the value of my unit and also my day-to-day happiness living in the building.  

Is this a stupid decision to go forward with the purchase?  Better to wait and maybe pick up a unit closer to when the building is fully built and I have a better view of rates and how sold the rest of the building is?  I like the unit floor plan, location, etc. so don't want to lose that by waiting.  I've never bought pre-construction before.",finance,1655217486
CryptoCurrency,the Celsius Situation made Simple,"Celsius exchange is a bank-like institution. You can put money in and receive interest or borrow money and owe interest.

Celsius was offering up to 7+% APY on deposits and lending as low as 1% interest rates with 50% Loan to Value (LTV). They accepted all kinds of coins as collateral.

# Option A - Unrealistically optimistic view of the situation:

Celsius lends out 20% of their holdings and keeps 80% in reserve

Person A deposits $100K worth of USDC in Celsius with 5% APY.

Person B borrows $20K worth of USDC and puts up $40K worth of DOGE with 2% interest rate. They owe ~~$666.67~~ $66.67 monthly until the loan is closed.

Celsius now holds $80K USDC and $40K worth of DOGE.

After one year DOGE is down 70%. Person B's collateral is now less than their loan amount. Person B defaults.

Celsius now holds $80K USDC and $12K worth of DOGE + $800 they received in interest payments. Their liabilities are the $105K they owe person A and their assets are valued at $92.8K. They are in the red $12.2 K. If DOGE recovers they can maybe pay person A back, or they could start allowing A to withdraw a portion of their loan and at least recover some money.

# Option B - Less optimistic view:

Same as above except instead of lending 20% of their holdings they lend 80% of their holdings. 80% of their held assets are in random volatile garbage that is tanking across the board. Many of their loans are defaulting. Now they might be in the red up to 50% or more of A's initial loan.

# Option C - Pessimistic view:

Celsius was lending out 80% or more of A's deposit AND lending out 80% of the collateral that B was borrowing against. Now Celsius's reserves are barely anything. They not only owe person A 105K that they don't have, but they also don't have money to pay back the collateral of the loans they gave out, even if those borrowers want to close the loans.

If you **think about what a bank would need to do to pay 5% APY to deposits and offer loans at 1% interest**, then something between option B and C is probably what was actually happening. If this is accurate don't expect any investors to swoop in and save the day.

EDIT: u/Mathiasdk2 pointed out that when the collateral dips below the loan amount the borrow receives a margin call and must add more collateral, pay off some of the loan, or have Celsius convert the collateral to pay down the loan. This type of transaction would not be immediate, especially if a portion of the collateral was tied up in other loans, such as in option C.",cryptocurrency,1655218002
personalfinance,Any Risks to Moving Bond Fund to TIPS ?,"I have a medium duration bond fund that is doing almost as poorly as my stock funds due to the increase in interest rates. I want to move some portion of these into TIPS. My goal is primarily to preserve capital instead of make gains. I'm willing to hold the TIPS to maturity.

TIPS currently have negative interest rates. However after inflation the real return is greater than any other investment in the market today. Inflation would have to drop to 0-1% before the negative interest rate resulted in a real loss.

Shouldn't refinancing include the already accrued interest? I am not super familiar with how loan refinancing works, but I always imagined that another lender would have to payoff the principle *and* the accrued interest to my old lender, and then they can give me a brand new loan of $185k and a new interest rate.

CryptoCurrency,Wen bottom?,"Macro economic fed monetary policies are the driving force of not just the equities market but across all markets of the financial system including crypto assets. This has never been more apparent to the crypto asset class than it is right now.  The US dollar is currently experiencing the worst inflation it has seen in 40 years.  Inflation is bad because it devalues the currency and reduces the purchasing power.  It’s really bad for risk-on assets because of the implications of high inflation.  High inflation means the fed will use its “tools” in its monetary policy toolbox to help bring down the inflation rate to acceptable levels.  Rising interest rates is their front line of defense against inflation.  

Interest rates determine how much it costs borrowers to get a loan.  Higher interest rates means there is less of an incentive to borrow money, it’s more expensive.  The higher the rates go generally the less money people borrow.  Less money being put into the market means there is less buying pressure and when there is less buying pressure it means bears are firmly in control.  

All risk-on assets will generally see a continued sell off across the broader markets as a whole.  This doesn’t mean down only, there could be a week or multiple weeks where there is a rally but it will get sold off and we will trend lower then where the rally started.

When the fed makes a dovish reversal on interest rates we will likely see a reversal in price action as well.  Now the only way realistically the fed makes a dovish reversal is if inflation peaks and is trending down.  With the latest CPI data for the month of May showing inflation still rising strong, it means the fed will continue its hawkish policy on rate hikes.

So wen bottom?  When inflation has peaked and it is beginning to trend down we will likely see a reversal at that time.  You don’t know if inflation has peaked until you have months of CPI data showing inflation going down.  Which means at a minimum we need to see 3-4 months of CPI data going down.  Which means the bottom for risk-on assets including crypto will at the earliest occur in Q4 2022 but more likely sometime in 2023.  I know that’s not a very narrow time frame but it is something to look at when making decisions to navigate the crypto market.  We have plenty of time to make our investing decisions before prices sustainably go up.  

Crypto has never seen these macro economic market conditions before.  We are in uncharted bear market territory here.  This is only my opinion and it could be completely wrong so don’t take this too seriously.  I’m not a professional, just a retail investor.  Food for thought.",cryptocurrency,1655222457
personalfinance,Should I buy a house right now?,"Hello, thanks for making it this far...
So I live in a city that has been growing rapidly due to transplants from high COL areas. It has finally started to cool down a bit, and there are generally more appealing houses available. I am living with my dad at the moment, rent free, while I finish saving/looking for a home. I have 20k in savings set aside already, and add about 2.5k a month. I make 65k a year, and am expecting to move into a more advanced role before the end of the year (absolute minimum of 80k/yr, no cost health insurance).

Location: HCOL, Northeast USA

Gross income: ~$130,000, stable

Current rent: $1200- absolute steal with landlord who loves us

Student Debt: currently pay $1,700 /mo , interest rate 3.3%, will increase to ~$2,300 if when federal loans to live again. Will be done private loans 9/2026, and eligible for PSLF (REPAYE) for the federal the same year.

Brokerage:~ $50k, with the current market situation. would probably use some or most of this to help with downpayment

Savings: &gt;6month emergency fund

Using the 36% household debt rule would put me at affording $1,755/month which wont even get you a 1BR apartment. I'd like to try and extend my target buying to close to $400,000, with probably 10-15% down. So all that to ask:

Would it make sense to bite the bullet and try and refinance my private loans to a longer term, to lower my monthly payment ?

Am i essentially hopeless until i pay my student debt off in this market?

I can pick up shifts and make more money, but am concerned my fed loan monthly payment will go with more income lessening the benefit (currently on REPAYE), but could this be a better option?

The inflation we are experiencing today is a combination of cost-push and demand-pull. As the summer comes to an end, supply chain bottlenecks should open up; however, if the Fed raises rates too quickly before the supply chain can adjust then we will see an increase in unemployment and thus a drop in GDP (according to Okun's law) and enter a recession.

The answer is that this are clearly extraordinary times that likely many have not seen before.

I am trying to gauge how bonkers I am for considering the following:

I would like to take out an approx. $20,000 standard bank loan to do some improvements on my home. These include a fence(becoming necessary with an older dog who needs to go out more and plans for kids...), a back deck, and some grading on the yard because we have a washed out hill that makes grass cutting an absolute nightmare.

My home is about 4 years from being paid off on a very good interest rate/payment. With the state of the economy/rates right now I am concerned I won't actually save any money refinancing it. I talked to a couple of mortgage companies and the minimum they will do a refi for is $75,000. I only owe about $30,000 on the home. Obviously I can just send some of the money right back to them on principle but it still feels bad.

The hard info is that my wife and I make \~$90,000/yr together(we're both part-time, semi-retired in our 30s)

Home mortgage of $750/mo is all we have left for debt.

I have perfect credit. I also own 3 paid off vehicles, maybe collateral if that helps my rate? If I just walk into a bank/credit union and get a $20,000-30,000 loan against my name am I an idiot? I'm guessing the rate will be in the ballpark of 5%?

I have some cash saved, but no where near enough for the 2 projects I need to get done, which in turn, will be toward a profit at some point since I plan to rent a space out.  

I want to build a deck - though prices from quotes I got 3 years ago are much more expensive now, like roughly near $20k from 13-15k.  I also need to relocate a laundry space to a closet on the second floor and build out a closet in its place.  I got quotes all over the place for that, but as low as 6k, and that was 3 years ago.  

I figure I would need about 30-35k for all and can afford reasonable payments over the next few years.  I have about $5k cash.  One of the financing pages of one of the places that does decks actually reroutes you to a page that gives you the best credit cards for rewards and starting APRs, etc., and while most are 15 months 0% interest, there were maybe 2 that had 20 months.  That kind of gave me an idea, but it's still somewhat limited...  

If I did the CC (one even states it's best for large purchases), I'm confident I could get the bulk of the balance of the deck (if not all of it) knocked out in that 20 month time, but then interest will start up at that point, and even if it's ok for the remaining balance of the deck project, it would be moot for the second project since interest would be like 15-25%.  That's all assuming I could get a starting credit line on it for at least $20k, which I think might be possible.

personalfinance,Remodel started so home equity loan denied? Mechanics lien?,"I was just told that I can't do a home equity loan because our remodel started a few weeks ago. Their reason is that since I signed a contract with a contractor, there's a possibility he would place a mechanics lien on the home if I don't pay him. I asked if there's any way around it - if I pay the contractor upfront for some amount of time, etc, and they said no.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone dealt with this? This is a huge bummer, as this is a large remodel and this loan was to cover the cost of the remodel. It'll be probably nine months or so before the remodel is done.

&amp;#x200B;

**edit** Before everyone gets angry - we have the money to cover the cost of this remodel without doing a loan. We're fine. It's just a bummer, because we didn't want to sell any investments/tie up money if we didn't have to. And now, interest rates will probably rise a good amount by the time we're done, which makes it less appealing to take out the loan.",finance,1655230034

economy,Inflation is going to last a lot longer than most people think.,"I see many posters suggesting that the current inflationary environment and recession situation we're in will end in late 2022 or early 2023. That is highly unlikely. Here is why...

It takes on average 18-24 months for the inflationary results of monetary / economic policy to play out in the and appear in the real economy. The same is true for the reverse. Raising interest rates and balance sheet roll off will take time, a lot of time... and we've only just gotten started!

If history is any guide, inflation is here to stay for the next several years. The Fed is so far behind the curve that it will take years to tame inflation... just like in the late 70's / early 80's. Back then, Paul Volker raised interest rates to obscene levels in the 15-19% range. Even then, it took years for inflation to cool down. Of course, it caused a massive recession and unemployment too, i.e. stagflation.

Also, the Fed won't be able to raise interest rates anywhere near what Volker did. The cost to service the national debt would be too high. We're already paying $420 billion dollars a year to service the debt, that's almost 9% of the entire federal budget. Do you really think we could afford it to consume 20-25% of the federal budget? No way.

If the Fed raises rates above 3%, it will actually be losing money as it will be paying more on interest to the banks on excess reserves than it brings in through its balance sheet. That is a big no no.

There is really only one way to fight inflation in a post-QE environment, and it's not raising interest rates, it's by accelerating the balance sheet roll off.

By accelerating the balance sheet roll off, the Fed will literally remove money from circulation. However, currently they're only letting $45B per month roll off, and $90B per month by the end of summer. That isn't anywhere near enough, it needs to be at least $300-400 billion per month because the Fed has a $9 Trillion balance sheet.

Instead the Fed is going to let inflation run hot for the next couple years or longer so get used to it.  Inflation is currently sitting at 8.6% YOY. It will probably reach 10% by the end of summer, and higher by the end of 2022. Now imagine it stays at 10% throughout next year... that's 20% over 2 years. That's when the real pain starts.",finance,1655235129

personalfinance,Advice needed regarding buying or renting,"Advice needed


First of all, I want to proclaim I am incredibly fortunate to be experiencing this problem. I am blessed with wonderful family. I am simply seeking advice on what to do, as I feel beat down with this market and don’t want to feel like I could have made the dream of homeownership work when I reflect back. Throughout the home search process I have tried to maintain logical and view this as a financial investment, hence why I am posting here and in the real estate forum. 

 My spouse and I are potential first time home buyers and have been house hunting since January in one of the hottest markets in the US. It’s been demoralizing. With the raise in interest rates coupled with still high prices it just feels like we are screwed. The market is definitely cooling some but it still is so expensive. 
We recently found a 300,000 townhome we love. Can see ourselves in it for 5 years. Has most of our wishlist covered minus a yard for the pup, and garage. Roof will need to be replaced soon, but water heater, AC, and all appliances are from 2019. It’s pretty turn key. The kicker is our monthly payment will be around 2600(cries and screams internally). The single family homes we were looking at when interest rates were in the 3% range went for 50,000 more and had monthly payments of about $400 less. 
It just sucks! 

Recently my in-laws sold a rental property and need to put the money sold into another property or they will be taxed heavily on the sale. They want to buy a SFH with 20-30% down, and get a monthly payment of around $2000. They came to us to see if we’d be interested renting the home they choose to buy. If so, they would look to buy in the areas we’ve been searching and consider some of our needs in the purchase. We are considering because of the state of the market, the world, and inflation of everything else. This home will be cheaper for us and will offer more than we can afford to buy. 

I’ve  been dreaming of owning my own home though and feel like we’re so close. I want a property I can call mine. I’m tired of renting. I want to build equity. Im also nervous having family as landlords. Im also worried about being embarrassed over feeling like we need ‘help’ for housing from parents. Stupid I know.

After tax our combined monthly take home is about 7600-8000.

economy,Unpopular Opinion: Inflation &amp; Supply Chain Issues Are Not the Biggest Problems - Our Consumption Is,"Lately it seems that in the U.S., the main focus seems to be on people being negatively affected by supply chain issues and inflation and those things are being identified as the main problems affecting people from getting their needs met. The basic logic is higher prices/inflation/supply chain issues = higher costs = people not being able to obtain stuff they need. I believe this take is disingenuous for a variety of reasons:

\- Even with rising costs, most people in the U.S. regardless of their social class are still able to meet their basic needs - food, clothes, iPhones. Costs for many commodities were artificially LOW during Covid (i.e. gas), and food prices in the USA have been comparatively low compared to similar nations. There is also an enormous amount of choice in where I purchase things I need - for example, I'm not spending my hard-earned $ at Whole Paycheck if I can get my groceries at Trader Joe's or Safeway at half that cost.

\- For people who cannot meet their basic needs (due to conditions such as homelessness, drug addiction, etc.) - higher wages and lower costs will not fix those problems. The social inequality often defined as people having less spending power than others was a huge problem well before these Covid-era issues began, and income inequality has been expanding for years, if not decades. Additionally, this is the first time in my lifetime that the labor market and wages are titled towards EMPLOYEES (though I do not believe that will last for very long).

\- I believe that the main problem we have with society is CONSUMPTION. We consume more and buy more and demand more than any other country on Earth (read: we also have the fattest people on average, which I believe bears some relation to all of this). Yet, there is no talk in political discourse about reducing consumption, only about creating the conditions that enable people to consume at their previous rates, even if prices are slightly higher. For most of us, it's not the actual wage you earn - it's how you choose to spend/save. We have people in this country earning six figures who are basically living paycheck to paycheck because they over-spend every month. My point is that even if you raise the minimum wage to $50/hour, that will not stop the phenomena that those yelling about it are thinking it will.

I AM NOT DISCOUNTING THE FACT THAT INFLATION EXISTS, that we have supply chain issues, or that we need to raise the federal min wage. I'm simply saying that these conditions are not necessarily resulting in people not having their basic needs met any more than they were before all of it started, and that we have various realities to acknowledge if we really want to improve conditions as a society.",finance,1655236098

CryptoCurrency,The top upvoted post right now is a feast of inaccurate information rolled up in a sandwich of bad advice.,"Remember to do your research first kids.

And don't trust information without double checking. Even my information.

The OP of the post below forgot to do that.

[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vc1z3j/why\_are\_so\_many\_of\_you\_people\_hodling\_nomatter/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vc1z3j/why_are_so_many_of_you_people_hodling_nomatter/)

Giving some inaccurate information, and some bad advice on timing the market.

Nobody knows what's going to happen, so don't try to time the market, unless you're ready to gamble.

It's a much more complex picture than OP was trying to paint.

So don't pull out everything, or go all in on shorts. Pull out only what you're not comfortable having out there.

But don't try to bet on the direction of the market. Instead strategize for multiple potential scenarios.

# 1- OP is inaccurately describing how the Fed reduces its balance sheet.

""The Fed is going to sell another $45 billion in assets in July, and another $45B in August. Then, they will increase the rate to $95 BILLION EVERY MONTH starting in September.

That's simply not true. The Fed isn't doing a selloff, it's doing a runoff. It's simply gonna let part of its balance sheet runoff and let bonds reach maturity.

They are doing that by simply not re-investing some of the bonds that come to maturity.

Evidence: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm)

# 2- ""The fed meeting is tomorrow and its going to be a .75 basis point hike"".

OP didn't provide any evidence on how he already knows this. The Fed haven't announced anything yet.

Just because everyone expects it to be .75, doesn't mean it will be.

In fact, since everyone seems to expect a .75, that would increase the likelihood that the selloff for the last few days, might be already pricing this in.

# 3- Last time we starting having QT was in October 2017.

This is back when Janet Yellen started to reduce the balance sheet by $650 Billion.

Remember what happened to Crypto in October 2017, and the following couple months?

I'm definitely not saying the same will happen. Conditions were different. And QT went on for several months, where Bitcoin started to dive again. I'm just saying QT alone isn't an automatic guarantee of anything for crypto.

Things have to be put into context.

But more importantly, policies on QT have changed since then.

2017 didn't have the result expected, and they eventually had to pull to plug on their QT.

This time around there's a couple of policies to safeguard from that happening, with some safety switches. Banks will be able to have liquidity when needed, and the New York Fed can setup unscheduled domestic repurchase agreements.

# 4- OP claims that there is ""An almost perfect correlation between crypto and the Nasdaq"".

That's not entirely accurate.

While there has been a recent increase in correlation, it has never been a 1:1, nor near perfect, nor above 0.9 in statistical correlation to stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

[In 2022 Nasdaq 100 correlation peaked at 0.7](https://preview.redd.it/r39d2rme3n591.jpg?width=1198&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e15f051e0149f1058c1894b613da5162c73f58e)

&amp;#x200B;

[0.75 correlation peak with the S&amp;P 500](https://preview.redd.it/o1h7oqyh3n591.jpg?width=1830&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c002b076a4187494959afe807f65a686032d56)

0.8 and above is generally considered ""strong correlation"". But we've only reached around 0.7 with stocks. At 0.5 you have a moderate correlation.

A short term spike from around 0.5 to 0.7 isn't exactly an ""almost perfect correlation"".

That's a little bit of an exaggeration.

# 5-""And when both the stock market and the housing market get tumultuous, risk assest get sold first. That is what you are starting to see.""

A tumultuous housing market?

It's been a fairly hot housing market, and the only thing still holding up. Or at least not at a 2008 or a housing market crisis level yet.

It's been red hot for the last 2 years.

Average house prices have vastly increased during that time, although slowed in the last quarter, reaching a historic high: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS)

There are recent signs of sales slipping, and with the supply chain unclogging, inventories started to increase. So a correction could already be in the works.

It might crash. Maybe next month. Maybe next decade. But we don't know that yet. 

Also, Bitcoin has been selling off since November of last year. When the stock market was still reaching new highs month after month. We already entered a bear market before stocks started to tank.

We've seen mixed information about this.

Earlier this year, on the day stocks dropped into correction, Bitcoin went up.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin vs S&amp;P 500 on the day stocks officially entered \\""correction\\""](https://preview.redd.it/3h13rb7d4n591.jpg?width=1335&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce3d1fc4552473ed2512b7eb72173d9aaed73488)

Then it went on to go in a mini bull run from $35K to $47K when the war broke out in Ukraine, while stocks were tanking.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fvgi7g4k4n591.jpg?width=1330&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=494db109a610bcbbe44abbbde21a5d0ce48e796b

When Chinese markets tanked between the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, and the stock market in the US went into a little panic and dipped into correction, Bitcoin went from around $200 to around $400.

On the other side of that, Bitcoin crashed with the rest of the world during the covid crash.

So the correlation isn't always consistent or guaranteed.

It's not a sure fire thing you can rely on.

# 6- At the end of the day, the picture is more complicated than that. Never trust anyone who tells you things will definitely go worse, or definitely go better.

No one really knows.

Keep in mind, markets are based on emotions more than fundamentals. So they can always do something irrational.

But the fundamentals aren't even that crystal clear.

We are in a bear market, and stocks are heading into recession.

But at the same time, we have conflicting data.

We had negative GDP in the US, in big part because of the big jump in trade deficit. Which came from the after effects of covid restrictions, and supply chain clogs.

But now the bottlenecks in the main US ports have dropped by nearly 40%. So it's not guaranteed that GDP will be negative again next quarter.

Also, unemployment is at a historic low. And at the same time, 2022 had some of the highest wage increases in over 10 years.

Consumer spending has been up 2.7% despite inflation. And even inflation adjusted, it's still up 0.7%.

OPEC has started to increase its output, and is set to increase its output in July by another 400K barrels a day. Possibly more if they reach an agreement with the G7.

That could help quell both inflation and supply chain problems.

So the outlook is a little more complex.

If it was a sure thing, we'd all be millionaires.",cryptocurrency,1655236421

CryptoCurrency,The best exchanges are the ones that can survive the bear market.,"Cryptocurrency started with Bitcoin and the need for decentralization. A place far away from the infinite money printers owned by the FED. The last two years have sadly painted another picture. Crypto is sadly not inflation and global bear market proof. 

Centralized exchanges filled in the gaps between easy access and decentralization. But, enter the bear market and with that centralized exchanges are having a hard time. Why? Should they not just be the biggest market makers and easiest on/off ramps only? They should provide liquidity to the market, but most importantly be an easy way in and an easy way out. And on both of these sides they should be making money. 

How is it then that they, Coinbase, CDC, need to lay off people only 6 month after the first big dips? And even worse Celsius even flat out not having enough liquidity. They either did not have the crypto to begin and when people were withdrawing in droves they blocked it. 

Once again, they should be making even more money with all this volume and volatility. Their earning models are just to flawed. They flew too close to the sun and thus pose a risk for all of us. First off, they drag the whole market down with them, but worse they don't give access to the keys. And we all know what that can mean. 

Buy through trusted exchanges, like Kraken (which have a 100% backing proof), and then transfer out. Only the best exchanges, that truly have the best in heart for crypto and its users, earn to survive the bear market. 

After that the only solution is; get your crypto off exchange. Get it in your own wallet, with your own keys. Bring decentralization back.",cryptocurrency,1655237461
CryptoCurrency,Could (or would) the US government use Ripple's XRP as a base for a US CBDC?,"It is quite likely that the US government, at some point, will shift towards their own central bank digital currency, due to the speed, accessibility, and functionality of blockchain based currencies. In doing this, is there any reason why the federal government would not look at an already established currency to base their token off of? Or, with the government's resources, would they prefer to create their own blockchain?

I am not an expert on Ripple by any means, but I know some basics. Because of Ripple's lawsuit with the SEC, one must imagine that the government has to have familiarity, and maybe even a special interest in Ripple. It could even be possible that the lawsuit itself is an effort to keep the XRP price down, for when the US does decide to go that route, and release their CBDC, which in this hypothetical, would be built off XRP. 

Ripple is very scalable, which gives an obvious reason for ripple being the possible choice, and additionally, Ripple is centralized, compared to many of the other top cryptocurrencies, allowing for a lot of control, top down from the government.

personalfinance,Help Calculating Capital Gains Tax for Real Estate,"Could anyone please help me calculate capital gains tax for a primary residence my family and I are selling? Some background information - my family initially bought the house in California at 280k and over the past three decades, the property value has ballooned to 1.2 million. This house is our primary residence for that whole time but now we're moving on. We also have very minimal income, so for the sake of these calculations, I'm not including them.

I've done some research online on calculating federal and state capital gains tax and deductions, but I would much appreciate if someone who is more knowledgeable check my math/info. So from what I understand, I would take the value of the sale, 1.2 million, and deduct 500k as a married filing status, and then deduct an additional 280k which is the original value of the house. If I'm correct, I can also deduct the cost of the sale in terms of realtor commission and some repairs/upgrades, which is about 60k for commission and about 15k commission. So all in all, I'm looking at 1.2 million - 500k - 280k - 60k - 15k = 345k , my taxable profit. 

Of this 345k, I saw that up to \~80k of it is subjected to 0% federal tax according to a table I saw online, which would leave the remainder 265k taxable at the next bracket 15% since it is between the 80k to 500k tax bracket. Would this mean we would pay 15% of 345k, which is about 40K?

For California tax, is it the same methodology with the same deductions leading to 345k, except the tax percent is now 9.3% for between 115k to 590k bracket?

CryptoCurrency,The truth about Halvings,"**Bitcoin supporters have popularized this idea that after halvings, prices will skyrocket due to less selling pressure from miners. While this sounds fine in theory, there's no direct evidence of this. Other cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin's design also have halvings, and they don't see price trajectory changes either. Every time Bitcoin rose noticeably after a halving, it was months later, and there was usually a more-rational explanation for it.**

The evidence suggests that halvings actually have negligible effect on the prices. For example, the myth of the halving likely has a greater effect than the halving itself. The 2020 halvings contributed to only $10-20 billion less Bitcoin being sold over an entire year. That's totally not enough to explain its market cap rising from $200B to $1.1T in just 5 months. There were other more important factors, like Quantitative Easing followed by FOMO.

There are other cryptocurrencies that have halvings like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash that have different halving dates. If you take a more detailed look at all 3 of these cryptocurrencies following their halving dates, you'll find that the halvings have had no perceivable effect on their prices. Their prices tend to move up and down with the other cryptocurrencies regardless of their actual halving dates.

-------------

##Direct Effects After the Halving

###Bitcoin

**Halving 1**: 2012-11-28 - **No immediate effect** on Bitcoin's price. Around Feb-Apr of 2013, the price suddenly rose. The volume of trading was a lot lower back then. Price rose likely due to [price manipulation by bots](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/researchers-finds-that-one-person-likely-drove-bitcoin-from-150-to-1000/)

**Halving 2**: 2016-07-09 - **No effect** on the general upward curve of Bitcoin price between Mar 2015 and Mar 2017. Price pumped after Mar 2017 likely due to [price manipulation by Tether and BitFinex](https://www.wsj.com/articles/large-bitcoin-player-manipulated-price-sharply-higher-study-says-11572863400) and ICOs raising funds.

**Halving 3**: 2020-05-11 - **No effect** on Bitcoin price. Price suddenly increased in Nov 2020 after multiple rounds of Quantitative Easing and the COVID-lockdowns easing up.

###Litecoin

**Halving 1**: 2015-08-25 - **No effect**. Price went sideways for another 2 years before suddenly popping in Mar 2017, the same time that Bitcoin did.

**Halving 2**: 2019-08-05 - **No effect**. Price was already declining and continued declining or trading sideways for the next year. Even looking at the LTC vs BTC chart, there was no effect from the Halving.

###Bitcoin Cash

**Halving 1**: 2020-04-09 - **No effect**. Prices went sideways until a rise in Nov 2020, which is the same time that Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market shot up following the Fed's QE.

-------------

##Indirect Effects Before the Halving

We can also look at price trajectory changes before the halving instead of after it. In this case, we do normally see slightly positive shifts in about 70% of all cases 6 months before the halving. So it is possible that the myth about the halving has an small effect while the direct effects of halving are completely unnoticeable.

personalfinance,How to determine payoff of credit card with two interest rates,"I put a little python script together to help me better visualize paying off some credit card debt.

Anyway, my question is how to calculate the payoff of a card with two rates (ie: standard rate and promotional balance transfer rate).

Say you have a balance of $1500 at 13.99%. You take the promotion for a $1500 (with fee) balance transfer at 0.00% for 12 months. If this isn't the first card to be paid off, how do you figure the minimum payment?

My wife and I recently paid off both of our cars \[2012 Dodge Journey \~125k and 2014 Chevy Impala \~100k\]. We currently pay $158/mon for car insurance, save $500 for a new vehicle purchase someday, and have an extra $100 stored away for potential maintenance. In total, this equates to 9.7% of our net monthly pay. We are too busy to make one car work for an extended period of time.

We were just offered around $7k for the 2012 Dodge Journey (local dealership), does it make sense to entertain the offer?

My simple math tells me that Waiting a year to replace one of the cars would add $6k in savings + the trade in at the time + the potential for the market to cool off a bit. However, we run the risk of 7% interest rates. 

On the other hand, we take it, buy a new car and finance for under 4% and get the payments started a year early which could give us a realistic chance to pay off a new car before my Impala would need to be replaced.

economy,"As a Turk, I am telling what is going on in Turkey.","Let me tell you first. None of this is investment advice. (It is illegal to give investment advice in my country). I just want you to see how we are as a Turk.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give you some information about what is happening in my country.  According to TUIK (Official Statistics Institute), annual inflation is 73.5%, but when you follow the daily prices, you can easily understand that the government is playing with these figures.According to an independent inflation research institution (ENAG), annual inflation has exceeded 160%.  According to my daily experience, I find this figure more accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

We have presidential and parliamentary elections in June 2023. (In a way that I do not approve of, the President is now elected by the people. In the old system, the president was chosen by the deputies.)

It may not look like it from the outside, but the majority of Turkish people are secular. They are uncomfortable with the mixing of religion and state affairs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's get to the main topic. Why does Erdogan not raise interest rates despite high inflation and constant increase in exchange rates?

You will find it very funny, but the only reason for this is a verse in the Qur'an that states that interest is haram. He is an authoritarian conservative and has recently suffered from physical and mental health problems. He's going through the power poisoning to the bottom.

He did not like to break his word, so he took out tools that do not look like interest. Currency indexed deposits and GES.

CID (KKM in Turkish) : You deposit your money in TRY in the bank. If there is an increase in the USD/TRY above the official interest rate, the state treasury pays the remaining part.

GES: It offers 23% interest rate.

Not only that. At first, they thought that consumption would collapse at these inflation rates, so they started to give cheap loans. They are giving out loans at seriously ridiculous interest rates. However, since the lower strata of the population could not afford the repayment of these loans, this loan service was started mostly to transfer wealth to the rich.

Just a few days ago, they passed a new law to seize (unobtrusively) 70% of exporters' foreign exchange income.

Turkey's CDS exceeded 850s. It continues to rise. And if you're wondering, let me tell you. The central bank and ministries are completely in Erdogan's hands. They will continue to lower interest rates.  When they realized that they could not manage before, they made changes in these ministries and increased the interest.

Turkey has a payment of 221 billion USD to be returned in the short term. And the reserve of our Central Bank is -56 billion USD. They keep making SWAP deals to make the reserve look positive.

Annualized current account deficit in April is $26 billion. But we have a different situation. We have a value called ""net errors and omissions"" for the money that enters the country without knowing the source. This is 11.5 billion USD for 4 months. It represents depository currencies coming from abroad to relieve the market and keep the exchange rate under control before each election period. Sometimes companies bring in foreign currency to maintain their current account balance.

As far as I can see from current polls and society, the government will change in 2023. Until then, we'll keep crawling. We look forward to that day..

personalfinance,Questions about selling my home. Worried about financial security and potential economic downturn. Looking for advice on how to proceed.,"I purchased my home roughly 9 months ago for $400,000 in florida. I paid approximately $50,000 down and have been making payments on time ever since. It is in mostly good shape but does need several repairs. Mainly, a new roof. I estimate it will cost between $15 and $20,000. 

With what seems to be a potential economic downturn or even a recession coming up, I'm worried about home prices dropping. Furthermore, I'm worried about putting money into the property if I can't recover it. Since purchasing my house, it's gone up in value and I have the opportunity to sell it, recovering my down payment plus an additional 30k. Looking for opinions on whether or not this is a good time to sell. I'm concerned that if I don't sell now, my home value will go down significantly and I'll be stuck in a property which is not worth what I'm paying. However, I do have a good interest rate at only 2.8% and my concern is that if I do sell, it may be difficult to find something in the future with the way that interest rates have and are projected to rise.

personalfinance,"In a recession, is it better to invest or pay off student loan debt?","I'm stuck at step 3 of the flowchart.  I have about $75k in student loan debt, ranging in interest rates from 4-8% - so the interest rates are just in that range where I might contribute more to retirement, or I might pay down the loans.  During the forbearance, I've been putting the money I would be paying towards my student loans into a HYSA.  I've saved up about $45k in that account, which will knock out my two highest-interest loans.  The plan is to take that amount and attack my loans using the avalanche method.  That will free up a decent amount of cashflow.

The downside of this approach is that I've had to put off retirement savings to some degree.  I contribute to my 401k up to match, and I fully fund my Roth, but that's about it.  The rest goes to student loans (and/or to my emergency fund, just because I like to be conservative with that).

As I turn to my lower interest debt, though, I'm wondering about the wisdom of this approach.  I've read here that inflation makes my remaining debt cheaper than it was before.  That makes me think that I should just be making minimum payments on the remainder of my student loan debt and investing the rest.

To give you an idea, knocking out the highest two loans will free up about $750/month.  My remaining student loan payments are about $430/month.  So I guess the question is - in a recession, with the inflation we're seeing, is that $750/month better spent on more student loan payments, or on increasing my 401k contributions?

Or would a hybrid approach be better?  Typically, I take my net earnings for the month and divide them by 3.  I then put 1/3 into a vacation fund, 1/3 into my student loan surplus account (in addition to the minimum payment I've been putting in there), and 1/3 into my emergency fund.  I could just continue that.

CryptoCurrency,Opinion: collapse of USDT,"The collapse of USDT is one that I believe is impending and, honestly, looking forward to (so my analysis may be biased). Obligatory ""I've been in the space for a while and seen a few things.""

First and foremost, people are exiting out of Tether. This isn't a normal retail exit. When someone exchanges USDT for USDC, for example, on an exchange, that's not a real exit of USDT. The chart below shows that since May 2022, there have been billions of USDT being exited into cash. In May, the market cap of Tether (i.e., the total supply) sat at $83B. Today, it sits at $70B. So there is $13B tether liquidated from the market.

https://preview.redd.it/mfrr64jdup591.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcd64df8e693ca65f126f3980b7f06911b5a2413

The problem with this $13B liquidation though, originates at the source of this [report published by Tether](https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/4EtXPBkmEPDNbIHNajz9vQ/bb4766acfe36f5af0c4e54a2694c8a31/tether-march-31-2021-reserves-breakdown.pdf), stating that only 2.94% of its reserves are in cash. The pie chart in that document is a bit misleading -- it says 3.87%, but it is 3.87% of the 75.85% category of ""Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents &amp; Other Short Term Deposits &amp; Commercial Paper.""

That report was published on March 31, 2021. At that time, the market cap of Tether was \~$62B (see chart below). 2.94% of that is $1.8B. We can also play out a second scenario: assume the cash reserves grew in tandem with the market cap. If that's the case, then at $83B, $2.4B would be in cash reserve.

https://preview.redd.it/vju5zl19wp591.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8c87c7a90edb13490d92c16b74f56c3aa9dd5e1

Regardless of whether we take the $1.8B or $2.4B as true, those are both peanuts compared to the $13B liquidated from Tether in the past month. In fact, the liquidations would be 5.3x to 7.1x more than what Tether has in supposed cash reserves. To be able to account for this liquidation with actual cash, Tether would need to have 16% of its reserve in cash. I doubt it.

So in my opinion, I now assume that Tether is dry of its cash reserves. This is where things start to get sticky. We can categorize their holdings into three categories: liquid, short-term, and long-term:

* Liquid is basically cash (2.94%). These are things Tether can reach for to cover the cash people are asking for when they exit from Tether immediately. As I just talked about, my assumption is they're out of this.
* Short-term is stuff they can potentially liquidate quickly (potentially at a penalty, so the value is not 1:1 necessarily) if they really need to, in order to cover the cash people are still asking for after they run out of liquid. We assume that 72.9% of Tether's supply (78.85% - 2.94%) can be categorized as this although ""short-term"" in this case is really subjective. Out of this 72.9%, I assume that USDT has already dipped into \~13% (16% - 2.94%). So approximately 60% is left over.
* Long-term is everything else: 24.15% (100% - 75.85%). These are things that just can't really be liquidated easily except at extreme penalty. Also to note, out of the 24.15% we can safely assume the ""other investments"" category of 1.64% is probably useless and less than 1.64% now because 1) it includes investments in crypto, and 2) the crypto market has crashed. These could be illiquid investments into projects that don't have tokens on the secondary market yet, or they could be other cryptoassets, which probably will come at a significant premium if liquidated quickly (we don't know how much of these investments are liquid or illiquid, but either way we can say that it's fairly useless in this market). If Tether needs to tap into the long-term category, it's already pretty much game over.

And the name of the game is bank run. Bank run on an unsustainable model destroyed Luna/Terra, and bank run can destroy Tether as well. For those that don't know, a bank run happens when people all run to the bank to cash out at the same time. The bank doesn't have enough cash to give to everyone, which causes more panic and more people demanding to cash out. Ultimately, trust in the currency is lost, and people start cashing out at lower market value, tumbling the value of the currency into oblivion.

The bank run for Tether would begin as what looks like normal withdrawals, which can be covered by its liquid assets. This would be a 1:1 exchange. Based on my back-of-the-napkin math explained above, I believe the liquid assets are exhausted. Now Tether is tapping into its short-term assets. Some of these may come at a slight cost to liquidate (market volatility, penalties, etc.). This would not be a 1:1 exchange, so Tether needs to liquidate a bit extra to cover everyone who's asking for a dollar. I don't believe the short-term assets are all exhausted yet, so Tether can continue to carry this charade for a bit longer. In the event that people start to liquidate more USDT, then Tether will exhaust its short-term assets and have to tap into its long-term assets. If the flag hasn't been raised up to this point, it's certainly full mast now. The long-term assets are hard to immediately liquidate without penalties or market impact. Anyway, you see the picture.

With the cash reserve at Tether exhausted, I believe it marks the beginning of a potential bank run. In the recent 2018 crash, you can see that the confidence in Tether barely faltered (barely noticeable the amount being . In fact, the printing of Tether continues at a much more rapid pace moving forward. The market was still dependent on Tether.

But in May 2022, the severe liquidation of Tether began. That's the steep drop at the end of the blue line. With the crash of UST and the depegging of algorithmic stablecoins, I think the industry trust and sentiment towards stablecoins in general has faltered. And for good reason--taking a look at USDT, we can see that it has not recovered its peg to $1 since May 10 (see image below), which is right around the time that the major liquidations of USDT began.

https://preview.redd.it/z16n8xhz1q591.png?width=1510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803bc5e6e4ae62405c313afe3992f08f92bd38b7

The bear market in crypto, combined with all this news around big players like Luna/Terra, Celsius, and (potentially) 3AC collapsing, combined with all of the macro signals that indicate a recession (inflation, fed interest rate hikes, global war, food shortages, etc) are pushing people to get out of risky assets. As a result, we see the price of crypto dropping. And the circulation of USDT along with it. So people aren't just exiting cryptos into stablecoins; they're exiting USDT as well.

They are exiting USDT and either going into fiat or liquidating into other assets like USDC. You can see the chart for USDC market cap below, which started printing the same day that USDT collapsed, and has been growing in circulation ever since.

https://preview.redd.it/vpe7uhap2q591.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c490b647446d1593ebe4d2870a51d94ca958e1bc

I think this is at least some indicator that people aren't just exiting crypto altogether, but also the trust and, ultimately, dependence, on USDT is waning. Following this current trajectory, I think there are a couple of scenarios that could result:

1. USDT remains pegged to $1.
2. USDT depegs from the dollar very quickly due to a bank run from lack of confidence in USDT. This would ultimately result in the collapse of USDT. This depeg would likely put significant stress on the market.
3. USDT doesn't immediately depeg from the dollar, but dependence on USDT wanes, such that eventually once USDT does depeg, it doesn't affect the market very significantly.

And this is where my bias sets in. I don't wish harm or financial difficulty on anyone, and I mean no ill will to the Tether team. But I do hope that Tether also gets wiped during this crash. I think part of Tether's demise is already baked into the market, and evidence of this is demonstrated throughout this piece. On a more philosophical tone, Tether's demise is one that, I believe, is necessary for web3 to continue to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner. This market has been brutal to the unsustainable models, and I hope that Tether is no exception. It is a symbol of a broken system, and a collective delusion of the market that indicate that the market itself isn't ready to be taken seriously.",cryptocurrency,1655272715

economy,The Financial Market will unravel.,"Yesterday a discussion on CNBC became contentious between the  reporter (asking questions about credit tightening) and holding market ""Experts"" to answer with substance and not flare. 

US T-bonds yeild across the board were 3.4-3.5%
S&amp;P down 21% from YrHi

I heard that the fed now owns 30% of the MBS market. I knew the fed was buying Corporate debt(including junk rated) and MBS. But 700 billion in MBS in the last 18-24 months for a grand total of over 2 trillion. The fed has intervened to keep credit/bond markets from freezing when about 12 to 18 months ago high yield Corporate bonds were not trading and their face value fell below 60cents on the dollar. So all the while the Fed stepped in and started  buying corporate bonds outstanding and also creating  artificial demand for MBS products. 

As the Fed raises rates, bonds that have a coupon will have increase cost to service the debt.  As a result corporate credit ratings will downgrade. New bond issuance will be more and more expensive until no more are issued/sold to market and credit freezes and the debt structure is unsustainable. Corprate debt in the US is a staggering all time high. Mass Corporate bankruptcies are coming. It will shock the credit market and freeze. It will be a Global Liquidity Crisis.

There is also nearly 1 trillion in outstanding margin debt. As  we enter a bear market and the sell off continues, these loans will be called and will accelerate the sell off in the Stock Market.",finance,1655282783

* The meeting is set to take place at 11 a.m. Frankfurt time

*Carolynn Look*

&gt; The European Central Bank’s Governing Council will hold an unscheduled meeting to discuss the recent selloff in government bonds, which has grown in intensity after plans were announced to begin raising interest rates from record lows.
&gt; 
&gt; The rate-setting panel will convene on Wednesday “to discuss current market conditions,” according to an ECB spokesperson. The meeting will begin at 11am Frankfurt time, a person familiar with the matter said. A statement may follow.
&gt; 
&gt; The announcement comes after the yield on Italy’s 10-year debt rose above 4% for the first time since 2014 this week. Investors are so far unconvinced the ECB can raise borrowing costs to combat unprecedented euro-zone inflation while also keeping yields among the bloc’s most vulnerable members in check.
&gt; 
&gt; A possible 75 basis-point rate increase from the Federal Reserve later in the day could add to the jitters.
&gt; 
&gt; Italian yields fell back as much as 29 basis points to 3.89% at Wednesday’s open, while the euro rose as much as 0.6% to 1.0475 against the dollar and money markets pared bets on a half-point rate hike next month to 50%.
&gt; 
&gt; “The central bank needs to be concerned if investors cannot buy or sell bonds in secondary markets and issuers have to postpone funding,” said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank. “In contrast to earlier episodes of disorderly market movements, however, inflation makes the difference this time around. The ECB cannot simply pour money at the problem as monetary tightening and higher rates are actually needed.”
&gt; 
&gt; While government bonds have been jumpy for some time, the ECB has so far only allocated reinvestments from its pandemic asset-purchase program toward stabilizing what it considers unwarranted market turbulence.
&gt; 
&gt; Investors, meanwhile, have been on the lookout for an additional instrument to tackle so-called fragmentation, and there was some disappointment when officials didn’t unveil one at their policy meeting last week.
&gt; 
&gt; ### ‘No Limits’
&gt; 
&gt; While the Governing Council says it can quickly devise a new tool, it’s been reluctant to reveal details, convinced that there are few benefits in doing so and worried the markets may immediately try to test its limits.
&gt; 
&gt; Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel -- who’s in charge of the ECB’s market operations -- signaled Tuesday evening that any response to bond-market panic will come when it’s needed and will depend on the specific situation officials are faced with.
&gt; 
&gt; She did, however, pledge that the ECB won’t tolerate “changes in financing conditions that go beyond fundamental factors and that threaten monetary-policy transmission,” saying the commitment to stave off fragmentation “has no limits.”
&gt; 
&gt; Those remarks drew parallels to former ECB President Mario Draghi’s famous 2012 promise to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. Schnabel highlighted the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and the OMT created under Draghi as examples of policy makers’ ability to respond to different kinds of market stress.
&gt; 
&gt; The bond storm comes with the ECB poised to end eight years of negative rates with a “sustained” cycle of hikes planned from July and including a likely half-point move in September. It plans to end net purchases under a long-standing bond-buying program at the start of next month.
&gt; 
&gt; Several Governing Council members were due to speak on Wednesday. Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel’s remarks at 11:15 a.m. in Milan have been cancelled, as have Bank of Spain chief Pablo Hernandez de Cos’s at 2:30 p.m.

CryptoCurrency,The reversal will not happen at a specific price. It will happen at specific market conditions.,"The sub is filled with “How low will it go” posts and people trying to guess a specific price the reversal will happen. The truth is that it will go lower until the inflation gets under control. I know is weird, the inflation should help crypto’s case not work against it but looking at the bigger picture will help understand the situation.    

The FED at the moment is pumping the value of the USD by continuously raising interest rates and by that effect lowering the value of everything that is paired against the dollar. It’s not more complicated than that. Once inflation will be brought down to normal levels and the quantitive tightening will stop, then the other assets can catch a break and return to normal.    

Yes there is the option where they can’t control the inflation and people will lose faith in the dollar in which case everything will explode in value but honestly when one of the world’s biggest economy will go through hyperinflation, half of the other nations would be absolutely ruined. The Euro and GBP are burning to the ground at the moment and it’s making the USD more of a safe space than ever to have your money in.

So basically it’s a matter of economic stability more than Bitcoin’s price.",cryptocurrency,1655289245
stocks,Something to be cautious for: US10Y Treasuries have not priced EOY rate expectations yet,"I'm a perma bull as you can see from my post history and it is my belief that financial conditions will get tight so fast, Fed will have to back-pedal and stop the tightening close to winter or start cutting rates after the winter.

HOWEVER, right now it's an undeniable fact that after the WSJ leak, the market is giving *0 percent* chance to anything less than 75 bps hikes for the next two meetings, and 10% chance to one 100 and one 75 hike. Three 75 bps hikes are at 35% chance and EOY expectations are around at 375 - 400. You can check it out at CME FedWatch. 

But when we look at the US02Y we see that it's at 3.30 and US10Y is at 3.38.

I think this means the treasuries have not yet priced in the EOY expectations in Fed rates and if that is true due to the DCF valuations should further fall *until* Fed rate expectations start falling and 10 Year yields start following.

I want to be clear I'm only looking at this from the DCF valuations side and not including economic conditions to this post.

What do you think?

btc,My theory of why bitcoin is crashing and how anyone could have easily predicted it,"When bitcoin was created, interest rates dropped to an 'emergency rate' of 0.5% and then stayed low for much longer than it should have e.g. the emergency was over but they kept rates low anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

The second part of the picture was very soon after bitcoin launched. Central banks began the new process of quantitative easing, which effectively devalues the currency over time because it creates new money out of thin air.

&amp;#x200B;

The easy money policies of ultra low 'emergency interest rates' and the never before tested quantitative easing lead to investors fleeing cash, looking anywhere to get a good return. Enter bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is the same driving force behind the real estate boom.

&amp;#x200B;

When this all started in 2009 there was very little inflation and the expectation was that there was a risk of deflation, not inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

So despite the warnings and constant votes against policy from fed rate setter Thomas Hoenig, who believed that the ultra easy money policies would bring back inflation, the fed ignored him and kept stoking inflation: [https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/28/inflation-interest-rates-thomas-hoenig-federal-reserve-526177](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/28/inflation-interest-rates-thomas-hoenig-federal-reserve-526177)

I recommend reading the Thomas Hoenig article.

&amp;#x200B;

It's no coincidence that bitcoin started another bull run soon after the pandemic started. As a result of the pandemic, central banks once again cut rates to near 0 and began even larger quantatitive easing rounds. Bitcoin and stocks had a long bull run as a consequence of those policies.

&amp;#x200B;

Those policies were probably a mistake. Inflation was probably already primed to return, after the past 10-12 years of easy money. The pandemic lockdowns plus the latest round of ultra low rates and 'money creation' was the trigger that brought inflation back, with a vengeance. I theorised all of this would happen at the start of the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

That's the main reason I stayed out of crypto. And when Plan B was accurately predicting the price of bitcoin for several months straight last year, I just knew it was going to end badly. He would be correct the first several times but then it would go badly wrong at the end and people would lose their money. There's a valuable lesson in that, about not investing more than you can afford to lose. And not taking financial advice on twitter.

&amp;#x200B;

In case there is anyone who hasn't figured out the obvious yet, crypto is crashing because the ultra easy money policies of central banks seem to really be coming to an end. If this is the case, the market will suffer also. The market has come to believe the fed will always bail it out, that's probably why it hasn't totally crashed yet. Maybe the market will be right, and the fed will chicken out on ending easy money e.g. ultra low rates + quantatitive easing.

&amp;#x200B;

The way things are looking, interest rates are going to have to go up a lot. And the quantatitive easing experiement certainly has to be finished with. If anything, quantatitive tightening is what comes next. It will do exactly as it says, money will become tighter.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: The easy money days of the past 10-12 years are likely gone and they are not likely to come back. If that is the case, it's going be a long crypto winter.",cryptocurrency,1655291050

The prospect of faster-than-expected monetary tightening has rattled Wall Street, dragging the S&amp;P 500 deeper into bear territory Tuesday and forcing investors to reassess ***a stock market that doesn’t look cheap even after its dramatic selloff.***

It has been an ugly spell in markets, reflecting concerns about how the economy will hold up as the Federal Reserve embarks on its sharpest campaign of interest-rate increases in decades. Investors expect an increase of 0.75 percentage point on Wednesday, which would be the largest since 1994. 

Many investors contend that the worst in markets might soon be over, given the extended declines in many market sectors this year and the generally healthy state of the U.S. economy. They say buying the dip has fallen out of favor during this year’s rout but that negative sentiment is often a precursor to an extended rebound.

But ***even many optimists in the stock market concede that a rebound would have to contend with some significant obstacles, first and foremost the continued high level of valuations, which over time tend to be one of the strongest factors for predicting market performance.*** Even with the S&amp;P 500 down 22% in 2022, many investors and analysts fear that stock-market valuations have further to fall. The S&amp;P 500 traded Monday at 15.8 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, according to FactSet, still above the 15-year average of 15.7.

Raising rates Wednesday by a larger 0.75-percentage-point, or 75-basis-point, jump could be one way for the Fed to catch up to an increase in inflation that has been far higher and persistent than officials anticipated. Evidence that measures of inflation expectations by businesses and households over the long run are rising would be especially alarming inside the central bank.

“My sense is that the Fed has decided to do 75 basis points rather than 50 basis points because of the data we’ve gotten over the last week or so showing higher inflation and maybe some more disturbing news on inflation expectations,” former New York Fed President William Dudley said at The Wall Street Journal CFO Network event on Tuesday.

But he said he expected officials were “probably splitting the difference” by opting instead for the 0.75-percentage-point move.

Analysts who closely parse the central bank’s policies were divided Tuesday over whether the potential costs outweighed any benefits from shifting to a more aggressive 0.75-percentage-point rate rise from the half-point rate increase expected before the recent inflation reports.

Some warned that the central bank, by having recently provided unusually precise steers that it would raise rates by a half percentage point this week, risked sowing greater confusion in financial markets. Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, in a note to clients on Tuesday said he was worried that the 0.75-point rate increase “is not embedded in a credible and systematic policy strategy and, without this, risks looking like a panicky response…that may not age well.”

Mr. Guha, a former adviser at the New York Fed, said such a move created a “serious morning-after problem” by inviting difficult-to-answer questions about what the Fed would do next. 

***The Fed’s campaign to tame inflation is upending the dynamics that ruled the stock market in recent years, when rock-bottom interest rates drove investors to seek returns in risky assets. The popular view that there were no alternatives to stocks helped push the S&amp;P 500 ever higher, reaching a recent valuation peak in September 2020 of 24.1 times its projected earnings.***

More recently, ***worries about inflation and the path of interest-rate increases have provoked turmoil in markets as well as vigorous debate over the right valuations for stocks in the current environment.*** One source of concern is the risk that the Fed’s tightening will push the economy into a recession, damaging both business fundamentals and investor sentiment. More immediately, higher interest rates reduce the value of companies’ future cash flows in frequently used pricing models.

One concern for financial markets is that bond investors are beginning to anticipate not only a sharper path of increases, but a higher destination or so-called terminal rate for the Fed. On Tuesday, investors in interest-rate futures markets placed a nearly 89% probability that the Fed would lift rates to around 4% or higher by June 2023. That market-implied probability was at 1% four weeks ago, according to CME Group.

In periods of distress, investors can be quick to decide that stocks are worth much less. And historically, valuations have fallen farther before bottoming. In the selloff of December 2018, during the Fed’s most recent previous rate-raising cycle, the S&amp;P 500’s forward multiple fell as low as 13.8. In the depths of the March 2020 selloff, as the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic shut down swaths of the economy, the index traded as low as 13.4 times its projected earnings. 

***“Markets don’t typically bottom near historical medians,” said Greg Swenson, portfolio manager at Leuthold Group. “They tend to overshoot on the downside from a valuation perspective.”***

Adding to concerns for stock investors: ***Many have begun to worry that corporate profits are coming under threat, suggesting that valuation measures based on earnings projections could be understating how expensive stocks really are.*** U.S. companies have warned of challenges on multiple fronts, from rising costs to a foreign-exchange hit from a stronger dollar.

***“Those valuation multiples are based on a really overly optimistic earnings outlook,” Mr. Swenson said.***

***Another valuation model, the Buffett Indicator, compares the value of publicly traded companies in the U.S. with the country’s gross national product. As of the end of last week, a version of that measure was 29% above its historical average and above its peak in the dot-com bubble days of 2000***, suggesting that the market is overvalued. The metric was named for Warren Buffett, who once called the indicator “probably the best single measure of where [stock market] valuations stand at any given moment.” 

Two recent surveys have shown signs that consumers’ long-term inflation expectations are rising. Fed officials have said they would want to respond aggressively to signs that such expectations were rising, or becoming “de-anchored,” because they believe the process of wringing inflation from the economy will become far more difficult if that has happened.

---

A couple notes:

1) ***For investors utilizing the passive strategy, none of this matters.***  The original plan was to DCA through thick and thin into the index, and none of this news alters that plan, at all.  Financial news like this is targeted towards people with an active component to their investment strategy.

The prospect of faster-than-expected monetary tightening has rattled Wall Street, dragging the S&amp;P 500 deeper into bear territory Tuesday and forcing investors to reassess ***a stock market that doesn’t look cheap even after its dramatic selloff.***

It has been an ugly spell in markets, reflecting concerns about how the economy will hold up as the Federal Reserve embarks on its sharpest campaign of interest-rate increases in decades. Investors expect an increase of 0.75 percentage point on Wednesday, which would be the largest since 1994. 

Many investors contend that the worst in markets might soon be over, given the extended declines in many market sectors this year and the generally healthy state of the U.S. economy. They say buying the dip has fallen out of favor during this year’s rout but that negative sentiment is often a precursor to an extended rebound.

But ***even many optimists in the stock market concede that a rebound would have to contend with some significant obstacles, first and foremost the continued high level of valuations, which over time tend to be one of the strongest factors for predicting market performance.*** Even with the S&amp;P 500 down 22% in 2022, many investors and analysts fear that stock-market valuations have further to fall. The S&amp;P 500 traded Monday at 15.8 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, according to FactSet, still above the 15-year average of 15.7.

Raising rates Wednesday by a larger 0.75-percentage-point, or 75-basis-point, jump could be one way for the Fed to catch up to an increase in inflation that has been far higher and persistent than officials anticipated. Evidence that measures of inflation expectations by businesses and households over the long run are rising would be especially alarming inside the central bank.

“My sense is that the Fed has decided to do 75 basis points rather than 50 basis points because of the data we’ve gotten over the last week or so showing higher inflation and maybe some more disturbing news on inflation expectations,” former New York Fed President William Dudley said at The Wall Street Journal CFO Network event on Tuesday.

But he said he expected officials were “probably splitting the difference” by opting instead for the 0.75-percentage-point move.

Analysts who closely parse the central bank’s policies were divided Tuesday over whether the potential costs outweighed any benefits from shifting to a more aggressive 0.75-percentage-point rate rise from the half-point rate increase expected before the recent inflation reports.

Some warned that the central bank, by having recently provided unusually precise steers that it would raise rates by a half percentage point this week, risked sowing greater confusion in financial markets. Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, in a note to clients on Tuesday said he was worried that the 0.75-point rate increase “is not embedded in a credible and systematic policy strategy and, without this, risks looking like a panicky response…that may not age well.”

Mr. Guha, a former adviser at the New York Fed, said such a move created a “serious morning-after problem” by inviting difficult-to-answer questions about what the Fed would do next. 

***The Fed’s campaign to tame inflation is upending the dynamics that ruled the stock market in recent years, when rock-bottom interest rates drove investors to seek returns in risky assets. The popular view that there were no alternatives to stocks helped push the S&amp;P 500 ever higher, reaching a recent valuation peak in September 2020 of 24.1 times its projected earnings.***

More recently, ***worries about inflation and the path of interest-rate increases have provoked turmoil in markets as well as vigorous debate over the right valuations for stocks in the current environment.*** One source of concern is the risk that the Fed’s tightening will push the economy into a recession, damaging both business fundamentals and investor sentiment. More immediately, higher interest rates reduce the value of companies’ future cash flows in frequently used pricing models.

One concern for financial markets is that bond investors are beginning to anticipate not only a sharper path of increases, but a higher destination or so-called terminal rate for the Fed. On Tuesday, investors in interest-rate futures markets placed a nearly 89% probability that the Fed would lift rates to around 4% or higher by June 2023. That market-implied probability was at 1% four weeks ago, according to CME Group.

In periods of distress, investors can be quick to decide that stocks are worth much less. And historically, valuations have fallen farther before bottoming. In the selloff of December 2018, during the Fed’s most recent previous rate-raising cycle, the S&amp;P 500’s forward multiple fell as low as 13.8. In the depths of the March 2020 selloff, as the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic shut down swaths of the economy, the index traded as low as 13.4 times its projected earnings. 

***“Markets don’t typically bottom near historical medians,” said Greg Swenson, portfolio manager at Leuthold Group. “They tend to overshoot on the downside from a valuation perspective.”***

Adding to concerns for stock investors: ***Many have begun to worry that corporate profits are coming under threat, suggesting that valuation measures based on earnings projections could be understating how expensive stocks really are.*** U.S. companies have warned of challenges on multiple fronts, from rising costs to a foreign-exchange hit from a stronger dollar.

***“Those valuation multiples are based on a really overly optimistic earnings outlook,” Mr. Swenson said.***

***Another valuation model, the Buffett Indicator, compares the value of publicly traded companies in the U.S. with the country’s gross national product. As of the end of last week, a version of that measure was 29% above its historical average and above its peak in the dot-com bubble days of 2000***, suggesting that the market is overvalued. The metric was named for Warren Buffett, who once called the indicator “probably the best single measure of where [stock market] valuations stand at any given moment.” 

Two recent surveys have shown signs that consumers’ long-term inflation expectations are rising. Fed officials have said they would want to respond aggressively to signs that such expectations were rising, or becoming “de-anchored,” because they believe the process of wringing inflation from the economy will become far more difficult if that has happened.

1) ***For investors utilizing the passive strategy, none of this matters.***  The original plan was to DCA through thick and thin into the index, and none of this news alters that plan, at all.  Financial news like this is targeted towards people with an active component to their investment strategy.

2) One key theme in this article is that ***valuations matter***.  This time is no different.

CryptoCurrency,Tether: Greed and/or Fraud are the only explanations for the secrecy,"There's a lot of Tether defenders citing how they can't afford to play it safe and just invest everything in treasuries because they need to generate a return, and ignore that there's plenty of fund managers that offer funds with this strategy for far less money. To look at how Tether could operate if they functioned as a money market fund, strictly maintained a 1-1 reserve that was fully audited, and restricted their investments to highly liquid and safe treasuries, you can compare their results against Vanguard:

Vanguard's Federal Money Market Fund (VMFXX):

* Average Annual Return: 3.91% net return (audit and administration fees are already backed out).
* Vanguard Management Fee: 0.10%
* AUM: $207.4b
* Vanguard Annual Revenue: $207m

Now applying this approach to Tether, and assuming they matched Vanguard's returns:

* AUM: $70.4b
* Tether ""Management Fee"": 4.01% (net return plus management fee, as Tether keeps all investment profits)
* Tether Annual Revenue: $2,823m

So even if Tether played it perfectly safe, they would still make enough money to pay each employee $100m / year. Hell, they could just invest all of their reserves in Vanguard and still earn $2,753m per year while taking all of the risk off their plate.  

Looking at this from the outside, they've developed the #1 stable and could get rich doing borderline nothing from the investment side. This leads me to think there's only two reasons for their refusal to provide detail on their collateral or subject themselves to an audit:

* Reckless Greed: Instead of being content with a couple billion a year, they've chucked their collateral into high-risk high-return assets to earn 11 figures.
* Prior Fraud: They've already siphoned off a portion of the $70.4b in collateral and need high risk investments to earn this amount back.",cryptocurrency,1655298033

2. Rates hiked by 50Bps, announcing higher rates the following months.

A hawkish standpoint for following months will give a boost to the dollar making risk trade lower. Possibly shooting risk down, with a recovery followed by a continuation lower into the next months.

3. Rates are hiked by &gt;50Bps we would see a continuation to the capitulation on risk and a boost on the dollar price.

15 June 2022

Today the Governing Council met to exchange views on the current market situation. Since the gradual process of policy normalisation was initiated in December 2021, the Governing Council has pledged to act against resurgent fragmentation risks. The pandemic has left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy which are indeed contributing to the uneven transmission of the normalisation of our monetary policy across jurisdictions.

Based on this assessment, the Governing Council decided that it will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. In addition, the Governing Council decided to mandate the relevant Eurosystem Committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council.",finance,1655299848

We have some cash assets I can leverage to drop on the mortgage and also could probably get rid of a car if it was really necessary (we have 3 vehicles, one is my toy) to make this a more conservative deal. But I'm wondering if its ""good enough"" how it sits now. Thoughts?",finance,1655301348

personalfinance,"$30k in debt and family gifted stock to ""help"" - what do I do?","Over the last year, I went from having $20,000 in savings to $30,000 in high interest CC debt. A lot of this came from the fact that I moved my entire household 2200 miles to start a PhD program that didn't end up working out, so less than a year later I made the same trip home. We also lived in a foreign country, where the exchange rate meant that we were earning less in USD. 

We own our own home, which is wonderful, except we rented it out when we were gone and when we returned we found so many repairs that needed to be done. (Yes we had a property management company. No I was not happy with them at all.) We live in a very hot climate, and our windows are 30 years old. They're currently foiled over because they don't block any of the heat and we can't afford to have them replaced. 

Because my credit score has taken such a hit and I have wealthy family members, I asked them for help before trying to get any type of loan. Instead of giving me cash or offering me a loan, they gifted me 150 stock of a major company. However, the stock market isn't doing well and the stocks are worth the least they've ever been worth since this company has entered the market. 

I don't really know what to do here. I feel like I should hold on to the stocks, my family member says they used to pay really good dividends but then covid hit and it stopped. I also don't know how I'm going to dig myself out of this debt hole. My spouse has applied for a home equity loan, and that would take care of the high interest credit card debt, but it's been a month and we still haven't been accepted, which seems like a bad thing.

I am disabled and cannot work right now.  My spouse makes enough to keep us afloat, but is planning on going back to school in the fall with hopes of moving into the tech industry.

Do I just hold on to the stocks and hope that they go back up? Should I apply for a personal loan and try to get lower interest rates? Does it make sense to take out another credit card and transfer the high interest debt onto 0% APR for 18 months? I feel like we're drowning and I don't see any way out.

Over Twitter, he said the Fed will have to lift rates eventually to between 5% and 6%, and that it was “hopium” to expect that taking the federal funds rate to 4% would be sufficient.

In late May, Ackman said his Pershing Square fund had already a monetized a “chunk” of a derivatives bet shorting short-term Treasurys, for a profit of $1.4 billion. The more rates rise, the worse short-term Treasurys perform. Markets have almost completely priced in a 75 basis point hike from the Fed, after the last inflation report showed a 8.6% year-over-year rise in consumer prices, and a report in The Wall Street Journal suggesting the Fed could raise rates by that amount.

personalfinance,Making Risky Home Purchase,"We are in Utah, where the house market has been particularly hot. For instance, my siblings purchased homes for $230k in 2019 that are now selling for $525k. 

Earlier this year, we committed to purchasing a home through a builder and it is expected to be finished this November (2022). It is a small starter home but priced at $520k, and when we originally committed it was going to be $2.8k/month with the interest rate. Today we looked at interest rates and it’s $3.5k. 

Our household income is $112k, and we are very stretched at this price especially with everything else at inflated costs. 

We are not sure if we should buy the home yet, and just wait out for a market crash. But we committed $8k already so we would lose that to the builder. We are also concerned that if we buy the home, and afford it only with renting one of the 3 rooms, and then we have a market crash and lose $50-100k. I know in the long scheme of things we don’t lose this actually, but if we waited a year and was able to actually afford it it would be great. Also we wouldn’t be able to move out of the home until it has gone back up so we could be stuck and be delayed on having kids. 

There is also a concern that if we don’t buy the home, that there is no crash because we don’t have an issue with subprime lending and with the amount of homes purchased as investments for renting or Airbnb. Then we just have to pay more later on. 

Please share your take so we can weigh our options. Thanks!",finance,1655308594

So I changed jobs a few months ago and rolled over the 401k from my old job into an IRA I control. I'm an IT contractor and change jobs somewhat frequently and like control over my money.  Anyways I used the app to upload the check into my IRA account. It took a few tries beauce it was having problems with the image of the check. It finally worked and got the money pretty quickly. Cool, as soon as I see it clear I used all of it to buy into the targeted date fund in my IRA. Don't think anything more of it till a few weeks later, I check again and the money is still in the money market side of the account. I check the transaction history and the shares I bought went through and the money is still there. Weird! I call the company I use and the lady said it looked like 2 checks were deposited. I said nope, just the one. She mentioned someone else on her side looking at on the back end. Shouldn't that not be possible? Like is there no validation on these things? What's to stop everyone from depositing the same check over and over? Also it's kinda driving me crazy seeing a large chunk of cash sitting there. If they don't clear it or take it can I use it to buy more of the targeted date fund? It seems like that is probably when fraud happens, but I've called to report it and it doesn't seem like anything is happening?

inflation,My Critique of Ben Bernanke's Op-Ed,"Ben Bernanke recently wrote a guest essay in the New York Times where he compared the current inflation situation to the 1960s and 1970s inflation episode, which he called ""The Great Inflation"". Mr. Bernanke explained what he saw as the differences and similarities to our current inflation, and how we are ""almost certainly not"" going to repeat that experience. 

His argument seems to hinge on two points:

1.) The Fed currently has much more policy independence than it had in the 1960s and 1970s, so they will be able to do their job more effectively without presidents or Congress trying to meddle with their mandate, and;

2.) The American public has more confidence in the Fed keeping long-term inflation rates down, which makes us less vulnerable to a wage-price spiral which would keep inflation higher for longer. 

With regards to the Fed's independence, I think that the Fed hasn't seen pressure from the President or Congress lately because their policy has been historically accommodative. The Federal Funds rate is at an almost all-time low while inflation is at 40-year highs. Back in ""The Great Inflation"" as Bernanke is fond of calling it, the Federal Funds Rate was between 4% and 8% during the times when the Fed and other policymakers butted heads. As interest rates rise, and the economic stakes rise, I don't know if we can count on the better angels of the President and of Congress to continue to respect the Fed's mandate. 

As far as a wage-price spiral, we have a very strong labor market, and those labor market participants aren't going to not ask for compensatory raises to offset inflation because they believe in a vague way that the Fed is going to reign in inflation. They are more concerned with paying their bills now -- and with two job openings for every job seeker right now, employees are in the catbird seat for compensation negotiations. Ask yourself: would you be happy with a 3% raise this year?

CryptoCurrency,Why bitcoin crashes? Explaination for noobs,"Why Bitcoin crashes ?explaination for all noobs

If you understood market making and gme saga you can clearly see how market making can suppress an asset price for years despite exuberant demand. Can you believe there are not even 19 million people with money in this world with 8 bill people world who can’t afford the greatest asset in the history of humanity which they even wanna keep forever at 20 k a piece even just as a souvenir/artwork? Heck ya even a used car these days costs 20 k $. The answer is there are more than 19 mill people but all these people don’t have unlimited money when compared to a nation state with printing press. So when a nation state want to suppress bitcoin  price cause they don’t like people controlling their own money they first make market makers naked short sell bitcoin via forcing them by fear regulation licensing etc and crash price create fear and panic. people with limited money then stop buying most will sell at such low price out of fear which then market maker use to cover naked shorts. This especially works when liquidity of money is already drying like today due to Fed raising interest rates which again works under nation state. Then they also micro manage individual accounts in exchanges with paper bitcoins suppressing price until more people start withdrawing to their cold storage and they have no choice but to bring the price where they can again start the same process. Rinse repeat. The problem with bitcoin unlike stocks paper gold for them is you can actually own the real asset by taking custody and when sufficient people do that bitcoin skyrockets again. Halving again puts tremendous pressure on these market makers or govt to raise price else they go burst. This is how a nation state or an anti bitcoin agency works to delay the eventual mass adoption as much as possible and avoid hyperbitcoinization and collapse of the old system. Hyperbitcoinization for maxis and bitcoiners will be great but it will be very sad end for all nocoiners. Many of them are not going to make it including their families kids. Hence this strategy is applied by nation states now to delay or slow the process of bitcoin adoption. By doing this they are hoping to get either of following outcomes. Either something breaks in bitcoin code etc and it goes away in its own or by delaying this they get to find ways to attack software crack it etc by quantum etc (which again is impossible as bitcoin code itself will be upgraded to quantum resistant etc ) and kill it or at the least grab most of the bitcoins before common people before the eventual bitcoinization of the world. Bitcoin has and always will be attacked from all fronts and everytime it has and will come out stronger. Why? Because it is a technology an idea that never can be killed. Just like internet , cars etc that solved human problems. This time too bitcoin will come back even stronger . If you think Satoshi was a genius or an alien then he himself believed 20 years is the minimum time needed for bitcoinization of this world. We are in year 13 just over halfway!

Given my situation and the current economic environment I am curious if it makes more sense to prepay my mortgage vs. invest in a passive ETF / index fund.

- Interest rate on house is 3.5%

CryptoCurrency,The Federal Reserve just raised interest rates by 0.75%. Here's why that's terrible for crypto.,"The Federal Reserve just raised interest rates by the single largest amount since 1994. 

Why is this bad for crypto? Because since it's became popular recently, crypto currency is now heavily correlated with regular public markets, and specifically bitcoin has a 0.9 correlation with the NASDAQ. 

In public markets, as interest rates rise, the increased cost of borrowing strips valuations from growth companies, because a lower cost of borrowing prioritises companies who are expected to become big in the future versus the here-and-now. Cryptocurrency returns are very much linked with the unprofitable tech-growth firms that have seen massive valuation increases over the past 5-10 years.

Now this announcement isn't fully unexpected. Ever since the inflation print came out higher than expected last week, markets have priced in a very large rate hike as well as possibly more rate hikes to come in the future. This is the main reason why crypto has been down bad recently.

You see, the markets aren't moved by you and I anymore. They're moved by massive institutions with millions invested. And to them, crypto is a risk asset much like growth stocks, but they're the biggest risk asset they've possibly ever taken on. So when investors become bullish, crypto is the first thing they're going to strip from their portfolios.

So when people talk about this being the bottom, please understand that we are in a completely new environment economically than we were just a few months/years ago. We could see crypto at depressed valuations until the end of this current hiking cycle - which may take years.",cryptocurrency,1655316845

CryptoCurrency,Why Corporations should be starting to consider Crypto and take an early advantage of the next adoption cycle.,"As an investor, what I often find striking when looking and company accounts is the number of corporations that routinely and long-term hold chunky sums of operational cash on account, typically I would suggest it's used an operational buffer and many often don't come close to depleting it by 70% annually leaving 30% uninvested at the bottom.

This is true of many and seemingly even through times of hardship. With (despite rate increases) still historically low interest rates I've long thought that even just a 10% diversification away from 100% cash in to still highly liquid crypto assets would be a very sensible consideration.

Many corporations that have surplus and slowly eroding long-term cash reserves, recieve little or no interest from the banks, let alone interest that remotely keeps pace with inflation never mind beats it.

Some of companies, particularly the tech savvy businesses will have most likely been looking over with interest at the likes of Tesla and MicroStrategy adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a long-term inflation hedge.

Undoubtedly the argument against Crypto being any sort of short-term inflation hedge has been lost and certainly the fact it's a volatile asset class has been proven. 

However what is still true is that over time major cap crypto has proven itself to be an exception inflation hedge on the long-frame and trend of instructional acceptation and adoption still seems highly likely to continue despite downturn across markets which isn't restricted to just Crypto. In a way the correlation between Crypto and US tech stocks (which dominate much of the largest market in the world) should actually be reassuring as we all know that the government can't afford to let things get too out of hand without some sort of fiscal intervention. 

What is also becoming increasingly likely is that inflation will most likely not be transitory as first predicted by central banks rather prolonged and embedded. This will guarantee to erode surplus cash reserves further.

This current circular crypto correction is an ideal opportunity, not to immediately invest but at least to bring crypto back in to the boardroom as a potential possibility to allocate a small percentage of surplus cash in to a less liquid/ higher risk return asset class as part of a diversified strategy.

You only have to look as far as Coinbase for an example of a corporation that's not only survived crypto for 10 years, including 4 Crypto winters... but also thrived. 

Currently [37 Public companies](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/) hold 268,271 bitcoin.
 
As I type Bitcoin is currently not far from its previous Dec 2017 high.. winding back the price almost 4.5 years. In the past 5 years Bitcoin is still up 685%.. 137% annualised will little maintenance/ upkeep costs. 

Tesla reportedly paid and average of $34,200 per BTC, MicroStrategy $30,700 and Square $27,407

Just now Bitcoin is sitting at $20,653.80, this is a 25-40% discount compared to these early movers. 

When you compare what El Salvador paid for theirs ($45,171.) its an almost 50% discount. 

BTC and ETH make up 60% of the crypto market so I think it's also plausible to consider ETH as well, particularly with the added bonus of yielding staking rewards. However I can understand those looking after the merge is successfully complete.

**TDLR**

I believe corporate crypto adoption will continue to be a major trend of the next crypto cycle. Even in trying times many companies are holding sizeable 100% cash buffers. Much of expected inflation rates of 10% will become prolonged and ingrained instead of transitory crippling cash.  BTC is  25% to 40% less than other corporate first movers bought in. Over the next few months, boardrooms should really at least consider/ look at taking  advantage of Bitcoins 137% annualised gains over the past five years. Even just a 10% diversified stake in fairly liquid crypto instead of 100% cash.",cryptocurrency,1655317204

[Full Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/ceos-of-gm-ford-and-others-urge-congress-to-lift-ev-tax-credit-cap.html)

DETROIT – The CEOs of General Motors, Ford Motor, Chrysler parent Stellantis and Toyota Motor North America are urging Congress to lift the federal government’s cap on the number of vehicles that are eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500, a move they say will encourage consumer adoption of the cars and trucks.

In a joint letter Monday to congressional leaders, the executives say the credit, which begins phasing out once a company sells 200,000 plug-in electric vehicles, is essential to keep the vehicles affordable as production and commodity costs rise. 

For years, GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives with the Detroit automaker have urged that the cap to be lifted to create a level playing field. They say the current policy penalizes early adopters of the technologies. 

“Eliminating the cap will incentivize consumer adoption of future electrified options,” the letter states.",finance,1655317841

personalfinance,Should I respond to this collection letter?,"Hey all, yesterday I received a bill from Transworld Systems (TSI) about a debt that I am 99.999% sure doesn't belong to me and am wondering the best way to handle it.

A couple things to note:

It says that this is a debt from a ""FedEx Corporate Services Inc. Account"" and lists an invoice number. I don't believe I've ever setup a FedEx Corporate account. I did register a personal online account with FedEx roughly 10 years ago but never use it and see that I haven't logged into it since 2013. I am 99.999% sure that I never signed up for any paid service through FedEx so I shouldn't owe them anything, and even if I did it wouldn't have been a corporate account, I've never owned or run a business.

The other thing is that the bill from TSI doesn't list my, or my wife's names, just our address. Is that standard practice for privacy reasons? Or do they actually not have our name?

One of the reasons I'm hesitant to respond is that we're right in the middle of the home selling/buying process and both have impeccable credit. I'm nervous that if I call them and provide my name or phone number that it will essentially ""link"" me to this owed debt, even though it isn't mine. Sorry if that's a super ignorant concern I've never had to deal with debt collectors before so I am totally in the dark here.

There are some options at the bottom of the bill to dispute the debt and/or request for them to send me the name and address of the original creditor. I could just write them back and not put any identifying information on the return address of the envelope...?

Any thoughts or guidance is greatly appreciated!

Thank you!",finance,1655318209

personalfinance,I've got a big chunk of change coming in AND debts to pay: what do I do with my money in today's economy?,"Hey all! I'm in a situation where I'm going to have to make some choices on finances soon and looking for guidance/thoughts :)

Situation: I'm 32/M, live in Connecticut, am partnered but unmarried and we live together. I make about $75k with my W-2, my partner makes around $100k and our finances are mostly not entangled (we share one CC for common expenses like food/utilities that we split 50/50 each month, and also split rent 50/50). 

I invest(ed?) in real estate and am selling the last property I own next week, so I'm going to be walking away from that sale with $90k in profit. 

So with that, my assets are around $150,000 (or really $125,000 cash):

* \~ $35,000 in savings 
* \~$25,000 in my 403B retirement account (I contribute weekly and my employer matches).
* \~$90,000 in profit from this RE transaction

My debts, then, are around $161,000 (or really $96,000 after loan forgiveness): 

* \~$26,000 renovation loan (not a great interest rate, definitely paying this off once my RE transaction closes/I'm paid to close this out - this was used to renovate the property I'm selling)
* \~$70,000 in private student loans
* \~$65,000 in public/federal student loans (I've paid about 100 out of the 120 payments I need for PSLF, so this will be discharged by early 2024 assuming I continue working with my employer and make payments (or in the case of the delayed repayment pause, not)

(I don't have any credit card debt, car loans, etc.)

The real reason I wanted to sell this property (other than taking advantage of the market) was to pay off my private student loan and be debt-free moving forward (with the exception of my public loans, which I am obviously not going to pay more than absolute minimum on); HOWEVER, I'm wondering if it makes sense to actually hold onto most of that $90k so that I keep about \~$15-20,000 in an emergency safety net savings account (very don't-touch-this-unless-jobless-and-broke), pay off that $26k construction loan, and then still have nearly $80,000 to play around with that would sit in a savings account for the time being. The reason why this option is calling my name is because from what I'm seeing/hearing, it feels like there's a recession looming in the very near future and we're looking at a correction - if not crash - in the real estate and stock markets, and I would love to be in a place to take advantage of that and buy up stocks and/or real estate when they are cheap. At the same time - I've had this private student loan debt for basically a decade, and I feel like it is HAUNTING me. Especially as a young investor, my DTI is always biting me in the ass because of my student loans - even when I've got good history/experience in REI and stable W2 income. I want it to disappear, and if the best decision is to pay that off and move on with life, I can accept that. And in that situation, I'll still be sitting on a bit of savings - and if I don't need that or can continue to grow it over the next year, I'll still have SOME money to invest (even if it's only $15-30k).

I'm also not sure if this is the right forum for this question, but I'm nervous about my 403B and wondering if it makes sense to move my self-decided risk-heavy portfolio into a stabler investment for the next couple years and just accept that if the market jumps I might miss taking advantage of that, but if it tanks, it won't hopefully hurt me as badly anyways... I'm truly lost on this though and barely understand how stock markets/retirement accounts work, so I'm preparing to just connect with the financial advisor for the company anyways.

**I guess my TL;DR is: I've got around $90,000 coming in and can either pay off my private student loans or hold onto it and use that liquid cash to invest if we do go into a recession in the next year - and I don't know which option to choose!**

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin can have ""inflation"" without Bitcoins being minted","Inflation or interest are two opposites of one coin. It is the difference between the two that matters.

The difference is the effective interest rate = interest rate - inflation rate.

For the moment, money was printed with practically zero interest rate. The effective interest rate is therefore negative. Your bank account balance stays the same but the loaf of bread becomes more expensive. It's the same thing when your bank account has a negative interest rate chipping away from your saving and the loaf of bread keeping the same price.

The same thing is happening with Bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin is decreasing but the number of Bitcoins in the market is the same. I need more sats to buy the bread now.

Let's not forget where the increase of Bitcoin price came from. It came from the same source where the stocks got their increase. It's the same reason. Call it stimulus check, call it money printing, ...

The price of Bitcoin got inflated the same way as everything else.

However, as a good news, this is where the difference between fiat and Bitcoin comes into play:

Governments have control over inflation and interest rate of their currency. They are tweaking the dials (maybe in their favour, maybe not).

With Bitcoin, no one controls inflation because there is none. And the interest rate will be based on the international free market. We should see interest rate for Bitcoin as effective interest rate that can also be negative. Maybe the market wants the interest rate to be negative? Who knows? And that translates to an effective inflation. But that's not the end of the world. Inflation happens! And it should happen. We can't have the good without the bad.

But, most importantly, the whole world decides if there is inflation. Not a government!

Plus, Bitcoin has the advantage to send money almost instantly to the other side of the world for practically free.",cryptocurrency,1655323440

We planned to move into a detached house in our ideal school district  before school starts. We are currently under contract for a new build in that school district. 

The loan is 1 year interest only during construction followed by a 30 year 5/1 ARM with a 4.25% rate that we locked in April. We are set to close in 2 weeks but have gotten nervous about the loan product given recent inflation numbers,  Fed rate hikes, and warnings of recession/stagflation. The ARM can increase by 2% per year after 6 years to a max of 10.25%. 

We will also be living in our current home with a mortgage during the build so will have 2 sets of housing expenses. We are considering walking away due to the economic environment and would only lose $1600. However, with the way rates are increasing and the current housing market, it is likely we will be stuck in our current home for at least a couple years if we walk away now and would be in one of the lowest rated school districts. I would also expect to have some major expenses (HVAC) within that time frame if we do stay. Further complicating this is the builder also offered to pay closing costs so we can have extra savings once we informed them we might terminate the contract.

We planned on this being our “forever” home (at least 17 years) and refinancing to a fixed rate before the rate changes but now that seems like an unreasonable assumption. The general advice I’ve seen is don’t do an ARM unless you plan on moving before the rate change. While nobody can predict the economy, is the 1970s-1980s stagflation with 15% mortgage rates really still possible? We would have enough emergency savings to weather unemployment for 10 months in a recession but the thought of the monthly payment increasing by a max of $1500 in 8 years is really weighing on us now. 

Any advice for this situation?",finance,1655324909

I am 33 and have made some questionable decisions over the years which I am trying to straighten out. I make about $100k a year, with a small bonus (anywhere from 3.5 to 7 grand - I mostly ignore this when thinking about my financial picture). I have no school or credit card debt. I own a 2004 Honda Civic with about 150k miles outright, insurance is around $100 a month, although I work from home. I put 8% of my income into my 401k and my employer matches 4% (this is the maximum). On top of that, they pay 5% of my salary into another special retirement pool. It's not exactly a pension, but it's sort of similar. I currently have about $15k in retirement, of course stocks have been performing poorly recently. I also have about $20k in cash (bank accounts). Not the worst financial picture, but far from the best in my opinion.

Here's the weird stuff.

I actually own a condo. I have 25% paid off and it cost $423k back in 2019. My interest rate was 3.75% and I was stupid and did not refinance when I could. Between mortgage and HOA fees, it is about $2100 a month. I rent it out for $1800 a month. I don't live there because I experienced something very traumatic (I was stalked) and I was desperate to get it rented in the middle of the pandemic. I am slowly recovering from that experience and may move back in at some point. \[Before I moved out, I rented out the spare bedroom for $900 a month plus half of utilities, so my living expenses were about $1350 a month. It is a HCOL area.\]

My new rent plus utilities will be about $1300 a month tops, plus the $300 a month I am losing on my condo, so $1600 altogether. But the studio I was in was costing me about $2200 a month. It is a ridiculous situation but I was terrified and had ZERO support (emotional or otherwise) from family and friends and did what I felt was best for my mental health and safety at that time. Now that I've come to my senses a bit more, I am looking to improve my situation.

So I am wondering where to put the extra $600 a month. I feel like either my emergency fund or retirement. I cannot move back into my condo immediately but I am thinking of doing so in fall of 2023. Thanks",finance,1655327181
CryptoCurrency,"Market Watch for June 13, 2022","Hi bros, 

This week the market will be anticipating the Fed Interest Rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed was expected to raise rates 50 basis points on Wednesday, however following the higher than anticipated inflation numbers last week, Barclays anticipates the Fed raising rate by 75 basis points this week instead of 50 basis points as originally planned. The Fed's increased hawkishness may be due to the perception that inflation is increasing instead of slowing down. U.S. Rate Futures priced in a 43% chance (up from 4% on Thursday) of Fed Raising rates by 75 basis points at the June meeting on Wednesday.

Following the worse than expected inflation numbers last week, the US Stock market sold off and finished the week on the lows with the Dow down more than 880 points on Friday and down over 4% on the week.

If I go that route, it would basically max out my Chase card - would that alone ding my credit?  On my Discover it would bring that balance down to about 25% of the credit limit so might they cancel each other out?

If I apply for a totally different 0% card I could *probably* get the whole balance transferred and find one with no transfer fee but that would open up a new line of credit, which would ding my score too.

None of the 79 tokens at issue are registered with the US SEC (United States Securities and Exchange Commission) or state regulators. As a result, token buyers have no access to the disclosures that come with the issuance of traditional securities, and receive at most a so-called “whitepaper” that, while describing a token, does not satisfy federal and state prospectus requirements, according to the case. 

Furthermore, these whitepapers are often supplemented by ads and social media posts that promote a particular token...

The lawsuit argues that the Coinbase platforms (Coinbase and Coinbase Pro) are considered “exchanges” under federal law given they perform the functions of a traditional exchange; bringing together buy and sell orders and use established and nondiscretionary methods to set the prices at which the orders are executed. 

The lawsuit looks to cover all persons and entities who transacted in any of the 79 tokens listed on this page on the Coinbase platform and/or the Coinbase Pro platform (between approximately October, 2019 and March, 2022).",cryptocurrency,1655328583

The op went on to mention inflation rates of 8.7%, quantitative tightening policies, mortgage backed securities bubbles etc 

There was the suggestion that weaker hands have predominantly come in to market since 2017.. that a train was coming the next day and that it should last until September.

Without saying outright the underlying sentiment of the posts was in essence that you should be taking all this doom and gloom on board and consider selling.. not holding.

The post was mass upvoted by the sub.

There's been no significant movement since the rate increase announcement.

This post isn't to suggest that the op or the post is wrong.. just to say who really knows what is going to happen short-term. 

If anyone could really could predict when to sell, suggest they'd have posted these words of wisdom back in November before the crypto market cap fell from $2.9tn to today's $900bn. 

Secondly, if you're reading stock market and macroeconomic updates news on a Crypto sub on Reddit and they transpire to be correct.. how much and for how long have professional investors already priced that in? 

There's a reason why HODL has been around and widely used in crypto for years.. because quite frankly no one knows what the fuck stock market is going to do, how government will respond, what fiscal policies they'll use.. let alone what all this means for crypto. 

In fact before this bout of inflation no one was really sure if crypto was even going to be an inflation hedge or mirror the stock market. This is literally the first time in history crypto a direct correlation has been drawn. It's worth pointing out that it doesn't seem to be all stock markets globally.. more specifically it just American tech stocks. 

Amazon could announce support for crypto tomorrow, Tether could implode, Brazil could publish a bill to make Bitcoin legal tender, Coinbase could go bust. 

MtGox hack, Silk Road, Bitcoin pizza, Bitconnect, Global Pandemic, Terra Luna, Tesla Bitcoin, El Salvador, China Ban, Doa hack, PayPal integration, Elons tweets, Poly Network Hack, futures Bitcoin ETF, Coinbase IPO. Bitfinex Hack, Russian War etc etc 

Crypto is a young and highly volatile asset class. Many factors both within the crypto space and outwith can have major short-term impacts on sentiment and price. 

""Time in the market, not timing the market"" is as true of crypto as it is the stock market.

There's a reason why major exchanges dedicate pages of their sites to DCA it's tried a tried and tested strategy.

If you're trying to time the market to buy in and out of crypto, you'll most likely lose fees, may generate tax liability and ultimately risk getting burner. 

No one knows whats ultimately around the corner on the shortframe.. particularly in crypto.

personalfinance,401k loan question on what happens if the market bottoms out,"Title is close to the whole of it. Information on 401k loans (as best as I can search) appears kind of dodgy. It \*looks\* like if I take out a 401k loan, the funds are effectively pulled from the actual account, and do not gain (or lose) any value. The cautionary tale is that if your rate of return is normally more than the interest rate you're paying (yourself), you're not getting the full value. So long as that much is correct, the question I have left is, ""What happens if the market goes south?"" - in total destruction where all market value goes to zero (nuclear case), what happens with the loan? Is it called in immediately? Does the IRS immediately consider it liquidated and then I have to sort out paying 60% tax on it?

personalfinance,is it possible to have my bank divert an incoming deposit before it hits my account?,"really hoping this is the right place to post this. 

i received a notice of fraudulent activity on my checking account on saturday and confirmed that it was not me. several charges were attempted, one was listed as pending and the rest were declined and never made it to my account. the card was canceled and i was told that the pending charge would likely fall off by tuesday, but that i should file a dispute if it did not.

today, i log into my bank account to see that not only did the pending charge go through, but a whole new fraudulent charge had posted on monday (two days AFTER the card was supposedly locked/canceled). this cause my account to overdraft, and now the fees are rolling in. i filed a dispute and the bank is investigating but in the meantime my account is hundreds of dollars in the negative. they said it would be at least 8 business days before a credit is applied to my account for the stolen money, and 2-3 days for the overdraft fee to reverse. and they tried to tell me the overdraft fees would continue to post as long as the account is negative, but i fought back on that one and they said that i would have a grace period while the dispute credit is pending. i also found out that my card had been added to someone's samsung wallet and the bank confirmed that they just decided to skip the authorization process.

the problem that i'm posting about here about is that my paycheck is hitting my account direct deposit on friday. frankly, i do not want to be held responsible for this negative balance that was stolen from me, especially considering the bulk of it was stolen after i was assured by the bank that the account had been secured. my employer has already sent out this week's deposits so it's too late to change my account info on their end. 

is it possible for my bank to divert the deposit to my savings account before my check gets deposited and is promptly swallowed up by this negative balance? is it just a matter of asking to speak to the rep's supervisor until i reach someone high up enough to sign off on this, or is this something that's just totally undoable?

personalfinance,"Leasing appears to be cheaper than fiance with an intention to buy, what is the catch?","I am always told that leasing with an intention to buy is always more expensive than financing, and the dealer's rate does suggest so. However, by playing around with the calculator on [Toyota.ca](https://Toyota.ca), it does not seem to be that straightforward.

For a Prius AWD-e, the breakdown for the 36 Mo. monthly amount, annual 20000 km with $15000 down payment is as followed.

|Lease|Finance|
|:-|:-|
|$109.76 6.19% Monthly 36 Mo.|$637.93    4.19%     Monthly 36 Mo.|

|MSRP $30,390|MSRP $30,390|
|Down Payment $15,000|Down Payment $15,000|

Assuming the lease and finance are approved as shown on the website, the total sum for buying comes out to be almost the same. With the rising inflation and interest rate, less monthly payment can earn me a thousand or two dollars by buying GIC alone, with a bonus option to back out.

Is there any catch in leasing if I am going to buy the car anyway when it ends?

investing,Would love some eyes on a sell or rent situation.,"Hi everyone. I would love a few eyes on this to get your thoughts on what you would consider best for my current situation. I'm going to be moving away from my current house (Property B) and am faced with selling it our renting it out. (This is South Florida- Palm Beach County) I'll give what I think is the relevant data and will be extremely grateful for those willing to offer their wisdom. Thanks so much for your time.

**Property A is a 3/1 SFH.** (Rented out. Great tenant.)

Current mortgage (PITI) is $1000. Rental income is $2200. After maintenance and income tax (which I estimate at $500 a month) my net is +$700.

Further: Currently owe $115,000 with 24 years left on an 5/1 ARM loan (still have 4 years left on loan before interest rate changes) that currently has a 3.09% rate. Could sale for $400,000 (a conservative estimate). Obviously, selling it would net me $285,000 (hardly any capital gains taxes since I lived in it 2 of the past 5 years).

**Property B is a 3/2 SFH with 2 offices**. (I am about to move out of this within a couple of months).

Current mortgage (PITI) is $1850. I spend $100 per month on maintenance. Rent would be $3300 per month if I decided to rent it out.

Further: I currently owe $275,000 with a 3.25% ***fixed*** rate. My realtor thinks that this could sell for $600,000. And I've lived her the past 2 years, so hardly any capital gains tax here either, giving me flexibility if I decide to sell one or the other.

Currently I'm leaning towards holding both as investments and renting them both out. Property management costs would be $0 per month as I would still be close enough to take care of everything. And I wouldn't be buying a new home, where I'm going with my job situation, lodging is taken care of. Thanks again for those of you willing to respond.

personalfinance,About to close on a construction loan. Should we try to wait out the housing situation?,"My wife and I started looking for a new home 2.5 years ago. We already own a house (still have a mortgage), but were looking for a larger, long term place to stay. We were in no rush and had a specific set of wants, but never were able to find a place. We decided after a year of looking, we would buy land and build.

We purchased the land outright and decided to build a year down the road once we save additional money to kick off the build. Well, that brings us to the past 6 months of us working to try and get the build starting as interest rates climbed and prices soared, which brings us to today.

We are going to close on the construction loan this week, but I am not starting to get cold feet. We're building right on the line where we would be comfortable with the mortgage at around 31% of our monthly take home ($8500).

My worry is that we are kicking off the build right when materials are still high and the rising interest has not had a chance to bring costs down. On top of that, by the time the build is finished will probably be when materials and housing prices decrease, which would be the same time we need to sell our house and use the equity for the additional down payment.

Essentially, we are building at the heights of materials cost and will sell our house for equity once the market has cooled down for less money for the down payment, while still also having a much higher interest rate. Is this happens, it could potentially bump our mortgage to 33%-35% of our monthly take home.

Am I thinking about this correctly, or is there some information I am missing to make it not look as bad as it seems? Would we be better to kill this process and hold off for a year to let things settle down? We have been in this process for 2.5 years now, at this point we just want to make something happen.

* Monthly Net - $8500

stocks,"My 1-2 Year Prediction: Inflation is going to collapse dramatically, one way or the other. This is not bullish for stocks, however.","I made the mistake of drinking coffee at night, so I decided to make what I think is a contrarian prediction? I welcome discussion and criticism (be nice, though!)

------

**I.** The Fed is going to overreact. It's not going to observe inflation falling dramatically until it is too late. Economic data is always lagging, and the Fed going to stand by its brisk pace as political pressure from Congress and news media ramps up. The Fed has a credibility problem--a *political* credibility problem, not a credibility having to do with its hypothetical ability to fight inflation. The Fed is going to manufacture a mild recession that brings down gas prices by curtailing demand: eliminate all the trees to stop the forest fire.

------------

**II.**  Prices are a powerful signal to markets; when there are severe shortages in food, oil, natural gas, metals/minerals, transportation, this sends signals throughout the entire market that that are huge profits to be made. What happens every time there is a bull run in commodities? It ends in a spectacular collapse as firms all across the world compete to extract the eye-popping margins. Oil is a highly competitive asset, that yes, depends on a longer-term cycle of capital expenditures--but I think global governments have it in them to fast-track production cycles if crises really get that bad. 

We already see this collapse happening in shipping prices, lumber, and trucking, for example. There are massive increases in capacity scheduled for 2023 in shipping. Refinery output will take a year or two to really increase, and crude oil is slowly starting to increase in production. The administration will likely start to make it easier for the oil majors to get oil to the market, to save its political skin. Consider the huge buildup of inventory last quarter for Target, Walmart, and likely Costco. Markets were told to make more stuff, and they did. Russia will run out of its own men to lose and tanks to get blown up by the end of 2023, easing pressure on agricultural markets at least. 

-----------

**III.** Sometimes, when talking about markets, we don't think about how it can change rapidly in fundamental ways that impact how production cycles even function at all. Remember all those scientists/companies saying we wouldn't have a Covid vaccine for a decade? How many billions of vaccine doses have now been administered in 2 years? In a time of crisis, my bet is that humanity figures this shit out. What did we do when toilet paper ran out? We built more. What will humanity do when the cost of energy goes to the skies? It will adapt. Consumers will drive less, hold more work remotely. Car pooling will increase, as will public transportation use. 


-----

**IV**: Long term declines in population growth, aging will also be deflationary in the long run. But that's a bit too long term.

-----

**The notion that we will have a long-term elevation in inflation is inconsistent with global markets and profit incentives. It requires an absence of human innovation and adaptability.** We will not have inflation forever, and more likely than not, it's going to fall in a mild (or worse) recession and a glut of inventories arriving as that demand eases. My prediction is that by year end or early 2023, we will start to see news articles worrying about the Fed going too far.

**Connection to stocks:** For this reason, I think basing your portfolio off of the expectation of elevated inflation is a mistake unless it's very short term. Inflation can disappear as fast as it appeared. So being 80% in commodities, shorting bonds, etc. is a very very risky bet.

I think a good TL;DR for my message is: **the medicine for high prices is high prices.**",finance,1655348691

I also am a key player at the lab I'm currently working at. So, I'm sort of split on what to do; keep working hourly or take on an additional commission-based salary.

I'm asking because I'm in the process of buying a house and I was not forced but talked into getting a 7/6 ARM (5% down 485k price with a 5.375 rate), I have a pretty high-risk tolerance so the savings the ARM is offering I believe will be worth the risk in the meantime. This was a pretty rough time for me to buy a house in Vancouver WA. Luckily, I locked in a lower interest rate last month the fixed rate was 5.875 before the hike to 6.2 this week (my credit score was 710, I'm only 23....)

I'd like some opinions not financial advice, on the topic above. Also opinions on what fixed rate mortgages will look like in the next 7 years would be appreciated, is it possible interest rates will climb to the levels in the 80s or is it not possible due to the inflation taken place in the past 40 years? Life is throwing me a curve ball and I'm starting to get worried, I'm trying to stay level headed and calm.

Thanks!

personalfinance,When to pay off medical and student debt?,"I have about $2,681 in medical debt collections from being admitted for suicidal thoughts.   The reason why it was never paid off was because my parents told me that it will eventually fall off and I don’t have to worry about it.  What they didn’t tell me was how important it was in regards to credit and that it takes 7 years to fall off your credit report completely.  The debt has been confirmed with my hospital and they want me to pay in full with no payment plan option for it to be removed off my credit report.

I’ve been wanting to build my credit since finding out last year.  Been denied for secured credit cards from my bank and discover so I figured I should just get it taken care of. I’ve recently graduated college with about 8k in student debt (all federal so they are in grade period as of right now) and have a total of 10k in savings from working through college semesters.

I was lucky enough to find a job in a big city I’m moving to that’s paying 75k with the rent being 1650 before utilities, insurance, etc this July.  My question is would it be smart to pay any of the debt right now?

If I understood right, paid medical debt will be moved from credit reports starting July.  Should I hold off or go on ahead and pay that? What about the student loans?",finance,1655350971

CryptoCurrency,Is the bottom in?,"A lot of people are calling for much lower and I’m very skeptical this is the case. It seems like a rehash of the 100k predictions but in the opposite direction.

Everywhere I read on this sub people are throwing out random low ball numbers based off feeling rather than data - and people who do cite their predictions based off “inflation is the highest it’s been since 1981 and a recession is coming” I guarantee haven’t actually looked back at what happened in 1981.

Also people saying the bottoms not in because the suicide hotline hasn’t been posted yet. Did you not see the Luna subreddit, or people talking about their Cro stake?!
Just because it’s not here right in front of your eyes it doesn’t mean it’s not there.

Obviously no one can pick the bottom, but there is a ton of data available to suggest where one might be.
You don’t bet on a horse based off feeling, you bet on it because you know it’s previous race history.

I also don’t think this “recession” is as bad as people expect it to be and this is rather a large correction in the wake of the last few years of green since the covid crash and all the money that was printed.
I believe the big one is still to come, but I feel we’ve still got one last big leg in before this happens.

I have formed this opinion from all the data I’ve trawled through, and I’ll explain why I think this is case below.

————————————————————

First off from a pure macro data point BTC is right where it should bounce - or bloody close to it, if it is to follow previous market cycles.

1. A BTC bear market low has never broken the previous all time high. Previous ath was 19.8K

2. In all previous bear markets the 200ma on the weekly has provided support and been a strong cycle bottom indicator (yes it has broken below down to the 300ma once or twice but this has always come with a very quick recovery).

3. The weekly RSI is the lowest it’s ever been of any bear market, which indicates BTC is the most over sold it’s ever been in its history.

4. BTC rainbow chat is now in the dark blue.

5. The fair value indicator has diverged massively with fair value now at 41.5K. Divergences this large at almost double the current price have strong bottom signal. Last bear market the largest divergence was half and this was right on the bottom.

6. Stock to flow - I know some people don’t follow this chart after the 100K predictions but it still provides valuable data if you take it with a grain of salt and account for diminishing returns.
The chart is now bright green, previous market cycles have bottomed when this has occurred.

7. BTC has hit the second lower logarithmic regression band. There’s still one more lower band at the 16K, but taking into consideration diminishing returns &amp; diminishing losses, the lowest band should not be touched just as the highest band was not touched at peak 2 years prior.

8. Fear and greed is the second lowest it’s ever been.

9. Finally on the weekly candle charts in logarithmic we have a rising trend line since 2013 that has never been broken.

There is still plenty more data suggesting this is the bottom but these are just a few of the main ones I have picked out.
Obviously there is no way to predict a black swan event, but the only one I can reference in crypto is the covid crash and this still didn’t break macro data.

———————————————————

Moving onto why I believe we still have one more large leg up before a recession.

A lot of people are citing inflation and interest rate hikes to be the catalyst of this recession. Inflation is the highest it’s been since 1981, and in 1981 people were claiming the same thing but what followed was quite different.

To have an idea of what might happen, you have to look at what has happened. History always has a funny way of repeating itself.

In 1981 inflation was very high, the stock market dumped, Iraq invades Iran and President Reagan was shot in an assassination attempt. But what followed was a parabolic rally till 1987 after inflation got under control, then a major global recession hit.

Today inflation is the same as 81, the stock market has plummeted, Russia invaded Ukraine., and all we need now is an assassination attempt.. on hopefully an old Soviet era dick of a leader 👀

As long as inflation gets under control, which I’m sure is in the Fed’s best interest, a scenario like 1981-87 can very well happen again.

My belief is a major recession will come in 2027-29 for a few reasons;

1.Unemployment is at an all time low, at least here in NZ. A lot of other western countries are also low.

2. Many large companies are posting their largest profits ever.

3. The banks have been extremely cautious with lending since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, so the average joe is not going to suddenly default on their debts.

4. The world is moving on from covid and supply chains are all starting to free up again.

Finally,
When we have large recessions that hit hard it’s because property gets effected too. And currently the property market doesn’t look like it’s going to crash anytime soon due to low unemployment, secure lending, landlords earning more on rent and housing still selling for record highs.

The property market is one of the oldest in the world and it’s what the most people have exposure to.
Mum dad and the kids don’t have stock portfolios, but they do have a mortgage or rent, and a majority of people are in this same boat. So that’s why when the property market crashes, everyone feels it.

And an interesting thing to note, just like stocks or any other market, the property market cycles too. Being a slower moving, larger market, cycles take a lot longer - about 18.5 years on average if you look at history, which would put the next big crash at 2027-28.

- 19 years ago was the 2008 recession.

- 20 years before that was 1987 financial crisis.

- 18 years before that was 1970, the early 70s a notorious period of economic stagnation.

- 17 years before that was 1954. The recession of the mid 50s

- 18 years before that was 1936, americas third worst recession of the 20th century.

- 21 years before was 1914, WW1

So in following this 18.5 year cycle 2022-23 is too early.


This is all obviously macro data and price can fluctuate short term in markets, but in the bigger picture I truely believe the bottom is now/very soon for both the stock market and crypto.

personalfinance,"Locked in my mortgage, and the lender sold the loan before my first payment, it went up almost $500 - what can I do?","It’s midnight here in Vermont, but i just got around to opening my mail. Bought the house on 5/6 and locked in a rate of 5.375% and an agreed upon $1329.93 each month on the 1st.

Before i even got my first payment i got a notice that the mortgage was transferred to “Mr. Cooper” part of Nationstar Mortgage, LLC.

On the welcome letter that arrived today, it claims “the terms of your loan are staying exactly the same”

But then it goes on to say the monthly payments are now $1,813.65.

This won’t fly. I barely qualified for the mortgage as it was, and if we hadn’t locked in a rate and it went up, my income to debt would have disqualified me.

My original paper packet given to me by my mortgage company i shook hands with plainly states:

&gt; my monthly mortgage payment is: $1,329.93 paid the 1st of each month.

My father doesn’t understand why, either.  I’m so confuse and a little scared, since I could swing $1330 but I can’t see $1813 working, or why it would change.

Any insight on if this is legal? Did i just get bamboozled with the old mortgage switch-a-roo? Is my original contract no longer valid?

Edit/update:

Thanks for the replies, my inbox is stuffed more than an oversized calzone. I’m trying to read them all.

Called Primary Residential Mortgage (my first lender) and they explained that indeed, my mortgage principle and interest is $1329.93. But nobody explained to me that this was not inclusive of a few things:

* county taxes paid quarterly, but collected monthly  
* water and sewage, paid quarterly, collected monthly  
* PMI, as i only put 10% down on a conventional mortgage  
* homeowners insurance, paid annually but collected monthly

I told them nobody ever told me this the entire time I was signing, but was reassured that $1330 was my one, out the door payment.  I went through all my paperwork and there were mentions of estimates on things mentioned, but no where was a line-item “you actually pay this” ammount, which is the $1800 ammount.  I voiced my displeasure in not knowing, as I just paid $30,000 down after everything, i’m not worried about the sticker shock. I needed the actual out the door price per month.

So it appears that my $1800 monthly is accurate until they reassess the taxes and escro at the end of August, and i may be getting a rebate.

Very frustrating that i had asked and was told time and time again $1300. What would have happened had I just mailed in the $1300?

I have a call to my new Loan Officer, awaiting confirmation on that new number but man, it just comes off as sneaky sneaky. I straight shoot on my bills. Having to dig around and ask what the actual check amount to cut just comes off as hiding something, as if i’m going to walk away from it all *after* the fact based on the difference.

Thanks everyone for the replies.

I also will be looking into the Homesteading program to see if I can lower my taxes, so thanks to those who posted that info.

Edit 2: there seems to be some confusion here:

Yes i read literally everything. Every document, email, voice memo, text, phone log, etc. every receipt kept. Every pamphlet, etc.

The original loan officer admitted that they did NOT get me the line item coupon of what I actually HAVE to pay, instead just a simple letter with the P&amp;I only.

Yes, i know there’s PMI, taxes and stuff with it. But going by the letter they told me pay $1329.93 on 7/1 and each month. No mention or breakdown of the overage.

The $1800 price is accurate. They just never got past sending me ever-changing estimates and instead omitted them completely on the “pay this” letter - i’m awaiting the call from the NEW LO to set up auto payments.

Hope this helps

Edit 3: i think i’m all set here.

Called the original loan officer. They admitted they didn’t send the correctly reflexted total to pay in my first payment letter. We went over all the items expected and it makes total sense. They apologized and no harm done; i still have 2 weeks before it’s due.

Some of the “line items” are dealing with an old-pokey town and county where things just run different (aka slower) - it’s very rural here.

In my budget sheet, i did have line items for things like home insurance, water and sewer, etc, on TOP of my $1329.93 for the mortgage. If i roll these together it comes very close to the amount Mr. Cooper is asking.

The confusion lies in when i asked every week for a “what when how much and where” to send my payment, was told officially $1329.93 which is what i was about to cut the check for in 2 weeks.  Knowing what I know now, i’m glad i made this post, read all the comments and made a few phone calls.

I appreciate all the entries. To the clown that Dm’d me telling me i’m a lazy pos that deserves what I get, and that I’ll be homeless by the end of the year…. Man.  Have a nice day, i guess

As far as the CD, it doesn’t look exactly like what many of you are telling me it should look like, but it does outline the other items. Again, I understand the concepts of taxes, PMI, escro and what not.  The confusion lied in what i was told to pay vs what the 2nd LO said I ACTUALLY have to pay.

The matter is cleared up. Hopefully this helps someone else out who nearly has a heart attack in the middle of the night when their mortgage payment appears to go up by 40%

Thanks, reddit. Love you all

Xoxo

Final edit:

Thanks everybody for chipping in. It was very confusing, i’m missing some paperwork that was not sent to me, there was a discrepancy in terminology of what a “mortgage payment” means vs what I actually pay per month, and it seems to revovle around this closing document that i never got.

I have a fresh copy coming, i have the money budgeted anyway as separate line items, which the “new payment” includes, so it makes more sense.

It took this thread and a night of panicking to figure it all out. Now I’m square. And my ducks in a row.

personalfinance,My partner and I are splitting up. I now have to refinance the house at over double the interest rate,"My partner and I bought our first home together last year. We've recently decided to split and I'm trying to figure out what to do about the mortgage. I paid for the majority of the home so it was agreed that I would buy him out should we separate. I, unfortunately, didn't realize I would have to refinance (it's kind of obvious now, of course. Many, many lessons were learned).

* I make $290K.
* Current Mortgage + HOA  = $4200. He currently pays $1700 and I pay $2500
* Refinancing at current interest rates will likely be $5200/mo
* I would likely rent out the first floor of the property (it's an old converted warehouse) for $1500-$2000 a month, which would bump up my monthly to \~$3200. It's definitely more than I would like to spend but I suppose it is what it is. My other monthly expenses probably total \~$1500 (food, car, gas, etc)

My ex and I are on good terms and he offered to stay on the mortgage for a year so that I could figure out what to do with the re-fi (I've heard rates are expected to cool down in a year or so). After doing some reditting I'm a little worried about the ethics of that; I don't want to put him in the position of being liable for a house he doesn't live in, even though I'm not worried about defaulting. I also don't want to take the chance of rates continuing to go up and being in an even worse position a year from now. Should I just bite the bullet and re-fi as soon as possible? Or should I draft up a contract with him stating I will refinance and remove him from the mortgae within 12 months?

**Edit**: I should note that the home is in the bay area, where it's hard to get into a home even if you have the money. Since we just bought last year, I'd also lose quite a bit of money if I sold right now (between the closing costs and the market softening and whatnot).

My DTI is 21%, I have been at my current job 6 months, the job before that 8 months, and the job before that 4-5 months. (I was jumping around “jobs” and now I have a career). I make approximately $43,400/year gross. We’re looking at a 2020 car for $20,000 as we’ve heard new cars are easier to get approved. Also anyone know approximately what the payment would be if I was approved? Going through a credit union and interest rates are 3.39%/63 months, 3.94%/64-75 and 4.99%/76-84 based on outside factors. Obviously they’ll be higher than that due to my low credit but just wondering if there are any lenders in here who can give me an estimate of my odds, I don’t want to apply if there’s a good chance I won’t get it as it will hurt my credit even more.

CryptoCurrency,Rate hikes are just a red-herring from Fed to retail,"This one's gonna be unpopular, but here we go.

I've been following [Uneducated Economist](https://youtube.com/c/UneducatedEconomist) on YouTube for a while now, and he seems like a pretty honest/decent guy who makes a lot of sense; he doesn't directly advise you to buy any asset (let alone crypto) and makes his content mostly free, unlike, e.g., Jason Pizzino and DAN, who sell freemium content on their websites. Of course, I'll always DYOR and recommend extensive DD before investing in anything, but I think the guy's underrated and very worth listening to.

Everyone's saying interest rates are gonna go up and the bear market is gonna last 12-18 months at least, so of course the same people who advised against timing during the bull runs are now advising to start putting cash on the sidelines. Here are my observations:

Suppose the government, whether the Fed or someone else, raises interest rates to 3-4% and thus manages to bring CPI down to 2%; at that point, the economy will be so bad that even THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF will be unable to pay its debts. If the US defaults on its debt, then it's pretty much all over for the Fiat system... America owes money to fucking everyone.

That leaves only one option, which is turning the printer back on to inflate away their debts. I'm not saying this will happen immediately, but I don't see them bringing CPI down to less than 5-6%. At that point, it's not a discussion of whether the US dollar will debase, but rather a question of how quickly. The US will still probably be the last to collapse -- Asia and Europe are more fucked than we are -- but it will happen in the end.

**Conclusion:** I think most of us in this sub can get on board with what I said, but after that, it's just fear that it'll drop lower. If you think crypto is going up in the long run, even if for no other reason than that Fiat is doomed to go down in the long run, but you're not loading up at this absolute fire sale out of fear that it'll dip lower, then you're trying to time the bottom... You're probably one of the guys who was ready to DCA when BTC was at $60K, but now that it's $20K, you're all of a sudden so fucking fancy that you'll wait for $10K? If you bought the top but now you're trying to time the bottom, then you're here for the money and not the tech, at which point you might as well just go to WSB where the memes are better.

It especially hurts me because I knew about bitcoin in 2015 when it was 200$. I had a lot of savings as a single air force lieutenant, putting most of my savings into stocks, mutual funds, and LOTS in precious metals. Bitcoin was just a side bet. I liked it because it was a non state controlled money. Rodger Ver emotionally said Bitcoin was a protest to the state and all of the children it killed in Iraq so I got a couple BTC as ""diversification"" into an alternative hard money. I had the gold/silver bug so I accumulated a lot more silver than BTC, because I had low confidence in the stock market.

However, I do want to see all the Asset Managers, Institutional investors, banks, hedge funds, short-term traders, paper hands, re-hypothecaters sell. I want more talk in the media that Bitcoin is going to zero. I don’t want these institutions profiting from Bitcoin’s future success. I want all the shitcoins that have some backing with Bitcoin to fail. Let Bitcoin drop to below $10k or further. Bitcoin won’t go to $1 million or more until the dollar crisis happens. When it does, allow it to be the greatest redistribution of wealth ever. It may not happen for decades so if you’re short-term, go trade meme stocks. Let’s let it go as low as possible now though to shake off those who are not committed.",cryptocurrency,1655376401

My thought process is to take 11k of the check and pay off the more expensive loan using the rest for a down payment on another vehicle, probably another Corolla.

I can understand that there MAY be some issues (supply chain problems, for example) that can cause ""things"" to be more expensive... but when you raise interest rates, its the consumer that winds up getting doubly screwed because now their existing credit expenses (and any desired future credit they make engage in) will wind up being more expensive.

So I guess my question is - how does making things more expensive help keep things from getting more expensive?  What is the formula behind this logic?",finance,1655381622

stocks,(6/16) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, June the 16th, 2022-

# [Dow futures fall more than 500 points as Wall Street loses Wednesday’s post-Fed rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were under pressure Thursday, putting the major averages to give up the solid gains made in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6%, or 500 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures shed 2.3%. All three futures contracts had earlier been trading in positive territory.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield resumed its massive June run on Thursday, reversing higher overnight. The 10-year yield was last around 3.44% after ending May at 2.84%.
*****
&gt; Those moves come after the Federal Reserve implemented its largest interest rate hike since 1994 on Wednesday. The Fed raised rates by 75 basis points, as was widely anticipated.
*****
&gt; “Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference following the decision.
*****
&gt; Stocks took a leg higher Wednesday after Powell said that a 50 or 75 basis point increase “seems most likely” at the next meeting in July, indicating the central bank’s commitment to fighting inflation. Powell did caution, however, that decisions will be made “meeting by meeting.”
*****
&gt; The major averages ended the session higher, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 both snapping five-day losing streaks. The 30-stock benchmark added about 304 points, or 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.46%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the relative outperformer, rising 2.5%.
*****
&gt; However, market sentiment appeared to sour once again Thursday as other central banks around the globe adopted more aggressive policy stances and investors questioned whether the Fed can pull off a soft landing.
*****
&gt; The Swiss National Bank overnight raised rates for the first time in 15 years. The Bank of England was set on Thursday to raise rates for the fifth straight time.
*****
&gt; “Central banks in Switzerland and Hungary hiked rates by more than anticipated (while Brazil hiked inline and Taiwan raised actually a bit less), continuing the trend of aggressive policy tightening globally (the BOE is expected to increase rates in less than two hours while the world piles pressure on the BOJ to defend its 25bp target),” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; “Meanwhile, gas prices are climbing in Europe as Russia dials back supplies further, creating increased inflationary pressures for the ECB. The combination of central bank tightening and upward pressures on energy costs is pushing yields higher around the world, undercutting equity sentiment,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tech shares moved lower in premarket trading following Wednesday’s bounce, with Tesla, PayPal, Nvidia, Amazon and Netflix all down more than 3%.
*****
&gt; “There is an astonishing level of tech selling right now,” wrote CNBC’s Jim Cramer in a tweet Thursday. “It is breathtaking to watch as sellers are sending the best techs down gigantically at 5 a.m.”
*****
&gt; Travel stocks including United, Delta and Carnival also took a leg lower.
*****
&gt; The major averages entered Thursday’s session down for the week and well below record levels.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both in bear market territory, down roughly 21% and 32% from their all-time highs in January and November, respectively. The Dow, meantime, is 17% below its Jan. 5 all-time intraday high.
*****
&gt; Rampant inflation, which is at the highest level in 40 years, has weighed on the major averages, as have fears around slowing economic growth and the possibility of a recession.
*****
&gt; Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson warned that the inflation problem won’t be solved overnight.
*****
&gt; “It also raises the risk of a recession because you’re bringing forward rate hikes even faster, and I don’t think it’s going to help the bond market,” he said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; Economic data out Thursday includes weekly jobless claims numbers, with economists surveyed by Dow Jones forecasting a 220,000 print. Housing starts will also be released, while Adobe and Kroger will report quarterly updates.

solar,"I'm looking at installing solar in the DFW area and I'm a bit lost, seeking advice","I live in the DFW area (Oncor is my electric provider) had looked at installing solar a few years ago, but financially I couldn't afford it. Now I'm in a better financial situation and can afford solar, but hadn't really thought about it in a while

My current Electric contract expires next year so I have been looking at new plans and was shocked at the price increases. I currently pay $0.08/kwh with no other fees so my electric bills are usually under $100, even in the height of summer my bills are under $120, but with the new rate plans my electric bills will, at a minimum, double when my current plan ends and if trends continue they might triple so I've been looking at Solar again

I've received a few quotes (see below) that seem reasonable but wanted some advice

The Sunpower Quote is the most expensive, but I have read very good things about their panels and warranty. The quotes from Solar SME and NRG have REC Alpha panels which again I have read very good things about. I don't know much about Aptos panels that Texas Solar Systems is using, but they seem to be above average, just not as good as RC or Sunpower, but they are much less expensive.

I want to make over 100% of the power I will use so that down the road, with panel degradation, I'm still making 100% of my power, so the Sunpower quote will need to be revised and will become much more expensive, so I'm thinking about the other 3 quotes much more

In addition to seeking advice on which system would be best I'm opening up another can of worms here, I have also noticed Net Metering is pretty much gone, If I'm paying for a solar power system to make 100% of my use and I still have large electric bills it's going to drive me crazy. so I have also been looking at adding a battery.

Texas Solar Systems offers a 10kwh Enphase IQ10 back up battery, the cost for it is around $9,500 after the federal rebate

so any advice on adding a battery and advice on which electric company I should be looking at for net metering would also be greatly appreciated

**------This Year's Stats-----**

38, Married, childfree

[Mint Snapshot and Net Worth History](https://imgur.com/a/7sqJbrl)

**Total Assets** = $1,480,017.08

**Total Debts** = $437,842.09

**Total Net Worth** = $1,042,174.99

**FI Goal** = $1.1M + a paid off mortgage. 

**Debts** =  353k mortgage at 2.500%, monthly expenses on credit cards paid in full monthly.

**Income** = My Income (\~190k/yr) + SO's income (\~230k/yr) + Startup (\~20k/yr). 

**Expenses** =  Average $9.1k/month over the last 12 months. There are a lot of 1-off expenses though. Without those the average is $5.9k/month.

1-Off expenses are:

* Recreational vehicle damage (cracked a spacer during a track session) $2k
* 3 Vacations (including the entire month of Sept) $16k
* Buying a pet + pet equipment $4.5k
* Federal tax payment $8k
* Post-Airbnb Livingroom furniture $6k

&amp;#x200B;

\-----**Other Details-----**

* The last year has been tough personally.  It's not really on topic for this community, but I'd give it a 3/10, would not recommend. I think we had an easier than average time over 2020 being remote workers and owning a home. Now I think the postponed stress and anxiety that was mostly borne by essential workers in 2020, is coming home to roost for us. It feels like work and the administration of life is ramping back up to ""normal"", but socializing and self-care has gotten much more difficult. 
* The startup was profitable last year, but not enough to warrant continued full-time effort. For most of the last year, I was the only full-time worker and starting around 6 months ago, I was putting in less than 10 hrs/week. Given that it was still profitable and keeping clients on very little time, I decided to Benjamin Button it into a side-gig. It was a surprisingly difficult mental exercise to feel OK with this, but I'm glad I did it because it was very lonely working alone.
* Consequently, I decided to go ahead and get a job again.  It felt like the fastest way to get the socializing and collaborative work that I want. It also would provide a good counterfactual to test all my new skills and philosophies. One of the justifications for the startup in the first place was that even if it failed it would be better than an MBA. So far this seems to be true. I've only been employed again for a month but so far it's been great.
* Around the same time, my SO made a job change as well. As happens in sales, outsized success is often followed up with outsized goals. Their last role went a bit too far and it made more sense to move on.  As every other job move, they got a huge jump in base pay and variable target pay.
* For the second time in a decade I've adjusted my asset allocation. As interest rates go up, I was feeling like there were better vehicles for the counterbalancing the coffeehouse portfolio style. I moved 5% of my bond allocation into stablecoin lending, which is making around 7%. I'm still getting comfortable with the risk profile. Obviously, the rates can change at any time so we'll see if this remains a longterm viable split.

 In an attempt to contain raging inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised US interest rates by 0.75 percentage points. And it’s going to keep on raising them till something breaks, says John Stepek. The **“Fed put”** is dead. Or at least, the stock market level at which the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, will intervene with the soothing balm of looser monetary policy, has been lowered substantially. That much is very very clear. If anyone had any doubts, yesterday’s monetary policy decision should have set them right. The Federal Reserve isn’t playing games anymore. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point. It’s now targeting a Federal Funds rate of 1.5-1.75%. When you think about how unthinkable that would have been just a year ago, it’s staggering. Most investors were quaking at the notion of a quarter point rate rise.",finance,1655385407
personalfinance,"I have two student loans (one variable and one fixed), and I can pay one of them off right now. What’s the best way to estimate payoffs with interest changes the way they are?","I have two students loans right now: a variable loan at 5.265% and a fixed loan at 8.39%. Very similar amounts and similar durations. I also have the money right now to pay one of them off completely. I assume the other will be around for a long time.   
  
I’m mostly curious about how the variable is going to be going forward and trying to better understand how the Fed’s actions will affect it. Is there a 1:1 ratio between what the Fed does and what happens to my variable interest rate? Or will it vary? For example, I see they are projecting the Fed to raise rates by an additional 175 bps by the end of the year. Does that mean I can expect the rate on the variable loan to increase by 1.75%, or will it be more than that? Variable makes me nervous right now, but is the increase really going to be worse than the 3.125% it would take to match the fixed? Just curious if anyone had any advice on how to project / calculate a variable in times like these.",finance,1655385533
bonds,Got my first treasury bills and confused. Help me,"I went into the auction on 26 week bills for 10,000 dollars. The price decided in auction was 98.908 per 100, and the interest rate 2.160%.  Accordingly today my bank account was charged 9,890.8

In 26 weeks what exactly will I get? Will I just get my money adjusted to full face value of 10,000 and that's all? Or will I get the adjustment to full face value + the interest of 2.160% on top of it??

If I only will get the adjustment to full face value, then what is the point of an interest being decided at the auction?? The 2.160% is NOT equal to the difference between the price I paid ($98.908) and the $100 I will get.

- The money would come out of my bank account and then whenever I decide to cash in on the money plus interest it would go back into my bank account. Is that allowed or would I have to create a bank account for all 3 kids to have the money deposited into ?

stocks,Bank of England hikes rates for the fifth time in a row as inflation soars,"LONDON — The [Bank of England](https://www.cnbc.com/bank-of-england/) on Thursday implemented a fifth consecutive hike to interest rates as it looks to rein in soaring inflation.

The Monetary Policy Committee voted 6-3 to increase the Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, with the three dissenting members voting for a 50 basis point hike to 1.5%.

The committee said in a statement Thursday that it will “take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term,” with the the scale, pace and timing of any further hikes depending on the economic outlook and inflationary pressures.

“The Committee will be particularly alert to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures, and will if necessary act forcefully in response,” the bank added.

The [pound](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GBP=) dropped against the dollar shortly after the announcement, but rebounded to gain 0.4% and trade above the $1.22 handle by mid-afternoon.

Policymakers face the unenviable task of bringing consumer prices back under control against a backdrop of slowing growth and a rapidly depreciating currency, while the U.K. faces a major cost of living crisis.

At its May meeting, the [Bank raised its base rate by 25 basis points to 1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/bank-of-england-hikes-interest-rates-in-bid-to-fight-soaring-inflation.html), its highest level for 13 years, but warned that the British economy risks falling into recession.

Since then, fresh data has shown that [U.K. inflation soared to a 40-year high of 9%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/18/uk-inflation-jumps-to-40-year-high-of-9percent-as-food-and-energy-prices-spiral.html) annually in April as food and energy prices spiraled. The Bank now expects inflation to rise to “slightly above 11%” in October, reflecting higher projected household energy prices following an expected further increase to the U.K. energy price cap.

Inflation is surging worldwide due to spiking costs of food and energy, which have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and supply fears in agricultural commodities. Supply chain disruptions and demand shifts as a result of the pandemic have also driven up tradable goods prices.

However, in its statement Thursday, the MPC acknowledged that not all of the excess inflationary pressure can be chalked up to global events, noting that domestic factors such as a tight labor market and the pricing strategies of firms have also played a role.

“Consumer services price inflation, which is more influenced by domestic costs than goods price inflation, has strengthened in recent months. In addition, core consumer goods price inflation is higher in the United Kingdom than in the euro area and in the United States,” the Bank said.

The [economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.3% in April](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/uk-economy-shrinks-0point3percent-in-april-raising-slowdown-concerns.html) after a 0.1% contraction in March, the first back-to-back declines since April and March 2020, and the OECD has forecast that the U.K. will be the weakest G-7 economy next year as higher interest rates, tax rises, reduced trade and spiraling food and energy prices hammer households.

The Bank of England’s move deviated from the more aggressive actions of the [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/) on Wednesday and the [Swiss National Bank](https://www.cnbc.com/swiss-national-bank/) earlier on Thursday. The Fed imposed a 75 basis point hike, its largest since 1994, while the SNB hiked by 50 basis points, which was more than the market expected.

### A ‘case study’ for central banks

Vivek Paul, U.K. chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, noted that the Bank of England was the earliest of its peers to begin the process of monetary policy normalization, and is now further along the tightening path while facing the most acute risks to near-term growth. This means it could serve as a “case study” for how central banks worldwide will react as recession risks rise.

“We think market expectations of future U.K. rates will ultimately prove to be overdone. According to the Bank’s own figures, recession is a genuine risk – and recent government initiatives to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis may prove insufficient to offset U.K. consumer weakness,” Paul said.

“Ultimately, the Bank has less headroom for hikes compared to the U.S.: the neutral rate of interest – that which neither overly stimulates nor restricts economic growth – is lower, and the country’s high debt-to-GDP ratio implies greater sensitivity of debt servicing costs to rate rises.”

Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management, said that with rising gas prices continuing to put upward pressure on consumer prices this year, all the bank could do on Thursday was “send a clear message” to other price setters in the economy that 10% price increases are not “an acceptable new normal.”

“It had to show it hasn’t gone soft on inflation, or in economic-speak to anchor inflation expectations,” Ward said.

“In our view, a 50 basis point hike would more appropriately have sent that signal. It’s possible that by acting cautiously today, it may have to deliver more further down the line.”

personalfinance,Car ordered months ago just arrived. Should we go through with the purchase?,"Hi folks. A few months ago, we put in a deposit on a new PHEV vehicle to replace our gas car. We have one other vehicle - an EV - but it’s pretty small given a 4 month old (we’re not having any more kids), and we essentially never drive the gas car because of the cost difference; electricity here is some of the cheapest in the country. The thought was to use the high trade-in value (i.e. what we paid) on the gas car and get the new PHEV at MSRP minus a federal tax credit.


Obviously the stock market has been tanking. The car just arrived at the dealer yesterday and we’re scheduled to pick it up on Saturday. I’m hoping to get some opinions on whether we should go through with it.


Facts:

* Old car: 2018 Volvo XC90 T5 (paid $36k used), new car: 2022.5 Volvo XC90 Recharge PHEV 

* Car cost: $86k ($78.5 after federal tax credit). $36k trade in, $31.5 down, ~$20k financed at 2.19% and will be paid off early. $3k deposit is already paid.

* Income: ~$340k ($230k me, $110k wife)

* Age: 34, wife 39

* **Assets:**

* House: 730k

* Retirement accounts: $583k

* Post-tax investments: $129k

* Cash equivalents: $91.4k

* **Debts:**

* $130k mortgage, 30 year at 2.75 (P&amp;I payment: $775/mo)

* Car payment for my EV: $48k @0.99% (would have paid cash but the rate was too good to pass up, purchased last year)

* Net worth: $1.47m

* Emergency fund (“cash”) now: ~15 months. If we purchase: ~10 months.


The new car is admittedly a little bit rich, but I’ve always been a car person and take very good care of them. It would be in a garage, well cared for, and still see &lt;10k miles per year of use. The intent would be to keep it for **at least** 10 years. We already know that we love the XC90, this just adds the bells and whistles and mitigates the gas use so that we’d actually drive it and have more room for baby and dog gear.


I’ve run the TCO numbers and in 5 years, the upgrade seems to cost $10-17k. There are too many unknown variables to be sure. I feel very secure in my job and employable if something were to happen to it. I think there’s a good chance that inflation will continue and that vehicle costs won’t come down much - especially for electrified vehicles. Still, there’s enough turmoil in the markets to make me second guess myself here.

stocks,"Teladoc analysis and valuation - Some love it, some hate it ($TDOC)","Teladoc ($TDOC) was one of the most volatile stocks in the last few years. The share price increased 10x from $33 (5 years ago) to almost $300 at the peak of Feb 2021. Since then, the price declined by 90% and is now back in the $30s.

I've spoken with quite some retail investors and it's so interesting to see the two opposing views. Some are very optimistic about Teladoc and expect the price will go back to the all-time highs. While others are expecting the price to go below $10 and are short-selling the stock.

The goal of this post is to share my fundamental analysis and valuation. Feel free to provide your feedback, add your own insights, and disagree with me :)

It is good to mention that the market cap is $5b, we can keep this number in mind when comparing it to other parts of the financials later on. Let's get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Teladoc?**

Teladoc is a global leader in whole personal virtual care. It is challenging the traditional model for hospital visits for non-urgent mattes and provides a new, more convenient alternative, that is available 24/7. It has been referred to as Uber for doctors. Patients can use the Teladoc platform to schedule online visits and connect with the right healthcare professional, whether that's related to acute care, specialty care, mental health, or wellness &amp; prevention (including prescription). Teladoc stores a significant amount of data regarding the patients that can be analyzed using AI and provide meaningful insights that can easily be used.

Related to the service provided through the platform, 92% of all issues are solved in 1 virtual visit and 1% are being referred to emergency care. This means the platform does a good job of connecting the patient with the right healthcare professional.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Teladoc make money?**

Teladoc has two main revenue sources:

1. Access (subscription) fees - In the majority of the cases, employers pay this fee on behalf of their employees ($14.99/month or $99/annually). This is roughly 85% of the revenue, which makes Teladoc mainly a B2B company. This is a subscription that allows the employees to access the platform and schedule virtual visits/appointments on their own. Hence, this is a pretty high-margin revenue.
2. Visit fees - Although the majority of the payment for the virtual visits goes from the patient to the doctor, Teladoc keeps a small % of it as a ""visit fee"". This is a lower-margin revenue and it represents the remaining portion of Teladoc's revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Teladoc grow?**

If we take into account the revenue sources, it is clear that Teladoc grows in two ways:

1. Provide access to more members and hence increase the access fees. - Teladoc has almost 55m paid members in the US and it can be argued that the US market is already highly penetrated with limited growth ahead. Of course, internationally, there's still room to grow, but there are plenty of other competitors as well and the rates are likely to be much lower than in the US.
2. Increase the # of visits which leads to higher visit fees. - The company publishes a so-called utilization rate, which is calculated as the # of visits divided by the # of members. This rate has increased from 17.5% in Q1/2021 to 23.4% in Q1/2022. Roughly 1/5 of the members use the platform and schedule meetings. I find this a bit difficult to increase significantly. The nature of the service doesn't allow the company to upsell/cross-sell, with the exception of the nutrition/wellness segment. However, that very segment is highly competitive in the first place and there are cheaper alternatives.

**Livongo - the elephant in the room**

Historically, the growth has come from a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. In 2020, Teladoc acquired Livongo and the purchase price was $13.9b (net of cash received). The fair value of the balance sheet of Livongo was roughly $1b, which lead to goodwill recognition of a staggering $12.9b. Of course, the majority of that purchase price was in the form of stock and at the acquisition point, both Teladoc and Livongo were significantly overvalued. However, let's not forget that the market cap of Teladoc today (including Livongo) is $5b, a lot less than the acquisition of Livongo on its own.

Livongo is also a company that operates in the industry, providing a device that allows the patients to measure certain important aspects on their own. They're mainly focused on diabetes management/prevention, high blood pressure, and weight management.

Fast forward to Q1/2022, Teladoc reported a goodwill impairment of $6.6b, roughly 50% of the goodwill initially recognized.

**Why was the goodwill impairment and what does this mean?**

Every company has to do so-called goodwill impairment testing annually. In a nutshell, the company needs to forecast the future cash flows that are expected to be generated from the acquisition, discount it to today and compare it with what they have on the balance sheet (including the goodwill). If the outcome is higher than what the company has on the balance sheet, then nothing happens. But if the outcome is lower, they need to impair the goodwill.

This impairment means that Teladoc forecasted the future cash flows and discounted them to today and the outcome was $6.6b lower than what they expected at the point of acquisition.

What is interesting is that there's still over $6b of goodwill related to Livongo only, so Teladoc still believes that Livongo is worth over $6b. The market disagrees significantly as it prices the entire company lower than what Teladoc is valuing Livongo alone.

Goodwill impairment is a non-cash expense, so although it is in the P&amp;L, it has no significant impact on the company's financials. However, it does raise two of the main risks when it comes to making big acquisitions:

1. Selecting the right company that will create synergy.
2. Integrating the acquired company into the existing environment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

If we take a look at the revenue growth, it increased from $233m for the full-year 2017 to $2.1b for the last twelve months (ending Q1/2022). Although it is impressive annual growth, a lot of that came from the acquisitions. The organic growth was close to 40% CAGR. The expected growth for 2022 is close to 20%, which shows that the growth is quite limited ahead (at least organically).

The gross margin is currently around 68% and depending on which revenue source contributes more, it could fluctuate in both directions. The main direct costs that are being incurred are fees paid to doctors, data center activities, and client support.

&amp;#x200B;

Operating expenses:

**- Sales &amp; Marketing** \- As % of revenue, it has decreased from 41% (in 2021) to 33% (LTM). That is roughly $700m and it can be argued that it might not be producing high RoI based on the revenue growth.

**- Technology &amp; Development** \- Stable at 15% of revenue

**- General &amp; Administrative** \- Significantly decreased from 34% (in 2021) to 20% of revenue (LTM)

**- Depreciation &amp; Amortization** \- Increased from 8.2% (in 2021) to 10% (LTM)

**The operating margin** has improved from -32% (in 2021) to -12% (LTM, excluding the $6.6b goodwill impairment).

&amp;#x200B;

**Liquidity**

Although the company's operating margin is negative, part of the costs are paid via share-based compensation, so the company's operating cash flow seems positive as this is a non-cash expense. However, this of course leads to dilution of shares. It is worth mentioning that it does help when it comes to the short/mid-term liquidity challenges in this environment and reduces the risk of bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

The goodwill remaining on the balance sheet arising from all historical acquisitions ($7.9b), together with the other intangible assets ($1.9b), and the cash ($0.8b) comprises 96% of Teladoc's balance sheet ($11.1b).

On the liability side, the most important topic worth mentioning is the long-term debt and leases, amounting to $1.6b (2x the cash the company has available).

The company is capital-light, so the focus should be mainly on the $0.8m cash and $1.6b debt.

&amp;#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value. The assumptions are listed below:

**Revenue growth:** 20% in the next 12 months, followed by 15% in the 4 years after that and declining growth over time to 3.41% in 10 years' time. This is in line with analysts' expectations for the next 2 years as well as the management's guidance.

**Operating margin:** to improve over time, to reach 9% in year 5 and  25% in year 10.

**Discount rate:** Currently 7%, increasing to 10.6% over time (as the fed is raising the interest rate)

**Outcome**: $38.77/share

\*Note: In the DCF calculation, the outstanding equity options are also taken into account as well as the deferred tax that they can use to reduce their future tax payments.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on my assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 208% to $6.6b in the next 10 years and the target operating margin is 25%.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) changes based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|150% ($5.4b)|$21.9|$31.0|$40.1|
|208% ($6.6b)|$27.8|$38.8|$49.8|
|300% ($8.6b)|$37.3|$51.3|$65.3|
|350% ($9.6b)|$42.5|$58.1|$73.8|

There is still quite some uncertainty ahead of Teladoc and it is clear that the level of success depends on the # of new members they can bring to their platform as well as the utilization rate. Looking into the two opposite views, I'm in the middle. I don't think that Teladoc will go down to $0 as there is a value that the platform is providing and I don't see a bankruptcy risk. However, I don't think that going back to the levels of $300 in the next few years is also reasonable (at least based on the fundamentals).",finance,1655396324
personalfinance,With interest rates on the high side what should I be concerned about before buying a home?,"I'm fairly new to reddit and don't post much. However I get a lot of useful tips especially from this sub so I decided what the hell. 



My wife and I are in the market to buy our first home. As wonderful as it sounds, the process has been quite the rollercoaster. At the time of me making this we have been saving for 2 years. We live in so cal. My total savings is at 40k and so is hers. I'm a software tester and currently make around 110k/y plus 10% bonus twice a year and she's not too far off from that. We saw a property that we love but with recent rates spiking up it has me hesitant. Our lender told us we would be paying close to 5k in Mortgage and taxes on a $700k property. That's just about 50% of monthly income which is way too high for my comfort but we need the extra space for my daughter (who is due any day now). My initial thought was to lock in the place now and refinance the moment rates go back down. Curious to know what you guys think. 



Edit:  I usually pick up a 2nd job as a IT contractor which usually brings in a couple extra grand a month. Also we currently live downtown LA and our rent is 3100 for 1 bedroom. Our lease is up at eoy. My guess is the rent will certainly increase if we renew. And we will still need more space sooner rather than later.


I'm in need of some advice, hoping you guys can help me out.  Thanks 🙏",finance,1655396738

Bitcoin,Stages Of Hyperinflation - USA is at stage #5,"There is a general pattern for the stages of hyperinflation. This can also be viewed as the stages of the ""death of a fiat currency"". Money can be seen as serving 3 roles. It is a medium of exchange, it is a store of value, and it is a unit of accounting. As we move through the stages of hyperinflation the money gradually gives up these 3 roles. Once it has given up all 3, it is dead.

1. Government spending gets out of control to where deficit is 40% or more of spending and debt is over 80% of GNP. If this is for a war that the markets believe will be won and ended so that the government can make drastic cuts in spending, then there is some wiggle room in these numbers.
2. This goes on for a couple years and investors move towards shorter-term bonds.
3. It becomes clear the deficit is not going back down.
4. The central bank starts buying up government debt with newly made money. If they are not naturally inclined to do this, the government changes the laws or people running the central bank. For the rest of this section, I will write as if the central bank were just part of the government and ignore bond certificates printed by the government and handed to the central bank as these will become worthless anyway. With this simplification, I will just say, ""the government prints money"".
5. There is capital flight out of that currency and bond sales fail. If **the government let bond interest rates rise to attract bond buyers, the interest payments on the debt would be huge compared to taxes collected**, so they keep interest rates down by printing more money. However, the private investors become less and less inclined to ""roll over"" their government bonds.
6. Government is forced to print money to cover their budget and inflation picks up. The more bonds coming due the worse the printing is. Many short-term bonds can make for huge amounts of printing, even more than the regular budget.
7. Some people notice prices going up and spend their money before prices go up more, even for things they don't need yet. The velocity of money picks up. People start to realize that the local currency is not a good store of value, though still used for transactions. Some people start to use foreign currencies or Bitcoin as a store of value.
8. So many people take money out of their bank accounts and exchange it for a foreign currency, or Bitcoin, or just buy something, which puts banks in danger of going under. So the government often freezes bank accounts. This is very bad for the account holders, both because times are hard and they can't get their money, and also because by the time they are able to get their money, it is worth much less.
9. Wages and prices become indexed to something more stable, like a foreign currency or Bitcoin. So the local currency is losing the ""unit of account"" function. Wages become paid more often, like weekly or daily, instead of monthly. The velocity of money picks up more.
10. People start to use a foreign currency or Bitcoin as store of value, even though the government may forbid it. The black market starts in currency exchange.
11. Interest rates are very high and loans are for much shorter periods. Loans may be for a couple months instead of 30 years. Hyperinflation makes for hard times and many people are forced to sell their their land or house. Because of these things the real prices for things usually bought with long-term loans can drop in terms of something like Bitcoin. Houses may usually be bought with a bag of some foreign currency. Real estate is very different during hyperinflation and normal times.
12. People start to use barter or a foreign currency or Bitcoin for trade, even though the government forbids it. This is a growing black market for commerce. If you trade a fish you caught for some potatoes your friend grew, neither of you is paying any taxes on the deal. In general, once people are breaking the law by using a foreign currency for trade, they don't pay any taxes on trade either. The black market is tax free.
13. Being tax free and with better store of value, the black market eventually grows larger than the legal market. People no longer worry about the government requirement to use local paper currency, enforcement is impossible.
14. A business that follows the law and sells for regulated prices in the local currency cannot buy enough new inventory and soon goes out of business. This makes the percentage of the economy that is black market go up.
15. People start to not want to accept the local paper money. Regular taxes are down because hyperinflation has devastated the economy and much of the economy is now in the ""black market"". The government is finding it hard to buy things by printing money, as so much of the economy has moved to the black market. It is finding it hard to pay employees enough for them to live comfortably, even though it keeps printing more all the time. The government is losing economic power. Tax collectors may be skipping work to tend to their own vegetable garden. There is a very real risk of the government failing at this step.
16. At this point, the government has some hard choices if it is not going to fail. It needs to do something so that the ""black market"" is legalized and taxable, and deficits are nearly eliminated. It could just legalize a foreign currency or Bitcoin. But then it would forever give up on collecting any ""inflation tax"". It could get rid of budget deficits and stop printing money. However, people will still fear that it could start again at any time and so be hesitant to use that money. I think the most frequent end to hyperinflation is by making a new fiat money but with enough governmental changes that bring deficits and inflation under control, people will use the new money. If they switch to a new currency then the old money is no longer used as a store of value, or unit of account, or even as a medium of exchange. It has died.",cryptocurrency,1655399621

personalfinance,Need some advice on next move with the equity in our home and leaving the military.,"Such an interesting time with my wife and kids.

JUST got out of the Army.  I have no employment commitment where I currently live starting next month.  We only moved to this area because of military.  Not a terrible town or area to live in, but its still an Army town.

My wife and I bought our home in 2019 for $250k.  Appraisals as of last month show the house at $440k.

We have around $12k in savings, and we currently have a truck ($300/month), and car payment ($200/month), credit cards ($5k) and misc debt, all with a total debt amount of around $45k.

The idea of selling our home and paying off all of our debt, while still having potentially $100k in our pockets sounds obviously really good on the surface...

We are currently locked in at 2.75% APR.  But if we sell and buy another house, the lowest interest rates available are at least double our current APR.  Not to mention I don't want to purchase a home in this market regardless of APR.  It's possible that home values could half or worst in the near future, but who knows.

My credit is hurt over a 30-day late that happened back in January and it is legitimately a screw up with my lender and despite my best efforts I am unable to get it removed, at least not now, so obviously this will hurt us if we attempt to buy another house.

We could rent, but our current mortgage is around $1350 and getting a smaller apartment (if we were to move) will command more than that.

Despite the military life I have a side hustle that consistently brings in $2-3k a month on top of military pay, but as of next week I will no longer be receiving Army paychecks.  My wife is a stay at home mom with our little ones, so she doesn't bring in income.

I do have full-time work lined up for me in Oklahoma, which would obviously require my family and I re-locating.  This job $3500 a month or so (not thrilling, but steady work).

FWIW, the Army will pay for our move to wherever as long as we move in the next 6 months.  I will even pocket on this as well most likely.

Kids are currently plugged in to good schools here and we have good neighbors, but all of these good neighbors will likely move in the future when the husband either changes duty stations or gets out of the Army.

I keep going back and forth on whether to move or stay.  The wife and I even talked about listing our own home (which we did in 2012) and saving $25k+ in realtor fees, but there is some safety and comfort knowing that we currently have a comfortable roof over our heads, despite the potential profit.    We live off-post in a military town, but don't necessarily want or intend to stay in this town for very much longer.  But we also don't have any clear vision or focus as to where to live now.  Southern California is our home but we haven't been back in years because of the military and I dont think this is the best time to move back there financially.",finance,1655402030

- Living in Chicago, IL, as an international student.
- I do not have a US driver’s license, but I have been a licensed driver for almost 2 years in another country (Colombia if that matters), and actively driving during those 2 years; according to state and federal law, I can perfectly drive with my foreign license for the time I am a student on the same terms as a US licensed driver.
- 0 accidents on driving record (at fault or otherwise).
- No credit as of yet, but I will get my first credit score in the next few months.
- Stable, although not very high, income.
- First time car owner.
- looking to buy a used car, all of the possible options are German made luxury cars between 10 and 20 yrs old, think B8 Audi A4 or W211 Mercedes E Class (yes, I know, but I already made up my mind and know what to expect from these cars).
- Budget for car: 3 to 10k USD, depends on car.

Taking into account all of the aforementioned, and according to your knowledge or experience, what would be the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM cost of insurance for me?

Veteran investor and bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz doesn’t have a rosy outlook on the economy, which he described as headed for a substantial downturn, with the likelihood of a “fast recession” on the horizon. “The economy is going to collapse,” Novogratz told MarketWatch. “We are going to go into a really fast recession, and you can see that in lots of ways,” he said, in a Wednesday interview before the Federal Reserve decided to undertake its biggest interest-rate hike in nearly three decades. “Housing is starting to roll over,” he said. “Inventories have exploded.” “There are layoffs in multiple industries, and the Fed is stuck,” he said, with a position of having to “hike \[interest rates\] until inflation rolls over.” Central-bank policy makers agreed to deliver an unusual 0.75-percentage-point rate increase, concluding a closely watched two-day policy meeting with a move that would push the Fed’s benchmark federal-funds rate rising to a range between 1.5% and 1.75% as it steps up the effort to quell an inflation rate that is hovering around a 40-year high.

(Bloomberg) -- A key source of US economic growth this year -- consumer spending -- is showing signs of losing steam, even before Wednesday’s round of Federal Reserve rate hikes kick in. Most Read from Bloomberg Credit card data show that spending in May was just 10% higher from the same month last year, according to a Barclays report this week. For the rest of 2021, that monthly spending growth has averaged more like 20%. That slowing growth, combined with weakening home sales and declines in wage growth, would mean that monetary tightening is already hitting the economy hard. The Fed may be able to tighten less aggressively in July, according to Barclays, which is forecasting just a half percentage point rate hike next month. Rates markets indicate a strong chance of a three-quarter percentage point hike. The stock and corporate bond markets don’t reflect the risk of a weakening consumer, wrote Barclays strategists including Ajay Rajadhyaksha, Ryan Preclaw, and Hale Holden, in a separate Tuesday note. The slowing growth of consumer spending underscores how difficult the Fed’s job is now as it looks to contain inflation that’s running at a four-decade high, while trying to avoid tipping the economy into recession. The softening only started in the last four to six weeks, but it was visible among both high- and low-income consumers, the strategists said, based on a sampling of Barclays credit card data. And it’s consistent with a report on Wednesday that showed retail purchases fell 0.3% in May from the month before, the first decline this year. “Like Atlas with the world on his shoulders, the consumer has been supporting the US – and, to a large extent, the world – economy all year,” the strategists wrote. “But that might be about to change.”",finance,1655404662

devops,DevOps Engineer Skills Matrix - What do you think about it? Do your company use it?,"What are the requirements for a DevOps engineer in your company? Do your company use the skill matrix? We've describe here our vision about what a DevOps engineer should know to be an expert and wanted to know your opinion.

So, since we understand that people come to companies from different jobs and all have a different scope of competencies and levels of knowledge, we decided to create a universal roadmap for the growth and development of a DevOps engineer. But it didn't work as we wanted, so we decided to go the other way and create a list of skills and competencies needed to work in our company.

Thus, having made a three-level system, each level consists of a questionnaire and criteria for the candidate. To put it another way, we prepared the first version of grading and certification.

However, this system also did not help to solve our problem. Later we found a great tool - a self-assessment skill matrix. We decided to put the tool into practice for DevOps and later transformed it into a skill matrix. After that, we held a session where we set ourselves current and desired six-month grades. We used Miro as a tool, but you can also use Google sheets.

# Skills and competencies

You need at least a middle sysadmin level to get started. Also, skills required for further growth and understanding of abstract skills and principles of:

* preparation and operation of the service in production;
* analysis logging;
* creating fault tolerance;
* disaster recovery;
* scripting and automation programming;
* configuration management.

## Linux

The Linux kernel, subsystems, and the utilities around it are at heart. What you need to know:

* Processes, devices, disk partitions, lvm, file systems, namespaces, and cgroups;
* Boot loaders, startup process, systemd, and units;
* Netfilter network subsystem, user utilities: iptables, Shorewall, tc, etc., basic knowledge of network protocols;
* Virtualization - primarily KVM, also need to know the types of virtualization and other technologies;
* How to set up and work with basic services: dhcpd, NFS, sshd, DNS (bind), mail (postfix, Sendmail), web (Nginx, apache, caddy, traefik, etc.), database(MySQL, Postgres);
* Basic bash/python scripting;
* Basic troubleshooting.

## Docker/Containers

Even though Docker is leaning back, we cannot exclude it from the list of necessary skills. It is difficult to imagine anything else for local use for several more years. If we talk about k8s, then the official support for Docker as a Container Runtime should completely stop with the release of 1.23.

It should also mention that Docker was the technology that brought containerization to the masses. Whereas the containerization technology itself has been around for a long time, its users were often mostly ""geeks.”

There is to know:

* Differences between containerization and virtualization;
* Which Linux kernel components are necessary for containers to work;
* How to run docker containers using public docker images;
* Be able to write your own Dockerfiles based on best practices (layer order, caches, multi-stage builds, etc.);
* Prepare docker-compose files to speed up and simplify local development;
* how the network works in docker;
* Security practices for docker and dockerized applications;
* How to switch to dockerless tools if necessary. For example, buildkit, buildah, kaniko, etc.

## Terraform and IaC

Among the great variety of tools (pulumi, Cloudformation, AWS CDK, etc.) that help bring the **IaC** (Infrastructure as a Code) approach to the masses, we decided to use **Terraform** as a main tool to describe the infrastructure component. 

It's essential to know about:

1. Terraform is not a silver bullet and cannot replace absolutely all tools. To configure virtual machines, it is better to use the following tools:a) Packer;b) Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Salt;c) Whatever you want (bash?).
2. Terraform is not a multi-cloud management tool. It can be called so with a huge stretch. By managing only AWS, you cannot deploy the infrastructure in the GCP using the same code. Each provider has its own set of resources, and these resources are called differently. However, the use of Terraform allows us not to learn the new syntax of various tools and new approaches to organizing code for working with different clouds/providers. Which at times speeds up the process of writing, maintaining, and transferring code between engineers.

Knowledge requirements:

* Ability to read someone else's terraform code. It means that you can read and understand the code used in the public modules (input/output parameters, logic, resources used); 
* Fluent usage of public modules;
* Ability to describe the infrastructure of the project in the form of readable, maintainable and reusable code;
* Writing your own modules and understanding how to use them;
* Understanding how to organize the structure of the project;
* Manually work with a state file (importing existing resources into code, deleting objects, moving objects between resources (for example - from a resource to a module));

## CI/CD

It is now impossible to imagine any project that wants to reduce Time-To-Market without losing quality and doesn't use **CI / CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment)** processes. Therefore, it is vital to understand the concepts and apply them correctly. Our task is often to write a pipeline regarding the development and source code flow. Let's consolidate the idea that we don't pull the flow on the pipeline but adjust the pipeline to the flow. Now it is practically not important which CI / CD system will be used, because they all have pretty much the same functionality. BUT it is important to remember that EDGE cases exist, and knowing the strengths/weaknesses of a particular system will allow you to make the right choice at the right time.

Necessary knowledge in this field:

* Understanding of the CI, CD, and CD concepts. Know what it is, and what the differences are.
* Writing simple and readable pipelines;
* Ability to transfer the development flow to the CI / CD pipeline, which may include complex logic:- rollbacks,- manual steps,- trigger other jobs, services,- notifications.;
* Pipeline optimization. Ability to find bottlenecks, speed up, and optimize in terms of cost;
* Knowledge of various strategies for rolling out a new release and the ability to implement them:- Rolling update,- Blue/Green;- Canary;
* GitOps - what is it, when is it better to apply, and what tools are better to use;
* Knowledge of tooling. Integrate infrastructure and application code analysis, images and systems for vulnerabilities, and security checks of public endpoints into pipeline steps.

## AWS/Azure/GCP (Cloud)

Each of these cloud providers offers over 100 services. There will not be enough time to know everything in detail. A considerable part of the services is quite unique and may never be encountered in work.

What is necessary to know:

* How to set up a network: this may include services such as VPC, Security groups and ACLs, topology and subnets, peerings, VPN etc;
* Virtual machine;
* IAM;
* Storages: block and object storages;
* Container deployment services: ECS, AppRunner, Beanstalk, AppEngine, Web Apps, etc;
* Database services (both relational and not);
* Managed Kubernetes cluster services;
* Load Balancers, CDNs, WAFs.

When building a cloud infrastructure, it is also helpful:

* Understand and know the various PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS. This knowledge can significantly speed up the start of the project without unnecessary steps;
* Be able to migrate to clouds from on-premise and between clouds. It is necessary to calculate the capacity and cost correctly, choose the required services, develop and implement migration plan;
* Constantly keep the Cost optimization paradigm in mind and apply cost reduction practices (spots, reserved, preemptible nodes, better and more efficient services or self-hosted solutions);
* Understand a Well-architected framework and be able to build infrastructure around it;
* Know how to build an infrastructure that meets certain compliances (iso 27001, PCI, GDPR, HIPAA) and is ready for audits;
* Be able to effectively manage an extensive infrastructure (monthly check is over 10k and above).

## Kubernetes

Where it is possible (and this is 99.9999999% of projects), we are using Managed solutions from cloud providers, which marks the nature of working with k8s. Most of the time, we act as cluster users, not cluster administrators; that is why the list of necessary expertise is based on user experience:

* Can distinguish managed and vendors: GKE, EKS, AKS. Know what are the advantages and disadvantages.
* Understand, able to work and debug the main objects: Pod, Deployment, Replicaset, Jobs/Cron Jobs, DaemonSet, Statefulset.
* Need to know the types of services and what Ingress is.
* Be able to work with Configmaps, Secrets, sealed secrets, and external secrets.
* Understand the differences between the sidecar and init containers and their application
* Cluster autoscaling. Use different types of nodes and pools for cost-optimization.
* Apply advanced pod scheduling techniques: nodeSelector, affinity, antiAffinity, topologySpread.
* Pod/namespace resource management.
* Understand and configure RBAC and Network Policies.
* Know the differences between Admission and Mutating controllers. And be able to write solutions if necessary.
* Implement ServiceMesh where needed.
* Widespread application/implementation of Security practices. Use OPA (Open Policy Agent) if necessary.
* Basic understanding of the architecture: what are the components, what are they responsible for, and how are they interconnected.

## Helm

Since helm is a tool for Kubernetes, all requirements are connected to k8s knowledge, for example:

* “Reading” public helm charts. What variables can be used, where they are substituted, and what k8s manifests the chart consists of.
* Create your own charts. Where it’s necessary use loops, conditions, and functions to reduce the amount of code. Templates must be readable.
* Write Umbrella charts if needed.
* How to customize/patch public charts (i.e., adding new objects).
* Experience with tools like helm-diff and helmfile.

## Observability

One of the most critical components of modern systems is **Observability**. It is impossible to efficiently deliver changes to the user and efficiently manage resources without well-tuned observability tools.

We often hear only about “Monitoring” and “Logging.” Observability is a broader concept that includes monitoring, logging and tracing.

Expected skills:

* Having the ability to work with popular monitoring systems: Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, etc. and components around them (ie numerous exporters);
* Ability to work with widespread logging systems/stacks: ELK, EFK, Loki, Datadog, etc.;
* Experience with popular tracing systems: Jaeger, APM, etc.;
* Errors tracking and performance monitoring: Sentry, NewRelic, etc.;
* Knowledge of how to make custom dashboards for Grafana based on the requirements;
* Have skill to parse and filter logs in used logging systems.

## Security

It is tough to create a clear list of requirements because we are not security specialists but rather implementers. So here are the general points:

* Adhere to the Least Privileges principles when working with users, service accounts, and granting rights.
* Over the past few decades, the infrastructure building process has changed dramatically.  Earlier, the main and wrong idea was ""secure by default” inside your private network,” then all-new approaches are closer to “Zero Trust“ (we do not trust anyone or anything). Therefore, one should try to adhere to this concept wherever possible inside and outside your infrastructure.
* Know ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, CIS Benchmark, and OWASP standards.

## Solution Development

An important element of our work is the development and implementation of solutions. The goal of such solutions is to simplify development, reduce costs, switch to a new, more efficient, safer technology, etc. From here, it follows several necessary performing skills:

* Ability to decompose tasks into atomic subtasks;
* Ability to estimate your effort;
* Ability to specify requirements;
* Ability to build a Roadmap and move along it;
* Ability to find and apply “effective solutions” to emerging problems and challenges;
* Documentation management;
* Independent research, development and presentation of PoC;
* Implementing maintainable and customizable production-ready solutions.

## DevOps/SRE

Everyone knows that DevOps and SRE are primarily cultural aspects and practices. Where DevOps comes from development and is aimed at delivering a feature to the client, and SRE comes from operations and is aimed at stability. Our requirements are pretty basic:

* Have a good understanding of SDLC, primarily interested the Agile model;
* Know what Delivery Pipeline and Feedback Loop are. Be able to build/optimize these processes together with the team, to select an adequate tool for each step;
* Understand and be able to build an incident management process:- Logging and categorization,- Notification and escalation,- Finding and eliminating the root cause,- Playbook writing;
* Be able to write post mortems for systematically improve stability and quality;
* Be able to develop and implement a Disaster Recovery plan acceptable to the business requirements.

## Soft Skills

In addition to the fact that a good DevOps engineer should have a broad technical outlook and a number of automation skills, it is extremely important to develop soft skills. That is, those personal qualities that help to effectively connect and synchronize the work of all participants and departments into a single whole. There is no doubt that the existence of well-developed soft-skills is an important element in both personal growth and career progression (and sometimes a fundamental one).

Most often, engineers are private people, but times change, and it is impossible to work alone. The DevOps engineer is the link between operations, development, and managers. He constantly has to communicate with the team, helping to achieve a common goal.

What stands out among the skills:

* **Self-education.** Nowadays, when technologies are changing every day, it is impossible to rely on knowledge gained 10 years ago (if it is basic things, such as TPC / IP). It is necessary to constantly improve and learn something new. Without self-study, it is impossible to quickly improve your hard skills.
* **Сommunication skills.** The devops workflow is mostly based on teamwork, communications, problem escalation, etc. Also, within the framework of such communications, it is really possible to test and pump your hard skills. Furthermore, do not forget how you formulate your thoughts when setting goals and tasks. Your team should receive clear and understandable explanations of tasks.
* **Self-organization.** Ability to work independently without constant mentoring. We're not talking about when you have just started your duties and do not even know the direction in which you need to work. But the faster you can start working without a permanent mentor, then faster the leveling process will go.
* **Mentorship.** You don't have to be a Senior Engineer to mentor someone. The ability to teach others is a good way to consolidate and systematize your own existing knowledge. It also helps to develop communication skills.
* **Commitment.** You need to be able to achieve your goals alone or working in a team. It’s not always possible to get into a project with a team of DevOps engineers, so you need to be able to set and achieve your goals.
* **Fluency in English**. Most of the knowledge sources are written in English. Technologies are also created in English. Work in development and operation is carried out in English.

In our company, we made a special matrix specially for soft skills' assessment, where all the necessary skills are highlighted.

## Summary

To summarize, the meaning of DevOps-engineer in different companies is different, making it difficult to compile a single list of specialist competencies. Even with a 10-year career, so many directions and pitfalls are not enough time to study them. It is also worth considering what services companies are using - some use cloud services, while others use their own or rented hardware. Therefore, the required knowledge will depend on which company you want to work for. Especially for this case, we have compiled our DevOps engineer skills matrix to simplify the work process for applicants and employees.

personalfinance,How to go about buying a house?,"My husband (31M) and I (28F) have a net worth of 340k right now. I’m a resident physician and he’s a software engineer and our annual income before taxes is around 260k, not including his bonuses and stuff. We invest 50-70% of our income most months. Depending on my future career plans (fellowship or not, if fellowship, where I end up getting in), we may or may not buy a house in a year. It’s not finalised yet and things are very much up in the air. We don’t have an escrow account or anything and all our investments are down right now. If we were to buy a house, should we sell our stocks at a big loss, in order to put a 20% down payment, or should we put down a smaller amount, keep our stocks to avoid the loss, and pay the higher interest rate and PMI? If we decide to do the latter, is it possible to refinance, put a bigger amount towards down payment so that our interest rate and monthly payments, including PMI go down? With this bear market, we are itching to put as much money into the market as possible, but are also worried of tying this money up when we may need a down payment. Very confused about how do to go about it. We are immigrants and not very experienced with mortgages.",finance,1655406777
investing,Are rising interest rates actually helpful for the housing market?,"I apologize in advance as I'm pretty naive on the subject.

I've heard a lot of discussion from various people (I know, not legitimate sources) about how a ton of real estate is getting gobbled up above asking price in full cash.

If this is the case, wouldn't the issue of unaffordable housing for the lower and middle class be exacerbated? When you can pay in full up front, you don't care what the interest rates are because you won't have anything to pay off.

That and given the struggles in the rest of the investing world, wouldn't this create a safe haven of an investment as long as this demand exists?

Furthermore, wouldn't this fuel existing homeowners who lack the cash to buy other real estate to not sell?

Then again, maybe there aren't that many people scooping up real estate in cash. But if there are, wouldn't this cause housing prices to not drop or correct? And if so, just how much damage will this do to the lower and middle class attempting to purchase a home?",finance,1655406782

stocks,"Stocks Plunge Thursday Afternoon as Recession Fears Mount; Financial Services Lead Lows, Homebuilders Fall on Rising Mortgage Rates","During trading Thursday, 1 stock traded to a 52-week high, while 205 stocks bottomed out at new 52-week lows. The S&amp;P 500 is down 3.39% so far today while the Dow is down 2.45%, the Nasdaq is down 4.27%, and the Russell 2000 is down 4.7%.

Stocks are sharply lower Thursday afternoon. Cryptos are lower. Recession fears are weighing on sentiment following yesterday's 75 basis point rate hike as traders worry that the Fed may have to put the economy in a recession in order to tame inflation.

KB Home (KBH) is declining 8.81% as homebuilders fall on rising rates. Mortgage rates saw their largest jump since 1987, hitting 5.78% - which is the highest rate since 2008. Meanwhile, Housing Starts came in at an annualized rate of 1.549 million homes, missing estimates for 1.7 million and down from 1.8 million in April. Meanwhile, Building Permits slowed more than expected to a pace of 1.695 million following April's annualized rate of 1.823 million.

Lastly, Kroger Co (KR) is down 0.94% after the company reported a solid beat-and-raise. Kroger handily beat earnings and revenue estimates, while providing upside full-year 2023 guidance. Profit-taking was likely behind today's selling, which saw the stock down over 2% at one point, despite the solid report.

economy,Housing Crash is Imminent - Change My Mind,"With the rate increase to 6% by the Fed, I believe the housing market is screwed. 

Let’s say we have a house, and let’s say it’s the average median house, and let’s call it House 1. House 1 was bought in 2021 at $300k. A $300k house at 2% was around $400k after 30 years (fixed rate mortgage). At the new rates (6%), that same house would need to be $185k  for the 30 year total price to be $400k. That means selling pressure is going to collapse for sellers, which means the only people selling are going to sell only if they have to - which means they’re willing to take losses on their home values. Demand is also going to drop a crazy if not equivalent amount.

Assuming people are still willing to pay at the most $400k in total price after 30 years for Home 1, the price of that home will need to drop at least 30-40% to be within reach of our buyer’s 30 year price limit. If we assume this true of every house in the market, since every mortgage has bumped up to at least 6%, the “i have to sell” sellers will dictate the market, and prices will tank everywhere by 30-40%. Buyers from the last 3-4 years will be paying a $1.5M mortgage on $900k house.

And that’s assuming fixed rate mortgages. Only God can save variable rate mortgage buyers. 

Is there anything wrong with my analysis or am I missing anything? It seems pretty obvious based on this that the crash is imminent, but I guess that’s good for renters and prospective first time home buyers.",finance,1655408814
vet,What is wrong with my dog please help,"My dog has been acting terribly these past few days, she's lost her balance, can barely walk, can't pee without slipping, ignores food and water.

Full story with ALL the symptoms ahead, symptoms evolution in bold:

I have to begin with some background as I think it's important. She is a Chihuahua, about 7 years old. *She was abused and neglected* in her previous household for idk how long, so she's always been very scaredy and skittish, taking her time to get used to us. She was in heat last May. She was specially attached to my mom, she went away on a trip on June 2nd and i decided to take the dog to spend a couple days with my boyfriend on some apartment.

She was ok, not very scared of my boyfriend who she doesn't know, but started to *not eat and drink as much.*
We came back home and a day later my mom came back to, but 1 day later she left for some days to be in my brothers place. I stayed with our two dogs, but the little one *wouldn't come out of my bed all day, not drink, not eat* until I kinda forced her to and only peed when i placed her off my bed. I thought she missed my mom cause she was behaving like a very depressed person, so I took her with my mom, and next day I left to my boyfriend's place for the weekend

We had to take her to the vet on Sunday, we waited for hours and at one point, *she suffered some sort of episode* for the first time. I went to use the bathroom after we let her walk around a little, and when i came back my mom was holding her, when i grabbed the dog *she was super stiff, raising her front legs in a weird way almost touching her face,* i placed her on the floor without letting her go and *she started flapping her front legs uncontrollably* so I kept holding her until she calmed down. 

They ran a blood test that night and determined *she was dehydrated and famished* and suggested to let her spend the night there, the next day they performed an ultrasound (? on her and determined she had *an uterus infection and needed surgery,* the vet left me alone with the dog in the room with some wet food and water in case she'd want to eat while I was around. She walked around the room a bit, looking weak and scared, ate some food and *suffered another episode like the day before, this time shaking and losing balance, unable to walk.* I spent the day calling other vets to check the prices and decided to take her to the vet we always go to. 

We went to the previous vet and before letting us go with her, the vet showed us a video she took moments earlier before she picked her up, *suffering another episode as described before*, and said she had to give her some valium. When we got home she behaved fairly normally, just s bit weak, later *she wouldn't move much from the bed* and we though maybe it's the valium. That evening we went to the other vet, they took another ultrasound and said she had *no uterus infection, plus one of the parameters from the blood test did not match with that diagnosis from most other dogs*. He believes she has a *fake pregnancy*, she does have *liquid in her breast* and prescribed us with a medicine to treat it, he also believe *the seizure-like episodes might have been triggered by the stress and lack of nourishment.* 

*Currently we are waiting for the treatment to help her improve, but as of now she only seems to have gotten worse. When she stands she is shaking as if trying to maintain her balance, she lacks control of her 4 legs and when she takes a piss, not only can't she keep her balance but her pee keeps coming out after she's seemingly done which makes me believe she doesn't have much control on her bladder either. She is absolutely lethargic, on her bed, she is force fed through a syringe with water too. This all seems like a neurological problem* to me and I'm worried sick, i don't know how this happened or why it's happening, please any suggestions is much appreciated and thank you for taking your time to read, i really don't want to lose her like this.",cryptocurrency,1655409203

personalfinance,Is there a way to use equity in my current home to buy a second house that needs major work?,"Sorry if this is dumb- I have no idea if this is possible and if so, how do I do it?

TLDR- I have about 250k of equity in my current home. I probably wouldn’t qualify for a second mortgage with my income alone, and current interest rates suck anyway. Is there a way to use my equity to purchase a second property?

Details:

Current home purchased in 2011 for 185k, current value probably around 375-400k, mortgage balance is 112k at 2.375%

Current income is about $57k. Only other debt is about $5k in student loans. I do have a major amount (900k) that I inherited that’s in various investments right now. 

The house next door to mine has been basically empty/abandoned for over a year. It’s seriously run down. It’s not for sale but I looked up the owner through county records and I plan to write them and see if they’re interested in selling. I want to fix it up for my elderly mother to move in when she gets to the point of needing more help. If/when that happens, she would be able to sell her current house and pay off the fixer house. 

I know that my income alone wouldn’t qualify me for a second mortgage (I also know nothing about how mortgages work for fixer-uppers). Is there a way to use the equity in my current house to buy the second property? Would it be reasonable to pull from my inheritance/investments for this purpose? What are the tax or other implications of either of those paths?",finance,1655409638

I drive a 2002 Toyota rav 4 with roughly about 150,000 miles on it at this moment.

Was given the idea of applying for a personal loan with my bank and putting some of my own cash about 3 grand per say plus the loan to buy a car out right in cash.

And given that I live with my parents right now I have no other costs to worry about for now.
The idea is to whether use my own bank as the primary place to get the loan or go to a navy federal credit union to apply for a car loan or even a personal loan there.
 
On a side note, when purchasing a car outright from these smaller dealers with pre owned cars, is it possible to bring my own mechanic and take a look into the car to see if what I am purchasing is in good condition.

She has lived basically in poverty her whole life. Her mom doesn’t drive so the car was their only mode of transportation. Not enough money set aside to buy a reliable car for cash either especially with how the values of cars have been.

She got a new car as prices were better in general for new vs used plus she wanted a warranty. 

Here is the awful awful part. She had low credit score, her mom co-signed with her low credit score and they had no down payment. Her current car payment is $730/month. I wanted to puke when she told me. I believe her interest rate is somewhere in the 20%+ realm financed through Santander.

Here is my question: 

She bought the car in December 2021. When is the earliest she should look at refinancing the car? Assuming she made all the payments on time, would her credit score be improved enough by now? Just trying to help her out here.

Despite these heavy hikes, they've had essentially no effect on employment, which goes against the recent narrative that we're heading into a recession, or at least a recession similar in effect to those we've felt in the past. Sure, we may end up with a technical recession, due to the heavy importing from last quarter. Continuing Jobless Claims was also similar, and Manufacturing prices have fallen to levels they were pre Russia Ukraine. Building is down quite a lot, and I believe that's what caused the fall we seen, but realistically this should've been expected with increasing interest rates, and I don't see it holding with such high demand for housing. Where I live, it's almost impossible to find a place to even rent, which implies that there lies a rent market that has yet to been taken advantage of.

personalfinance,Student Loans into IRA,"Okay hear me out before you say immediately no. 

I am a medical student and since 2019 the interest rate on student loans have been paused at 0%. As a result I have been taking out the maximum allowed loan amount per year, in total going into my final year of school I have an extra $30k of loan money I do not need. In total if I take the max amount out I will have \~250k total in loans. 

The way I see it is that I can either take that extra, pay it all back and end up with 220k total or I can start putting the extra 30k into an IRA, doing the max for the next 4 years until I have a dr. salary. 

My loans are all federal with an average interest rate of about 7%, I plan to keep up with the interest in residency (58k salary) and doing income based repayment so I am not totally poor. So if my loan balance is 250k my monthly amount to pay off the interest (compounds daily rip) is $880.61 vs. $878.21 if I pay back the extra. 

If I start putting this in a Roth IRA now (which I couldn't do once I have a dr. salary) at age 26 by the time I retire by age 65 the account would mathematically be worth around $275k (used an online IRA calc saying I start with 24k in the account at age 30 making $0 in further contributions). 

Total by keeping the money out I would be paying an extra 30k + $500 in added interest over the life of the loan. 

This seems like that math is 100% in my favor to do this is there something I am missing because it feels too good to be true??

Not sure if I should flair this debt or retirement.

Editing to say I hold out to contribute it once I start residency, I.E. have an income so I can contribute to the IRA.
Also I realize it seems risky but the idea is that I’ll have to pay the interest on my loan anyway and while in residency it’s really not possible to pay down the principal by a significant amount (after taxes and interest I bring home like $600 per week)",finance,1655416967

CryptoCurrency,"After 18 months of holding on coinbase, i jumped ship to a cold wallet - here's my thoughts to those thinking of doing the same","So tonight was the arrival of my ledger nano s plus. Super chuffed. I've been happily holding on Coinbase and selling/buying through Coinbase Pro for the last year and a half and all has been easy, felt safe. I held some coins like Algo on a hot wallet for staking, so was familiar with the concept and importance of the passphrase/private key.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, considering the uncertain confidence in CEX's atm, I decided to finally heed the voices of so many and take the plunge going offline. Here's some points I learned about things that some others might not know (and get that moment of panic):

&amp;#x200B;

* **Your receiving Bitcoin address will change after every transaction**  
Despite having Bitcoin for months, I've never got exposed to the public address until now.
* **If you bought Matic on Coinbase, it'll appear in your Ethereum portfolio**  
It's an ERC20 token on Coinbase rather than a native Matic network coin, don't panic if your Polygon portfolio is empty on LedgerLive, look in Ethereum
* **If you watch the current Gas Fee on coinmarketcap or similar, you'll save a chunk of change**  
I was expecting the worst when it came to sending on the Ethereum network. When the gas was 35gwei on coinmarketcap, I paid no more than a fiver for my transactions
* **Bitcoin transactions are way cheaper than I thought**  
The charges for transactions was really small compared to Ethereum, a nice surprise
* **You'll need an OTG cable to set up on mobile**  
At least for this Nano S Plus, a cable with USB-C on both ends is needed. Nano X has bluetooth
* **It's very uneasy seeing your Coinbase portfolio completely cliff-face**  
On the other hand, it's REALLY sweet seeing your portfolio grow back on LedgerLive. Especially knowing it can never be taken away from you by a CEX closure/hack.

I know much of this is probably common sense to most people who are in the crypto space. For those like myself who basically bounced between coinbases' exclusively, got sheltered by network fee's and the like.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not so bad out here in the wild. Cosier than I thought. And there are still pretty portfolio graphs to look at.

We were supposed to close on the sale by early July, but now our mortgage payment is going to be $400 more 💀 Are we fucked?

bonds,A little confused about Bloomberg News chart,So on Bloomberg News yesterday after the 75bp interest rate hike I saw showed some of the US Treasury bonds “US Yields” and they all were in green writing between 0.03 and 0.05. They all had green arrows pointing down next to the numbers too. I was a little confused because if it were the price of the bond going down it would make sense that it’s green arrows pointing down but Yield is the name of the chart so a lower yield is bad.

personalfinance,Filing Chapter 7 with mental health issues that affect spending habits,"Hello. I’m hoping I can get some helpful insight and advice about my situation. I have dealt with PTSD and anxiety disorder for most of my life. My parents were alcoholics and drug addicts, but I never manifested those issues; I developed issues with compulsive behavior to avoid trauma and stress. A big part of that has been a lifetime of compulsive/impulsive spending habits. I recently started therapy to tackle this because the stress has been incredible and adversely affecting my health. Due to my debt burden, and lack of income or assets, I was advised to consider Ch.7 bankruptcy. 

Somehow, I managed to make it into my mid-30s without crippling myself financially, but I had a very difficult time in 2016-2018 and overspent, then was unemployed from 2018 until the present.

I tried to keep up with debt payments, but interest rates and lack of income overwhelmed me. The stress and anxiety caused me to avoid the issue because I felt it was insurmountable. Accounts went delinquent, went into collections, and now, a couple of years later, I’m starting to see lawsuits being filed against me. Somehow, they’ve only been filed in old jurisdictions and I’ve never been served, so cases have been dismissed for lack of prosecution or dismissed by the plaintiff. My luck will run out eventually, though.

I consulted with an attorney regarding chapter 7, and they requested six months of bank statements. Here is where the heart of my concern lies. I’m grateful to have a family member who cares about me and has the means to support me so I don’t end up homeless. They’ve been sending me money to pay my bills, but like a heroin addict, I’ve taken advantage of that to feed my addiction. I would come up with excuses for why I needed more money and would use that to make stupid purchases on pet supplies, etc. but nothing one would consider a “luxury” (no jewelry, trips, or big screen televisions).

It wasn’t until I sought help and really confronted the issue that I realized how crazy my problem was. My monthly expenses are very high due to insane rent and cost of living, but there are thousands of dollars per month of impulse purchases. I am working on fixing this behavior and making amends, but regardless, my statements show transfers in and purchases out of thousands over my basic living expenses. 

When a trustee sees this, I’m worried they’ll get the wrong idea even if I’m 100% honest about my mental health issues, and that it will negatively affect my filing. I have not incurred any further debt; this is all liquid-cash in cash out from money gifted to me.

Should I reconsider filing until I have six months of statements in recovery from my compulsive spending habits, or can I explain my situation and the steps I’m taking to improve my mental health and financial stability?

Thank you.",finance,1655420962

25k emergency fund in a HYSA

37k cash/checking (dry powder, 10k earmarked for I-bonds when they verify my account)

~50k brokerage/ index ETFs

~55k various retirement/ IRA accounts


I pay 700/mo on rent and about 1000-1500/mo on everything else. I’m in a pretty good place. 

Here’s my dilemma: I don’t currently own a car, I don’t NEED one (I WFH), but my gf and I currently rely on friends to drive us to go hiking, skiing (our main weekend pastimes) and get out of the city. We usually pay for gas in return. I also spend about 1-2k/ year on rental cars for longer trips. 

In short, I want a car (Subaru outback, forester, Mazda cx50, 30-35k) to have more autonomy and not be limited to our friends’ schedules but the idea of blowing so much money on something that is a want and not a need seems kind of absurd to me. In the current market I can’t rationalize buying used, but the price of a new car scares me. 

I feel like I’m not doing the things I love as much as I’d like to, and am living a less than ideal lifestyle, but also feel like it’s an extreme expense and hassle to buy a car. I don’t want to work into my 60s. I’ve been deferring this decision for 2-3 years now and getting fed up with thinking about it!

personalfinance,Advice on lost federal check?,"I received a treasury check in the mail the first week of May.   I assumed it was my federal return and filed to the inbox of my kitchen table.  Strange that it arrived in the mail...I'd filed taxes requesting automatic deposit....but anyway.  Next day I get ready to go to the bank and....it's nowhere to be found 

I turned the house upside down.  It's gone.

I contacted the IRS.  They explained that my refund was, in fact, directly deposited. I confirmed this with the bank.    Did they send any other payments by mail?   No.

I contacted social security.  They've sent nothing this year.  VA?  Same thing.

I had opened the envelope at least enough to confirm that it was a US Treasury check for 500 and some odd dollars.  That was all that I mentally gave to it before filing it on the kitchen table.

I'm in a bit of a panic here.  Have I simply lost 500 dollars?  I've checked with friends, personal bank officers, many many hours with the IRS on phone/hold....everything short of hiring an tax professional,  who likely can't do any more than I've already done to track this down.

Is there ANY way of discovering what federal agency, from among perhaps a dozen, that might have cut me a check in early May of 2022?  A contact of some sort at the US Treasury itself?

CryptoCurrency,Important discussion on ETH,"* **ETH market cap: $130B**
* **Tether market cap: $80B**

Ethereans know me as the guy who’s been warning about Celsius, liquid staking derivatives, regulation, and the Merge for months. I explained being short ETH to $800, and my paper profit is already big enough I’m considering closing the position out--but won't. I also predicted that USDC would flip ETH in the next 12 months based on its incredible growth and the fact ETH is a gas token that ferries around centralized derivative money like stablecoins and wrapped bitcoin collateral. But ETH’s decline into obsolescence has been so swift, that it looks like Tether will achieve this feat first. Tether’s market cap has changed only marginally with this broad selloff, and as more money (especially foreign money) flees crypto, its market cap will probably increase marginally.

If USDT stays near $80B, then a decline of ETH to $680 per token will see it flipped. With a decline below $500, USDC will have a chance to flip it as well. In a previous post I described the #3 spot on the market cap rankings as the Game of Thrones spot. Nothing that ever sits there survives. In the last 24 months we’ve had these pretenders to the throne:

* LTC
* ADA
* XRP
* DOGE
* USDT
* BNB

ETH will be next. What’s coming out of the disaster its dapps, DeFi, web3, and collateralizations have created is liability. It’s being dumped as an institutional asset. There are class actions on behalf of Beacon Chain holders being prepared against the devs for delays, with some rumors they colluded with CeFi and LSD’s. Then there are securities regulations that will arrive maybe as soon as this month with the Celsius and 3AC implosions.

Perhaps the worst statistic though is one many have’t noticed but I’ve had my eye on. It’s this: If you look back all the way to 2019 at the top ERC-20 tokens (not stablecoins), then what you notice is that all of them were climbing the market cap ranking ladder slowly. So much so, that it appeared ERC-20 tokens would by 2023 hold a staggering 5 of the top 10 spots. It was telling of how dominant the Ethereum Network was becoming compared its crypto competition, nothing else was competing. That’s over though. In the last 12 months they’ve gotten obliterated, from oracles and sidechains to beloved DeFi dapps. What remains of the ERC world is centralized derivative money—stablecoins and WBTC. Go have a looksie. The top 3 ERC tokens by market cap behind ETH are:

* USDC
* WBTC
* DAI

And ETH itself is about to be flipped by its own native stablecoin (USDC) within 12 months after losing the #2 spot to Tether this summer. The CME trader Copper Beckville has a $96 short cover target on ETH over the next 24 months. I’m inclined to trust that. He called this back in May and does a spectacular job breaking down why Ethereum is an IOU database:

[https://twitter.com/tenderscore/status/1530790900749676544?s=20&amp;t=9YLTU3utKggc6M0LrP8xbQ](https://twitter.com/tenderscore/status/1530790900749676544?s=20&amp;t=9YLTU3utKggc6M0LrP8xbQ)

So it appears the prestige of Ethereum is dying, that the PoS Merge has been a nightmare and may not happen, that the token supply manipulating EIP-1559 has done nothing, and that its VC-backed DeFi vaporware has driven the nail into the crypto space at large. Not even CEX’s which played a boiler room and DAO inside trading role will survive without consolidation and restructuring, because if you read Coinbase’s 10-k’s, then you’ll know they’re not a profitable business without a robust sh\*tcoin market. Bitcoin is no longer profitable for them. They can’t control it. This partly why they tried forking it back during SegWit2x, unsuccessfully colluding with devs and miners and embarrassing themselves after getting caught and easily defeated.

I'd also like to add that there's an inflation danger brewing with ETH as well. Its average net issuance reduction averages 55% since EIP-1559 went into effect. But for the last month it's averaging 33% and slowing. It's currently 25% or so. ETH is highly reactive to DeFi volume and liquidity. If that dries up (it's gotten gutted recently) because of regulations, there's some serious trouble there until a potential merge cools the inflation a bit, but it's not guaranteed. This is why I'm such a huge fan of bitcoin's fixed monetary policy and against token manipulation and other non-sense like EIP-1559, which is Federal Reserve 2.0 type stuff.

So if you want to stick around this dying protocol as liquidity is drained from its dapps permanently before regulations, I’ll list the top 4 tokens in its entire ecosystem by both market cap and volume, and I want you to ask why something like this would have a future:

1. USDC (centralized derivative of USD)
2. WBTC (centralized derivative of BTC)
3. DAI (centralized derivative of USD)
4. SHIB (dog meme of the dog meme coin DOGE)

Derivative bull\*\*\*t. ETH⤵🗑

Even *“world computer*” is scammy VC bull\*\*\*t. That’s just another derivative of something we already have—the internet—except less efficient, more expensive, harder to use, and much slower.

To give a quick picture of a finances we are homeowners with about 110k in equity in our home and we have 2 car loans. I have a new 2022 car with a loan of 26k… the estimated current value of my car is around 45k. Our predicament is we have around 9k in CC debt combined. We originally planned to pay this off but had unexpected things come up. The CC debt really stresses me out, I never thought I would be one to have a lingering amount on my CC. Our financial advisor told us one quick way to payoff the debt would to be to refinance my car and use the equity to pay off the credit cards.

personalfinance,Mortgage rate lock-in help!,"Hi,

So my wife and I are in the process of buying a house. Originally we were working with a lender who approved us without a lock. We really like this lender, and they’ve been helpful ever since. However, they wouldn’t lock in a rate, and with the market like it is, I figured we should shop around.

A few days ago, I re-applied for a mortgage with another company, who is allowing rate locks, figuring and probably not thinking, that we can use one or the other depending on when we find a house (within the next 60 days). We were overly concerned with the market and rates jumping up so quickly with fed bps hikes.

We just found a house this evening that we love, and are intending on putting an offer down. However, I’ve signed the rate lock documents with the new lender, but I’d rather give my business to/work with my original lender, who we do not have a lock with. 

Perhaps I overreacted when I signed the documents, but my wife hasn’t signed all of the loan documents yet (she will be on the mortgage with me), so I’m not sure the rate lock is effective until that happens.


Am I on the hook for any fees if I go with my original lender over the one I have a rate lock with? I couldn’t find a good answer anywhere, and the rate lock document doesn’t specify a fee if I do not close with the lender.

We are first time homebuyers who are a bit overwhelmed by this process.

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Payments Possible if They Don’t Penetrate Russia’s Financial System, Central Bank Says","Bank of Russia Chair Ready to Accept Cryptocurrency Payments for International Settlements

Cryptocurrencies can be employed in international payments if they do not “penetrate” the financial system of the Russian Federation, according to Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). The official added that these digital assets are subject to high price fluctuations and emphasized:


''Cryptocurrency should not be traded on organized marketplaces because this asset is too volatile, too risky for potential investors.''

Quoted by RBC Crypto, the banker said that digital coins listed on Russian exchanges must be compliant with all regulations designed to protect investors. Hence, the projects behind the traded assets should have a prospectus, a responsible person, and meet information disclosure requirements.

Nabiullina’s statement comes after last month when her deputy, Ksenia Yudaeva, announced that the CBR is not against the use of decentralized digital assets in “international transactions and the international financial infrastructure,” signaling a softening of the regulator’s stance on crypto payments amid expanding financial sanctions on Russia.

 Central banks no longer agree on interest rates. The US is raising aggressively, while the UK is taking a more cautious approach and Japan is sticking to its plan of “yield curve control”. John Stepek explains why this matters, and what it means for the markets and your money. Earlier this week, **the Federal Reserve raised interest rates** by three quarters of a percentage point. (That’s 75 basis points, or bps, in the financial jargon – so now you know what that particular acronym means). That wasn’t a surprise for markets, but only because the surprise had been sprung a couple of days earlier, when inflation hit a new 40-year high and markets were primed – via well-connected journos – to expect a big rise rather than just half a point. The Bank of England needs better communication skills, Yesterday, the Bank of England declined to copy its larger peer.  It raised interest rates by a quarter point. Six of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to raise rates by the quarter point, while three wanted to go further with the half point. So the Bank of England rate is now 1.25%.",finance,1655465562

 The Federal Reserve is trying to slow the economy, and the housing sector is bearing the full force of these actions right now. Costs are rising for buyers. Confidence from builders is falling. List prices are getting cut. And if the idea that the housing cycle is the business cycle holds any sway, the road ahead does not look pretty. The Census Bureau published its latest report on housing starts and building permits, which offers a monthly look at home construction activity nationwide, on Thursday morning. It showed that in May, the pace of new home construction fell by 14% from April to its lowest level in a year. In the mortgage market, things are even more challenging. Data out Thursday from Freddie Mac showed the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 5.78% last week, the highest since November 2008 and marking the largest one-week increase since 1987.",finance,1655466009

personalfinance,Best ways of financing some home improvements?,"We are looking at doing some home improvements and repairs over the next several months that will cost in the 30-50k range.

We currently have 13.5k left on our mortgage. Just outside of Austin, so housing market is insane and there is plenty of equity in the house though we have no plans to sell or move.

It seems like we have the following options to finance it:  


* Cash out refinance - rates would be around 5%, gives us 10 or 15 years to pay, but incurs roughly 5k in fees (exclusive of the interest). Also, short of accelerated payments (which should be possible), we are back to owing on our house for 10 or 15 more years
* Home Equity Loan/Home Equity Line of credit - it seems like the fees would be roughly equivalent to the cash out refi, slightly worse interest rate, but more flexibility in only taking out as much as we need when we need it (subject to the minimum disbursement) and not paying interest on unneeded portions of the loan (still a bit of uncertainty on how much we need).
* Personal Loan - it seems like a personal loan through a credit union would have much lower fees than refi/hel/heloc but slightly higher interest rates and a much shorter repayment time (3 or 6 years for the ones I looked at) so a higher monthly repayment (affordable). Like the Refi I would need to potentially request a bigger loan than needed, and pay extra interest up front until I know the money is not needed and can repay with excess funds. Also, unlike the refi/hel/heloc, probably is not tax deductible. 

Are there other options I am not considering? Are their pluses/minuses to each of the above that I am missing.",finance,1655469751

Cryptocurrencies continued declining on Friday, two days after the Federal Reserve stepped up the pace of interest-rate increases.

Bitcoin, the largest digital coin, fell more than 1% to $20,933, a loss of 30% in the past seven days. Ethereum was down 3%. Avalanche and Solana were both down about 1%.

Earlier in the week, crypto lender Celsius Network abruptly halted withdrawals, shaking confidence in the ecosystem of digital assets. On Thursday, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital failed to meet margin calls and had its positions liquidated. Cyrpto yield firm Finbox also capped withdrawals for users.

The combination of falling crypto prices and stress on the companies built around the assets are the latest signs that the industry is cracking. After trading similarly to risky stocks for months, cryptocurrencies have started to decline more steeply than other assets..

I was thinking of refinancing my personal loan at the same time I get my auto loan as well and paying it down faster. What should I do? I need a car badly. It’ll be my first car. Will lenders see I have taken a large loan out before and never missed payments and think I’m a more reliable person or see that it’s taking away from my disposable income and be more harsh with the rates offered on my auto loan? Should I go to a credit union? Will I be okay going to get the auto loan? I only pay 400 a month for rent and have virtually no expenses past those two things.

personalfinance,401k loan in todays market,"Hello, I am purchasing a new home in a month or so.  It was a new construction and I locked in at 3.875.

I have more than enough for a 25% down-payment, and to cover the major moving expenses.  But (other than my savings) I don't have a buffer on those move in funds.

However, I also have access to a 401k loan... I was considering pulling out \~35k, to give me some more liquidity and cover unexpected move in surprises and ease the transition.  If I do it now, I can get a 20y term on the 401k loan if I apply it to DP.  

My intent with these funds would be to have access to them to reduce usage of my credit card.  The 20y term will give me low monthly payments  I expect a healthy tax return and bonus next year, and will have (at todays value) \~120k of stock granted to me next year in Feb.  My intent would be to pay off the 401k loan in full at that time.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question- with the volatility in todays market, does it make sense to take a 401k loan out?  With interest rates rising, the stock market falling.... does it make it a more attractive time for a 401k loan?",finance,1655475804

A little back story I just received an offer letter for a new company for 80k USD. I live in Atlanta I am 27 turning 28 and I was making 56k this is a 25k bump roughly. I work in cyber security. 

I am thinking of buying a house currently I live with my GF and we split the rent(1680 a month)

Now that I am making more money would be wise to get the house now or wait down the line so I can make more money in future.

I have over 81k of student loan debt.
60k my federal student loans(I have not started to pay it yet)
20 in my state student loans( I pay 142 a month for this)

I have a car I owe 15k on.

Car note is 400 a month and insurance is 300 a month.

Also, have my credit card bills.
I keep them low my total credit limit is 34,300 I usually keep each under 6 percent usage.

My credit score is currently a 745.

With all of this should I get the house ?

Once student loans resume, I am sure they will want them 400-700 a  month.

Does it make sense to get a house? Will I even be able to afford it with all m student loan payments?",finance,1655481181

personalfinance,Housing Market - How to Make the Most of it?,"I find myself in a difficult situation and I don't know what is the best option to secure my financial future.

I currently own a house that I use as passive rental income ($200 per month profit), and being military, I currently live on base because our housing allowance isn't very good at my current duty station.

The rental house is currently up about $200k, and if I sold now I would pocket about $130k.  On the other hand, I could also justify raising the rent by about $400 per month ($600 per month profit) and continue to collect a solid amount of passive income.

But now the wrench in the situation...  I'm transitioning out soon and moving to Vegas for a new job.  This will be the place I retire and settle down for good.  I want to buy my ""forever home"" if you get my meaning.  This will be the house I want to grow old in and raise my family. 

I would like to buy a second home, so that way I can continue to build wealth in the first property, while simultaneously building wealth in my Vegas home.

But with interest rates so high, and so much uncertainty in the housing market, I'm worried about buying.  What can I do to best set up for success in the future and protect my financial well being?

The other issue is that I would need to come up with a 5% down payment minimum on a $500k house ($25k down).  Currently my checking is paycheck to paycheck with no real savings.  I could hypothetically pull 28k from my retirement account, though I understand that is generally frowned upon.  I could also dip into the equity on my first house by refinancing, but interest rates are currently garbage and I don't want to lose my current 3.8% on it.

My contention is that this time is truly different.  Hear me out.

During 2001-2003, while the overall equity markets were down each of the three years, there was still money to be made in commodities, fixed income, and precious metals.

In 2008, which is the worst market of all our lifetimes, one could make money in alternatives, fixed income (especially taxable income), and healthcare.

Even in 1973-74, there was money to be made in T-Bills, T-Bonds, and real estate.

This year has been different. There is money to be made in commodities especially with energy.  The only other sector that has been profitable is agriculture.  What seems to make this different, is that the more traditional hedges against down markets such as fixed income and precious metals have been losers too. The last time we had a market that was down over -20% and the treasury bond index was negative was in 1931. It appears we are in new territory for many of us, including professionals. This is function of rising interest rates from historical lows and an uncertain future for the global economy.  Based on inflationary numbers, every country on this planet is feeling it.

Pig organs are about the same size as human organs. So they can take a heart from a pig and decellularize it by washing all the cells out with some kind of detergent. What's left is just the collagen scaffolding which they then seed with millions of human stem cells, they take these stem cells from the human patient so there's no rejection issue.

With millions of boats on the water throughout the world, it's difficult for regulators to apprehend fishers who exceed quotas. Because of manual reporting processes, even individuals with no nefarious intent can unintentionally catch too much. OnDeck Fisheries AI is creating software to autonomously scan the number of fish loaded onto a ship. Without the need of human observers, the company's machine learning and computer vision technology tracks the precise biomass and species of fish. The goal is for regulators and fishermen to be able to rely on an automated system to ensure that they are following fishing restrictions. Fishermen, regulators, and research organizations from Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania are among its customers.

CryptoCurrency,"Stop looking at the 2021 values. Look at 2018, instead.","I was introduced to cryptocurrency way back in 2015, and I started following crypto news, coins, and charts in August 2017, still before the previous bullrun. At that time, I did not have much disposable income to buy coins, but I remember seeing how it seemed like the end of the world, as it was the first crypto bullrun to be given coverage and attention in all sorts of social media and press.

If you entered the crypto markets around 2020 and 2021, and you are panicking right now, then don’t. So far, we have had roughly a 4 year crypto cycle after each Bitcoin halvening, the last one happening in May 2020. It is absolutely foolish to look YTD (year to date) charts. Instead, one should be looking at values of the previous bullrun that ended in 2018. At that time, Bitcoin hit a low 3.3k USD and Ethereum of only 85 USD. 

I do not believe crypto going down, is a direct consequence of the stock-market, the war in Ukraine, or other major economic, social, and politic turnoil it is happening in the world. You might disregard my opinion, because I am a random anonymous dude on the internet, and the is fine. However, in my opinion, this crash was predictable just because let’s remind ourselves how many times crypto has already crashed, and yet always recovered stronger than before? 

Since last September, I have been warning my friends in crypto to start cashing out because my RSI indexes were way too strong and the one year MACD was flattening and showing signs of going back down. This ONLY meant there was a bigger probability of going down than going up - and beware I specifically mention “probability” because no one can be certain when X or Y happens, and if it will actually happen. But we still can calculate its likelihood of happening based on previous data. 

The biggest different to the previous bullruns is the current political, economic, and social conjuncture which is totally different. Besides housing crisis, interest rates, and war in Europe, we are having a massive inflation; which in practise means that BTC at 30k USD today, is essentially worth less than BTC a year ago at 30k USD; simply because if seen on a chart, inflation is fiat money also collapsing without having a trading pair to compare - the best case scenario that trading pair is the cost of living.

Right now, relax, enjoy the ride down, and soon enough we will start going sidewats again. Then, the time to buy and accumulate will start again. For those who entered the crypto market in 2020 or 2021, do not expect to see your money back that soon, especially if you have money in stuff other than BTC and ETH - for instance, there are some altcoins that during this bullrun did not pass their 2017-18 ATH (looking at you IOTA) - and many other coins and exchanges will eventually die in the upcoming months. But for the upcoming 2 years until the next halvening new stuff will appear, and finding those shooting gems, should be the thing you should be doing; so in case it shoots up to the starts you are ready to sell, instead of buying those expensive bags.",cryptocurrency,1655485599

stocks,Larry Summers' Q&amp;A is Gold -- A Must Read,"Barron's did a Q&amp;A with Larry Summers, the economist, former Treasury Secretary and former Harvard President.  It's a must-read if you're interested in our current economic situation.  He has been calling our inflation problem since the beginning.

A few highlights:

* *My judgment isn’t about the competence of the Fed. It’s a judgment about the difficulty of the task. The discouraging fact is that, when you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years.*
* *Monetary policy famously has worked with a lag of nine to 18 months. One of the reasons I worry about the Fed’s prospects for generating the soft landing we all want is that I like to compare* [*the Fed’s problem*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-rate-hike-inflation-swiss-london-51655385218?mod=article_inline) *to the challenge of adjusting the shower in an old hotel, where there’s a lag of 20 or 30 seconds between the time you turn the faucet and the time the water temperature changes. It’s very difficult to avoid either scalding yourself or freezing yourself. You turn, and nothing much happens, and so you turn more, and then, all of a sudden, you’re jumping out of the shower. That’s the kind of problem that the Fed has.*
* *The Fed should return to a much more modest framework around the objectives of price stability and full employment in the face of changing data. It should resist the broad idea of forward guidance, which I think is one of those elegant academic ideas that doesn’t work very well in practice because central banks don’t and can’t know what they’re going to do in the future. And so forward guidance is, the vast majority of the time, folly.*
* *I understand the decision to do a 0.75-percentage-point move as a significant policy step. But I still don’t believe that the Fed has realistic projections. In March, I said that the dot plot, which charts members’ individual rate forecasts, wasn’t remotely realistic. While \[the dots\] were significantly adjusted this time around, unfortunately* [*I still don’t think they are realistic*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-inflation-interest-rates-recession-51655330452?mod=article_inline)*. Why should anyone think that inflation is going to come down from the 8% range to the 2% range without unemployment rising above the Fed’s estimate of its normal rate, an estimate that is itself too low? My guess is that you will see further increases in projected inflation, projected unemployment, and projected interest rates.*

The number is 18% higher than in 2021.

The survey included 17 institutions, which together account for 82% of the country's banking assets. The main investments are contained in topics such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and open finance included in budgets such as blockchain.

According to media, this year part of the capital this year will go for DeFi decentralized economy projects, more precisely in pre-launch phase as LunaFi and Minosis Token, in addition potential startups will be funded.

Last year (2021), banks invested USD 6 million in technology, of which USD 2 million were in investments. Unlike 2021, banks will make more capital available for investments made in software. The research projects that the value will be around 58%. Expenditures with equipment should represent 27% of the total and IT services, 7%.

Also according to the survey, 53% of banks will invest this year in structures for remote work, which includes equipment, software and expenses with information security and cloud storage. In total, there should be R$ 46.4 million in investments.

Once a segment practiced by few companies, home office is already a reality for 15.8 million Brazilians. In the last year, banks have advanced in remote work not only in administrative areas, but also in branches. In 82% of the institutions surveyed, some form of remote work was adopted for employees in the units; 73% reduced their customer service hours, and 55% rotated teams.

Even with the growth of remote banking, 17.4 million people still do not have access to a bank branch in their region, according to Financial City Report.

Currently the 401k allows Traditional and Roth contributions, and offers a 5% match.  Since offered, I've made all my contributions into Roth, and I understand the company match goes in as Traditional.  Because of the time frames involved, my 401k is still roughly 80% Traditional, 20% Roth.  I hit the federal maximum every year.

Beginning July 1, the 401k will now also offer:

* After-Tax contributions
* Roth In-Plan Conversions
* An auto-conversion feature from After-Tax to Roth.

I have yet to go through the documents in detail.  The email included a link to a FAQ PDF.

Question 1:  Is this the Mega Backdoor Roth I keep hearing about?

I've opened the PF wiki section on After-Tax 401(k) Contributions to read later.

Question 2:  I have not converted any IRA monies to Roth due to issues with the Pro-Rata Rule.  In the situation where I have Traditional 401k monies, does a similar Pro-Rata rule impact my ability to make tax-free Roth conversions within the 401(k)?

Question 3:  I'm 56, and besides maxing out the 401k every year (including the catch-up contribution), I also invest 10% of my salary into VTSAX in a taxable investment account.  Would it be, in your opinion, wise to stop the VTSAX contributions and instead make use of what I think is the mega-back-door Roth?  Note that my employer 401k does not offer an investment like VTSAX.  It does offer:

* a series of target date funds (I'm not in them)

The problem is, it's a little tough to estimate exactly how much I'll make from this thing this year. It could turn into a really big income supplement, or just a few small paychecks and then fizzle out, depending on how things go.

Is this math right, at least until I get out of my current tax bracket? Taxes owed = 1099 Income x (15.3% (self-employment) + 12% (current federal income tax bracket) + 5.75% (current state income tax bracket))

Edit: Also, for calculating when I've crossed the threshold into the next tax bracket, I can effectively add the standard deduction to my income, right? i.e. As I am married filing jointly, I won't enter the 22% tax bracket until my income passes 106,950? (Since I'll have to be at $81,051 *after* subtracting the deduction.)

Edit again: Oh! And if I can deduct 50% of my SE taxes, does that essentially further increase the threshold before I cross into the next tax bracket?",finance,1655494754
stocks,JPOW’s plan to cancel the recession,"I’ve done a deep dive on JPOW’s press conference from 2 days ago. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not defending JPOW, I am just laying out his plan and position. 

We’ve all heard that JPOW believes a soft landing is possible. Meaning inflation will come down without rate hikes sparking a recession. People make fun of him without understanding his evidence or strategy. 

**Robust job growth**

JPOW laid out that in the past 3 months, employment has risen by an average 408,000 jobs. While less than before, it’s still a very strong number. 

There is a surplus of vacant jobs. This is evidence by stagnant labor participation that hasn’t changed since January. 

Jobs are increasing but labor participation is subdued. As a result, wages are high, unemployment is low. 

**Strong Consumer spending**

Consumer spending has not faltered according to JPOW. Demand is still high with low supply. The theory is, raising rates will lower demand. With lower demand, supply prices will go down. This comes with the assumption that non-commodity inflation has been caused by a supply crunch. 

JPOW contends, low consumer sentiment is a result of gas prices and the stock market. He sites unwavering consumer spending as proof that low sentiment is over gas prices and stocks. People are still spending for other things, they are just upset about gas prices and their worthless calls.

He admits retail sales have gone down. This is a result of consumption shifts because again, consumer spending did not go down. People are paying more for gas and less for retail products. While this isn’t great, it shows the consumer is still in a good financial position. Thus, the **“U.S. economy is in a strong position and well-positioned to deal with higher interest rates.”**

**Inflation** 

Inflation is bad and the fed knows it. Hence the more aggressive rate kick.

JPOW believes an eventual interest rate of 3.8%-4% will be enough to bring demand down. Yet, he is adaptable to higher or lower depending on how hot inflation runs. Now the question is, will lowering demand cause a recession or a soft landing?

**JPOW’s humility**

As I’ve delved deeper into this, it appears JPOW is not a confident as my title would lead you to believe. He is humble enough to admit that there are many factors that are out of the feds control. The Ukraine war, commodity prices, and supply issues are external factors that are unaffected by monetary policy. The hope is rather than supply meeting demand, demand will meet supply via higher interest rates. 

For example, Instead of increasing the supply of chips to meet demand, the fed aims to decrease the demand for chips so there’s no more imbalance. While it’s not guaranteed, when demand comes down, prices will hopefully come down. 

Many of you may be surprised to hear this but JPOW said himself: **“much of it is really not down to monetary policy”**

Monetary policy alone will not lead to a soft landing. External factors need to also line up to bring inflation to the feds goal of 2%.  

He can’t always make pie in the sky statements about how everything will workout. Acknowledging the precarious situation ultimately gives people more confidence in him. 

**Why won’t this cause a recession**

The fed projects that rate hikes will raise unemployment to 4.1%. JPOW argues that this increase in unemployment is still at a historically low level. He presents many other reasons like strong consumer spending, etc. Much of his reasoning have already been iterated above. 

This brings me to my most important conclusion:

**JPOW is the wizard of OZ**

Currently the public, according to JPOW, sees the fed as successfully able to bring inflation down to 2%. He specifically said “successful” in bringing down inflation. Previously he defined success as as a soft landing. Bringing down inflation at the cost of sparking a recession is not a soft landing. Therefore, the public must have confidence that the fed can make a soft landing for the soft landing to occur.           

He states, regarding public confidence in feds ability, **”It's absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence.”** This is why he argues tirelessly that the consumer is strong and the economy can withstand rate hikes. Public confidence that recession will not happen is key to preventing a recession. 

Markets are forward looking. It is not without merit that belief in a recession is a self fulfilling prophecy. Panic causes financial collapse more than anything else.

This is also the reason why Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she does not believe a recession will occur.

Public sentiment shifting towards recession expectations could be the tipping point that would prevent JPOW’s soft landing. 

TLDR: JPOW will cancel the recession by convincing people a recession will not happen.",finance,1655494807

solar,Federal Tax Credit,"Can we talk Federal Tax Credit (FTC)?  From what I understand its 26% of the total amount either in cash price or financed.  In the case of cash, the buyer pays for the solar array in the full amount and then gets the FTC when they file their taxes?  BUT only for what they owe on taxes?  And it can be used up to 5 years.  So, no you don't get a straight 26% discount, but a reduction in your taxes every year, for 5 years, until the 26% threshold is met?  Is that how this works?

If you finance, your monthly payment can either have the FTC applied to it or not.  If so, your monthly bill will be lower.  If not, your bill will be higher, but you get the tax credit applied to your taxes similarly to if you paid cash?  Is that correct?

Some places I've seen say it ""goes in your pocket"" which seems misleading.  Thy don't just cut you a check for $12,000 and say thanks for going solar.  Anyone have any input?  It's all very confusing but I think I got the gist.",energy,1655496477
CryptoCurrency,There are a lot of similarities right now to the bottom of the 2018 bear market. A look at the charts and numbers.,"In 2018, the bear market bottomed at around $3,200 for Bitcoin.

There was a lengthy period of crabbing above $6K, until the market tanked one last time to form the bottom.

Recently, we've had a lengthy period of crabbing around $30K. Until we finally tanked down a little above $20K.

I'll let the chart speak for itself:

&amp;#x200B;

[2018 bottom vs today](https://preview.redd.it/0256rifok8691.jpg?width=977&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0cdfe3be915dec05320bad8f07794e782ea6ea0)

Both drops are pretty significant. I'm not comparing a 45% drop to a 5% drop here.

In 2018, we went from point 1 to point 4 with a 45% dip. This year we dipped by 31%.

If you look at what happened after point 7 in 2018, you can see that the final bottom price happens afterwards.

So there is potential for one last drop in price.

If may not necessarily be the case this year, but if we follow the same pattern, then the expectation is that the final bottom will be a little lower before we bounce back.

Perhaps a brief visit to $19K to form the final bottom.

# How reliable is this theory? Will this actually happen?

Not necessarily.

This is only a theory.

Keep in mind I'm only comparing this to one point of data, which is never enough to confirm a pattern.

In 2015 we reached the bottom in a slightly different way:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Things you need to consider before jumping to a conclusion:

There are a lot of factors to consider.

No two market is exactly the same. So it's risky to expect things to play out exactly the same way.

We have a lot of differences with the last two bear markets. We have a different macro economic situation, which could suddenly and unpredictably improve or worsen.

If oil was to continue dipping, if GDP numbers improve, CPI numbers improve, or if the War in Ukraine was to fizzle out or end, then we could have an improving situation.

If those things continue to worsen, or if something like the housing bubble pops, then things could get much worse.

At the same time, you can't rely too much on macros to predict prices.

Markets are also driven by speculative supply and demand, and sometimes even run more on emotions and irrationality. And they can deviate from macros. 

Crypto markets could also decouple again, and go back to their pre-covid low correlation to stocks. We have been coupled to stocks mainly since the Fed have been injecting extra liquidity. But now that it's gone, we could decouple again. And the statistical correlation has recently started to drop.

It's important to take all that information into consideration.

And always look at the data before the narrative.

The difficult part, is there is a lot of data and a lot of moving parts to consider. And they are not all moving in a synchronized way.

Consider all of this before jumping to any conclusions.",cryptocurrency,1655496757
personalfinance,"Age 32, new 30Y mortgage - pay off principal vs investing (buy the dip)?","Hi everyone,

My wife and I are trying to figure out how to invest our extra cash. We are both fortunate to be young physicians out of residency, age 30-33. We have no debt and no plans for children. We anticipate having $6,000/mo combined to put into savings. We've already built an emergency fund. We already are maxed-out on our 401k contributions. We just started a 30-year mortgage on a $1,650,000 townhome at a fixed interest rate of 2.7% after making a $340,000 down payment. Our property tax is 1%. 

Our question is whether it makes more sense to put this $6,000/mo into a brokerage account (with a Bogleheads strategy) every month, or put it toward paying off the principle on our mortgage. We noticed on the debt amortization schedule that the first many years of the mortgage, the monthly payment goes more toward the interest than the principle. 

I want to double-check my reasoning here: If we apply the $6,000/mo to the principle, we can greatly shorten the time of our mortgage and avoid paying much of the interest. This savings could even be greater than simply putting the money toward the stock market via a brokerage account. We would lose out on some itemized tax deductions on our mortgage interest, but this would not be that much of a loss. That being said, it looks like the economy may be heading for a recession and, at my age, this could be a good opportunity to buy the dip. 

Any ideas on whether to put the money toward the stock market vs my mortgage principle? Overall I'd describe my risk tolerance as low-medium. Thank you!",finance,1655497741

# **Look for more selling pressure next week as investors learn the hard way not to fight the Fed - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/17/look-for-more-selling-pressure-next-week-as-investors-learn-the-hard-way-not-to-fight-the-fed.html)**
*****
&gt; Wall Street and the Federal Reserve appeared to enter a new reality this week, and the result for investors was big losses with no obvious end point in sight.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is on its way to its 10th down week in the last 11, and is now well into a bear market. On Thursday, all 11 of its sectors closed more than 10% below their recent highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 30,000 for the first time since January 2021.
*****
&gt; Unlike recent drawdowns for stocks, however, the central bank will not be putting a bottom in the market. Instead, the Fed raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday — its biggest since 1994 — and signaled continued tightening ahead. Powell will testify before Congress next week and is expected to hold firm on his plan for a more aggressive Fed until inflation is brought to heel.
*****
&gt; Bank of America equity strategist Ajay Singh Kapur said in a note to clients on Friday that it is time for investors to stop fighting the Fed and give up the buy-the-dip mentality.
*****
&gt; “In a bear market, heroism is punished. Valor is unnecessary, and cowardice is called for in portfolio construction — that is the way to preserve capital and live to fight another day, waiting for the next central bank panic, and better valuations and a new earnings upcycle,” Kapur wrote.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, have been hit particularly hard, as have cyclical plays such as airlines and cruise lines.
*****
&gt; But the dramatic declines have not been limited to stocks. B/itcoin dropped more than 30% in a week amid reports about blowups of c/rypto-focused trading firms. Treasury yields, which move opposite of bond prices, have spiked.
*****
&gt; Markets briefly rallied on Wednesday afternoon after the Fed’s announcement, but that optimism was quickly dashed and the gains reversed on Thursday. Many strategists are warning that markets and sentiment could have further to fall, pointing to Wall Street earnings estimates that curiously still show solid growth in the coming year.
*****
&gt; “These people need to fight inflation as fast as possible and as hard as possible. And the market has consistently been behind the curve on trying to understand how aggressive this Fed was going to be,” said Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors.
*****
&gt; # Recession ahead?
&gt; The impact of the Fed’s rate hikes on the market has been magnified by deteriorating economic data, as investors and strategists appear to be losing confidence in the central bank’s ability to achieve a soft landing.
*****
&gt; The housing market appears to be cooling rapidly, with housing starts and mortgage applications plummeting. Consumer sentiment is plumbing record lows. Jobless claims are beginning to trend higher as reports of layoffs at tech firms grow. And all oil prices show no signs of falling back below $100 per barrel as the summer travel season kicks off.
*****
&gt; In a note to clients on Friday, Bank of America global economist Ethan Harris described the U.S. economy as “one revision away from recession.”
*****
&gt; “Our worst fears around the Fed have been confirmed: they fell way behind the curve and are now playing a dangerous game of catch up. We look for GDP growth to slow to almost zero, inflation to settle at around 3% and the Fed to hike rates above 4%,” Harris wrote.
*****
&gt; Even among more optimistic economists, the outlook calls for a rather bumpy landing. JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli said in a note Friday that he expected Powell to be “largely successful” in balancing fighting inflation with economic growth, but a recession is a distinct possibility.
*****
&gt; “This desired soft landing is not guaranteed, and Fed chair Powell himself has noted that achieving this goal may not be entirely straightforward. And with a tight labor market and the economy dealing with the shocks of tighter financial conditions and higher food and energy prices, recession risks are notable as we think about the next few years,” Feroli wrote. “Our models point to 63% chance of recession over the next two years and 81% odds that a recession starts over the next three.”
*****
&gt; # Coming up
&gt; Powell will be in the hot seat again next week, as he returns to Capitol Hill to testify before both houses of Congress, and he is unlikely to soften his stance over the weekend.
*****
&gt; The Fed Chair said on Wednesday that he and his committee members were “absolutely determined” to keep inflation expectations from rising. The central bank said in a report to Congress on Friday ahead of the hearings that its commitment to price stability is “unconditional.”
*****
&gt; Inflation has risen to a top political issue, as well as an economic one, and the Fed’s raised forecast for unemployment could also come under scrutiny from lawmakers.
*****
&gt; “As they’re going to 2.5%, 3.5% [Fed funds rate], if the economy is slowing toward a recession, I don’t think they’re going to stand on the throat of the economy to get inflation to go down,” said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist for PGIM Fixed Income. ”...Otherwise, in order to get inflation down from 3.5% to 2%, you’re going to have to lose your job. That’s going to be the message: We’re going to have to get some job losses and recession. And I don’t think that trade-off is going to be worth it for them.”
*****
&gt; On Friday, investors will get an updated consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan. That measure has now taken on increased significance after Powell pointed to it this week as one of the reasons the Fed decided to raise its rate hike this month.
*****
&gt; The survey’s preliminary reading for June showed a record low for sentiment, and confirmation of that number — or even further deterioration — would likely serve as further proof that the Fed will not waver in the coming months. The inflation expectations part of the survey, which rose in the preliminary reading, will be watched closely.
*****
&gt; Outside of those events, next week is relatively light for economic events, with U.S. stock markets closed on Monday for Juneteenth. Investors will be looking for insight into the U.S. economy in earnings reports from a few bellwether stocks, such as Lennar on Tuesday and FedEx on Thursday.

&gt; # 7 Things To Know Now That The Bear Is Here

&gt; It finally happened. On Monday the S&amp;P 500 Index moved into a bear market, finally closing 20% beneath the January 3 high.

&gt; Here are 7 things to know about bear (and bull) markets:

&gt; * Since World War II seven bull markets have officially doubled. The recent bull market was the fastest to ever double, but it also ended much quicker than the others at less than two years old.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blog-1-1.png))**

&gt; 2) The bull market that just ended lasted only 21 months from the March 2020 lows until the January 2022 peak, checking in as the shortest bull market since WWII. As noted above though, it was also the quickest to ever double. Wow.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-2.png))**

&gt; 3) Here are all the bear (and near bear markets) since 1950. “This bear market is actually already old by recent standards,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “At more than five months old, it is already older than six other bear markets going back nearly 40 years. Only the tech bubble and Great Financial Crisis bears lasted longer.”

&gt; This could mean the bear market could be closer to a bottom than many expect.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blog-3.png))**

&gt; 4) What could happen next? As we show in the LPL Research Chart of the Day, the good news is a year after the S&amp;P 500 moves into a bear, stocks actually do pretty well, up an average of nearly 15% a year later with a very solid median gain of 23.8%.

&gt; The catch, and there’s always a catch, the returns a year later were negative in the 1973-74 recession, the tech bubble, and the Financial Crisis (2008-2009). The good news is we don’t see an economy like that over the next year, so the likelihood of higher prices (maybe significantly higher) is quite strong, in our view.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-4.jpg))**

&gt; 5) How quickly could stocks bottom once a bear starts? The data is all over the map here. It took only 11 days in March 2020 for the lows to form, while it took 18 months after the tech bubble. Bottom line, we think this could play out more like things did in 1987 or the 1950s and 1960s with the ultimate low taking place sooner rather than later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-6.png))**

&gt; 6) Looking at previous bears that took place without a recession (still our base case), showed that stocks tend to bottom at a little more than down 20%. Yes, 1987 is in there, but most of the other times stocks bottomed near where we are now, suggesting potentially limited pain from current levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-7.png))**

&gt; 7) Investors need to remember that since the S&amp;P 500 Index moved to 500 stocks on March 4, 1957, it has made 1,184 new all-time highs and it has always eventually achieved new highs, even if it doesn’t feel that way today. Wars, sky-high inflation, recessions, bubbles, 100 year pandemics, geopolitical events, policy mistakes, and more have all happened over this time, but stocks have always come back eventually to new highs. We do not think this time will be any different. As long as businesses can grow earnings over the long run, the fundamentals are in place for future stock gains, which means new highs could be coming as well.

&gt; They say the stock market is the only place things go on sale and people run out of the store screaming. Please remember that before you make any rash investment decisions.

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 was just down more than 1% for four consecutive days. This very rare occurrence hasn’t been fun for investors, but be aware the returns after these painful streaks have been very strong, higher a year later 9 out of 9 times, with a solid 26.7% gain on average. Additionally, each consecutive day saw a larger loss than the previous during the four day streak. That has only happened two other times in history, in March 2009 and December 2018. Those weren’t the worst times to be looking for opportunities.

&gt; # Market Prone to Late June Weakness

&gt; June is not a great month for the market in general. It’s even weaker in midterm years. But the week after June Triple Witching is horrendous. Down Triple Witching Weeks also tend to trigger more weakness the week after.

&gt; But with S&amp;P 500 down 10 of the last 11 weeks and down 11.3% to date, which would be the second worst June ever behind 1930, perhaps some of the usual end-of-Q2 carnage has been pulled forward.

&gt; Any perceived improvement inflation, Russia/Ukraine war or supply chains would be welcomed by the market. With the bear on the loose caution and patience remain the best course of action. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads! Hit ‘em Straight!

&gt; # History of bear markets points to an October 2022 bottom

&gt; On Monday of this week DJIA fell into an official Ned Davis Research (NDR) bear market. This raises the question, “Where can we go from here?” In the table above we examine all the 13% DJIA declines after 145 days since 1948 and the subsequent action after. The four 30% Value Line Geometric reversal bear markets in 1987, 1990, 1998 and 2020 are included for reference.

&gt; Of the eighteen others only the two reached bottom at the 13%, 145-day decline, 1953 and 2016. Eight were followed by further declines of less than 10% and eight greater. Twelve bottomed out less than three months later and six dragged on for 6 months or more. The average additional decline was 12.4% over an average of 139 calendar days. Based upon DJIA’s close on June 13 and these averages, DJIA could ultimately find bottom around October 31, 2022, at 26732.13. This would represent a total bear market decline of 27.4% in 298 calendar days.

&gt; # Sentiment Staying Low

&gt; More hawkish monetary policy and the S&amp;P 500 hitting the bear market threshold have given sentiment plenty of reason to turn lower, and that's exactly what has happened. After reaching a short-term high of 32% only two weeks ago, the percentage of respondents to the AAII survey considering themselves bullish has fallen back below 20% this week. That may not be as extreme of reading as those in the mid-teens from back in April, but, it is still a historically low reading and in the bottom 2% of all weeks going back to the start of the survey in 1987.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/061622-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; While bullish sentiment has declined, this week's 1.6 percentage point decline was actually much smaller than the 11 percentage point drop last week. An even bigger decline occurred for those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading fell 9.9 percentage points from a recent high of 32.1%. Now at 22.2%, the percentage of neutral respondents is back down to the lowest level since the start of May.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/061622-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; With both bullish and neutral sentiment falling, the bearish camp picked up the difference. Heading into this week, bearish sentiment was already elevated at 46.9%. The 11.4 percentage point bump this week means that well over half of respondents are now bearish with the current reading just 1.1 percentage points shy of the 59.4% high from the end of April. That ranks as the eleventh highest reading of all weeks on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/061622-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; That also means the percentage of bears outweighs bulls by an astounding 38.9 percentage points and is the lowest reading since the last week of April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/061622-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Not only do bears outweigh bulls by a large margin, but it has also been a historically long length of time that this has been the case. Smoothing out the reading by taking a four-week moving average of the bull-bear spread, the average has been below -10 (in other words on average over a four-week span bearish sentiment has been at least 10 percentage points higher than bullish sentiment) for 21 straight weeks. That surpassed another long 18-week streak in 2020 and is now only five weeks short of the record stretch of 26 weeks in the early 1990s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/061622-AAII-6.png))**

&gt; Not only has the AAII survey showed souring sentiment, but so too have the weekly NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence surveys. This week, the NAAIM index showed investment managers only have 32.2% long equity exposure. Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence survey saw the most negative bull-bear spread in a month. Normalizing each of these three sentiment indicators, the average reading is now 1.28 standard deviations from the historical norm. That is not as bad as last month, but it remains a historically pessimistic reading on sentiment.

&gt; # Asset Class Performance During QT

&gt; As mentioned in our piece from earlier today, gold did not necessarily deliver superior performance during the last QT cycle. This leaves investors to ponder: which asset classes did deliver substantial returns? Is there anywhere to hide? Although the macroenvironment is vastly different this time around, it is still helpful to look at past occurrences to attempt to put a frame of reference around today's markets. Major differences include rampant inflation (particularly in commodities), supply chain constraints, lapping stimulus benefits, and weakening economic data. Below, we summarize the performance of the S&amp;P 500, bonds, agricultural commodities, and oil during previous QT cycles.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 outperformed Gold during the last QT cycle, gaining 19.2%, which constitutes an annualized return of 10.1%. The graph below outlines the performance of the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) during different cycles of QE and QT. As you can see, equities were not particularly steady during the last QT cycle, but SPY gained significantly after the Fed announced its intent to slow the balance sheet winddown.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/SPY-during-quantitative-cycles-061422.png))**

&gt; In the last QT cycle, the bond market initially sold off but managed to finish higher for the entire period. The iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) bottomed at a drawdown of 4.7% about a year after the cycle began but proceeded to gain 6.7% through the final 203 trading days of the cycle. When all was said and done, AGG finished the cycle with gains of 1.7%. Similar to what we saw in gold, much of the gains were seen after the Fed announced its plan to slow the wind-down of the balance sheet. This suggests that rates rose at first but then reversed course when the Fed announced the impending end of QT. So far in the current cycle, AGG has already dropped by 2.7%, but bonds sold off hard in anticipation of QT in late 2021 and early 2022. On a YTD basis, the ETF is down a whopping 12.7%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/AGG-QT-and-QE-cycles-061422.png))**

&gt; Agricultural commodities performed poorly during the last QT cycle, dropping 15.7%. This constitutes an annualized return of -8.9%, but the broader agricultural space was in a downtrend before QT began. Currently, agricultural commodities are in an uptrend, so it will be interesting to watch the price action as QT ramps up. On a YTD basis, the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA) is up 10.2% and is essentially flat since QT began in early May.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/DBA-during-last-tightening-cycle-061422.png))**

&gt; During the last QT cycle, crude oil gained 15.8%, but it would be difficult to attribute these gains to quantitative tightening. Since the Fed began tightening this year, crude oil has jumped 16.0% higher. In the last cycle, oil rallied higher before subsequently crashing, which would certainly be welcomed by many in this cycle.

&gt; # DJIA is officially in a bear market

&gt; For years we have relied upon the Ned Davis Research definition of bear and bull markets. An official bear market requires a 30% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. The drop is measured from peak to trough and both price and time criteria must be met. At today’s close it has been 160 calendar days since DJIA’s peak on January 4, DJIA is down 17.1% and at a new closing low which meets the parameters.

&gt; Inflation is stubbornly remaining at multi-decade highs, the Fed is tightening, sentiment is bearish, support levels are not holding, supply chain disruptions persist, there is conflict in Europe and energy prices are at record highs for consumers. Continue to be patient as the Weak Spot of the four-year-cycle will eventually give way to the Sweet Spot, likely sometime later in Q3 or in early Q4. Even with inflation at multi-decade highs, cash is likely the least dangerous place to wait.

&gt; # Weak May Housing Data

&gt; Earlier this week, we highlighted the fact that mortgage activity had fallen off a cliff due to a historic rise in rates. This is an important factor to keep in mind as the housing market tends to be a strong leading indicator for recessions, as every recession besides the COVID crash since the early 1960s has been preceded by a pronounced decline in Housing Starts. Although the NAHB index has already rolled over substantially, Housing Starts and Building Permits are yet to drop on a trailing twelve-month basis. However, the data has been showing signs of weakness, as we have now seen two consecutive months of declines in permits and a significant month-over-month fall in starts.

&gt; The table below breaks down this month's report by type of unit and region and shows both the month-over-month and year-over-year changes. Contrary to what we saw last month, Housing Starts moved higher in the Northeast and Midwest on a m/m basis, while the South and West saw dramatic declines. On a y/y basis, only the Northeast (smallest of the four regions) saw starts move higher. In aggregate, Housing Starts fell by 14.4% month over month and 3.5% year over year. Although multi-units fell more than single units, the decline was substantial for both. In terms of permits, there was no positivity in sight, as every region saw m/m declines. This is not a positive sign for future starts data, as permits must be issued before starts can occur. In aggregate, Building Permits fell by 7.0% month over month, driven by a massive decline in the Northeast.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/Housing-starts-and-permits-061622-table.png))**

&gt; For the first time since February of 2021, the 12-month average of Housing Starts declined on a m/m basis. A rollover in this figure tends to be a strong recession indicator, which based on prior history would suggest that the economy is not yet in a recession. If this data continues to weaken, though. recession alarms will start ringing.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/Average-housing-starts-rollover-061622.png))**

&gt; The charts below show the rolling 12-month average for Housing Starts and Building Permits since 2010 on both an overall basis (top chart) and for single-family units specifically (bottom chart). Overall, the 12-month average for headline starts and permits has experienced headwinds as of late with the rate of increase for both slowing down and starts actually showing a slight decline. The trend for single-family units, however, is much more divergent as permits have already started to roll over after peaking last summer while single-family starts have essentially leveled off during that same span.

personalfinance,Financing $63k at 1.99% or paying cash with 20% discount,"Hey everyone. I have a question about whether it makes more sense for my parents to buy or finance solar panel installation on the roof of their house. The overall cost comes out to about $63k for the whole system. They are able to lock in a rate to finance this loan at 1.99% APR and pay it off over 25 years, monthly payment according to the company would be around $190. There is also an option for them to pay cash, which they do have on hand, in which case they would be eligible for a 20% discount on the entire system, which comes out to closer to $50k as a lump sum. I know the typical advice on this sub is that investing is usually the better option when the interest rate is as low as this, but I'm wondering if the 20% discount would offset that benefit at all. Another thing to note is that, though I have told them many times not to let their money sit in savings (suggesting they look into index funds or at least a hysa), it's likely that it will sit in a savings account earning a fraction of a percent per year unless I continue to try to convince them otherwise, if they choose to finance.

When we’re looking at where to be putting a few extra hundred dollars every month and weighing the most efficient method. 

We already have 6 month EF and he’s already contributing enough to get his full match at work. No other high interest debt. 

I know in normal times, 4.59% seems on the cusp but probably would make more sense to pay down rather than invest. In this time of high inflation over 8%+ though, it seems like it changes the ROI on that payoff and seems almost silly to pay off a loan with a rate lower than inflation even. 

On the other hand, with where the stock market is, I’m sure he’d probably be getting a negative ROI in the short term - but if we’re looking at a 40 year time span, I’d expect a better return than the loan rate regardless of inflation. Not trying to time the market but when inflation settles down, we could always switch to paying off the debt more quickly.

economy,Historical 10 Yr Yield vs. Unemployment vs. CPI -&gt; Future Outlook,"Hi all,

I made the graph below using historical Core CPI, unemployment, and 10-year yields going back to 1985.

https://preview.redd.it/pulo3cpwv9691.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb950ea152410557afd594146d30ae137e0f13ca

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, at no point since 1985 has inflation been so high not to mention how low unemployment is relative to historical data. While some may argue that this inflation is transitory, I ask to what extent? Core CPI already excludes energy and food prices affected by the War in Ukraine. While transportation costs for other goods and global lockdowns from COVID-19 may be to blame for a partial amount of inflation, I cannot foresee a scenario where rates do not climb substantially higher in the coming 12 months.

Additionally, I calculated the correlation between each of the variables finding a negative correlation (\~-0.052) to unemployment and a positive correlation (\~0.674) to Core CPI. This indicates a much higher emphasis from the Fed on fighting inflation rather than combatting unemployment in recent history.

A counterargument that has been brought up previously is external pressure from the federal government to keep rates low to allow for continued cheap borrowing. Government spending would have to be slashed dramatically if rates were to rise anywhere close to where they were even in the 2000s. 

I am happy to hear any insight from others into why rates will not rise significantly. Thank you!",finance,1655511534

But yet we see massive sell offs from apparently emotional people who can't handle the pressure causing the price to collapse. I'm now starting to wonder whether holding is really the best strategy. I made a profit of a few thousand profit at it's peak before the announcements of interest rates. Now I knew shares were going to fall and they've been falling since as interest rates keep increasing. Again, not surprising, everyone saw this coming. But yet because I've been conditioned to just hold, I did. Now I'm thinking wouldn't it be better to sell now, take the profits and re-invest a few months later? I understand this is about timing the market, but the general consensus is/was what I mentioned before happening. Is holding really what investment firms and rich people do or is it just for us?

personalfinance,Started new job. Old job 401k needs to be taken care of.,"Hi, so I started a new job recently. I was at my old company for working part time for 4.5 years, and have a modest 401k. My new job is working contract to hire, so I do not have any options for rolling over my 401k. Also note that approximately 60% of the total 401k is held in the companies stock, which is not publicly traded. Because of this I can only roll this over to very specific retirement plans. 

I am trying to understand the tax implications of taking a lump sum disbursement, vs rolling this into a ""Traditional IRA"", as the pamphlet states is the only retirement plan that will accept non-publicly traded stock. I understand that there are tax penalties that I would have to pay if I take a lump disbursement. My initial plan was to take the disbursement for the stock that is not publicly traded, and roll over the other stocks into a new retirement plan. I was thinking a Roth IRA, but I have not done my research, so I'm not exactly sure what type I would chose.

The pamphlet that I received from my old company states ""If you choose to have your plan benefits paid in cash directly to you, you will receive only 80% of the current accumulated balance because the plan administrator is required to withhold 20% of the payment and send it to the IRS as income tax withholding that will be credited against your federal income taxes."" I was also under the impression that there is a 10% tax penalty for early disbursements of 401k accounts. 

So, if I'm understanding correctly, I would lose 20% that is withheld and sent to the IRS, then I would be taxed 10% on top of that? is that correct? Does the 20% withheld go towards my taxes, or add onto how much I owe for taxes? Confused on the wording.

Bitcoin,June 17 - 2022. - BTC &amp; Crypto is dead…,"I’ve read the BTC standard. Read so many positive posts over the last 24 months. Gone back to links from previous bear cycles and winters. SO many people hating and nay saying on BTC these days. Seems similar to days of old. Lots of “we haven’t seen this before” remarks. inflation/recession/interest rate+/ you name it. 

Have to be honest though, lots of people talking about never reaching below previous ATH or pre-halving lows.

in other words lots of capitulation and doubt these days. 

Here are my concerns and please prove my points wrong because there are some flaws and issues I see going forward. 

- BTC falls below halving ATH. Issue? Why? Support falls out and it dumps? Why would it not recover like previous cycles?
- Adoption - failing? price dump fucks over el Hodledor? do collapses of these economy put a black stain on BTC that’s unrecoverable? are we all using BTC wrong by holding as investment and not spending as $? Do we have to wait for hypernization and it to be worth millions+ s Saylor says for it to lose volatility and stabilize? How do we overcome this issue?
- Quantum computing - endangers Crypto in general- obvious threat.
- regulation- looking favourable. Assuming it’s property/currency what is the issue here? 
- govts issue CBDC’s(no better/worse than Fiat) and the convince the world it’s better than BTC. 

The long of the short is - if the fundamentals (more users, more adoption, stronger network, etc) are happening (are they?) how do we fail?

I see so many people who are smarte than me arguing about fundamentals of money and economic Systems like Keynes V the Austrians and there are pros/cons to both. So how do we move forward from here? Is this shit viable or a pipe dream? Please no Buttcoin BS comments. 

For context I’m a guy who’s read BTC standard and done probably 100 hours research on the subject. 

Please discuss.",cryptocurrency,1655519874
stocks,A history-based advice to new (or over-confident) investors,"I know still quite some people (particularly new investors) are itching to get into the market to buy the dip/bottom. We also see advice from people with enticing lines [like this](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/u-s-stock-crash-is-huge-opportunity-to-cash-in-top-investor/ar-AAYAx9J): ""U.S. stock crash could present Americans with a ""monstrous"" opportunity when looking at the economy from a long-term perspective"".

Now my advice is: Don't listen to them. Instead, what you should do is two things: 1. Be patient. 2. Wait for clarity in economy and fiscal policies. Then you put your money into the market. Yes, you might miss the bottom, but you would avoid a lot of pain.

If you don't believe me, at least believe the history. In the last 22 years, Nasdaq pulled back 35% three times before this year:

1. 2000. Nasdaq peaked at 5132 in early March 2000, dived 40%+ the next 2.5 months. If you had bought in then like you're considering now, even if you bought exactly at the local bottom, you'd be looking at another nearly 2.5 years of pain with a further 63% loss from your purchase before Nasdaq finally bottomed. But if you had just waited for clarity, even if you missed the bottom by 3 months, you would still be up 678% from your purchase point to now! Had you bought when Nasdaq was 40% down, your gain over the same period was 255% (edit: it's not the same period, it's actually almost 2.5 years longer with less return). Yes, a big difference.
2. 2008. Nasdaq peaked at 2862 in Oct 2007, dived 25% the next 5 months. If you had bought in then at the local bottom, you'd be looking at another 1 year of pain with a further 41% loss from your purchase before Nasdaq finally bottomed. But if you waited for clarity and missed the bottom by 3 months, you would still be up 484% from your purchase point to now! Had you bought when Nasdaq dropped to local bottom after 5 months and 25%, your gain over the same period was 401% (edit: it's not the same period, it's actually 1 year longer but with less return), still not as good as when you had waited.
3. 2020. Nasdaq bottomed after just a month and 35% drop. If you bought exactly at the bottom vs 3 months later, then you'd gain 62% vs 9%. This time buying the bottom won because: 1. We assumed you actually bought at the bottom. 2. We assumed that the alternative is that you missed bottom by 3 months long. 3. Most importantly, 2020 was so different than the other 3 times, namely 2000, 2008 and 2022, because in 2020 the global governments all went super easy on fiscal policies, flooding the market with liquidity, which caused the problem now. 2020 was an aberration that has less historical parallel or usefulness as a lesson.

So clearly I'm arguing again for my rules based on both reasoning and historical support:

1. Be patient.
2. Wait for clarity in economy and fiscal/monetary policies. If you watch news and sentiments, you probably can see it less than 3 months post bottom and catch most of the gains.
3. Then you put your money into the market.

That's it. You'll make good/better money without having to endure the stress and pain for months or years first. Follow my rules and you'll thank me later. :)

Yes you can argue for DCA, but that's not the active investing we're talking about here. And DCA would still have been in for a long period of pain in 2000 and 2008 with quite likely a worse return.

Edit: How to watch out for clarity? If you're not experienced, just watch the Feds and the market. When they pivot on their stance to clearly more dovish, it will help the economy and the stock market. They won't pivot unless there's clear signs that the worst inflation is over. Yes - economy could've been hurt then, and quite likely so. But stock market is forward looking and will react. The local bottom before the dovish fiscal policy will quite possibly be the actual bottom. Of course there's no fail safe method to absolutely catch the bottom - but it's surely better than buying too much earlier than the bottom!

Further edit: Since so many mentioned ""you don't time the market"" or ""what if you missed gains"" as they didn't notice my replies in comments, I'll explain here:

1. Every pro times the market and they should. You don't believe that, you've been played. For example, Buffett says he doesn't time the market. He lied. He doesn't like cash yet he's accumulating cash before recessions - investing afterward. He called it value investing but his adjustments to cash% were timing the market based on valuation. Pelosi and the Feds were even timing the market LOL. Plenty of retail investors adjust their portfolio to dodge the market turbulence too. It's all timing. I'm just advocating timing based on improvements in economy and fiscal policies.
2. It's fine to miss gains when you try to avoid loss. What's worse? Losing principal or missing gains? If you don't know the answer to this, you shouldn't be actively investing. In the examples in my OP, I also used missing the bottom by 3 months as the example, which means in 2000 and 2008 you would've missed 17% and 41% of gains already but you'd still come out ahead. For those people who just trust DCA more, I already stated - it's not the best active investing strategy. It's NOT even active investing. And DCA in 2000 and 2008 would've been in for long periods of pain with likely worse return anyhow unless your DCA timed the bottom relatively well. Otherwise your DCA could run out of money much earlier than the bottom - which is 2000 and 2008's cases were at least a year away - and generate a worse return. If you design your DCA based on when market might possibly bottom - Aha! You're timing the market, your DCA is now an oxymoron! LOL

Last Edit: To the DCA fans that can still think: Listen, let's first make it clear (if any of you couldn't figure it out from my post above already), my advice is clearly talking about the cash you saved and is ready for invest right now. I advocate for holding for clarity as I think that would beat the market - as I said above, in the previous instances, the strategy did beat the market. But of course DCA fans say DCA now, it's the only way to earn money in some people's eyes. So a few simple points for your consideration:

1. DCA works not as good as just invest everything you have in a bull market. I hope I don't need to explain the simple math here. My advice beats DCA since it attempts to dodge the bear market and just let money ride the bulls market or up-n-down market fluctuations.
2. In a fluctuating market, depending on the fluctuation and your DCA frequency, DCA could be a bit ahead or behind market. So my advice is as good as DCA in this case.
3. Finally let's consider bear market. First, you couldn't have been timing the market to do your DCA, otherwise you defiled your own principal and sabotaged your argument. So assuming at or near the peak of the market, you had $10K, based on your principal of not timing the market, you must have started DCA already and DCA-ed your way down. So how did you do your DCA? Don't tell me you've DCAed in your 401K, that's irrelevant as, again, my advice is about the cash ready to be invested NOW - In comment below for 401K I advocated people continuously put money in there. So let's say you DCA the $10K in 4 batches every month. Then starting from near the peak in Nov. 2021, you already ran out of the $10K and are now down 20% for Nasdaq or 12% for S&amp;P. I pulled out of the market late Sept and the cash is earning 0%, easily beating DCA. So let's say you DCA the $10K in 10 batches, my question is: how do you know that would beat my advice when my cash is around 12-20% ahead of you already? If market bounces back slowly, it'd take a while for you to even break even. Even if I miss the bottom, I beat your DCA easily. To beat my advice, you need to time your DCA to the downturn length well to be able to beat people trying to time the market - and using the methods I said above, this simple timing has a better winning chance than blindly DCA because most of the DCA plans are already down and might continue to lag further behind cash.

OK enough about DCA. For the CFA that trashed my post: I'm sorry but please don't make CFA sound like a special qualification. I've used 3 CFAs over the last 10 years, they all were significantly behind my own management of my brokerage account, one lagged far behind the bull market, another was still behind my own managing, and the last one lost significant amount of money during 2017-2018, mostly during the near-bear market in 2018. CFAs lose money too and a lot of them give bad advice. The CFA title alone does not give your any special power in any debate about investing, if not making it worse. HF managers are stronger than CFAs in investing and they lag the market.

Finally - no one's forcing you to take the advice, and I have yet to see anyone providing a concrete argument against my advice. Saying DCA without details means nothing - because as I detailed above, how and when you DCA make a huge difference, so you essentially still have to time the market - again, an oxymoron of a method.

I won't waste more time preaching to deaf ears. People could have earned 44% in the last month listening to my advice that I posted for the first time on r/stocks (I only posted on that stock's own subreddit before because I know how biased people are and didn't want to post here unless I was quite sure of the short term actions, and I was totally right) instead of losing 7% with Nasdaq or S&amp;P over the past month. But well, people chose not to listen. I guess there're just too many people too arrogant for their own good on this subreddit. I'll stop posting here. This post won't make me any money and my time spent here is purely for people's own good, but was met with some ridiculous detraction.

personalfinance,"Underwriter for a mortgage taking a bit too long, should I be worried?","Hey folks,

Its been over a week since we submitted the loan to underwriting and I have not heard back yet. I already have a preapproval in place as of a month ago (interest rate relatively similar), and the only change was a sharp drop in my 401k due to the bear market turn.

Down payment: 335,000 (60k of which was a gift not factored into preapproval)Locked interest rate: 4.8% aprProjected monthly payment (Mortgage + taxes + insurance) \~4800$

Preapproval amount : 1,100,000 a month agoChanges to my financial status since preapproval : 401k balance dropped from 400k to 200kAppraisal: Due in 3 days

I am primarily concerned whether such a large drop in my 401k balance can be the deciding factor between UW approval vs rejection. Should I be prepared to have a parent cosign the loan? 7 days seems like a long time and given the market doing absolutely terrible I am getting quite nervous.

Been losing a decent amount of sleep and stressing out over the home purchase. Me and girlfriend are both in love with the home and after living in our condo for over several years we have our eyes set on this one. Any words of advice or info here helps, and I'll happily award the top post here with some gold as the peace of mind it would give me would be tremendous!

personalfinance,Is it wrong for me to spend my inheritance like this?,"I am in my early 20s, a full time senior undergrad pre-med student with minimal debt (10k of subsidized federal loans), and I recieved an inheritence from a close, decreased family member of approximately $500,000 in cash. I've been doing my due diligence of learning as much as I can about being financially literate (particularly because of my future career choice) and I feel like this is a huge boost in my ultimate financial goal of becoming a multimillionaire through long-term investments. However, I have an internal struggle with how I think I should use the inheritance. This is mostly because I want to honor my loved one and their legacy they passed down to me, both through the life lessons they taught me and financially. 

On paper, I feel like the objectively ""best"" way to handle this situation is to continue living exactly as I am now, working as much as possible, while also trying to claw my way through the last of my undergrad work. That way I treat the inheritance like it wasn't there, take out 6 months of expenses as a liquid emergency fund, and put the rest in a well-balanced mutual fund portfolio. 

Another part of me feels like, as hard-working and dedicated of a person as I am, this windfall is a blessing. In effect, I could take this as a heavy aid to my schooling and current position in life. What I mean by that is I feel like I could use this opportunity to focus on myself and my studies exclusively, reducing my working hours substantially (not necessarily entirely) and making the most of my education without worrying about making ends meet. I also have close family I could spend more time with and my fiancé, opening up time in my life more for them before medical school sucks me back into a world of non-stop work (at least until I'm through residency and get to my goal of private-practice). I only mention this part because spending time with my family is a huge aid to personal motivation and mental health quality, and also why I care so much about honoring my loved one's legacy.

At a minimum, I know I want to invest a majority of the inheritance in both scenarios. But, in the latter scenario, my fiancé feels similarly in that I could get a great head-start to my late 20s and early 30s that most people don't get. For example, I could ""cruise"" through the rest of my education, without worrying about paying most bills due to living off of investment returns. I could also consider upgrading from my 1995 college car to something modern, nice, and reliable to get me through the next big stages in my life (in the $35,000 range). Investing in more expensive MCAT test prep, taking proper time to relax by doing some more expensive things I like (like trips to museums, aquariums, historical/state park road trips, etc.) are also on the list. Additionally, I think it's important to note that my fiancé does not have any ill-intentions or expectations about the situation. We are still splitting all bills and resources in our lives 50/50 as we always have (but that doesn't mean I won't treat him here and there out of my own good will, like I typically do).

I feel the differences between spending too much, ""treating myself"" and ""taking care of myself"" are very small in this scenario, and it honestly scares me. I'm terrified of making a bad decision and being stuck feeling like I let my loved one down. At the same time, I know no matter which way I choose to treat the money, I'd never end up spending it all like a fool. I've always been good with saving and making my money last, even though I've never quite handled this much.

If I take the second path, using the inheritance to take the stress off maintaining myself while working through college, I still would never deplete my investment plan below $350,000-$400,000. I calculated this after planning out yearly costs of living, medical school payments, and my residency stipends after getting through most of my schooling. So I'd still be fresh out of medical school with an investment  portfolio of almost $400,000 and no debt (which I'm unfathomably grateful for).

Still, I'm torn between being the perfect example that I want to be for my deceased loved one, and trying to help myself enjoy my early 20s with those I love in the present, as well as treating myself and helping my career develop even faster, without the stress of living on my own in school at the same time. 


TL;DR, I'm receiving a $500k inheritance soon from a loved one that mattered a lot to me, and I'm scared I won't honor them if I spend any of the money on myself or if I use it to make my time in college easier.

Any and all advice is much appreciated.",finance,1655532292

CryptoCurrency,Something interesting is happening with select altcoins,"I'm noticing (and making good use of) the fact that some altcoins seem to be exhibiting highly unusual behavior.

Bitcoin is as of writing this at around 19k.

LINK, ADA, AVAX, FTM (and more), however, have not made new lows this past week. In other words; many are going up in btc value at the time of ""highest panic"" in the market.

I'm quite happy with this because I'm balls deep in LINK myself. But I'm wondering what's going on here.

I've been here since 2013 and I haven't really seen this happen before in this way.

Could it be that with these coins fair value is being found? I don't know too much about many of them, but this narative could certainly hold for LINK for example.

Is bitcoin slowly losing (and I have to emphasize slowly here) it's dominance over crypto's with actual value?

It's like crypto's that actually have something to offer are simply less affected by btc's tantrums now. Which I welcome wholeheartedly.

I honestly have no idea. I'm just glad I'm not getting F'ed as hard as I thought I would with btc at 19k. ...Or maybe it's just a fluke and I'll be crying for my mommy tomorrow morning.

Using a top of $66k, a 82% is about $14k.
We are close, even if BTC goes to $9k, well this what DCA is for.

I would not DCA in ETH right now because of the uncertainty of ETH2.0.

Do not DCA in ALT since it is gonna dump much harder.

Sell your stable coin, the only utility of stable coin was their APY while avoiding volatility, such as a 40% drop :-). When BTC /ETH drop at 50%, thats where we started seeing the Exchange issue.

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Standard - Feasibility of Bitcoin as a reserve currency,"I’ve been reading *The Bitcoin Standard*, Saifedean Ammous’ proposal for adopting Bitcoin as the world’s reserve currency. The author likens it to gold due to its high stock-to-flow ratio and the inability of governments to control its supply and create inflation by producing additional amounts on a whim.

I’ll leave reviewing the book for a different post, except to say that it’s overall been a good read, and an engaging overview of the history of money, albeit with some kooky ideas: the author believes unsound fiat money is to blame for everything from World War II to (no joke) twerking.

I want to address the feasibility of the book’s central premise instead. According to the author, the creation of banknotes redeemable in gold is a fundamentally sound idea, and the problem with gold standard was that central banks’ takeover of the system resulted in the production of more paper money than justified by the reserves they held.

Ammous argues that Bitcoin is superior to gold in that the yearly increase in its reserves is smaller and completely predictable, and that transactions can be executed without government interference and bank intermediaries that create counterparty risk. It is a synthetically scarce asset.

For Bitcoin to be a store of value (one of the three key components of money, the other two being medium of exchange and unit of account), its price needs to stabilize. This would happen with a very high holdings-to-transactions ratio.

But a widespread adoption is essentially impossible: Bitcoin does not have a high enough transaction throughput to support the needs of a global economy. So the author proposes that the majority of transactions be executed off-chain, using banknote-like tokens, while the actual blockchain settlements are performed by central bank-like entities who issue the tokens.

Therein lies my problem with the entire concept: by removing the trustless nature of the blockchain, we are back to the exact same problem we started with: second-layer central banks are the very thing that supposedly destroyed the gold standard. Since the transactions would be off-chain, these institutions would presumably be subject to some of the same kinds of laws and regulations as banks dealing with fiat money.

If Bitcoin (or another similar cryptocurrency) were adopted globally, the world’s governments wouldn’t be able to confiscate it like gold, but they could control the banks’ behavior. And even if they couldn’t, the customers would have to trust that these digital banks wouldn’t cheat or perform rug pulls, which is something we’ve already seen happen time and time again with DeFi, and which is much easier with pseudonymity.

So what say you? Could Bitcoin ever become a global reserve currency without being subject to the same kinds of problems that destroyed the gold standard? Are second layer trust issues solvable? As of now, I remain skeptical.",cryptocurrency,1655550190
Bitcoin,Reality check,"Couple of things to clarify here. I have seen the 2017 cycle, 2019 cycle, survived the March 2020 crash to 3k and seen those glorious days of BTC over 60k not so long ago …

1) as the saying always goes “do not invest more than what you can afford to lose”. Yes, BTC is very low at this point hovering around 19k but that doesn’t guarantee that it will sky rocket again …it can go up or it can go down further. Just because there has been cycles of bear market and bull market twice in the last 5 years doesn’t mean there’s going to another super hyper bull market taking BTC to 100k or even 50k. While there is a possibility there’s no guarantee for any price. So take the risk what you can afford to lose. That’s it. Nothing more unless you wanna burn your fingers 

2) people who encourage big institutions or companies to buy more Bitcoin on Twitter or other platforms…no just no—don’t do that!! You’re essentially creating a more risky situation by asking a few whales to accumulate more of Bitcoin which is not Bitcoin was invented for! Whether it is Michael Saylor or Elon Musk or Nayib Bukele, the reality is these people can be true to their words and never sell their BTC , but not everyone surrounding them feel that way. What if tomorrow Michael Saylor is not anymore and Microstrategy is taken over by another CEO? The new CEO might not hold the same vision or perception as Michael Saylor , and if the company is forced to sell their BTC , it can create a massive spiralling downward crisis. BTC is created for us, the common people who are fed up with centralised government and authoritarian financial system. Not to be held by few whales or companies in which case it essentially becomes centralised in a way

3) Carl the moon, MM crypto, bit boy rest of the shillers who shill BTC to 100k and ask you to go long or leverage-posting massive gains at every opportunity, well folks they have all made their wealth and cashed out their principal capital amount back in the their bank account safe and sound. Let this be clear in your minds-They have all got absolutely nothing to lose anymore. Stop following their trade or tweets and actions. 

4) Moonbois and noobs and rest who are super positive-well here’s the truth. For every seller there need to be a buyer. Bitcoin won’t pump your wallet just because there’s a halving event happening every 4 years or only 21 million BTC exists creating a scarcity. There need to be enough people in the world who believe in decentralisation and feel Bitcoin is the better way of achieving decentralisation and will achieve a better stability in future rather than being highly volatile. 

5) And last but not the least, you got those people who say “I am in it purely for technology”, technology my foot, don’t do something based on those bullocks from others. While do think blockchain technology is amazing, nearly every single person who bought BTC at any price is definitely concerned about his investment. They may not talk about it or seeming not be worried in public but at the back of their mind it’s always there. No one ever buys or invests on something knowingly that they are going to lose money. Everyone wants to profit.

CryptoCurrency,A view from 2017,"Oh boy, what a bloody time to be in the market! The sky is falling! Celsius is going to  collapse!  Inflation is ramping up! The fed is raising rates! US is about to enter a recession!

All of this is true, but as someone who was down 93% on his Ethereum buys at the top (bought at $1331 at the tippy top of last bear market) and who is still currently down on said Ethereum; let it be known that we probably still have a ways to go.

Crypto hasn’t faced this kind of economy in earnest before.  Crypto hasn’t had institutions dumping to prop up their balance sheets to prep for the recession that’s coming.  Let’s not forget, crypto didn’t exist in 2008-2009 when the financial crises crashed the dow more than 50% from its all time high.  In truth, the 2010-2016 period of crypto flourished because of said crash, and had one like that happened early on, BTC might have been dead in the water.

But, right now BTC and Eth are headed to their bargain basement prices based on the market history of crypto cycles and logarithmic regression.  For those who are holding alts that are in the toilet, many will not survive this winter, and for you all, I’m sorry for this, but this is the way of crypto.  If you diversified into BTC and ETH, and perhaps a few other long term projects, you will be okay, but it’s a long slog ahead, and you’ll need to hold until mid 2024 most likely before you see any pump back up to a Bull.

People laughed at me in this sub when I said BTC will likely crash to $12000 and Eth to somewhere between $400 and $600 this cycle, and damned is that looking like the trend now.

… which is why I’m starting to DCA again.  Look, this may be the bottom, and maybe not, but if it isn’t, it’s not going to falll *that* much more.

There is still a TON of money invested in mining infrastructure, and a ton of solid projects that have a very real future ahead.  But the shakeout is here, and there has never been a better time to start really DYOR and finding projects you believe in.  Just don’t invest anything you aren’t comfortable dropping to $0.  That principle has guided me through two bulls, and it will guide me out of this bear.

Back then, interest rates were close to zero, inflation was low, and there was no risk of a coming recession. **Now, all those things have changed for the worse, but the share prices are still higher than they were back when things were sunny**.

So, either there's some good reason for this, or we are headed for further drops. Looking at the long-term graph, it seems to me that share prices should end up much lower than they are now. Maybe the bottom would be around 2900, if the market goes back to 2019-levels?

Current liquid cash:$5000

I save $800 per month which usually goes into a high yield savings account. I drained my rainy day savings($10000) to pay off CC debt in the past two months to lower my DTI ratio

Current DTI ratio is 0.27

I really want my own place since I’m tired of living with roommates, and I’m looking at 1-2 bed and 1 bath condos (I’m in Concord NH) but the housing market here is crazier than average(which is crazy as is). This is the cheapest place I can rent comfortably which is close to work ~ 5 miles away. 
Renting a 1 bed 1 bath apartment or condo sets me back by $1200 for a decent place close to work, that way I can cut back on dog sitting which costs $250 per month at the moment. Doing this will reduce the amount I can save each month though

I don’t have a lot saved up right now and I can’t afford 20% down. My credit score took a hit while moving 4 months ago but I expect it to go back to 690-700 in a few months.

My goal is to lock in a mortgage interest rate under 5.5% (under 5% is phenomenal) and get a condo for under $200,000 

Should I wait for a few years and rent or pull the trigger and buy now when interest rates are still under 6%. I expect them to hit 8% by next year at the rate they’re climbing.

personalfinance,How paychecks work with the standard deduction.,"I just started my first job and received my first paycheck, and I was surprised to find that the amount of taxes withheld was a fair bit more than I was expecting. I understand that starting a job in the middle of the year will cause taxes to be withheld for a full salary, so no confusion there. However, I thought that having filled out a W4 just last week, filing as single would automatically deduct the $12,950 for this year and reduce my tax burden paycheck to paycheck. Even completely excluding the deduction doesn’t quite add up, as the amount of federal taxes I paid is roughly equivalent to a deduction of around $3,000. I’ll put some of my salary info below for more clarification.

Salary: $65,000

Paycheck: Weekly, $1,250

Federal Taxes Withheld: $177.96, 14.24%

State Taxes Withheld: $40.38, 3.23%

Local Taxes Withheld: $18.75, 1.5%

SS Taxes Withheld: $77.50, 6.2%

MC Taxes Withheld: $18.13, 1.45%

Total Take-home Pay: $917.28

My expectation was federal taxes of around $136 with a take-home of $960ish. I also expected that my state taxes (Indiana) would be slightly lower with the deduction they provide that I checked on my form when hired.",finance,1655563947

stocks,The Fed’s Plan To Stop The Recession: Speak Loudly And Carry a Small Stick,"Jerome Powell’s plan for a “soft landing” is to speak loudly and carry a small stick 

**Speaking Loudly:**

**“The U.S. economy is in a strong position and well-positioned to deal with higher interest rates.”**

This is obviously a questionable statement. It’s one of many JPOW quotes arguing that a soft landing is possible. He claims consumer spending is unwavering, job growth is robust, unemployment will only rise to 4.1%, etc. 

So why is JPOW furiously arguing a losing position? 

**The Small Stick:**

**“Much of it is really not down to monetary policy”**

JPOW concedes, there are many factors that are out of the feds control. The Ukraine war, commodity prices, and supply issues are external factors that are unaffected by monetary policy.

Monetary policy alone will not lead to a soft landing. External factors need to also line up to bring inflation to the feds goal of 2%.  In the end, JPOW has a small stick that cannot do enough to curb inflation. 

He can’t always make pie in the sky statements about how everything will work out. Acknowledging the precarious situation ultimately gives people more confidence in him.

**The Michigan Survey**

This survey measures households expectations for inflation. Shortly after CPI numbers, the Michigan Survey showed consumers expected 5.4% annual inflation. This reflects a rise in lack of faith in the feds ability to to curb inflation. 

JPOW cited the survey as **“quite eye catching”** and **“something we need to take seriously.”** He went on to say these elevated inflation expectations were a factor in deciding a to hike rates more than he originally guided for. 

So why is JPOW holding so much weight on inflation expectations?

**Speaking Loudly = Public Confidence**

Currently the public, according to JPOW, believes the fed has the ability to bring inflation down to 2%. (He said this during his latest press conference). 

The Michigan survey showed that this public confidence in the fed is faltering. Households expecting high inflation is a sign people don’t believe in the fed. 

He states, regarding public confidence in the feds ability, **”It's absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence.”** 

Inflation expectations hold so much weight because:

 **Public confidence that a recession will not happen is key to preventing a recession.** It is not a soft landing if fighting inflation induces a recession. Public sentiment shifting towards recession expectations could be the tipping point that would prevent JPOW’s soft landing.

Sentiment is why he argues tirelessly that the consumer is strong and the economy can withstand rate hikes. He took more aggressive action against inflation to improve sentiment. **He wants to show that the fed has the tools to guide us to a soft landing even if it doesn’t.**

Markets are forward looking. It is not without merit that belief in a recession is a self fulfilling prophecy. Panic causes financial collapse more than anything else.

This is also the reason why Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she does not believe a recession will occur.

Admitting defeat is what leads to defeat. As long as you don’t accept it you can keep fighting. 

I think this shows how little the feds actual power is. They’re speaking loudly and carrying a small stick.

TLDR: JPOW aims to cancel the recession by convincing people a recession will not happen.",finance,1655567561
personalfinance,"What should I do with my $15,000 stipend?","Hey all! First time poster and genuinely wondering what I should do with a one-time $15,000 stipend I'll be receiving per the terms of my employment contract. 

I’m a new enrollee to my employer’s 401k profit sharing plan.
 
Per the terms of my employment contract, I am set to receive a $15,000 stipend on July 1st. I became officially enrolled in my employer’s 401k plan last week. From the outset of my employment (started in March) it was my intention to put the entirety of this $15,000 stipend into my 401k. However, because we are officially in a bear market, I have now decided to dollar cost average my 401k contributions between now and the end of the year. It is my intention to max out my 401k.

So that leaves me with the big question – what do I do with this $15,000 stipend?

For your reference, I have no personal debt (credit cards, auto loans, personal loans) other than student debt. My monthly net income is roughly $8000. My monthly expenses typically average around $3000. I have no money in savings. I understand the need of having a “rainy-day” fund for emergency living expenses, but this is a low priority of mine. Any excess money I’ve been making has been used to make aggressive payments on student debt principal and for investing (in art, bitcoin, Roth IRA, small “side hustles”). I am also on track to max out my HSA this year.

Per my calculations, after taxes I’ll receive roughly $10,500 of the $15k. Here are some thoughts with what I can do with this money.

1. Pay off student debt.
Since student loans are not accruing interest, every payment is a reduction of principle. My highest loan group interest rate is 7.6%. The outstanding balance of this group is $45,932. The next highest group interest rate is 7.080%, with an outstanding balance of $78,164. The total outstanding balance of my student debt is $178,610.

2. I-bonds
I-bond interest rates are at a historic high, I believe 9.62% until October. I don’t necessarily need access this $10,500 in the short-term, so putting it in an i-bond for a year or more doesn’t phase me. The lack of liquidity does give me some apprehension though, because I am not yet a homeowner and this money would be helpful for a down payment should the perfect opportunity arise.

3. Make a lump-sum investment into my 401k.
For your reference, my Roth IRA is already maxed out for this year. Even though I have decided to DCA my 401k contributions because of the current economic landscape, you may think a lump sum would be more prudent.

4. Leave it in savings
Find the highest yield savings account and put my money there.
Serves the double purpose of giving myself a cushion for emergency living expenses and also the liquidity to make a down payment on a house if the perfect opportunity comes up. Downside is that money in savings loses purchasing power every day as our country deals with historic levels of inflation.

5. Other
Choose another investment vehicle like a REIT, invest in setting up a side hustle or some other type of passive income, etc... your suggestions are welcome!

I posted my current situation for those who are curious [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/vewz6g/underwriter_for_a_mortgage_taking_a_bit_too_long/)

I got an update from my lender. Basically, with the JUMBO loan product, they do not count future anticipated rental income, so that is no longer an option.

2) Mother Cosigns loan and seek to refinance at some point in the future

I've read through 'the flowchart' multiple times and feel like I have followed it well. I would just like to see if there is anything I'm missing or other options I am not aware of.

**Info:**

* Current Mortgage is at 2.5% interest rate and my house will be rented out while I am away. Rental income will cover mortgage
* Roth IRA: Maxed each year
* 401k: Maxed each year
* HSA: Maxed each year
* 12k in HYSA
* 12k in checking account
* 10k in I-bonds
* I will need to buy a car when my assignment is over

My salary will be increasing from $100k to $135k (+\~50k/year ex-pat bonus). Housing, utilities, and transportation during my ex-pat assignment will be paid for by my company.

personalfinance,What should I do with my condo deposit going into a recession?,"What would you do in my situation? 
Earlier this year I decided to purchase my first condo. The condo was still under construction and I got a really good deal on it.  They had a target completion date of Feb but kept getting pushed back, now we’re looking at end of August. When I decided to purchase it I had about 100k in cryptos and I had several side gigs and bringing in about 20k a month. However after a series of financial mistakes I lost all my cryptos and have only about 50k in savings left and I had to cut the side jobs. After that I didnt want to close on the house anymore since the interest rates have gone up and Ill be tight on money. I tried to get find a replacement for the P&amp;S but couldnt. Now it looks like I have to decide if I want to close or just forgo the 5% deposit ~35k. 

This entire process has been extremely stressful I think I aged a couple of yrs from the last couple of months so keep in mind my mental health also has some impact on the overall decision. 

Pros of closing: i dont lose out on the deposit, I can sell for higher price down the line, building equity instead of paying rent, and no humiliation from friends who knew. 

Cons of closing: more stress, might need my parents to cosign, tight on money, pay high interest, not favorable in a recession, not too sure if my job is recession proof so if i get laid off and cant pay rent I might destroy both me and my dad’s credit. 

Pros of letting go 35k: no more stress about closing, focus on building cash during recession and focus on the post recession opportunities, no need to pay high interest, no headache to sell and find a tenant/roommate, more financial freedom to travel, more emergency fund. 

Cons: well its 35k. 

Additional facts: it took me 1.5 months to make the down payment when I had sidejobs so im okay with losing it, im looking at about 5% interest with PMI and p high taxes, ill have about 7.5 months of mortgage payments in savings account after closing. Mortgage is about 60% of my after tax monthly income. I like the condo but im also very willing to just keep renting. What would you do? 

TLDR: Should I forgo my condo down payment to get rid of all my stress and just focus on building up cash during the recession or should I go through with the condo purchase but inherit a large high interest bearing debt going into the recession?",finance,1655608183

**Note 1**

Existing Home Sales measures the change in the annualized number of existing residential buildings that were sold during the previous month. This report helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is a key indicator of overall economic strength.

A higher than expected reading should be taken as positive/bullish for the USD, while a lower than expected reading should be taken as negative/bearish for the USD.

**Note 2**

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell (Feb. 2018 – Feb. 2022) is to testify on the economic outlook and recent monetary policy actions before the Joint Economic Committee, in Washington DC. The testimony is in two parts; the first is a prepared statement, then the committee conducts a question and answer session. The Q&amp;A portion of the testimony can see heavy market volatility for the duration.

**Note 3**

Bank of England (BOE) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Member Sir Jon Cunliffe (since November 2013) is to speak. BOE MPC members are responsible for setting the benchmark interest rate and their speeches often contain indications on the future possible direction of monetary policy. 

**Note 4**

initial Jobless Claims measures the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time during the past week. This is the earliest U.S. economic data, but the market impact varies from week to week.

A higher than expected reading should be taken as negative/bearish for the USD, while a lower than expected reading should be taken as positive/bullish for the USD.

**Note 5**

The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Crude Oil Inventories measures the weekly change in the number of barrels of commercial crude oil held by US firms. The level of inventories influences the price of petroleum products, which can have an impact on inflation.  
 If the increase in crude inventories is more than expected, it implies weaker demand and is bearish for crude prices. The same can be said if a decline in inventories is less than expected.  
 If the increase in crude is less than expected, it implies greater demand and is bullish for crude prices. The same can be said if a decline in inventories is more than expected.

**Note 6**

Results of the bank stress test will be released for 34 of the largest US banks. Details will include which banks passed, which failed, estimates for new capital requirements and whether each financial institution will be able to increase dividends and continue share buybacks.

New Home Sales measures the annualized number of new single-family homes that were sold during the previous month. This report tends to have more impact when it's released ahead of Existing Home Sales because the reports are tightly correlated.

personalfinance,"First Mortgage, am I making a horrible mistake?","This is sort of a long post but I have no idea how to approach a mortgage or how much I can afford. I grew up pretty poor- family was intermittently on food stamps, my parents couldn't afford their first house until well into their 40s/50s. They have next to no financial literacy and haven't been much of a resource for me. They worked hard though and got me great educational opportunities and I'm in a position now where I can finally start making some progress independently to set up my future.   


I'm actually in a very good spot right now- I had to take out a lot of student loans but have recently inherited some money and can afford to pay most of it off. However, I have also been renting for the past 10+ years and I think its finally time to buy a house as well. I was promoted at work a few years ago and make a pretty good income now. The problem is, I don't know the first thing about how to plan my next steps. My student loans have high interests rates, so my plan was to pay those off first. I would have to use most of my savings to pay the down payment of any mortgage, which would delay paying off student loans. Or, I could take a bit more risk and have a lower down payment for a mortgage and save enough to pay off my loans. I'm really not sure which route to go.  


Currently, I have around 180k in student loans. Interest is about 6.8-7% on those loans, all federal, all deferred. I had been making regular payments until the forbearance began and instead used that time to build my savings. I also inherited some money recently so I have just about 200k in savings right now. In my area, most houses are still going for 300-400k. My fiancée and I combined make pretty good income (180k now) and so I think that's within our budget. We're finally looking to buy a house together to stay in for the next 5-10 years (not our forever home, but at the very least to build some equity).

Currently, this is what has been offered to us:   
\- mortgage 1: 30 years, 10% down, 4.375% interest, for a loan total of 414000 out of a 460k house. The first 15 years are fixed, the next has a 6 mo ARM.

\- mortgage 2: 0% down, 5% interest, for a loan total of 460k. Again, 15 year fixed, then 6 mo ARM thereafter for total of 30 years.

\- mortgage 3: 10% down, 4.8% fixed 30 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I figure I should not wipe out my savings entirely for this purchase, so between the down payment of the loan (46,000) and paying a bulk payment on the student loans, I can afford to spend around  150k. That can get my student loans down to about 84k which I can pay off over the next few years. OR I could take the 0% interest loan and pay off all but about 34k of the student loans but probably pay more in the long term on interest on the house. Finally, I could just wipe out my savings and pay off the student loans entirely and take that risk (I would rather not do that as it seems unnecessarily risky, with the economy in such shambles lately).   


Both my fiancée and I are fairly confident in our job security. Thing is, we would like to move to a bigger city eventually so our plan is to pay the house off asap (hopefully 15-20 years). I think it might be possible to pay it off early, or sell the house if the market is right. But I'm feeling overwhelmed right now as I've never had to make these types of decisions before and my family has no idea where to start. I realize I should probably get a financial advisor but I also don't know where/how to start that process either, or how to find someone I trust.

Most of you joined this subreddit during the bullrun hype of 2021, as evidenced by the fact that we had less than 2 million users pre-2021, now it's 5 million. 

While it's easy to isolate Bitcoin and rest of crypto as a failure during these times of uncertain geopolitical and economical climate. You should understand that ""Everything"" is going down. 

You can thank the federal reserve for this. They avoided short term pain by injecting money into the economy for a long time and now wants to revert that change by raising interest rates and crashing the party. 

Basically, they act like Gods. One flick of a switch and we all question our sanity. 

But even Gods are now facing the dilemma of crashing the economy or letting inflation go wild. It's funny that whatever they decide on, we're all screwed.

Bitcoin was meant to become a parallel economy that avoids this level of control by the FED and let the masses decide instead. However, this thesis hasn't come true as we still consider BTC as a speculative asset. Most consider it a Ponzi. A get rich quick scheme. 

But when fiat becomes unsustainable in the future, which I assure you it isn't. You will be happy that you had a stake in an alternative. 

Right now, the best thing you can do is to gather as much data as possible. Make your own investment thesis. And ride this shitstorm.

The FED will pump liquidity again soon. This boom and bust cycle will repeat. That's the only way the fiat system works.

My mother has put all the money in our home country's bank where it returns between 10-15% a year and we used to live off that.

It has been sustainable for the past few years, but unfortunately due to the current world's economic crisis, our home country's currency is collapsing.

Whether it is through research, advice or part time work. I am planning on getting scholarships as my grades in school were very high, and to also work part-time and to participate in the co-op program for engineering in order to mitigate my expenses.

Some ideas I brainstormed were to invest a partial amount of money into the US S&amp;P 500 through a broker called interactive brokers ( I have heard they are reputable). There was also the option of investing into the Canadian real estate market, and renting properties out. But I am afraid that there might be a housing bubble pop. Another option was to convert all the money into USD, and live off it until when things are better economically, and put the money back into the annual home country's interest rate. The last option is what we are currently doing, and we are yet to decide about the rest.

I have suggested hiring a financial advisor, but my parents are adamant that there is nothing they can suggest that we already do not know, and how they might scam us.

personalfinance,Rate Lock Risk. Need Advice.,"Happy Sunday folks. I am now the one in need of advice from the smart folks here that know more than i. 

Here is the situation. 

We contracted to build a new home in October of 2021. Construction started in January 2022. I do follow the markets a good bit and knew that with increasing inflation, the fed would raise rates so, in February of 2022, I locked in a 30-year fixed rate of 3.625 with an 11-month rate lock. This includes the ability to extend the rate lock up to 60 days for a fee of $1000. At the time our construction supervisor had indicated the projected completion of August-October of 2022. Plenty of time right. Well, then came the HVAC delays which have our house sitting for the last few months with no progress and they are now not committal on the completion date. 

Per the contract, they have up to 24 months. It was a calculated risk at the time.

As a plan B, I reached out to the lender to determine other options which would keep the payment in the same general ballpark. 

Of note, we plan to stay in this home for 10 years. 

* Financing Option               Monthly Payment
* Fixed 3.625%	                 $4,486.00 26% of Gross Income
* 3 Year ARM - 4.5%	         $4,836.00

* 7 Year ARM - 5% 	         $5,044.90 
* 10 YearARM  - 5.375	 $5,204.00 

Given the position I am in and your thoughts on where rates may go in the outer years, what option would you recommend? Note, I have always had 30-year fixed loans. I have no experience with ARM.

I usually pay more than the monthly payment to shorten my loan down but now that I have some extra cash, would it make sense to start dumping money into these debts rather than putting it into savings?

ethereum,Comparison of liquidity distribution between Uniswap V3 and curve V2,"In the last article, we theoretically deduced why the slippage of uniswap V3 is smaller than that of curve, but another question that what is the actual liquidity distribution of the two protocal? When adding liquidity to uniswap, we can see the following liquidity distribution diagram.

What would the liquidity distribution of the curve V2 look like? We know that the liquidity of curve V2 is mainly concentrated near the price equilibrium point in order to reduce the slippage , but meanwhile to ensure unlimited liquidity, the liquidity distribution of curve V2 have to show a sharp normal distribution graph as shown in the figure below. However, the liquidity distribution of uniswap V3 is relatively flat ranging from -50% to 150% of the current price, as a result uniswap V3 can provide low slippage in a large price range, while curve V 2 only shows low slippage in a very narrow range of±5% of the current price, once beyond the peak range, the slippage increases dramatically.

cybersecurity,My first cybersecurity internship and what I'm doing. Are any newcomers doing things similar?,"I wanted to share my story about getting my first cybersecurity internship and explain what they have me doing for my fellow cyber students out there.

\*\*This is my experience and will not reflect every hiring situation\*\*

I found this internship through LinkedIn and applied right from the LinkedIn website. The position was for ""Technical Intern"" at a defense contractor. I had only one interview via conference call with their ""Sr. Engineering Manager"" and a ""Systems Security Engineer III"". They really only wanted to gauge my experience level (which was absolutely none), and to make sure I could converse with them professionally.

They asked me a lot of questions in the form of: ""Describe a time when . . . and how did you . . .?"" Like for example the question: ""Describe a time when you had to work in a group setting and how did you interact with your group-mates?"" And some follow-up questions with that.

I applied as a junior in college with no experience in a professional setting, prior to this, and no certifications. I also have had zero technical experience. They really took into account that I'm still a student; I just tried to show them my passion for this field and my willingness to learn new things.

Right now, they have me reviewing their policies &amp; procedures to complete the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC). Basically going through CMMC documentation referencing NIST SP 800-171 ([https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/documentation.html](https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/documentation.html)) and ensuring all those controls are implemented in our environment.

An example is: AC.L2-3.1.5 (Least Privilege) control says we have to have ""\[a\], \[b\], \[c\], and \[d\]"" implemented. I cross-reference our documentation to ensure we have policy that reflects a, b, c, and d.

I also help out in system vulnerability scans and get to watch their vulnerability-patch process (which is super cool).

Since we handle Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), it's imperative we reach and maintain level 3 of v2 CMMC (basically proving we can safely store, transmit, protect FCI &amp; CUI); this is why I am so happy with what I am working with, even if it's just paperwork.

By the time I graduate, I've had multiple coworkers recommend me pursue a certification (like CompTIA's Security+) and to continue researching programming languages to get comfortable.

For anyone else trying to get an internship, keep looking, try to enjoy the journey, and above all, trust the process!

Edit: Added CUI and version # to CMMC paragraph for clarification.",technology,1655648611

REITS were clearly the stable play because they had steady cash flows and strong balance sheets. Now REITS are in hot water again because the broad market is selling off, there are fears of a recession, and interest rates are going up meaning people can find a safer return elsewhere.

I am of some belief that interest rates and inflation will taper sooner than later. The higher yields on bond funds is enticing. As interest rates decrease, depending on the durations of the funds, I may have capital gains increases along with the yield. 

Now, if interest rates keep climbing, and nothing says they can not, as we saw in the late 1970's, bond funds would lose a lot more than possible time frames and subsequent inflation gains, etc.  would output.

I was always taught to treat a car like a liability and not an asset, but with borrowing rates so low, inflation so high, and chip shortages causing a supply shortage, should we consider buying a more expensive car assuming the value may actually go up over time?

Also, with the electric vehicle tax credit, I could potentially get $10K off my taxes this year.

Example: Instead of buying a $15K used Jeep Wrangler, buy a $60K all electric Volvo with a $10K tax credit, basically getting the car at $50K and potentially being able to sell it for more than $50K in a few years.

My wife and I both have relatively secure high paying jobs, but never seen the value in buying an expensive luxury car (we currently share a 2017 Honda CRV).

If you own a deflationary asset that will increase in value over time why do people want their money to grow? I feel like this will stagnate the use of crypto as a currency and more as a bond/CD over time. Fast flowing market place = more users. And how could you ""trust"" someone to hold your BTC, ETH, LTC, etc for lending purposes? Isn't this one obvious? Not your keys not your coins?

In all honesty it is really hard job to make money with money.  To expect such high yield returns for lending money you cant even get back should be a red flag for a dangerous investment. Where the high apy is the bait to lure people into such dangerous schemes.

I personally think that PoW is the only concensus mechanism that currently has any ground. Seeing how Solano is being manipulated by the devs to prevent a single user from liquidating should be a sell signal for all PoS coins. When I think about ETH, it just seems like it is slowly becoming more and more similar to the USD.

Feds print and spend money in their own market place that they created. Feds could print money to buy crypto and ruin PoS voting (Extreme example). PoS will remove the power from the users and into the hands of big bag holders. The big bag holders won't be voting for everyone's best interest.

personalfinance,ELI5: How does mortgage deduction work?,"Hello r/personalfinance

I'm contemplating moving to California (from abroad) and obviously the biggest issue I can see is housing prices - trying to do the math here but it's tricky for a foreigner given all your states have different rules. I [heard](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/housing) that interest on mortgage is tax deductible - but how exactly does this work? It seems at least for wiki writers it's obvious what ""deductible"" means so I figured I'll ask.

My current take is:

1. I find a real estate on zillow.com  , say I found a house for $1m, $200k downpayment needed, $800k mortgage. Interest rate 5% so that's $40k interest in the first year
2. I then go to [https://smartasset.com/taxes/paycheck-calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/paycheck-calculator) and put in salary, say $200k annually, married, that adds up to $60 257 in annual taxes after calculator did it's job on correct zip code
3. I then check the same for $160k (income minus interest) - $44 075 of taxes
4. So the difference in tax comes back as $16k - that's $1 333 a month so it's actually quite substantial as it brings down the ""net"" cost of mortgage from insane $5826 to a bit more manageable $4500 

Did I miss anything? I mean not the exact numbers or rates, I can and will find them before any move, I'm just wondering if that methodology is correct - are there any limits of deduction I'm not aware of? Perhaps it doesn't work like I think it does at all? Or i.e. applies only to federal tax but not state tax, etc.?",finance,1655660455
Forex,A Lesson on Fundamentals...,"I've seen various questions and statements recently regarding interest rates, QE/QT, inflation and it seems there's a lot of confusion and misinformed people out there so I want to share some correct information. If there are any additional points or questions I can edit the post to be more comprehensive too. So let's start:

#  - Inflation: -

Inflation is a key topic of discussion among people here, some who say QE is responsible, some say government spending too much money during the pandemic and some say otherwise. Let's first start with what inflation is: an increase in the cost of goods &amp; services over time. The list of reasons for why that happens is long but it's generally agreed upon the following causes:

1. **Cost-Push Inflation:**   
When a business produces a good or service, they have input costs along with a profit margin that factor into the price of that product. This point is really key to what we're seeing right now because many inputs such as oil, commodities &amp; the cost of labor are a really high cost right now. In order for a business to maintain margins &amp; profitability, they must increase the cost of their produce.
2. **Demand-Pull Inflation:**  
When there is excess demand over supply in the economy which is rarer than the example above but the pandemic was a good example, you have rising prices. Various examples of this from the graphics card shortage to the used vehicle boom when semiconductor production was low. Consumers bid up the cost of these items and/or businesses raise prices to increase profits which is what they're always trying to do maximum level they can get away with without reducing sales.
3. **Government Fiscal Policy:**  
Governments have the ability to fiscally support or slow down the economy using various policies whether that be spending or taxation to name a few and hence why government spending is included in GDP. The stimulus checks were a great example of adding consumer demand and investment to the economy to support it. This will produce inflation in the form of 1 and/or 2 described above.
4. **Borrowing:**  
When interest rates are low, there is more incentive for consumers &amp; businesses to borrow money from banks or other lenders which once again produces the effect of 1 and/or 2 above. 

It's important to note that inflation is a self-fulfilling prophecy in line with expansion and contraction of the economy. It's impossible to keep inflation at 0% when the economy is growing therefore a certain level of inflation is necessary. It's also impossible to keep inflation at it's current rate when the economy is undergoing a contraction. If we take the contraction as an example, inflation will come lower as less is being spent across the economy. This results in production being cut which results in less inputs being bought in the form of commodities or labor for example and this results in even lower levels of income which means less being spent over time... you get the picture. This is key now joining the dots as to why a recession is being forecasted so long as the Fed's target remains to lower inflation. The economy is not a maze, it's a gearbox as such.

# - Interest Rates -

Perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of the economy is monetary policy, which both tools like QE and policies like interest rates fall under the umbrella term, so let's start with interest rates. There are various rates of interest across the economy that affect it's performance, from yields on government/corporate bonds to the federal funds rate that we're all familiar with. This topic will be long so bear with me as I hope to put it in some kind of order.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Interest Rates:**  
There are various interest rates in the economy depending on the product. An interest rate is simply the rate of return for a lender in order to loan money to another entity. The rate of return is determined by many factors such as the amount or length of the loan along with the riskiness of the loan depending on the borrower's financial position and other complexities that aren't the subject of this post today. Since the safest asset on the planet is U.S. treasuries, the minimum interest rate in the economy depending on the horizon will be determined by the yield offered on the treasury depending on the timescale. An example of this would be why would a bank loan money to a business at 1% interest rate annually over a 5 year period if a 5 year treasury is offering 1% every 6 months? Therefore banks will have to charge higher rates of interest and businesses can expect to pay more in order for borrowing to take place. Now you can see why controlling the bond market and interest rates is key to controlling lending in the economy. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **What is the Fed Funds Rate &amp; What is the Impact?**  
The federal funds rate is the rate that is referred to when we hear of them raising rates. This rate is simply the level of interest that the Fed influences for banks to borrow from each other. Since banks have to meet a certain reserve requirement overnight, it can easily fall above or below that level during day-to-day operations, so in order to meet these requirements, banks must borrow from each other. If the Fed targets these interest rates lower, banks are more likely to loan money &amp; invest in assets since banks need to use as much of their reserves as they can without falling below the reserve requirement in order to generate returns. Money sitting idle is devaluing &amp; also not accepted by CBs as a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) which banks need to hold for the liquid coverage ratio, but that's a topic for another day. This is another reason why the Fed targets a certain level of inflation, it means money keeps moving. If banks cannot borrow or lend to each other for whatever reason, they can borrow from the Fed which is also known as the discount window, but they need to exhaust all options before doing that.  

* **How is the Fed Funds Rate Set?**  
The Fed funds rate is not just a rate set by the Fed and that's it. It's a freely traded market among banks and the Fed funds rate is just a measure of this level of interest. The Fed conducts open market operations in order to influence this rate by instructing the trading desk at the New York Fed to either buy or sell treasuries among other securities, to influence the reserve balances of the banks. This helps them keep the funds rate in an effective window that they target. By targeting an interest rate range, it can set a level of lending in the economy to help the Fed achieve it's mandate set by congress of price stability and maximum employment.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Bond Market:**  
The bond market needs a lot of explanation so bear with me. Firstly it's important to note that there is a primary and secondary bond market. The primary bond market is where entities trade newly issued bonds at auction and this is how the government gets funded. People have a wild misconception that the Fed prints money and that's how the government can run deficits... not true, the government is funded with actual money. The treasuries are bid on by these private entities whether it's institutions or funds of various kinds and the yield they bid on is typically equal to or higher than inflation expectations over the bond's time span. The coupon rate is paid every 6 months so if inflation is expected to be 2% over 10 years, the yield of the bond will be at least 1%.   
Now, this isn't the same as the bonds we see traded on the secondary market. The secondary market is where these bonds go to trade based on their value over time. If the market expects inflation and interest rates to rise by several percent, the value of the bonds with lower coupon rates will drop and therefore the effective yield offered rises to equal to or more than a newly issued bond offers. That's what you're seeing when the headlines say ""US 10 Year yield rises to above 3%"" This means the asking price of traders with a 10 year treasury that's paying lower than the expected rate in months to come are selling them cheaper and cheaper. The opposite is true when rates and inflation drop, the treasuries with higher coupon rates/yield become a lot more valuable because the payout they offer is higher than what anyone can or can expect to buy them at in time.  
I had to explain this because people need to understand that while the price of bonds are falling/yields rising, this doesn't mean that treasuries are not in demand... in fact they could be at a much higher demand now than they were 6 months ago even if the price is falling and as a result the dollar is stronger due to an influx of investors looking for a safe haven asset in U.S. denominated debt.

Hopefully this clears up what interest rates are, how they're set, they're impact, the bond market's relationship to them and ultimately the relationship between interest rates and inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

# - QE/QT -

QE/QT is the source of most misinformation I've seen from people saying QE is responsible for inflation to money being printed out of thin air and so on. It's important to correct this so let's first start with QE.   


* QE or Quantitative Easing is a tool of monetary policy the Fed began to implement when interest rates are at or near the Zero Lower Bound. QE is where the Fed buys bonds from a commercial bank in exchange for bank reserves. Since banks do not and were never constrained by bank reserves when it comes to lending, none of these reserves ever enter the real economy, they all stay at the central bank. So QE does not and never has spurred inflation (directly).

&amp;#x200B;

* Since regulation post 2008, it forces banks to maintain what's called a Liquidity Coverage Ratio where they must own at least 100% or more of HQLA's (High quality liquid assets) compared to the net cash outflow over 30 days. HQLA's consist of coins/bank notes (physical), bank reserves at the Fed &amp; Domestic sovereign debt (treasuries. Banks are also permitted to own assets that aren't fully a HQLA but make up 40% or 15% of that number. So for example, a bank could own corporate debt with at least an AA- rating that makes up 40% of a HQLA, in order to be valued the same as bank reserves or treasuries they must own at least 2.5x more of them, so 2.5bn corporate debt is equal to 1bn of treasuries. 15% of a HQLA are qualifying equities (obviously can't be penny stocks) and BBB- or higher rated corporate debt. In order to qualify as a full HQLA a bank must own say 6.5 billion of a certain equity compared to 1 billion of cash.

&amp;#x200B;

* Finally, while bank reserves qualify as a HQLA, cash is negative yielding due to inflation, exchange rates &amp; aren't a good interest hedging asset so QE places a large burden on banks to carry out what's called a portfolio rebalancing effect. Primarily treasuries will begin being bought up again by banks on the secondary market followed by corporate bonds and all this begins to drive yields lower and credit markets become more liquid and banks can even use reserves with other banks to buy equities and various other assets. Now you can quickly see why QE has the effect of creating a bubble in assets like housing, corporate debt and equities to a smaller degree.

&amp;#x200B;

* QT doesn't have the same symmetrical impact on banking as QE does. The Fed simply lets assets it holds on the balance sheet ""mature"" and they essentially burn the digital cash out of existence. In order to keep the balance sheet constant, they would have been replacing these matured assets with new ones even though QE might not have been implemented, they were still buying at a steady rate. When QT happens, the amount of buying by the Fed is gone at an incremental pace. The decline in asset prices we're seeing is not down to QT, maybe a little bit but mostly higher interest rates means the bubbles in riskier assets like corporate and equities will deflate while buying of more interest rate hedged assets increases.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this finally explains a lot of confusion and misinformation that's out there about monetary policy and money printing etc... as this relates to Forex and what's happening to currencies on a fundamental level I can explain in a new post or I can answer questions below. I hope this is received well as I'm sure people are married to a lot of false ideas like the infamous ""helicopter money"" explanation coined by Friedman and so on, but the information above is are the facts whether you want to cross reference with government websites, peer-reviewed studies and so on.",finance,1655660633

I will lay down bearish arguments followed by bullish arguments. I will then try to extrapolate some conclusions that will help better plan our investment strategies from now on.

# Bearish case—Reasons why there’s still some pain ahead

Crypto bear markets usually take a year to reach the cycle bottom and consolidate from there. This cycle peak happened in November, which means that some downside volatility could still occur. Furthermore, massive rallies are historically triggered before the halving, which won’t happen before April 2024.

**The macroeconomic environment is still uncertain**

Everyone following the crypto market knows that it is highly correlated with the stock market, which isn’t looking great right now. The major indexes are in a bear market, the war in Ukraine, the economic sanctions against Russia and the supply chain bottlenecks can still bring up the price of commodities such as oil, gas, wheat, soybeans, etc., forcing central banks to continue their hawkish stance by raising interest rates, which will inevitably be bad for global markets as well as crypto.

**Bitcoin dominance is still low**

In the 2018 bear market, Bitcoin dominance plummeted during the first few months of the collapse but hovered around 60% during the December 2018 cycle bottom only to further increase as the accumulation phase went on. Today, Bitcoin dominance sits at around 44% and some altcoins still outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum. Furthermore, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu still rank respectively 10th and 16th by market cap. This shows that maximum capitulation likely hasn’t been reached yet as some people still invest in meme coins hoping for quick gains.

**We might see other crypto black swan events**

The collapse of Terra Luna and Celsius might just only be the beginning as some crypto-related projects struggle to find some liquidity and investors are leaving the crypto space, further pushing crypto asset prices to the downside.

# Bullish case—Reasons why we’re at the bottom

**Technical buy signals are flashing**

The weekly MACD is at an all-time low. Usually, when the weekly MACD is at such a low level, it’s a great opportunity to buy. Also, the monthly MACD is also at an all-time low. Furthermore, a lot of Bitcoin models are flashing strong buy signals. For example, the rainbow chart is at the “basically a fire sale” level. Historically, buying Bitcoin at these levels has led to massive profits in the long run.

**Fear is high**

Even though I said earlier that Bitcoin dominance is still low and some meme coins still rank a bit too high for my comfort, there’s no denial that the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency space is massively bearish. The fear and greed index is as low as it has ever been and even the most obnoxious moonboy influencers now all agree that we’re in a crypto winter.

**Inflation might be reaching its peak soon**

It might be too early to make this claim and I’m fully aware that it can age like milk, but I think it’s not too far-fetched to consider the possibility that the macroeconomic situation might be cooling off a little, at least in the short term. China has eased its lockdowns, Putin has concentrated his war effort to the Donbas region, and commodities such as oil, gas and corn are currently below their ATH and might be further decreasing in the next weeks.

# OK, so what should I do from now?

In order to plan your strategy from now, it is important to look at what we know during these uncertain times. Even though every bear market/crypto winter is different, I think it’s a good idea to look at what we know in the crypto space and in the broader markets:

· The macroeconomic situation is still in a bear market and highly uncertain, which mean that we will see a lot of volatility in the upcoming month. Relief rallies and more downside pain are to be expected.

· Strong technical buy signals are flashing in the crypto space if you are a long-term investor.

· Cryptocurrencies are high-risk assets who typically don’t perform well in a risk-off environment. They also don’t perform well when the stock market is in a downtrend.

· Crypto winters last a long time; we are very unlikely to reach new ATH in the short term. History has shown that further downward momentum can be expected in the coming months before reaching a consolidation period.

· Historically, BTC dominance tends to increase during bear markets and skyrockets during the beginning of the new bull market, before the halving.

· Timing the exact bottom of a bear market is a very, very hard feat to do.

Here are strategies based on four different investor profiles.

*“I’m hodling no matter what. I have diamond hands and crypto is only a small fraction of my portfolio.”*

History has shown that hodling through bear markets is one of the best long-term strategies. If you think you can handle further downward momentum without flinching, then keep hodling. Your diamond hands will surely reward you in the next few years if you own Bitcoin, Ethereum or other altcoins with strong fundamentals.

*“I’m still hodling, but I’m deeply in the red and starting to panic. I wasn’t expecting the crypto market to go that low!”*

In that case, you might want to review your strategy in order for you *not* to panic sell at a loss in the future. Considering that Bitcoin tends to perform better than altcoins during bear markets, it might be wise to trade some alts to Bitcoin, especially since BTC dominance is still low at the moment. Also, if you have invested more than you could afford to lose, you might want to rethink your strategy before the next bull market. Planning a short-term exit strategy during the next relief rally in order to mitigate your risks might be wise.

*“I’ve panic sold/my stop loss was triggered. Now what?”*

In that scenario, I think the worst thing to possibly do is to panic buy at a higher price during the next short-term relief rally, which is likely to happen if we consider the very low RSI. Bear market rallies and dead-cat bounces are likely in the current environment. Remember the broader picture: crypto winters can last multiple years and Bitcoin’s next halving is in April 2024. There will be plenty of buy-back opportunities. A lot of strategists are saying that being cash heavy is a good thing in the current environment, so use that to your advantage. DCAing back into Bitcoin during the next year-year and a half might be a wise strategy, while keeping an eye open to invest a little bit more during bigger dips. Personally, I would focus on Bitcoin in the beginning, as it historically outperforms altcoins until after the next bull-market rally.

*“I’m new to the crypto space and I’m looking for great projects to invest in.”*

Despite the overall negative sentiment, bear markets are a great time to start dabbling into crypto, considering most people tend to enter crypto late during the bull market. DCAing in Bitcoin right now is a good strategy, while researching for some good altcoin projects to invest in when the macroeconomic environment is more favorable. Remember to invest only what you can afford to lose and be ready for some volatility.

defi,4 ways to make money during the crypto crash in June 2022,"Nobody likes bear markets. They are depressive-like the darkness everyone fears. But today, let's bring light into the dark. Because every market phase has opportunities — you just have to find them.

**Crypto Staking-Deposits**

Simply put, staking describes the process of locking your tokens at a platform to receive interest. Usually, platforms offer the possibility for flexible staking (withdraw at any time) and fixed staking (e.g., locking your assets for one month or longer).

You can stake your tokens on platforms, such as Binance, [Crypto.com](https://midas.investments/), [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/), or Kucoin. On top of that, you can find tons of decentralized platforms, such as Beefy Finance and many DEX such as Pancake Swap.

How much can you make with staking?

How much you can make with staking depends on several factors — the token you stake and the lock-up period. For example, Staking Tether (USDT) on a flexible basis won’t make you rich and will result in probably a 13.5% APR (on the Midas platform). Conversely, if you hold some more volatile coins and stake them for a couple of months, more than 100% APRs are easily possible.

**Yield farming**

Yield farming, also known as liquidity mining, is a passive way of generating earnings by contributing to liquidity pools. Simply put, it is the process of getting rewarded with tokens or fees for locking up your cryptocurrency.

If you search the web, you can find many yield farming platforms, such as Beefy Finance, Autofarm, or Single Finance.

How much can you make with yield farming?

Again, this depends on the liquidity you provide. If you go for a single common asset, you might earn some single-digit returns annually. However, there’s almost no limit to the upside.

**Crypto Lending**

Crypto lending is what the name already says: For a defined period, you lend your available assets to someone else. For the time of lending, you receive a specified interest rate. Lending is available on many common CEX and some decentralized platforms.

How much can you make with crypto lending?

From what I’ve seen, the return is lower compared to staking and yield farming. Nevertheless, the market is quite volatile, and you can achieve some juicy returns when demand is high.

**Automated Grid Trading Bots**

Grid trading bots profit from the ups and downs of the market. You set a price range for the bot, adjust how many grids you want, and as long as the price stays within your set range, the bot will always sell a portion when the price goes a bit up and buy a portion when it goes a bit down. A grid bot works best on a fluctuated sideways market. However, some platforms also offer dedicated bear market bots. According to the reviews, Kucoin and Pionex bots show good results.

How much can you make with grid bots?

Again it is not easy to answer and depends on many factors: Chosen coin, market development, or volatility. However, with the right conditions, achieving 1% returns daily is possible quite often.",cryptocurrency,1655668633

personalfinance,Need advice for what to do about student loans,"Not sure how to go about finances. 27F

Law professional. Salary is $225k, student loan debt $240k (not paying right now because of the federal freeze).

The federal freeze has allowed me to really save up over the last year or so. I’ve managed to save upwards of $52k (parked in a HYS account), have $26k invested in a Schwab account, and another $15k in my 401k (I just started working in 2020). My employer does not match. Also have some crypto (but the market is not doing so hot). 

If the freeze doesn’t continue, should I make a lump sum payment to my loans (before the payments start back up) to take advantage of the 0% interest or keep saving for a house? If my payments start back up, I’m going to have to pay roughly $2700 a month, which makes me want to pause the breaks on my house goals for a while so I can think more about re-financing with a private lender for a lower payment. Current federal loan plan will forgive my loans in 20 years (which will make for a HUGE tax bomb). Salary goes up 5% every year. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Before I get to trucks, let me give a quick update on other trends. First, [inventories are piling up in retail](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/35192-us-retailers-plan-big-discounts-as-inflation-inventory-add-up), with for example ""a 32% jump in inventories during the first quarter"" in Walmart.

&gt; A gauge of supply chain pressure in the U.S. economy fell to the lowest level since December 2020, as activity such as trucking cools from elevated levels with few signs yet of a worrying collapse.
&gt; 
&gt; The Logistics Managers Index dropped to 67.1 in May, the second straight decline from a record of 76.2 reached in March. Faster gains in warehouse and inventory costs offset slower moves in transport prices. 

Third, [diesel future dropped at the end of last week](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/big-diesel-futures-drop-to-end-the-week), partly on news of Russia's oil production recovering slightly.
&gt; 
&gt; The most significant bearish news in the market came out of Russia, where news reports said Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters that by finding alternate buyers to the Western countries and companies that have shunned Russian oil, the country’s output was close to the 10.2 million barrels per day level from February, prior to the invasion of Ukraine.

Fourth, US ports seem to be peaking earlier than usual, indicating a slowdown may come earlier than later. [Article](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/35187-top-us-port-enlists-white-house-help-to-clear-rail-cargo-logjam).

From the same website, here is the cost of shipping from Shanghai: [Graph](https://i.imgur.com/2WCTxY3.png).

Now to the main article on used truck prices. While reading this, recall that used car prices were one of the main contributors to inflation back in Spring 2021. Article [(Freight Waves)](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/used-truck-auction-prices-falling-fast):

&gt; Auction prices of used trucks are falling almost as quickly as they rose over the last year. That is leaving owner-operators stuck with overpriced equipment they thought they could pay for in a hot spot freight market that is cooling off. 
&gt; 
&gt; “The market is primarily absorbing trucks from fleets no longer retaining all of their older iron as new trucks trickle in and, to an extent, from owner-operators leaving the industry or going to work for a fleet,” said Chris Visser, senior analyst and commercial vehicles product manager for J.D. Power Valuation Services.
&gt; 
&gt; In its latest Guidelines report, **Power said auction prices in May for model year 2020 used trucks fell 11% from April. Prices for model year 2019 trucks fell 15.9% month over month and 2018 models dropped 9.9%.** 
&gt; 
&gt; “In May, 3- to 5-year-old trucks averaged 12.0% less money than April, but 57.5% more money than May 2021,” Visser said. “Year over year, late-model trucks sold in the first five months of 2022 averaged 82.6% more money than the same period of 2021.”

&gt; **Getting stuck by high used truck auction prices**
&gt; 
&gt; When spot rates were paying $4 a mile and more, no price was too high for a fleet to add capacity. The idea was to take advantage of record-high rates and not worry about the equipment price premium. Now owner-operators who overpaid for equipment stand to get burned.
&gt; 
&gt; “Trucking economy data shows rising terminations of owner-operator authorities and a steady and notable decline in spot rates from February through May,” Visser said. “Taken alone, those two items could suggest the new owner-operators who entered the industry in 2020-2021 are now exiting the industry.”
&gt; 
&gt; Overall truck transportation employment increased through the spring. May was the highest month in recorded history for the sector. That suggests new owner-operators could be going to work for fleets.

&gt;**Retail prices still elevated**
&gt; 
&gt; Retail prices in dealerships are still near record highs. Pricing moves tend to trail auction auctions. As rates fall, so will truck demand and prices, according to Steve Tam, vice president of ACT Research.
&gt; 
&gt; “Unfortunately, long-awaited reports of loosening inventories come at exactly the wrong time in the cycle,” he said. “This is the beginning of the end of the cycle, which promises to be every bit as exciting on the way down as it was on the way up.”
&gt; 
&gt; Just as auction and retail prices vary, the freight market consists of contracted and spot-rate pricing.
&gt; 
&gt; “If your customers are mainly small fleets and owner-operators who operate in the spot market, you’re hearing the sky is falling,” Visser said. “If your customers are mainly larger fleets who operate in the contract market, you’re hearing conditions are still strong
&gt; 
&gt;

**Implication for Equities**

If supply chain improvements alone improve inflation, the Fed can ease on their tightening and stocks will do relatively well. If demand reduction is what is driving improvements, this implies a recession and a possible worse bear market (or not, who knows). Both together? This may suggest that there will be a stock market in 2023. There may even be a market. Higher bond yields on US government bonds (caused by the Fed) mean that you can earn a higher premium for taking no risk at all. This means if you want to hold a riskier asset like a stock, you would demand an even higher premium. This causes stock prices to fall until the premium of buying it at that price is sufficiently high relative to bond yields.

EDITS:

1. The article is about freight trucking, not your regular consumer pick-up trucks.
2. It is impossible to draw obvious conclusions about the stock market from this. My low confidence response is that this is bullish for equities (if it slows down Fed hikes), maybe not the economy.
3. This is not an original thesis.
4. I am aware that inflation is more than just used truck prices. The intent of this post was to get a snapshot of some of the key industries in the US supply chain. I hope that is helpful.",finance,1655673256

**Base salary:** 86k (22% Fed Tax for now, no income tax for my state; 24% begins at 89k, which I expect to reach within a year)

**401k (Fidelity):** Total pre-tax contribution is 8% for employer match (Employer matches 75% upto 8%) + 2% into S&amp;P 500 (offered by Fidelity, unsure if its their ETF or not). I would contribute more but unsure if this is the smartest approach. Very interested in index investing.

Important note: I do have some previous employer 401k accounts floating around out there. But I didn't focus much on retirement so I don't expect this to be game changing, maybe a few thousand. My current plan is to get these accounted for and rollover into Fidelity in order to consolidate it.

**Current non-retirement Savings:** $5,000 (goal is to have 10-12k for a 6-months of expenses as savings. I think I could realistically hit this goal by Aug-Sept)

**Current debt:** 

* ~$200 Balance / $500 limit (College credit card, 14.9%. Plan is to payoff and close. Never payed any attention to the APR, but account has been open for 5+ years with roughly 50% balance maintained)

* 55k (ish) student loans (mix of Federal unsub. &amp; sub. loans, rates range between 2.75% and 5.05%)

**Credit History:** Pulled my credit back in March for all 3 bureaus, one of them listed my FICO in the low-700s. I've never borrowed more than 3k, no defaults and all have been paid in full. Never had any auto/home loans, have generally always paid cash for this kind of stuff.

* No medical bills appear on these reports, but I was in a car accident back in 2015 and went to the hospital. No debt collectors or any collections on credit reports... Honestly not sure what to do about these and I have no info on them.

**Current Plan:** I intend to save 1-1.5k into savings until I reach my 12k goal to establish 6-months of expenses. After that I want to take that same monthly 1-1.5k (maybe even more), but dollar-coast average it into ETF/stocks whatever. I assume the best way to do this is via a Roth IRA (since I'm still in the lower-half of all tax brackets).

personalfinance,Would it be a bad idea to open 5+ credit card accounts in a short amount of time (1 day)? My credit score is low because I only have one account.,"Hi, I am someone who moved to the United States one year ago and I'm trying to get my credit as high as possible. It is currently around 675 (Vantage). Here are the reasons why my credit score is low according to Capital One and Chase:

* I only have one credit account, and it has been opened for only 7 months.
* High credit usage. I only have a $1000 credit limit with my BoA credit card, and they refuse to raise it. So if I'm not careful, I can reach this limit. I try my best to pay my balance multiple times per month, but sometimes I make large purchases and reach the limit in a single day.
* Low available credit. I only have a $1000 credit limit.

My plan to fix this is to get a bunch of new credit cards to raise my available credit, lower my credit usage, and increase the amount of accounts I have. This would unfortunately lower my average account age, but it's already very low. It will also create many hard inquiries. So I'm thinking that my credit score will take a hit for a year or so, but then it will get much better over time as I'll have more accounts and their average age will just increase.

This leaves me with the following questions:

1. Does this sound like a good plan to increase my credit score?
2. How many credit cards should I open to maximize my goal? I'm thinking of opening 5 accounts, but I'm not sure if I should do more or less.
3. Any good credit card suggestions that accept lower credit scores and provide a good credit line? While getting cards with good rewards would be nice, I'd rather maximize the amount of credit they provide, while providing no annual fees. I don't care about interest rates or other fees because I do not use credit cards often and am not in a bad financial position.

Here is additional information that might help you understand my financial situation:

* I have never been late on a payment and always pay my balance in full.
* I don't have any debt.
* I am currently renting a place.
* I have a high income and I am in a good financial situation.
* I don't need to use credit cards. I currently just use mine to get rewards, but if it would be better to not use credit cards I could just use my debit card for all purchases.",finance,1655676186
Bitcoin,"Just took out another loan ($20K) to buy Bitcoin... Also, update on the previous loan ($15K) from February.","You may remember me from a post back in mid February where I took out a $15k loan to buy Bitcoin. I won't post the link here due to brigading rules, but you can find it over in r/CryptoCurrency

Well, with prices this low, I'm back at it again. I told myself if Bitcoin ever dropped down to $20k I would take out a loan to buy more. So I did...

I just got approved for a $20k loan with a 4.5% APR which I will be using to buy more Bitcoin at these discounted prices.

Why now?

The thing is, J. Pow keeps raising rates. The higher he raises rates, the more expensive it is to borrow money. So I'm doing this now to lock in a lower interest rate. This time around, I plan to DCA it into BTC much slower. If the macro situation is really as bad as they say, then BTC may still go lower.

The crazy thing is that I managed to get a lower interest rate this time! Back in February, the loan I got was 6% APR, but with the new $20k loan I'm only paying $4.5%! I have no idea why that is. The only thing that changed is that my credit score increased about 50 points, but I don't think that really explains it.

With the $15k loan I started DCAing it into BTC daily around February 23rd, 2022, a day or two before Russia invaded Ukraine. Within 8 weeks I had invest the full $15k at a cost basis of \~$38k. In retrospect, I should have spread it out longer, like 16 weeks instead of just 8. I won't make that mistake this time. I plan to DCA this current loan in BTC at $125 per day over the next 5 months or so... unless we drop to $13k, then I'll lump sum whatever is left.

I basically view this as a reverse DCA. Together, the combined loans require about $550 a month to service. I can afford this. Not a big deal.  I usually invest about $500-700 a month anyway, so it's still affordable for me. In fact, I'll most likely pay both of them off early just so that I save on the interest, not that it's much anyway.

My plan is simple: acquire and hold Bitcoin. I have no intention of selling, but if I did, I'd wait until at least 2032  because by then there will have been 3 halvings and 99% of Bitcoin will have been mined. So I think the price by then will be well over $100k if not $250k. But I'd rather just never sell at all.

Anyway, I will update in 6 months.",cryptocurrency,1655676560

I'm a set it and forget it kind of person so I never looked at it. And here we are. I've spent the last week feeling sick to my stomach, but have accepted my mistake and am looking to cut my losses. 

A little more about me: I work for the government and have  maxed out my TSP for the past ten years. No debt. Dual career federal employees with a toddler and a babe on the way. We have a hefty emergency fund, index funds, and are saving for a down payment on a house in the future. 

The policy has a surrender value of 90K and the death benefit is over 1.3m.The surrender charge now is 10K versus $0 in December 2024.  I was hoping to talk to another financial planner to help me understand the policy and for advice on what to do. But I'm realizing that the guy who sold me the policy is a financial planner and I don't know who to turn to anymore. 

What's a reliable source to get advice from in this situation? Should I continue the policy with way reduced premiums because I'm already in this deep? I'm looking into term life insurance and trying to read the policy as thoroughly as I can. 

Thanks for any advice.",finance,1655680463
personalfinance,Buying pricey NYC condo - are we crazy?,"Sorry in advance for the long post. Essentially we have a shot at a super low interest rate and $500K of inheritance at hand, and are trying to determine how much we can spend / should spend on an apartment for our family's primary residence ---- or if we should keep renting our place a bit longer and do something else with the money.

Super long version:

My partner -- EDIT: we're happily married; all the money in one pot. Sorry for the confusion! -- and I have lived in Manhattan for a decade and have two little-little ones. While we've considered NYC suburbs, we have a great friend community in our neighborhood and see raising our kids here. We are planning on going the public school route (our toddler has a public 3K spot for the fall), or at least doing that for elementary school and then maybe re-evaluating the burbs vs city choice as the oldest approaches middle school ...

We rent a market-rate 2 bed/1 bath apt for $3200/mo and are betting on a sizable rent hike ($400? $500? More?) in Aug. We could definitely keep living here for another year or two, but I think it'll begin to feel tight eventually (esp if we add a third kid in...)

So we're thinking about buying now, partly because of a \~$500K inheritance from my grandfather and partly because there is a First Republic Bank program in our neighborhood that still offers really low interest rates: a loan of under $1M just rose to 3.25% a few weeks ago (a loan of $1M-1.4M is 4%). **So the goal would be to make a big downpayment and get the mortgage at that 3.25%, fingers crossed....** Our initial budget, we were thinking $1.4-1.6M.

We found a 3 bed/2.5 bath place we *really* like, love the location, feel we could actually grow into size-wise (2000 sq ft!), is under market value price-per-square foot and only needs cosmetic renovations but is totally livable til we get around to those. It's a condo, so if we live there for 7-10 years and want to move out, we could rent it out instead of sell (a v similar unit across the hall is renting for $6000/mo as of a year ago, not so much less than our monthly payment would be). It's def pricier than we were planning on, but my other grandfather is willing to lend us up to $200k at 4% interest with interest-only payments for a while, and we'd pay back lumps of the principal every 6 months or so depending on budget surplus. and knock the interest payments lower.

All that said...do these numbers make financial sense?

Purchase price: **$1,775,000** (a $1M mortgage at HOPEFULLY 3.25% if we can hurry into contract and lock it in, with a downpayment of $775,000 made up of the $500K inheritance, the interest-only $200K loan at 4%, and $75K of our own assets. *Alternatively*, we could divest some of our stock portfolio and decrease the grandfather loan. We just figured it would be better financially longterm to avoid selling low AND paying some cap gains, and take a loan instead). Mortgage and grandfather interest would come to around $5000/mo, decreasing eventually to \~$4300/mo as we pay my grandfather back.

Common charges: $1100/month

Taxes: $460/month (according to Streeteasy; there was an abatement that recently ended...)

Home insurance: Honestly unsure...$50/mo? 200/mo? More?

Closing costs: \~$50k

Moving fees and initial sprucing-up costs: $10k?

We have no other debt at all.

We jointly earn $330,000-400,000 gross depending on how the year's sales are going. Our average monthly net income is around $18K (but could have a tighter month) and average expenses with our current place are around $10-12K (we estimate closer to $14,500 with this new place...). Our jobs both have good growing potential, though my partner vastly out-earns me so if he were to lose his job in a recession (heaven forbid), we would hurt a lot more than if it were me. Also, there are expenses like $300 a month for biweekly cleaning that we could cut.

Assets:

Cash: $190k

Brokerage: $285k (sob - was $350k when we started looking earlier this spring...)

401k: $230k (currently each socking away 10% of salaries off the top; could scale this back for a year or two)

We've also got money in kids' 529s and occasionally get money from a family business investment.

So....are we dreaming too riskily? If we found a cheaper place at $1.6M, the $1M mortgage would be the same every month; we just wouldn't have my grandfather's loan (and common charges/taxes could be higher than this place if we aren't careful). But maybe renting for 1-3 years and then looking out into Westchester after all is smarter...?",finance,1655681099

stocks,Should I be concerned about my basis in Amazon at $150. Split adjusted,"Foolishly back in January I purchased a big block of Amazon stock at $3000 for sure which is $150 split adjusted today.   Typically I would think I would be OK but the storm clouds are pretty strong for the following reasons below.

1. Labor unions trying to organize Amazon employees.  
2. Cost of fuel for domestic deliveries. Also for getting items from port to warehouses.
3.  Cost of shipping containers from China to USA.
4.  Consumers backing off on any type of spending due to inflation issues they face.  
5.  Federal reserve plans at least three more rate hikes of .75 each  is each rate hike is put into effect it will drive the market down further.  

I am sure there are more storm clouds but it concerns me that the economy won’t recover for several years because everything that is happening around us today is unprecedented.  

Any thoughts on where you think Amazon might be 12 months from now. I have the ability to buy more shares at the lower price so I could work on DCA but I’m not sure where at the low point yet.",finance,1655688457

I had my first job for 7 months, my second job for 2 years, my third job for 3 months, and my current job that is the same as my second job just a better paying owner I've been working for for a year. I have a car that I bought with cash and I had an apartment but it was a private landlord so I have no record of it besides withdrawing money to pay it each month. I currently live with my dad and I pay him 240 dollars a month. I would like to take out a mortgage on a house but I'm young and I have just now gotten my first credit card so for the next 6 months it will still show I don't have a credit score. 
I've done my research into mortages closing costs and interest rated etc. But I feel I won't qualify but I hope that a mortgage lender would look at the money I've saved and thing that I can't be spending money willy nilly to have that much at 20 years old. I'm just looking to see if I have a chance of qualifying and if so what are my best options I'm afraid of getting a really high interest rate. Also I make 17 dollars an hour as a manager it's not great but I've made it work.

stocks,What is holding up the job market?,"Can anyone explain why the unemployment rate still remains fairly low?

For example this article from the [Kansas City Fed](https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/how-many-workers-are-truly-missing-from-the-labor-force/#:~:text=The%20recovery%20in%20the%20labor,to%20their%20pre%2Dpandemic%20levels.) talks about:

* Main cause is that Americans 65+ are slow to return to work.
* There's also some other considerations such as slower population growth and slow down of immigration.

My question is:

* What do you think are the major causes of the tight job market?
* Are these causes temporary (will fix themselves in 6-12 months) or reflect long term trends.

For example, if you think job market is tight due to too many people getting government checks or making a ton of money in Bitcoin/stocks, then surely that's going to change in the next 3-6 months.

I think this question is important because the tight job market and high consumer spending seems to be the key pillars holding back a deep recession (for now). It would be good to know if the good employment numbers will remain steady in the long term or is it about to crash (if you think it will crash, why)?",finance,1655692048

personalfinance,Why is my soft/hard credit pull so different?,"I just purchased a new car and did a pre-qualification to estimate my interest rate. It based it on a soft pull and came up with a score of 712. It’s similar on Credit Karma and Experian too. After the hard inquiry when I officially applied for the loan, my score came back at 797. 

Why are these numbers so different? I based my loan options on that pre-qualification, and now I realize that I probably could have got a better rate knowing my score was so much higher.

personalfinance,Quality of life vs More money Question/Financially Secure Future,"I have been working a rotating 12 hour shift schedule for 15 years. My wife and I are in our mid 30's with a 5 and 7 year old. My wife is a teacher 11 years into her career. I'm at the point in life where improving the quality of it is taking priority over salary. I'm 15 years in w/ my current company and make a salary of 180-190K annually. I have an offer with a reputable company for a similar position but the salary is 120K. 

Current Company= Roughly 12-15% company contribution to my 401k each year.

New Company= 100% match up to 8% and typically a 3-5% bonus at the EOY (not guaranteed)

I want to take the job being that it is a regular 5day/8hour work week M-F. However due to our current income we went a little aggressive on our mortgage term. That being said, I would have to supplement my income w/ the new company for 5-6 years until I was mortgage free. Main question I have is, Can I supplement my income to match what I am accustomed to by taking early distributions from my current 401K.

401K is fully vested with balance of $600K. What I'm hoping to be able to do would be........

1. Take the job
2. Convert 401K to Trad. IRA
3. Purchase individual stocks, sell covered calls on enough of the equities
4. Use premiums collected from the options to supplement my income until mortgage free.

I am estimating to need an additional $1500-$2000/month bring home with the lower salary. My calculation of how much i would need to withdrawal each month is below

Current Income Bracket-22%

Early Distribution Penalty-10%

State Income Tax-5%

Withdrawal Amount-$3200

Federal Taxes-(-$700)

Penalty-(-$320)

State Taxes-(-$160)

Bring Home Amount- $2000ish/month

63. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss.

74. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
75. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

77. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources.

88. Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill.

Bitcoin,I Am 66% Slave,"I recently read Knut Svanholm’s “Bitcoin: Everything Divided by 21 Million” and within the book there is a section that discusses all of the various ways we are taxed on our time.

There are direct taxes that impact me and my earning potential such as income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, state and local taxes. There are also indirect taxes that affect me in ways that are a bit more difficult to quantify like inflation (an invisible tax that diminishes the purchasing power for the dollars I keep) and corporate taxes (revenue that could have all or in part gone into employee salaries).

Months prior I listened to a podcast with Robert Breedlove where he discussed the idea that one’s effective tax rate is a representation of how much a slave one is to the state. A statement I felt was bold, but the argument was interesting: what is slavery if not a 100% tax on your time and energy?

I decided to take the challenge and determine how much a ""slave"" I really am. I reviewed my paycheck, my property tax bill, my monthly purchases and my state tax rate. The result ~~surprised me to say the least~~ **sounds about right**.

Here are the numbers represented **as a percentage of my gross income**:

* Federal Income Tax: ~~26.16%~~ **17.36%**
* State Income Tax: ~~10.66%~~ **7.08%**
* Medicare Tax: ~~2.16%~~ **1.44%**
* Disability Tax: ~~1.64%~~ **1.09%**
* Social Security Tax: ~~9.25%~~ **6.14%**
* Property Tax: ~~4.94%~~ **3.28%**
* Monthly Expense Sales Tax (@ 7.75% rate): ~~2.71%~~ **0.15%**
* **Total Tax:** ~~57.52%~~ **36.53%**

And that’s just explicit taxes. The latest Consumer Price Inflation print for June 2022 was 8.6%. Simply adding the CPI figure into the sum puts me at a ~~66.12%~~ **45.13%** total tax rate.

For every 3 hours of work, the value created by 2 is taken from me and given to the government.

I am ~~66%~~ **45%** ~~slave~~ **serf**. How about you?

EDIT:

There were essentially 4 types of comments:

1. ""You're a moron and did your math wrong."" These people were right. Totally did my math wrong and have updated the values.
2. ""You're a moron to compare your lifestyle to slavery."" I don't know if they are right, but slavery does have a harsh association with it so I'll go with ""serf"" instead.
3. ""You're a moron and bitcoin doesn't fix this."" My post didn't say that it does, but it does. Bitcoin cannot be confiscated and cannot be inflated to more than 21,000,000. By these features alone, the total tax rate on the individual would be lessened.
4. ""Roads."" Yes, I use roads. However, I think the collective population would be a better, more efficient capital allocator than most government.",cryptocurrency,1655708168
Bitcoin,why not sell now and pick up a bigger piece of BTC at a lower price later?,"It seems inflation will continue going up thus the fed will keep increasing rates(crashing markets more and likely sending crypto prices even lower) so why not sell my very little piece of BTC(also getting a capital loss that can be used to lower taxes later, yes i got into BTC at a way higher price and didnt sell before cuz i was hodling hardcore and thought price would recover) at $20K and pick a bigger piece of btc later when is at 17K (yeah i am gambling entire crypto market couldngo even lower). Is not a bad idea or i am missing something?",cryptocurrency,1655713279
CryptoCurrency,Random reminder: Don't be naive!,"Don't be fooled by a tiny rally.

The crypto market is crashing because of interest rate hikes (because debt becomes more expensive and people suddenly wants less of it). Inflation is not dealt with yet and we'll see more rate hikes. 

Worst case scenario is a global housing crash and financial meltdown. Crypto has never seen that before, but we can be pretty sure it won't thrive in those conditions either.

Don't buy crypto now unless you've got money to spare and you are prepared to hold for several years. 

Save some money for your debt, or to buy into housing if that market crashes too.

Edit: There seem to be some confusion about what my ""advice"" really is. 

I'm not saying that crypto will definitely keep declining, although it's likely, but rather that there is an alternative cost to your investments as the interest rates increases. It never hurts to have a liquid buffer when there's hard times ahead, and your indirect profits from paying off a 4% mortgage could potentially be higher than profits from crypto investments made now.",cryptocurrency,1655715458

personalfinance,Can you short your 401k?,"To start I am by no means a financial guru and only know basics to my question (short selling).  I plan on eventually taking a 401k loan to purchase my first house.  I've been looking for a house for over a year but I'm not willing to buy in this market (only 4 homes available in my desired county and in my price range to begin with).  This gives me time to save to avoid a loan completely and continue saving.  However, I'm still curious if I take out a 401k loan does the plan holder sell off the shares from the money I'm borrowing?  My thought process is if I'm inevitably taking out a loan and I anticipate a bear market in the future.  If I borrow the lump sum now (put it in savings) and the market continues to dive over the next year I'd in essence be shorting my 401k by buying the shares back at a lower price over the duration of the loan.

investing,Fixed duration bond ETFs long run returns and volatility in an era of consistently rising rates like the 1970s,"Bond ETFs that hold only a specific duration are a very popular investment vehicle nowdays for portfolio construction. For example, $IEF holds US treasury bonds with expiration between 7 and 10 years.  With yields going from 0.5% to 3.2% in the span of two years, these types of funds, specifically long duration ones, have taken a massive hit: for example $IEF is down almost 20%, which one could argue is pretty volatile for a bond funds that invests in risk-free assets.

If we were to see a long period of consistently rising rates -something that we haven't seen in 40 years- like the 1960s and 1970s where yields went from 3.5% all the way to more than 15%, I do wonder what would be the long term performance of the funds and their volatility during this period, untile rates start going back down again. We have really nothing to compare this or backtest, since bonds were much different back then, they were callable.

For example, In a scenario where the US10Y goes to 15% -I know it's probably highly unlikely- does $IEF really fall another 70% from where it is today before going back up? Does it not? How is the long term CAGR affected? What is the volatility? Because I assume that if these funds just keep rolling over their bonds to keep the maturity fixed, they are just going to take loss after loss. They are not holding bonds until maturity. Are these funds going to run out of fashion and utility if people realize they are money losers in a rising interest rate enviroment?",finance,1655738153

I believe there's a lot of companies that have value in there and I'm waiting to get a good deal on them. In the meanwhile, I'm looking to the past two significant downturns to better understand from a (% likelihood) when that might be. My first question is:

\- The Dot Com Bubble peaked around March 2000. It bottomed out in Sep 2002. Any ideas why it took so long? Was it due to Septmber 11 or the 2001 recession? Any other significant factors I'm missing here. Did the enron situation have a major impact?

\- Another signal is the average time since the start of the downturn/market turbulence.

In the last major recession the peak was around June 2007 and it bottomed out around March 2009, around 21 months.

\- I'm also looking at the situation with the speculative assets in each of these major downturns, as they have been significantly depreciated near the bottoms (speculative tech stocks were down 90%-99% near the bottom of the dot com bubble, the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index was down 20% two years after the 2007 peak)

\- Currently Bitcoin, GME, and NFTs have still not fully depreciated to 90%+. Housing is still expensive, while the price probably won't decline like it did in 2007, I'd still expect a correction with the interest rates and layoffs.

Anyways thanks for listening to me ramble. I work as a data scientist, and I enjoy building quantitative models for hard to predict events. If you have any other data points you think might be relevant to perform a statistical analysis to find a market bottom, that would be greatly appreciated!

Other Data Points I'm considering

\- P/E future 12 months ratios

\- Moving Averages

\- Unemployment figures

\- Inflation % (Whether it shows easing)

To start off, I've (F26) been thinking about moving out lately. I've been living with my parents to save money ever since I graduated college. I'm getting fed up and want my own space because I think it'll benefit my mental health. With that in mind, I'm not sure how much I should be spending per month on rent. I've looked through the internet and have seen suggestions, but my situation is different. 

I have a remote job that I make 50k a year at with the chances of small commission bonuses, monthly I make around $2600. I do have a retirement plan I'm funding. I thankfully don't have any student debt as i was lucky to get a large FAFSA grant and able to pay my way through school for the rest the FAFSA didn't cover. On top of that, I have a brand new 2021 car that I've fully paid off now. 

So I have reliable transportation, no financial debt, and a low car insurance payment ($200 every 6 months). I'm on a family phone plan because it's cheaper for all of us. With this information, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions of what my max monthly rent could be. Where I live it's hard to get anything at 1k a month. 

Again, I don't want to sound like I'm just flexing because I've been very lucky financially. I just want help and suggestions please

I recently accepted an offer for a job on the other side of the country.  It is essneitally my dream job; I've applied to it a few times over the last 10 years and 4 years ago they even offered me the job but i declined the offer because relocation wasn't included and at the time i really couldn't afford to move.  I have no idea how to correctly figure out what to do financially. I feel like i have too many questions that I don't know how to accurately answer.

**My current financial situation** (forwarning, it's terrible. i have been trying to fix my finances but i was a mess when i was yougner &amp; irresponsible):

*  I'm 31 and currently live in upstate NY (let's say Albany, NY for the purposes of this thread)
*  I bought a house in 2017 w/a $190k mortgage at 3.875%.  I currently have $160k left. My house currently has a market value of about $260k (was recently reappraised).  Putting me at about $100k in equity.  My monthly mortgage principal, interest, and escrow payments are at about $1600/month. After rebaes, I pay about $12k in property and school tax each year. 
* Utilities in total range from $500-600/month (cell phone, internet, gas, electric, netflix lol)
* I currently make \~$105k+ from my FT job and have additional income from a serving job on nights/weekends. 
* In 2020 i started a debt consolidation plan (probably one of my dumber decisions) to consolidate CC debt that had gotten out of control.  The debt at the time was about $40k. (started low but i couldn't catch up due to interest)  At the current time I have about $10.8k left and pay about $800 month towards that program (therefore roughly 14 months left if i don't pay it down faster).  
* However, this was through a company that negotiates the debt for you with your creditors, but in order to do so they told me I had to stop making payments on my debt.  Thus resulting in my credit score and credit history being significantly negatively impacted (dropped to the 500s). 
* My current credit scores are about 765/740/680 from the 3 bureaus.  At the current time the credit history now only reflects one of the previous 4 debts with a creditor to be deliquent/in collections.  The previous 4 debts have been paid and negotiated with the creditors such that they updated my credit history to no longer reflect the deliquent payments/no longer be in collections.
* I do not have any other monthly debts. My car and student loans were all paid off in the last 8 months (YAY!)
* I have (had?) a significant amount of money in $401ks and Roth IRAs for retirement, and i don't plan on touching that (especially due to the current stock market).

&amp;#x200B;

**New job info:**

* I will be moving to Bremerton, WA area. 
* My new salary will be almost $120k. With the potential for up to 25% additional for OT &amp; travel.
* I do not know yet if any relocation assistance will be provided.  They are currently in the process of trying to get me some sort of assistance.

I have around $5k in my savings account now. This was orignally planned to be partially an emergency fund &amp; savings for a new vehicle. I need a larger car because i have 2 giant dogs and my current car is a sedan that requires premium gas. I wanted to make this 'new' car my daily driver - however the car market has also gone up an insane amoutn such that what i was planning on being able to afford (\~$25k car) now is like $34k? maybe? and at that price point i'd rather just get a new hybrid car. (however now i recognize we're talking about needs vs. wants)

As far as a new house out in WA, and from what i can find, the cheaper end of what i'm looking for is about $450k.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to accurately figure out what i can afford in terms of a house. Which means i don't know if i should sell now or rent and live in temporary housing out in WA.   Interest rates are crazy high so it seems like renting my current house and having temporary housing makes sense, however finding a place that allows large dogs and has a fenced in yard seems to put me at about $3800 a month without utilities.  Also, I am not 100% sure about property tax (should i be looking for state property tax and county? or county/city, etc?).  Also my credit score sucks right now so i'll be on the higher end of any potential mortgage interest rates.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't figure out what I'll be paying in terms of income tax (WA doesn't seem to have income tax (i think?) but i'll still owe federal income tax) so I'm not exactly sure how to figure out what my net income will be monthly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where can i find more resources for some of these questions? Is there someone i can talk to (financial advisor?) that might be able to help?

personalfinance,Trying to figure out how much house we can afford for a second home or if we should sell our first home and use the equity as a down payment.,"Howdy y’all!  My wife and I are trying to start a family and will be out growing our home whenever that happens. We are trying to figure out if we would be able to buy a second home and rent out our current home or if we are going to have to sell our current home to be able to afford it. Some specifics for y’all:

Combined income before tax: $141,000

Greater Houston area 

Current mortgage details:
$1400/month, 2.5% interest rate, $118,000 left on balance, estimated value of home $215-225k 

We could rent our house from 1800-2200 a month but haven’t dug to deep into this. This was based of our floor plans being rented in the neighborhood. 


Debt we have: $525/month car payment, 

Other costs:  never sure how to include this in the calculation, we use our credit card for everything we can (bills, gas, food, travel, etc) and we pay it off in full every month which typically averages $4k a month.

TLDR: how much house could I afford if we had a second home?
How much house can I afford if we sell the first and move? 
Any recommendations to one way or the other? 


Really appreciate y’all’s help and advice on this! Y’all are awesome!",finance,1655753010

personalfinance,"Can someone explain how these ""debt settlement"" companies work? More context in the post.","So I'm specifically referring to the companies that offer to ""help"" you get out of debt by basically doing what you could do yourself -- negotiating with the creditor(s) that you owe, paying a reduced amount, etc. But with these companies, it's odd because they usually all start out with a bait &amp; switch tactic (say you're ""pre-approved"" or ""pre-qualified"" for a personal loan up to $xx,xxx amount, then when you attempt to apply they tell you you won't qualify for a loan BUT they have another ""program"" that can help you get out of debt where you pay a monthly payment into a ""savings"" account each month, &amp; they use that money to pay off your debt with the creditor(s) you owe, but at a lower amount/zero interest rate). My brother signed up with one of these companies &amp; he's a few months into the ""program"", &amp; he has seen a couple of accounts get settled, but he told me something I thought was odd.. he noticed a new account on his credit report which showed as a personal loan for the amount of his unsecured debt that he is having settled through this program, even though they told him he didn't qualify for a loan. Do these companies *actually* get you qualified for a loan, not tell you, but have you make payments on it anyway, presumably at a higher rate than if you had just gotten the loan itself (thus making profit on the difference)? Why do people use these companies if all they're doing is ""managing"" a ""savings"" account that you pay into monthly &amp; negotiating  with your creditor(s) when you could just do those things yourself?",finance,1655755631
personalfinance,Help with my choice please....,"I am in a life predicament and fork in the road. I currently have a wife and 3 kids. I was working as a banker for 42k a year near Boise Idaho. I currently live with my Mother-in-law, where we were saving up to buy a house. Well did to COVID, the prices have soared way higher in Idaho than I can afford.
    My mother-in-law and family are on good terms, but she is dating and looking to get remarried in about 2 years to her bf. She is wanting to live on her own for a little bit to get used to that and so is hoping to have us out by September 2023. 
   I applied for a prison chaplain position in central California  paying 62k in October of last year. I was offered a contingent offer of employment in February of this year and made a tough choice to quit my job in early March. I worked out a date of May 2 to start at the prison with the recruiter. We just had to wait for my fingerprints to come back. She said they only take about 2 to 3 weeks and then I will have time to look for housing and move my family. 
   I also quit my job early, because my baby daughter needed some medical treatment and surgery, and we weren't sure how that would all go. My wife wouldn't be handle all of that and the move. My mother-in-law was open to her and the kids staying for a few months to make sure everything was ok and helping out.
   The live scan never came by May 2. The recruiter was livid and it was out of her hands. I have since applied to a bunch of jobs out here in Boise and should be hearing back this week or next. In the time I would have started and waiting for my fingerprints to come back the COL has gone up significantly with gas prices and such. Before, according to my calculations, I would have been able to afford a house that was $350 to 400k with what I have saved up. 
   Now, I would barely be able to afford 320k for a house with interest rates and commute. The cities I would live in are all 30ish miles away from the prison, because you don't want to live in the same town as the prison. 
   The live scan just came back on Thursday and they want me to pick a start date. I just don't know if I can even afford this anymore. I can get a job in Boise and work at a bank and save up money for another year ish, and idk if the housing will keep going up above my savings rate. I can reject a job offer up to 3 times, but I don't know if I can set a date and then back out if I get a job out in Boise. The bank jobs won't pay the 62k a year that the Chaplain will, but at least 50k a year. 
  What is the best move, financially and prudently for my family? To stay in Boise for a year, at least,  and see how things look by next September, or take a leap of faith and do the chaplain job? The Chaplain is government so everyone says more security, but if a recession hits, they can furlough. The rent or mortgage would be almost 50% of my income. Would a bank job be safer in this climate? I have money in the bank, but it is a drop in the bucket with everything going on. I don't even know if I can get a mortgage or rental because now I have been unemployed so long.
    My wife can't work, because my daughter is considered disabled and my other kids are special needs. What should I do and please let me know if you need any more info. My recruiter will be asking for a start date tomorrow and idk if I should be. Keep that open. I have thought about setting one and then seeing what I am offered for the loc bank jobs and then backing out of I get one, because the prison will let me start in a few weeks for moving states.

Edit: There are parts of central California that are very sketchy and before we could have afforded a lower end house in a good neighborhood, but now it seems they are all sketchier neighborhoods we would fall into with rates increased.

personalfinance,Freaking out because my credit score dropped 176 points unfairly! What can I do??,"For some context, I am 19, in March I got my first credit card, a Secured Credit Card from Navy Federal Credit Union, I initially had a 664-credit score after using it pretty heavily the first month but making sure I had 0 balance every time. Essentially what I would do is I would spend anywhere between $20-60 and pay it off the next day. My credit limit is $200.

I did the same exact thing for the month of June; however, it was cut a bit close, my due date is on the 23rd of every month, I accidentally spent too much, and ended up with $183/200 on my credit card.

As soon as I saw this, I IMMEDIATELY paid it, on the 16th &amp; 17th of May. I paid a total of $266,48, so this should've put my credit card WAY in the clear. However, one of the payments was a double charge, I'm not sure how it happened, and I got it reversed on the 25th of May. (2 days after my statement date). And again, on the 31st of May I paid another $140.

I got a notification from my Credit Karma app saying my points dropped 103 points on May 31st. Saying that the $183 wasn't paid, even though as you've read, I paid WAY over on accident. And then on June 4th I dropped another 73 points with NO CONTEXT. Credit Karma says, ""We found no changes to your Transunion credit report."" So, if this is the case, why did I drop ANOTHER 73 points on top of the 103 points that shouldn't have been dropped in the first place??

I'm freaking out because I wanted to build good credit in order to secure a better future for myself. I was doing real estate/Airbnb/etc. when I got a secure job that paid enough to help me invest.

I'm not sure what to do I already disputed the 103-point drop and it's saying I should get a response on the 4th of July. But with my luck in life, I'm not very hopeful for how the resolution will end up.

I've already frozen my card, because I today I was charged $35 for a Leet code subscription I was 100% sure I had cancelled, that I don't have the money to pay for, and I'm scared it'll negatively affect my credit score again.

devops,DevOps doesn't feel technical enough,"Does anyone else feel in a similar way? Please allow me to vent.

I've been a Linux systems engineer and infrastructure architect for 20 years.  I have help deployed USA nationwide data networks with bleeding edge technologies.  I have worked for medical device companies that originate their own protocols out of necessity.  I've completely forklift startups and allow them to scale into a highly competitive midsize business.  So on and so forth.

For the past couple years, in today's vernacular, I've been dubbed a staff cloud architect, &amp; engineer, devops engineer.  It doesn't seem very satisfying to solve developers problems when they never actually have anything technical that's challenging them.  Nor are these infrastructure problems truly challenging because no one is willing to understand how to optimize infrastructure as seen through the eyes of the OSI model.

They only seem to create problems like being blissfully apathetic towards the HTTP headers that they are using, or forcing me to implement protocol manipulation and retries for enterprise resiliency,  get push-back from replacing a centralized database that emulates a message broker with an actual peer-to-peer message broker that could be scaled linearly into infinity.  Don't even get me started on threading, context switching, and cache misses.

Sure, learning AWS, terraform, kubernetes, and all of that has been academically enjoyable, but the culture of implementing these technologies is completely mind-numbing.  

The obsession with mimicking some lossy interpretation of circa 2006 Google methods have tainted everything and made it impossible to apply critical thinking and actually apply without consensus engineering (psychology-based engineering) usurping true engineering design and implementations.

And to top it all off, upper level management severely understaffed our team and expects us to improve upon the infrastructure while we are in a perpetual state of burnout.

The thing is, I know too much to be a Linux systems engineer, and my salary reflects that, and I'm too honest to be a director. I'm stuck in some sort of purgatory.

cybersecurity,Thoughts on CTMS,"Recently I interviewed for a position with CISA through the Cyber talent Management System (CTMS), so I decided to write up and post my thoughts on the process. And hold on, it's going to be long.

**TL;DR:** If you're not just starting out (and even then), maybe wait until the bugs are worked out.

To start, I am a current federal employee, and mostly applied to understand the process.

**Background:** CTMS, in theory, is CISA's answer the extended government hiring process and relatively low pay scale. However, since the program launched in November 2021 and the first new hire was onboarded at the beginning of June, it clearly has some bugs to work out.

**Levels and pay:** CTMS has five tracks based on experience and career path. 

* Entry track: 0-2 years experience (not including internships), $60-90k/yr (roughly GS-9 to GS-12 step 2, which is about 3 years progression). This is meant for the folks just graduating, looking to get a foot in the door.
* Developmental track: 3+ years, $74-110k/yr (GS-11 to GS-13 step 2, again 3 years progression). 
* Technical, Leadership, Executive tracks: 5+ years, start at $94/110/155k respectively, all go above $200k.

**The Process:**

I began the process in mid-November, basically when it became available. All jobs are posted on [usajobs.gov](https://usajobs.gov) but CTMS specific jobs can be found on [dhscs.usajobs.gov/](https://dhscs.usajobs.gov/). As such, you need to create a profile. For me, since I already had one, it took about an hour to find and update all the necessary documentation. The initial application process has you select a track (I went with developmental as I was over 2 years, and missed the ""not including internships""), a primary area, e.g. digital forensics, incident management, risk management, etc., and an option secondary area, which has some overlap with the primary area. I think you're supposed to be able to apply multiple times and select multiple primary/secondary areas, but I wasn't able to.

Once you apply, you'll get a response within an hour or so inviting you to take the Phase 1 Assessment. This needs to be completed within a few days. It's a two part test that doesn't require specific DHS or cyber knowledge. The first part is more general office navigation and general cyber security questions and is somewhat scenario based, i.e. someone in the office asks about ""x"", which of these choices is the correct response. The second part is more of a personality test, basically ""which of these two statements do you agree with more"" kind of thing. These tests took me about 2 hours with a 30 minute break between them.

After completing the Phase 1 Assessment, you'll get your notification within an hours or so and, assuming you pass and aren't in the entry track, instructions for the Phase 2 Assessment. This assessment is a proctored test with 3 hours allotted. This test is based on the areas selected in the application, so if you chose risk management, it's going to cover NIST and NSTMs among other things, and does expect the level of knowledge associated with the track that was chosen. The biggest annoyance here is finding a testing center with an opening. The one I found was an hour away, but I had the results in my email by the time I got home. So far, this process has only taken about 3-4 days, which isn't too bad. Of course, that's when things started to take longer.

After successfully completing Phase 2, I had to wait a month to get instruction on the Phase 3 Assessment, so right before Christmas. This is a recorded interview, meaning, the questions are shown on screen and you record yourself answering the questions. You have a couple minutes to prepare your answer and three attempts to answer the question in a way that you like before submitting the answer. It's about 10 questions, so pretty standard interview length. Plan for 45 minutes or so, but it can be done on your computer, and you don't have to submit a video recording, at least I didn't. I then had to wait another month, or late January, for the results to tell me I wasn't qualified for the developmental track, since the year I spent as a full-time intern doing threat hunt/incident response didn't count, but they would keep my information for a year if I was interested in the entry track (I'm not, but I was annoyed so I didn't bother to say no).

So now, here I am 7 months after clicking ""apply"", I've interviewed for a position, and was told to expect a response in about a month. Assuming that's a TJO, I would need a background check and drug screen, however since I already hold the required clearance, I wouldn't need to wait 6-8 months for that. And the best part is, to move between tracks you need to reapply, which means, I assume, going through the entire application process again. 

**Bottom Line/My Thoughts:** 

* If you're just getting started, this is a good way to get a couple years experience (and a security clearance), if you can handle the potential wait. If you have a BS, you're starting pay here is actually higher than on the GS scale (GS-7 is about $50k/year). You can also take advantage of the training opportunities available.
* If you're more experienced and want to try to protect assets vital to the nation, deal with leading teams, or impact national policy, it's also a good deal, as the pay tops out significantly above the GS scale (I know, it's not all about the money, but money is going to be a factor), you're bringing your expertise to protect the nation, and hopefully helping to train the folks on the entry track. 
* Ultimately, the only time it doesn't make much sense is if you're in that developmental range or want to stay with the government longer term from an entry level position, as most GS career ladders will range from GS7 through at least 12, sometimes 13, so there's no need to reapply unless you want to change what you're doing until then.",technology,1655761322

I don't mean to be a pessimist, since the launch of the Robinhood stock and crypto currency trading application, I've hyped up the crypto currency market more than lord willing but DogeCoin and Orchid (Just to name a few) are a pretty fair indicator that the non-correlative bounce back of pop culture, hot topic crypto currency names such as Ethereum and Bitcoin are working as a temporary pull at market trust with too tempting short term yields for longtime traders who have historically taken advantage of the longterm holding market. It's choosing to drink the Wacco Seige KoolAid when the stock market and foreign exchange currency markets are doing so good among current foreign affairs. Not to mention the taxes and, U.S. admitted, higher interest rates and low yielding bonds.

personalfinance,How to budget for unknown condo deficiency assessment?,"Hi - longtime lurker, first time poster on anon account.

I lost my home last year, burned down to the ground in a wildfire. I had only owned the condo for a year so my savings were slowly getting rebuilt since. My question is how to budget for an upcoming deficiency assessment (assessed by the condo HOA due to underinsurance). 

The owners have all been told to expect a deficiency assessment. The problem is no one knows when it would be assessed or for how much. I've been told it could be by the end of the summer or in a couple years after rebuilding is complete. The owners have been told to expect an assessment per unit well in excess of the average loss assessment coverage that most people have through their individual HO6 insurance which is $25k. Based off this, I'm assuming the deficiency assessment will be upwards of $50-60k. Unfortunately, I only have $10k in assessment coverage through my insurance. 

How should I budget/save for this? I got a payout from my insurance for personal property (not enough to cover the assessment, only about $20k) that I currently haven't touched (just using my savings to slowly replace items). I may have the option of using a Small Business Administration loan to cover the assessment with a super low interest rate of 1.4% but they keep changing their story. My insurance payout is currently sitting in a bank account as cash, but what would you do? I don't see how I can do I bonds because I might need the money before a year is up and I'm nervous about investing in the current market. I'm also not in a position to sell due warrantability issues and I could not afford to buy a different place or sustainably rent in my location (HCOL).

defi,Warning on Vires Finance: It is effectively insolvent...,"tl:dr:  Vires Finance looted $540M from suckers to cash out Waves/USDN.  It is probably insolvent.  If you have any outstanding supply for anything, withdraw now.

More details:

Looking at the borrowing/depositing for USDT/USDC and USDN (Neutrino), it looks like Vires is almost insolvent, having been used as a massive amount of exit liquidity for big Waves bagholders.

Waves/Neutrino are like Luna/Terra: the latter is an algorithmic stablecoin backed by the former and one can convert back and forth as long as the peg is solid.

Now Waves has a ""market cap"" of only $500M.  If one wanted to sell, say $600M of Waves you would totally crash the price before you are even through 1% of the amount.

But you convert the Waves to Neutrino, and then use the Neutrino to borrow USDT/USDC and voila, cashout.  Yes, you are ""paying"" 30%+ interest on your borrowing, and have to take a 10% haircut,  but the goal is never pay it back, just take the money and run.

And it looks like that is what has happened.  Some $640M of Neutrino was pledged as collateral over the past few month and used to borrow $250M in Tether and $290M in Circle from suckers obviously attracted to the Ponzi interest rates.

So if you have anything ""invested"" in the Vires Finance effectively-a-ponzi-scheme, withdraw it now.  Because you won't be able to later, as you were the Waves wales exit liquidity.",cryptocurrency,1655777810

We used about $11k for the actual down deposit for closing costs and used the rest of the gifts as support for the new home. 

I am hoping to keep the townhome as they have already moved out at the start of this month. I make about $70k a year. I would have no issues affording this place at the current interest rate. 

I am very green about what to do with refinancing. Currently the offer is to get my ex off of the mortgage with a refinance and offer a $10k buy out (plus some of the equity they put into monthly payments). 

Obviously I'm concerned about the increasing interest rates. Is it even possible to keep my current rates and get my ex off of the mortgage/quit claims? How much more can I expect to pay a month if I have to refinance at these current rates?

Asset A costs 100$ --&gt; 1=(10;0)  2=(5;500)

To keep your risk constant you essentially want to keep the ratios inside your portfolio constant. If A goes to 200$, portfolio 1 won't change much, expect it's now worth 2000$. Portfolio 2, however, is worth (5*200; 500) = 1500$, and to manage your risk you *rebalance* it back to 50/50:

You search x such as (x*200 ; 750) = 1500$ -&gt; x = 3.75 

If price for A then goes back to 100$, portfolio 1 would be worth 1000$ again, but #2 would be worth (375; 700) = 1075$.

It works the same way if A decreases in value before going back to its original value. By rebalancing, you effectively eliminate more risks than you concede gains.

This works particularly well when associated with a DCA strategy: you always have an influx of cash and never run out of funds to invest when price falls, and sell generally less during rallies because your $ leg is passively increasing over time. If you really wish to go the extra mile, you can try to farm yields with each asset into your portfolio; traditional markets usually replace the $ leg by state bonds, for instance. The yield of theses very bonds dictates what is considered ""too much risk"": if asset A is expected to gain 3%/year in value, but bond yields are 5%/year, then there's no point in investing in A in the first place, unless you're into gambling with bad odds.

This is the crux of portfolio theory.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory
Volatility is usually used as a proxy to measure risk, and bond yields are used as a ""risk-free"" yield proxy. With both metrics, you can calculate the optimal portfolio allocation with the best expected returns.
I won't get into the details here, but the result of all this is that, as long as you can get a bond yield &gt; 0%, there is a portfolio (A;$) that will perform **strictly better** than an ""all-in"" *no matter what the price does* . In essence, not diversifying, or not keeping some $ on the side to react to the market, is unnecessary risk.

A good strategy is a strategy that doesn't rely on price prediction, but profits from price movements (or lack thereof). And as always, don't invest more than you can afford to.

Bitcoin,Is it a good thing or a bad thing for cryptocurrencies to become legal tender ?,"Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that locks the ""global currency"" class, and its function as a store of value has been recognized by the world and Wall Street.

There is no denying that Bitcoin is a consensus, but there are important underlying values behind the formation of a consensus: Bitcoin offers people another option, a fairer monetary policy. According to the output mechanism of the Bitcoin white paper, the following two Fixed rules:

❶ Bitcoin produces blocks approximately every 10 minutes, and every time a new block is created, a new bitcoin is minted.

❷The number of cryptocurrency rewards is adjusted every 210,000 blocks produced by Bitcoin. 21 million is the upper limit of the Bitcoin supply and no one, no government, can change it, which is what makes Bitcoin so powerful.

The second and more important underlying value is Censorship Resistance, which means that a technology has the ability to make the government ""unstoppable"". Censorship-resistant technology is not about replacing the established order and making everything unmanageable. It's about providing new options for people to co-exist with the established order.

Bitcoin doesn’t take away the state's control over legal tender; rather, more subtly, it makes legal tender less absolutely important.

From a technical point of view, it's based on the logic of the Internet and computer computing.

Blockchain technology is powerful in that for the first time it has successfully enabled the internet to 'deliver value'.

Including Gary Gensler of MIT Sloan School of Management (currently Chairman of the SEC), who believes that blockchain technology opens up entirely new possibilities for humanity.

Bitcoin can't only co-exist with other fiat currencies and be used on a daily basis, this initiative brings more freedom to people and government.

People are given an additional 'Plan B' option to avoid the collateral damage of vicious inflation caused by the wrong monetary policy of the local government. The Government of the Republic of El Salvador/Central African Republic is no longer completely subject to foreign monetary policies such as those of the US and international sanctions, and has gained more fiscal autonomy. It was only after the Russo-Ukrainian war that everyone realised how important a neutral currency was.

Bitcoin, as the most neutral currency in the world, will not reject any country or people, and there are no currency controls or foreign exchange sanctions. If more countries, governments and corporate organisations join in the future, El Salvador and Central Africa Republic, as early participants, will gain disproportionate advantages and benefits in the future, and may have the opportunity to tear down the black pages of the past and leapfrog into the Singapore and Israel of the Web 3.0 generation.",cryptocurrency,1655801726

investing,Public service announcement :) This is one of those weird times when Treasuries pay more than CDs. 1 year approx 2.8% vs cds best rates 2.1%,"And if you are on a big brokerage like Vanguard, you can even get 2.8% for a brokered cd of 1 year remaining.  So originating a 1 year cd from a bank right now is silly.  I believe this only happens in times of rapidly rising fed rates, for obvious reasons- banks need a little time to catch up, or they are cashing in on people renewing at low rates without really checking for better rates. Probably a huge bonanza for banks since they can invest that same money easily and safely at almost 1 percent higher.

EDIT and as one commenter pointed out, you need to hold to maturity of 1 year for both Treasuries and CDs to get the full return. Unlike CDs you originated at a bank you don't get 100% face value/par back if you sell early, which makes sense since you are buying them at a discount, which represents all or part of the return in addition to interest, if any.

# [Dow futures surge 400 points as the market tries to recover from a brutal week](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/20/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose in early morning trading Tuesday following a brutal week as investors assessed a more aggressive Federal Reserve and rising chances of a recession.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 404 points, or 1.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 1.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures popped 1.4%. U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for Juneteenth.
*****
&gt; “There’s not a single reason for the bounce in equities, and the overwhelming view is dismissing the uptick as being nothing more than dead cat, something that should be faded just like all the other rally attempts lately. We push back a little bit on that view, largely because of an approaching inflation shift,” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; Crisafulli noted that Brent crude was trading roughly $10 below a recent high, while President Joe Biden gets set for a trip to Saudi Arabia to discuss energy production. He also pointed out that iron ore and copper have fallen recently.
*****
&gt; “If commodities can stay on a downward trajectory, it would remove a massive overhang from equity markets,” he said.
*****
&gt; Brent crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $115.75 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, gained 2.2% to $110.41 per barrel.
*****
&gt; Major tech stocks that have been pummeled in recent trading rose in the premarket. Shares of Apple, Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Meta all climbed more than 1%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Kellogg jumped more than 7% in premarket trading after the company said it would split into three separate companies. Separately, food company Mondelez increased 1.2% in premarket trading following news that it would acquire energy bar maker Clif Bar in a $2.9 billion transaction.
*****
&gt; Airline stocks soared in premarket trading amid hopes of a summer travel boom. Shares of Spirit Airlines jumped more than 9% in premarket trading after JetBlue raised its takeover offer to $33.50 a share, even as Spirit deliberates a proposed merger with Frontier Group. JetBlue’s stock price jumped 1.8% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note continued to march higher. Yields move inversely to prices.
*****
&gt; The major averages suffered their 10th losing week in 11 last week on fears that the central bank will hike rates aggressively to tame inflation at the risk of causing an economic downturn. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 5.8% last week for its biggest weekly loss since March 2020, dipping deeper into bear market territory. The equity benchmark is now more than 23% off its record high from early January.
*****
&gt; The blue-chip Dow slid 4.8% last week, falling below 30,000 for the first time since January 2021 last week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 4.8% last week, down 33% from its record high.
*****
&gt; “The recent drop in equity markets and inflection in investor attitudes make a bottoming thesis more difficult to make,” said Nationwide’s chief of investment research, Mark Hackett. “Investors are acting emotionally, but the fundamentals are beginning to follow the weakness in the technicals.”
*****
&gt; Fed Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Congress Wednesday and Thursday. His appearance comes after a recent rate hike by three-quarters of a percentage point, the central bank’s biggest increase since 1994.
*****
&gt; Investors will monitor incoming data, including existing home sales on Tuesday, to gauge the health of the economy. Recent data showing low consumer confidence, falling retail spending and a cooling housing market have fueled recession fears as the Fed battles inflation at 41-year highs.

personalfinance,Are these wise ways to use my 401ks to fulfill the downpayment on my home? (US),"Working out liquidating my assets so I can pay for a downpayment on my home. One thing I'm looking at is my 401k:

1. I have one ~~401k leftover~~ Rollover IRA from my previous employer, has like $2500 in it (Down from $3100 when it started). I know where are tax penalties for withdrawing it early and I've also heard there are exceptions for liquidating it to pay for something like a home purchase. I want to liquidate 100% of it and put it towards my downpayment. Would I be able to avoid the traditional fees from withdrawing early and get money back in tax breaks for capital losses come April of next year? (I also generally just don't like dealing with seperate 401ks so if this is an out I'd be happy to take it)

2. There's an option to take a loan out against my other 401k with my current employer with a 4.5% interest rate. Can probably pay it back within 1-2 months with my salary- is that something people normally do or is this type of thing for emergencies only?

Option 1: Continue to build 6 months emergency fund, then build home/baby fund. Leaving debt as is. 

Option 2: Build 3 months emergency fund, target debt then save for home/baby fund.

personalfinance,"Just got a new job, looking to buy a house and max out my IRA. How should I allocate my income to start?","Hey everyone, I’m a new college graduate who has relatively little debt (about 6k in a federal loan with a 5.05% interest rate, and about 12k from a no interest loan) and I’m getting married in May 2023. I’m currently living with my parents, and my fiancé is finishing up her degree in a different city so my expenses are pretty limited to gas and the occasional lunch. My new job is paying me 55k, and I received a signing bonus of 5k a week ago. I want to be able to max out my IRA this year, as well as save for a house for us to live in after we get married (looking at about 24-28k for down payment + closing costs). I’m thinking of putting 1k towards a Roth IRA each pay period for the next 2-3 months to max it out, then contribute heavily to our house fund after that, while paying a little over the minimum payment on my federal loan starting in September when the 0% interest period is scheduled to end. Anything you would change about this plan? Also, I’m looking for suggestions on investment platforms as well as high yield savings accounts. I’ve got about 2k dollars to allocate right this second (buying a ring is taking ~3k of the signing bonus), my paycheck should vary between 1800-2000 dollars over 24 pay periods (I think) and my expenses between checks really shouldn’t be more than 200-300 dollars. We aren’t getting a ton of help for the wedding and I need a little free for those costs, but other than that I want to invest or put away every other cent.

personalfinance,How long does it usually take for a debt collector to physically get an account off the credit report after agreeing to remove it?,"I negotiated last week for the collector of a medical bill to accept payment in return for removing it fully from my credit.  I paid them last Wednesday.  Is it unreasonable for me to be checking my credit every day to see when it comes off?  I'm just checking with Experian and Credit Karma so it doesn't cost me anything or hurt my credit to constantly look.  

I have been pursuing a mortgage, but now I rented an apartment to ""hold me over"" and I'm starting to think it would be fine to wait out the housing market a bit to see what happens to prices now that interest rates are up.  So a week ago I thought this was absolutely urgent and needed to be solved before I could apply for a mortgage which I felt I needed to get approved ASAP (because I'd be homeless if I couldn't buy a house - how else could people live?) but now I am thinking waiting a few weeks for this to come off won't be the end of the world; in fact maybe I should stay in this apartment for a while.  The rent is $850 which is just over half what I'd be spending on a mortgage in the neighborhood, albeit for a lot less space.  

I'm just wondering how long I should wait before I call them to follow up, or if I should just call them every couple days until it goes through.  The payment to them cleared on my side right away because I used a credit card.  Maybe it's normal for it to take a couple weeks or even a month?  What really puzzles me though is I haven't even gotten the letter from them yet, and that is a little concerning.",finance,1655823283
stocks,Here’s why Larry Summers wants 10 million people to lose their jobs,"Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says there needs to be a surge in unemployment to curb inflation, which Federal Reserve policy makers say doesn’t need to happen for price growth to cool off. According to Bloomberg News, Summers said in a speech on Monday from London that there needs to be a lasting period of higher unemployment to contain inflation — a one-year spike to 10%, two years of 7.5% unemployment or five years of 6% unemployment. Put a different way, Summers is calling for the unemployed rolls to swell to roughly 16 million from just under 6 million in May.

President Joe Biden said he spoke with Summers on Monday, with Biden — echoing his Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, the former Fed chief — maintaining that a U.S. recession can be avoided. The way Summers framed the numbers suggests he’s talking about what’s known as the Sacrifice Ratio, which is the link between unemployment and inflation.

According to Jason Furman, the former chair of President Obama’s Council of Economics Advisers, the Sacrifice Ratio in the 25 years before the pandemic has been six percentage points — meaning one year of a six-percentage-point jump in unemployment or two years of a three-percentage-point increase in the jobless rate would be required to knock down inflation by a full percentage point. 

In May, the unemployment rate was 3.6%. What Summers is basically saying is he wants the unemployment rate to rise to a level that would knock a full percentage point off inflation. The Fed-favored core PCE price index cooled to 4.9% on a year-over-year basis in April. 

Current Federal Reserve officials don’t accept that there needs to be such a stark trade-off. The Fed’s forecasts call for the unemployment rate to rise to 4.1% next year in a way that would cool core inflation to 2.3%. Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said the trade-off was less between inflation and unemployment than between inflation and job openings. 

Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, also said such a stark trade-off wasn’t needed. “Take for example in the labor market, so you have two job vacancies essentially for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level and you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’s consistent with 2% inflation,” Powell said at the last post-Fed-meeting press conference.

personalfinance,403b Rollover to Traditional IRA (Realizing Unrealized Loss)?,"Hello everyone.

I started my job last September, and they have a decent contribution plan (I contribute 2% gross pay, they contribute %10 of my gross pay). I've been taking advantage of it because, well free money, and there is no waiting period for vesting.

My contract ends in October, and I'll be going back to school for my Master's afterwards. I'm thinking about rolling over my 403b into a traditional IRA at SoFi (where I have my Roth IRA). Since I started investing at a relative high, and if the market continues to drop with the following series of Fed meetings, if/when I rollover would I be realizing my unrealized losses? It's not going to be thousands of dollars of losses to liquidate and buy new funds at SoFi (a few hundreds), but I still don't want to lose money ya know? 

I'll have to look at the fee schedule, if it's not bad, I'll keep it at my brokerage until conditions are better.

If you have any other suggestions please feel free to share.

Edit: maybe I should have been more careful with my vocabulary. I meant ""realizing"" unrealized Loss as in, I'll have to sell at a loss ***within a tax-advantaged account*** (403b) and then use the money to buy another asset ***within in a new tax-advantaged account*** (traditional IRA). This assumes that my two accounts don't share the same fund (they don't).",finance,1655823502
personalfinance,I regret past life choices and just want to talk somewhat anonymously about it,"Long story short, I didn't work towards a set career path and spent a good deal of money (\~$5k a year or more) on hobbies. Now, I feel like I'm somewhat behind in terms of finances compared to my peers. If that's the price I paid for enjoying the moment, then maybe the past 7 years is a pricy lesson learned that I'd ultimately prefer financial security over temporary enjoyment.

A bit about myself--

* 29 year old male, working in finance (7 years, since graduating with a BA in math)
* Live in a HCOL city
* Gross: $95k/year, there is an annual bonus but I haven't been at my current company long enough to find out how much I can expect
* Retirement savings: $75k (around May...so probably a good deal lower now). I contribute 10% before tax and company matches 3%
* Total savings: $8k
* Debt: $5k private student loan (4.9%), $15k federal student loan (usually 2.9% and 3.4%)
* Assets: bought a house a year ago w/ loaned funds from the parents ($80k for down payment, $120k for renovations)

I know that it's never too late to turn this franchise around, but it just feels a bit depressing that I'm hitting almost 30 and I don't feel financially secure at all (I know that sounds a bit bratty with the enormous intergenerational wealth transfer from my parents and I do realize I've had a lot of advantages in life, but still. I also will be paying them back eventually so it's still more of a generous loan than an outright transfer) I guess retirement savings is a bright spot, or at least on par with some of the benchmarking studies where they recommend around x1 of annual gross.

Sorry if this has been something of a rant or very similar to some of the other posts, but I think if these kind of posts are common I think it's indicative of how little conversation there is about income, savings, and financial health for young folks who by most accounts should be doing well but feel they aren't.",finance,1655824311

personalfinance,CC Balance Transfer Offer,"My bank has sent me a 0% balance transfer offer for one of my CC's. Its not actually 0% since there's a 4% fee but I'll pay no interest on the balance transfer until July/August 2023. If I took advantage of all the offers, excluding my 2 primary cards, I could take out a maximum of around $50k.

I'd probably take out a more modest amount of around $20k and since its a CC, I'll have to make a monthly minimum payment so I'd keep 5-10% of it aside just so I dont impact my current financial savings plans trying to make payments...

I dont exactly need the money as I'm already sitting on a fair amount of cash as I'm not at all confident in the market over the next 6-12 months but with Fed Interest rates on the rise, I dont know if/when I'll get a similar offer coming from the banks and obviously with inflation there is a degree of paying back the loan with money that has less buying power than when I took out the loan but again its not like I'm really locking in that buying power since I dont have a need of the cash to buy something now today...

I thought about maybe putting the money into my mortgage as a principal reduction payment. At 3.37%, it wont save me money this year but over the life of the loan it'll save me some $19k in interest but then again doing that would defeat the positive effects inflation has on debt for the debtor.

So should I just let it pass or is there a better way to leverage this balance transfer offer?

Note that while the idea here would be some sort of investment that I would have for the next 12-13 months (or less), I am in a financial position where I am not adverse to a position I would hold longer and repaying the card within the no interest period using ""opex"" as it were, assuming it was worthwhile and/or there was compelling reason to continue to hold on to that capital-asset.",finance,1655828610

We’re currently debating with the in-laws about what to do with the cash. They want us to pay off our principle on the logic that inflation isn’t hitting home values so our money is better off in a physical asset than as liquid (Elon Musk logic).

Conversely, given our interest rate, it seems to me that we’re better off keeping it as debt and letting the bank eat the inflation.

63. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss.

74. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
75. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

77. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources.

78. Reports are also coming in that the Biden Administration crypto plans due in August will target Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains over their “sky high” energy consumption.

88. Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill.

Here are the obvious buckets for the money.

Emergency fund
Repaying student loans
Giving to charity
Retirement
HSA
Increasing fun spending

I don't feel like I need to spend more on fun. I currently spend enough on fun stuff.

I'm almost at the max for HSA. Between me and my employer, $3400 is contributed. I could do the actual max, but that still leaves a fair amount.

My retirement seems good. Between me and my employer, I put in 15%, plus I do the max for a backdoor Roth. 

I am a little embarrassed by how little I give to charity. Maybe $300 per year. 

I have about 75k in student loans. Interest rates are all over the place. I could pay this down some. It won't make a huge dent, but maybe something's better than nothing. I don't have any other debts. 

My e-fund is, more or less, where I want it to be for now. Losing my job isn't a realistic possibility, but I thought you save up 10k for things like paying the deductible on a car for an accident, paying for car repairs, or other unexpected expenses. I've saved about 12k. I want to buy a house in 2 years, so maybe I could save more since one has higher unexpected costs as a homeowner.

Speaking of which, I guess I could also just drop more into my down payment fund, but I'm on track with that, and I'm in a 2 year lease and can't move any faster than planned.

Anyway, some idea what to do with the extra change would be appreciated.",finance,1655847210

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage or buy i-bonds?,"Hello. I currently have about $20k remaining on my mortgage for my residence. My mortgage rate is 4.75%. Calculated in dollars it is about $950 going to the bank per year if I pay the minimum monthly payments.

I could currently pay that off today. However, in the next 2-4 years I will be looking to buy a bigger house and may want to start thinking about growing my down payment now. 

I fully believe we are headed to a bear market and I do not believe many investments in the stock market will beat a 4.75% return within that time frame.

However, I see that [i-bonds are currently at 9.62%](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ibuy.htm#interest).

I came across some info where someone suggested to take that same $250 and instead of having it withheld for federal taxes, redirect the money to increasing our 401k/403b contributions, with the thought process being that if you increase your 401k/403b contribution, you get the double benefit of buffing out your retirement accounts as well as decreasing your taxable income.  Would I realize these benefits as stated?

bonds,Questions about buying bonds.,"I want to invest in bonds but at this time, I am not sure how. I am still trying to figure out how to purchase bonds outright, and I don’t quite understand the appeal of bond ETFs (aside from coupon payments, since you don’t personally hold the bond until maturity, the only value is that of the etf which fluctuates with interest rates). So to me this seems to defeat the purpose of a bond (get your money back, plus interest). Especially now as interest rates are rising the value of already issued bonds/bond ETFs will decrease. Am I understanding this correctly?

personalfinance,"Got myself in too deep of a loan, need help!","Hi everyone, my girlfriend and I, early 20s with an apartment and both having jobs, got a new car a few months back, the car is a 2020 Toyota Corolla SE and it costed about $20k but we rolled my old car loan on top of it and now owe \~$35,700 @ a 6% interest rate until Feb. 2028. It honestly feels overwhelming to the both of us. We both have always had the idea of early financial freedom in our minds, but these car payments are ridiculous at about $600 a month before insurance, gas, etc. It's nice that we haven't had to pay for maintenance yet (cross my fingers) but with the new job we got that pay us substantially more than the last, the car is taking a beating since we have to drive almost 30 miles there and back, so we're looking for better options. 

We've brainstormed maybe trying to trade the car to someone who already owns maybe another Corolla or fuel efficient car but the process seems a little complicated, so I thought about maybe doing some sort of trade, we could trade them our car for even just a pretty used up (lets say 2016 Corolla) and maybe $15-$10k which would bring our loan down to $25-$20k, but while that seems to work in my head, I feel like in practice it might end up more complicated than that... What if someone scams me? Can't I just do this at a dealership? Who would want my debt? etc.... etc.... so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

I just got a cash offer for $300k and I am considering selling and moving to an apartment or buying a better home.
I work from home in tech and my job pays well.

Reasons I’m considering selling:
Buy a better, newer home, with more modern layout
The home is old (70s) and feel like it won’t be good long term (30+ years)
Maybe buy in a better location / city
I’m married but don’t have kids, so we don’t “need” a home.

Reasons I’m considering not selling:
The mortgage is only $200k at 2.5% for 30 years. Low monthly payment
I make around $400k/yr so I can potentially pay it off in 2-3 years.
If I pay it off I’ll be closer to financial independence.
A new, better home will probably cost $600k for around the same sqft, which I won’t be able to payoff early, specially with rising interest rates.

Edit: 

Update
Thanks everybody for all your different perspectives and different options, they really helped.

My biggest take away I’ve realized is that my issue is mainly psychological. I noticed many people pointed that at my income level this decisions should be trivial, and I am now realizing it should be, but it isn’t for me because I still haven’t accepted I make this much. 6 years ago I was beyond broke at $6k/yr I could only afford a room for $300/month to live in cause even crappy apartments wouldn’t lease to me. Then I got my first corporate job and realized I was very good at IT. I got promotions fast and jumped companies and basically went from extreme poverty to my current income in 6 years. It feels surreal and I just don’t want to have to rent a room from a stranger ever again. I love having my own space more than anything, only if you’ve been on the edge of homelessness one can understand.

Because of my fear of falling back into poverty and the good advice here I think I’ll keep the home, keep saving and if I ever move I’ll just rent it, as that’ll give me peace of mind that if I ever fall from grace again, I’ll have a place to fall back, even though it’s very unlikely.

Thanks again for your inputs! I’ll try to respond to all of them",finance,1655853612

personalfinance,Part-time Summer Job &amp; Tax Forms,"I’m at rising sophomore in college (19M in VA-US) and just got my first summer part-time job at a small business for $15/hour @ 28 hours a week. Have a couple questions because I’ve never dealt with tax forms before. 

My first week working I got put onto my employer’s payroll and was given a W9 to fill out. I just got my first paycheck for $500 and realized no taxes were taken out. After some Googling and asking at home, I realized I’ve been put down as an independent contractor. 

I tried talking to my employer this weekend about mistakenly filling out a W9 instead of a W2 and wanted to switch to a W2. She took me aside and explained to me that she thought a 1099 would better suit me because I’d be able to take deductions out for transportation and meals for the short time I’m here (summer job so about 3 months). I said I’d like to reconsider and check in with her again, so now I’m here!

I’ve never filed taxes independently before and am usually claimed as a dependent under my parents. My concerns have to do with wanting to earning what I deserve and not messing up my first tax returns. 

My understanding is that with a W2, taxes will be taken out of each paystub but my federal taxes will be refunded if I file a tax return next year. Would I be able to file a return and also have my guardians claim me as a dependent? Definitely not going to be making over $12k, so I might not even have to file a tax return myself so would I be able to claim tax exempt on the W4? 

No taxes are taken out at all with a 1099 on each paystub, but I’ll definitely be making more than $600 so I’ll have to pay the self-employment tax next year. Will that be worth it even with the transportation and meal deductions? My boss said she thought a 1099 would be suitable for me, but I feel like it’s overcomplicating things.

Just trying to get my ducks in a row while also not trying to get fired because I really like the job. Really confused, but I just want to maximize my earnings to help my family with our debts. Thank you!",finance,1655857032

stocks,Market Outlook 6/22/2022,"Recap on yesterdays market action:

* SPY closed up 2.52%
* QQQ closed up 2.33%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed up 2.15%

Today was a good start to the market rally and recovery but we still have a lot of ground to cover before the bear market is truly shook. As for market news we still have the Fed Chair speaking Wednesday and Thursday and this may have an impact on the markets.

SPY broke back above the resistance trendline (support lines become resistance once they have been broken). Even though SPY broke above the line it did so on below average volume and started to fade into the close. If SPY can base above the trendline for a few days and then stage a rally that would be very productive.

QQQ never broke below its support trendline, however this does not mean that it is performing stronger than SPY. Today it was up on below average volume and also faded into the close, closing about halfway through the daily range. Similarly to SPY, if QQQ could base for a few days and then advance on volume that would start to signal a rally.

GOOGL triggered a buy today when it took out Wednesdays high with volume. I considered opening a small position but missed the alert and by the time I saw it GOOGL had advanced approximately 1% past the buy point. Even if I had opened a position I likely would have sold partial shares (20% of position) near the high and more shares (50% of remaining position) when GOOGL came back to my buy point. This market is very choppy and thus makes take partial profits quickly essential. As of now GOOGL needs to take out the June 10th high with volume to be considered a buy.

TSLA is acting slightly stronger that GOOGL at the moment. Also advancing past Wednesdays high with volume although we did see a fade into the close. Similarly to GOOGL I had planned to buy taking out the highs but missed the alerts (I was occupied with a meeting). TSLA did form a downward sloping trendline that may provide an entry if it is taken out with volume and a good market.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, todays price action was constructive but no enough to become extremely bullish. This is simply one step on the long road to a health market. The indices may setup up for an entry but profits need to be taken quick and losses even quicker. As for individual stocks that show high probability setups they are few and far in between. My true favorites are currently only GOOGL and TSLA, more may soon be added to this list. Stay focused and watch your stocks because the market has the ability to turn quickly.",finance,1655858014

Being that I can't afford such a cost myself (and not many can), I applied to FAFSA and received two loan offers. One is a federal direct unsubsidized loan that offers a bit more than 20k, and the other is a federal direct grad PLUS loan that provides me with about 40k. I've done some research on each loan and know that one entails paying the interest accrued per month and the other requires repayments starting 6 months after I graduate. Since even added together neither would completely cover my school costs and I don't think it wise to have to juggle 2 different loans I want to go with one, but am unsure which one.

His credit score is low, so without him, I would be looking at 5.5% interest rate if I buy 2 points for around $8k at closing (plus put down 15%).

However, with the second option, we’re also getting $17,500 at settlement in closing costs credits from the bank. 

I am wondering which option would be most recommended? Also, if we plan to refinance in the next few years once the rates drop, does it make sense to buy points? Without buying them, we’re looking at 6.5% interest with the second option and around 5.7 or 5.8 with the first option.

personalfinance,Advice on picking a new credit card?,"I'm looking to apply for another credit card in the hopes of getting some worthwhile perks like 0% APR and/or cashback which none of my current cards offer. I'm also hoping one of the larger companies will give me a higher credit limit than the ones I have now. I learned through my comments on a similar post that my low credit limits are unusual, and likely due to the fact all of my credit cards are with Credit Unions and not major companies.

I'm just looking for a little advice as to what companies have been the best in your experience, and which of these cards seem like they're the best deal.  I will be using the card to pay my monthly bills, take advantage of the 0%APR to pay for some household repairs/upgrades, and will likely pay it off in full every month after that.

I am 28

I  am single

I make \~$134,000 a year

I own my home and an investment property

I have one late payment on a credit card from 2018 that was an accident, my credit is spotless other than that

I currently have 4 credit cards with $1000-2000 limits

My oldest card has been open for a decade, 2 are 9 years old, and the newest one is 1.5 years

All of my cards have a 0 balance since I paid them off in August of last year

I have had many car loans, mortgages, and other accounts, so my credit history is well established

Apple card- preapproved for 10k, interest rate was 13.99%. 1-3% unlimited cash back 11.74-22.74% APR

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Appraisal Disappointment,"We were initially estimated to get $100k cash from a mortgage refinance loan before the appraisal. This money was intended to help pay for repairs to our home like replacing the patio. 

The appraisal came back with us getting $75k cash AFTER we fix the patio ourselves. Monthly payments go up +$800 with 4.25% interest rate. We are using a VA loan which has strict guidelines with appraisals. 

We are wondering if this is still a viable option. There are other repairs needed and we have limited savings. We can probably demolish the patio and install a staircase but that will cost us too.

What other options are there for getting a loan for home repairs?",finance,1655864158
personalfinance,Maxing I bonds per parent (and child?),"The US Treasury has 5-year I bonds for sale with a current interest rate of 9.62%. I suspect this will have a much higher return than our index funds, so I'm diverting our monthly surplus there, for now.

The maximum one can contribute is $10k per person, but I've heard you can add an additional $10k by ""gifting"" it yourself, the only drawback being that you cannot touch it for 1 year which we plan not to anyway. My wife and I are both interested in maxing this out. I can't find a way to do this on their website--has anyone had any experience with gifting I bonds? Is there a way to buy these bonds for our 6 year old? What's the maximum we can buy for her?",finance,1655864740
personalfinance,Can someone explain loan interest to me?,"Here is what I mean: I currently owe $13,000 on a personal loan that I used to consolidate a bunch of credit card debt on. My interest rate is 15.99%, which is less than my credit cards but it's still a lot. My monthly payments are:

$362.99, of which $179.02 goes towards the principal and $183.97 goes towards interest. Obviously, it's the interest that's killing me. 

So my question is, does that monthly interest I pay change based on how much I owe? If I were to pay $5000 right now and lower my loan to $8,000, would I still be paying $183.97 in interest until it's paid off, or would I pay less interest since the amount I owe is less?

personalfinance,How much house can we actually afford?,"My husband and I are looking to purchase our first home, and honestly with as crazy as the housing market is right now, we're really unsure of how much we can actually afford to spend on a house.  For some rough numbers our joint income before taxes is about 100k and we have 50k in savings with about 20k in an investment account....we were thinking of putting 50k for the down payment so we're not totally wiped out.  We've got a preliminary approval for a 450k mortgage (to me this seems rather high......doubt we could actually afford the payments on something like that).  We've used a bunch of those online calculators that you punch in your down payment, the total cost, and interest rate to get a monthly payment amount but honestly with houses selling for way over asking price and appraisal price, I feel like those tools only give you a best case scenario.  I also know that how much the house appraises for makes a difference with how much cash you need upfront.  Basically I'm looking for advice, anecdotes, or if anyone knows of some good resources online I can use to educate myself about figuring out a price range we can afford.

My problem is that he hasn’t pooped since yesterday morning (before i took him to the vet he pooped!) could it be because of the worms? Or maybe the medication? He hasn’t been eating as much but yesterday night we fed him and he pretty much finished the food .. i took him outside and he peed, but no sign of having to poop!

personalfinance,Looking for some advice on selling vs renting our house that we own.,"We bought our house in cash for $245k in 2018 and can probably sell for double. What would you all do?

So, my fiancé and I both live super far from our jobs. I live 50 miles away (I WFH, but would at least like the option to go in if I wanted) and he works 30 miles from his job and commutes everyday and uses the dreaded TEXAS toll roads that cost a million dollars a day. 

Anyways, we hate our neighbors, hate our town, hate our commute, etc. 

We makes ~75k/yr and I make ~65+/yr. He has a loan for our new AC unit and owes like $3000, $116/month. I lease my car for $479/month and have a mattress payment for $145/month. Other than that, we have no debt. 

So we were wondering what the best option here is. I personally think we should sell and downsize (our house is 3000sq ft). Then invest the difference. 

He thinks we should keep this house and rent it out and then buy another house and have a mortgage. I absolutely do not like that idea. The interest rates are much higher, home prices are peaking. It just seems stupid to me.

personalfinance,"Bought our first house at 18&amp;20, made money and now don't know what to do!","Hello,

My husband (21) and I (23) have a decent amount of money, and have no idea what to do with it!

As of today we have 30k in savings/no debt, 152k in equity of our house/185k mortgage balance, 35k in car assets/no debt, and about 50k in other other personal items. We bought our house in 2019, when he was 18 and I was 20 for 215k, and paid about 30k with down payment and closing costs in an above average neighborhood in a midwest city. We fully furnished our house at the time and spent about 35k and getting everything for it and now live a pretty comfortable life and have no idea what do from here.

Both of us go to community college have full scholarships, and work entry-level jobs part-time him as a server, and me as a customer service representative making combined about 30k a year. We have both been working since 15, and managed to buy our house by saving up from early on after getting married when he turned 18 and I was 20. We have tried to make smart financial decisions by not getting into any debt, never missing payments, keeping credit scores both over 800+, and overall just being very cautious about where we spend; however, I cannot help but feel like we aren't doing enough to grow our savings since they are just in a regular savings account making less than 0.05% interest and not necessarily growing due to our part-time jobs while going to school.

We don't know what to do! Because are juggling both work and school, we aren't able to go full-time with work and feel like we won't be done until our mid 20's with school to increase our income potential at better jobs. At the same time I know our savings are loosing money to inflation, and don't know if we should be investing in 401ks, rothIRA's, crypto, stock market etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Income:

\+ 2,500 monthly income both of us est./30k a year

\+ 600 monthly renting out a room

$3,100 MONTHLY IN

&amp;#x200B;

Monthy Expenses:

\- $1,330 mortgage (30 year conventional 3.88 interest rate, includes property taxes, home owners insurance, and PMI)

\- $235 natural gas, electricity, water, trash

\- $60 internet

\- $190 phones (service &amp; financing plan)

\- $550 groceries

\- $175 car insurance

\-$25 gym membership

\-$60 subscriptions

$225 gas for cars

$2,850 MONTHLY OUT

&amp;#x200B;

That leaves us with $250 balance that goes to the the variable expenses and just regular house maintenance stuff.

What should we do?! Though everything from dropping out of school to work full-time, sell our house and cash out on the equity before market crashes, doing what we are doing and investing the 30k into stock etc.

63. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss.

74. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
75. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network.

77. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources.

88. Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill.

cardano,Proof-of-Stake is the appropriate consensus for the financial revolution,"Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) are two different concepts performing the same task. Both approaches have their undeniable advantages and disadvantages. Unfortunately, arguments against PoS often stem from misunderstanding or overlooking the problems of PoW. Let’s make the case for PoS in this article.

### Distribution of power

It is not technologically possible for all actors in a public network to have equal status. In the case of both Cardano and Bitcoin, the pool operators have the greatest responsibility as they produce the blocks. Thus, they can decide, for example, what transactions to include in a block, or which block to build on in the case of a fork. If regulators want to force censorship of transactions, they need only focus on the pool operators. The larger the number of pools from different countries that exist in the network, the more resistant the network will be to regulatory pressures.

The next group is made up of entities that delegate power to pool operators. In the case of PoW networks like Bitcoin, miners delegate the hash rate to the chosen pool. Similarly, in the case of PoS networks like Cardano, stakers delegate coins to the chosen pool. In principle, this is the same process. Delegators trust that the chosen pool operator will behave honestly. If not, they delegate power to another pool. It is healthy if there are multiple pool operators in the network and it is economically feasible to start a new pool.

Pool operators may have their own share of decision-making power (their own hash rate or coins), but mostly they depend on delegators. In the event of an attack, it is the delegators who can avert the attack or enforce the desired behavior of the pool operators through delegation of power. For example, if regulators forced a major pool to censor transactions, delegators would start supporting another pool. Again, the more power is distributed among the delegators, the more resilient the network will be to attacks. As the distribution of power grows, so does democratic decision-making.

Bitcoin didn’t have pools in the beginning. Anyone could mine a block on their laptop and get a reward. The decentralization of Bitcoin was at a maximum level, as users had roughly equal status. This changed with the advent of ASIC miners and the emergence of pools. Users had to acquire expensive hardware to make it worthwhile to mine BTC coins. With the advent of pools, there was a small group of entities that could produce a block. Network security improved significantly, but decentralization began to decline significantly.

Block production today is dominated by approximately 9 major pools. One of the major players is the Binance exchange. Note that if Foundry USA Pool, Binance, and AntPool were to agree to work together, they have a combined hash rate of over 51%. Delegators could delegate the hash rate elsewhere if it would be convenient for the network. The question is how quickly they would respond to a potential problem.

Bitcoin mining has become a business. Entrepreneurs are buying up tens of thousands of ASIC miners and putting them in big mining halls. Big players can negotiate significant discounts with hardware and power suppliers. They can even negotiate better terms with pool operators. Energy is differently expensive in different parts of the world, so mining will always be geographically concentrated in places where conditions are better. For a long time, China has dominated mining. If there were significantly better conditions for mining in a given region, there would be a concentration again. Domestic hobby miners have no chance to compete. Especially in areas where energy is expensive or scarce. Mining bitcoins is an exclusive affair available only to the rich and only in certain parts of the world.

The current state of Bitcoin decentralization and security is described in a [scientific study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29396/w29396.pdf) made by Cambridge experts in 2021. Let us quote one paragraph.

&gt;We show that the Bitcoin mining capacity is highly concentrated and has been for the last five years. The top **10% of miners control 90%** and just **0.1% (about 50 miners) control close to 50%** of mining capacity. Furthermore, this concentration of mining capacity is counter cyclical and varies with the Bitcoin price. It decreases following sharp increases in the Bitcoin price and increases in periods when the price drops or. Thus, the **risk of a 51% attack increases in times when the Bitcoin price drops** precipitously or following the halving events.

As you can see, according to the study, the long-term trend is very negative in terms of decentralization. The study also looks at security, but we will come to that later. Let’s now take a look at how decentralized the Cardano PoS network is and why this is so.

Decentralization and security of PoS networks are growing along with the distribution of native coins. This is an advantage, as key parameters grow with higher adoption, i.e. with higher social and financial importance of the network. In the Cardano network, every ADA coin holder can be a delegator at the same time. Staking can be seen as a kind of analogy to bitcoin mining. In Bitcoin, BTC holders have no decision rights and cannot participate in the network consensus. With PoS networks, literally, any coin user can make decisions. Let us add that not only at the level of the network consensus but also in some form of decentralized governance.

Coin holders always have the greatest interest in network security and decentralization. This is the largest group that buys coins with their money. Due to the demand for coins, the value of coins increases, which affects security because coins also serve as a reward for pool operators and delegators. In PoW networks, delegators are only business people who do not need to hold the coins. They only care about profit. In PoS networks, the coin holders are also the decision-makers, which makes more sense.

From our point of view, it doesn’t make sense that those who have the biggest skin in the game, i.e. the coin owners, have no decision-making rights. BTC holders must trust the miners to act in their interest. But miners will always prefer their own economic interests. Let’s add that most coin holders won’t run a full node, so they have no influence on the consensus even in terms of client choice.

If you want to have decision-making power in a POS network, you just need to hold coins and have a lightweight wallet. You could say that the owners of the coins are also the owners of the network.

Staking is significantly more inclusive, as anyone in the world can buy coins for the same value. There is no need to purchase expensive hardware when users want to begin with staking. Staking is not a risky business, so more people are more likely to want to participate. Cardano has no minimum required amount of coins for staking. Users literally only need a few coins.

For both PoW and PoS, everyone would like to provide a passive income. Staking, however, is significantly more accessible to everyday people. Selfish economic interests increase the decentralization and security of PoS networks. For PoW networks, only security increases at the expense of decentralization. To be more precise, anyone in the world can try to participate in PoW mining. Individual entrepreneurs compete with each other, however, their numbers are decreasing over time as only the best ones can succeed.

In other words, success in POW mining depends on many external factors, whereas in the case of PoS, the purchase of coins is sufficient to allow a holder of coins to participate in staking for a long period of time and receive rewards regularly.

 

If you look at the number of pools in the Cardano network, you will see a large number of smaller players. Of course, there are whales in the Cardano network as well. However, the advantage of PoS networks is that the protocol is aware of its own decentralization and can economically incentivize its growth. Theoretically, maximum rewards in an epoch can only be achieved if there are a certain desired number of saturated pools. Let’s add that there are more than 1.1 million delegators in the network and the number is on the rise.

The quality of decentralization is not only about network consensus, but also about the underlying infrastructure. Trail of Bits, commissioned by DARPA, has released a [report](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd11235b3950c2c1a3b6df4/62af6c641a672b3329b9a480_Unintended_Centralities_in_Distributed_Ledgers.pdf) evaluating the decentralization of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Let me quote one sentence from the report:

&gt;Bitcoin’s Nakamoto coefficient is **four**, because taking control of the four largest mining pools would provide a hashrate sufficient to execute a 51% attack.

This is essentially a very similar finding to the study cited above.

You will also learn from the report that Bitcoin protocol traffic is unencrypted and 60% of the network traffic traverses only three ISPs. This might poses a critical vulnerability because ISPs and hosting providers have the ability to arbitrarily degrade or deny service to any node.

Another finding is that Bitcoin’s mining pool protocol Stratum is unencrypted and essentially unauthenticated. Malicious attacks can be made to estimate the hash rate and payouts of a miner in the pool and manipulate Stratum messages to steal CPU cycles and payouts from mining pool participants.

People sometimes focus too much on the network consensus and forget that decentralization also depends on the network layer. In the case of Bitcoin, this layer is outdated and vulnerable.

### Direct and indirect delegation of power

PoS is criticized for people being staking on centralized exchanges. That’s a legitimate criticism, but if you look at the image above, you’ll see that Binance has an 11% share. That’s a smaller share than Bitcoin mining, where Binance has a 14% share.

Staking on exchanges means that people entrust coins to a third party who decides what pool they delegate to. Exchanges can then create their own pools and use the coins of users for delegation. The exchanges can misuse the coins for an attack, or the coins can be stolen by an attacker who then uses the coins for an attack. As you can see, Binance’s share is not significant and will likely trend downward over time. People will trust centralized solutions less and less and decentralized solutions will appear on the market. In addition, the number of major players will also grow. At the moment, this is not a major risk. The community is working to ensure that people are educated about the risks related to centralized exchanges and stakes from their own wallets.

In general, the delegation of power can be divided into direct and indirect. Direct delegation means that the owner of the coins or hash rate, i.e. the one who paid for them, directly chooses the pool to which he delegates and can change his choice at any time. Indirect delegation means that the user entrusts the coins or hash rate to a third party, which promises a reward and decides itself to whom it delegates the power. Thus, delegators do not have the choice entirely in their control.

It is important to mention that Bitcoin has exactly the same problem with indirect hash rate delegation as PoS networks with staking on exchanges. People can buy computing power from third parties who run PoW mining for their money. It’s called cloud mining. If the price of energy is expensive in Europe, for example, and people still want to make money from mining, they can buy hash rates or rent ASIC miners from a third party in America. Payments are made through bank accounts. Everything is done remotely. 

The problem is the same as with staking, as the third party can reserve the right to what pool to delegate to. Even if the user is allowed to choose a pool, he can hardly check that the third party has delegated the hash rate to the chosen pool. Users pay without controlling the use of the hash rate. The possibility of misusing the hash rate for an attack is similar to that of misusing coins. The third-party risks essentially nothing, since many people can pay for the energy upfront. 

Large third parties always have the disadvantage of being easy to attack. An attacker can temporarily cut off the hash rate at the time of the attack or redirect it to where it needs to go.

In PoS networks, the problem can be solved through user education or legislation (centralized exchanges can be banned from staking). For PoW networks, it is much more complicated, as PoW mining is exclusive by principle and those who want to participate have to essentially trust the third party. There is no other choice. 

On the [Genesis Mining](https://www.genesis-mining.com/) website, you can find information that over 2 million people use its services. Moreover, there are more similar players. These third parties have a significant contribution to the overall hash rate for bitcoin mining.

### Resources and security

The distribution of decision-making power is dependent on a particular resource. Power consumption is important for PoW mining. Electricity is an expensive and infinite resource that is not scarce. Electricity can be bought with money, which in the context of bitcoin mining can be seen as a kind of investment in order to make a profit. The resource must be consumed, for which a reward is earned. The cost of mining is covered by the reward and ideally, the participants will profit. Mining is a risky business and may not be profitable.

Coins in PoS projects are an expensive and finite resource. The resource itself is therefore scarce. Coins are not consumed in staking. The reward is always guaranteed by the protocol for honest behavior. 

As we wrote above, rewards will increasingly depend on the collection of fees. Let’s take a look at the biggest differences between PoW and PoS.

Bitcoin provides its security through brute force. If someone wants to attack Bitcoin, or rewrite history, they must unconditionally consume a given amount of electricity. There is no other option.

PoS networks like Cardano base their security on decentralization, i.e., the distribution of ADA coins. The greater the distribution of decision-making power, the more difficult it is to attack the network. It is necessary to attack a large number of independent entities that make decisions for themselves, including securing their pools and coins. Individual actors must protect their private keys well. However, this is consistent with industry-wide efforts and people are used to using hardware wallets. For pool operators, this is a necessity.

Energy consumption performs two tasks in PoW networks. Firstly, it is a form of lottery to help decide who gets the right to create a new block in the given time period. In the second place, it is a security against history overwriting.

Cardano’s PoS is built on the same principles as Bitcoin and it is based on the Nakamoto Consensus. The fundamental difference is that modern cryptography is used instead of energy consumption ([Key Evolving Signature](https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/011.pdf), [Verifiable Random Function](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Pseudo%20Randomness/Verifiable_Random_Functions.pdf)). Cryptography is used for a lottery, i.e. to determine who gets the right to produce the next block. The fundamental difference is basically just the amount of energy consumed. The difference is considerable. While Bitcoin needs about the same amount of electricity as a European country, Cardano needs about the same amount as a hotel. As for protecting against history overwriting, it would be necessary to break the cryptographic keys, which would be a more computationally expensive process than trying to get a higher hash rate for a multi-day PoW attack.

The security of PoW networks is directly dependent on the price of coins at the time of the attack. In a bear market, there is a greater chance of an attack taking place. Let’s calculate the overnight cost of a 51% attack on Bitcoin, neglecting transaction fees and the price of hardware. Transaction fees are not a significant component of the budget, especially in bear markets. Suppose an attacker had been planning an attack for a long time, so he would have been buying up older hardware from miners who capitulated and went out of business during the bear market. Theoretically, he could get older hardware. With BTC coins worth $20,000, a one-day attack would cost roughly $18,000,000.

If the attacker succeeds in the PoW attack, he also receives the block reward for the longest chain, so the cost of the attack is essentially recovered when it comes to energy. The cost of the attack is only associated with the hardware.

The attack on the PoS network is also dependent on the value of the coins. However, the attacker does not buy an external infinite resource at a given price (like energy). The attacker must buy directly the project’s native coins in the required amount. For example, about 51% of the ADA coins in the case of the Cardano network. At the time of writing, the value of ADA coins is $0.50, so an attack would cost at least $6,000,000,000. An attack on Cardano would be about 333 times more expensive than an attack on Bitcoin.

However, this is only the theoretical cost of an attack. Since the security of PoS networks is more related to decentralization, an attacker would have to somehow arrange for people to sell him coins. Once there is a high demand for coins on the open market, the value would also rise. This would motivate people to buy the coins for staking purposes. The cost of the attack would get steadily more expensive. It is difficult to estimate whether it is possible for one entity to buy such a large amount of coins. The higher demand to buy coins the less likely is the attack. Again, it is not only about the value of coins. The distribution also helps prevent attacks. As network adoption, i.e. the distribution of ADA coins, continues to increase, the chances of an attack will decrease. Moreover, whales may not be willing to sell their coins. As long as there are honest whales in the network, an attack is basically impossible.

It is relatively difficult to quantify how much better PoW is than PoS, or vice versa, in terms of resilience against a 51% attack. Both concepts are doing very well. In both cases, the attacker is attacking his own wealth. If someone owns 1% of the PoS network’s native coins, they basically have enough to live comfortably, including their family. This is not the case with BTC coins.

### Security budget

The security of the Bitcoin protocols is directly linked to the value of BTC coins. If the value of BTC coins increases, security also increases. Unfortunately, the reverse is also true. This means that for every additional halving that occurs every 4 years, the value of BTC coins must also increase at least 2-fold to keep at least the current level of the security budget. However, as we explained above, the desired property is that security scales with adoption. 

During the last bull run, BTC value rose approximately 3.3-fold and has now fallen below the ATH of the previous bull run. This basically means that if Bitcoin is to surpass the last ATH, the multiplication must be higher than the last time. It is definitely possible. However, with higher capitalization, it will be more difficult to do multiples of the coin’s value.

The cost of a one-day attack can be calculated by taking the number of rewards per day and multiplying it by the current BTC value and the block reward size. If the value of BTC in 2032 is, say, $500,000, the calculation would look like this: 

&gt;144 \* 500,000 \* 0.78 = 56,160,000

If transaction fees are neglected, the security budget in 2032 could be roughly $56 million, assuming the value of BTC reaches this projected value.

PoW is very good protection against an external 51% attack, but only until there is a sufficient budget. This seems to be a problem as no one can predict the value of BTC coins in the future. Let’s not forget that the value of bitcoins can drop by 80% after reaching the ATH in a four-year cycle, so security will also drop by the same amount. So it is fair to say that Bitcoin might not be economically sustainable in the long run.

An interesting work on the topic of [security budget](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/) comes from Paul Sztorc. In the article, you will find the following table that illustrates the declining block reward and the projected value of BTC. Paul predicts that after 2032, the security budget will start to decrease.

 In our view, there is no point in speculating on market developments in the long run. It is clear that PoW security may have serious problems after say 20–30 years.

PoS networks may be significantly better off because the security budget is not so dependent only on the value of the coins, but also on their distribution. The attacker needs to have more than half of the coins that are staked. One can expect that if Cardano has a significant social and financial role in the future, the value of ADA coins will increase at least 10x, maybe 20x over the next 10–20 years. If the value of ADA coins got to, say, $10, the minimum cost of an attack would be roughly $125,000,000,000. This seems sufficient from a network security perspective. 

The cost of running the PoS network will always be similar, more or less to the cost of running a hotel. It is realistic to expect to collect enough transaction fees to remunerate pool operators and delegators.

Let’s do one quick and hypothetical calculation. If any network processed 1,000 transactions per second at a cost of $0.20, it would earn $17,280,000 each day. In the case of the PoS network, a stakeholder with a 0.001% share would earn $172 per day. For a regular PoS network, this would be a sufficient reward to motivate users to hold the coins. PoS networks can hypothetically be economically sustainable only from the fees collected. We have neglected network operation costs, but these are minimal in PoS networks.

In the case of PoW networks, the situation is not so good, as a similar income of the network would not provide sufficient network security. What is even worse, a significant part of the income is used by miners to cover energy costs. The profit to the miners would therefore be relatively small. Let’s not forget that the cost of hardware and paying taxes are also expenses that miners have to take into account.

Once the network subsidy starts to decrease significantly, which will be sometime after 2044 when the block reward will be 0.09 BTC, the Bitcoin network will have to collect tens, but better hundreds of millions of USD in fees. If the scalability of the first layer does not improve, users would have to pay fees in the hundreds of USD. 

Of course, if the value of BTC coins were in the tens of millions of USD, the network would not be so dependent on fees.

Predicting the income from the fees collected is also quite problematic, as development is dependent on technological advances, adoption, and people’s willingness to pay expensive fees at the first layers. Regular market principles will always work and if there is a cheaper alternative, people will use it. It is likely that people will use second layers and other cheaper solutions to transfer value, so these solutions will collect transaction fees at the expense of the first layers.

### Different attacks on the network 

Decentralized networks should ideally have no single point of failure. The reality is that blockchain networks have significant actors. These are mainly pool operators and a group of delegators.

It is relatively easy to physically attack important points in PoW networks because mining takes place in large mining halls that are easy to trace. In the past, hash rates have dropped due to flooding in China. If a country decides to ban mining, it takes a long time to transport ASIC miners somehow elsewhere.

PoS networks are much more resilient to physical attacks, as they depend essentially only on the Internet and electricity. Millions of people around the world can delegate power to a chosen pool through the wallet. If a country outlaws staking or operating a pool, the coins can be transferred in minutes and business can be set up on the other side of the world relatively quickly.

ASIC miners can be easily confiscated and then used for attack or destroyed. It is more difficult with coins since delegators are more distributed all around the world. So, it is worse to find them and enforce the law.

If the hash rate drops unexpectedly and cannot be delivered quickly, block production slows down. This can quickly clog the network with new transactions. If this happens at the beginning of a difficulty-adjustment cycle, it can take a relatively long time before the network is usable again.

PoS networks have nothing like difficulty adjustment. At regular short intervals, different pools are given the right to produce the next block. They either take the chance and get rewarded, or they don’t. If a pool fails to produce a block in a given slot, this is not a problem, as another pool will soon get the chance.

Bitcoin’s dependence on hardware and electricity is seen as an advantage because of its anchoring in the physical world. However, it has obvious drawbacks as well. If a vendor created a new technology that was significantly more efficient than competing solutions and decided not to sell their device and instead use it themselves, they would essentially centralize mining. Over time, such a player would completely control the network.

Something similar can happen with energy. If a state wanted to control mining and thus essentially control the voting process, all it would have to do is subsidize energy or build a new source. More states could do something similar. Trouble is, entrepreneurs would be at a disadvantage and retail would have no chance to participate in mining at all. The network would essentially be controlled by a few states.

Participation in decentralization must be as inclusive as possible, as the desire to control the network grows together with its importance. Today, the business has essentially driven retail out of the system. In time, Bitcoin may be controlled by a few top businessmen, or by a few states. There’s no one in my area who mines bitcoin. A few people mine Ethereum. However, I know dozens of people who stake ADA. That’s the reality today.

To build the decentralization of the PoS network and the decision-making process on the distribution of coins seems a better design. Still, states can try to buy large amounts of coins and gain dominance. Once a few big players have a significant dominance, people would lose confidence and migrate to another network. Trying to gain dominance and abuse their position doesn’t make much sense from the side of the big players.

It can be said that both PoW and PoS networks can be controlled by a few entities that have a large budget. From this point of view, we see no difference between the two consensus protocols.

Decentralized networks should be resilient not only to external attacks but also to internal attacks. That is, to attacks from pool operators and large delegators. Assuming a large enough security budget, PoW networks are well resilient to external attacks. According to the study cited above, about 50 miners control 50% of the hash rate. This means that if these 50 miners cooperate, they could collectively compromise the network. Although 50 actors is still a relatively large number, this number may decrease over time. The risk of abuse of power increases.

PoS networks are more likely to be resilient not only to external attacks but also to internal ones, assuming the distribution of coins grows. PoS networks are younger, so we will have to wait a few years before we can draw firm conclusions. 

Whales will always be present in any system where power can be gained through money. It is realistic to imagine that teams along with the community will be forced to come up with new rules in order to increase decentralization.

It’s interesting to see how people behave during big drops in the value of coins. PoW miners need to sell coins regularly to stay profitable. When the value of coins drops steeply, miners are forced to sell coins quickly to be able to cover their energy costs. However, this causes the value of the coins to fall further. It causes panic in the market and a massive sell-off. Alternatively, miners can temporarily shut down ASIC miners and wait to see how the situation develops. Both of these can reduce the security of Bitcoin. The reduction in the value of BTC coins will mainly affect owners.

For PoS networks, the drop in coin value does not have such a dramatic impact on security. During the recent drop of BTC value below the level of $20K, the number of people who staked ADA coins did not drop. Staking carries no direct risk of losing money, other than a drop in the value of ADA coins. People are more willing to resist a short-term drop in price because if they believe in a return in the value of ADA coins, they have no reason to stop staking. They essentially continue to protect the network against a 51% attack. Independence from electricity seems to be an advantage in this case.

If there were a large number of ASIC miners in the market and the miner’s reward budget was declining over time, miners would be motivated to mine coins from another newer project. Miners are essentially mercenaries who want a reward for their work and will go where the reward is higher. Younger projects might have higher rewards, so miners can easily move elsewhere. It could be that a younger PoW project will have a higher hash rate than Bitcoin. Of course, it depends on the demand for coins of the competing project, however, at the same time to some extent this scenario depends on the value of BTC coins.

We can imagine that the world will face an energy crisis due to the transition to green energy sources and there will be increased pressure for reasonable consumption. Governments may not like PoW mining and may be inclined to drive miners out of the country, as China has done. The reasons can only be environmental. This will weaken the hash rate at least in the short term. PoS networks do not have this problem.

There are many other attack vectors that we have not described. However, it turns out that PoW networks do not have any extra advantage over PoS networks, and the dependency on energy consumption seems to be more of a disadvantage. If already running PoS networks like Cardano, Algorand, Polkadot remain secure for the next few years and nobody manages to break their protection, it will be obvious that PoW is not necessary.

### Rich gets richer

A popular argument, which Lyn also describes, is that in a PoS network the rich get richer. This argument appears to us to be false. Lyn wrote:

*With a proof-of-stake system, the more coins you have, the more voting power you have, and those with the coins are also the ones earning the new coins from staking. Since they don’t need to expend resources to stake, they can simply increase their overall staking amount as they earn ongoing coins from staking rewards, and exponentially grow their influence on the network over time, forever. Network dominance tends to lead to more network dominance, in other words.*

The argument “*the more coins you have, the more voting power you have*” can be rewritten as “*the more hash rate you have, the more voting power you have*”. It holds true in both PoS and PoW cases. 

When it comes to profit, the one with the bigger business always earns more. If you run 10-fold more ASIC miners, you will make 10-fold more profit than the one who runs a single ASIC miner. 

Cardano rewards delegators proportionally. If you hold 100 ADA coins, you will receive an average of 5.4 ADA coins per year. If you hold 100,000 ADA coins, you get 5,433 ADA coins. So if you hold 1,000 times more coins, your reward is 1,000 times higher. Your skin in the game is higher, so it’s fair that you have more voting power.

What really matters is how quickly you can leverage the reward to gain more influence over network decision-making and the reward at the same time. Cardano is fairer than Bitcoin, as each new ADA coin is automatically counted towards your stake and boosts it. This is not the case with PoW. In order to increase your hash rate share in the network, you need to be able to buy a new ASIC miner from the gained rewards. So you have to collect the rewards for a longer period of time before you are able to buy a new ASIC miner. As a home hobby miner, you can wait as long as a year. A big businessman earns enough every day to buy a new ASIC miner so he can expand the business faster than the hobby miner. 

In the case of PoW networks, it holds true that the rich get richer faster. For PoS networks, this problem is significantly less dramatic.

The IOG team published the first research about [Cryptocurrency Egalitarianism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02434.pdf) and we recommend you to read it.

### Commodity vs. Equity

Lyn and others believe that BTC coins are a commodity while PoS network coins are equity. BTC is considered gold, while ADA coins as Cardano network equities. We don’t think it is reasonable to try to describe cryptocurrencies with old economic labels. However, let’s take a look at it.

Many mining companies mine gold and the goldsmith turns it into gold bullion that you can buy. This bullion is not dependent on the mining company. They can go bankrupt and the gold bullion will still be worth the same. There is no link between gold and mining companies. Gold mining and gold ownership are completely separate from each other. Gold mining may not take place at all unless it is economically viable.

In the case of cryptocurrencies, the existence of coins is directly dependent on the network and its ability to create new blocks. Without the network, the coins would not be liquid. Thus, the owner of the coins is mainly dependent on the economic model, security, and decentralization of the network. If cryptocurrency holders want to protect their wealth, they must continue to monitor the state of the network, understand the underlying mechanisms, and sell coins in a timely manner if there is any danger. There is a direct link between the existence of a network and the possession of coins.

Is it advantageous to separate PoW mining from BTC coin owners, or is it better if ADA coin owners have some control over the Cardano network?

The way the current financial world works is that all users of USD have no control over monetary policy. Monetary policy is controlled by the Federal Reserve Board (Fed). Users of USD must trust the Fed, which is a small group of actors. Holding BTC coins is essentially the same thing. BTC holders have to trust PoW miners and pool operators. The control of BTC holders over the behavior of miners and pool operators is minimal. As we said, most users do not and will not operate full nodes. Mining is an exclusive business. So BTC is very similar to fiat currency in terms of control. PoW miners, like the Fed, will always put their own interests above those of BTC holders. The only difference is that BTC holders rely on the immutability of Bitcoin rules. However, this is merely a kind of social contract between users and the team along with the mining participants.

Imagine if every single USD holder could decide monetary policy with his or her share. This is how PoS networks work. ADA holders have control over the network consensus and can directly decide which pool to support. In doing so, they essentially participate in decentralization, ensure that pools do not censor transactions, and can even directly decide monetary policy. Together, they guarantee that monetary policy remains unchanged. If it should change under any conditions, it will be decided by all ADA coin owners, not a small group of miners. This has nothing to do with the current fiat world.

I understand the argument that BTC is like gold because of mining, but I’m afraid that analogy is not accurate in the world of the internet. Moreover, through cryptocurrencies, we want to have a better system than the current financial one. The solution is to distribute power among all users, not to leave important powers to a small group of actors.

If we had to decide whether to replace the current financial world with a PoW or a PoS network, a PoS network definitely seems preferable. It appears to us to be an advantage that whoever holds the ADA coins also has proportional decision-making power in the network forever. Conversely, if people are forced to spend financial resources (energy consumption) in order to have decision-making power, this appears to be an exclusive system in which only the rich make decisions.

One of the other reasons is that no one can predict the future and it is very likely that network rules will have to be changed. For example, if Bitcoin’s security budget runs out and inflation needs to be introduced, who is to decide? Should it be the miners or all BTC coin holders? How will the voting be conducted? PoS networks are much better prepared for decentralized governance and for the future. 

The ability to easily adapt to new conditions can be a big advantage against rigid systems that cannot be changed. The debate is not about whether to change the rules or not, but mainly about who will decide. One of the basic rules of decentralization is that everyone in the system has equal status. This basically means that if the majority agrees to the change, it is fine and the change can be made.

# [Dow futures decline more than 300 points as market rebound fizzles](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures fell early Wednesday after the major averages jumped in regular trading hours, attempting to claw back some losses following weeks of selling.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 343 points or 1.1%, while S&amp;P 500 futures declined 1.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 1.6%.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Tuesday surged 641 points, or 2.15%. The S&amp;P 500 added 2.45%, turning in its best day since May 4. The jump comes after the benchmark index slumped 5.79% last week in its worst weekly performance since March 2020.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.51% on Tuesday, following its tenth week of losses in the last 11 weeks.
*****
&gt; Growing fears that the economy will tip into a recession have recently weighed on stocks. The Federal Reserve last week hiked interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, the central bank’s largest rate increase since 1994.
*****
&gt; The move came as the Fed tries to cool inflation, which has surged to a 40-year high.
*****
&gt; “We don’t see a U.S. or global recession in ’22 or ’23 in our base case, but it’s clear that the risks of a hard landing are rising,” UBS said Tuesday in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; “Even if the economy does slip into a recession, however, it should be a shallow one given the strength of consumer and bank balance sheets,” the firm added.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs, meantime, believes a recession is becoming increasingly likely for the U.S. economy, saying that the risks of a recession are “higher and more front-loaded.”
*****
&gt; “The main reasons are that our baseline growth path is now lower and that we are increasingly concerned that the Fed will feel compelled to respond forcefully to high headline inflation and consumer inflation expectations if energy prices rise further, even if activity slows sharply,” the firm said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Tuesday’s rally begs the question of whether the action is short-term relief after weeks of selling, or a meaningful change in sentiment. Tuesday’s strength was broad-based. All 11 S&amp;P sectors registered gains on the day, with energy leading the way, climbing 5.8%.
*****
&gt; “Our expectations are that market volatility will likely persist near term until the actions taken by the Federal Reserve thus far ... and the actions it takes going forward have had time to work through the system,” Oppenheimer said Tuesday in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Fed Chair Jerome Powell will appear before Congress on Wednesday, kicking off two days of testimony. On the earnings front, KB Home will post results after the market closes on Wednesday.

I now have a signed purchase agreement and so I think the next step is to submit this to the lenders to start the formal application process. However, what's not clear to me is whether I have to choose a single lender to apply with or if I can start an application with all of them and get a definitive lock on rates for each and then make a decision on who to go with. Can anyone help me understand how this should work? Would it be detrimental to apply to a few lenders? My credit score is very good (750+) and I'm not very concerned about being approved. I'm really just hoping to go with a lender with a decent rate and fees, but so far it's very hard to compare between them as interest rates change daily and fees are all summarized a bit differently. It seems like having things locked in more formally would make a comparison easier, but will applying to multiple lenders hurt me somehow?",finance,1655905598

personalfinance,Paying wife's student debt,"Intro: In our very first date, my (now) wife told me that she comes from Turkey and she has a state scholarship that pays her master and phd in Germany, provided that she goes back to Turkey and occupies a specific academic position. After some time together, we decided that we want to stay together in Germany. But then she has to pay back the money she got from the scholarship. We have been together for 3+ years. It was and is for me a big commitment to say: ""Your debt is our debt."" I come from southern Europe btw, but I live in Germany since 10+ years and I acquired the German nationality as well.

&amp;#x200B;

She will start having to repay when she finishes her phd, probably in the end of this year.

The debt is €150.000 accounted in € and it's at the moment interest free.

As soon as the repayment starts, interest starts counting.

We are not sure how high the interest rate will be, probably 5-10%.

The repayment schedule shall be as follows:

1st year: Pay 10% of the capital, i.e. 15.000€.

2nd year: Pay 20% of the capital, i.e. 30.000€.

3rd year: Pay 30% of the capital, i.e. 45.000€.

4th year: Pay 40% of the capital, i.e. 60.000€.

5th year: Pay the interest that accumulated during the previous 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

The payment is flexible, one has to contribute the yearly amount until the end of the year. Either all at some time during the year, or in more installments according to one's convenience.

Paying more than that amount is possible, then one will have to pay less in the last years and probably save some interest.

Trying to estimate the interest, a worst case scenario gives me around €45.000.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, we're both working, making €5500/month combined. We are very glad that we save around €3500-€4000 (€42-48K/year) and invest it in passive index ETFs and crypto (mainly btc+eth), plus some gold. We have at the moment around €200.000 invested.

We are saving as much as we can without feeling a deprived life. We live in a small flat, cook our own food and don't like buying fancy/expensive stuff. We enjoy travelling, so we give some extra money there.

We both have steady jobs. I make a bit more than her.

We're slowly coming in the mood for having a kid. We probably have to wait a few years for that. But kids do not cost much money in the first years, they cost effort and ...sleep. Speaking about Germany, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

My analysis about repaying the debt: 

The first two years (2023-2024) we can manage the monthly payments of €1250 and €2500 with our salary and actually still save. 

The 3rd year (2025) will be harder to cover the monthly €3750. We'll have to cut down costs and probably cash out some investments. 

The 4th year (2026) definitely have to cash out a good amount.

The 5th year (2027) shall not be worse than the 3rd.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a chance to postpone the beginning of repayment for 6-12 months that we will try to grab, I guess.

The more the repayment is postponed, the more it is inflated away, provided that our salaries and investments in average appreciate against it.

The only thing against that, is that the interest that will start counting after the beginning of the repayment may be higher.

&amp;#x200B;

The world situation is not optimal at the moment. I hope everything will be better in the next 3-4 years, when we'll probably need to cash out some money.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole situation is certainly some stress over our heads.

If all goes wrong, we can ask for some help from our families. They could support to a small extend. But they will have to sell flats/plots of land. We 'd only do that as a last resort.

&amp;#x200B;

Please be free to share your thoughts. I'll be happy to hear and discuss. I don't have a specific question. Just sharing my own thoughts.

CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the central bank will keep raising interest to fight inflation. So forget about the bottom for now.,"Jerome Powell just said it. Interest will keep going up without any sign of retraction. If we take the history we all know that every time inflation peaks the markets finds the bottom. You can check the data of previous crashes and make some conclusions. This is not advice, but if you’re in the group that thinks that “history repeats itself” it could be a good idea to wait a few months until the stock market and the crypto market dumps again and find a better enter position.
On the other side, I think that is not a bad idea to start a DCA strategy since we are really low in prices right now, specially BTC and ETH. I’m sure they will dump in the future, but maybe not enough to try to time the bottom.

CryptoCurrency,Can DeFi Solve Real Problems as it Matures?,"I started reading *DeFi and the Future of Finance* by Campbell R. Harvey, Ashwin Ramachandran, and Joey Santoro and it gives me some hope for the direction DeFi is heading. It is volatile and isn't user friendly now, but I think if it is given the chance to develop and evolve, there is a lot of potential there.

The authors believe that it provides solutions to the following five problems (text pulled and summarized from the book):

1. Centralized control: Banks control rates and fees. The four largest banks have a 44% market share of insured deposits and one consolidated entity attempts to set short-term interest rates and to influence the rate of inflation.
2. Limited access: About 1.7 billion people are unbanked which makes it difficult for them to obtain loans and to participate in internet commerce. Many must resort to payday lending to cover liquidity shortfalls. Additionally, banks may not bother with small loans for individuals and new businesses. Instead, it may suggest using a credit card with an extreme interest rate.
3. 3. Inefficiency: An example is the credit card interchange rate that causes consumers and businesses to lose up to 3% of a transaction's value with every swipe. Remittance fees are 5-7%. Time is wasted in the days it takes to ""settle"" a stock transaction (officially transfer ownership). In the current banking system, deposit interest rates are low and loan rates are high because banks need to cover their costs.
4. Lack of interoperability (this one loses me a little): The current environment for financial institutions lock interconnectivity. The U.S. financial system is siloed and designed to sustain high switching costs. Moving money from one institution to another can be unduly lengthy and complicated.
5. Opacity: The current financial system is not transparent. Customers have very little information on the financial health of their bank and instead must place their faith in the limited government protection of FDIC insurance on their deposits. Further, it is difficult to know if the rate they are offered on a loan is competitive. Even the lowest price still reflects legacy brick-and-mortar and bloats back-office costs.

Number four seems less and less of an issue these days (at least in the US). But other people may struggle with this.  With all of the people in this sub, I'd like to know your thoughts. 

Does DeFi help alleviate these problems?

Are they problems worth solving?

Are there more issues that should be discussed?

TLDR: DeFi has solutions for some of the current financial industry's problems: centralized control, limited access, inefficiency, lack of interoperability, and opacity. What are your opinions?",cryptocurrency,1655908159

personalfinance,Should I sell my investment property?,"Hello all, I'm looking for some advice. 

I own a rental property that has increased in value significantly in the past several years. I don't make a ton of money on this property each year and intentionally keep rents lower than similar properties to allow me to find the best tenants and fill the property quickly. After owning this property for some time I now have roughly $100k in equity (after taxes and realtor fees, this also accounts for the current market slowdown). 

I have $20k in a car loan, $20k in student loan debt and $3k debt in a 0% apr loan. Duel income (30M and 30F) of ~$120k a year and 2 kids under 2. 

I'm wondering if it's time to cash out. I've looked at opening a second mortgage or other loans on the properties value, but they essentially cut my profits to zero. Also the rates on these are pretty high. I'm wondering if I should cash out the property and then get rid of all the debt? (debt free would be awesome). Then I would throw the remaining money into some safe investments. 

My only reservation is that then I won't be able to get back into the real estate investing market for some time (maybe 5 to 10 years depending on how things go).

Just so everyone is on the same page, 20/4/10 says that 20% of the car should be paid for with a down payment (cash +trade in), the loan term should be no more than 4 years and the monthly payment should be no greater than 10% of your monthly income. Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule and might not be applicable to very low or very high income individuals but it can be very helpful to keep people from overspending on cars by spreading payments over 7 or 8 years (average car loan is now 72 months).

Now I know there are circumstances where taking a longer loan period might make sense. If you have a lot of cash on hand and can lock in a very low interest rate, it might make sense to stretch the loan out for cash flow for investing. But I think this should only be the case if the loan could originally fit under 20/4/10 parameters. Would love to hear what everyone has to say!",finance,1655917990

What I am confused about is - do you effectively “lock in” the permanent loan at the very beginning as well before you even start construction? So you don’t have to worry about potentially higher interest rates at the end of construction? 

So let’s say you met with underwriting a year ago and they quote you a fixed 4.5% rate. Is this the rate for both the construction period AND the “traditional” permanent mortgage after? I am trying to figure this out as I keep seeing people on Twitter saying they are in the middle of building a house and now wont be able afford it due to higher interest rates when construction is over.

personalfinance,Paying cash for large purchase or using personal loan to pay it？,"I found one type of saving secured loan with low interest rate.

They put your saving on hold as collateral, so all your saving will be put on hold until you pay it.

personalfinance,Thinking of getting a HELOC loan …?,"Please remove if this post is not allowed.

So we are thinking about getting a HELOC loan (if approved). Our current mortgage + HOA in los angeles is about $2000. So my spouse thinks that we are not paying our principal fast enough and wasting it on interest (about $300 of that $2000 is going towards our prinicipal).

So he is under the impression that if we get a HELOC loan for however much we owe, we can pay off the house faster.

When I do my research, i get confused because lots of people take this type of loan for home improvement purposes. I have yet to come across someone using it like how we are planning to use it. 

I understand the interest rate is variable and that worries me. If at the end of the day, we can only afford the same payment ($2000), we would be screwing ourselves. Right?

It would also look like a credit card debt on our credit report?

Is there anything else to be wary of? Thank you all in advance.",finance,1655928965

However it's been very difficult to pay more than the minimum on the credit card with the highest APR so I feel like I'm going nowhere with paying down my debt.

On top of all of this, I recently just got engaged and have started to think about wedding planning. It's been difficult to go ahead and start planning since I don't know what my future holds in terms of when to be able to pay off this debt.

I was thinking about taking out a 25k personal loan to at least ""pay off"" the 2 credit cards with the highest APR and then pay off the other two on my own. Not sure if this amount is too much, or what goes into figuring out how much to take out on a personal loan.

CryptoCurrency,"Recovery will happen, but be prepared for a very long winter","This sub can be, and usually is, an absolute disaster but it can also be a place of great constructive discussion, so here is my attempt. 

Many of us are eagerly scooping up crypto at these prices and for good reason. But I think it’s important to realize that recovery can take years, if not more. Hence, if you don’t think the token you’re buying can survive half a decade of economic recession, you might want to reconsider. Here are a couple of reasons:

- The economic impact of the pandemic is only just beginning to hit. The Fed is currently in an impossible position, where they basically have to pick between inflation and recession.  Political pressure will almost certainly hinder their ability to aggressively raise interest rates and QT over a longer period of time and markets still don’t really seem to take the Fed seriously. 
- The war in Ukraine is still ongoing and like with the pandemic the macro economic consequences are only barely coming to light. Ukraine is Europe’s second largest country and the conflict is brining NATO and Russia on the verge of a new Cold War which is already putting several major European counties in an economic squeeze. Add to that a likely global food crisis on top of the already substantial supply chain issues which will strain the global economy for quite some time.

Now, it’s possible markets will be back at ATH within a year, but it could also take a decade. If you’re tempted to invest in risky assets be sure to do your research and figure out what the risk is and whether you can accept it. I’d go so far as to say that most of the top 100 coins won’t survive a two year bear market of the unprecedented type we might experience in the near future, including several in the top 10. 

I’m not trying to scare investors away, but I urge you all to leave your emotions at the door and think through where you’re putting your money. I’m never selling my Bitcoin but if you think every memecoin is going back to ATH, I think you’re in for a letdown.",cryptocurrency,1655931589

personalfinance,ARM or Fixed rate for our situation?,"My wife and I are shopping for a home. We missed out on the outstanding rates a few months back. Fortunately, we both have solid incomes. We make about $120,000 to $130,000 a year gross.

The problem is that my credit isn't the greatest. We were single income for 4 years while she was in nursing school. Because of that and decisions prior to our meeting, my credit is between 630 and 680 depending on which bureau you pull. Hers is 690+ and into the 710's. I have 6.5k credit card debt that I can pay off tomorrow without touching our down payment for a home. I also have some medical accounts that are delinquent to the tune of approximately $1400. Could pay those off as well. Beyond that, I know I have one missed car payment from 2019ish. That was an honest mistake because I paid her car note twice and didn't realize I hadn't paid mine. That's all that's been mentioned to me by a couple of people we're working with.

So, given that we expect to have no debt except for one private student loan(hopefully paid off in 3 years), federally subsidized student loans, and one car note(paid hers off in April), would an ARM be feasible? With a 5/1 or 7/1, my credit score should increase fairly substantially over the next few years I'd imagine, with the added benefit of a longer work history and larger credit profile for both of us. We could lock in a much lower rate in the meantime further freeing up cash to pay off the above mentioned debts, put towards principal on the home, or invest/save. I could then refinance once rates are trending down, or lock in at a more favorable fixed rate once my credit has improved. 5 or 7 years before the first adjustment should give enough time for both options to be feasible and likely.

Other pertinent info, my income is likely to stay relatively flat over the next 3 to 5 years. Maybe trending up slightly. As a first year ICU nurse, my wife's income is expected to go up fairly quickly. She's already received roughly a 10% raise within her first six months. There are two major hospitals in our town that make it fairly easy to bounce between the two for better pay as well. There are also multiple psychiatric facilities in the area that are in constant need of nurses and frequently hire people to work one shift a week at rates hovering around $45 to $60 an hour. She currently makes $27.50 an hour. She's also only working 3 days a week currently so can pretty easily pick up an extra few shifts a month.

The home we're looking at is within budget without the potentially lower ARM rate. Just trying to work through options. We are able to put down a bit over 20% for the homes we're considering.",finance,1655938614

Bitcoin,Putin: BRICS are working on a basket-based reserve currency,"As was my concern and I've written about. This is why I don't see a situation where the USD doesn't go hyper in the next 24 months. Debt, inflation, and interest rates already have the USD trapped in a vortex that's effectively inescapable (Robert Triffin predicted this eventuality in the 60s), but blunting foreign demand of Treasuries, and blurring the petrodollar with something like this BRIC reserve is the straw that will do the breaking, accelerating the time frame from managed decline to a more sudden reality. If you're watching the DXY's incredible strength (has been on a relentless uptrend since January 2021), you might imagine an engine knocking, or the Weimar papiermark--which is to say volatility before the break. The papiermark gained dramatically against gold at times in the decade it took for the parabola of its hyperinflation to complete. Most thought it was a straight line. False. It was extreme volatility. Now replace gold with BTC and the papiermark with the USD on this chart. Where are we relationally?

CryptoCurrency,Tether - steady outflows a drain on reserves,"Tether's market cap has fallen from $82bn on 31 Mar 2022 to $67bn on 22 Jun 2022. It decreased by $15bn in close to 3 months (falling on average by $5bn per month).

Assuming this rate of decline doesn't decrease, by the end of the year, we could see tether supply falling to \~$37bn. By Jun 2023, we could see supply drop to \~$7bn.

We know from Tether's reserve report (link below) that as of 31 Mar 2022, they had total assets of $82bn. Of which:

* $70bn is in very high-quality and liquid assets (cash/treasury bills/high quality commercial paper) that can easily be converted into cash.
* Remaining $12bn is in secured loans/corporate bonds/and others.

As tether tether circulation decreases, Tether is likely liquidating its highest quality reserves, that $70bn of cash/treasury bills/high quality commercial paper, to meet redemptions first, because they are the most liquid and easiest to convert into cash.

Once tether runs out of those high-quality reserves, it will have to liquidate its remaining $12bn of reserves. its unclear what these assets actually are, for example, tether has $3bn of secured loans as their reserve, but who's the borrower? what is the security backing these loans? Are the collateral crypto related assets? Do they need to be marked down? How quickly can these loans be liquidated? These questions have to be asked for other assets on Tether's balance sheet too.

As discussed elsewhere, tether also has a history of poor corporate governance and internal control, as documented in a US lawsuit (link below). Among others, tether:

* Loaned close to $1bn to Bitfinex (context: Bitfinex put customers deposits in a firm called Crypto Capital, and Crypto Capital's accounts got seized by the Polish regulators, so Bitfinex couldn't access its customer's deposits and needed a bailout from Tether)
* Tether didn't have a bank account for 6months but continued to issue tether. Tether deposited its cash to its general counsel's account, instead of a company account
* At one point, Tether only had $61m in its bank account but had $440m tether in circulation.
* Tether is banked by Deltec Bank, a Bahamas bank. Has anyone heard of this bank?
* Tether's auditor is 3rd/4th tier
* Tether had a one point over $80bn of assets, but its reserve report (which are not even audited) is just a few pages. This type of disclosure is very weak and does not meet financial reporting standards in the US for financial institutions.

Due to the poor internal controls, poor reserve disclosure, rising interest rates which may negatively affect the value of Tether's reserves, we have to take a discount when evaluating Tether's reserve. I'd say 10-20% as a minimum.

So I'd guesstimate tether's real reserve to be worth $66-74bn (being $82bn discounted by 10-20%). That means, if the amount of tethers in circulation falls by another $51-59bn, tether would not have sufficient liquidity to fund redemptions. At the current rate of supply decrease of $5bn per month, Tether would run out of reserve in 10 months. Which would also mean, if you get out of tether now, you can have all of your money back, if you choose to exit in 10 months, you might not.

Disclosure: this is my opinion only, I have no long or short positions in tether or any other crypto

tldr: If tether supply continues to decrease at the current pace, I think tether's liquidity will be drained in 10 months

Hear me out, we’ve been in a decades long slump in interest rates. Lower and lower and lower and lower.

The impact of this is that ETF bond distributions have been on a decade long slump. Do you think we could see a reversal such that your distributions would actually *increase* in the way dividend aristocrats increase their dividends every year thereby becoming the new “dividend growth” strategy but with coupons from bond ETF distributions instead?

Before you say no way we will in long term continue to lower rates in order to keep the machine going after every crisis, but what if there’s another way?

Instead of relying on rates, we instead increase or cut taxes to keep money in circulation or “suck it out” of the system whenever we need to prevent deflation spiral.

We cut debts to increase pent up demand.

We print money to increase inflation *in times where we want to prevent deflationary spirals*.

Finally, albeit controversial, we consider a CBDC which will cap consumption on goods that are inflating too much and offer benefits like more CBDC on things that are deflating too much.

All this happens while interest rates creep up in the background for the next  decades, thereby having coupons going up and up and as a result bond ETF distributions increasing as well.

Is it possible?

personalfinance,Getting into rental properties,"Obligatory apologies for not knowing and thank you for your time...

I am trying to get into rental properties and I recently heard about having the seller be the bank, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I imagine it would go like this: Write up a purchase agreement with the help of a title attorney, outlining that if I miss a payment, then the property goes back to the seller, yadda, yadda. Use an amortization schedule with some reasonable amount of interest rate as the basis for the payments, as an attached document to the purchase agreement. The seller then has a deed of trust and I would have the deed. 

This way, it works out so the seller gets a lot more money than whatever amount they were asking, and I don't have to go through the bank and can deal directly with the seller.

Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

77. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources. It’s been obvious this was coming for a while ever since the reports of mining operations dumping hot waste water into the finger lakes and affecting the ecology. In a place like New York, that kind of thing won’t go unnoticed.

78. Reports are also coming in that the Biden Administration crypto plans due in August will target Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains over their “sky high” energy consumption. I think we all knew this would eventually come despite the wide spectrum of clever rationalizations regarding Bitcoin’s energy use by its maximalists.

Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill.

Got any others?","Hello all, I recently signed on with a company that allows me to make an account with either Tech CU or Meriwest. I am residing in the east coast, and will be indefinitely. However, I do want an account with a credit union, as my current bank has terrible customer support, and I want to make an account with a CU because they seem to have overall better customer support, loan rates, credit cards, etc.

I also found Penfed and Alliant in recommendations here, and I am leaning towards Penfed due to their credit card.

Since I am going to be completely remote, online/phone customer support is the only thing that matters to me when it comes to the employee-customer interaction. I almost exclusively use online banking with my current bank, and if I want to transfer cash or physical money, I will just move it to my current bank and then to the CU account.

Additionally, I do plan on opening a credit card with whichever CU I sign up with, so the credit card is important too. I will probably need to take out loans much later in the future to help boost my credit, but I don't expect to need any big loans in the next 10 or so years. I really like Penfed's Platinum Rewards Visa Signature Card (5x points on gas, 3x pts on supermarkets and internet, 1x points on other stuff), and Meriwest's Visa Signature Max Cash Preferred Card (5% cashback on up to $2000 on certain things, 2% on gas or groceries, 1% elsewhere).

I'd like some firsthand accounts on any of these, the biggest things for me at the moment is having a good credit card, customer service, and extremely low or no foreign transaction fees for the debit/credit cards. 

I wanted you guys' advice, and recommendations for competitors if you think I should look elsewhere. I thought that a CU offered by my employer exclusively would be better, but I guess that's not always true.",finance,1655971737

economy,Responsibility of the intellectual,"The genius American poet Ezra Pound was a supporter of fascism and a personal friend of Mussolini. One of the most important French writers, Louis-Ferdinand Celine, endorsed racism and worked closely with the collaborationist Vichy government. The greatest German philosopher Martin Heidegger had high hopes for Nazism and was a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. These and some other examples are absolute exceptions to the world of intellectuals during the Second World War. Then the vast majority of them took firm anti-fascist and anti-Nazi positions.

Today it is customary among opinion leaders to be cosmopolitans and pacifists. All of them now advocate peace and stand against war. However, a fairly large part of both Western and Russian independent intellectuals have not fully decided on the causes of the Russian-Ukrainian war. Some believe that Putin built a fascist-type totalitarian state during his 23 years in office, which proclaimed neo-imperialism the basis of its foreign policy. These people know that the war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine began back in 2014 (8 years ago), and could only end with the complete disappearance of the Ukrainian state from the political map of the world. But other intellectuals repeat the Kremlin's theses about the illegal expansion of NATO, the unjustified increase in the number of EU member states, the West's prejudiced attitude towards Russia, and so on. Some Western opinion leaders willingly argue that it is impossible to equate the leadership of the Russian Federation and the entire Russian people, despite the fact that 83% of the country's population supports the Kremlin's foreign policy.

Surprisingly, many of Putin's former Russian friends, now living in the developed democratic countries of the West, like to publicly speculate about the ""weakness of this form of government"", the ""advantages of a strong hand"" and the ""need to establish a new world order in a multipolar world."" In general, the lack of unanimous condemnation of the Putin regime by Western and Russian opinion leaders cannot but cause extreme surprise.

In this situation, a good example for intellectuals was set by the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize winner, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov, who sold his Nobel medal at an auction in the US for $103.5 million, and sent all the proceeds to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to help Ukrainian refugee children and their families. Although the media claim that this case was the most expensive sale of the Nobel medal in the history of the award, however, the main thing in this story is not the amount of money. 

More important is the recognition by a leading Russian journalist that the entire Russian society is responsible for not resisting the rise and strengthening of a misanthropic regime that recognizes as people only those who consider themselves adherents of the ideology of the “Russian World”.

The war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine threatens to develop into a major continental war any day. For example, today Moscow is rudely threatening Poland and Lithuania with military measures. Who knows what tomorrow will bring?

# [Stock futures gain as market attempts to rebound from 2022 sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/stock-futures-are-little-changed-after-major-averages-dip-investors-mull-slowdown.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose on Thursday, as the market tried recover some of the steep losses suffered in 2022, even as recession risks rise on Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 traded 0.8% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 168 points, or 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%.
*****
&gt; The major averages came into Thursday’s session posting strong gains for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up more than 2% in that time, while the Dow has risen nearly 2%.
*****
&gt; To be sure, stocks closed slightly lower on Wednesday as investors weighed the likelihood of a recession.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress the central bank is “strongly committed” to bringing down inflation. He also noted that a recession is a “possibility,” a fear that has continued to weigh on Wall Street.
*****
&gt; “The odds are more likely in favor of a recession than not,” Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management chief strategist, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “That speaks to the degree of tightening that the Federal Reserve is going to have to do now, having not done so in prior periods when perhaps they would have avoided some of the problems that are going to happen as a result.”
*****
&gt; “Unfortunately, it’s going to be more economic pain than people at least six months ago anticipated, but are increasingly coming around to the reality that that’s probably what’s going to happen,” he added.
*****
&gt; UBS is the latest investment bank this week to raise its odds of a recession to 69%, citing lackluster data last week in housing, industrial production and capital goods.
*****
&gt; “We are now watching out for any further negative follow-through or whether we simply hit a local peak and some growth momentum in the hard data resumes,” UBS said in a Thursday note.
*****
&gt; Citigroup increased its odds of a recession to 50%, citing a slide in consumer demand that could make it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to achieve a soft landing.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs said the probability of a downturn is “higher and more front-loaded” than it was previously. In a Monday note, the firm raised its bet of a U.S. recession to 30%, up from 15%, over the next year. It increased those odds to 48%, up from 35%, over the next two years.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, investors will be looking forward to fresh jobless claims data. Powell will also give remarks to the House, after having addressed the Senate Wednesday. The remarks are part of a congressionally mandated semiannual report on monetary policy.

CryptoCurrency,Industrial Money,"**Gold**

There’s nothing intuitive about a deflationary economic base layer—not at first. Imagine seeing Dick Fosbury for the first time flop backwards over the olympic high-jump bar, a technique which at the time had never been used. The crowd laughed at the 1968 Mexico olympics, until they felt his focus, he felt theirs, and he won gold. Since then, nobody has set a record jumping any other way.

&gt;*“If kids try to imitate Fosbury, he’ll wipe out an entire generation of high jumpers, because they’ll all have broken necks.”*

**Cables, Wires, and Waves**

Perhaps our closest analogue to a deflationary network—like bitcoin’s payment network—is the internet. With the internet’s deflation, an overabundance of information is created outside computing’s ever shrinking hard drives and silicon; then with cables, wires, and waves, the velocity of that information is scaled to light speed, settling instantly, at effectively zero cost.

Proof-of-stake can achieve this in layers. The main argument against proof-of-stake is its plutocratic staking consensus, which is directionally a centralizing force. But perhaps at odds with most critics, this isn’t my main argument against proof-of-stake. My argument against it starts by posing this question:

By what mechanism does proof-of-stake create an overabundance of goods and services OUTSIDE the money?

**Deflation is not good**

First let's assume you have a global deflationary base layer that scales money to the velocity that the internet scales information. Great. Ostensibly then, this should create an overabundance of goods and services OUTSIDE the money, just like the internet produced an overabundance of information OUTSIDE its ever shrinking hard drives and silicon, like I mentioned above. Then we eliminate discrete payment networks (Visa, PayPal, SWIFT, etc) because they’e redundant, and once you’ve connected the entire world to this same payment network, you can arbitrage the global economy. Furthermore, because everyone is using the same money on the same network, incentives are aligned. This is all beautiful stuff so far, but does it work? Absolutely not. The deflation will wholly decimate every economy and eventually the world. Deflation is as foolish as blockchains themselves, which are slow, expensive, and difficult to manage things if they’re sufficiently decentralized, and there’s zero purpose to using a blockchain that isn’t \[decentralized\], unless you desire the sovereign theatre it provides for your carpetbagging enterprise.

So what’s the reason for this decentralized-deflationary reserve currency’s failure?

You can’t create an overabundance of goods and services without an overabundance of energy

Let’s assume for a moment this proof-of-stake protocol successfully does separate money from state. Then who’s left to subsidize and incentivize flexible load and base load energy, especially off-peak? How does the recycling mechanism of money, energy, and prosperity work? A decentralized-deflationary system doesn’t work without that energy overabundance. What we want to see in a deflationary candidate is the emergence of industrial grade attachments to major grids the world over.

**Energy**

The prosperity of a nation can be directly measured by its ENERGY, and its ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

Energy grid waste is high. It depends on the grid, but the most efficient state grids in the United States are about 6%. Many grids get all the way up to 30% waste of their energy. The wind still blows while everyone sleeps. The water still runs. A nuclear plant doesn’t have to idle a reactor because it’s tired. Much of this isn’t included in waste because it gets disconnected or is powered off. It’s skewed because renewables still try selling their energy into a grid even at a loss (negative prices) because the write-offs make up for it. The mandate of every utility in the world is governed by reliability and uptime. This incentivizes grids to overproduce electricity, which is necessary, for the same reason you don’t eat *just enough* calories to stay living, or drink *just enough* fluids for your organs to function.

So perhaps energy is the ultimate currency/money? No.

1: Energy can’t be a store of value because there’s no way to store it, not without losing electrons over time. Not without facilities you trust for safekeeping, which gets into the issue of trust that hurt gold. Otherwise this would be like carrying batteries around or using helium gas to store value.

2: Even if it was storable, it wouldn’t matter, because it’s inherently inflationary if we assume human progress continues, and over time we use more energy, not less. And counterintuitively, the expression from this would actually be damaging and travel oppositely: meaning the inflation would only drive up the cost of energy, and demand would play out, enter: trust, conflict and less abundance. This, in some telling, is the folly of trying to hard-back a currency with any commodities. In fact, it’s the folly of a currency being physical at all.

&amp;#x200B;

We want the issuance of energy and money to travel in opposite directions. Meaning inflation of energy allows prosperity, and the deflationary money stores it. Try thinking of it in a circle that gets rounded by its own deflationary gravity: the deflationary money subsidizes the mining (through block rewards &amp; transaction fees), the mining then subsidizes energy, the energy in turn subsidizes prosperity (goods and services), which the deflationary money then absorbs—recycle.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x7xkpmu88d791.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=affb92a18a8d8255cf7678f6ac719718041f502a

It the real world—and at odds with our current base layer of fiat/debt—it allows a worker to save the fruits of their labor over time and space. It challenges mindless consumerism, because when I know money is worth more in the future, I’ll be more thoughtful on how I spend it in the present—too many people discount the role mindless consumerism plays in climate change. It also favors the people who acquire the money *next*, meaning a person with a bunch of bitcoin that spends it now on a big house or big boat gets to enjoy life, but the person that acquired that bitcoin from them will over time get a bigger house and bigger boat. It sort of scales linearly, with the entropy of human life, in a way our current system can’t. Third-world countries aren’t at such disadvantages over time either. It also starts working well when large scale automation and other conveniences arrive through technological innovation (deflation) taking jobs. But without the robust energy perspective, it’s empty and destructive.

As an aside, I’ll add that this energy incentivizing deflationary system (if it worked) is likely to absorb value parabolically, before growing slowly and safely. For example, bitcoin doesn’t target a stable price, it targets a variable price. It can control its ledger and issuance with the one-directional entropy of energy, and the free market sets the price. As it absorbs enough trust (value) its confidence curve (volatility) will flatten. Its value thereafter gets determined by whatever new goods and services are added to the global economy, related to global energy efficiency. This is obviously opposite of a system that targets a stable price like the USD. For that requires coercive trust. A toolkit of institutions to pull strings, manipulate, start fires and put out others. You need a global military for your global reserve to achieve this. And in the end, as we’ve seen persistently, it never works.

Anyway, all this leads to a controversial take on PoW that some might guess is coming and others won’t like. But first, some energy grid realities:

* Energy is not fungible. Meaning the further it travels, the more energy is lost. You need parochial grids. A grid in Texas can’t power a home in Montana
* Flexible load energy refers to unreliable and renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind. When the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow, the capacity of these are impaired. Since this makes their outputs unpredictable and can’t be stored, you need base load energy to stabilize a grid. Examples of these would be nuclear power, fossil fuels, and in certain locales, hydropower
* Energy can’t be stored on an industrial scale. Lithium and rare earths for batteries are quite expensive, labor intensive, damaging to the environment, and time consuming. People often conflate technological achievements with economic achievements. Sending people to the moon with an unlimited budget and resources is a technological achievement. The economic achievement would be scaling it to send everyone that wanted to moonwalk, to the moon. What’s unique however, is how PoW might eventually subsidize this cumbersome industry.

**Spectrum or layers?**

&gt;*“Decentralization is a spectrum.”*

Who coined this phrase depends on who you ask, but it sounds like a nervous youth saying: “I’m sort of pregnant.” To which you can imagine a mother replying:

“You either are or you’re not.”

My belief is all things that work get built in layers. Wether that’s a human body, a planet, an atom, or pizza. So I’ll say, at the risk of attracting the ire of maxi’s (which I consider myself):

Decentralization is layered.

And now without beating around the bush, here it is:

Mining should mostly be the privilege of corporations, industry, and countries. Then to a lesser degree, individuals with their own renewable operations—although even here I believe if large enough, acquisition is imminent.

If not this, and instead we have a bunch of hobbyists running GPU’s in their basements, immobile ASIC’s in their garages, or CPU’s around campus, deflation doesn’t work on a global “reserve asset” level. No overabundance of goods and services inbound. This pleb-based decentralized mining is fantastic for a young embryonic system that’s fragile and easily aborted by a single deep-pocketed vector; a newborn system whose brain still has a dearth of nodes. But after the bootstrapping, as it scales say, to absorb the legacy system, and dispose of all the ever growing infrastructure that rose to coral an ever increasing inflationary money supply, it needs mass. For at the global scale, you need industrial grade mining attached to industrial sized grids that can be turned on/off as the grid’s circumstances necessitate, whereby the grid’s heartbeat (frequency) along with its parochial demand decide that. This means turning off mining on-peak when stability or a surplus is unavailable to subsidize. That means running hard off-peak to absorb all the waste, make the grid hyper-efficient, and fill the coffers of renewable energy creators with money, which up until the present time has been the charge of governments through manipulation of the tax code (write-offs, credits, import duties, etc), and is at odds with free market efficiency. Mining operations can power off within 30 seconds, and power back on within 30 seconds. No industry has ever existed to do what mining can do for waste and stability, aligning the incentives of grids and energy providers, while replacing the government’s deceptive hand, itself subsidized by taxpayers.

**So how does the system remain decentralized bro?**

Nodes dawg. Plebs should be running nodes. Nodes are everything. It’s nodes that will deliver the sovereign computing web3 mistakenly believes dapps, venture capital, and speculative tokens somehow do. It’s nodes that eventually will allow us to eliminate SAS (software as a service), lever personal servers the size of credit cards that require no programming knowledge (technical friction) to use, and produce the mesh networks that bypass ISP’s (internet service providers). It’s nodes that decide wether or not to run any upgraded version of bitcoin’s software, all versions of which are backwards compatible, all nodes of which can opt-out of any. Nodes require zero bitcoin to run. It’s the nodes that easily dismissed the majority of mining hashpower, venture capitalists, and the collusion of Coinbase when they tried hard-forking bitcoin during SegWit2x for larger block sizes. It’s nodes that can pull a UAHF (user activated hard fork), and nodes that can together reject any sus miner’s blocks. Miners are just hired security providers. This sovereign computing is what Jack Dorsey’s \[somewhat questionably named\] web5 embraces. Nodes are sovereign. Anyone can run a node. The bitcoin blockchain is a minuscule 412 GB as of this writing, and many of the hardware nodes now include the Lightning Network and are becoming quite powerful little things with their own applications. A new 1TB hard drive costs about $20. Nodes connect us globally, independent of governments. So the decentralized ethos, in my opinion, should focus on node proliferation. The part of the network tethered to the physical world (mining) is different, in that mining has its own free-market, its own competitive target to become as efficient as possible, and its own economy of scale. The miner’s endogenic job is to provide security for the bitcoin network. The miner’s exogenic job is to provide energy efficiency for the world—the scale of which is enormous.

Any country, business, or person can mine bitcoin obviously—it’s permissionless—and since mining uses electricity, any energy source that can produce this works, and over time the economy of scale trends toward renewable, otherwise the endeavor becomes unprofitable. I’m not certain bitcoiners should fight this, a person might say because one of these is a whale and the other an elephant; both formidable in their own element, but no danger to one another. But I prefer to say nodes make up the federal government and miners make up the states; if this was an decentralized inflationary system, it might be the opposite. Mining is directionally decentralizing because the sun, wind, water, fossil fuels, \[and nuclear\] are distributed across the world. Incentives run parallel too. It’s a competitive business that requires a continuous expenditure of resources, sometimes unprofitably. Even if a country does find a massive new source of energy or efficiency, it doesn’t matter, because of the bitcoin network’s difficulty adjustment, which ensures you can’t accelerate blocks over any relevant period of time. Thus its monetary policy stays fixed not just in space but in time. The playing field is evened for everyone.

The truth is, up until 2019, I didn’t actually believe bitcoin would work beyond a novelty or discrete form of money, certainly not a world reserve, because I hadn’t seen evidence that its system could output and recycle the byproducts of energy on the industrial scale required to make a deflationary global reserve system run. I’ve now seen roots and peaking green shoots of this expression. I’d think that at this point 13-years on with exponential growth, bitcoin would’ve run into an unworkable problem thanks to the complexity it must absorb, like an author wandering their fiction into a corner requiring a complete rewrite. It’s programmable money of course, but notwithstanding, it’s the thing that’s surprised me most about it.

**Breathe, almost done**

Congratulations if you’ve stayed with me this far in this overly long and rambling post, rest assured, you’ll have plenty of time to recheck bitcoin’s price or your empty inbox, the pain is almost over.

**Petrodollar/Petrocurrency**

Our current world reserve currency—the inflationary USD—requires an attachment to energy itself to function as a **global reserve**. It’s called the petrodollar, which uses petrodollar recycling. This scheme started with Saudi Arabia in 1945, but the term petrodollar and its evolution came about after the gold standard ended in 1971 and the US (and thus world) suffered serious stagflation going into an oil crisis. The US had a much stronger hand back in the 70s to combat this than they carry today because interest rates were already quite high (7%+), debt quite small (debt/GDP 33%), and the manufacturing base still in its early stages of getting gutted thanks to Triffin’s Dilemma. Decentralized money didn’t exist either. They also had an ace up their sleeve, pegging the USD in a way that drove artificial foreign demand for Treasuries via oil--petrodollars.

Here’s a low-level flyby with the most important bits: Middle-East countries (and a few others) agree to sell their oil in USD. This means anyone that buys this energy—which is necessary for their economy to run—must have access to USD. The surplus from these oil sales are deposited into the US stock market, in foreign banks, and with the IMF. The banks loan these deposits to governments in need of financing for their payment deficits. Much of the money these government borrowers spend is to buy more energy from their debtors. In the event oil price rise too much, the IMF will loan the deposits to the countries with balance of payment problems. It’s a disturbing cycle of debt and recycling. The US/USD enjoys persistent trade deficits and becomes global hedge money. They can perpetually finance their own current deficits by issuing Treasuries at very low rates of interest, and can also buy energy with its own products, which is why you see billions in surplus weapons transferred to Saudi Arabia annually. The USD then, is directly pegged to energy. It doesn’t work as a **global reserve**currency without that. And we’re starting to see cracks everywhere in this scheme. China has been steadily dumping their Treasuries while plenty of deals for petrodollar energy in different currencies are emerging, from Russia to India. It also appears these countries have been steadily stockpiling gold, but because they’re not foolish enough to custody it in London or New York, it’s difficult to say what they have.

**Conclusion**

Our current economic base layer is fiat and debt. This is a dishonest system. Nothing built over a dishonest base layer can ever be honest. What we’re missing is an honest transparent base layer, otherwise we’re doomed to suffer the “*distortion in money*” which is causing so much “*distortion in information*” as Jeff Booth has so eloquently stated.

Trying to finesse the global monetary base layer at the protocol level with nothing more than a simple layered blockchain scaling for TPS, TX cost, and throughput is myopic rubbish. It’s an example of ineptitude, and telling of the illiteracy some people have regarding how the world works in the meatspace outside the money. So it’s my belief that, without a vigorous relationship between protocol and energy, and no plan to subsidize, incentivize, or recycle the yields at an industrial scale, there’s no mechanism by which proof-of-stake can implement a viable decentralized payment network that separates money from state. Instead, what will rapidly play out and express itself—in an absence of abundance—is its plutocracy, enabled by staking, staking derivatives, those with access to cheap capital (carry trades), and its original sin of pre-mine beneficiaries, most of this run via validators through third-party server farms. It’s a system more centralizing, more conflict-inducing, and less fair than what we have already, and if what we have already is a system that incentivizes theft of productive output, then imagine a system with scarcity in both money AND desirable goods. Cantillionaire+. That’s not a world I’m interested in, but that’s the world *crypto* and its venture capital express as some self-sovereign utopia. Vitalik Buterin himself recently said at another one of the endless conferences he attends—this particular one being VivaTech in Paris—that “*cryptocurrency won’t replace fiat.*” And I agree, because bitcoin is not *crypto*, and like most altcoin devs you meet, he doesn’t understand the macro outside the protocol anymore than your average voter, and also assumes fiat is forever. I haven’t got a clue what we’re doing any of this for then. Because decentralized money *is* the innovation. And the radical idea is separation of money from state. There’s no reason for any of this stuff otherwise.

Deflationary systems are strange and unintuitive. Everything gets flipped like Dick Fosbury’s flop.

**Signing-off**

This is my final post until the day sats reach 1¢ in USD parity. I’m stepping away to work on a project certain of an implementation on the Lightning Network, which will require all my time. Replacing the world’s money will take so much effort, a pioneer’s effort of showing up riding a horse, wearing two pistols, willing to endure the privation of clearing the land, and whatever comes out of it. It’s a good possibility that a successful deflationary base layer is this generation’s contribution to the world. And in order for it to safely happen, patience and other virtues welcome. Currently, the LN has nowhere near the capacity or reliability to deliver unto the world money scaled to the velocity of information the internet achieved. At least not yet. We’re also in the early innings of miners gaining industrial competence and attaching to grids. Intel but recently announced ASIC mining silicon. Mainstream talking points and energy illiteracy still dominate conversations of even smart people who don’t understand the basic implications of a deflationary global reserve base layer—🗣 \*change bitcoin’s code!\*So I want to move beyond the fun cocktail chatter where we separate crypto into neat spaces, and I want to get to work. Thank you so much for reading any of the \[ridiculous\] stuff I’ve put out there, apologies for any egotistical rebuttals, and I enjoyed all your replies, our camaraderie, the various posts—yes, especially the memes. It’s been a short while, but it’s been a slice. I’ll feel you on the other side of 1¢ sats wherever you are. Farewell.

**Postscript:**

If any game theory or governmental persons read this for whatever reason, and the West finds itself harried by an adversary’s new hard-backed currency, I’d remind you that bitcoin mining's difficulty adjustment happens every 2016 blocks. The reverse of that number is 6102, which refers to *Executive Order 6102* of 1933. You can demonetize this enemy with a reverse 6102, by coordinating with allies, leaking, then dumping all gold onto the open market. I leave that to suggest to you what it may.

personalfinance,Pause retirement savings or PMI?,"I live in NJ, paying inherited low rent (was through some program) in a non-desired small apartment, and eventually would need to move to a better school area when our child is at the school age at most.

I have saved already in cash (not to include retirement accounts) $128K, but according to YNAB I have only $31K can be used as down payment, while the rest is distributed among various categories (such as $33K for an upcoming second car since we have only one car now).

My wife is currently staying home, but once our child hits 2 years old mark she plans to send her to a daycare and search for a job (hence the need to the second car). My gross income is a bit over $100K. The choice I made is to pause the retirement savings (only contribute to 401K up to the employer match) so any extra would be put towards the home down payment (20% down + closing costs would be around $100K in NJ!).

The other choice I could do, is to forget about the 20% and do only 5% or so (with PMI) or more while continue maxing out retirement accounts. Also contributing to 401K would save me (in addition to the deferred federal income tax) another 3-5% in state income taxes. 

We are in our mid forties and a bit late with retirement savings ($233K as of today are in retirements accounts). Any advice? Thanks",finance,1655990093
solar,Thoughts on our bids? (SC),"I'd appreciate some help evaluating a couple of the bids we've gotten so far. We are on EnergySage, but have only gotten one bid from that so far. It's much lower than our other two bids from companies we reached out to directly, but it's also with lower-tier panels and inverters. I don't know if the market around us is just pricier or if we should wait it out for more bids. 

**Background:**

- We are in SC and our electric usage averages around 1000-1200 kWh/month, but varies pretty dramatically between winter and summer because we have a gas furnace. We will likely switch to an electric heat pump in the next few years, which would increase our electric usage overall but reduce our winter bills by a lot. I also have an EV which pushes our usage up some, but not a ton because I don't drive often. 

- We have 1:1 net metering, but on a TOU structure (i.e. we pay more for energy bought from the utility during peak hours, but are also compensated at that higher rate for any that we produce during those hours). The *difference* between on/off peak rates in summer is $0.177, with peak hours from 2-7PM, and in winter it's $0.150, with peak from 7 to noon. 

- Our roof is not ideal because of it's orientation and some surrounding oak trees (which we can't, and honestly wouldn't want to, cut down), but from the projections solar is very workable, and we get a lot of sun on our roof for most of the day. We are in the process of replacing our shingle roof with standing seam, and we've heard conflicting information about whether the standing seam clips make solar installation more expensive or cheaper compared to mounting to a shingle roof. 

- We haven't gotten quotes for batteries yet, but I'd also appreciate any general thoughts on whether it could make sense in our situation to add batteries at some point down the line for backup power and to take advantage of the TOU rates.
 

**BID 1: LOCAL INSTALLER**

- **System Size:** 11.6 kW

- **Panels:** 29 REC400AA Pure Black

- **Inverters:** Enphase IQ8M-72-2-US

- **Cash Price:** $38,976 ($19,098 after federal and state incentives)

- **Projected First Month Generation/Offset:** 11,771 kWh, 105%

- **Projected Payback:** 11.2 years

- **Price/watt:** $3.36

- **Other Information:** We just get 'good vibes' from this company, and they did the electrical work for our EVSE and it was a good experience.  They have master electricians in-house and manage the installation and any warranty/service work themselves. I work in the clean energy space so am knowledgeable enough to be dangerous, and they have been responsive and direct at answering my questions. I know $3/watt is a good target overall, but is this price reasonable for the higher-end equipment? We're definitely leaning toward just signing the papers for them.



**BID 2: SMALL NATIONAL INSTALLER A**

- **System Size:** 12.4 kW

- **Panels:** 31 QCell 400

- **Inverters:** Enphase IQ8-60-2-US

- **Cash Price:** $46,155 ($22,616 after federal and state incentives)

- **Projected First Month Generation and Offset:** 13,303 kWh, 101%

- **Projected Payback:** Not calculated

- **Price/watt:** $3.72

- **Other Information:** Obviously this is too expensive, and I've noticed a few minor red flags. They didn't calculate payback period, and when I asked about it his response was ""what's your payback if you don't install solar"", inverters seem undersized for the panels, they don't model our house in Aurora until after you sign paperwork (whereas the first company did that before designing the proposal). But after seeing this bid I'm wondering if our market is just more expensive. 



**BID 3: ENERGYSAGE INSTALLER**

- **System Size:** 9.49 kW

- **Panels:** 26 HiA-S365HI HI Series 

- **Inverters:** SolarEdge SE7600 [240V]  

- **Cash Price:** $25,149 ($12,323 after federal and state incentives)

- **Projected First Month Generation and Offset:** 13,800 kWh, 100% 

- **Projected Payback Period:** 9.5 years

- **Price/watt:** $2.65

- **Other Information:** I was only able to upload one bill to EnergySage, whereas I sent a few to the other companies to show usage in different seasons. That may be why this installer quoted us a smaller system. But I'm very skeptical of their projected output.

personalfinance,Implications of spouse stay at home,"Hi All

Just looking for basic advice for my spouse moving from full-time to Stay-at-home for our toddler. 

Due to extremely expensive daycare in the area, lack of availability, and work costs (commute, clothing, etc) we have decided to have one of us stay home. Thankfully my income can support us, but I am trying to understand tax implications and changes I should make. Whether it be a change in withholding, 401k, etc. 

My withholding in both state and federal was 1, with theirs being 0  (it was the lesser income). This netted us to a near perfect tax liability at EOY, with child tax credit actually netting us a return. 

Now that their income has ceased at EOM May, I am trying to decide/figure out if claiming 2 would be beneficial to us. They will have worked for less than half year, but that also means we paid for child care thru that time as well. 

Please forgive me if I am leaving out critical detail. Happy to add more as needed.",finance,1655992136

economy,KB Home’s Optimistic Strategy,"Shares of KB Home (NYSE: KBH) went up 2.02% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the home building company posted positive financial earnings.

Financials: KB Home reported earnings per share of $2.32 and revenue of $1.72 billion; both were better than expected.

The Good: The operating income margin increased 410 basis points while the gross margin grew 25.3%. The net order value shot up 4% to $2.12 billion and the average selling price rose 21%.

Quote: “With our ending backlog of over $6 billion, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, which we believe we are well positioned to achieve.” - Jeffrey Mezger, Chairman, President and CEO.

Potential Problem: The company sees sales rates moderating as “buyers process the impact of higher mortgage interest rates, as well as inflationary pressures.” However, KB Home said that its built-to-order business model can help them navigate these market conditions.

Numbers: KB Home’s stock is down 39% this year. The stock reached an all-time high last spring.

Final Thoughts: It was a strong quarter for KB Home, but given the rising rate environment and a potential recession, it’s a tricky time to invest in a home builder.

personalfinance,Changed employers &amp; urgently need to fully pay 401k loan - but also dealing with credit card debt (US),"When I bought my home several years ago, I took out a 401k loan to help cover the down payment. It seemed smart at the time and I didn't expect to change employers. Fast forward to now - I've changed employers and still have $20,000 remaining on my 401k loan. I have only a few days to pay the full balance before it's considered to be an early distribution, meaning I'll have to pay taxes and the 10% fee (I am in my 30s).



Technically speaking, I do have enough money saved up to pay off this loan in full. However, if I do pay it in full, I will have essentially depleted my savings account and also deferred my plans to pay off a significant amount of credit card debt - approximately $20,000. This debt was mostly in the form of a balance transfer and, thus, I've not been paying high interest rates…but the standard rate is now in effect, so this is regular credit card debt now (i.e., approximately 16% APR).


As my take home pay has increased with my job change, I will be able to pay off debts one way or the other, hopefully by the end of this calendar year. Does it make sense to just suck it up and pay off the loan? For my own psychological reasons, I was very much excited to pay off all of the credit card debt (and was wrongly thinking I could just continue to make monthly payments on the 401k loan...), but I need some advice on what makes the most fiscal sense here.


Any other relevant details I can provide? Any thoughts? Thanks so much.",finance,1655998163
politics,"Megathread: Supreme Court Strikes New York Gun Law, Expanding Gun Rights","The Supreme Court said Thursday that Americans have a right to carry guns in public, a major expansion of gun rights.

The justices’ 6-3 decision follows a series of recent mass shootings and is expected to ultimately allow more people to legally carry guns on the streets of the nation’s largest cities — including New York, Los Angeles and Boston — and elsewhere. About a quarter of the U.S. population lives in states expected to be affected by the ruling, the high court’s first major gun decision in more than a decade.

personalfinance,Home Buying Timeline Questions,"Like everyone knows, housing is crazy with now and interest rates continue to rise. Given the current housing market, my wife and I are having trouble determining what might be the best course of action. I know trying to ""time the market"" is a fool's errand. We would like to buy our first home and we will be able to have 20% for a down payment within the next 6-8 months while not clearing out our savings. The area we are looking to buy is an area we would like to be for at least 5 years and most likely homes are selling for over asking price. We would be able to afford the mortgage payments and they would be manageable in our budget. We trying to navigate our desire for a home while still being financially responsible and have the following questions:

Does the general rule of buying a home when the plan to stay in an area for at least 5 years still apply with homes being overpriced/overvalued right now and with increased interest rates (with more increases projected)?

Are there scenarios or other things to consider that might make continuing to rent while the houses continue to be overpriced and interest rates are high?

We are both stressed that we want to make a good/responsible decision and are conflicted given the market, our wants, and our needs. Any advice is welcome and appreciated!",finance,1655998737

economy,Inflation &gt; Interest,"Hi, this is a basic question from a physician.

So long as the inflation rate is greater than the interest rate isn't it prudent to go take out the largest loans you can find? If I take a million dollar mortgage with an interest rate of 20% and inflation is 21% I'm making money owning the house, right?

And so long as everyone can make money by taking out debt surely inflation only goes higher?

So don't interest rates have to go higher than inflation rates to lower inflation ipso facto?

I assumed the geniuses at the central bank must know something I don't but lately I'm less confident on this point.  


EDIT: I think people might be misunderstanding my point. I'm not encouraging people to go take the largest loan they can find. I'm wondering whether we won't have to see interest at or around the inflation rate (i.e. 7%) in the near future.",finance,1655999526

CryptoCurrency,"I love busting myths and calling out misconceptions. This week, I'm shedding some light on the narrative that Bitcoin's bull market was triggered and fueled entirely by stimulus checks.","On the surface, this theory makes a lot of sense, and I was a big believer myself that logic would dictate that extra liquidity could be what carries a bull market, maybe even be the sole cause.

Until I actually looked at the data.

While there was indisputably some positive effect of having extra cash on the market, numbers showed that the effect wasn't as big as you would expect. Nor was it even what triggered the bull market.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why wouldn't over $5 Trillion of extra cash not have a profound impact on Bitcoin and the crypto market?

Keep in mind, the full $5 Trillion didn't go into stimulus checks, much less into crypto.

Only $1.8T went to individuals.

The rest went to healthcare, local government, airline industry, businesses, etc...

Something that would maybe still help stocks more, but not so much crypto  (at the time, the correlation to stocks still wasn't strong, around 0.4-0.5).

Even the $1.8T didn't all go to stimulus checks. A big part went to Child tax credits, SNAP, unemployment, retirement.

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html)

$817B went to stimulus checks.

&amp;#x200B;

# What percentage of the stimulus checks actually went into crypto?

According to Mizuho research, about 10% of stimulus recipient planned on investing their check in stocks or crypto.

[https://www.yahoo.com/video/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html](https://www.yahoo.com/video/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html)

Mizuho has estimated that the amount used from stimulus check would only have added about a 2-3% to the market value of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

# What was happening to Bitcoin before Covid, and did Covid and Fed printing trigger the bull run?

One of the first problems I ran into with this theory, is Bitcoin was already at the beginning of a bull market, and had already made its turning point, before any of the stimulus checks, or before Covid became a big world issue.

&amp;#x200B;

[Turning point for Bitcoin, beginning of bull market, and Covid interruption](https://preview.redd.it/aazxmafqge791.jpg?width=1788&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=111c221e82f6d7859d354c3d58de342b33dd7a97)

Stimulus checks didn't trigger the bull market.

The bearish and selling pressure had already been exhausted, already reverted to bullish and buying pressure, already had a breakout, and already had its first parabolic run to $13K. Which had already corrected, and the resuming bull trend got interrupted with the Covid crash.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# The actual timeline of the stimulus checks versus the price of Bitcoin.

In the following chart are the zones where the stimulus started to hit people's accounts.

Direct deposits are yellow, mailed checks are orange.

It's in ""zones"" because not everyone got their checks instantly or at the same time. There were also waves, delays, etc...

Keep in mind, there would likely be additional time between the time those funds are received, and the time they can actually be traded on an exchange, especially if they have to open their first account.

&amp;#x200B;

[First stimulus check distribution](https://preview.redd.it/tpxt0245he791.jpg?width=1541&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3f51200f2bfb45246c73a66930c0db3e24de6c6)

All 3 distributions are followed by a downtrend.

The difference is in the 3rd distribution, there is crabbing throughout most of the distribution, followed by a crash.

&amp;#x200B;

# Research has found that the stimulus checks may have only affected Bitcoin trading by an estimated 3.8%

According to the research done about stimulus checks, by the Federal Reserve Bank, only 0.02% of all the Cares Act fund distributed went into Bitcoin, with only an estimated 3.8% increase in trading resulting from the stimulus money.

[https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2021-working-papers/wp-2113-impact-of-covid19-stimulus-checks-on-retail-trading-in-bitcoin.aspx](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2021-working-papers/wp-2113-impact-of-covid19-stimulus-checks-on-retail-trading-in-bitcoin.aspx)

3.8% is still impactful, but probably nowhere near as high as people would have expected. Much less the source of the majority of the trading.

&amp;#x200B;

# The true effect of the stimulus checks.

The stimulus checks still had some effect.

But not so much in creating or increasing the bull market, but in compensating and decreasing the negative macros and fears of the Covid crisis.

The market was in high fear of businesses closing, and going into a bear market.

The stimulus checks wiped out a lot of that fear.

The effect didn't come so much from the stimulus checks going into crypto, as the data shows, but came more in a psychological way in wiping out the fear of a bear market from the Covid crisis, just enough to allow the crypto bull market to resume.

The stimulus check didn't add much money or liquidity to crytpo, but it kept average Joe from running out of money, and removed the pitfall of Covid, to allow the crypto bull market to continue to run free and unimpeded.",cryptocurrency,1656004158

&amp;#x200B;

I have left that account and never really worried about it but am starting a new FED job and decided to look back into it. Given the following,  ""The most current expense ratios on TSP.gov show the S fund has the highest at 0.068%, the C fund is at 0.051%, and the G fund is now 0.049%""

You can certainly find SP500 ETF's with less than a 0.051% expense, Small caps less than 0.068% etc. so wouldn't I be better rolling it into something self directed and just buying the indexes my self directly? Seems like highway robbery of a contract if you ask me, but given Black Rock runs the TSP anyways you'd think their index funds would be at least inline with market rates/ their own public ETF rates (.03% on SP500 index IVV for example) but why wouldn't they charge significantly more on a FED contract if they can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, seems to me assuming the TSP is as good or better than other products out there is history and investors should likely move funds into equivalent instruments on the market.

25 years old, work in corporate finance with a salary of 85k.

Live with my parents, only bills are $400 private student loan, $125 federal student loan when they start back up, and $150 car insurance. Plus any gasoline costs.

I am Thinking of changing careers, as I am not fulfilled and am slowly becoming resentful towards my work. No motivation, drive, or passion to do what I do.

I’ve been thinking of going to flight school, which costs a staggering 92k. Timeline is 7 months training, coming out with about 300 hours. From there you build hours through odd jobs or being an instructor. To get to the 1500 hour mark, which is needed for the airlines, it’ll be about 2 years from zero experience. 

During the 300 to 1500 hour range, earnings are limited, likely only 30-40k.

After hitting the 1500 hour mark, you can get on with a regional and get bonuses for sign on/ratings as the pilot shortage is worsening long term. Plus the flight hour rates are pretty good with a minimum of 70-75 guaranteed.



I have 20k cash in the bank, as well as 20k in a taxable brokerage account. I have a good amount saved for retirement in IRA’s and a current 401k, but don’t plan to touch those.

Can I realistically afford to essentially take a hiatus from earning what I do for 2 years to get to the airline level? 92k is a lot and the bonuses I’d get before turning 30 would cover maybe 40% of that after tax (I am using envoy air cadet schedule as a basis but many airlines have similar programs currently).


My biggest concern is going 7 months with zero income, and then about 1.5 years of low income until getting the hours I need. Though if I went back to grad school, I’m likely looking at 1-2 years low or no income, and a total cost of 45-80k as well.

Now, here are 2 economic principles that you have to ignore to say that Biden isn't responsible for inflation:

1. Large open economies (The U.S., China, etc.) effect the world economy as a whole
2. Expectations about future supply affect current prices

We know principle #1 is true because we see a relationship in graphical models using Macroeconomic Theory. We can graph changes in the world interest rate when a large open economy changes theirs.

We know principle #2 is true because of historical data and concepts like ""determinants"".

stocks,"Snap stock analysis and valuation - The king of storytelling, hype, and uncertainty ($SNAP)","Snap ($SNAP) is one of the companies that have a terrible performance as a public company, down 50% since its IPO back in March 2017 (first trading day closing at $27/share, today at around $13).

Most of the time as a public company, the price fluctuated between $5 and $25. Until the last quarter of 2021. The price started to increase and got to over $80/share in less than a year. Since then, the price is down over 80%.

This post has two goals:  
1. Explain what is Snap, how it makes money, and what contributed to this crazy share price movement.

2. Provide an analysis of the company's financials and valuation.

***Let's get started!***

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Snap?**

If you take a look at their annual report, the company is being described as a ""camera company"". In my opinion, this is misleading as Snap is not manufacturing and selling cameras. They explicitly state that they generate substantially all of the revenue from advertising. My definition is a bit different, ""*Snap is a social media company that makes money selling ads*"".

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Snap make money?**

There's a simple formula that can be applied to every social media company that has the advertising model as a main source of revenue.

Revenue = *# of users* multiplied by *ARPU (Average revenue per user)*

Having this in mind, Snap can grow only by increasing the # of users and/or increasing the ARPU.

&amp;#x200B;

**The # of users**

There are two events that I believe are relevant to mention when it comes to this metric:

1. The IPO - If we take a look at the growth of DAU (Daily active users) on the platform, at the point of IPO, Snap had a great history and a great story. Storytelling is very important when raising funds. The # of users grew from 50m in Q1/2014 to over 150m in Q1/2017. However, after the IPO, for the next 3 years (up until the end of 2019), they added roughly 50m. Not only did they have slower growth than before, but there were quarters when the # of DAU declined.
2. The pandemic - The # of DAU started growing again around this period, but the share price didn't start increasing until Q4/2020. Why? The answer is simple. Whenever there's an external event that brings new users, there's always doubt that these users will leave the platform once that event is over. However, as time went by, it was clear that the new Snap members were there to stay and this number kept increasing. So the share price went up and up and up... 

However, growth has limits. There's a limit to the # of users a platform can bring, as well as, a limit on the average revenue per user.

In 5 markets (US, UK, Australia, France, Netherlands), the company has incredibly high penetration. By this, I mean 90% of the 13-24-year-olds are on the platform and 75% of the 13-34 year-olds. I find these numbers sad as I am not a big fan of social media and the impact it has on society, but I won't go there as this post is purely intended for Snap as a company.

So growing the # of users is difficult in their most valuable markets. They'll have to wait until more children become teenagers and join the platform. Therefore, a large part of the future growth lies in expansion internationally and increasing the ARPU which could be challenging in this environment.

The high growth of the last 2 years is again declining and the momentum shifted. The share price declined from $80+ to today's $13. 

As one of the most famous investors, Eminem mentioned in his most popular song ""Lose Yourself"" - Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Snap's big bet?**

One of the areas where Snap seems to be ahead is AR (Augmented reality, not accounts receivable). Over 250m of users engage with AR per day on average. This is definitely huge. If we take into account that the users play with AR lenses over 6b times per day on average, well, we can easily calculate the average per user. The engagement is quite high.  

So what is this actually? One simple example is trying to see how certain shoes look on you. Instead of going to the store, Snap has the technology to convert a 2D image to 3D and allow you to see the outcome through the camera. Of course, this application is not limited to shoes or clothes, but it is a simple example to understand the technology.

However, they are not alone. Metaverse is one of Facebook's big bets, so they are facing competition in this area.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growing through acquisitions**

Snap has done numerous acquisitions over the last 7 years. Although this is always a risky strategy as there's no certainty the company will fit well in the existing environment, it is very difficult to judge whether these acquisitions are successful or not. The companies that have been acquired are in this industry and are expected to add new features or improve the user's experience, but it cannot be measured whether they are a good investment or not as they become part of the Snapchat application. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The real decision-makers**

Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are the two most important people in this company. Not only because they have high management positions, but because they control over 99% of the voting power in the company. No, they don't own over 99% of all the shares. Here's why. Snap has 3 types of shares:

Class A - publicly traded, these are the ones that we can all buy but have 0 voting rights.

Class B - not publicly traded, have 1 voting right per share

Class C - not publicly traded, have 10 voting rights per share.

You might be wondering, well, if I buy 1 share or 1000, even if I had voting rights, it would've made no difference. Why should I be interested in this? Lack of control is being priced at the share price. Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a large institutional investor is deciding between investing in company A and company B, both being exactly the same, except company B's shares, have no voting power. They would only invest in company B's shares over company A's shares, only if they are cheaper. The big-name investors want to have the ability to influence the direction of the company. The discount for lack of control is between 10-20%. In my valuation, I'm using DCF as if the shares have voting rights and I'm subtracting 15% of it at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The company's revenue is growing significantly, from $1.2b in 2018 to $4.4b in the last twelve months (ending Q1/2022).

At the same time, gross margin improved from 32% to 60%, and all the operating expenses reduced as a % of revenue:

\- R&amp;D from 65% to 38%

\- Sales &amp; Marketing from 34% to 20%

\- General &amp; Administrative from 40% to 17%

Hence, the operating margin improved from -107% to -15%.

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

Snap is not a capital-intensive company, the largest expenses are related to its employees and the balance sheet is fairly simple to follow.

On the asset side, out of the $9b, $5b is related to cash and short-term investment. This has increased significantly, from $1.2b at the end of 2018. 

Where did this cash come from? It came mainly from debt as their long-term loans increased to almost $4b.

Having a high cash position is good to reduce the risk of bankruptcy for money-losing companies. However, Snap is not losing money (if we exclude the share-based compensation) and there will be pressure to put the $5b in use. It is likely that we see another acquisition coming soon.

The level of debt is at an acceptable level, especially if we take into account that the interest rate was very low when they increased the debt. In my opinion, this was a great decision by the management team.

&amp;#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value. The assumptions are listed below:

**Revenue growth:** 15% for the next 12 months, followed by 20% in the 4 years after that and declining over time to 3.41%.

**Operating margin**: To improve over time, reach 9% in year 5 and 25% as of year 8.

**Discount rate**: Currently 8.3%, increasing to 10.3% over time (as the FED is raising the interest rate)

**Discount due to lack of control/voting power**: 15%

**Outcome**: $9.11/share

\*Note: In the DCF calculation, the outstanding equity options are also taken into account.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions stated above, the revenue will grow by 280% to $16.8b in the next 10 years and the target operating margin is 25%.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) changes based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|200% ($13.3b)|$5.4|$7.3|$9.1|
|280% ($16.8b)|$6.8|$9.1|$11.4|
|350% ($19.8b)|$8.0|$10.7|$13.4|
|550% ($28.6b)|$11.5|$15.3|$19.1|

There's a lot of uncertainty ahead of Snap and its success depends on many variables. At the current level, it can also be an interesting acquisition target by the larger companies.

personalfinance,"After 6 months, mortgage still hasn't closed for a tiny amount.","My wife and I are trying to buy her grandfather's house so he can retire, and we finally get a house. He wants $85k for it, and we are doing a gift of equity (so $106,250 sale price).

Our household income is around $160k after taxes (I am a business owner, so that is roughly 70% W2 and 30% K1). We currently rent an apartment for $2684/mo. And I service our debt ($15k) trying to keep cash reserves ($45k) high for the coming storm.

I reached out to a handful of banks in January, and were turned down by all but one because of how small the mortgage is. We met with a banker from that bank and told her our story including how much debt and the tax bill ($8k federal, $2k state) coming due in a couple of months.

We followed the other banker's advice to the T. We have a little bit of credit card debt ($15k) and had a tax bill of $8k. Both of which she told us to NOT pay because the massive debit would look bad in underwriting. So we applied for payment plans, and continue to pay $1k/mo toward the credit card debt. We gave her every document she ever asked for (3 years tax returns, 60 days of pay stubs, 120 days of bank/broker statements, retirement accounts, rent proof, etc.)

We were told this would take about a month to close, and if she needed anything else she would be in contact. I reached out multiple times a week asking what more I needed to provide since I hadn't heard anything and neither had grandpa. I called and emailed, and would only get a response every few weeks.

After 4 months of nothing (now we are in May 2022), I found out that the woman I had been working for had been on and off short term disability. Interest rates have obviously skyrocketed since we started this. She never let us know, and in fact, another banker had reached out saying they were going to take over our lead, but they couldn't find any documents or a loan application, so she was going to reach out to the previous banker and ask about that. The next day, our original banker took the lead back, and radio silence again.

Fast forward another 2 months, and we fought to get with the new banker, and after a 2 week tug-of-war she was able to take over our lead, only to inform us that we were ONLY a lead. We never had an application filled out, a buy/sell contract, and nothing we supplied had ever been uploaded into the system. We hadn't even gotten a pre approval yet.

Fast forward another week. We are finally in the system, have a load number, have all of our documents uploaded, but we are getting push back because of the advice we followed from the original banker. Now I'm having to write dozens of letters of explanation for why I didn't pay my taxes, why our credit card debt is so high, proving I don't own the house I rented for less than a year, explaining why I had an abnormally high K1 in 2021 vs 2020 and a slightly lower w2 for the same period, explaining why the rental amount I pay is higher than the lease agreement, etc., etc.

I don't understand why there is so much more due-diligence on a house (which is an ""appreciable asset"") vs a new truck which loses more than half its value within a year. And is there anything I'm able to do to recover the nearly 7 months of interest rate increases?",finance,1656020475

I was initially under the impression that if I made extra payments it would reduce my monthly payment after that. But my loan officer just told me no it wouldn't. I could do a recalculation once (without refinancing) to reduce the rate but I should only do it if I made a significant amount of extra payment. 

So, what then is the point of making extra payments (if I don't recalculate)? I'm still paying the same interest rate amount by the end no?

personalfinance,Evaluating Cash-out refinancing a car at a low rate,"TL;DR:Should I consider taking a cash-out refinance against the vehicle I own for no reason more than the rate is low and I could presumably do something with that money more valuable than the rate I'm being charged?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 2019 Honda Insight with around 11K miles on it that I own outright.

I saved up and paid for it new in cash for a little over $25K out the door as I didn't like the idea of financing at the time. But because of that I never bothered to understand what kind of financing I could have qualified for.

I've recently started banking with a credit union who I've asked about their loan products and they have what seems to be a really good cash out refinance product that I'm wondering if it makes sense to take advantage of.

They said they would be able to value the car at pretty close to how much I first bought it for, that is 25K, and they could give me up to 1.5x the value of the vehicle in the loan.However, they said I could qualify for a rate discount if I borrow under 80% of the assessed value of the vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

||Maximum (150%) Loan|Discounted (80%) Loan|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Term|36 months|36 months|
|Loan Amount|\~$20,000|\~$37,500|
|Interest Rate|2.19%|1.94%|
|Fees (titling fee both when opening and closing the account)|$71 x 2 = $142|$71 x 2 = $142|

So I should be able to afford the monthly payments on either loan (at the max or reduced amount).

The crux of the question for me though is that I don't have an immediate need for that money. I'd essentially be doing what I'd do with any windfall - investing it, and then paying off the principal and interest over 3 years.

At that point if it makes sense to do at all, I'd also need to figure out if it made sense to take out the larger loan amount.",finance,1656023483
personalfinance,Worth Refinancing to get out of FHA Loan even with Higher Interest Rates?,"Not sure if this is the right place to put this so I apologize in advance. I've just always loved the advice r/personalfinance gives and y'all have helped me get out of some tough binds :)

I was fortunate enough to buy my first home back in 2020 right as interest rates were low. However, I was still in the process of rebuilding my credit so I had to go with an FHA loan. Still managed to secure an interest rate of 2.75% and bought the house in September of that year. My original goal was to refinance in a year to a conventional loan so I wouldn't need to deal with the extra cost of FHA mortgage insurance and lower my monthly payments. However, life got in the way and though I was still making good enough money to refinance I had to use my extra income to support family who were falling on hard times due to the pandemic.

Fast forward to now and I'm finally in a position where I can support them AND refinance, however now interest rates have almost doubled and it seems like they're only going to get higher in the coming months.

I've looked at a few mortgage refinance estimates and despite having good credit and high enough income, plus the value of my house nearly doubling, my monthly payment might end up about the same or possibly higher than what I'm currently paying. So that begs the question, is it even worth refinancing at this time or should I stick with the FHA loan I already have with the lower interest rate?

I’m (35F) completely over living with shared walls and would like to purchase a single family home. My work has turned largely into WFH and some people are just unbelievably inconsiderate with noise, plus kids, dogs, etc. I’m just done. I’ve been thinking this for a while but no way could I afford a mortgage plus my expenses. 

I also inherited a horse recently and don’t have the heart to sell them as their owner (friend) was heartbroken in giving them away. It’s not been a joke on my finances. I do take lessons and I’m very loathe to cut back on them as it’s a great way for me to let off steam but I do have that to fall back on.

I don’t have a lot of savings due to poor life choices in my 20s (I know you probably read that horse paragraph with either an eye roll or raised eyebrows or both but my 20s were worse) and working low paying jobs for years. I do have a nice chunk of debt. 

I’m about $7k in debt on my credit cards (16% utilization). My cat became very sick a couple of months ago so 4k of the 7k is directly related to that. The remaining 2k comes from a family trip where I paid my mothers way so she could see her grandkids (my nieces and nephews). 

$49k student loans

$10.5k remaining balance for my car. 

Net income is about 4,750/month.

Bonus of 2.2k net coming in October

Current expenses are:

Rent: 1,390. This will go up to either 1,670 or 1,620 come August. I live on the very outskirts of my city and it’s about as cheap as I can go with my income - places with less rent are income restricted. Moving closer to work will result in 2-3k/month for rent.

Car payment: 304 required, I pay 360 usually. Paid ahead.

Car insurance: I pay 6 months upfront at about 700/6 months. My employer requires we keep a minimum amount of insurance. I switched providers back in April for a better price. I don’t even really factor this into my budget and just consider this credit card debt when it comes due.

Board: 575 per month for the horse. This includes feed.

Training: Horse wasn’t well trained so I pay 320/month to turn them into an upstanding citizen. It’s been working. Horse isn’t well behaved enough to lease out. 

Lessons: 320/month. 80 per lesson, usually 4/month.

Student loan: one of my federal loans was sold to a private lender so I have to pay 94/month on that one. My others are frozen atm but those will cost me out of pocket about 150/month when they resume. My employer pays 100/month toward that loan.

Food: I spend about 80/week on groceries and eat out maybe 1-2x per week at about 20/meal

Internet: 65/month. Can’t find the same reliability cheaper.

No phone bill.

Gas: lol. I fill up about 1x/week at $40-50 right now.

Utilities: Water is paid through rent (85 flat rate) and I have a healthy credit built up for electric. I usually toss 50-100 toward electric. 

Credit cards: 100/month on one, 250/month on another, and 500/month toward my higher balance card that also earns cash back on payments . These are more than minimum payments.

With the bonus I’ll have about 16k toward a down payment without totally wiping out my savings (but pretty close). Houses where I’m looking, which would be closer to the office AND the barn, run 250-300k so on the low end so I have about 5% for a down payment. I have a pretty good credit score - the credit cards dinged me a bit and dropped me below 800 on a couple of charts (depends who you ask). 

Being a 1st time homebuyer I know 5% is less than ideal and im tempted to sign for the 10 month lease so *maybe* I can save a *little* more but with this market I have no idea what to think. My expenses are such that I can’t shuck 1k/month into savings. If interest rates go above 7% and the housing market here doesn’t cool by a lot then I’ll likely be priced out altogether. Or, if my savings go splat from a recession. Should I take the 10 month lease and risk it??",finance,1656025138

I’m starting my junior year at a state school in my state, and I have enough financial aid to be able to graduate without taking any loans out if I stay home, however, my at home living situation is horrible for my mental health and emotional safety. For the sake of being able to be more successful in school, I decided to move into an off-campus house where the rent is about $650 with utilities included. Now here is my issue, because of my abusive parents, I had to take out loans to finish up my community college degree which back then I didn’t realize how bad of a financial decision this was. I used my mom’s information to co-sign the loan and it’s now like $27000 from Sallie Mae with a 13% interest rate (again, I didn’t realize how horrible this was.) My credit isn’t the best, and I don’t want to take out a loan for a car, so moving out to the house would make more sense for me since there is a bus line that takes 20 minutes to go from school to work. However, I’m second guessing my decision to move out. Even though my mental and emotional health won’t be safe, I kind of want to stay home and pay off the Sallie Mae debt while in school. If I stay home though, I will definitely need to buy a car. My long term career goal is to go to medical school so I will inevitably have a lot of student loan debt regardless, but Sallie Mae is a notoriously predatory lender, and my mom’s name is attached to the loan. I don’t want the interest to keep racking up in the next 10-15 years because I do plan on taking some time off between undergrad and med school.

Is there a stock as ridiculously underpriced as Citi (C)? Before the 2007-2008 crisis, Citi was trading at around $500/share and then abruptly crashed down to prices as low as $15/share before moderately rebounding to around $40/share in late 2009. Since 2009, Citi has been trading within the range of $40-$80/share despite enormous growth in the company's financials. Citi currently trades at roughly $50/share despite yielding annual free cash flows (FCFs) which are far, far, far greater than they ever did when its stock price was roughly $500/share. They had FCFs of \~$57 billion in 2021! And the 2022 Q1 report makes the rest of the year look extremely promising. If you took their Q1 2022 Net Income, ""extrapolated"" that figure for the entirety of 2022 by multiplying it by 4, and assumed the same Net Income/Free Cash Flow ratio as seen in 2021, you'd get a FCF number equal to around $44 billion! Both their actual 2021 FCF figure and this 2022 estimate are drastic improvements from prior years. But keep in mind that this ""back-of-the-envelope"" estimation calculation is most likely an underestimation for one big reason:

**RISING INTEREST RATES**

Banks make more money when interest rates rise. The Fed is raising and will continue to raise interest rates to recent records to combat the recent bout of inflation. Banks such as Citi stand to gain enormously from this.

Yet for some reason, the Fed's announcement of interest rate hikes in March barely had an effect on Citi's stock.

EDIT: Additionally, Warren Buffett recently invested an enormous amount in Citi, but that had very little effect on its stock price.

Every single DCF model I've seen of Citi yield Equity/Share values that are far, far, far higher than what the stock is currently trading for. Analysts widely seem to agree that Citi is undervalued and has been for several years.

Just for fun, I took the Free Cash Flows generated by Citi from 1989-2021 and used the Excel forecast function to use that data to create a forecast for the next 10 years within a 95% confidence interval. Thereafter, I took those FCF forecasts and used the ""terminal value"" method to come up with a NPV Enterprise value for the company (assuming a 5.5% WACC, as calculated by valueinvesting.io). I took this figure and subtracted the company's net debt to arrive at an equity value for the company. Afterward, I divided this equity value and divided it by Citi's shares outstanding. This is essentially how DCF models calculate a stock's ""intrinsic"" price. I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$254.68/share.**

But that's not all! I also did the same thing but used the FCF forecasts from the Lower Confidence Bound (meaning Excel is 95% sure that the actual values will be higher than these values). Thereafter, I averaged the results from the median forecast and the worst-case scenario (as it is extremely unlikely that Citi will actually yield FCF of around -$35 billion for every single year for the next 10 years). Averaging the median forecasts and the worst-case forecasts, I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$56.55/share**! Keep in mind that this is basically the most realistic **worst-case scenario** for Citi's future FCFs.

**Citi is currently trading at $46.35/share.**

I've done tons of DCF models and my ""intrinsic value"" figure always ends up being pretty close to the actual stock price. This is virtually the only exception. How on Earth is Citi only trading at $46.35/share!? How is that even possible!? Why isn't the stock price soaring?",finance,1656030497

My estimated costs for school are roughly 13K with rent for my first year plus food and any extra bills such as gas and unforeseen circumstances. By the time I'm attending school, I should have 35K(ish) in the bank which is more than enough to get by with the assistance of my parents without needed any of the loan money. 

In terms of student loans, I have been accepted for 12K for my first year which I would get in the form of a lump sum in 4-6 weeks. The question now is if I should take the loan or not. My thinking is that I take this money that I know I can survive without and invest it in a 4-year GIC which would expire as I'm leaving my final year. 

The student loan does not charge interest until 6 months after my final year meaning I have 4 years' worth of interest-free money to use. Currently, I can buy a 4-year GIC with a rate of 4.45% which will potentially go up with the recent and upcoming interest rate increases, which would net me $2,655.07. The benefit of the loan is that I can also pay it off in its entirety in one lump sum with the principal amount as soon as the GIC matures and payments start. I can repeat this every year as long as I know I will not need the loan money to live off.

74. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
75. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network.

77. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources.

economy,"Economy stands firm, teeth fall out","The Kremlin is now jubilant that the Russian economy has turned out to be more resilient than expected in the West. Yes, restrictions have negative consequences, but the government copes with them at its own macroeconomic level. For example, did the West impose sanctions on gold and diamonds mined in Russia? It doesn't matter - they will be sold at a discount to Latin American countries or Arab sheikhs.

However, despite the advances in macroeconomic reports, everyday life is getting harder for the population. The main surprise was that in Russia there were big problems with imported goods, which are in no way connected with the restrictive measures against the Putin regime in general and the war with Ukraine in particular. So, no one forced more than one thousand foreign companies to leave the Russian market, but they themselves decided to boycott Russia. In addition, a huge number of imported products disappeared not as a result of direct sanctions, but due to the disruption of logistics routes and supply chains.

No one in the West has banned the supply of products for dentistry to the Russian Federation - filling material, impression material, cement for fillings and fixing crowns, implants, suture materials, metal for crowns, antiseptics ... However, all this disappeared from the market. Russian dental clinics hope to gain access to all of the abovementioned, either through parallel imports through friendly countries, or through illegal smuggling. In both cases, the prices for all materials increase many times over. Dentists do not have time to change and print new prices. After three months of ""special operation Z"", the prices for the treatment of caries, pulpitis and other common services have already increased by 75%. So, a complete treatment of a tooth with one root will cost 12 thousand rubles, and the treatment of pulpitis now costs from 20 thousand rubbles. By the beginning of winter, prices are guaranteed to double (that is, by 100%). What will happen next - no one knows. 

Theoretically, it is possible to work with domestic analogues, but doctors diligently avoid this. For example, there is no gutta-percha and dental silicone in the Russian Federation. And what is there - impression material, cements, filling materials, composite, anaesthetics - are of terrible quality. Naturally, certain hopes are pinned on China, but it is not known whether they will come true. In addition, even if stable supplies from China are established, prices will still increase. After all, in addition to more expensive materials, there is such an important factor as the salary of employees: doctors, technicians, assistants, administrators, accountants, cleaners. Given that literally everything has risen in price, clinics will be forced to raise staff salaries.

But that's not all: from 90% to 100% of the equipment in dental offices is imported. Mostly German, Italian, American and Japanese. The equipment that could be supplied by China is not yet certified. But even already purchased and successfully operating equipment requires maintenance, repair, replacement of components. It is not clear how to deal with all this tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

Of course, no one conspired against Russian dentists. It's just that foreign producers don't want to have anything to do with the Russian state as a whole. Today Russia is dropping out of the world civilized community in the same way as a rotten tooth falls out of the mouth.",finance,1656062442

solar,"Vivint - Freedom Forever Solar Quote - Houston, TX with Tesla 400H &amp; Enphase IQ8+","Received few quotes from several solar companies. Cash offers looks much better than financing, but this quote from Vivint - Freedom Forever $105/month (after incentives) for 25 years @1.49% feels much better and easy to handle payments (similar to paying electric bill monthly). Their cash offer was $19,740 (after incentives). 

10.80 KW System

16000 kwh production

Cash: 
$26,676 before incentives 
$6,940 federal incentive 
$19,740 after incentives

Per Watt Calc - Cash deal:
$26,676 / 10,800 kw = $2.47/Watt

Financing:
$34,921.25 before incentive
$9,079.54 federal incentive
$25,841.72 Total after incentives
$105/month in 25 year installments

Per Watt Calc - Financing deal:
105 installments * 300 months = $31,500 + $9080 (Federal rebate payback) = $40,580 / 10,800kw = $3.757/Watt

Couldn't find REC panels in stock from anyone and Sun Power requoted and showed me a cost difference of $10k over my other quotes (feels super expensive). So, I felt Tesla panels might be better off as they probably will still be in business for the next 25 years vs other panel manufacturers. 

I went ahead and actually signed the contract last night (can be canceled in 3 days). But, later after signing I thought if I made a better decision, especially because 

Tesla shows conflicting information on their panel warranty exclusions(point below) list and I am still waiting for the warranty documents from Vivint (they mentioned that the they'll provide me equipment warranty docs after signing), showing that Vivint - Freedom Forever are their authorized installers and warranty is still applicable. 

Tesla Panel General Exclusions:

This Limited Warranty does not apply to any breach of this Limited Warranty directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from any of the following:

(viii) someone other than Tesla installing, removing, re-installing or repairing the Modules (including, but not limited to, damaging the Modules during such work).

Any suggestions on this please? 

Making sure that all is well in the first 3 days (official time to cancel this contract), even though Vivint mentioned that I should be able to cancel this anytime before installation.

personalfinance,Help with Nelnet encouraging me to consolidate federally,"Hey guys,

Maybe someone can help out.

I have two federal Direct loans that have been on IBR for a very long time.  I've been re-certifying IBR for these loans every year for a very long time, and have over 150+ payments toward the IBR plan forgiveness.

Recently, someone at Nelnet (who seemed very knowledgeable and forthright), convinced me that it would be a good idea to re-consolidate these loans so that I can take advantage of COVID19 forbearance available through federal consolidated Direct loans.

This Nelnet agent assured me that I would NOT LOSE all my payment history that counts toward ultimate forgiveness, and assured me this is a recent change that I should take advantage of.

However, in my own research, I'm not finding any info other than warnings that re-consolidation may result in loss of IBR payment history, resetting my payments-needed-for-forgiveness to zero.

So I'm extremely hesitant and leery.  I'm not a very trustful person, to begin with, when it comes to all things capitalist, and feel that corporations, like Nelnet, are only in it for profit, and do not generally have my best interests in mind.

Edit:  I should say that I don't really NEED the forbearance, I'm okay with continuing monthly payments, but was urged to participate in re-consolidation for other benefits that may come down the pipeline from the federal level, at later times.

personalfinance,Balance transfers for cc debt,"Hi everyone,

First time poster here so apologies if I don’t follow any rules or leave out any obvious info!

Reaching out with a question regarding balance transfers. Currently I am sitting on about 9k of debt on a capitalone quicksilver card, and am looking for ways to ease paying off this debt (savings are pretty much not an option, very little money saved currently. Credit took a hit recently and is at around 680,  according to credit wise).

I learned about balance transfers and am considering applying for a balance transfer card to transfer this debt to a 0% apr card (looking at the Citi Double Cash Card). I do not plan to use this card for any purchases initially, but rather just to house the debt and pay it off with the 0% interest rate.

My question for you all is, does this sound like a good course of action? I recently acquired a promotion at work, increasing my income by quite a bit (making somewhere maybe around 90k a year currently, hard to tell with bonuses) but the cc debt/interest are making it difficult for me to get my balance down.

I also wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience (in particular using this Citibank card or even transferring from the quicksilver to Citibank double cash card ). Any gotchas, general advice or recommendations of other cards would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1656077426

economy,FedEx Can't Stop the Optimism,"Shares of FedEx (NYSE: FDX) went up 2.57% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the transportation giant posted mixed financial earnings.

Financials: FedEx reported earnings per share of $6.87 and revenue of $24.4 billion; both were below estimates.

The Good: Operating income grew thanks to a positive net impact of fuel. There was also higher revenue per package at FedEx Ground and a 28% increase in revenue per shipment for FedEx Freight.

The Bad: FedEx faced lower shipment demand from slower economic growth, supply chain disruptions, higher transportation and wage rates, Covid lockdowns, and geopolitical uncertainty. Average daily volumes declined for FedEx Ground.

Outlook: The saving grace for FedEx is its strong full-year guidance, including revenue of $93.5 billion and earnings per share between $22.45 to $24.45. That was better than expected.

Numbers: FedEx is down 11% in 2022, but is up 11% in the past 30 days.

Final Thoughts: On the one hand, FedEx survived a tough quarter. On the other hand, if the economic environment worsens, what does that mean for FedEx?

Forex,Scalping - pips per day/ trading time,"We hear the risk management and risk/reward is the key in trading. 

I agree

But from what I’ve read on here, people don’t generally believe in setting pip targets. The arguments I’ve read are “take what the market gives you” and “pips don’t matter, what matters more is risk reward”

But I kind of disagree with those points

Setting targets does matter and make a difference, IMO. Yes, you can say “I want o make 50 pips today”. Will you make you target? Absolutely no clue. So I agree, just because your setting a target doesn’t mean that you will get it 

The market may be slow (ie. trading into a Fed meeting) and there might not be any set ups. 

So you have to take what you get….

So why do I think setting a pip target is important?

One word: overtrading. 

Trading is a business - it’s our job to make money and get in and get out as fast as possible. Setting a pip target is one way to avoid overtrading. If you just are trading thinking about risk- reward and take what the market gives you, you may be up 20 pips and on fire…then give away everything by overtrading.

I might not have worded this post the best. But I feel that setting pip targets is useful since you’re job is to get in and out. Make that $1000 or $250 or whatever and get the fuck out of there. 

Granted, I believe the holy grail in trading is risk for reward and risk management. But say you realise this and trading the right set-ups that look like 1:2 or 1:3 risk- reward set-ups and you’ve hit your daily target with a few good trades.. get the fuck out of there 

That said, another idea to avoid overtrading, if you don’t believe in setting pip targets, is setting specific trading hours (ie. 9-11am or anytime that suits). That way you’re focused for that specific amount of time and know when to get the fuck out of the market 

What do you prefer with the above, in terms of the strategy to avoid overtrading? You need to focus and keep your alert after all. There’s nothing worse than making a few good trades and undoing them with overtrading. 

In terms of setting pip targets, what’s your number and why?",finance,1656081923

stocks,How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?,"Is there a stock as ridiculously underpriced as Citi (C)? Before the 2007-2008 crisis, Citi was trading at around $500/share and then abruptly crashed down to prices as low as $15/share before moderately rebounding to around $40/share in late 2009. Since 2009, Citi has been trading within the range of $40-$80/share despite enormous growth in the company's financials. Citi currently trades at roughly $50/share despite yielding annual free cash flows (FCFs) which are far, far, far greater than they ever did when its stock price was roughly $500/share. They had FCFs of \~$57 billion in 2021! And the 2022 Q1 report makes the rest of the year look extremely promising. If you took their Q1 2022 Net Income, ""extrapolated"" that figure for the entirety of 2022 by multiplying it by 4, and assumed the same Net Income/Free Cash Flow ratio as seen in 2021, you'd get a FCF number equal to around $44 billion! Both their actual 2021 FCF figure and this 2022 estimate are drastic improvements from prior years. But keep in mind that this ""back-of-the-envelope"" estimation calculation is most likely an underestimation for one big reason:

**RISING INTEREST RATES**

Banks make more money when interest rates rise. The Fed is raising and will continue to raise interest rates to recent records to combat the recent bout of inflation. Banks such as Citi stand to gain enormously from this.

Yet for some reason, the Fed's announcement of interest rate hikes in March barely had an effect on Citi's stock.

EDIT: Additionally, Warren Buffett recently invested an enormous amount in Citi, but that had very little effect on its stock price.

Every single DCF model I've seen of Citi yield Equity/Share values that are far, far, far higher than what the stock is currently trading for. Analysts widely seem to agree that Citi is undervalued and has been for several years.

Just for fun, I took the Free Cash Flows generated by Citi from 1989-2021 and used the Excel forecast function on that data to create a forecast for the next 10 years within a 95% confidence interval. Thereafter, I took those FCF forecasts and used the ""terminal value"" method to come up with a NPV Enterprise value for the company (assuming a 5.5% WACC, as calculated by valueinvesting.io). I took this figure and subtracted the company's net debt to arrive at an equity value for the company. Afterward, I took this equity value and divided it by Citi's shares outstanding. This is essentially how DCF models calculate a stock's ""intrinsic"" price. I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$254.68/share.**

But that's not all! I also did the same thing but used the FCF forecasts from the Lower Confidence Bound (meaning Excel is 95% sure that the actual values will be higher than these values). Thereafter, I averaged the results from the median forecast and the worst-case scenario (as it is extremely unlikely that Citi will actually yield FCF of around -$35 billion for every single year for the next 10 years). Averaging the median forecasts and the worst-case forecasts, I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$56.55/share**! Keep in mind that this is basically the most realistic **worst-case scenario** for Citi's future FCFs.

**Citi is currently trading at $46.35/share.**

I've done tons of DCF models and my ""intrinsic value"" figure always ends up being pretty close to the actual stock price. This is virtually the only exception. How on Earth is Citi only trading at $46.35/share!? How is that even possible!? Why isn't the stock price soaring?",finance,1656091082
stocks,Rays of Sunshine - Possible positive catalysts,"Let me know what you think of these potentially positive catalysts, I'm trying to see if the logic is sound. This is all based on a theory that we at or near bottom now, without taking a recession into account.  

1. Unpopular Ukraine proxy war ending in peace. Our lawmakers and NATO miscalculated this entire idea from every aspect and the war may end sooner than later. Ukrainians got everything we have to give and still lost. War ends, markets go up, inflation goes down, potentially before Nov election.   

2. Democrats scrambling to appear to do something to help economy before mid-terms. Either they do something substantial to try to help fix the economy instead of relying on the Fed. So either they do something and the market goes up or they fail and republicans get elected and the market goes up.   

3. Possibility of a recession prompts fed to end QT.  

4. China reopens. Excuse my tin foil hat here, but I can't help but see a correlation between war in Russia and China lockdown. But when they reopen, markets go up.   

5. Rising inflation, QT, rising interest rates, looming recession, crashing market, layoffs flip market paradign to ""bad news is good news"" like in 2008-2010. Bad news will be viewed as reason for Fed/Congress to act. Markets go up with bad news.

CarMax is offering me 28k for the car, which yes I'm still in the hole ~3k but I can pay that off and not have to stress about a car payment. It would literally be 3 months of car payments that I would have to make to get rid of the negative equity.

personalfinance,Haven't received full Inheritance from dad's IRA,"My father passed away at the beginning of this year.  He had IRA accounts and my sister and I were both to receive 25% each and my stepmother would get the remaining 50%.  My dad's account was with Wells Fargo Advisors.

My sister opened account with them and had her portion of the assets transferred into the new account without any issues.  I, on the other hand, already had an account with Northwestern Mutual and opted to have the assets transferred directly into an Inherited IRA account with Northwestern.  In hindsight, I shouldn't have done that because it really seemed to complicate the process.

Anyway, I haven't received the full amount.  It's a little complicated because, since he passed they froze the account, they had to transfer the shares instead of just sending the dollar amount.  I thought with them being a banking institution and everything, this whole process would be done pretty easily still.

But they didn't send me the full amount I was entitled to.  I am able to compare it to my sisters inheritance and they are different.  I already got in touch with them a month ago and let them know and they apologized and I have since received more shares.  But it's still not the right amount.

Does anyone have any advice on what my next steps should be?  I'm kind of burned out on dealing with the person I've been talking to because they've gotten it wrong two times now and it gets more complicated every time.  Even my stepmom has had issues with this person fedexing the wrong forms to sign, I feel they're somewhat incompetent.

I'm aware the market is down and that's not the issue.  When I compare it to my sister's, the current value of the shares my sister received is $138,688.  The current value of the shares I've received is $130,073.  And these were the same stocks so it's not an issue of the market.  I just didn't receive the right amount of shares.

Another aspect is that when they do transfer, it seems to take about 2-3 weeks after talking to them before the assets arrive in my account.  Which makes it all just more of a hassle and slow process.

Any ideas on what the best course of action would be?  I'm entitled to the money so they have to give it to me right?  I just want to get what I'm entitled to and be done with it.  Any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated.",finance,1656100437

# **Quarter-end buying may lift stocks higher before the next market storm - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/quarter-end-buying-may-lift-stocks-higher-before-the-next-market-storm.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market is about to close out its worst first half in decades in the week ahead, setting the stage for a summer of uncertainty and volatility.
*****
&gt; But in the very near term, strategists see a window of positive momentum for an oversold market and say the end of the quarter could be a time for some quick gains. That period, leading up to the final trading day of the month, is when many portfolio managers shift their investments, or rebalance, to make up for the changes in the values of their stock and bond holdings.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic, for one, sees a case in which stocks could surge 7% in the week ahead, based on rebalancing alone. With the S&amp;P 500 down more than 14% for the second quarter and 17.6% for the year so far, investment managers will have to boost stock holdings to regain asset allocation levels.
*****
&gt; “Next week’s rebalance is important since equity markets were down significantly over the past month, quarter and six-month time period,” wrote Kolanovic, the firm’s chief global markets strategist. He emphasized that rebalancing activity is not usually the only driver of markets.
*****
&gt; Recent rebalances have been positive for stocks, and that could mean this one will be as well, he noted. For instance, near the end of the first quarter, the market was down about 10%, and there was a significant 7% rally in the final week heading into quarter end. The same type of move also happened in the smaller May rebalancing, when stocks rallied about 7% going into the month end after a decline of about 10%.
*****
&gt; “It is happening in a period of low liquidity. On top of that, the market is in an oversold condition, cash balances are at record levels, and recent market shorting activity reached levels not seen since 2008,” Kolanovic added.
*****
&gt; But after a rally, some strategists are already looking ahead to a choppy third quarter.
*****
&gt; “Historically, the third quarter, along with the second quarter, are the worst quarters of the 16 quarter presidential cycle,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “Once the uncertainty associated with mid-term elections has run its course, or once the third quarter has run its course, the fourth quarter as well as the next two quarters are the best of the 16-quarter presidential cycle.”
*****
&gt; According to CFRA, the S&amp;P 500 fell an average 0.5% in the third quarter in the second year of a presidential term, after an average 1.9% decline in the second quarter. In the data, going back to World War II, there was an average bounce back of 6.4% in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; The mid-term elections are in November, and many political strategists expect a shift in power toward the Republicans in Congress.
*****
&gt; Stovall said for now, the market could trade higher into the start of the earnings season. “If history repeats itself, from a timing perspective, we get a tradeable bounce now,” he said. But he added that could be followed by a washout later in the quarter, and that could ultimately bring capitulation.
*****
&gt; If the second quarter ends near its current level, it would be the worst first half for stocks since 1970. But according to Stovall, a bad first half doesn’t necessarily mean a bad year.
*****
&gt; “Of the [previous] five worst since 1929, all five were higher in the second half and gained an average of 23.7%...Of the next five, four of the five are down and the average is a decline of 7.8%,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; # Market on holiday
The week ahead of the long Fourth of July weekend looks to be fairly quiet, though there are some key economic reports. Corporations may also disclose some guidance on earnings, particularly if they expect to miss expectations in the coming reporting season.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, most important could be Thursday’s personal consumption expenditures data which includes the PCE deflator inflation reading, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; The durable good report is due out Monday. Consumer confidence and S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price data will be released Tuesday, and ISM Manufacturing Friday.
*****
&gt; “My guess is the market is trying to rally right now with bond yields coming down, and equities putting in a few decent sessions,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. “It could probably rally into the July 4th holiday, and the real show starts with the earnings season.”
*****
&gt; Major banks begin reporting earnings July 14 and 15.
*****
&gt; “By the second week of July, we will see what the tone will be with the earnings, and I would expect a much choppier market given my expectations that some of these companies will take down guidance,” said Chang. He said what’s unclear is how much of the anticipated negative news is already priced in, given the market’s already sharp decline.
*****
&gt; “Guidance is crucial,” said Quincy Krosby, LPL Financial chief equity strategist. “What the market is trying to decide is whether or not we are headed into a recession and what kind of recession...The corporations in their guidance at this crucial stage are going to tell us whether or not the market is poised for a deeper sell-off.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, and bond yields were also recovering from a steep drop off after the prior week’s sharp run up. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield topped 3.48% on June 14, slid to 3% by Thursday. It was back at 3.11% on Friday. Bond yields move opposite prices.
*****
&gt; A big source of angst for investors is whether inflation will continue to flare and drive aggressive Fed rate hikes, leading to a possible recession. The bond market this past week was reflecting some of that fear, after the Fed raised rates by 0.75 percentage point in the prior week and looks set to boost the federal funds rate by a similar magnitude in July.
*****
&gt; “It’s a narrative in overdrive. You go from inflation fears, and a 75 basis point hike... to only realize the more the Fed hikes, eventually they’re going to tip us into recession. All this in a matter of a week,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG.

&gt; # NASDAQ’s Mid-Year Rally Commences Early

&gt; In the mid-1980s as the market began to evolve into a tech-driven market and the market’s focus in early summer shifted to the outlook for second quarter earnings of technology companies. In anticipation of positive results, over the last three trading days of June and the first nine trading days in July, NASDAQ typically enjoys a rally. This 12-day run has been up 29 of the past 37 years with an average historical gain of 2.6%. This year the rally may have begun early and could last until on or around July 14.

&gt; After the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, NASDAQ’s mid-year rally had a spotty track record from 2002 until 2009 with three appearances and five no-shows in those years. However, it has been quite solid over the last twelve years, up eleven times with a single mild 0.1% loss in 2015. Last year, NASDAQ advanced a solid 2.0% during the 12-day span.

&gt; # History Repeating Itself?

&gt; With just a few days left in the quarter, equities are catching a bid, and through mid-day Friday, the S&amp;P 500 is up just about 6% from its recent low last Thursday (6/16). The bounce has a lot of investors asking whether last week's leg lower marked a capitulation point from which the market can stage a meaningful rally. A lot of investors and 401(k) accounts would most certainly welcome that type of move, but if you're starting to feel a bit like Bill Murray's character Phil Connors in the movie Groundhog Day, there's a reason.

&gt; The chart below shows the QTD performance of the S&amp;P 500 in Q1 versus Q2 of this year. In both quarters, the market started out with fleeting gains that quickly turned into steep losses with little relief throughout the quarter. The only relief in Q1 came in the second half of March when the S&amp;P 500 rallied 11% off its lows in eleven trading days. This time around, the late quarter rally took longer to materialize, but in the five trading days since last Thursday's (6/16) close, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 6% with another four trading days left to go. In order for investors to have the confidence that this current rally has more behind it, they're going to want to see more than just a late quarter rally but also some follow-through into Q3.

&gt; # 3 Reasons It Is So Bad It is Good

&gt; Summer is finally here, but 2022 is still shaping up to be one of the worst years for investors ever. That’s the bad news, the good news is the year isn’t over yet and here are three reasons the bulls shouldn’t throw in the towel just yet.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 Index is down 21% for the year, which would be the worst first half to any year since 1970,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “As bad as that has been for investors, the good news is previous years that were down at least 15% at the midway point to the year saw the final six months higher every single time, with an average return of nearly 24%.”

&gt; As the table shows below, big drops to start a year tend to see big bounces back. Although most investors probably don’t feel like that is possible in 2022, just remember history says a surprise bullish move is possible.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blog-1-2.png))**

&gt; Next, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a horrible quarter tends to see a nice snapback. Looking at previous quarters to lose at least 15%, the next two quarters stocks were higher 7 out of 7 times with an average return of more than 17%. Things get even better going out a full year, up nearly 30% on average. That is something most investors aren’t expecting right now, but we are guessing they’ll be quite happy should history repeat.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blog-2-1.png))**

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 5% back-to-back weeks, another potentially bullish development. In fact, after previous times the S&amp;P 500 fell that much, a year later it was up more than 28% on average and down only once (1987).

&gt; # Beware summer rally hype, historically the weakest of all four seasons

&gt; Most years, especially when the market sells off during the first half or is flat, prospects for the perennial summer rally become the buzz on the street. Parameters for this “rally” were defined by the late Ralph Rotnem as the lowest close in the Dow Jones Industrials in May or June to the highest close in July, August, or September. Such a big deal is made of the “summer rally” that one might get the impression the market puts on its best performance in the summertime. Nothing could be further from the truth! Not only does the market “rally” in every season of the year, but it does so with more gusto in the winter, spring, and fall than in the summer.

&gt; Winters in 59 years averaged a 13.0% gain as measured from the low in November or December to the first quarter closing high. Spring rose 11.8% followed by fall with 11.0%. Last and least was the average 9.4% “summer rally.” Even 2020’s impressive 25.2% “summer rally” was outmatched by spring’s massive 48.3%. So beware the summer rally hype as it is usually the smallest rally of the year and can fade just as quickly as it began. Following the worst weekly loss since 2020, today’s DJIA 2.1% gain likely has stirred hope that this is the start of a summer rally. More likely, today’s bounce will fade as inflation is still raging and the Fed is still tightening monetary policy.

&gt; # Tech and Small Caps Have Struggled in Midterm Year Julys

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and strong performances in 2013 and 2018 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 76, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2022).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the fourth weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.6% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f9a0f84f7459b8c202fd0fff5a043b52/ce20b00a8cfe680b-3d/s400x600/ba9e13d812dee77ad046d3fc0219c8b0cb28ec5a.jpg))**

&gt; Midterm-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #3 for DJIA and #5 S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.3% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1974) and Russell 2000 (since 1982) midterm Julys rank #12. NASDAQ has only advanced in four of the last twelve midterm Julys with an average loss of 1.9%. Russell 2000 has advanced only three in its last ten with an average decline of 3.8%.

&gt; # Sentiment Worsens... Again

&gt; Even as the ten-year yield and crude oil have pulled back over the last few trading sessions and the S&amp;P 500 has recuperated the losses from late last week, the percentage of respondents to the AAII survey considering themselves bullish fell for the third consecutive week. This week's reading of 18.2% marks the lowest level since late April and ranks in the bottom 1.3% of all weeks going back to the start of the survey in 1987. On the bright side, the rate of decline in bullish sentiment has been on the decline as the percentage of respondents that considered themselves bullish fell by 11 percentage points two weeks ago, 1.6 percentage points last week, and now just 1.2 percentage points this week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/AAII-Bullish-Sentiment-062322.png))**

&gt; The percentage of respondents reporting neutral sentiment moved modestly higher, increasing by just 30 basis points to 22.5%. Click here to learn more about Bespoke's premium stock market research service.

&gt; The percentage of respondents reporting bearish sentiment rose for the third consecutive week to 59.3%, the highest level since late April. The 4/28 reading was only 10 basis points higher than this week's, so we are near the previous peak in terms of bearish sentiment. Apart from the late April reading, bearish sentiment had not topped 59% since early March of 2009. In fact, this week's reading is in the 97th percentile of all readings since the survey began in 1987.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/AAII-bearish-sentiment-062322.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread remains near historic lows, and there have now been 22 consecutive weeks in which the spread was below -10 (smoothed out by taking a four week moving average). We are now just four weeks away from setting a new record in this regard. The previous high was in 1991 when there were 26 consecutive weeks in which the bull-bear spread was under -10. Investors often view this as a contrarian indicator, as low readings in bullish sentiment leave upside for the market should sentiment bottom out and positive news emerge.

personalfinance,"Home Purchase, should I lower debt to income?","I am starting to look at purchasing a home, and been charting out my budget and debts. I have 70k currently saved and my income is 86k a year. I am looking to spend $275k on a house in my LCOL area.

I purchased a new car in 2020 and got very lucky with 0.9% financing for 4 years, and I owe 10.5k left. Monthly payment is $445 a month.

Right now with my budget and mortgage estimates, I would be left with about $500 in savings every month (I would have 10k left in the bank for an emergency fund).

 I was considering paying off the car loan (smaller down payment) to decrease my debt to income ratio and have a bigger savings net per month ($750).

If I did not pay it off, I would probably go for 20% down and leaving myself with about 5k emergency fund. The mortgage payment would be $200 less from no PMI.

I have 20k in student loans that I have considered also paying off, but I think at the moment it would lower my down payment too much.

Would it make sense to pay off the car loan now even with the low interest rate for more savings or continue to pay off the car loan and have a lower mortgage?",finance,1656108996
personalfinance,Paying off student loans faster causing me to pay more overall?,"I was looking at the Federal Student Aid loan simulator and, according to it, with a Income-Contingent Repayment and Public Service Loan Forgiveness I would end up paying a greater total if I paid additional on top of the minimum payment... This confuses me, as I would have thought reducing the principal and paying less interest over time would result in the opposite (paying less ultimately). Can anyone explain?  

  

**edit**: In this case it seems that because PSLF forgives your remaining debt after 10 years' payments that accelerating payment is actually reducing the amount forgiven significantly",finance,1656113559
personalfinance,Rents are half the cost of a mortgage payment on same house…what’s going on?,"I’m living in Los Angeles and have been considering purchasing my first home in the next year after a significant pay bump and an inheritance. But looking around, I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around why rent prices have lagged so far behind housing prices. 

For example, the house I currently rent (just moved in 3 months ago) costs $3500/mo but is valued at around $1.3m based on comps in the area. Even when interest rates were low, a mortgage payment/taxes/insurance would be almost double my rent on this same house.

I get that renting is “throwing your money away” (it’s not really) and that a mortgage is going towards building equity…but does it make any sense to buy when renting the same home is so so much cheaper here?

btc,#30 in coinmarketcap?!,"So ETC has passed in marketcap too. Obviously things are not going well. Caribbean and South America strategy is clearly not working. At least not working as it should be. BCH is losing ground.

BCH needs capital to sustain the price. Europe, North America and Far East. Early adopter big blockers can not sustain the price with their wealth only. BTC, ETH and even low profile projects has close relations with institutions. BCH has to be in the game.

I accept that banks and institutions would invest for their own interest and custodial cryptos give them a leverage. But maybe some has different visions. We need them.

BCH is not a mere electronic cash, it is hard money. Cash and Gold. Store of value and means of exchange. Freedom and utility.

Money is broken, and BCH is the cure. FED is fighting against inflation for now but recession is on the way and eventually FED will pause and inflation will become a reality again.

No matter what I did all types of Portfolio went up at the same time during great times and the oposite when the downturns.

I’ve tried managed accounts w different risk levels. I’ve tried the vanguard common diversification, and also the choosing random stocks based on fundamentals etc.

And all go up and down about the same percent give or take a few percent points. 

Bonds and reit where mentioned as safe on certain times. 
Non USA stuff for less risk on domestic.
Large cap safe and dividend stuff for other times and so on. 

It’s just a crap shoot at this point.

If I ride all these different trends (like energy and cpu now) vs a “diversified portfolio” I’d be about the same in 10-40 years imo.

personalfinance,Help with Severance pay confusion,"Idk if this is the place to ask but reddit was my immediate go to, as i know someone knows something. My husband recently got fired from his job. He had worked a week of 37 hours at $20/hr for $740.
They told him they would give him a months severance pay coming out to 3,200. He got his check for 2,987.20. 
So this is where we got confused bc we thought it was wrong and he had contacted them and she said there would be two lines, on his pay stub. One for his weekly check and one for severance at 3200. I looked it up and realized they take a 22% tax cut for $700. 
So I was like okay that's where it went.

But I'm just thinking.. no wait so if his severance was 3200 and his check was 700 then it should have been at LEAST $3000. (I'm just doing roundabout numbers here not minusing tax from his check, which he has set to take out as LITTLE as possible. He pays full state and then pays barely anything in federal and we just pay when we do our taxes) it's about $60 taken out of his weekly checks, IF, and I wanna say that's way over. 

So $3200, his check of 740 pays the severance tax, minus the weekly pay tax according to the business equals $2,987.20???? 

She said to check his pay stubs and he just looked again and surprise, it still has not been sent. The last one he has is from the 17th. So we don't even have that to look at to try and figure out.

personalfinance,Need advice on whether it is a good idea financially to purchase a new home,"This is a semi new post.  I added a lot more information about our finances compared to the last one I submitted!

Jobs:
- Total of $180k per year gross salary.
- The total gross is not including any bonuses.  We can bank on at least a 5% bonus each year if history is correct. 
- Total of $7.5k monthly after all deductions (health insurance, 401k, HSA/FSA, ESPP, state and federal taxes).

Debts:
- No other debts besides monthly credit card debt which are paid off in full monthly.
- We have never been late on our credit card payments and our credit scores are both 780 or above.
- Around $2.4k in credit card debt in total combined. 

Investments/savings accounts:
- $120k in individual stocks/index funds.
- $7k in HSA investments.
- Max for FSA for an individual.
- $170k total in our 401k/Roth IRA accounts.
- $50k in our liquid savings accounts.

Current house:
- Bought for $460k in early 2019.
- Realtor thinks we can sell around $640k-$660k.
- Around $350k left on our mortgage loan.
- Current mortgage monthly payment is $2.3k 
including taxes and insurance in escrow.
- Utilities are around $350 a month for gas, electric and internet.
- Located in northern Massachusetts in a semi HCOL area.

Reasons we are looking for a new house:
- Child on the way, want more space for the future.
- Need more space because we both are working from home full time (a very nice to have, but not 100% necessary) 
- Want a house that is not on a slab.
- Want an area with less yard maintenance (lots of pines and leaves in the area, a lot of work each year cleaning because of the amount of debris).

What we are looking for in a new house:
- More room for offices as well as in general for the future.
- Easier maintenance for the house and outside.
- A good school system.

Right now, we are looking at houses around the $700k mark which avoids to $4k-$4.2k per month mortgage (includes insurance and taxes).  That seems to be under the rule of thumb which as far as I know is about 28% of your gross income (gross income * 0.28 / 12 months  = $4200) for the monthly payment.  Do you think that is stretching our income too much for the time being?  

We are also trying to decide if we should still look at houses because if we do, we need to get our house ready to sell as well.

personalfinance,"A portfolio with 33% Gold, 33% Silver, and 33% Platinum - all through ETFs. Reasonable or Crazy?","The thesis:

1. Inflation is becoming a bigger problem than central banks initially thought
2. Given the high level of government debt in the US and other developed countries, there is a level above which interest rates will not be allowed to go up
3. If interest rates aren't allowed to go up beyond a level, we are looking at sticky inflation which will probably take years to come down, along with a significant amount of economic pain from the tightening
4. Equity markets still haven't discounted the amount of economic pain that we might be meeting shortly
5. Bonds are trash because the interest rate is below inflation and basically guarantees you will be poorer and poorer each passing year

So if not stocks (at these levels), if not bonds, and if not cash, then where?

The proposed solution (which I want you guys to critique):

1. A portfolio consisting of 33% Gold + 33% Silver + 33% Platinum, all through low cost, physically backed ETFs
2. If these metals rise, and equity markets fall, probably take some profits from the metals and put them gradually into the falling stock market

Banking,Started working at a bank &amp; scared I made a huge mistake regarding Power of Attorney,"I recently just started a new job working as a teller at the bank. I live in Canada. I work at a branch in my city that is in the downtown area and we deal with alot of people who are homeless or under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. So far I love it, but today was an extremely stressful and busy day full of that. 

A man in his late 30's and his mother were next in line and I was ready to help them. If I remember correctly, she was about 75 years old. They both presented ID and their debit cards and verified themselves - he was her son. Her account had roughly $3400 in it and he presented a bunch of bills he had enclosed in separate envelopes that they were there to pay off. Once I opened her profile, it prompted me that she had a Power of Attorney... However, I wasn't able to verify WHO the POA was because my computer crashed. I paid the bills from her chequing account, which left her with around $3000. 

Then he proceeded to tell me that he would like the rest of her funds transferred to his account, which I did. And he paid a portion of his own phone bill as well with this money.

So now that leaves me here lol - bringing workload home and essentially stressing about it in bed and that I may lose my job for a mistake that I accept I made by not verifying he was the actual POA. Mother and son both signed receipts together upon leaving the bank and she seemed comfortable and A-okay with the circled balance I made on her accounts receipt (which was only $5 now), but that can only be an assumption on my part. 

When I go in on Monday, first thing I'm going to do is pull up her profile and verify who her POA(s) is. But my question to you guys I guess is, can a POA even take funds like that from their family members account? And let's per say, her husband was the actual POA and her son wasn't, what will happen next? 

I'm scared I really effed up lol... - TIA",finance,1656142537
CryptoCurrency,"The market shitshow is not over yet, exercise caution! Don't fall for shady YouTubers, watch out for the macro economy instead!","A lot of ""influencers"" / ""out-of-rich-status"" dudes are propagating how they can see the bottom now and that they have seen it all before and know exactly how market will unfold. All of that is horse shit. Do not fall for that. This entire crowed was rooting for $100K Bitcoin in January 2022. 

The far more, if not the most, important things to watch right now is the macroeconomy covering federal policies, employment, interest rates, inflation and GDP. These indicators move the market, not the gut feel based on 2013 cycle by the random YouTube/ Twitter crypto creeps.

Governments are under tremendous pressure to bring down inflation and cost of living and they wouldn't mind further tightening the capital flow even at the risk of full blown deep recession. Remember, politicians can win election in a shitty stock market but CAN NOT win election if the common citizen can't afford grocery, gas and essential goods.

There is no ""V"" shape recovery waiting here, it's going to be long drawn journey unfortunately - simple reason - no $8T stimulus to uplift the country through pandemic. So, here is what I suggest watching closely to gauge the market in the coming months:

1) Inflation rates/ Gas prices

2) Employment market - job creations, hiring and turnover rates

3) Federal policies on interest rate

4) Geopolitical escalations (Eastern Europe, Asia)

personalfinance,What is a good travel credit card option for a young person with low income but really good credit?,"I'm 25 years old and am a farmworker who brings home about $1800 every month after taxes. I don't have a lot in savings, basically just an emergency fund and then some for traveling later this year. Only debt I have is about $12,000 in federal student loans, and my credit score is above 750. I pay cash/debit for everything at this point. 

Since plane tickets are so expensive, I want to look into getting a travel points card with a limit no greater than $500. Due to my budget, I really don't want to pay any sort of yearly fee, and I would mostly be using it for gas and groceries, which I don't spend a ton on (more gas than groceries at this point.) Is it worth it for me to get a card with my budget, will the points amass to anything? TIA",finance,1656151654
CryptoMarkets,Will these DeFi platforms still be a thing for about 3 years from now?,"During these past months, we have experienced a rollercoaster from the market trend but we ended up seeing a downtrend more often which makes our token holdings value become depreciated over time. This makes me think if we can just find some platforms to leverage our funds.

Well, some of my friends suggested that I just reserve some stables while waiting for the final dip and not get trapped with the fake breakouts. But some are also suggesting to either lend then buy more tokens on dip or just stake some of my remaining assets to some centralized exchanges.

That's why I come up with a conclusion to find some effective DeFi platforms while still waiting for the next bull trend or reversal and here's what I've found:

1️⃣ Cryptocom

This platform provides a wide range of services. This includes a full-fledged cryptocurrency exchange, interest-earning accounts, a DeFi wallet, loans, credit cards, and other services. You can earn interest on dozens of different crypto assets through its lending services. The APY varies depending on the token and the length of the lock-up period.

2️⃣ Aqru

Aqru is a highly regarded DeFi lending platform that allows you to earn interest on your unused digital tokens. If you deposit a supported stablecoin, you will receive an even higher APY. This includes DAI, Tether, and USD Coin. They offer no lock-up terms on any of its crypto interest accounts. As a result, you will earn interest on your chosen account on a flexible basis, which means you can withdraw funds whenever you want.

3️⃣ Equilibrium

Equilibrium is a Polkadot-based one-stop DeFi platform that enables high leverage in trading and borrowing digital assets. It combines a fully functional money market and an orderbook-based DEX. Equilibrium's native utility token, EQ, is used for communal governance. xDOT is a liquid and tradeable wrapped DOT that unlocks the liquidity of parachain auctioned DOT and provides multiple crowdloan bonuses on Polkadot.

4️⃣ Binance

They are known for their leading cryptocurrency exchange, which provides nearly 100 million clients with over 1,000 trading markets. Its crypto interest accounts, which offer some of the best yields in the market on medium and low-cap coins, are at the forefront of this. Opening an account at Binance takes just minutes and if you live in an eligible country, you can deposit funds with a debit/credit card.

5️⃣ Nexo

Nexo is perhaps one of the best DeFi platforms for those seeking to generate interest on stablecoins.  The highest interest rate at Nexo is actually paid on a conventional crypto token. That is to say, by depositing Axie Infinity, you will be paid a highly attractive rate of 36% if I'm not mistaken.

Even those I find some of these platforms fascinating, I'm still skeptical about how will the market affect my investments through entering some sort of staking or lending in the long run especially if we are going to face a multi-year bear market.

personalfinance,Income situation changing and need help knowing how to handle student loans &amp; retirement,"Myself (35) and my spouse (32) will have a drastically new income situation in a couple of months and are trying to decide what to do with the change; because we are underprepared for retirement, we’d like to maybe own a home and have a child someday, and I have a very large federal student loan debt situation that needs addressing. 

- previously been living on $60k net shared throughout the pandemic, about to change to $145k net shared. 

- student loans: -$200k total @ 6.75% interest, making for a minimum monthly interest payment of $1,125. (I feel very ashamed of this and feel like I need to qualify it somehow… I grew up poor, did a graduate program in the arts in a HCOL area, and family encouraged maxing out Grad PLUS loans to cover tuition &amp; COL. Every day I think I should have known better and hate my past self for this decision.) 

- Monthly total COL without student loans: $4,000. We hate our apartment and would like something more comfortable, but that would likely raise this to $5000 in our city, which I worry about. 

- Liquid savings: $70k. Set most of this up and paid off private student loans (yes, there was previously even more student loan debt) when I had a one year job that paid very well.  

- Retirement: $65k total in a 401k and a 403b. We also have union pensions. 

So the question is: do we just throw the roughly $6,500 per month at the student loans to get them gone as soon as possible? Or do we split it up between retirement and student loans and saving a bit more for a home at some point? 

Is it useful in any way to throw as much as possible at the loans up front to reduce the principal to a more manageable place and then start splitting up the monthly surplus to include retirement? 

The other wrench in the gears is that I feel like we have to make as much hay while the sun shines as possible, because my work is not stable. COVID derailed my career for 2.5 years right when it was starting to hit its stride, and I’m terrified something else will do the same now. But even without COVID, my field is unstable. My job could last 5 months or 10 years. It will be finite though. That is certain. Experience tells me one year is a very safe bet, and two years is a strong possibility. And at that point, I will likely have something else lined up, barring another global catastrophe. However, the only certainty is that I can return to my old job I got stuck at when COVID killed everything and our monthly income would go from $12k to $8k/mo. 

So there it all is. I do not know what to do. And I feel so angry with myself for putting us in a place where $12,000/mo doesn’t feel like enough. That’s insane to me… Please advise.",finance,1656163053

stocks,A market environment where indexing does not work?,"I've been contemplating this for a while, and I'd love to get some other thoughts.

Over the past 40 years, we've had a macro environment where interest rates have steadily decreased for a number of different reasons. In addition to structurally lower interest rates, the last 12 years were also an environment with effectively infinite QE.

This low inflation, QE supported environment is likely a huge reason why US tech stocks were able to dominate and have outsized returns starting in 2009-10. Money was effectively free, making it easier to grow a business without needing to show immediate profits. This is largely what created the environment to support a Tech boom and higher P/E's.

But as we know, the top 10 companies of today are unlikely to be the top 10 companies in 10 years from now.

With the macro environment now shifting away from unlimited QE and a breakdown of globalization, there's a lot of talk of a regime change. I don't have the words for how important this could be for equity investors. A regime change is not a ""good"" thing (at least in the short term), and it could very well lead to a world of structurally higher interest rates, the end of QE, and ultimately, a change in investor perceptions.

If this regime change does happen (and we are seeing the beginning of it), and QE goes away for the next 40 years and interest rates ""normalize"" to 5%+ as they used to be before the 08 financial crisis, I'm wondering what that will mean for investors.

Why buy a stock at a 20+ P/E when you could buy a Bond that pays 5%+ guaranteed? All of a sudden, the average P/E we've been accustomed to for the last decade+ is completely  unsustainable. An example of this, during the inflationary bear market in the 70's, the stock market got down to P/E's below 10x. Could you imagine what would happen to SPY if it went to a P/E of 10? People would say it's the end of the world and investing is dead. I don't anticipate this will happen, I'm just putting into context what higher interest rates for longer will do to stocks, and the higher interest rates get, the lower P/E's have to go.

So, if we are going through a regime change due to higher for longer inflation, and the last 40 years of low interest rates is over, what happens to equity valuations, and does it still make sense to index to something like the S&amp;P?

Would it make more sense to Index specifically to cash flowing dividend payers that are already priced below 15x P/E on average? When there's a real cost of capital and money is no longer ""free"", it seems to me that investors will prefer return of capital rather than return on capital.

The idea of a regime change away from structurally low interest rates could make stock market investing extremely unattractive, and the fact that broad market ETF's have become such a crowded trade over the last 2 decades, in addition to the macro environment we had, it just makes me think indexing won't be the free lunch it used to be.

That doesn't mean I think we should all become stock pickers or bond investors. But, it does make me think that the way ETF's are currently structured (with high P/E Tech being the biggest weighting), returns will be severely muted going forward.

All of this of course is speculation on the idea that we are going through a regime change, and interest rates will ""never"" be as low as we've seen them recently. It's easy for people to anchor to what the world used to be (we saw this when Covid happened, people thought we were just a 1-2 week lockdown away from the world going back to normal, but it never did.)

I find it difficult to believe one day everything will just go back to 0% interest rates and markets will continue to grind up like nothing ever happened. I find it much more likely that interest rates are higher for longer, and investors start to prefer different types of equities than the ones we've seen over the last 20 years, which ultimately could lead to broad market ETF's being a ""dead"" investment for a long time, at least until a new group of ""leaders"" emerges like the FAANG stocks.",finance,1656173171

I currently make \~178k/yr ($85.693/hr) as a Pharmacy Supervisor in SD, California. 

Current Contributions = 

401a = 6% w/ 4.5% match (split as below between DB/DC Plans)

403b = 5% Roth Contribution currently

My employer offers a weird 401a retirement plan. I can contribute 6% (after-tax basis) and receive 4.5% match (pre-tax basis). The 1st 1% of EE contribution and 1st 2% of employer contributions go to this ""Defined Benefits Plan"". The next 5% of EE and remaining 2.5% of employer contributions goes to the ""Defined Contribution Plan"" which allows for specific fund placement (e.g. JP Morgan Value Adv Fund).

The Defined Benefits Plan = invested by the employer and provide guaranteed rate of return which is stated to be 6% or 120% of the federal mid-term rate in effect each January. The guaranteed annual rate of return on the matching employer contributions is 6%.

The Defined Contribution Plan = investment in to mutual funds, etc (I picked JP Morgan Value Adv).

I also have a 403b that goes through Lincoln Financial through my Employer = 5% Roth currently and allows for various fund placement. Currently the funds it is in is 90% stocks, 10% bonds.

Therefore, my overall questions is optimization...

1. Is there any reason I need a Traditional IRA? Would I benefit more from contributing it to my brokerage acct since I won't get any tax incentives?
2. Should I change my 403b to pre-tax if won't be pulled until I retire anyways and will have lower tax bracket at that time?

personalfinance,"If you have large savings but no income, wouldn't it be better to take a subsidized student loan rather than pay out of pocket?","Let's say you have $10,000 in savings but you are a full-time student so you don't have a job at the moment (or if you do it doesn't cover much). You qualify for a federally subsidized student loan of $3,000 to help cover the cost of the next year of college. You can choose to pay the $3,000 out of your savings or you can accept the subsidized loan and not worry about paying it off until 6 months after you graduate. Your frugal lifestyle will stay the same regardless of which choice you make. You also are very responsible and will most certainly have enough in savings to pay it off immediately after graduation before any interest accrues. 

Under what circumstances would someone NOT accept the loan? It seems to me that accepting the loan is the obvious choice: you get to keep your emergency fund or a fund that could be used for safe investments, you add to your credit profile (usually not much if you're a student), and since the debt stays the same but inflation still exists, paying it off later would save you money (assuming you paid it off with the help of an internship or job that has wages that increase over time.

stocks,Visualize how the Fed's forecasted tightening schedule has changed since September '21. A look at Dot Plots!,"**What's happening with the Federal Funds Rate and its forecasts?**

Future interest rate hike announcements play a huge role in the market. [This visual](https://i.imgur.com/TDz4tDH.png) from Blackrock depicts on the left panel what the Fed has in past months estimated the future trend of interest rates to be.

Each Fed meeting, the Fed members take a vote, and the median forecasted Federal Funds Rate (FFR) is plotted for the next few years. The so-called [dot plot](https://i.imgur.com/yc7sX2L.png) (Graph from Bloomberg) shows all the estimated forecasts by each member, but the Blackrock plot I linked takes the median trend and connects the median dots. We see the curves for several months up to June, with the actual FFR trend plotted in green (in the first plot). You can see can see that even though the actual FFR the last few months has not actually deviated very much from forecasts made back in September 2021, the trajectory is *much* steeper and scheduled to be a lot higher than what was anticipated.

This is why forward guidance and the *rate* of interest rate hikes matter. The December '21 curve and June '22 curve have dramatically different implications, and this has been a major (if not *the*) cause of this year's current bear market.

[This is what financial conditions have done](https://i.imgur.com/HFC00NO.png) as a result. The Fed did this through forward guidance, not past interest rate hikes. Changes in that future curve immediately affect bond prices/yields in global government and corporate credit markets, and as a result, translate to dampened equity valuations.

I took this data and graphs from [Blackrock's weekly market commentary](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/publications/weekly-commentary). They publish weekly their tactical (short term) and strategic (long term) views on different asset classes (emerging market stocks, private credit markets, etc.). I don't find those so valuable, but I do like their summary on markets each week. Here is the [year-to-date](https://i.imgur.com/ciFkuXa.png) performance of a broad set of assets. They write in this figure's caption that ""the two ends of the bars show the lowest and highest returns at any point this
year-to-date, and the dots represent current year-to-date returns.""

**This is separate from Quantitative Tightening**

The Federal Funds Rate being hiked is *not* the same thing as quantitative tightening (QT). QT refers to the Federal Reserve letting their assets bought during QE expire (mortgage backed securities and longer term government bonds). 

The Federal Funds rate is the rate at which banks lend to each other in 'overnight lending facilities' to make sure they have adequate liquidity. The Fed manipulates this by buying/selling short term government bonds. This impacts short term borrowing rates primarily.

QE/QT, on the other hand, is about non-traditional assets being bought/sold, like asset-backed securities, or longer term government assets. Alongside the Fed raising rates, the Fed is letting these assets expire without buying more, meaning funds are being taken out of the market to pay the Fed for holding these assets. That is, imagine the Fed bought a bond from the Treasury, the bond expires, and the Treasury pays the Fed the principal, and *poof* that money now disappears. The result has impacts on longer term borrowing rates. 

Similarly, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pay the Fed the principal on mortgage backed securities. These transactions are completely different from those open market operations for the FFR, which are between banks and the Fed to impact the overnight lending rates.

I have describe 'passive' QT, where the Fed just lets assets expire. Another more aggressive QT is called 'active' QT, where the Fed directly sells those longer term assets to remove them from its balance sheets. Passive QT is just letting them naturally expire on their own schedule. Active QT is more hawkish since imagine if one of the biggest buyers of mortgage backed securities in the market decided to start selling them. This would reduce their value (increased supply floating around the market) and raise their yields (need to demand more to hold them).

Other central banks may start doing the same. The Bank of England also has been buying corporate bonds, and those will expire too. The Bank of Japan, if they ever reverse their QE, would have to actually sell their equities, since they not only buy long term bonds and asset-backed securities, but literal stocks!

* There is so much data and so many indicators to gauge how the economy is doing
* But, the data has so much noise and many caveats (*data isn't timely, flaws in how the data is collected &amp; measured, not actionable to connect-the-dots on what I should be doing as an investor*)
* I've had to deal with similar issues as a Finance Manager who needs to report to the C-Suite and investors on how we're doing with the business. We have so much data and the same problems with our data, but how do we use this data to make actionable &amp; swift decisions? 
* Using a similar philosophy, I identified 5 economic indicators that help me quickly &amp; sufficiently gauge how the economy is doing and help me connect-the-dots on what I should be doing as an investor. 
* This is what I found helpful, but love to see your comments on what economic indicators make you a better investor 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Jobs Report**

* **Why:** The North Star for me is that my companies should be delivering strong results if people are employed, making money, and spending their money on goods &amp; services that my company provides. Low unemployment, strong job creation, and a tight labor market quickly signals to me my companies should continue to do well with a firm economy.
* **What I look for**: I'm very focused on the unemployment rate (*3.6%*), number of jobs created (*+390K*), and the labor force participation rate (*62.3%*). The labor market is strong which is great for my companies , but my longer-term outlook for unemployment (*4.0% - 5.0%*), job creation (*+100K*), and LFPR (*\~60%*) is softer to align with demographic trends.
* **Where:**  [Employment Situation - 2022 M05 Results (bls.gov)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm) 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Jobless Claims**

* **Why:** I really like to get a weekly Thursday update on how many people are filing for unemployment so I can get timely &amp; high-frequency update on how the labor market is doing. A strong labor market is very important so my companies can sustain demand and deliver strong results.
* **What I look for**: The pre-COVID average is 218,000 claims so anything below or around this level means the labor market is strong and gives me an indicator that the monthly jobs report should be strong as well.
* **Where:**  [News Release (dol.gov)](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) or find the unemployment insurance weekly claims report here [News Releases | U.S. Department of Labor (dol.gov)](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases)

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Materials released from the Federal Reserve like FOMC Projections, FOMC Minutes, FOMC Announcement, and Fed Chair Press Conference**

* **Why:** They're professional economists, have more resources, and connections than I do to understand how the economy is doing &amp; where it's going. I learn a lot from their expertise and try to make sure I'm on the same page on my understanding of the economy so I know where monetary policy and interest rates are going.
* **What I look for**: My favorite thing to look for is their FOMC projections since they share their forecasts for economic growth (*\~2%*), unemployment rate (*\~4%*), inflation (*\~2% in the long-term*), and interest rates (*another 175 bps by the end of the year*). 
* **Where:**  [The Fed - Meeting calendars and information (federalreserve.gov)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) 

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Inflation**

* **Why:** The Federal Reserve looks at inflation to determine if interest rates should go up or down. If inflation is too high, the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates, tighten monetary policy, and will negatively impact stock prices regardless of how well my companies perform.
* **What I look for**: I look at PCE since the Federal Reserve wants that to average around 2.0% for stable inflation and I also look at CPI. CPI is available earlier than PCE and has recently been **\~2pp** higher than PCE. I expect PCE to be **\~6.6%** for May '22 since CPI for May '22 was **8.6%**. Not good compared to the Fed's target of \~2.0% for inflation.
* **Where:**  [CPI Home : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (bls.gov)](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) 

&amp;#x200B;

**5. GDP from the Atlanta Fed**

* **Why:**  Strong business activity in a country translates to higher profits for my companies. It's an important metric as an investor for that reason, but low on my list because GDP released from the BEA isn't timely at all (*it's released quarterly*), I'm already making decisions as an investor way after this is released, and there are a lot of noisy components that affects the headline number that has no impact on my companies. That's why I like to see the real-time GDP forecast from the Atlanta Fed since their model is built similarly to how GDP is measured and the model really helps me understand how numerous data points that are released over time will impact GDP like home sales, manufacturing indexes, and other data points that are tough to make investment decisions on their own.

personalfinance,An easy step by step guide on how to come back from bankruptcy ; my personal journey from chapter 13 and a 580 credit score,"*Title is wrong I can't change it. I filed for* ***chapter 7 not 13***. *Apologies. Added some new stuff as well that I forgot about last night. Please also note that I started this process* ***after I received a discharge in my bankruptcy***. *You'll be able to get a discharge date by calling the court that your attorney filed it with and asking the clerk for what date it was discharged. Discharge times can vary.*

*Disclaimer: This post is informational only and does not represent financial advice for any specific person. This is about what I personally did and should not be misconstrued as advice for you, the reader.*

&amp;#x200B;

From a young age I was always fascinated with my credit score and credit in general. It blew my mind that some company somewhere trusted me enough with 1, 2, or 3 thousand dollars at the (ignorant) age of 19, with no ""real"" consequences if I don't pay it back. Fast-forward 8 years... I'm almost 28, filed bankruptcy at 24, and I'm still living with the consequences that I thought didn't exist.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't matter how you got here, or if you're going through anything similar to what I did, but let's just say Discover is very generous to pretty much everyone, and at the age of 21 I had a 721 credit score with an AMEX Gold, Blue Cash Preferred, Discover It and one store card. Gold card was a charge card but apart from that my credit limit was over 17 thousand dollars! Needless to say I didn't use it wisely.

35 thousand dollars of debt later I filed chapter 13 after being in default for close to 8 months. My bankruptcy was approved and my credit tanked to 580 or 560. A little over 2 years later I'm now at a 706 credit score with a car note, 3 CC with a total limit of close to 10k and no CC debt. Let me go over with you guys how I rebounded. Note that this is not financial advice, and everyone's situation will be different, and my method of credit building may not work for you personally (although, *personally*, I'm pretty sure **it will**).

&amp;#x200B;

First steps first... you're either here because you fucked up and are looking to rebound or because you're looking to see how I built credit in this situation.

# Start off with a secured credit card

1. Capital One is the one company that comes to mind. That is the first card that I got back, because it was one of the only major companies that wasn't included in my bankruptcy. There are plenty of secured card options, but you'll need to start here.
2. Use your new secured card to buy gas once or week, or basically, just put about 10-20% of your limit on there each month, and pay it off on time and in full each month.

&amp;#x200B;

# Try something like Self, where you get a loan on a CD

I used Self on a one year term. Basically Self is an app where they purchase a Certificate of Deposit (CD) on your behalf, and you pay them monthly. They report your payments to the credit bureaus, and you get positive payment history in return for a small admin fee. Self definitely made a difference in my credit score.

# You'll notice an almost immediate difference

Around your third month (or possibly sooner), you'll notice anywhere from a 5-30 point increase. My credit went from 560-580 to over 600.

# Apply for another credit card after 6-9 months of on-time payments

By now, hopefully your score should be over or around 620, and you should be carrying no revolving debt. At this point we should start looking for pre-approvals on unsecured credit cards. Personally, I went with a Capital One QuicksilverOne Rewards card, for Fair credit. This card does have an annual fee of $39, but you're more likely to get approved for it compared to their plain Quicksilver card with no fee. That card requires a higher credit rating.

*It's important to not dig yourself back into a hole at this point. Make sure you don't make the same mistake twice. If you can not control yourself with credit cards, then these suggestions might not be the best for you. It's imperative that you know your personal limits.*

&amp;#x200B;

# We're more than halfway there

You're going to repeat the process now, and split the money you spend on your one card to now evenly spread it across two. You shouldn't need more than $100 on each card per month. Although this can vary, because it is best to keep your credit utilization to less than 20-25%.

Rinse and repeat the process for several months, making sure to pay in full and on time, each time.

&amp;#x200B;

# A car note is always helpful, assuming you need it, and it is affordable

Car notes are great loans to have on your report. They're easier to get approved for compared to a mortgage, they typically have lower rates than personal loans, and they're usually for more money. Car notes are the precursor to a great credit score that will only become perfect after the application of a mortgage. I bought a new 2020 Rav 4 after my first son was born in September of 2020. Needed a good family car. I attempted to purchase it myself and got slapped with a 10% interest rate from some lenders, until asking a family member to cosign for me and getting it down to 4.74%. If you do not have anyone to cosign with you, this process is not impossible, it just might take a bit longer.

&amp;#x200B;

Now after close to two years of on-time payments on my car note, no credit card debt, and close to 4-5 years after filing bankruptcy, my credit score is back up to over 700.

personalfinance,Am I in good or bad shape? And should I remarry?,"Without making this a crazy long post, I’ll do my best to summarize. I’m wondering if I need to do anything different, get a job, and will I financially be able to support myself if I stay retired. 

I’m a 38 year old widow who received life insurance and survivor benefits such as health insurance when my husband died. I have no children and I reside in OR. 

When my spouse died in Apr 2020, I received $500k. I spent $80k cash towards the down payment of a new home (sold for 415k). I also sold our home. I paid $42k cash on a new car, traded in the old car. My financial advisor and I put the rest of that money into an investment account. Currently there’s about 300k-320k in there, my individual account. It’s “supposed” to last anywhere from 9-12 years with me taking out $3k/mo to support myself. 

I rolled over about 250k from my spouses retirement account (thrift savings plan) to a navy federal IRA account. A Roth was also set up and there’s about 8k in there. 

$3k is transferred into my checking every month  so that I can pay bills and what not. My mortgage payment is $2k a month (stick built house, Zillow currently values it at $584k). My mom lives here and pays me $850/mo under the table. 

My utilities come out to about $500. Not including food or entertainment. 

I don’t work. 

I am also dating a 40 year old retired man with no kids and divorced once. He got a disability’s rating with the VA (Air Force) and he’s getting a monthly income of $2800/mo through them. He bought a house (manufactured) last year after leaving CA. Hes applied for SS disability and could get another monthly income with that. 

I might choose to remarry before the age of 60 with this man but would forfeit my husbands 100% social security benefits I would get. But I could get some good tax breaks filing married, that investment income is breaking the bank during tax season. This year I had to pay over $4k.",finance,1656202798

personalfinance,Lifestyle decision change. Keep job or seek job change,"So I am having a difficult deciding on what to do between staying at my current role and attempting to stay at the same company by promotion. Or option two: attempting a change in jobs due to higher financial gain. I am currently a credit analyst that makes roughly $45K. The role is 10-7pm Mon-Fri and I like the people I work with. The only thing I do not like is the drive. It's about 37 minutes one way. It was my first job after graduating with my MBA. I went straight from my undergrad completion to grad school while bartending to pay the bills. The bartending gig payed well enough and fit my schedule, but I knew it was time to move on to a ""real job"" one I finished my MBA. I was hired on as a temp in September '21 and was fully hired on this February. The work is decent and manageable, but I'm not scheduled for a pay raise until next April. They stated if I started in the role for 2.5 - 3 years, I could be a good fit as a financial analyst 1 for the company. The role probably makes low 60-65K. That's assuming for any open role that opens up in the area I live in. The company is based out of Texas so I would most likely need to move there for work. It wouldn't be too far from where I live currently so that's not a big deal. I currently live with my girlfriend and have very LCOL rent. I have no car payment and no kids. However, I still feel like saving is pretty tough for the amount of income I bring in. I do want to propose to my girlfriend within the next 4-6 months. So here is my other option that I considered that's very left field: applying for a federal job as an air traffic controller or FBI special agent...Yes, I'm dead serious. I have never had a job I've always wanted to have. I'm always been a jack of all trades, master of none. My current aspirations were to eventually get into a higher level financial role making a decent salary. I think I would like to get my CMA or CPA if possible down the line, but I'm still 2-3 classes short of being qualified for the CPA. On top of that, I'd still need to pass the exams and study for a solid 8-9 months to ensure it's done well. I'm the type of person that feels that work is work no matter what you're doing. I'm a realist. I'm willing to put up with the stress of more responsibilities if that gives me much higher gains. In this case, it takes quite awhile to get through the federal hiring process as well. Both options require added schooling to progress in their line of work. The downsides are this: something I've never done before, would have to move to learn schooling for 5 or 6 months and relocate. Plus the hours would be less than satisfactory. But at that level of pay, it would seem to be worth it for a good while if I take to it. I know if have to get accepted into these academies before I start planning anything, but it doesn't hurt to plan it way ahead. So here's what I'm really wondering about.... If I receive word about getting accepted into either of the federal programs, it would be start of next year and be done around the fall of next year possibly. If I just started with my job now, I would have a year and a half experience. Would I be better off sticking to my current situation with no idea of upward progression. Or do I give the FBI role or air traffic controller job a shot. Obviously, I would give 100% and follow everything through. It's just I don't exactly know my ceilings and likely setbacks with either case. It'd be nice to hear stranger's thoughts on the Internet. I apologize for the novel and my thoughts jumping around.

If you need more details first, I understand completely. Back in 2006, my wife (at the time) decided to move in with a guy she met while playing World of Warcraft. Shortly after, I presented her with a divorce and as a part of the process, we needed to fill out paperwork that would outline how each of us was going to pay our joint debts. It was during this ordeal when I was surprised with the discovery that together, we owed around $90,000 in debt not including our mortgage payment. (I know…I know. I should have been watching our finances more closely – among other things). There were 2 cars. She would pay off the one she drove, and I would pay off the one I drove. We also had about 9 credit cards and a Home Equity Line of Credit. (HELOC). She earned more than me at the time and we both agreed that she would pay off $50,000 and I would take on $40,000.

I was all over the place and trying to keep all of this straight in my head was not working. I desperately needed to see who I owed, how much the payment was and when it was due (including the mortgage which she said she wasn’t going to pay since she also had rent now).

So, I started writing a program that included not only the basics of who, when and how much, but also “Where do I go to pay that bill?” and “What is my login information?” I wanted to write something so awesome, that there was no way I would ever miss a payment again. So, alerts were added, and then a line that shows me what bill is coming up was added and it just kept growing from there. If you’re the kind of person that wants to know what bill is most overdue, well, there’s that too. Budgeting was added if you’re interested in putting a little aside. Also, a credit card screen was added so you can see how much interest you’re paying on your debts. The cool thing about this screen is the built-in analysis. If you take the time to enter the correct data like interest rates on your credit cards, you’ll get some very useful information that will help you decide which one(s) you should pay off first.

I liked the name ""Bill Wizard Pro"" and I used to own that domain, but I let it lapse and someone else snatched it up. So, I had to come up with a new name for the app to match the domain name and the best I could do is Bills Wizard. I don’t think it’s as catch though. Also, I’m remarried now and have a great credit score and no longer live paycheck to paycheck, and I owe that all to Bills Wizard. We honestly use it all the time as it has become our only source of information regarding our bills. If you open it up and look at it every couple of days, it will help tremendously.

I hope it provides help to those that need it.",technology,1656225089

CryptoCurrency,"Wall Street On Parade, June 23, 2022: “Is the Crypto Threat to U.S. Financial Stability $889 Billion or $10 Trillion?”","## [Is the Crypto Threat to U.S. Financial Stability $889 Billion or $10 Trillion?](https://archive.ph/Jk1y0)

By [Pam Martens and Russ Martens](https://archive.ph/ODR8L): June 23, 2022 \~

Yesterday, [Benzinga reported](https://archive.ph/8Mlex) on a curious statement made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday. Powell was asked by Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) if the Fed had been tracking the events in the crypto markets in the past several weeks. Powell responded that the Fed was watching those events “very carefully” but the Fed “did not see significant macro-economic implications.” The article goes on to lend credence to this observation from the Fed by noting the following:

&gt;“It is important to note the entire cryptocurrency market cap is $889.25 billion versus the American GDP, which is $25.34 trillion, and an equities market that controls more than $49 trillion.”

Before we drill down into the weeds of that crypto market cap figure, it’s important to note that former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan told Congress that he saw no major economic threat coming from subprime debt. In October 2008, as much of Wall Street and the U.S. economy lay in ruins from subprime debt bombs and related derivatives, Greenspan testified to a House Committee that “Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders’ equity, myself included, are in a state of shocked disbelief.”

Seriously? The most corrupt industry in America for more than a century and the head of the U.S. central bank thinks it’s an altruistic protector of shareholders’ interests?

The Fed and fellow Wall Street regulators appear to have made the same mistake today with crypto. As large financial institutions have entangled themselves deeper and deeper into all things crypto, federal regulators have been studying the problem rather than taking action.

So exactly how big is the problem? The [$889.25 billion market cap](https://archive.ph/Ir7Sc) for crypto cited by Benzinga is a miniscule part of the problem. That’s just the market value of all of the crypto that trades. And it should be noted that the market cap of crypto stood at $2.7 trillion as of last November, so investors have already experienced a negative wealth effect of $1.8 trillion.

But what about all of the crypto mining stocks that went public and have now lost 70 to 90 percent of investors’ money? What about the loans taken out by the crypto mining companies to buy all of that energy-guzzling computer equipment? What about the billions of dollars in margin loans sitting at federally-insured banks that were made to hedge funds to leverage their crypto bets? What about the bank loans to venture capital firms to invest in hundreds of crypto startup firms?

Estimates are that the real size of the crypto market is more [in the range of $10 trillion](https://archive.ph/bFtis). Anyone who thinks that a market of that size can implode without “significant macro-economic implications” is likely not an economist. (Unfortunately, Jerome Powell, the head of the monetary policy setting institution in the United States has a law degree, not an economics degree. And not to put too fine a point on it, but Powell was dead wrong on inflation being transitory and we’re all paying a steep price for that botched forecast.)

Another potential negative wealth effect may come from investors who bought cryptocurrency on their credit card and are watching the value of their crypto collapse while the interest rate on their credit card balance soars as a result of the Fed’s rate hikes. [LendEdu reports](https://archive.ph/dob9i) that its survey showed that “18.15% of Bitcoin investors answered ‘I used a credit card to fund and purchase.’ ”

If you are gasping for breath at the news that U.S. regulators have actually allowed cryptocurrencies (variously called “[rat poison squared](https://archive.ph/DgCfS)” and [a Ponzi scheme](https://archive.ph/RCMIm) by very smart people) to be purchased on credit cards, you might want to sit down and put aside any cup of hot liquid in your hand while we fill in the rest of the details.

Over the past few days, we have been emailing some of the major providers of credit cards to find out if they allow their card members to purchase crypto on their credit cards. (We did that because crypto exchange, [Coinmama.com](https://archive.ph/VuHGM), shows a Mastercard and a Visa emblem directly below the “Buy” button on their website. The crypto exchange, Binance, also prominently features Mastercard and Visa and [says this](https://archive.ph/0H0Kf): “At Binance, you can buy crypto with everyday fees using a VISA or Mastercard credit card. Alternatively, Binance also provides crypto purchases via bank transfer, fiat deposit, and e-wallet.”) 

Here are the answers we have received thus far from the credit card companies:

**Mastercard** responded as follows: “Mastercard is working with over 60 crypto leading wallets and platforms. We continue to launch a range of products and services with these players, including the 24 crypto card programs that have been publicly announced. Consumers can buy crypto using their Mastercard card to instantly convert their crypto holding into fiat and spend wherever Mastercard is accepted at more than 90 million merchants worldwide. Only fiat currency enters Mastercard’s network. Mastercard is leading in innovation through programs like our recent partnership with Nexo and the launch of the Gemini Card with a simple mission — to deliver people new and one-of-a-kind choices in how they pay and to make crypto more accessible across the ecosystem. We also have partnerships with Bakkt and Uphold to make crypto card spend more accessible. You can learn more about our programs [here](https://archive.ph/70DO6) and [here.](https://archive.ph/DTWiC)”

**American Express** told us this: “In line with industry practice, today we don’t allow our cardmembers to purchase crypto using their credit card, as much as we wouldn’t allow them to buy stocks. We see decentralized crypto, like Bitcoin, still largely an asset to store value, rather than a good or service. As the space evolves, we will continue to monitor it and to pursue parity. We are, however, working with partners to help them launch payments products on our network. For example, Abra just launched the [Abra Crypto Card on the American Express network](https://archive.ph/6FfJ3). This card transacts in U.S. dollars, and offers cryptocurrency as rewards. We are not the issuer, rather, facilitating their U.S. dollar transactions in our capacity as a payments network, while extending some of the unique American Express benefits to their customers.”

The entanglements at **Visa** with crypto are so mind-numbing that you’ll have to [read it for yourself](https://archive.ph/g5RQZ).

**Capital One** shared this: “Capital One does not enable consumers to purchase cryptocurrencies by borrowing on their Capital One credit cards. Consumers can, however, purchase cryptocurrencies via their debit cards and direct ACH transactions with their Capital One 360 checking accounts.”

**Chase**, part of **JPMorgan Chase,** told us this: “We decline crypto purchases on credit cards.”

Adding to the insanity of allowing cryptocurrencies (many of which are backed by nothing) to continue to make [major encroachments into the U.S. financial system](https://archive.ph/l0rP6), the Fed has taken no action, other than to say it’s studying the problem. On November 23 of last year, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) [released a joint statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20211123a1.pdf)on crypto which said this:

&gt;“Throughout 2022, the agencies plan to provide greater clarity on whether certain activities related to crypto-assets conducted by banking organizations are legally permissible, and expectations for safety and soundness, consumer protection, and compliance with existing laws and regulations related to:  
&gt;  
&gt;• Crypto-asset safekeeping and traditional custody services.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Ancillary custody services.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Facilitation of customer purchases and sales of crypto-assets.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Loans collateralized by crypto-assets.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Issuance and distribution of stablecoins.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Activities involving the holding of crypto-assets on balance sheet.”

Citigroup, the bank holding company which received the largest bailout in U.S. banking history during and after the 2008 financial crash, apparently isn’t waiting to find out from its regulators what’s legal and what’s not legal.

According to [a press release yesterday at Business Wire](https://archive.ph/Ic381), Citigroup has selected Metaco “to develop a platform to enable clients to store and settle digital assets seamlessly and securely. Citi intends to fully integrate METACO’s bank-grade digital asset custody and orchestration platform, Harmonize, into its existing infrastructure, to develop and pilot digital asset custody capabilities.”

Citigroup’s exposure to risky derivatives and subprime debt instruments collapsed its stock price during the 2008 financial crash. Its stock traded at 99 cents in early 2009. Beginning in December 2007 and lasting through at least June of 2010, Citigroup received the following in bailouts: $2.5 *trillion* in secret cumulative loans from the Federal Reserve; $45 billion in capital injections from the U.S. Treasury; the Federal government guaranteed over $300 billion of Citigroup’s assets; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) guaranteed $5.75 billion of its senior unsecured debt and $26 billion of its commercial paper and interbank deposits.

Citigroup has apparently received a warning from the SEC that if it builds a crypto platform and begins to act as a custodian for cryptocurrencies, it’s going to impact its balance sheet – which means that the Fed will also have to require it to hold more capital against risky assets. Citigroup reported the following on its quarterly filing (10-Q) with the SEC for the quarter ending March 31, 2022:

&gt;“In March 2022, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121, which expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding the accounting for obligations to safeguard crypto-assets an entity holds for platform users. Specifically, the guidance requires issuers that hold digital assets for their platform users to recognize a liability for their obligation to safeguard the digital assets held and a corresponding asset, measured initially and subsequently at fair value. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2022, with retrospective application to the beginning of the fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. Citi is currently assessing the application of SAB 121, but based on its current activity does not expect any impact to its results of operations as a result of adopting SAB 121.”",cryptocurrency,1656264721

personalfinance,"My landlord is selling the unit, should I just buy it?","Just moved into a new rental apartment on 06/01 in a suburb of Boston, MA. While on vacation last weekend, I received an email from my landlord's agent saying I needed to have the place cleaned and prepped for an open house. On the flight back it hit me that if I can afford the rent, I can likely afford the mortgage. So started running some numbers, and thought you folks might have some quality advice.

&amp;#x200B;

List price is $600k, but personally I think the value is closer to $550k having lived there for a few weeks. I do well and have a fairly secure and specialized job in a large corporate institution. Been there about 13 months. Annual gross income is approx. $121k with a $6k (pretax) performance based bonus. I carry about 48k worth of debt between student loans and car (necessity for travel to work). Unfortunately, my savings are minimal. I hold about 38k in the bank. Would be more but I had to hand over $8100 in security deposit, broker fee, and 1st mo rent with the move in. The advantage of the unit is the spare bedroom. Can rent that to a tenant for $14-1500/mo, which would greatly help with the mortgage payment. Reached out to loan officer that is well trusted by family and friends, and was preapproved for a $600k loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a golden opportunity for investment in east coast property? Or is it a pre-2008 subprime lending-esque trap?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to address some questions:

Current rent is $2700/mo without a roommate, and I expect if I do not purchase it I will either face a steep rent hike at the end of the lease or, if purchased by an intended owner/occupant, I will not be renewed.

If I can negotiate the cost to $560k at 3% down, I calculated the mortgage at $3775/mo, including $170 HOA (per the listing), est $200 insurance, 1% PMI, and 1% loan officer commission all at 5% interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2:

Thanks everyone for the advice. Got off the phone with the loan officer and interest rate is at 5.8%. Threw off all my calculations, and you're all right, I cannot afford it. Lease is good through September 2023, so for the time being I will forego the purchase and keep plugging along as is. May bring in a roommate to help with rent and boost my savings for the next go around.

1. Apple Card - $460 / 22.74% - min $25
2. Discover Card - $2076 / $21.74 % - $60 min; currently have auto pay set at $65
3. Lowes - $513 / 26.99% - min payment varies; currently paying $45 *always above min payment 
4. Personal loan - $12,100 / 14.37% fixed - $316 
5. Car loan - $8000 / 14.25% fixed - $442
6. Students loans - $29,500 / multiple loans w/ fixed rates; $336 *does not include federal loans, this will be an additional $160 per mo. 
7. CareCredit - $1020 / $2 interest charges until October; $34 min; making $40 payments 
9. Other expenses (utilities, phone, internet, gas, pet insurance) - roughly $650
10. Wedding savings - $150/mo (getting married in November)

If a bank believes it is going to make money on a loan, it will issue one by creating new money via some keystrokes. So it has nothing to do with lending out deposits but rather adding new money to the system.

Originally our plan was to stay here until our first kid starts elementary school, but we are recognizing the house has more major projects than we originally anticipated. We do love the layout of the house and many of the features, but the roof is 25 years old, one of the furnaces is 20 years old, the kitchen could use an aesthetic update (currently has high gloss black cabinets with mirror backsplash and grey and pink tile floor), and there is some rotten wood on the sides of the house that will need to be replaced.

Given all that, there's likely going to be a lot of major expenses over the next 5 years or so. We are thinking we ought to sell ASAP, take advantage of the rapid increase in home value of this house in the few years we've owned it, and then either buy another house elsewhere or rent while we figure out the next move. The major deterrent is a) the higher mortgage rates, and b) the only down payment we'd have is whatever we make on this house, which is unlikely to make us competitive buyers in the towns we are looking (at least if we want to maintain an affordable mortgage).

Is selling a wise choice in this case? Or given the higher interest rates, does it make more sense to suck it up, do the renovations that need to happen, and figure out selling and moving towns down the road?

I,(26) bought a home for $160k 2.875 interest in February of last year.

June of that year my father passed and I inherited his home with the expectation of buying out my sister(17) or splitting it with her if I sold it.

His home was listed around 3 months prior and he had an offer for 325k I feel like it may be worth around $350k plus now but the market may be cooling down soon with interest rates.

Financially I make $60k a year. I live well below my means in my current housing situation and can save and invest in retirement funds.

I have sentimental value towards my father's home but I am not sure if I could afford. I would end up with a mortgage around 180k with today's rate
 Which isn't too bad.. it's mostly that the house is on 3 acres, has older drafty windows that need replaced and always seems to have alot of upkeep(boiler and AC went out this past year, bees have chewed a hole in the drywall. I am fixing all of these.)  and high utility bills. 

When I have done the math I think I could afford it but would be house poor and spend most of my time trying to save a buck (having to mow it and do all repairs due to income).

On paper this makes the choice seem pretty simple right? Sell the house and put $150k in the stock market (s&amp;p) and let it help me to early retirement. 

Has anyone else had to make this choice?


 I do love his house and would be able to grow into it but it's more of a family home and I am single for the foreseeable future. 

I just am stuck between guilt of selling his home as the ""easy"" Choice and am very scared I will end up regretting it later in life when the home would be more suited to my lifestyle.

Sorry for the rant guys thanks.

 some figures
My mortgage is $1014 and I take home around 3200 after taxes medical and retirement.
My utilities are around $200 (gas, water electricity) 

Mortgage at dads would be $1400 a month
Electricity shouldn't go up too much 
Gas was $400 a month in winter to keep it at 70 ish. Not running AC but assuming it will go up similiar to gas due to old windows bigger house and vaulted ceilings.

I have a credit score around the 760s (but I know interest rates are high right now regardless of the circumstances). I live in a MCOL city with relatively affordable housing - ideally would get a 2b 1b condo. 

Say I have about 50k for a down payment/closing costs. I know there are tons of variables in terms of taxes/HOA fees but I’m just looking for a general ballpark of what total price I should be looking at. 200k? 300k? I’m just looking for suggestions or examples of what others pay versus their salary.",finance,1656303715
personalfinance,Assuming the loan on a family home,"Hello,  


A family home has been in a bit of a pickle since covid started, the loan was originally going to be assumed by my brother, but things have changed and they're finding another house.  
The original cost of the home was 150,000 and a good 80,000 was paid before they couldn't anymore. Currently, there's around 30,000 in tac on fees and according to my mother, the total cost to assume it (the pay off total) would be 142,000 as seen on her documents. To my knowledge, I would not be paying this upfront, but over time as per a normal loan.  


I have about 40k after this recent check, 2.5k in credit card debt, and a 794 credit score, and no other outstanding debts or obligations. However, I am currently out of college with my bachelors looking for a job, but have paid off my debts from that. Some work has already been done on the house, such as new floors, and people are already ready to move in to help me pay for the mortgage if I assume. Other upfront costs is a new septic pump (about 1-2k iirc), potentially replacing the heating system, and about 1-2 years down the line, a new roof.  


I was also going to contact a rural USDA agent, but the one our family used is unfortunately no longer available, so that is taking some time to rectify. However, from her conversations with my brother it seems that direct family members who assumed the loan would have the same terms as my mother, so keeping the original loan amount and interest rate.  


But I would like to know what everyone else thinks, as I would be putting myself in significant financial risk if I took it on, and while I want to, I need to approach this carefully.  


Thank you.",finance,1656307474

personalfinance,I want to purchase a house in ~1.5 to 2 years. Should I pay off my private student loans to get a better mortgage loan rate?,"Currently I have $75,000 in private student loans. Unfortunately I refinanced rather aggressively and I pay $1,700/month @ 2.3% interest rate. I take home about $8,000 - $9,000 a month. Currently I have about $61,000 in my Savings account, $28,000 in stocks and $10,000 in I bonds. At this point I’m just saving up to purchase a house. 

This is probably a dumb question, but will my private student loans affect my mortgage loan rate? If so, is it better I pay off my student loans, rather than save that money for a larger down payment?",finance,1656308816
Bitcoin,Bitcoin is the magic barrier braker!,"A powerful thought after watching videos of domesday Gold proponents talk about our immediate future of the next decade:

Bitcoin has no boundaries and this allows it to function in a society where everything else is dysfunctional.

For example: Tomorrow a world war springs up globally putting counties against each other. Monetary policy globally blows up and most people world wide start using Bitcoin. The USA is allies with Japan and Canada. Iran and England are allies but not with the USA. 
*In this environment the wars can go on for however long, people can be mining and securing the network all the same the entire time.

This is a really powerful idea the global powers will be able to agree on monetary policy regardless of other conflicts.",cryptocurrency,1656308949
cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown June 27, 2022","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today:

1. It looks like the LIDO community has overwhelmingly voted to NOT self-limit their control of Ethereum PoS delegation.  This is a blow to decentralization in ETH when compared to a blockchain like Cardano. [https://twitter.com/sobizR/status/1540728451124015104](https://twitter.com/sobizR/status/1540728451124015104)

31. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss.

42. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
43. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

45. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources. It’s been obvious this was coming for a while ever since the reports of mining operations dumping hot waste water into the finger lakes and affecting the ecology.

46. Reports are also coming in that the Biden Administration crypto plans due in August will target Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains over their “sky high” energy consumption. I think we all knew this would eventually come despite the wide spectrum of clever rationalizations regarding Bitcoin’s energy use by its maximalists.

My initial thought was to pay off the mortgage of my new house but my interest rate is 4% currently so it seems like a bit of a waste to tie up cash. Given the volatility of the market, I was wondering whats a stable way of generating a consistent small return (&gt;3%) (e.g., DeFi bank account, a high yield savings account) to give me a cushion for bills and my current mortgage without tying it up for 30 years?

I'm maxed out on pretty much all my tax advantaged investment accounts (401k, Roth, HSA) + treasury bonds for this year. I also qualify as an accredited investor if that helps.

economy,Russia’s Party of War on close watch in the West,"The anti-war coalition of the West and its allies seeking to help Ukraine faces a variety of tasks. In particular, it is required to limit Russia’s long-term capabilities to pursue an aggressive foreign policy, as well as to contribute to the fall of the Vladimir Putin regime.

Immediately after February 24, sanctions were imposed on super-wealthy Russians. Firstly, this measure dealt a blow to Putin's inner circle, since in Russia, only those are able to raise huge money who are allowed to do so by the Kremlin. Secondly, it was a blow to the informal wallet of the Russian President. Thirdly, it responded to public demand. Bank accounts were arrested, assets were frozen, superyachts and luxurious mansions of oligarchs and the political elite were seized. This used to be top news worldwide but soon the media and public in the West somewhat lost interest in the topic.

However, the Russian opposition and the Ukrainian side have always considered restrictions against super-rich Russians to be insufficient. The Free Russia Forum, organized by Garry Kasparov, compiled a list of 1,500 people, designed to become the basis for personal sanctions. The list includes officials, businessmen, and propaganda pundits responsible for the usurpation of power, human rights violations, military aggression, and hate propaganda. Later, Aleksei Navalny's team with the Anti-Corruption Foundation drew their own list of 6,000 persons seen guilty of supporting the Putin regime.

In early June, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine announced that it had prepared a list of more than 12,000 Russians, who Kyiv would seek to be sanctioned. So far, Ukraine is working with partners in the West on a mechanism that will prioritize personal sanctions on all those who contribute to or are involved in Russia's aggression. According to the latest news, the EU member states, the UK, and the U.S. are closely studying the Russian ""party of war"", putting its members on record.

Thus, recently London included in the sanctions lists the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, Commissioner for Children's Rights under the President of the Russian Federation Maria Lvova-Belova, deputy of the Moscow City Duma Sergei Savostyanov, head of the Volga-Dnepr Airline Alexei Isaikin, representatives of the Kherson occupation administration, and several war criminals.

In turn, Berlin sent a signal to all Russian officials holding accounts and real estate or doing business in various EU countries. Thus, the German prosecutor's office seized three apartments and arrested bank accounts belonging to a deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation with the Communist Party, along with his wife. The decision was due to the fact that the Russian politician on February 23 voted in favor of recognizing the independence of the quasi-state entities ""DPR"" and ""LPR"" (recognized as terrorist organizations). Also, the German prosecutor's office filed a separate charge against the Russian deputy and his wife for violating the law by illegally renting out their real estate.

Thus, the West is bringing Russian society to the understanding that the restrictions will affect not only their top leadership and their close allies but literally everyone who supports the war against Ukraine. Also, by imposing personal sanctions, the West is trying to convince Russian citizens that speaking out against totalitarian tendencies in their country can later play in their favor.",finance,1656321291

Banking,Banking deposit (aggregate deposits) limit,"Hi Everyone,

I have a question about banks and the limit on total deposit some have. I have some guesses as to what they do this, but I have not been successful in finding a definitive answer online. Maybe I am searching the wrong key words. For example the Bluebird prepaid card has a $100k/yr limit. This seems self explanatory as it is a prepaid card. I want to say either Barclay, or Amex, or both savings accounts had limit of $5mm on total deposits in various accounts sav, cd, etc. I assumed when I first saw this it was due to the interest rate they pay. Capital one 360 and PNC bank virtual wallet  both state a limit of $5mm, this is more confusing as both are checking accounts, both limits refer to total deposits at the bank, not just in the checking, and neither checking pays an exceptional int rate. Capital one is .10 I believe and PNC is .01. Anyone out there know why these financial institutions would not want someone to have more than $5mm with them. I have some guesses like I said, but I have never found a specific answer. Thanks for any help.",finance,1656333724
personalfinance,Property Equity Confusion,"Hi everyone!

I've tried to do some research but admittedly am still a bit unsure about how equity works and was hoping someone could ELI5.

So the current situation is my sister has an investment property (based on similar size properties sold in the area I'd estimate the current value to be around $600,000) of which she has paid off approximately $280,000. My understanding is if the bank wants to work out the usable equity it'd be something like 80% of the property value minus the paid off amount i.e. equity of $200k.

So my sister and I want to use this equity to purchase a home for us to live in. As a hypothetical if we wanted to purchase a 1 million dollar home my understanding is we can use that equity as a 20% deposit (please correct me if I'm wrong here!). But so I have the following questions.

1. What exactly happens to the original investment property loan - by using the equity does it essentially get 'reset' so she starts paying the loan afresh and owes the bank 480k? Do the investment property loan repayments change in anyway?
2. Can we keep the original investment property loan and this new home loan separate? So kind of related to the first question but it doesn't become one big loan right? (Essentially my sister and I would like to keep it separate so that its easier for finance purposes).
3. Are there any downsides to using this equity? From the research I've done a lot of it has been people saying this is how they've grown their real estate portfolio but surely there a risks/negatives associated with doing this? If it works the way I think it does like I mentioned in question 1 I assume the increasing interest rates would mean you end up paying more interest for the investment property over the long run.

gaming,Remote Play - I want a friend to play on my PC - suggestions?,"Hey there! :)  


A friend of mine wants to play the Skyrim TC Mod ""Enderal"" and I want to record her playthrough.  


The way we do it right now is:  
1. I run the game  
2. She connects to my PC using 'Parsec' (Screenshare). That way she can use her Keyboard + Mouse as a remote way to control the character and play the game  
3. We use Discord to talk to each other and I stream my game there too so she has the game sound (she has to mute parsec, so she does not hear herself speaking which is annoying, so without sharing my game-screen on discord she would not have game sound)  
4. I open up OBS/SLOBS to record the gamefootage + our discord call so I have a nice video of her playing.  


The PROBLEM is, though, that her Internet is not the best, and thus she has a lot of artifacts and poor screen quality which makes playing the game hard at times.  


What option do we have to improve the experience?  
Is there other reliable and performance friendly programms to let her remote-play my game?  
   
I think that she has to ""download/stream"" the gamefootage twice (parces and then again on discord) is a problem as well.  But I did not find a way to prevent her hearing her own voice if we use parsec. (I stream my Desktop to her, so if she talks, my PC will play her voice, which then will be fed back to her, this is super annoying but I can't just cut out her voice I think, only mute the whole parsec program and then she wont have gamesound ... super frustrating!""

personalfinance,Free Credit Monitoring Tools such as WalletHub are Contributing to Identity Theft - Anyone Else Experience This?,"Identity theft and fraud is out of control. I thought I would share this with you all, especially since one of the tools I used to double-check I was not missing anything was the Identity Theft Wiki:  [identity\_theft - personalfinance (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) 

 \[Side note: something I would add to that wiki is to make an ID.me account - or just make an account with the IRS website - and then request an Identity Protection Pin for federal taxes, and then proceed with the steps in the wiki like freezing your stuff.\]

**I'll keep it as brief as possible but here is some context** \- earlier this year someone opened a mobile account at a store in my name with multiple devices on installment plans, and they had also **TOURED (in person!)** an apartment building and then submitted a rental application. They used a fake driver's license both times with my details but their picture.

I didn't know about the mobile account because those were soft inquiries (and I had reviewed my credit report like 2 weeks before all this which is a habit of mine and nothing was on there) but when this person applied for the apartment, the screening company did a credit check which was a hard pull, and I got a monitoring notification.

I was quick to act, and I got the building to deny the application after some back and forth, got the screening company to remove the hard inquiry (they wouldn't remove it completely but moved it to a soft inquiry which I was initially unhappy about but at least it didn't affect my credit score), the mobile carrier canceled the unauthorized account without any issue and at no cost to me, and I activated a free benefit at work for additional credit/ID monitoring (in addition to what I already had set up). All in all, I would say I was lucky.

Of course, I did other stuff first, like setting up a fraud alert and locking/freezing my stuff, setting up a federal IP pin, and alerting my financial institutions. And I filed the necessary reports and updated them as I learned new details.  

Lots of wasted time. I should have just frozen everything a while ago, kicking myself for not doing so. And I am someone who is pretty on top of their stuff, I have 2FA or MFA turned on for my accounts, keep sensitive stuff backed up on external encrypted storage, had credit/ID monitoring already, etc.

I thought that would be the end of it.

**This is the part that is absolutely WILD to me -** About a month ago I noticed soft inquiries on my credit report from **WalletHub**...I had no idea what that was, I reached out to them, but I could only communicate via email with them as no one was available by phone (even though they have a phone number it just refers you to an email address). I had to make an account so they would even help me (which I did). Basically, what I learned is that WalletHub offers free credit monitoring and credit advice. They also have targeted ads on their website for new credit cards, etc. which is how I assume one of the ways they may make money.

This person (or persons) set up credit monitoring with my identity, so they were able to see what is on my report such as where I bank/have lines of credit, previous addresses, etc. and they could also see my security alert and lock/freeze. Furthermore, they would get **NOTIFICATIONS** when something hit my credit, so they would know I had temporarily unlocked/unfroze my credit meaning they would have a small window of opportunity to commit fraud.  

Once having correspondence with someone at WalletHub and requesting them to look into a possible fraudulent account, **it took WalletHub 3 weeks to get back to me.** They did confirm that there was a fraudulent account made at WalletHub (of course, I saw the soft inquiries), and they said they removed this account.

**The kicker -** I asked if they could set up their system so that no additional accounts can be created in my identity...and their response was that they are ""improving their system to detect future fraudulent accounts"" and that I should continue to look for any alerts on my credit report from WalletHub...so basically, they didn't answer the question because I suspect the answer is no.

Folks, we are living in a time where anyone can set up free credit monitoring with your identity, learn where you bank, where you have lived, etc. and also get notified when you open new lines of credit and also when you freeze/unfreeze your credit. And companies like WalletHub enable it.

personalfinance,"My boyfriend and I are trying to buy a house, and I am wanting an outside perspective on our potential budget were we to buy one","A lot of people are saying not to buy a house with someone you are not married to. That is great advice. It is also prompting me to include this information: We have already met with a lawyer and have legal contracts outlining what would happen in the event of a breakup.

Where we live, houses and rent are extremely expensive and are only getting more so. We are renting right now and are looking into buying a house. We found one that is perfect for us. The only reservation I have is financially—buying an expensive house is daunting.

I know everyone's budget is different and ultimately it will be our choice, but I think it would be helpful to see outside perspectives so that we can think about this in a more well-rounded way. Here are some numbers:

* We make around $162,000/year together.
* Our monthly take-home pay is about $8,200 on average.
* Right now, we are paying around $1920/month for rent and utilities in a 2-bedroom apartment.
* The last time we renewed our lease, rent went up by $250/month and is expected to do so again were we to renew the lease in 4 months.
* Right now, after all of our mandatory bills, we have about $4,000 left over each month.
* The house we love is $510,000. (3 stories, 3 beds, 3 bathrooms, \~2,000 sq. ft., built in 2018).
* We were quoted a 4.875% interest rate.
* Our lender estimates that our mortgage payment, HOA fee, mortgage insurance, utilities, etc. would be around $3,900/month.
* Our other mandatory bills (car loan, school loan, gas, groceries, insurance, etc.) come out to around $2,250/month.
* That would make our monthly bills around $6,150/month, leaving us with around $2,050 left over each month.

My boyfriend looks at that budget and thinks it is absolutely manageable and we should jump right in and buy the house because ""we are literally throwing away money by renting"" and we could easily afford the house.

While I agree that renting is not the best thing ever, I wonder if the house and mortgage are too expensive for us and that we would be ""house poor"". Sure, we could afford it, but it would require a pretty drastic change in budget and lifestyle for us.

Are there any general guidelines as to what percentage of your monthly take-home pay your mortgage and utilities should be? What do you personally think of this budget?

personalfinance,Seeking advice about my car situation,"Hey all, hopeful to get some information and advice before I start any kind of pre approval process for a car loan.

I have a Honda with almost 200,000 miles on it that I’ve driven for 11 years. Over the past year and a half it has started to really nickel and dime me, but it’s got a few issues now that would be very expensive to repair. I have always had it regularly serviced, had issues checked out quickly, etc, but the condition of the exterior leaves a lot to be desired-a big gouge on the hood, the windshield is cracked, etc. I have always planned to drive this car until it wouldn’t go anymore, and I think that time has probably come.

About my financial situation. Im a non traditional college student (aka significantly older than all of my classmates). I will graduate undergrad in the beginning of August. The plan was to wait 6-12 months after graduation and then start looking for a car, but that’s not looking like an option anymore. I currently work part time but it barely covers my current monthly bills. I will graduate with no student loans but have a degree which I will need a masters to make a solid living, and so I expect to make about 50-75% more than I currently make once I graduate until I go to grad school.

The positive here is that I inherited a stock portfolio (currently worth about 400k) and have a good amount of cash as well. If I bought a mid range used car today, I could put 50% down and still have a decent emergency fund and money for the first couple of car payments until i have a new job. I do want to take out a loan for the other 50%. 

With my current income alone, I don’t see any way I would get approved for much of anything for a loan, but is it easier or more difficult to get approved if you’re using investments to demonstrate your ability to pay a car loan? Will I get a worse interest rate using those? I don’t plan to sell stock to pay, just demonstrate that i have the assets to do so. I have to have a car for work, school, and important Dr appointments. My car still runs, and if I put a quart of oil in every couple of weeks it’ll run a bit longer but I don’t know how much longer. Also, the AC is broken and it’s very hot and humid where I live. It feels like a big gamble to see if the car will go another 2 months and I’m miserable in it.

personalfinance,Would it be a good idea to sell my house?,"Hello,

I'm single in my mid 20's, and purchased my house in January 2020 for 270k at a 2.875% interest rate on a 30 year conventional.  I have paid more than required, so my loan is at about 240k remaining.

I am seriously considering taking advantage of the new value to sell, and buy again in the future using a VA loan.

I am currently in school using the GI bill, so finding work in the new state would not be a factor at this time.

If I were to sell, I would not have to find a house right away, as I have family with a room I can rent for the forseeable future.

personalfinance,New employer is offering to pay all of my closing costs if I choose to sell my home. Should I rent or sell?,"Some quick background, I (28M) bought a house in an extremely high-growth East Coast city about 3 years ago for ~300k @ 2.8% 30Y fixed-rate. Since then it has almost doubled in value. 2 of my neighbors have sold recently for just under 600k, and there are two more that just went up in the neighborhood for slightly over that. My current monthly payment is roughly $1700, including taxes, P&amp;I, insurance and HOA fee. A neighbor posted their house for rent a few weeks ago at $2.5k/mo and it was under lease within 3 days.

I just got a job offer that requires relocation. I'm definitely taking the role. With that being said, my employer's relocation package includes paying up to 70k (or 10% sale price, whichever is lower) towards the closing costs for a home sale (including realtor fees, title fees, taxes, inspections, etc). I looked up the cost of selling my house at its currently estimated value and the relocation package could save me roughly 40-50k cash (pre-tax) in the home sale alone. That's pretty hard to turn down.

The problem is that the area I live in is forever increasing in price. It's pretty sought after due to having convenient access to major highways, being 15-20 mins from 2 cities, and being surrounded by good schools &amp; shopping areas. The houses sell within 24 hours usually, and even with the interest rate hikes, that has barely slowed. I could see myself moving back to the area in 5-10 years, albeit that would be spouse dependent. And there's always the possibility of things changing.. If I sold now, even if I tried to buy the house back &amp; put all of profit in as a down payment, my monthly would jump $700. If the rates keep going up, I would essentially be pricing myself out of the area. Some of the new homeowners in my area (just met a new family this past week) are paying double of what I am, and seem glad to be here. It seems crazy to sell, with the high potential of the price to keep increasing, negating any of the profit long-term. Couple that with the increasing interest rate and I feel like I'm losing a great opportunity by selling.

So I could:

* **Sell:** for 200-300k profit (profiting an additional 40-50k that I otherwise would've had to pay), rent and reassess in 5-10 years, just dealing with the increased COL then.

* **Rent** for $800 profit per month (not including any repair costs or prop. management fees), keep my low interest rate and reassess in 5-10 years. If I go this route, I miss out on the coverage of my closing costs &amp; I risk my house depreciating in value during the coming years (upcoming recession?)

I'm torn both ways. Any suggestions?

Edit: I plan on renting at the new location (estimated $3k/mo). I have enough saved to pay the monthly on my current house for 12 months (not including any estimated income from tenants). With the new job, I would be able to afford both the new rent + the mortgage on my current home, with about $1-1.5k left over for everything else.",finance,1656346541

stocks,$TSLA DD: competition won’t effect demand or gross margin,"TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain unlimited demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --&gt; $3750 --&gt; $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --&gt; higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain unlimited demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins.

personalfinance,Pros and Cons of Debt Settlement?,"I've got around 38k in credit card debt, and with rents rising the payments are getting harder and harder to keep up with. 
I never wanted them to get this high, but with medical issues my husband is going through we had little choice. 

I'm trying to find the best way to work through paying these off so we have some hope of buying a home (hopefully in the next 5 years), but my credit score and debt to income ratio are too heavily affected by this debt. 

I went through a consultation and application with National Debt Relief and basically came to the conclusion that I could pay them ~550 a month to pay off this debt (negotiated down) in the next 4 years, instead of paying the minimum balance every month ~860 and not getting anywhere because of the interest. 
I'm aware that the settlement will negatively impact my credit until it's paid, but I don't know how hard it'll be to rebuild my credit after the debt is gone.
They state there's no downside to paying off the debt early once it's negotiated (so it could be less than 4 years, especially if my husband's issues become resolved). I understand I'll have a little more money in my pocket every month that I can save, but the thought of not having a credit card for ""just in case"" makes me panic a little. 

I don't want to miss the opportunity to start nailing this debt down, but I'm afraid I'm misunderstanding something and it'll negatively impact me for the next decade. 

Can anyone give me some pointers? Most loan consolidation loans will not cover the full amount, though I'm considering a loan for 20k as it'll pay two of the cards and has a lower interest rate than each one. It's monthly payment is higher than what I put on those two cards currently though, so that's the hangup. It forces me to pay in 3 years (this company has no pre-payment penalty).

investing,"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications","TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --&gt; $3750 --&gt; $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --&gt; higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car. Union labor is way, way more expensive than Mexican labor. 7500 alone is a huge moat to cross when you're not profitable with that 7500 subsidy.",finance,1656357248
stocks,Ford Won’t Let You Buy Out Your EV Lease at the End,"Is this Ford's attempt at getting into a VaaS (Vehicles as a Service) model, an attempt to compete with the Stellantis acquisition of Free2move a car sharing service...or simply a buying opportunity to sell their vehicles twice.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

[Article Link](https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-wont-let-you-buy-out-your-ev-lease-at-the-end)

Lessees of new Ford electric vehicles may not be able to buy their leased vehicles at the end of the term, according to a letter sent to dealers. The letter tells dealers in 34 states that leasing customers may not buy out their vehicles at the end of the lease, and that 17 additional states (including the District of Columbia) wouldn't offer buyouts by the end of this year.

The new rules take effect Wednesday for dealers in those 34 states, although it's unlikely that interested lessees can snap up a Mach-E or F-150 Lightning with an option to buy out before then. Ford dealers stopped taking orders for those in-demand SUVs and trucks in April.

A Ford Credit spokesperson told me the logic behind ending lease buy-outs was a push by the automaker toward sustainability, although the financial incentives for Ford Credit could be considerable.

Residual values for used cars have skyrocketed in the past two years, which may be too tempting for Ford Credit to pass on if that trend continues. Ford now offers a balloon-financing program that largely mimics a lease, with a buyout, refinance, or trade-in with equity-earned options at the end of 36 months, albeit at a higher interest rate than outright purchases with financing. Like a traditional lease, the balloon-financing program caps mileage for buyers. Unlike a lease, the balloon-financing payment program transfers title to the buyer, which would make them eligible for a [federal tax credit](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/36860/cheap-electric-cars-wont-happen-in-america-until-we-fix-the-federal-tax-credit) and any applicable state incentives.",finance,1656357545

stocks,"Choppy Week Ahead; Inflation, Spending, and Consumer Confidence Updates on Deck","Stocks turned lower Monday afternoon after opening higher. 

The second quarter is winding down and earnings season looms ahead. This created a choppy trading environment Monday, which could extend throughout the week as money managers rebalance portfolios for the quarter to come.

Despite a likely choppy week without a clear headline that the market mulls over for multiple days - like with Fed meetings - there will still be some key economic reports worth a follow. The biggest reports will come Thursday via the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index and the Personal Income &amp; Outlays report.

Other key reports are the Consumer Confidence report Tuesday morning and the ISM Manufacturing Index update on Friday.

Inflation &amp; Spending
The PCE Price index is expected to have ticked higher in May to a monthly rate of 0.7%, with the core reading expected at a 0.4% rise. This follows slight gains of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.
A half-point tick higher to the headline figure's monthly pace, which includes volatile prices such as food and energy, should be no surprise. During the month of May, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate rose 9.3% - so a jump should be expected.

Reactions to this report will come down to, was it better or worse than feared? Further, how broad were the price increases?

The May CPI report, which sparked this most-recent selloff, had troubling signs as broad price increases extended to products like used cars and new vehicles, which - at the time - were predicted to soften. Add price increases in shelter, food, and energy, and the peak inflation narrative all but disintegrated.

On the Income and Spending side, what we are watching for is resilience. Income and Spending are both expected to rise at a monthly rate of 0.5%.

Personal spending has stayed steady in the face of inflation, but, in the zero-sum game we are playing, that's come at an unsustainable cost as the personal savings rate continues to erode - currently at 4.4% after finishing December at 8.7%.

The spending and income side of the BEA’s report will be extra interesting this time around after comments last week by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. The Bullard justified his opinion that it's too early to talk about a potentially-looming recession as resilient spending is being powered by $3.5 trillion in unspent Covid aid, which he believes will buoy spending and the economy.

Consumer Confidence
Unspent Covid aid is all fine and dandy, but consumers have to have some amount of confidence in order to be willing to part with it.
A study out of MIT showed that most Americans didn’t spend the first economic impact payment - except those who had no choice but to spend it.

Consumer Confidence is expected to have continued its decline in June, with estimates set for a decline to a reading of 101.0 - from May’s reading of 106.4.

It will be interesting to see what comes from here. A recent report from the LendingClub Corporation (LC) showed that a third of individuals making over $250,000 per year are living paycheck to paycheck. The lower and middle-class ranges are currently at 79.9% for those earning under $50,000, and 63.8% for those between $50,000 and $100,000.

In order for the unspent Covid aid to keep spending afloat, people need to continue to feel secure enough to partake in discretionary spending. The interesting question is, at what point does spending slow/stop by the people that still have some room to spend?

The more financially conservative and/or frugal individuals - who probably have a lower bar for ceasing spending activity - likely make up the bulk of those who still have some of those Covid funds.

That doesn’t mean the Bullard is wrong for pointing out unspent Covid aid as an anchor point for the economy, but it does underscore the need to keep things from getting much worse than they currently are as we don’t know where the breaking point is for those people.

The Rest
Briefly, the ISM Manufacturing Index is expected to expand at a slower pace with a reading of 55.0% in June. The prices index eased for its third straight month in the last report, while respondents to the survey remained optimistic over demand.
Meanwhile, earnings will pick up this week, but the real flood won't begin for a couple of weeks.

Nike (NKE) and Trip.com (TCOM) will kick us off after market close today. Keep an eye out for comments regarding changing consumer spending habits, pickups in trip cancellations, and supply chain updates. Travel was supposed to have a robust summer, while Nike and other retailers could benefit from the Lipstick Effect.

General Mills (GIS) and Constellation Brands (STZ) will be important updates as the respective food and adult-beverage companies could have further price increases in store.

Basically, the tool will generate and email you daily reports on your portfolio. I have a lot of ideas on what data to track and how to paint a useful picture with this data.

Some aspects of DeFi that I am tracking are LP tokens, staking, lending/borrowing etc.

Detailed breakdowns of these aspects and perhaps some calculated insight/recommendations into each of your positions. Things like exploring impermanent loss and judging the risk, fees earned from providing liquidity, and what your claimable rewards are. 

This provides a way to have a detailed snapshot or receipt of your portfolio at a point in time, so no more screenshotting before you redeem some reward…

I think building a historical picture - how the positions have changed over time- is very important for managing your portfolio effectively. So providing historical data for prices, interest rates, rewards etc. is something I value.

personalfinance,Where to keep downpayment money when buying a house won't be feasible for a long time?,"Hello everyone, prices listed here will not make sense since I am not in the US, but I'd like some perspective. I've been saving for a downpayment since I started making money 10 years ago (28 now) but I didn't actively start adding to it up until 3-4 years ago. My finances look like the following

Savings:

* 10k for downpayment
* 2.5k emergency fund
* 2.8k for retirement
* 200 in crypto
* 1k in varios index funds

Income/expenses (monthly)

* 900 income after taxes (1.1k before taxes)
* 200  (dirt cheap because we are renting from family members, market price is 400)
* 100 utilities + services
* 200 groceries + take out
* 100 cats
* 100 therapy
* 100 saved for retirement
* Other miscellaneous that might be needed
* Rest saved for downpayment

The apartments I am looking at are in the 100 to 150k range. 4 years ago an apartment was worth 40-60k and now its at 80-100k. In my country the most you can get financed is 90% but that's hard to find. Due to the pandemic they are now only accepting 80% financing with at most 20/25 years. I've simulated online, and  an 80k loan requires me to have a 2k monthly income and the dividends would be 500. I am not there, so I know for a fact I can't get a loan. Needless to say, buying a property is out of the question for the near/distant future given how prices have risen in our area.   


Currently I have the downpayment money in a certified deposit or term deposit with a monthly interest that varies but that is currently at 0.78% (\~0.2 pre pandemic) . I searched and that was the best interest rate I could get without adding risk to the money. I don't think I will be able to afford a loan for more than five years, so where would it be ideal to leave the money? Move it to a low risk index fund or leave it where it is at now? I am scared that the interest accrued will be less than the inflation of real estate. I am at the same spot as 4 years ago when it comes to the percentage of the value of the property I have saved.  


Right now I am the only breadwinner in a two person two cat household. But next month my partner starts making money and I will be able to save more. The thing is we hate where we live (mold, ceiling leaks when it rains, it's like a sauna in the summer and freezing in the winter, not the safest of places, etc...) and the idea is to rent somewhere else after 2-3 months with the new income where we are at right now. In the new area we want to rent the rent will be 300-400 dollars more expensive than it is now but it would still allow us to save more money than we are currently.   


My idea is with the added income to contribute 200 to my retirement to cap a bonus our state gives us, and the rest to go to saving and entertainment/hobbies because right now I don't spend any money on something that is to relieve stress.

I recently received 5 quotes, 2 are from a company I used with solar at my last house (#4 &amp; #5 in the list, also they were the only ones to come out to my house for initial quote, so they will probably be the closest to reality). I'm in the Seattle area. 

I'm way out of touch on recent improvements in solar so I'd love some feedback please!  I do have some shading issues due to trees owned by my neighbors, so it's not as perfect as my last house.  Usage is approximately 10,000+kwh (assumed once I get EV). I appreciate your thoughts and any education you can throw my way, thank you!

personalfinance,Pay off HELOC as only non-mortgage debt or invest if behind?,"Hello. To start, my background is: married, both 31, current retirement values are $2500 for mine, $11,000 for her. Our only ongoing debt outside of our mortgage is our HELOC which is at $30,300, 6% current interest rate.

personalfinance,Pandemic tanked credit - need help saving house. Any help appreciated.,"My husband and I had 25 years of great credit prior to the pandemic. We are self employed and have government contracts. During the pandemic, the govt shut down caused many offices to be very understaffed or closed altogether so our new contracts were stalled. We contacted our creditors and went through the process that they allowed to skip a few payments with no damage to our credit. We knew we'd be right back on track within 2 to 3 months, and we did get right back on schedule with payments. 

However, the creditors did NOT keep their end of the bargain and we were left with late payments against our credit score. This lead our creditors to lower our credit limits by half or more (even creditors we weren't late with) which created the double whammy of late payments AND high utilization and tanked our credits scores from the the low 800's to the 500's! We rely on the credit cards for the slowest paying government offices that can sometimes push payments out by months. Not having this credit cushion while awaiting payments has now made us behind with some creditors again, including our mortgage.

So our credit is BAD and being self employed with slow paying income doesn't make for an easy sell for a consolidation loan. We have roughly 120k in personal and business debt.

What we DO have is 1 investment home that is paid for and worth $250k. We also have our primary residence with a mortgage of $137k but worth 850k. I'm using very conservative figures for value. Our primary residence would not sell quickly or we would have done that long ago. I'm looking for ways to utilize our equity.

A conversation with a mortgage guy suggested using a reverse mortgage as a short term solution and to refi out of it after we patched up our credit, which I hadn't even thought of. I've also looked at some of the equity sharing companies and possibly some non conventional lenders.

I'm obviously too close to this to see it as clearly as I should. Anyone with useful experience/advice?",finance,1656382279

personalfinance,irs settlements advice,Anyone know anything about getting an irs settlement or lessening the amount or the payment plans. The company I worked for changed my exemptions within my taxes towards third quarter last year. So when I filed iowed back a lot. I know tons of people that have had issues like this and settled or used a company that settled for them but the irs instantly nailed on penalties and extra bs. All of my extra money is currently in the crash stockmarket so that would be a horrendous loss to pull to use at the moment. I don't want to start dealing with or paying a settlement company when so many are known for scams and not as legitimate as others. It's unbelievable how the federal government can put employees and military paychecks on hold during their budget negotiations for endless amounts of time and hold refunds for whatever amount of time they want with no consequences but I pay my taxes the wrong amount is paid suddenly and it builds up beyond my means to pay back in a month's notice and they throw every penalty and threat at me under the sun.

42. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
43. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

46. Reports are also coming in that the Biden Administration crypto plans due in August will target Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains over their “sky high” energy consumption.

&gt; Stock futures rose early on Tuesday following a losing day as the market attempted to keep its rebound from the bear-market lows going.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 208 points or 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures edged up 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The overnight action followed modest losses on Wall Street as a comeback rally stalled. The blue-chip Dow fell about 60 points, while the broader benchmark, the S&amp;P 500, dipped 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7% on Monday. The major averages rallied last week, posting their first positive week since May as major averages rallied off their lows for the year. The S&amp;P 500 is still down 18% on the year but is up more than 7% from its low hit in mid-June.
*****
&gt; “One of the trickier calls in this business is evaluating the difference between a bounce in a bear market vs. the start of a more durable advance,” wrote Chris Verrone, technical analyst with Strategas. “The current bounce, +8% over the last 4 trading days, has been impressive on the surface as most moves of this context tend to be, but again has yet to signal any resounding internal or leadership improvement.”
*****
&gt; On Tuesday China relaxed its Covid restrictions for inbound travelers, cutting their quarantine time upon arrival by half to seven days. That gave travel and casino stocks a lift in premarket trading. Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands rose more than 6% each. American, United and Delta Air Lines all added more than 1%.
*****
&gt; Several major banks raised their dividends in response to successfully clearing this year’s Federal Reserve stress tests, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. JPMorgan and Citigroup, however, said increasingly stringent capital requirements forced them to keep their dividends unchanged.
*****
&gt; Morgan Stanley shares gained nearly 4% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Investors will monitor more data on Tuesday including June consumer confidence and April home prices to gauge the health of the economy. Fears of a recession have increased lately as the Federal Reserve tries to combat surging inflation with aggressive rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “Market bulls who have had the rug repeatedly pulled out from under them this year may understandably be suspect of the rally, since many of 2022′s upswings have quickly given way to fresh lows and this time may be no different,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading at E-Trade.
*****
&gt; Shares of Nike edged lower in pre-market trading even after the sportswear company topped Wall Street’s earnings and sales expectations for the fiscal fourth-quarter despite a Covid lockdown in China and a tougher climate for consumers in the U.S.
*****
&gt; Despite last week’s bounce, the S&amp;P 500 is down nearly 14% in the second quarter, on track to post its worst quarter since the first quarter of 2020, at the depth of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The bounce from the bear market lows is a welcome change, though slowing economic growth and lack of capitulation among investors has many skeptical of the durability of the recovery,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research.

stocks,ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood says the U.S. is already in a recession,"Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/28/ark-invests-cathie-wood-says-the-us-is-already-in-a-recession.html

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said Tuesday that the U.S. is already in an economic downturn, and she admitted that she underestimated the severity and lasting power of inflation.

“We think we are in a recession,” Wood said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Tuesday. “We think a big problem out there is inventories... the increase of which I’ve never seen this large in my career. I’ve been around for 45 years.”

The innovation-focused investor said inflation has turned out to be hotter than she had expected due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks.

“We were wrong on one thing and that was inflation being as sustained as it has been,” Wood said. “Supply chain ... Can’t believe it’s taking more than two years and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine of course we couldn’t have seen that. Inflation has been a bigger problem but it has set us up for deflation.”

Inflation measured by the consumer price index rose 8.6% in May from a year ago, the fastest increase since December 1981.

Wood said consumers are feeling the rapid price increases, reflected in sentiment data that’s fallen to record lows. She pointed to the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, which showed a reading of 50 in June, the lowest level ever.

The popular investor has had a tough 2022 as her disruptive technology darlings have been among the biggest losers this year in the face of rising interest rates. Her flagship active fund Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is down a whopping 52% year to date, falling 66% from its record high set in February 2021.

Still, Wood said her clients are mostly sticking with her and new money is coming in as investors seek diversification in a down market. ARKK has had more than $180 million in inflows in June, according to FactSet.

“I think the inflows are happening because our clients have been diversifying away from broad-based bench marks like the Nasdaq 100,” Wood said. “We are dedicated completely to disruptive innovation. Innovation solves problems.”",finance,1656420701

I am looking for a way to monitor a not very big cloud infrastructure (AWS) (a few dozen servers at most) but which could increase and decrease rapidly in number of servers.

I'm already using Prometheus/Grafana on a single server. And even though I know that Prometheus can read and write remotly and has the federation system. I have the feeling that it is quite complicated and not very scalable.

Do you have any free/open-source infrastructure monitoring alternatives? Or a way to do it with Prometheus? Or if simply federation is sufficient?

CryptoCurrency,More Hedge Funds Are Betting Against Tether as Crypto Melts Down [WSJ],"Short sell­ers have been ramp­ing up their bets against tether, the world’s largest sta­ble­coin, amid a broad mar­ket sell­off that has called into doubt the fi­nan­cial health of some crypto com­pa­nies.

In the past month, more tra­di­tional hedge funds have ex­e­cuted trades to short tether through Gen­e­sis Global Trad­ing Inc., one of the largest crypto bro­ker­ages for pro­fes­sional in­vestors. These trades are worth “hun­dreds of mil­lions” of dollars in no­tional value, said Leon Mar­shall, Gen­e­sis’s head of in­sti­tu­tional sales. He de­clined to be more spe­cific.

“There has been a real spike in the in­ter­est from tra­di­tional hedge funds who are tak­ing a look at tether and look­ing to short it,” Mr. Mar­shall said in an interview.

Tether is a sta­ble­coin, which are vir­tual cur­ren­cies that are sup­posed to be pegged to the dol­lar or other na­tional cur­ren­cies, and it is the most widely traded in the world. Teth­er’s mar­ket cap stood at about $67 bil­lion on Fri­day, according to Coin­Mar­ket­Cap data.

Gen­e­sis, which doesn’t take a view on tether, said the short trades are al­most exclusively put on by tra­di­tional hedge funds in the U.S. and Eu­rope, while crypto firms—es­pe­cially those based in Asia—have been happy to fa­cil­i­tate the other side of the trans­ac­tions.

A num­ber of in­vestors have been bet­ting against tether for at least 12 months. But more hedge funds got in­ter­ested in short­ing tether af­ter the col­lapse in May of an­other sta­ble­coin, Ter­ra­USD, ac­cord­ing to Gen­e­sis.

Ter­ra­USD is a so-called al­go­rith­mic sta­ble­coin, which means it doesn’t have to be backed by real as­sets. Other more tra­di­tional sta­ble­coins, in­clud­ing tether, say they hold $1 of cash, Trea­sury bills or other tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial as­sets for each unit of sta­ble­coin.

Tether briefly lost its peg dur­ing the Ter­ra­USD col­lapse in May. It traded as low as 95 cents on May 12, re­flect­ing in­vestors’ con­cerns about the value of its assets and whether they would be read­ily con­vert­ible to cash in a mar­ket panic. It has since re­cov­ered and is now close to $1.

There are two main fac­tors dri­ving hedge funds to short tether, Mr. Mar­shall said, cit­ing con­ver­sa­tions that he has had with clients.

Some hedge funds are short­ing tether as a bet about the broader econ­omy. The Fed­eral Re­serve is rais­ing in­ter­est rates to curb 40-year-high in­fla­tion, scar­ing investors away from riskier as­sets in­clud­ing cryp­tocur­ren­cies.

Other hedge funds are con­cerned about the qual­ity of the as­sets back­ing tether. Tether says it main­tains an equiv­a­lent amount of re­serves that in­clude com­mer­cial pa­per—or cor­po­rate short term loans—bank de­posits, pre­cious met­als, gov­ern­ment bonds and digi­tal to­kens.

Tether has faced in­tense reg­u­la­tory pres­sure over its re­serves. Tether and re­lated en­ti­ties reached an $18.5 mil­lion set­tle­ment in 2021 with the New York at­tor­ney gen­er­al’s of­fice, which ac­cused them of mak­ing sev­eral pub­lic mis­rep­re­senta­tions re­gard­ing the dol­lar re­serves back­ing tether. They didn’t ad­mit or deny the al­le­ga­tions.

Some short sell­ers say they be­lieve that most of teth­er’s com­mer­cial-pa­per holdings are backed by debt-rid­den Chi­nese prop­erty de­vel­op­ers, The Wall Street Jour­nal pre­vi­ously re­ported. Tether said in a blog post this month that “these rumors are com­pletely false.” The com­pany added that it has been re­duc­ing its port­fo­lio of com­mer­cial pa­per.

A tether spokes­woman said the firm wouldn’t com­ment fur­ther on “how hedge funds are look­ing to gen­er­ate re­turns by cre­at­ing ar­bi­trage op­por­tu­ni­ties on the ba­sis of these ru­mors.”

Teth­er’s mar­ket cap has been de­clin­ing since it briefly lost its $1 peg. It is down about $16 bil­lion since a peak on May 5, ac­cord­ing to Coin­Mar­ket­Cap data.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You own 1/3rd of a house worth $350,000. You have the chance to buy the other 2/3rds by taking out a $250,000 loan to cover the house, closing costs, and necessary renovations. You continue to rent it out in the future for $1,600/month. This investment starts now for the purpose of this calculation.
2. You could sell your portion of the house for $117,000 now-minus any taxes. The remaining amount after taxes would be put in a conservative investment vehicle and would be used as a down payment on a house 2-7 years in the future.

Bitcoin,4 Reasons Bitcoin might fail according to Nic Carter,"[https://youtu.be/0ugo4NncjvM?t=4420](https://youtu.be/0ugo4NncjvM?t=4420)

His 4 reasons:

1. Bitcoin becomes de facto proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake wouldn't be added to the code, however, large exchanges would end up running their own mining operations to keep minting new blocks because the 'security budget' (block rewards) would become too little to sustain a large ASIC industry. Meaning: not enough reward fees per block (and the newly generated coins would be too few because of many halvings).
2. Some huge bug. Would be recoverable, but need to restart the ledger to a prior point in time.
3. Quantum threat. Nic believes we might be underestimating the pace at which quantum computing is moving. Elliptic curve signatures as well as Schnorr signatures would be imperiled. Coins with revealed public key addresses are quantum vulnerable (e.g. Satoshi's coins). If quantum supremacy suddenly happened, the blockchain would need to be halted, updates implemented etc. Messy.
4. A good algorithmic stablecoin. With an algorithmic monetary policy that's more reactive to the economy, would allow for something more price stable.

He estimates the percentage chance of every threat in the 5-10% range, so about 25% in total that one of these end up happening.

personalfinance,Balance Transfer to CC or Personal Loan?,"Hello Personal Finance Reddit...

I've been looking at opening a Wells Fargo Reflect Credit Card for a while now, due to their 0% APR for 18 months incentive (could be up to 21 months if I paid on time every month, which I always do).

The primary reason for this card would be to make two balance transfers and pay down some credit card debt with 0% APR (most preferable) or at a way lower interest. One is $5,800 with AMEX/Macy's credit card (25.99% APR, $12,500 limit) and the other TJ Maxx/Mastercard at $5,750 (27.24% APR, $12,000 limit). These are my two biggest credit card balances. Both have racked up significantly due to interest. I opened these cards not being fully experienced or aware of high interest charges, and used them both for emergency.

I have already done a balance transfer from my Home Depot to a US Bank VISA Platinum credit card, and I've been paying at 0% APR for about half a year now, looking to pay it off before the promotion is up next July. I really liked doing this transfer, as I have paid down this debt without interest pretty quickly. I opened the US Bank VISA Platinum card in November 2021 and had been waiting a while to open another card (they say to open a new credit card about 6 months after).

I had been doing a lot of research on balance transfers, and would like to do the same with the AMEX and Mastercard by opening the Wells Fargo Reflect card at $12000. I currently pay $300 every month on both cards, so if I paid the same about each month without interest, I figure I can fully pay it off within the 21 month introductory period.

However I think I shot myself in the foot by opening an Ulta/Mastercard in May this year with a $7,000 credit limit (that's what they approved me for... only used it for a $100 purchase). It gave me a small hit as a low impact hard inquiry on my credit.

*A little about my financial profile:* I work full-time, I've only ever rented, never owned a home or property. Other loans I have include federal student loans at $17,500 (which have been put on hold until September). I also have an auto loan through Wells Fargo at $4,900 on an installment plan since February 2020. All my accounts have been in good standing, always pay on time, making my payments above minimum payment most times and paying in full sometimes (this is one of my faults). Never gone into collections or into bankruptcy. Oldest credit card is 10 years old. FICO credit score 767 as of 06/27/22. Annual income is $36,000.   

* (Total open balances: \~ $36,024, credit card balances $13,300, total credit card limits $53,901)

So dear Personal Finance Reddit.. I would really like some of your input on this... 

Would opening this card bring my utilization down significantly? Should I open it at a higher limit instead? Should I wait a little longer to open this card? Maybe take out a personal loan to consolidate the debt on these two cards instead? Thank you!

You can't combat a 9% Inflation with their proposed 3.5% rates by end of year and even that is questionable right now in this form.

Unless there are other tools used the FED will need to raise rates to over 6% at least to make any significant change in the inflation and yes there has to be changes because simply Joe Biden can't go into an election with inflation shooting up.

personalfinance,Can Someone Help Me With A Offer Letter Question. My Math Keeps Coming Up Wrong.,"Pay rate is $42 p/hour on offer letter.

Company equates that to $87,360 p/year on offer letter. I was told this includes no overtime except for the 1 hour OT built into our 9 hour shifts.

Schedule is 9/80. Every Mon-Thurs shift p/month is 9 hours. 2 Friday shifts p/month are 8 hours. 2 Fridays are off. All Saturday and Sundays are off.

Paychecks are Bi-Weekly

This is all calculated without consideration to federal/state tax.

CA OT laws states than anything worked after 8 hours a day is paid at 1.5 times hourly rate. 16 days per month I would have at least 1 hour of OT built into my schedule.

Here is what I calculated:

* M – T x 4 p/month = 16 (9 hour days) = 144 hours
* F x 2 p/month = 2 (8 hour days) = 16 hours
* Working 18 days p/month
* Total 160 hours p/month = 16hr OT &amp; 144 hr RG
* 16 hour OT = ((42 x 1.5) x 16) = (63 x 16) = $1008
* 144 hour RG = (144 x 42) = $6,048
* Monthly total = $7182
* Per paycheck = $3591
* 26 paychecks p/year x $3591 = $93,366

My understanding is that $42 p/hour on a 9/80 schedule equates to $93,366 p/year. I'm not sure how they wound up with $87,360.

I doubt my math skills are better than the company accountants but I can't make sense of how their math works based off the hourly rate, the schedule and the yearly amount.

I also plugged my numbers into the following paycheck calculators with the same information and state but got varying answers.

**EDIT: This is NOT a 40 hour standard work week. All the engineering staff and technicians are run on a 9/80 compressed schedule which equates to 1920 hours work per year.

solar,Quote Comparison - Upper Midwest ~16 kW system,"We just bought our ""forever"" house last fall and are having it re-roofed in the next month or so. I thought it would be a good time to explore solar so I've been collecting quotes. I've gotten quotes from 6 different companies and now it's time to actually make a decision! I'd love some input.

A little background: our estimated annual usage is \~13.5 kWh. We are planning to switch to EVs in the next 2-5 years, so would like to oversize the system to accommodate (or at least partially offset) that increase in usage. We live on a pretty wooded lot, so our southern facing roof needs to have trees cut back and/or removed for solar to make sense. We are happy to do this as much as we can. Some trees are on the neighbors property line, but we have a good relationship with them so I'm not overly worried about us being able to trim/remove as needed.

**Quotes:**

Company 1: 16.77 kW system at $2.54/watt, estimated output of 18,972 kWh.  39 x Hanwha Q CELLS 430 panels, Inverters are Enphase IQ7A.  $42,596 cash price

Company 2: 15.8 kW system at $2.79/watt, estimated output of **12,381 kWh** (will circle back to this later). Hanwha Q Cell modules, Enphase inverters (don't have the specific version listed) and ironridge racking. $44,082 cash price.

Company 3: 16.99 kW system at $3.23/watt.  43 x REC 395 panels, Enphase IQ8A inverters. Cash Price $54,960

I assume company 2 is being extremely conservative in their production estimate. I do know that given our latitude and having more trees around in general, the winter production will not be great. That being said, it seems a little strange that their estimated production is *so* much lower. I am currently leaning towards Company 1, but wonder whether their equipment stacks up. I would slightly prefer black on black panels, but given the price difference I can probably get over it.

Any thoughts would be appreciated!

Forex,Why does the EUR/USD interest rate parity not hold true?,"Quick explanation of interest rate parity: Interest rate parity says that if the base currency has a lower deposit rate than the foreign currency then we can expect the forward value of the base currency to be higher than the current value compared to the foreign currency.

More in depth explanation: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/interes-rate-parity.asp

In the current environment the eurozone has 0% interest rate. Meanwhile the US has a much higher 1.75% interest rate. Therefore we can expect the euro to appreciate in value compared to the dollar to cancel out the 1.75 risk free return of a euro based loan.

In recent months quite the opposite has happened. The euro has lost an extreme amount in relation to the dollar. My question is why did this happen, and can we predict the failure of the IRP to work in the future and profit with the arbitrage strategy?

personalfinance,Any way around home loan seasoning requirements?,"Quick backstory, my wife and I bought our home in February 2020 and refinanced in April 2021. We currently have about 13% equity in our home and therefore have PMI on our loan. Our interest rate is just over 3% so we don’t want to refinance.

I’m sure that we are not the only people interested in this with the rapid increase in home prices across the nation. My wife and I, as stated, have about 13% equity in our home based on the last appraised value last April. I looked into having our home reappraised and having the results sent to our mortgage servicer to have our PMI knocked off if we proved to now have more than 20% equity in our home based off of the new appraised value. Homes in our area have gone through the roof and based on comps in my area I’m positive a re-appraisal would put us well above 20% equity. I was told by my mortgage servicer that we cannot move forward with removing PMI in this way until we meet the loan seasoning requirements of two years, which would put us around next April. 

I’m wondering if anyone knows of any loopholes around this. We’ve been in our home for more than two years but unfortunately the origination date after our refinance was last April, resetting our loan seasoning requirements of two years of making payments. I’m positive that a reappraisal of our home would put us well above a 20% equity mark and would really like to knock off PMI as soon as possible since we’re paying roughly $170 a month and would put that money straight into principal saving us thousands in interest over the life of our loan.

I understand the seasoning requirements are there to protect the lender, but is there anyway that between a reappraisal of our home, or potentially even showing that my wife and I have both received significant increases in salaries over the last year since our origination date is there anyway to move forward with a reappraisal to remove PMI and circumvent the seasoning requirements other than a refinance?

Has anyone had any luck with this?

Thank you very much in advance for any advice!

The accounts have already been setup as your balances were on May 31st with a cooling off period at July 31st, to get yourself situated.

Prime used to have two subdivisions within it with the boundary being $250k between all qualifying accounts.  However, these subdivisions will now become their own divisions. This also eliminates the home mortgage 10% counting toward the qualifying balance.

Prime checking - From 20k to 250k; $25 if balance is not met

Premier checking - 250k and higher; $35 if balance is not met

Initially the sub-divisions were seamless, if you happen to cross the $250 mark you would get the extra benefit.  If you went back down, you would lose the extra benefits.  Now if you go below $250k, you will get charged $35 a month until you get back up.

After looking at the options here are the differences.  For me the only big thing is the unlimited No ATM fees from any ATM if I went down to Prime.  I can still do one US and one international per period, which is one month.

personalfinance,Please critique my financial plan,"Hi all, first time poster here.

For context, I’m a mortgage officer so I’m pretty well versed in finance but wanted a 3rd party opinion to poke any holes in my seemingly hole free plan.

I’m getting solar panels installed on my home. No down payment, 20 year loan not attached to my property that is assumable by a potential buyer in the future, .99% interest rate. Monthly payment is $136 for the first 16 months, after the first 16 months if I didn’t take my tax credit and apply it to the loan it goes to $187.

I’m planning to not put the money toward the loan because the rate is so low to me it seems super ineffective. So I plan to use this money to remodel my home, I’ll have about 14k to use from the tax credit.

With the remodel and the addition of the solar panels I can request a re-evaluation of my home to remove my PMI that is $150 ish a month saving me more money, I don’t want to refinance because I have a 2.5% interest rate.

All in all it seems solid to me. Thoughts?

TIA.",finance,1656454140

The tech told me she was scared it was rabies and they could try and treat it for other things but that would cost $5000+ and I don’t have that kind of money (I already paid them $800 to do the blood tests because I wanted to make sure that nothing could be done for him) so she gave me the option to surrender it to them and she said they could try and reach out to their rescues to help him or if not, surrender it to the county. I feel bad because maybe I should’ve just let him die in my yard feeling comfortable instead of being subjected to this only to be put down in an unfamiliar environment when all he’s known is outdoors. But then what if he has something transmissible that he could give to other stray cats? Did I make the right decision? Is it possible it is vestibular syndrome and they’re going to euthanize him for no reason? He was walking earlier in circles and he did weakly try to fight me when I put him in the carrier.

personalfinance,Is short term investing safer or riskier?,"Hi, I know the title of the question seems silly. I think I'm pretty decent with money, but am getting weirdly confused by a very simple seeming contradiction and want someone to phrase the answer to help me out.

It is well known that buying and holding stocks over the long run is safer than over a short run, due to volatility in the short term. Naively, one would conclude here that long term investing is safer than short term investing as it mitigates volatility.  


However, things are less likely to change over the short run than over the long run, which is why short term bonds are safer than long term ones: the near future is more certain than the far future. You can trust the company/government will likely be in the same capacity to pay you over the short run, the same can't be said over the long run and therefore you incur more risk in long term bonds. This would make it sound like short term investing is safer than long term investing.  


So now I feel dumb cause I'm trying to help educate my s/o on personal finances, but can't seem to explain **why short term investing is risky for stocks but safe for bonds**. 

The only reason I can come up with is that in the long term, stocks are expected to go up in value, whereas interest rates are less predictable and therefore bonds don't have an expected change in value.. But I don't think that's it, is it?",finance,1656459208

personalfinance,Advice on elderly mother and credit cards (should she just default?),"My mother (79) is needing to move on to assisted living. She gets Social Security, some retirement, and alimony from my dad. We thought we had her finances in order and then she springs that she has 2 credit cards ($3000 and $4000 balances) with about $300/month in payments. She already declared Chapter 7 about 6 years ago (in Tennessee).  I'm thinking you can only do that every 10 years (don't know if that's a TN thing or Federal.)

What if she just stopped paying them? She's done with credit. It doesn't matter what happens to her credit. I know other places like car insurance pull those things, but that's the price she may have to pay. 

I could be completely wrong, but I assume they can't seize her social security. Would they really go after a 79 year old aggressively?

stocks,I thought I was a stock picking wizard until 2022 came,"Going into 2022 with portfolio pretty much full of growth tech / biotech hasn't been pretty so far. 
Lost about half from that glorious top last year. Better than Cathie Wood though, yay! BTW remember 2020? Everyone loved Cathie. Genomic revolution, yada yada. Now everyone hates Cathie of course. ARK will probably be around for a while, but Zoom is not going to $1500 by 2026. Are you kidding me, Cathie?! Fire those interns aka ""analysts"" asap. 

Ok, enough about Cathie. So after 20/21 marvelous returns (around 100% combined) I thought..holy s***, this is great, I got this...going to pay off my wife medical school loan earlier (a tip: *don't marry anyone with medical school loan debt*), maybe we will get bigger house, you know, man can dream (well now at 6% interest rates plus houses being ridiculously overpriced this is not happening regardless of how stock market is doing).  

Then 2022 came... Well, I shifted a good chunk of portfolio into GOOGL/AMZN from growth last year, about 20% allocation, but that didn't help much. Biotech in particular has been in BRUTAL bear marker ever. Btw average investor should NOT touch biotechs, especially small cap ones. But if you want to gamble and lose money anyway in the end, sure, go ahead and invest in biotechs, especially development stage ones. 

What I learned though during this bear market, *well energy or big pharma bros would say, what bear market are you talking about*, that your conviction absolutely helps you to hold on to equities during steep corrections. If you did enough due diligence and know what you own, you most likely will stick around even after &gt; 50% decline. If you bought something on borrowed conviction, then most likely you are shaken out by this time. 

Hang in there folks, better times will come, unless of course you bought oversized position in Teladoc or Carvana on top 😬
Bear markets are unavoidable. We just need to be mentally prepared for those. Macro bros / FCF ""experts"" / perma bears think we are going way lower. The thing is that *nobody* knows. I continue DCAing at this point. I won't catch a bottom and I don't need to honestly. Also all sectors do NOT decline equally as well. If SPY corrects other 20% from here that does not necessarily mean that XBI for instance will follow.

Trading,How are OTC forward rates determined?,"Hi,

I am a software developer for a company that has an OTC desk dealing in the PGM markets. I wrote a trading platform for them which is basically a very advanced blotter. I am hoping you can give some answers to this old code monkey.

For their entire book/forward position they mark the value of each OTC contract against a single price. I know this is not how future contracts are priced. I believe that it is common to price forward contracts against some kind of interest. For those that have experience on OTC trading desk how do you determine these interest rates to mark a contract for something that is 1 week, 30 days, 75 days, 1 year etc.

I posed the question of simply marking the contracts against the NYMEX/COMEX exchanges but they said that contracts with long expiry date in the futures market have such low liquidity that the pricing is unreliable (perhaps I misunderstood though)

P.S for clarity when I say 'mark' I mean how the the underlying asset is priced to determine the current profit/value on a given forward contract.

personalfinance,What should I do about an upside down car loan?,"I have never posted on Reddit before but am hoping you all can help me here! This situation is about my partner, who is horrible with money and I’m trying to help them out of from under some of it. 

So here is the situation:

She has a 2016 Audi Q5 that she bought used in ‘18 and still owes $19,700 today with ~11% interest rate (she had horrible credit back then). The car needs new breaks, which would likely cost $1-2k depending on the extent of the damage, potentially more. 

According to KBB, the car could be traded in for $17-18k or sold to private party for ~$20k. 

Given the current car market, would the best path forward be to try to renegotiate the interest rate with the lender somehow, pay for the breaks, and keep the car for as long as possible? What if the lender can’t lower the rate?

Or should we try to get out of it with as little damage as possible (eg trade in) and start over? If we were to sell or trade in and start over, should we consider a lease for now instead of buying something new to avoid going upside down again? Her credit is ~730 now, much better than it was back when she bought this car. 

Let me know if there is any other info I could share that’d be helpful. I’m not great at personal finance either, just trying to figure out what to do!

UPDATE: thanks for all the advice!! We will definitely keep the car - shop around to get the brakes replaced for a more reasonable price and keep up the maintenance (we already do but will do better) &amp; try to refinance the loan. Appreciate all the recommendations!",finance,1656465777

The TSA put a medical charge on my account for federal insurance even though they fired me before the plan started. Nobody let me know I owed money until I checked my credit report months later. They had been reporting a negative balance of $302 every month (it's been years of this showing up on my credit report) I didn't know what this bill was for initially so I called up many people within the government and the USDA National Finance Center.

31. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss. Two big eUTxO advantages to understand here relate to concentrated liquidity and fee determinism.

42. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
43. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

45. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources. It’s been obvious this was coming for a while ever since the reports of mining operations dumping hot waste water into the finger lakes and affecting the ecology. In a place like New York, that kind of thing won’t go unnoticed.

46. Reports are also coming in that the Biden Administration crypto plans due in August will target Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains over their “sky high” energy consumption.

56. Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill.

stocks,Oil superprofit: will it continue or not?,"The anti-war coalition of the West and its allies are constantly discussing how to limit the superprofit that the Russian Federation makes from energy exports. In particular, possible mechanisms for limiting prices for Russian oil and gas were discussed at the summit of the heads of the G7 member countries. The idea itself is unanimously supported by all seven leaders, however, they recognize that a lot of work will have to be done to implement it. 

At least one of the options is to limit the access of Russian counterparties to such a service as insurance of Russian oil supplies. However, if the US, Canada and the UK can go for it easily, then the EU could be in trouble, as decisions must be made by all 27 member states.

France proposes to ensure an increase in oil production on the world market, which will reduce oil prices in general and revenues from the sale of Russian oil in particular. To do this, it is necessary to negotiate with the Arab sheikhs, as well as return to the markets such countries as Venezuela and Iran, which are now under US sanctions.

The US and Italy are proposing to set ceiling prices for Russian oil. The problem with the effectiveness of this measure is that if it is supported by an insufficient number of countries, the Russian Federation may find new buyers for its oil in other markets (for example, in Asia).

In addition, the US insists on increased control and transparency in the maritime oil transportation market. We are talking about the fact that some countries do not transport Russian oil on tankers under their own flags to other countries. For example, this issue was recently discussed by the Ministers of Finance of Cyprus and the United States Konstantinos Petrides and Janet Yellen. It should be emphasized that it is Cyprus that is one of the largest players in the maritime transportation of ""black gold"". K. Petrides expressed concern about such a step for the reason that many other countries have not imposed sanctions against the Russian Federation. Therefore, if Cyprus refuses to transport Russian oil, Moscow will simply turn to Mexico, Venezuela or other countries.

Thus, the key to the success of both mechanisms that the West and its allies are currently discussing - setting a price limit for Russian oil, as well as control and transparency of maritime transport - is the participation of as many countries as possible in them. The higher the level of international solidarity in the confrontation the Russian totalitarian state, the more effective will be the restrictive measures introduced to deprive Putin's neo-empire of excess profits from the sale of hydrocarbons.  It is worth recalling that the US, Canada and Great Britain have already imposed an embargo on Russian oil, and the EU has approved a gradual phasing out of energy from the Russian Federation. Even if Russia continues to sell significant amounts of energy to China and India, it will no longer be able to easily plug its financial holes with revenue from these two countries.",finance,1656484487

CryptoCurrency,How bad will things get in fall/winter?,"So I'm just going to go ahead and be a negative nancy here. I believe it is only a matter of time until Russia shuts off gas to europe completely, which will cause chaos in the winter and cause a recession that will ripple throughout europe. I also believe that it will fire up inflation to even more extreme levels, which will cause tensions to rise up between the more in debt southern EU states and the rest again, because in order for them not to collapse the ECB will not rise the interest rates anywhere to what the FED will do, thus the rest having to burden heavier inflation due to the south.

I also do not see the Ukraine war ending other than military ""victory"" by Russia, Russia declaring victory after fully capturing the Donbas, or Russia collapsing. All of which I would not expect to happen until maybe next year, atricious grind for both until then. Unless we get the collapse scenario, the relationship with Russia will remain that of an enemy and there will not any energy relief, meaning normalization can only happen once an alternative system (sufficient LNG imports, selfmade production, sufficient alternative energy sources in Europe) has been firmly established, which will also take time.

So realistically, under this very negative but unfortunately also quite realistic scenario, are we basically fucked until maybe 2025? I feel like we haven't reached anywhere near the top of escalation yet and basically winter is 99% going to be terrible.

And how low can crypto go this winter when things escalate? We already dropped massively in the last months and weeks. Is the fall/winter escalation and likely recession already counted in?

CryptoCurrency,A Detailed Summary of Every Single Reason Why I am Bullish on ETH in 2022.

This is the third updated version of this post since the [first one I made in 2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jhrqv1/a_detailed_summary_of_every_single_reason_why_i/)

#This is an extremely long post. If you just want the hopium without the detail, read the TL;DR at the bottom.

#~~ETH 2.0~~ The Merge

The switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake also known as “The Merge” (formerly known as ETH 2.0) has numerous enormous benefits for Ethereum. These include: 

- A 99.9% increase in power efficiency, making Ethereum by far the largest environmentally friendly blockchain.
- Greater network security than PoW provides due to efficiencies with PoW and the new ability for the protocol to “slash” or punish dishonest validators/attackers.
- An ~80-90% drop in ETH inflation from around 5%pa to well below 1%pa and these inflation numbers are excluding ETH burned from transaction fees which based on recent fees will turn ETH into a deflationary asset. This will reduce the current daily sell pressure of $20,000,000/day of new ETH being sold by miners to offset electricity costs to just $2,000,000-$5,000,000/day going to stakers who will sell less due to not having any significant operating expenses to pay off. Furthermore, these stakers won’t even be able to withdraw their earnings until after a later hard fork months after the merge.
- An increase in ETH 2.0 staking rewards from the current 4-5% to [possibly as high as 7.5-15% due to miner/validator extractable value and network fees/tips.](nitter.snopyta.org/drakefjustin/status/1384124998084792324) ^(The 25% value in that tweet is out of date and no longer likely.)

At this rate, the merge will go live later this year, likely in September. Lately there has been a series of successful shadow forks for merge testing as well as the Ropsten testnet which has successfully switched to Proof of Stake.

#Extended Ethereum Roadmap

The extended Ethereum roadmap includes a wide range of very promising and forward thinking features which will keep Ethereum on the bleeding edge of blockchain tech for a long time. The roadmap was recently outlined by Vitalik and along with the aforementioned merge upgrade, it includes the following categories:

- **Surge:** Scalability for rollups through data sharding. This effectively allows rollups to scale another 100x from their current levels.

- **Verge:** Introduces stateless clients which means the blockchain can be verified without needing the complete history of the blockchain which came before it. This allows validators to run without the need for a large hard drive, dramatically reducing the hardware requirements to run a node, thus improving decentralisation.

- **Purge:** Technical debt elimination and elimination of historical data. This comes in multiple forms such as historical data expiry, state expiry and the removal of numerous other unnecessary functions. Much of this will make node operation and validating much easier as well as simplifying the wider Ethereum codebase.

- **Splurge:** Numerous miscellaneous upgrades such as proposer builder separation, account abstraction and zkSNARK-ifying everything. These will further lighten the load for node operators and give smart contract wallets more functionality.

It is worth noting that these upgrades won’t all rollout together under the above names like the merge. The above names are simply categories for different upgrades. These upgrades within each category will come at different times.

#EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity

As I covered a while ago in [a previous post of mine,](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/) ETH doesn’t have a supply cap like Bitcoin. Instead, it has a monetary policy of “minimum viable issuance”, not only is this is a good thing for network security, but with the recent addition of EIP-1559, net ETH issuance is variable due to its fee burning feature. During times when network demand is high, transaction fees can rise to levels at which the amount of fee revenue being burned is greater than the inflation rate from new ETH issuance going to miners (and stakers post-merge). In effect, this fee burn acts a lot like a company such as Apple using profits to perform share buybacks, except instead of Apple using money from selling iPhones to reduce the supply of Apple shares, Ethereum is using the profits it makes from selling scarce, decentralised block space to reduce the supply of ETH. This creates a constant negative supply side pressure which without a matching reduction in demand, will lead to ETH price appreciation.

So what does this mean for ETH scarcity? It means that if the Ethereum economy is healthy and there is a constant demand for Ethereum’s scarce, decentralised block space, there will be a sink in the form of the fee burn which reduces the supply of ETH. If the fee burn is high enough, the fee burn can outweigh the new issuance being minted for miners and stakers. This threshold is around 100-150 Gwei under Proof of Work and around 10-15 Gwei post-merge/under Proof of Stake.

The long term prediction for ETH supply according to Ethereum researcher Justin Drake is that supply will peak just before the merge just below 120 million ETH before decreasing post-merge where over time the burn will lessen relative to new issuance before ETH supply eventually floats around 100-120 million ETH or continues to decrease at a slow rate. You can create your own post-merge issuance models by playing around with the variable inputs on [ultrasound.money.](https://ultrasound.money)

#Layer 2 Scaling

One of the most under appreciated aspects of Ethereum is its forward-thinking rollup centric scaling roadmap which is sometimes referred to as a “modular blockchain” architecture. Meanwhile many “Ethereum killers” or alternative layer one general purpose blockchains are still trying to scale with the outdated “monolithic blockchain” architecture and are having to compromise on one of the three elements of the blockchain scalability trilemma, scalability, decentralisation and security. But I won’t go on about this, I’ll let u/Liberosist convince you about the superiority of [Ethereum’s rollup centric roadmap and the modular blockchain thesis.](https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d) What’s important here is that this model of scaling effectively flips the blockchain scalability trilemma on its head, allowing Ethereum to scale, become more decentralised and secure all at once.

Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups have been live on main net Ethereum for a while now. Arbitrum and Optimism have a very wide range of DApps and can offer transactions for less than a dollar and token swaps for not much more, all while retaining the Ethereum main chain’s security guarantees. Meanwhile, ZK rollups such as ZK sync offer even cheaper transactions at less than 10¢ per transfer with full Ethereum base layer security. Finally, rollups are only just getting started. There are many optimisations which have been proposed and will soon roll out such as EIP-4488 and call data compression. Together, [these could boost throughput and cut fees by as much as 50x.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/r26hhv/rollupcentric_ethereum_roadmap_november_2021/) As previously mentioned, rollups flip the blockchain trilemma on its head, meaning that the more people that use them, the cheaper they get and the more secure Ethereum becomes!

#DeFi and Composability

If you’re reading this, I am sure you are aware of the phenomena which is Decentralised Finance (AKA DeFi or more accurately, open finance). Ethereum was the first and is still by far the largest platform to offer permissionless and immutable financial services which when interacting with each other, lead to unprecedented composability and innovation in financial applications. A whole new world of possibilities are opening up thanks to this composability as it allows anyone to take existing pieces of open source code from other DeFi projects, put them together like lego pieces (hence the term money legos) and create something the world has never seen before. None of this was possible before Ethereum because typically financial services are heavily regulated and FinTech is usually proprietary software, so you don’t have any open source lego bricks to build off and you have to build everything you need from scratch. That is if what you want to do is even legal for a centralised institution!

#NFTs and tokenisation

NFTs or “Non-Fungible Tokens” – We’ve all heard of them by now. This once niche aspect of the Ethereum community has exploded into the mainstream through almost unprecedented hype and speculation in the modern era. Since then, they have received a lot of flak, and in some cases, rightfully so. The reality is that the future is not buying a JPEG of a cartoon ape which gives you nothing more than commercial rights to said JPEG and being able to flex your ownership of this NFT to others. The NFTs which have staying power and create real value will be the ones which have utility. This could be something directly practical like an [ENS name](https://ens.domains/) which allows you to use a human readable address for your wallet such as vitalik.eth, or it could be something more innovative and subjective in its value like a community token released by a musician which gives you many perks like private groups, special deals and even financial benefits such as tokenised song royalties.

#Institutional Adoption

Ethereum is by far the most widely adopted blockchain by enterprises. Ethereum’s [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) (EEA) is the largest blockchain-enterprise partnership program and Ethereum is by far the most frequently leveraged blockchain for proof of concepts and innovation in the blockchain space by enterprises. Meanwhile, there are protocols like the [Baseline protocol](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/) which is a shared framework which allows enterprises to use Ethereum as a common frame of reference and a base settlement layer without having to give up privacy when settling on the public Ethereum mainnet. This framework makes adopting Ethereum much easier for other enterprises. Another example is EY’s “Nightfall”, a Zero Knowledge optimistic rollup which provides full privacy and cheaper transactions for enterprise use.
 
#Institutional Investment

This latest bull run was characterised by the beginning of institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Exposure to the space is becoming easier and easier for large institutions with custodial firms for institutional investment and hedge funds exposed to crypto offering their products left and right. But it doesn’t stop there with Ethereum. As businesses transact on Ethereum and better understand it, not only will they buy up ETH to pay for their transactions, but they will also realise that much like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a scarce asset. Better yet, a scarce asset which offers yield when staking. The first major mover in this field is Cloudflare who [recently announced](https://blog.cloudflare.com/next-gen-web3-network/) that they are buying and running their own staking nodes to help secure the network.

#Improvements in user onboarding and abstracting away complexity

Ethereum has started making huge leaps forward in terms of usability for the end user. The aforementioned ENS names is a huge UX improvement which is equivalent to the huge leap forward for the internet which was DNS. No longer do you have to check every character of your ugly hexadecimal 0x43AB96D… ETH address to ensure you’re sending your ETH to the right person. Another major improvement is the advent of smart contract wallets like [Argent wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/). Argent allows for users to access their wallets and interact with DeFi self-custodially from an app on their phone without having to record a private key or recovery phrase. Instead, they offer social recovery and their UI is straight forward enough for anyone who uses a smart phone to understand. Finally, for the more experienced users, DApps like Uniswap have pretty, super easy to use graphical user interfaces and can be used by anyone who knows how to run and use a browser extension like Metamask. While at times the Metamask UX still has a way to go to get to mass adoption levels of user friendliness, there have been improvements in the last year such as EIP-1559. EIP-1559 has removed the old gas price guessing game and subsequent waiting for an uncertain length of time for your transaction to be accepted. Metamask has also added a feature which allows you to switch networks to other chains or L2s in once click instead of having to manually add the RPC endpoints.

The user experience will continue to get better until it gets to the point where it is just like email today. So easy that even your grandmother can tap a couple of buttons and use DeFi without even knowing anything about how it works.

#The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer

One of Ethereum’s biggest threats is for it to be overthrown by a so-called “Ethereum killer” blockchain which claims to do everything Ethereum can do and sometimes more. However, one of the biggest hurdles to overthrowing Ethereum is finding consensus over its biggest competitor. Ethereum is by far the biggest, most decentralised and politically neutral smart contract platform which gives it a snowball effect of attracting most of the new users and builders in web 3.0. Furthermore, this gives it a stamp of legitimacy which other projects don’t have.

The best way to measure the adoption of a layer 1 chain is to compare the fee revenue. This is because blockchains sell block space and the fee revenue is the sum of money which people are willing to pay to access that block space. Ethereum’s fees in the last 24 hours (while I am writing this) total $3.9 million. Compare this to BNB (a network which doesn’t try to compete with Ethereum as a truly decentralised platform) which had $600,000 in fees in those same 24 hours. The next largest smart contract platform (one which actually claims to be decentralised) is Avalanche at just over $30,000. This means that Ethereum provides 100x the value to its users than its closest true competitor does. Source: https://cryptofees.info/

#Network effects

This is another topic which I made a [previous post on.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/guffdj/the_network_effect_is_king_what_i_have_learned/) The network effect is why Bitcoin is still the number one cryptocurrency and by such a long way. Bitcoin is not the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency. However, it has the most widespread name recognition and largest market cap. The network effect is also why most people use Zoom and Facebook Messenger/WhatsApp despite the existence of free, private, end to end encrypted alternatives which have all the same features (https://meet.jit.si/ for a Zoom alternative and Signal for the private messenger app. I highly recommend both. Let’s get their network effects going!). It is the same for Bitcoin. People have heard of Bitcoin and many understand it already. Many people don’t want to have to learn about or set up a wallet for alternative options. People like what is familiar and what other people use. Nobody wants to be “that guy” who makes you download yet another app and account you have to remember the password/private key for. In the same way, Enterprises don’t want to have to create a bridge between their existing systems and a dozen different blockchains. Developers don’t want to have to create DeFi money legos from scratch on a new chain if they can just plug in to existing services like Uniswap and AAVE. Likewise, users don’t want to have to download another browser extension to use DApps on another chain if they already use Ethereum. This is also why the vast majority of Ethereum killers are effectively just Ethereum clones with different specifications. The reason for this is of course because it is easier to build and onboard new users and apps if the experience is familiar and developers can port over existing applications rather than build them again from scratch.

#Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform

Ethereum is also the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform. Unlike some of the competing smart contract platforms, you can’t round up everyone at the Ethereum Foundation or any select group of people and expect to be able to stop the network. Not only this, but the Ethereum foundation doesn’t have the ability to print more ETH or push through changes on a whim like some people would lead you on to believe. The community would reject detrimental EIPs and hard fork. Ever since the DAO hack, the Ethereum community has made it clear that it will not accept EIPs which attempt to roll back the chain even to recover hacked funds (see EIP-999).

Attacking Ethereum’s Proof of Stake beacon chain would be extremely costly and require a very large amount of money or influence over staking entities. In its current state, an attacker would need to control 66.7% of the &gt;400,000 validators on the beacon chain to control the network. At the current moment, even the largest four custodial staking providers such as Coinbase and Kraken only add up to 34% of the total stake.

Finally, with the US dollar looking like it will lose its reserve currency status and the existing wire transfer system being outdated, superpowers like China won’t want to use US systems and the US won’t want to use a Chinese system. Enter Ethereum, the provably neutral settlement layer where the USA and China don’t have to trust each other or each other’s banks because they can trust Ethereum. While it may sound like a long shot, it does make sense if Ethereum hits a multi-trillion dollar market cap since it will be the most secure and politically neutral way to transfer value between adversaries. Not to mention if much of the world’s commerce were to be settled in the same place — on Ethereum — then it would make sense for governments to settle on the same platform. While this future is a long way away, it is very much a possibility.

#ETH distribution is decentralised

Thanks to around 7 years of proof of work — a system where miners have to sell newly mined ETH to pay for electricity costs — newly mined ETH has found its way into the hands of everyday people who buy ETH off miners selling on exchanges. As pointed out by u /AdamSC1 in [his analysis of the top 10K ETH addresses](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) (I highly recommend reading this if you haven’t already), the distribution of ETH is actually slightly more decentralised than Bitcoin with the top 10,000 ETH wallets holding 56.70% of ETH supply compared to the top 10,000 Bitcoin wallets which hold 57.44% of the Bitcoin supply. This decentralised distribution means that the introduction of staking won’t centralise ETH in the hands of a few wallets who could then control the network. This is an advantage for ETH which many proof of stake ETH killers will never have as they never used PoW to distribute funds widely throughout the community and these ETH killers often did funding rounds giving large numbers of tokens to VC investors.

#The community

Finally, while I may be biased, I think that Ethereum has the friendliest community. Anecdotally, I find that the Ethereum developer community is full of forward thinking people who want to make the world a better place and build a better future, many of whom are altruistic and don’t always act in their best interests. Vitalik is one of the best examples of this. Vitalik holds less than 0.3% of the total ETH supply, a remarkably small percentage for any founder of a multi-billion dollar company or cryptocurrency (for reference, Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon and Satoshi owns about 5% of all Bitcoins). Not to mention his many charitable donations, including $1 billion dollars worth of SHIB sent to the Indian COVID relief fund (sure, there wasn’t $1 billion worth of liquidity in those SHIB tokens but it’s still a hell of a lot of money) and $5 million to aid in Ukraine among many other charitable donations. Compare this to the much more conservative, “at least we’re safe while the world burns” attitude which many Bitcoiners have. I don’t want to generalise too much here as the Bitcoin community can be great too and there are some wonderful people there. But the difference is clear if you compare the daily discussion of r/Bitcoin to the incredibly helpful and welcoming daily discussion of r/EthFinance who will [happily answer your noob questions without calling you an idiot and telling you to do you own research](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/jh3zyy/daily_general_discussion_october_24_2020/g9vg1jw/) (there are plenty more examples in any of the daily threads). Or the very helpful folks over at r/EthStaker who will go out of their way to help you set up an Ethereum beacon chain staking node on the mainnet or testnet. Don’t believe me? Head over to those subs and see for yourself.

**Please don’t hate on me if you disagree about which project has the best community, it is just my very biased personal opinion and I respect your opinion if you disagree! :)**

#TL;DR: 
- **The Merge** - A ~ 90% drop in ETH issuance, beginning the era of deflationary ETH, AKA [ultra sound money](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FDyjJE5u.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1). Furthermore, staking yields will rise post merge. Plus, the merge starts the more secure and more environmentally friendly future of Ethereum.
**Extended Ethereum Roadmap** - The surge, the verge, the purge and the splurge offer a wide range of benefits and features which will dramatically increase Ethereum’s capabilities.
- **EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity** - Ethereum is now the first actually profitable blockchain which doesn’t need constant inflation to pay for network security. This translates to ETH the asset actually remaining scarce and the Ethereum network secure.
- **Layer 2 Scaling** - Rollups and a “modular blockchain” architecture flip the blockchain trilemma on its head to allow Ethereum to scale while maintaining, or even increasing security and decentralisation. 
- **DeFi and Composability** - Money legos and open source code allowing for fast development and unprecedented innovation in the world of finance.
- **NFTs and tokenisation** - Tokenise everything. No, seriously. NFTs will be so much more than just art NFTs.
- **Institutional Adoption** - Ethereum has the most enterprise partners (EEA) + the Baseline protocol and Nightfall are bullish AF. 
- **Institutional Investment** - We have seen the beginning of institutional acceptance of crypto as an asset class but understanding is still very poor. It is a matter of time before more yield chasing institutions discover ETH, the deflationary, dividend paying/stakeable, environmentally friendly, more advanced version of Bitcoin.
- **Improving UX and abstracting away complexity** - Human readable addresses and smart contract wallets which even your mother could use. Even MetaMask and DApps are getting easier too.
- **The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer** - No ETH killer clearly sticks out from the rest. This makes it hard for one of them to create a big network effect. Furthermore, their actual value created is more than 100x lower than Ethereum’s.
- **Network effects** - Ethereum has by far the largest network effect and as Bitcoin has shown us, the network effect is extremely important.
- **Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform** - Super secure under Proof of Stake, no more tolerance of DAO like forks and a neutral platform for geopolitical adversaries on the world stage to settle on, removing the need for them to have to trust each other’s banking systems.
- **ETH distribution is decentralised** - Years of proof of work have put ETH in the hands of many. In fact, ETH supply is more decentralised than the supply of Bitcoin.
**The community** - Super duper mega friendly. Shoutout to r/ETHStaker and r/ETHFinance!

economy,Oil superprofit: will it continue or not?,"The anti-war coalition of the West and its allies are constantly discussing how to limit the superprofit that the Russian Federation makes from energy exports. In particular, possible mechanisms for limiting prices for Russian oil and gas were discussed at the summit of the heads of the G7 member countries. The idea itself is unanimously supported by all seven leaders, however, they recognize that a lot of work will have to be done to implement it. 

At least one of the options is to limit the access of Russian counterparties to such a service as insurance of Russian oil supplies. However, if the US, Canada and the UK can go for it easily, then the EU could be in trouble, as decisions must be made by all 27 member states.

France proposes to ensure an increase in oil production on the world market, which will reduce oil prices in general and revenues from the sale of Russian oil in particular. To do this, it is necessary to negotiate with the Arab sheikhs, as well as return to the markets such countries as Venezuela and Iran, which are now under US sanctions.

The US and Italy are proposing to set ceiling prices for Russian oil. The problem with the effectiveness of this measure is that if it is supported by an insufficient number of countries, the Russian Federation may find new buyers for its oil in other markets (for example, in Asia).

In addition, the US insists on increased control and transparency in the maritime oil transportation market. We are talking about the fact that some countries do not transport Russian oil on tankers under their own flags to other countries. For example, this issue was recently discussed by the Ministers of Finance of Cyprus and the United States Konstantinos Petrides and Janet Yellen. It should be emphasized that it is Cyprus that is one of the largest players in the maritime transportation of ""black gold"". K. Petrides expressed concern about such a step for the reason that many other countries have not imposed sanctions against the Russian Federation. Therefore, if Cyprus refuses to transport Russian oil, Moscow will simply turn to Mexico, Venezuela or other countries.

Thus, the key to the success of both mechanisms that the West and its allies are currently discussing - setting a price limit for Russian oil, as well as control and transparency of maritime transport - is the participation of as many countries as possible in them. The higher the level of international solidarity in the confrontation the Russian totalitarian state, the more effective will be the restrictive measures introduced to deprive Putin's neo-empire of excess profits from the sale of hydrocarbons.  It is worth recalling that the US, Canada and Great Britain have already imposed an embargo on Russian oil, and the EU has approved a gradual phasing out of energy from the Russian Federation. Even if Russia continues to sell significant amounts of energy to China and India, it will no longer be able to easily plug its financial holes with revenue from these two countries.",finance,1656488812

personalfinance,Buying I Bonds with Student Loans?,"I'm going to be a 2nd year dental student who has quite a bit of loans taken out at interest rates of 5.28% for Direct Unsubsidized and 6.28% for GradPlus Loans. I was wondering if it would be smart for me to purchase I-bonds considering the fact that I-bonds are currently at an interest rate of 9.62% and that they can be deemed tax exempt when paying for higher education. I also understand that the rate of the I-bonds is set to change in October and that I would fork up 3 months interest in the event that I cash out before 5 years. However I have a feeling inflation is still going to be a major problem in the next year, thus keeping the interest rate on I-bonds relatively high.

Would it make sense for me to purchase some I-bonds given the fact that interest rate of the I-bond is higher that what my current student loan interest rates are at?",finance,1656495683

CryptoCurrency,Time to buy: few advice on how to buy and what to buy.,"First stop this is not a financial advice. And no I am not gonna tell you what exactly to buy but rather how to choose and on what basis.












After few calm weeks BTC started to dive again today. Most alts are around 10% down. It looks like a good opportunity to buy. 
But considering all the risks I want to suggest few advices:

















1. Buy coins which are less risky and more legit:
This is not a good time to buy high risk new projects. Market is down and many smaller projects might not survive further downtrend. Buy something you see Essential for crypto. If bear market ends you can bet your ass you will make some solid profit as everything, even top coins, are so far behind their ATH. This is the good thing about buying low.














2.I know all of you are sick of hearing this but, DAC:
Trying to call this market is extremely risky. Just DCA. For all we know (which is nearly nothing) market can keep going down.


















3. Check if coin you are buying has stacking ability or any other passive APY:

A no-brainer. Bear market might be here to stay. You want some method of maximizing your profit while you are waiting for market recovery (if ever).

















4. Avoid holding stablecoins:
Remember UST? Afraid of USDT? Waiting to see what feds gonna do about stablecoins? All the reason not to hold stablecoins in large amounts. 


















5. Be afraid of ""too good"":
If your coin has APY of more than 20% IMHO it is unsustainable and is a risk. If it is much higher it is most likely a flat out scam or Ponzi.

For example, are there futures contracts/options on total return of bonds, eg for the well-known ICE BofA US Corporate Index: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLCC0A0CMTRIV#0](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLCC0A0CMTRIV#0)

**Analogy with stock index futures**

For stock indexes like the SP500, Nasdaq, etc there are futures contracts that make it possible to take leveraged futures positions that closely correspond to the price changes + dividends that an investor would have received had they invested directly in each of the component stocks of the index, for example the ES futures contract for the SP500 index, and all of the economics of owning the component issues (eg the dividend payments) are priced right into the futures price.

Is there a corresponding set of products for bonds/notes/bills total return indices? Looking for a product that allows:

1. performance that would mimic the interest/coupons plus the price changes of the underlying fixed income assets with interest/coupons and price changes built right into the futures price, like they are for stock index futures
2. low transaction costs, as is usually the case with futures
3. efficient/inexpensive leverage, as is also usually the case with futures

personalfinance,"$7,500 Personal loan for credit card debt?","So I know that it is bad to take on mote debt to get rid of debt, but I am debating on doing it. I have two credit cards. One is about $7500 with 19.99% APR and the other is $2000 with 24% APR. I am getting rid of the $2000 one first with the help of my boyfriend and should be paid off soon, my concern is my $7500.

I want to take out a personal loan for it because it would take me forever to pay it off with the interest rates. Side note I took out a cash advance on this card for $1000 with 25 APR for rent one month (I know, very stupid idea but we need a roof over our heads). I know people use personal loans for credit debt all the time, but would this really be a bad idea? I have stopped any charges on either cards. It is hard for me to throw extra money each month towards the cards, but I am working on getting rid of unnecessary expenses and lower monthly bills.",finance,1656505764
personalfinance,"Credit Card Debt Help, Please","Good morning, everyone! I am here to politely ask for your help and opinions, so let's jump right into it!

I have about 25-25.5k in credit card debt. Insert sad trombone. Reason for that was a handful of irresponsible spending, some unfortunate circumstances, and a dash of extended job search, but I digress.

That amount is split across two cards. Card 1 has a balance of 20.5k @ 14.9% interest, Card 2 has a balance of 4.9k @ 13.65% interest.

My income *now* is roughly 97k annually, so obviously it is time to pay all that off. First, though, I have a few questions. 

My instinct is to start paying down the first card as aggressively as I can manage, however, I was wondering if it would be better to pay off the smaller card first, and then do balance transfers of 4-5k at a time from the higher card to the lower? Now that I typed that out, it sounds silly, but y'all are experienced here, so I'd like do hear your input. 

Additionally, I have an account with my military bank (USAA) that is offering long term personal loans that can be used to consolidate my credit at a lower interest rate. They're offering 25.5k over 60mo @ 8.39% interest, leaving me with a $522/mo payment that I am able to throw more money towards the principle on.

At face value, it looks like the personal loan is actually a good deal, since my interest rate on the total amount goes down overall, but again, I've seen some serious math whizzes in here, so maybe I'm missing something.

Other thoughts/notes:

- monthly earning total about 4800/mo after tax (2400 x2)
- monthly expenses for everything (excluding discretionary spending) comes out to 3600 when ball-parking my estimates on the high side
- I'm doing what I can now to reduce my dumb spending (I spend a fair amount of time surfing Frugal and getting ideas) in regards to regular life stuff like clothing budget, groceries, etc
- I pay extra every month towards the principal of my truck, I could shift that towards the principal of my debt

Thank you all in advance for your help and input! Yes, I know I shouldn't have gotten to where I am, in the first place, but you live and you learn, and I'm fortunate enough to be able to recover now.",finance,1656506651

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed as Wall Street tries to regain its footing](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were mixed on Wednesday morning, after the major averages made a failed attempt at a bounce in the previous session, and as the market prepares to close out the worst first half of the year since 1970.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher by 31 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures were little changed and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Investors are still searching for the bottom of a vicious market sell-off as the second quarter comes to an end Thursday. Concern over a slowing economy and aggressive rate hikes consumed much of the first half of 2022, and fears of a recession fears are rising.
*****
&gt; “We expect significant volatility this summer, with ‘face-ripping’ short-covering rallies followed by economically-inspired market slumps,” Well Fargo senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said in a note Wednesday. “While a much anticipated market ‘washout’ could catalyze a more sustained move higher, we think the market will not sustain a rally until it believes the Fed will toggle from a 50-75bp tightening to a more mundane 25bp increase.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500, which is down about 20% in 2022, is on pace for its worst first half of the year since 1970, when the index lost 21.01%. Meanwhile, on a quarterly basis, both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on track for their worst performance since 2020. The Nasdaq is headed toward its worst three-month period since 2008.
*****
&gt; In early trading Wednesday, Carnival Corp slid nearly 8% in premarket trading after Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the stock in half and said it could potentially go to zero in the face of another demand shock. The call dragged other cruise stocks lower. Royal Carribean lost 4% and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings fell 3%.
*****
&gt; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares plummeted more than 14% after the company posted a huge miss on quarterly earnings and revenue expectations and announced its CEO is stepping down.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Pinterest shares jumped more than 4% on news that CEO Ben Silbermann is stepping down.
*****
&gt; General Mills shares rose more than 2% after the company topped earnings and revenue forecasts for its most recent quarter.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the European Central Bank forum. Earnings from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, General Mills and McCormick are also on deck.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s moves followed steep losses for the major averages the day before. The Dow fell more than 1.5% on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 2% and 3%, respectively. The benchmarks all started the session with strong gains, but disappointing consumer confidence data halted those advances and sent stocks tumbling.
*****
&gt; “As long as the sell-off is orderly,” the Fed is “not concerned with the level of stock prices,” Guggenheim Partners’ Global CIO Scott Minerd told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “The bottom line is until we see some amount of panic here or something that gets the central bankers concerned, they are just ‘hellbent’ to get inflation under control.”

investing,Do Bond Total Return Index Futures/Options Exist?,"Are there futures/options products available that track a bond total returns index (coupon/interest + bond price changes) for indexes that track a basket of fixed income instruments like US Federal Treasury bills/notes/bonds, munis, corporate bonds, etc?

For example, are there futures contracts/options on total return of bonds, eg for the well-known ICE BofA US Corporate Index: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLCC0A0CMTRIV#0](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLCC0A0CMTRIV#0)

**Analogy with stock index futures**

For stock indexes like the SP500, Nasdaq, etc there are futures contracts that make it possible to take leveraged futures positions that closely correspond to the price changes + dividends that an investor would have received had they invested directly in each of the component stocks of the index, for example the ES futures contract for the SP500 index, and all of the economics of owning the component issues (eg the dividend payments) are priced right into the futures price.

**Total return bond index futures**

Is there a corresponding set of products for bonds/notes/bills total return indices? Looking for a product that allows:

1. performance that would mimic the interest/coupons plus the price changes of the underlying fixed income assets with interest/coupons and price changes built right into the futures price, like they are for stock index futures
2. low transaction costs, as is usually the case with futures
3. efficient/inexpensive leverage, as is also usually the case with futures

 HONG KONG, June 29 (Reuters) - The latest easing of coronavirus travel rules combined with other encouraging policy signals have began luring some foreign investors back to Chinese stocks, raising the chances that the market can sustain its bounce after months of heavy selling.

stocks,Powell says no guarantee of soft landing for U.S. economy...,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday said there was no guarantee that the central bank can engineer a soft landing for the U.S. economy. “We think that there are pathways for us to achieve the path back to 2% inflation while still retaining a strong labor market. We believe we can do that,” Powell said, during a panel discussion with other top heads of central banks at a European Central Bank policy conference in Sintra, Portugal. Powell quickly added that “there’s no guarantee that we can do that.”

“It’s obviously something that’s going to be quite challenging,” he added, only made more difficult by “the events of the last few months” such as the war in Ukraine. Despite the contraction of economic growth in the first three months of the year, Powell was upbeat about the current health of the economy. Households and businesses were in very strong shape and the labor market is “tremendously strong,” he said.

In fact, the Fed is engineering slower growth — “growth moderate,” as he said — a necessary adjustment to let supply catch up with strong demand.  “Is there a risk we can go too far? Certainly there is a risk,” he said. “But I wouldn’t agree that it’s the biggest risk to the economy.” The “biggest mistake” would be to fail to restore price stability,” he said.

The Fed “will not allow a transition from a low inflation environment into a high inflation environment,” Powell said. The Fed needs to get its benchmark policy rate “into restrictive territory fairly quickly,” he said.

Forex,Does interest rate accrual change the fx interbank rate? Carry trade question,"I mull the following thing over: if I enter a long position in the higher-yielding currency, say MXN or TRY, and borrow in the lower-yield currency, say, USD, then I should be collecting the difference. As settlement in most currencies is two business days and looked at only at end-of-day, then a position established just before the close on a Wed at 4pm Central time and closed down just after the re-opening at 4.15 Central time should give me two extra days, because it includes the weekend. If Mon is a holiday, it's even three days of interest accrual. So far, so good, I think I understand this.

But, doesn't that mean that because of that, the exchange rate jumps during those 15 minutes (plus a few seconds)? In anticipation of these inevitable payments, doesn't that weaken the higher-yielding currency by a few pips? The interest payments are certain, so there would be a cash outflow in the higher-yield currency, and if I can come up with that carry trade, then many others would. Wouldn't that weaken the MXN or TRY during those 15 minutes?

I have done that several years ago with the AUD and NZD when they were still high-yielding (not anymore), and I had impression that immediately at the re-open at 4.15 the higher-yielding currency dropped several pips.

As the exchange rates are heavily impacted by future expectations of the interest rates, I could imagine that interest paid in the higher-yielding must force the currency to lose value to offset these interest payments. Is there some economic theory behind that? I obviously don't want to lose in spot what I gained in interest.

investing,Why did Warren Buffet buy stocks in HP recently?,"Berkshire Hathaway  has a lot of cash. I want to know the reasoning to buy stocks at a time of rising interest rates??  


 HP dividend yield is 2.83% (according to google).

To me his actions don't make sense. 

Lets say if I have $100,000 to invest.

In the past people paid $100,000 to get 8% return (lets say in 2001), then paid $100,000 to get 5% return (lets say 2010), now recently people have been paying 100,000 to let a lousy 3% return (lets say 2020)

So if I am someone who invests for say income, for $100,000 I would have got $8,000, in 2001.

So in 2020, I would need around $270,000 to get around the same $8000.

If stock prices have been going up, because people have been chasing every lower returns e.g. 8% -&gt; 5% and now 3%    (largely because interest rates were going down)

The reason for people accepting lower returns is because interest rates kept falling, so people were okay with lower returns. 

Does that mean stock prices have fall, to entice investor to put money in those stocks?. If HP is paying 2.83%, I would want the stock price to fall, so that my return is say around 6%. 

As bank interest rates are rising, why would people put money in stock.

So for me, I would hold to cash, until returns improve?

What is Berkshire Hathaway seeing that I am not?

Sorry I have done bad job in explaining what I am trying to ask, but hopefully it will make sense to someone and may be they can re-write it or explain it in a simpler form?

vet,Cat continuing to lose weight despite clear tests; next steps,"**Age:** 12

**Sex:** Male

**Species:** Domestic shorthair cat

**Problem:** serious weight loss, diarrhea and vomiting. Cat has lost 2 lbs from August 2021 to May 2022.

**Duration:** on and off since August 2021 - dramatic weight loss since May 2022. I adopted the cat August 2021 with noted ""chronic vomiting"" in his chart from the SPCA.

**History:**

I adopted this cat as a senior. I have 0 background on him pre-August 2021 when I adopted him.

Cat has PICA and gobbles down plastic bags, tape, etc. We have to watch him like a hawk. House has been ""baby--proofed"" for him.

SPCA had the cat was Royal Canin Gastrointestinal food as of August 2021 and he was projectile vomiting every 2-3 days at and after adoption. I switched the food to Whole Hearted Grain free salmon in September 2021. Vomiting dropped to about once a week. Suspected chicken and/or grain allergy.

Blood work is beautiful as of May 14, 2022. Compared to his June 2021 blood work pre-adoption, his liver enzymes went from extremely high to perfect. No other remarkable values; blood work better than at adoption June 2021.

Vet suspected abdominal lymphoma and/or IBD. Abdominal ultrasound was all clear June 15, 2022. Nominal thickening of intestine without cancer markers. Vet did not think severe enough to be IBD, but yay cancer free!

June 23, 2022 Diarrhea PCR test had mild elevated clostridial bacteria levels. Vet started him on Tylosin June 22 or 23 for 10 days. 0 improvement in diarrhea to date.

Vet also recommended and we started Fortiflora June 28, 2022. Projectile vomiting and diarrhea continues but I realize this is way too early to see anything.

Cat has lost a further 0.7lbs since May 14 to June 29. My cat who should be 11-12lbs at a healthy weight is 8.2 lbs today and I'm $1500+ into this with 0 answers.

Next steps are steroids. 

Foods we tried since August 2021:

* Royal Canin Gastrointestial. projectile vomiting every 2-3 days
* Whole Hearted Grain Free Salmon. Diarrhea. Nominal vomiting, once a week.
* Forza10 intestinal. Did ok on this - but now refuses to eat it.
* Orijen 6 fish - did ok on this for awhile in the fall, but after a month or so - back to old tummy troubles at both ends.
* Natures Domain Salmon (and sweet potato?)
* Kitten instinct (yes, it was chicken but recommended to be easier to digest? Stays down for about 2-3 hours, then right back up).
* Raw chicken (complete diet) - 30 minutes, projectile vomit
* Raw rabbit - allergenic trial. 30 minutes, projectile vomit

I feed my other cats raw, a renal diet, etc. based on the cat's needs. None of them are the same.  Cost and complexity of food prep is a non-issue, just so long as we can get this under control.

Help. We have tried so many foods and I'm getting so frustrated. I'm cleaning vomit almost daily and I'm constantly cleaning his litter box from his ""spray paint"". You can hear his tummy gurgling. He is still bright eyed and playful, but he's basically starving to death at this point.",cryptocurrency,1656516196

He unfortunately bought a $30k car last year, when he had nothing down and only a car that he was he was already upside down on… all in all his car is worth maybe $25k-$26k today if he sells privately, and he owes $34k on the loan.

I’ve tried to talk to him about downgrading his vehicle so his payments are much lower, and so he can pay more toward the principal - he also has bad credit so the interest rate is much higher than it needs to be - 6-7%.

So I want him to get a less expensive car, but I’ve called some lenders in his area and they will only loan 120% of the car value. So I think he’d just need to chip away at it until he’s within range to get a new loan. Is this the right way to go about this? Could he sell the car privately and pay off most of the loan, and potentially find a new lender that he could roll the remaining amount into a more reasonable loan/payment? The problem is that leaves him with no car again, which was the predicament he was in in the first place with bad credit. Any help or resources for this are much appreciated.",finance,1656517613

personalfinance,Refinancing of Departed Mom's Mortgage,"Hello, bit of a weird situation I am in. My Mom passed away about a year ago, and left us her house (24M me and 26F sister). Ever since September of 2021, we (both my sister and I) have been reaching out to the mortgage company to get the lender to transfer the loan to us, and the company has been giving us the runaround. Dropping calls randomly, telling us to send in documents, and when we do, they claim they never got them (have sent the same documents 2x via mail (one of which was certified) and 3x via Fax). We offered to come in person to resolve the matter quickly and they said we cannot do that. 

To us, it seems almost intentionally like they do not want to transfer the mortgage to us. Furthermore, since my Mom refinanced the loan shortly before her death, the interest rate is 2.75%, which we would very much like to keep compared to the current rates. How do we get the mortgage company to comply? Is the CFPB the correct institution to reach out to?

For context, we have paid each mortgage payment in full since her passing and continue to plan to do so - just a bit annoying to not be able to set up direct deposit and also trying to avoid any future legal issues if the mortgage is still in her name. Lender is based in New Jersey if that is relevant. We have all necessary documentation to prove that the house is rightfully ours (including the title, which has already been transferred to our names).

I currently have 200k in cash, 135k in federal student debt on forebearance at avg 7% interest and saving at a rate of 9.5-11k a month after all expenses. No other debt. 

I am looking at this 10/1 arm and wanted to get opinions or concerns that I should be wary of. In my situation, if I were to get this particular loan, would it make most sense to put less than 20% as lender will pay the pmi and then pay off more of my student loan once forebearance ends? I assume I will be able to refinance that federal loan if that is not the route I take but I don’t think it will be less than or near 3.5% the ARM offers. 

Is an ARM something I should steer away from if possible? I’ve researched that downsides are if interest rates are higher on a fixed mortgage in 10 years from now.

personalfinance,Advice on Delaying Job Offer for Another Company Early in Interview Process,"Hi all, apologies in advance for the wall of text, but I need a little advice for delaying a job offer that just came through today (Wed 6/29) while I go through the interview process at another company. For ease, I'll call the offer that came through ""Company A"" while the other company is ""Company B"". Company A seems like a cool place to work and the pay is a nice bump from where I am at my current position, but it requires me to transition from fully remote to in-person and the location is not ideal for me (it's where I currently live, but I am desperately trying to move when my current lease is up). I would take the offer over the current job I have, but that's where Company B comes in - it would be my dream job at a company I love, and the pay would likely be the same or higher than Company A. 

The issue arises in that I am only just beginning the interview process with Company B, I have the initial phone screening interview tomorrow after I get off work. I have heard that pre-COVID this company had a 5-step interview process. I mentioned to the recruiter that I was anticipating some offers to expedite the process on their end, but I'm not sure how long the process will take or if it's been tweaked to accommodate remote workers.

So my questions are - 

1. How would you best go about delaying the first offer? I noticed their offer letter doesn't go into much detail on benefits, I could ask lots of benefits-related questions. They also know I am working at a very understaffed company at the moment so I'm not going to be replying to emails quickly (I'm going to try to stall email responses to 24 hours, and with the holiday weekend coming up, I have a little time there). They want me to start on July 18th, likely to give 2-weeks notice to my current employer. 
2. How can I speed up the interview process with Company B without seeming pushy? I plan on mentioning in my interview that I have a written offer now from another company, but I am incredibly interested in Company B. I also plan on asking about timelines and what the process is for Company B
3. How long of a delay is ""too much"" of a delay to ask for or try to get from Company A? How bad would it be if I accepted the offer from A, only to get an offer from B during my two-week notice period and renege on the initial offer?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

&amp;#x200B;

The bullwhip effect will begin winding down and losing steam by Q1 2023 as all the manufacturers begin to steady their ships and tune out the noise which will normalize inventory levels and consumer prices - milk may still be priced high, but you'll know that what you paid for it in Jan 23 will most likely be the same price you'll pay for it March 23, and the same goes for gas etc. This will have a calming effect on the markets even if the base prices are higher than they were last year.

If all of that happens somewhat in that order, it sets the stage for the next bull run beginning around Q2 '23. Many crypto people will sit on the sidelines through Q1 just to make sure it's stabilized. So from Q2 - December I see the price going up steadily from $23k - $45k and bumping around there until the next halving in '24 when the real pump begins. Alts follow follow Bitcoin, except around the halving, when whatever alts are left and are hyped will go parabolic.",cryptocurrency,1656536752

personalfinance,"Focus on debt, or start saving?","Hey everyone. Sorry I’m advance for how lengthy this is going to be

I badly want to get out of debt. Very, very badly. But at the same time, i get extreme anxiety about saving for my, my wife’s, and hopefully some day, our kids future. 

We are both 25. Together, we bring home about $4252 a month. We live in an expensive area(Illinois) which we really want to change in the future, because our rent is $1610 a month. (We had to take this place because we had to move out immediately of our old place, and this was all that was around that had immediate opening)

After rent, we have about $1100 a month in bills from when we were younger and stupid with money. We are both on the same page now, but just 2-4 years ago we were RECKLESS with money. Credit cards just seemed like unlimited money to us back then, and car loans on top of that, etc.. you get it. We made a lot of mistakes, and we can both acknowledge that now. 

So, after bills, rent, food, gas, life, we have about $1500-$1000 left over in a month. In total(before student loans) we’re about $30,000-$40,000 in debt. Not exactly going homeless debt, but definitely not a comfortable amount of debt by any means. 

I just graduated yesterday with my degree in cyber security, and my wife is graduating soon with a degree in psychology. So, I don’t exactly doubt either of us will have trouble getting decent jobs in the future, but I just don’t know what to do or where to start really. 

I may actually be going into the Navy in a couple months to gain the real world experience I need for a lot of cyber security jobs, and obviously the military comes with a lot of financial benefits. All your interest rates being lowered to 6%, VA loan, insurance, 401k options, the whole retirement option, etc. 

The only downside is, I(we) would be taking a HUGE pay cut. Almost $20,000 a year pay cut. But, at the same time, it kind of wouldn’t make a difference considering that’s about what I pay a year in rent alone right now, and with the military you get free housing. So in a way, it’s wouldn’t make much a difference at all

Anyway, based off these numbers, what does everyone suggest? Any advice? Pay off what I can and worry about my future later, or start to save what I can now, and pay the minimum on everything until I’m in the position where I can pay everything off easier?

Also, how screwed are we? Did we kind of fuck up already, or is there time for us to correct our course?",finance,1656544111

personalfinance,Buying house for father in law,"My father in law is located in another state (5 hours away). He has lived there with a sibling for the last 30+ years. His sibling owns the house and they have no lease or other kind of contract. He pays very little rent (I think around 300/month). Recently, his sibling’s health has declined and is now in a care facility. Another sibling was put in charge of the finances. They need to sell the house to pay for the care facility. My father in law has very little income (he’s on disability) and can’t really afford rent somewhere else. He can also be pretty difficult around other people. Just renting a room from someone won’t work. He has done a lot for us in the past and we want to help him out. Our plan is to buy his sibling’s house. He would continue to pay us the low rent he is used to, plus utilities etc. The alternative would be for him to move in with us (not a good idea), or us supplementing his rent somewhere else (seems like thrown away money). Our plan is to pay for the house with some of our savings (skip/delay the pole barn and/or pool we had planned to build at our residence) and a mortgage (probably about 80k cash and 160k mortgage). We’d probably do a 30 year mortgage for the security of a lower payment but pay some extra if we can (at the cost of a higher interest rate). Of course, interest rates suck right now but we’d shift some of the extra payments we currently make on our 2.25% mortgage over to the higher interest mortgage and hopefully pay it off in the next 10 years and/or refinance when rates are better. He’s 71 so we are likely looking at 5-15 years for him in that house, depending on how his own health holds up. Eventually we would sell the house to pay for his care (if that becomes necessary), or to fund other investments or our kid’s college expenses if the timing lines up. We likely wouldn’t want to keep it as a rental once he is gone because the property is not geographically close to us. I think we can handle the extra monthly costs of mortgage, insurance, taxes, etc. without too much impact to our lifestyle. We don’t view this purely as an investment and are willing to spend some money to keep my father in law in the house he’s lived in for so long, but we still want to make sure we keep the risk minimal and maintain financial flexibility as much as possible and, of course, we want to do this the smartest way possible.

The following questions came to mind: What is the best way to own that property from a tax and investment strategy perspective? Obviously we won’t have much income from it since he won’t pay much rent but we will have expenses for mortgage, insurance, property taxes, maintenance, etc. Should the house be owned by my wife and myself jointly or just by her or just by me (our residence is owned by me)? Would that make a difference either now or when we sell? Or should the house be owned by an LLC or other entity set up for that purpose (trust)? Is there a way to leverage the expenses associated with this property to offset our other income (we don’t really have other investment income at this time if that matters - most of our income is from my W2 job and her 1099’s). Should we treat this as a rental property or just as a secondary residence that my father in law happens to live in? Is there any (tax?) benefit of a larger mortgage and using less cash? Anything in particular to watch out for?

personalfinance,Rent or sell my primary residence?,"I currently own my 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom home in Kansas City, MO. Original purchase price in July 2018 was $196,500 with a 4.875% 30 year conventional loan. I refinanced two years ago and locked in a 30 year conventional loan at 2.875%. The monthly payment including escrow is $1,180/month. I currently owe $184,200 and the Zestimate claims my home is now worth $284,700, but I’m convinced I can get $300K. The home was built in 1997 and is in pretty good shape (I just replaced the furnace and AC unit last month).

My family is considering moving to Tulsa OK in the next year to be closer to family. I feel like most wealthy people I know own “things” and I’m trying to decide if I should just sell the house and be happy with the ~$100K in equity or if I should rent my current home since I have a stellar interest rate. I think I could rent out the home for a minimum of $1,800 but could possibly get something closer to $2K+.

I don’t have much saved up in liquid savings at the moment but I think I could get $10-15K in a savings account by next spring.

The type of house we would want in Tulsa will probably be closer to $400K and my lender stated I would need 5% down ($20Kish). I could get that money in numerous ways like some coming from savings, a home equity loan, or possibly a family loan.

solar,Buy vs. lease for new construction,"Currently evaluating whether to purchase or lease solar on new construction (have to pick one or the other). Builder is using Sunpower exclusively (I cannot amend this). 

Quick facts:

## Buying 
- Buying from Sunpower adds to the mortgage 
- Estimated 26% federal tax credit is around $4500
- Requires 20% down payment ($3000)
- Buying monthly cost added to an estimated 30-yr mortgage is $95
- Unclear if monitoring is additional cost 

## Leasing
- Leasing requires no down payment
- Lease monthly cost is $100 (includes an auto-payment discount of $7)
- Lease term is 25 years
- No escalation (“escalating 0.0% annually”)

My initial reaction is that it’s more expensive to buy in the long run when factoring in a 30-yr mortgage term. However I also know leasing generally benefits the leaser and not the lessee, but I’m having a hard time seeing the downside to leasing in this situation.

I am seriously considering installing solar panel system on our house after local electric company announced a 17.1% price increase starting in July. 

I am looking a a local well reputable solar panel company and it is a purchase agreement not a lease. 

The solar company guarantees a minimum of 98% or more reduction in our current monthly electric bill with a 25kw system and the finance payment would be ~$300 compared to our current average electric bill or $450 per month. 

Initial quoted price for system is $105,000

My question is has anyone successfully negotiated a lower price than what was first pitched to them?  I am wanting to ask this company to see if they can do any better on the price or explore other local solar company options and get competitive bids. 

I really like this first company I spoke with and want to do business with them but also want to see if I can get a lower price. I feel like all
Solar companies know about the federal tax credit and inflate their prices accordingly. Maybe I’m wrong.

investing,Larry Summers Nailed Inflation. But Is He Right on What Comes Next?,"Once inflation is brought under control, the former Treasury secretary sees a return to slow-growth secular stagnation

https://www.wsj.com/articles/larry-summers-nailed-inflation-but-is-he-right-on-what-comes-next-11656343688

In February 2021, Larry Summers was right and I was wrong. The former Treasury secretary warned that President Biden’s stimulus package was far too large and would lead to far too high inflation. I was less worried and thought the Federal Reserve would be willing to raise interest rates to head off any inflationary problem. My faith was misplaced, and it took me until June to realize my mistake. The Fed waited another nine months to act.

Markets are finally focused on whether the Fed’s newfound hawkishness will start a recession—Prof. Summers thinks it will. There is a longer-term question that matters, too: Once inflation is finally brought under control, do we return to the post-2009 secular stagnation, or will there be a new paradigm? Here again I find myself disagreeing with Prof. Summers, who thinks the likelihood is we return to the status quo ante.

The question is far from academic for anyone thinking about how to position their portfolio in future years. A return to the miserable growth and excess savings of the decade before the pandemic sets up the same trade that prospered for years: long everything that benefits from the Fed going back to loose money. That would mean buying expensive technology stocks, bonds and private assets and ignoring cheap, economically sensitive cyclical stocks.

Prof. Summers set out the case over a late-afternoon dish of cured salmon at a London hotel.

“It’s 60-40 that we’re going back to something that’s kind of secular stagnation,” he said. Just as in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 recession, interest rates will be held down by increased savings resulting from an aging population and the uncertainty that comes after a crisis. Rapid technological development will again keep the cost of capital goods down. More savings and less investment means lower after-inflation interest rates are required to balance the economy.

He sees the threat of recession, even with 10-year bond yields at just over 3%, as strong evidence that he is right that the U.S. and the world can’t cope with higher rates.

“The fact that such low rates seem to be causing a recession is quite prohibitive,” he argues.

Bitcoin,The nature of the fiat debt slavery cartel is little understood by the general public because secrecy and opaqueness and control of the narrative are key features in its operational model. This post is slightly adapted and developed from one posted on r/BitcoinNewZealand.,"Most people do not understand how the base layer of the economy, the monetary system, actually operates. Upon this basis of ignorance a lot of questionable strategies are built.

So how does the fiat monetary system operate?

Fiat money is a state imposed monopoly, but in practice the vast bulk of fiat money is issued as debt. When a private bank issues a new loan or mortgage it creates new fiat money as a balance in the recipients bank account. This money is created out of thin air and yet the bank charges interest upon it until the debt is paid off. Nice business for the bankers.

The effect of this constant issuance of debt increasing the monetary supply is the value of all existing money constantly declining driving people to consume more and incentivising people to take on debt to buy hard assets which will appreciate. This has been the self reinforcing paradigm of the fiat monetary system for several decades but which is now reaching a crisis point.

The cost of debt is now being increased upon a huge recent increase in debt extended during the recent very very low interest rates. Central banks will raise the price of debt to try to control inflation but raising it too much risks leading to default on debts and the entire edifice of fiat money collapsing.

The fiat debt based monetary system has rewarded debt leveraged speculation but has undermined the economy by undermining the very fundamental principles of capitalism. Capitalism assumes the accumulation of capital (in the form of cash savings) via deferred gratification- those who save money are then empowered to invest that money as they choose. However the fiat debt system of monetary issuance grants a much easier method of capital issuance to the private banks who are licensed to create new fiat money out of thin air. This is how fiat money has undermined your property rights and capitalism itself for many decades.

Is there an alternative? Yes, now there is!

Bitcoin is a working model alternative to the fiat debt monetary system.

Bitcoin restores the inherent ability to save capital without it being constantly and relentlessly debased by rentseeking bankers.

Note- a higher ratio of NZs GDP is extracted by foreign bankers than any other OECD nation.

The big 4 'Aussie' banks in New Zealand are in fact all majority owned by US domiciled shareholders. In addition to this a large proportion of their profits are extracted tax free via the intermediary funders who provide the USD capital backing which is charged as a tax deductible expense and remitted to the funding intermediaries free of tax. Shareholders in these banks do not see any of the millions remitted to the intermediary capital funders. Both tax and shareholders are bypassed...

The structure of the fiat debt slavery banking cartel matches almost precisely the military structures and hierarchy that support its global imposition.

NZs annual tribute of several billion dollars to the US via Australian proxy banks is paralleled by the subservience of the EU, Japan and Britain to US monetary and military hegemony.",cryptocurrency,1656565342

31. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss.

42. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
43. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

45. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/03/heres-whats-in-new-yorks-new-bitcoin-mining-ban-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/03/heres-whats-in-new-yorks-new-bitcoin-mining-ban-.html) [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/04/new-york-crypto-mining-bill-senator-anna-kelles-interview.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/04/new-york-crypto-mining-bill-senator-anna-kelles-interview.html)
46. Reports are also coming in that the Biden Administration crypto plans due in August will target Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains over their “sky high” energy consumption.

56. Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill. Fortunately, it is actually the courts who get to interpret law (when it’s actually passed) in the US and not anonymous people on press calls.

CryptoCurrency,Nic Carter on (toxic) bitcoin maximalism...,"Nic Carter pulling no punches in response to a pile on by bitcoin maxi’s after a tweet announcing an investment in Dynamic (not on bitcoin…)

&gt;I’m not owed any deference, or anything at all, because of my prior work on Bitcoin. What I do think it does, unquestionably, is establish my pro-bitcoin credentials. If you think I’m a bitcoin grifter tediously building up a reputation in Bitcoin land over five years through countless articles, appearances, podcasts, and tens of millions of capital deployed, all to suddenly turn on Bitcoin — that’s the most long term and expensive grift of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“It’s clear that there’s an awful sickness pervading the Bitcoin space. Most Bitcoiners are normal, good people. For the vast majority of them, there’s no lifestyle associated with owning Bitcoin, as it should be. But there’s a subset of people — a small, flailing, shrinking group — who are mostly new to Bitcoin, made Bitcoin their entire personality, and became completely emotionally invested in it. They are spoonfed on a diet of the same half dozen thinkers, and suffer from an ideological monoculture. They cannot extricate themselves from their lifestyle/investment, and so when anyone in the tribe or adjacent says anything that remotely contradicts their established dogma (which is inconsistent, morally confused, and indefensible anyway), they go on the attack.”

personalfinance,Taking out a loan during high inflation?,"I would like to buy a motorcycle. About £6k in value. I do have some savings in an ISA that I could use to buy it outright, but I would prefer to spread the cost if possible. My bank can give me a loan of 5.5% interest over 4 years at a nice, affordable monthly rate.

My question is, am I actually better to take the loan since the interest rate is lower than the inflation rate? Also, if inflation at stays high, the value of bike on the used market should technically rise, therefore if I ever needed to sell it, I would be less likely to be in a lot negative equity (it's a bike which tends to hold value)

Or am I better biting the bullet and using the cash that I have that's only gaining 1.25% in my ISA?

CryptoCurrency,Crypto’s Tumultuous Second Quarter Leaves Investors Asking: What Else Could Go Wrong? [WSJ],"From Paul Vigna, with WSJ

[square bracket annotations my own]


Cryp­to’s rocket ship [🚀] to the moon crash-landed back on Earth in the sec­ond quar­ter.

In al­most every way, the sec­ond quarter was the po­lar op­po­site of the gilded, nearly two-year rally that preceded it. Two re­lated cryp­tocur­ren­cies, Ter­ra­USD and Luna, plunged in early May, and the ef­fects quickly rip­pled. Prices for bit­coin and other cryp­tocurren­cies tum­bled. Lenders told customers they couldn’t take their money out. [Also known as Kwontitative Tightening]

“We’ve been par­ty­ing hard for a very long time,” said Mati Greenspan, the founder and chief      ex­ecu­tive of research and money man­age­ment firm Quan­tum Eco­nomics. “Now we’re waking up with a mas­sive headache.”

Across 2020 and 2021, the crypto sector’s 
mar­ket value cat­a­pulted from about $200 bil­lion to a peak of $3 trillion last No­vember, ac­cord­ing to Coin­Mar­ket­Cap. Prices tum­bled at the end of 2021, flat­lined in the first quar­ter of 2022, then fell again. In the sec­ond quar­ter, cryp­to’s mar­ket value dropped 56% from about $2.04 tril­lion to about $890 bil­lion.

Big losses are noth­ing new for cryptocurren­cies, but in prior crashes, the mar­ket was much smaller and comprised mainly risk tol­er­ant technophiles, lib­er­tar­i­ans and niche play­ers. In the past cou­ple of years, the crypto mar­ket has bur­rowed into the main­stream with Su­per Bowl ads and Sat­ur­day Night Live par­o­dies, 
at­tracting both Wall Street traders and in­di­vid­ual in­vestors. An ecosys­tem of ex­changes, 
bro­ker­ages and lenders has sprung up around it. The chaos un­der­scores what a risky in­vest­ment crypto can be, and some reg­u­la­tors and 
law­mak­ers are call­ing for stricter rules.

The cur­rent mael­strom started in early May with the col­lapse of a blockchain-based plat­form called Terra, whose main fea­ture was a sta­ble­coin called Ter­ra­USD and a sis­ter to­ken called Luna. Sta­ble­coins are de­signed to main­tain a peg to 
na­tional cur­ren­cies, and they drew in many 
peo­ple who thought they were a safe bet. Many put their Ter­ra­USD coins in a sort of crypto bank called An­chor Pro­to­col, which of­fered an eye-pop­ping 19.5% in­ter­est rate on de­posits.

That high rate at­tracted in­vestors, who put in a com­bined $60 bil­lion on Terra, but crit­ics and even some in­vestors warned it wasn’t 
sus­tain­able. Over the course of a few days in May, the sta­ble­coin lost its peg, and both 
cur­ren­cies quickly plunged to nearly zero. All the as­sets on the plat­form be­came vir­tu­ally worth­less.

The credit crunch en­snared a num­ber of other firms. One large lender, Cel­sius Net­work LLC, told cus­tomers in June that it was freez­ing ac­counts, pre­vent­ing peo­ple from tak­ing their money out. Sev­eral other lenders fol­lowed suit. (Cel­sius says it is try­ing to sta­bi­lize its liq­uid­ity and op­er­a­tions.)

The big U.S. ex­change Coin­base Global Inc. abruptly cut 18% of its staff, even re­scind­ing em­ploy­ment of­fers it had made to peo­ple who hadn’t yet started [Notably, in a very classy move CB is now looking for new employees in Europe, seems like a great spot to work]. Other ex­changes, such as Gem­ini Trust Co. and Cryp­to.­com, have also laid off staffers, as well as lenders like BlockFi.

A hedge fund, Three Ar­rows Cap­i­tal Ltd., suf­fered heavy losses in Ter­ra’s col­lapse and in other crypto in­vest­ments, and this week a court 
or­dered it to liq­ui­date. The bro­ker Voy­ager Digi­tal Ltd., which had lent money to Three Ar­rows, had to bor­row from the crypto ex­change FTX and 
lim­ited cus­tomer with­drawals to $10,000.

“It’s go­ing to be a hard pe­riod for 
peo­ple to get through,” said Adam Reeds, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of crypto lender Ledn. “There will be some ef­fect on morale.”

Ven­ture money is tight­en­ing as well. In the second quar­ter, there were 511 deals in the crypto/blockchain in­dus­try that raised about $7.9 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to data from Pitch­Book. In the first quar­ter, there were 686 deals that raised about $10 bil­lion.

On June 18, a Sat­ur­day, bit­coin traded as low as $17,601.58 af­ter a bru­tal week for stocks. The Fed­eral Re­serve had lifted rates by 0.75 
per­centage point that week, the big­gest in­crease since 1994, rais­ing con­cerns that the U.S. could tip into re­ces­sion. On Wednes­day, bit­coin traded around $20,200, down some 70% from its record of nearly $68,000 in No­vember.

Many peo­ple in crypto ex­pect a long slog back. There will be con­tin­ued consol­i­da­tion among the sur­viv­ing com­pa­nies and projects and a fo­cus on more con­ser­v­a­tive, grounded prod­ucts that are al­ready prof­itable, said Sid­ney Pow­ell, co-founder of crypto lend­ing firm Maple Fi­nance.

economy,Financial resources for a rookie?,"Some days ago I asked in this subreddit about some resources on financial markets for a rookie. I want to educate myself on basic practical stuff but I guess I couldn't properly articulate exactly what I wanted (English is not my native language, maybe that plays a role) . I've read a few books on Economics and business but I want to delve deeper into the matter with not only fictional stories and fables to explain a concept but real world examples and as a I said - practical stuff. In the previous months I've read Economics for dummies, The Armchair Economist, Rich dad poor dad, The Millionaire Fastlane, The Psychology of money, The Barefoot Investor and The Undercover Economist and although I understand the basics I don't fill confident for example to assess if it is a good time to buy real estate or bonds for example. I've provided a quote from MJ DeMarco this time to better explain the type of content I am looking for:

*Many perfectly intelligent people lack rudimentary knowledge of basic financial concepts such as: Interest rates Taxable and non-taxable yields, Amortization of mortgages, The balancing of a check book, Basic percentage calculations, Calculating return on investment, Why stocks rise and fall, Why a guaranteed 15% return on a bank CD is screaming, “scam!”, How stock options work, such as calls and puts, Why insurance exists, How a mutual fund works, What bonds are and how they rise and fall, Global currency; To successfully leverage a money system for passivity, you have to familiarize yourself with financial instruments that fuel the money system. Do you know how to calculate simple interest? Return on investment? Do you know what happens to the price of a bond when interest rates go up? Can you figure out the difference between a tax-free yield and a taxable yield? These concepts harden your road to wealth. Financial illiterates can't manage money systems. To succeed on your roadtrip, you have to know the rules of the road and pass wealth “driver's education”-basic finance and economics.*

I am currently first year at University so I am ready to invest a lot of time if someone recommends some kind of a book sequence, courses, textbooks... I want to prepare myself for the real world and not learn it all the hard way. I would be quite thankful if someone drops some resources and may the odds be ever in your favor!",finance,1656586218

Bitcoin,Last chance to be considered an early adopter?,"Do you think this dip is the last chance to be considered an early adopter?

Personally, I think this is it.

And after the next halving, it will be an explosion towards widespread adoption as conservatives globally start racing each other to accumulate as much as possible.

But truthfully, who knows! I could be very wrong.

I'll leave you with these thoughts:With FIAT, you have people who suck up all the cash and spend little of it, rather keeping it within friend circles in power. They lend it out to people who are vulnerable and gain interest whilst also having the option to print more FIAT so that your savings is worth less whilst they can lend you more money at interest rates that keep them filthy rich.But worst of all, you can lose your savings when your banks make malinvestments and then still get bailed out by more money prints.With Bitcoin you have people who suck it up, making them incredibly rich.You can be a poor person saving it very slowly; maybe you won't ever be able to buy a house.You can be a rich person, that moves to bitcoin and become even more rich.But you can't print more.

That simple fact means that if 1 billion people want to use bitcoin equally, they would only be able to have 0.021 BTC each, and it would never change.

Hypothetically, if just 1 billion people start getting paid salaries in BTC, that would mean that it would need to be much less than 0.021 BTC (and that's ignoring all the things such as completely lost BTC or the fact that some people will still not be selling their large amounts). Of course I don't think BTC will be used for salaries, but it's just to give you an idea of the scale needed for BTC to go cosmic.

And finally people always say ""BTC can't go above $1million because that would mean the MCAP would be $21 trillion."" but is it really a market? I would argue that due to its decentralisation, it's not. No single entity or country owns the network or controls it. And of course 1 btc = 1 btc. 

To me, it's transactional power globally. It's the general potential transactional purchasing power of the network. Over $5 trillion worth of currency is traded every day and maybe we should stop looking at MCAP and start looking at the daily total value of transactions, because why does MCAP even matter when we are dealing with a truly decentralized method of transaction?",cryptocurrency,1656587642

personalfinance,Does my account setup and portfolio make sense?,"Hi All,

This is my first post here but I've been following the community for a while, and there's so many knowledgeable people that I was hoping you all could weigh in on my current portfolio and future strategy. I'll get right to it.

**Goal**

Financial Independence (and not so much REtirement at the moment). Honestly, like many of you, I want to feel fulfilled and have a sense of purpose--but on my terms--so the ability to have the financial freedom to choose the type of work I do is what matters to me.

**Context**

Since my early 20s (15-18 years ago), I've always saved at least the company match in my 401k and contributed $100/month to my Roth IRA. It hasn't been much, but at least I was developing some good habits. However, for a while in my 20s and 30s, I was underpaid and didn't make enough money to comfortably contribute much more than what I stated. Fast forward to last year where I switched jobs and started earning a fair amount more money + started to learn and focus more on personal finance. I read and listened to numerous sources on the subject (Dave Ramsey, The Money Guy show, Reddit, etc.). I formulated my opinions based on my situation and took action.

I tried to play catch up in all of my accounts last year (e.g., maxed my 401k, HSA, and Roth IRA for the first time ever). I left my financial advisor (and the 1% fee), structured my accounts and investments in a way that I believed made sense for me and my future growth/goals (e.g., rolling my Trad IRA balance into my 401k plan in case I need to do a backdoor IRA, investing in target date index funds that align with when I can take penalty-free withdrawals/my risk tolerance, etc.). I've gone through the Prime Directive flowchart and believe I'm at the bottom where it's about socking away more money for early retirement or saving for immediate goals. I think I'm doing all of the right things but I don't know what I don't know, so I'm looking to all of you like-minded and intelligent people to see if there's anything you would change.

**Here are the numbers.**

Age: 38

Income: $125k

Expenses: $3,300/month (inclusive of 15 year mortgage @ 2.5%, $118k remaining). I charge just about everything else to the credit card and pay it off.

No debt except mortgage.

**Accounts**

Trad 401k (FSKAX, FSPSX, FXNAX): $200k

Trad IRA: $0

Roth IRA (Target Date Index Fund 2035 FIHFX): $19k

HSA (Target Date Index Fund 2050 FIPFX): $5,500

Brokerage (VTI): $3,000

Cash Management (Emergency Fund): $20k

529s (Moderate Age-Based Option): $7,300

Bank Accounts: Checking + Savings = $4k

Total: \~$259k

**This year and each year going forward, I plan to do the following:**

Max Trad 401k. $20.5k

Max HSA. $3,650

Max Roth IRA. $6,000

Max Dependent Care FSA. $5,000

Buy $5,000 in ESPP stock.

Contribute $500 to each of my kids' (ages 2 and 4) 529s.

Total: $41,150

Anything left over will allocated based on the question of, ""Is there anything immediate I want to save for (vacation, something material, etc.)?"":

1. If yes, put the extra money in my savings account until I can buy the thing I want.
2. If not, invest the extra money in VTI (through my brokerage account).

A few more of my thoughts/comments:

\- While I originally wanted $0 debt when I started taking personal finance more seriously, with my mortgage interest rate being only 2.5%, I'm thinking that's an OK debt to have, and a good compromise is to have it paid off around the time that I turn 50.

\- You may have picked up on the fact that I'm maxing out my HSA at $3,650 and not $7,300. That's because I'm married and my wife is contributing the other half to her HSA. I only described my situation and setup for simplicity, but we intend to model her setup after mine (once it's vetted). Her salary is about $75k. She contributes to her Trad. 401k up to the employer match and maxes out her HSA. I'm considering taking any disposable income that I have and helping max out her Roth IRA and Trad. 401k (before investing in VTI). I know the 401k wouldn't be direct--she would increase the percentage she contributes and I would just give her the money to make up for it.

So how does everything look? Would you change anything about my setup/investments today? What about my strategy going forward?

Please be brutally honest--I want to optimize this as best I can without obsessing over it.

Thanks!",finance,1656589615

stocks,(6/30) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of June and Q2! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, June the 30th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures fall more than 1% as S&amp;P 500 tracks for worst first half of the year since 1970](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures declined early on Thursday morning, as the S&amp;P 500 prepares to wrap its worst first half in decades.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 363 points, or 1.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 1.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures pulled back by 1.9%.
*****
&gt; Those losses came after home furnishings company RH issued a profit warning for the full year, Sweden’s central bank became the latest to hike rates. RH shares slipped more than 5% in the premarket.
*****
&gt; “The combination of slowing growth, fading EPS prospects, and ongoing monetary tightening has been weighing on equity sentiment for months and is causing consternation again this morning,” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; Investors are also looking ahead to the release of new inflation data, with the core personal consumption expenditures index set to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET. That’s the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, and it’s expected to show a year-over-year increase of 4.8% for May, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was coming off a mixed session, with the Dow advancing 0.27% for its first positive day in three. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both posted a third straight negative day, declining 0.07% and 0.03%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on track for their worst three-month period since the first quarter of 2020 when Covid lockdowns sent stocks tumbling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down more than 20% over the last three months, its worst stretch since 2008.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is also on track for its worst first half of the year since 1970, as myriad factors pressure markets.
*****
&gt; “Surging inflation, the pivot in Fed policy, and historically pricey equity valuations were on the minds of investors as the year began,” noted John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; ″[T]he combination of COVID-19 lockdowns in China and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has escalated volatility further with investors becoming increasingly concerned about the possibility of [a] global recession sometime within the next year,” he added.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve has taken aggressive action to try and bring down rampant inflation, which has surged to a 40-year high.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester told CNBC that she supports a 75 basis point hike at the central bank’s upcoming July meeting if current economic conditions persist. Earlier in June, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, which was the largest increase since 1994.
*****
&gt; Some Wall Street watchers are worried that too-aggressive action will tip the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; “We do not believe the stock market has bottomed yet and we see further downside ahead. Investors should be holding elevated levels of cash right now,” said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.
*****
&gt; “We see the S&amp;P 500 bottoming at around 3,100, as the Federal Reserve’s aggressive, but necessary inflation-fighting measures are likely to depress corporate earnings and push stocks lower,” he added.
*****
&gt; All three major averages are on track to end June with losses. The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a third straight month of declines. The tech-heavy index has been hit especially hard as investors rotate out of growth-oriented areas of the market. Rising rates makes future profits — like those promised by growth companies — less attractive.
*****
&gt; The index is more than 30% below its Nov. 22 all-time high. Some of the largest technology companies have registered sizeable declines this year, with Netflix down 70%. Apple and Alphabet have each lost roughly 22%, while Facebook-parent Meta has slid 51%.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, weekly jobless claims will be in focus Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting 230,000 first-time filers. Personal income and spending data will also be released.
*****
&gt; On the earnings front Constellation Brands and Walgreens Boots Alliance will post quarterly updates before the opening bell, while Micron is on deck for after the market closes.

 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Stocks sank on Thursday to extend what is the worst first half of a year for global share prices on record, as investors fret that the latest show of central bank determination to tame inflation will slow economies rapidly. Central bank chiefs from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England met in Portugal this week and voiced their renewed commitment to control inflation no matter what pain it caused.",finance,1656594187

CryptoCurrency,Thoughts on DARPA's findings?,"[https://www.techrepublic.com/article/pentagon-finds-concerning-vulnerabilities-on-blockchain/](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/pentagon-finds-concerning-vulnerabilities-on-blockchain/)

A report commissioned by the Pentagon concluded that the blockchain is not decentralized, is vulnerable to attacks and is running outdated software. The report, “[Are Blockchains Decentralized, Unintended Centralities in Distributed Ledgers](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd11235b3950c2c1a3b6df4/62af6c641a672b3329b9a480_Unintended_Centralities_in_Distributed_Ledgers.pdf)”, uncovered that a subset of participants can “exert excessive and centralized control over the entire blockchain system.”

The findings of the report are a cause of concern for a wide range of sectors, but especially serious for security, fintech, big tech and the crypto industries, which continue to grow.

The Pentagon’s research arm, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), engaged Trail of Bits—a security research organization—to investigate the blockchain. Trail of Bits focused on [Bitcoin](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/bitcoin-cheat-sheet-everything-professionals-need-to-know/) and Ethereum, the two leading [cryptocurrencies](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/crypto-wallets/) in the global market.

Trail of Bits says that it only takes four entities to disrupt Bitcoin and only two to disrupt Ethereum. Additionally, 60% of all Bitcoin traffic moves through just three ISPs. Outdated and unencrypted software and [blockchain](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/blockchain-cheat-sheet/) protocols were also identified by the organization.

## Cryptocurrencies and the new era of digital finance

The Pentagon’s report surfaced just weeks after the [Luna crypto crash](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/30/terra-2point0-new-luna-cryptocurrency-is-already-crashing.html). In May 2022, the decentralized stable coin TerraUSD—pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar—dropped to 30 cents when an algorithm running on the blockchain collapsed. Financial experts warn that the Luna crash was an important lesson about the risks of the blockchain.

Since the Luna crash, cryptocurrencies have been in full meltdown with billions of dollars being lost and investors cashing out their crypto assets. Cryptocurrencies continue to be affected by the global economy, supply chain problems, federal interest hikes, inflation and a looming recession. The DARPA commissioned report only adds more concerns about the blockchain and affects investors’ perception and confidence.

Furthermore, the crypto world and blockchain operations are now deeply entangled in many industries that have penciled out plans to use cryptocurrencies due to their agility, immediacy, product potential and capacity to provide easier access to financial services to the global population. Security remains a top priority, challenge and concern in this new digital financial era.

## The blockchain security challenges

“The safety of a blockchain depends on the security of the software and protocols of its off-chain governance or consensus mechanisms,” the Trail of Bits report says. Trail of Bits researchers registered multiple accounts with mining pool sites to study its code when available. Their discoveries are shocking.

According to Trail of Bits, ViaBTC, a leading global mining pool, assigns the password “123” to its accounts. Pooling, another mining organization, does not even validate credentials at all, and Slushpool—which has mined more than 1.2 million Bitcoin since 2010—instructs users to ignore the password field. Combined, these three mining pools account for about 25% of the Bitcoin hash rate, or total computer power.

Trail of Bits warns that nodes used by crypto miners can be easily deployed using an inexpensive cloud server. These can be used to flood the network in what is known as a Sybil attack. Sybil attacks can execute an eclipse attack, where a malicious actor seeks to isolate users by denying access to the nodes.

Trail of Bits presented evidence that a dense subnetwork of public nodes is largely responsible for reaching consensus and communicating with miners. An example of a Sybil attack was linked to a malicious actor believed to be from Russia. The attacker gained control of up to 40% of Tor exit nodes and used them to rewrite Bitcoin traffic.

Additionally, software errors and bugs are also a main security concern in the blockchain. Ideally, all nodes should operate under the same latest version of the software but that is not the case. Software bugs have already caused blockchain errors in Ethereum and 21% of Bitcoin nodes are running an older version of the Bitcoin Core client, known to be vulnerable, Trail of Bits says.

Blockchain software developers and maintainers, and millions of crypto users around the world are also being targeted in attacks, along with mainstream technology sites that are beginning to use the blockchain as a new source of income.

## Big Tech and the Web3 marketing revolution

The new DARPA report finds big tech in a critical moment, with many top companies already heavily investing in blockchain technology. For decades, big tech’s main source of revenue has been online advertising. However, the global trend driven by users’ privacy concerns, is bringing the third-party era to an end, significantly affecting online advertising revenues.

All big tech companies—Meta Platforms, Spotify, Paypal, Twitter, Google, Apple, Alibaba, Microsoft and others—are pivoting to Web3 and blockchain in search of new sources of income.

Microsoft for example, in 2016, developed [Project Bletchley](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/bletchley-blockchain/), a blockchain as a service (BaaS) project. Since then the company has continued to explore crypto opportunities. In 2021, Microsoft was also awarded a [U.S. patent](https://uspto.report/patent/grant/11,102,003?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_BZ4hDZeJnQ3Gi5CCgmUtpvKpLSdy5Xi722KIutq4.OM-1629963637-0-gqNtZGzNApCjcnBszQb9) for blockchain software that would create crypto tokens. On May 31, 2022, [Microsoft](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/may-2022/cryptocurrency-exchanges-now-allowed-in-the-us-with-pre-approval) announced it will be allowing advertising for cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S., limited to the Microsoft Advertising Search Network.

While Microsoft focuses on technical solutions, other companies like Meta Platforms or Twitter, direct their investments into mainstream use of blockchain. On November 10, 2021, Twitter formally launched Twitter Crypto—a specialized crypto team—to build its blockchain and Web3 services. [Crypto expert Tess Rinearson](https://twitter.com/_tessr/status/1458466734327963648), working with cryptocurrency since 2015, was called to lead the team. Twitter has been exploring and developing crypto payments, crypto tips, creator monetization, NFTs and decentralizing social media.

In similar ways, other big tech companies are looking into the future of the blockchain.In November 2021, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook said during the NYT Dealbook Conference that the company is looking into cryptocurrencies. While Cook did not reveal exactly what Apple is working on, he hinted to [NFTs](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/nfts-cheat-sheet-everything-you-need-to-know-about-non-fungible-tokens/) and accepting crypto on [Apple Pay](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/apple-pay-the-smart-persons-guide/).

The new Trail of Bits report warns big tech, as they develop their future. “The report demonstrates the continued need for careful review when assessing new technologies, such as blockchains, as they proliferate in our society and economy,” said Joshua Baron, DARPA program manager overseeing the study.

Cryptocurrencies saw massive adoption during the pandemic years, which drove a global digital transformation and acceleration. In 2021, Bitcoin achieved, after 12 years, a milestone that took companies like Amazon, Apple or Microsoft from 21 to 44 years to achieve: A $1 trillion market valuation. As the popularity of cryptos rose, governments and banks stepped up to keep ahead of the curve, often testing the waters to regulate the sector, unsuccessfully.

One of the biggest challenges of the blockchain is its global expanding dimensions and rich diversity. The [“Global Cryptocurrency Market”](https://skyquestt.com/report/cryptocurrency-market) report of [Skyquest](https://skyquestt.com/report/cryptocurrency-market), valued the crypto market at $1.85 billion in 2021 and expects it to reach $32.5 billion by 2028. Not only are millions of users turning to cryptos but thousands of new and old companies are now working on the blockchain.

[Roland Berger](https://www.rolandberger.com/en/Insights/Publications/The-rise-of-the-Crypto-Economy.html) says there are about 12,000 crypto projects and companies operating by January 2022. The number of Crypto Unicorn companies—valued at over $1 billion—increased by an incredible 491% in 2021.

A vulnerable blockchain environment—as described by the Trail of Bits report—puts these companies, their investments, years of work and hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.

These companies are developing finance services, asset tokenization, the metaverse, NFTs, supply chain management solutions, capital markets and insurance products, and crypto mining and staking, among others. They are poised to disrupt and affect all industries. But is the world ready for a blockchain shift?

I understand this are very different times but, how bad of a landing was raising interest rates in the 80s by more than 15%? Did it instantly killed inflation? Did the economy enter a drastic delevaraging cycle? How long did it take for this to happen? How did it recover?

Based on the most recent rates of .13% in 2010 to .77% currently; 15% seems like acompletlely absurd  amount. We went from .08% in 2021 to 0.77% in 2022. With this delta, are we expecting inflation to slow down (a decrease in the rate of change)? Or are we expecting for the magnitude of the inflation (based on cpi) to actually decrease?  Based on what they did on the 80s 0.7% sounds exremely low to actually impact consumers spending, but maybe im wrong.

This question is meant for really experience traders because I'm not and I dont want to be deceived by people who dont know.

personalfinance,Buying a new car and curious about financing,I recently put a deposit down on a 2022 Civic Sport Hatchback at MSRP and am wondering the best way to finance the purchase. The car should be delivered around the end of July so I have a little time to make a decision. I’m currently looking at an auto loan rate of 3.7% for 5 years. Would it be better to put a very small down payment and invest the other cash or put a larger down payment to reduce the monthly car payment?

personalfinance,(US) How should I invest,"So I am wondering how I should invest, I will lay out the ground work of why I really don't know what to do. 22 Y.O.

* I am a public employee with a contract that makes it hard to get rid of me. I also have a pension that makes it where I can retire ""comfortably"" when I hit 56.
* I have a second job to pay for college and some medical stuff (it's not hard to guess what for).
* I will be almost completely out of debt by the end of the month, everything else would be a car loan and student loans. Car loan is at 4.99% Interest. Student loans IDK as this is my first year in college and they are federal unsubsidized.
* Looking over my budget, I will have around 10k to invest with yearly. I am not a big fan of putting the money in accounts like 401(K)'s or others that give penalties for withdrawal.
* I am planning on putting the first 3k into my Navy Federal Account that provides \~3.0% interest (Ik it's not the greatest ROI, but for guaranteed returns with no risk, its pretty good.). Their Special EasyStart Cert, in case you were wondering.

My goal is within 5 years to be able to afford a 20% down payment on a house that is around 150-200k.

Before I get more comments about this, I will explain why a 401(k)/tax deferred account isn't smart. 

A) There is no employer match.

B) my tax rate is low, meaning I WILL be paying higher taxes when it comes time to pull out the funds

investing,Core PCE Inflation Increased Lower Than Expected In May,"From the article:

&gt; Let’s start with PCE numbers for May: headline came in +0.6%, 3x what we saw the previous month but only a tick higher than the +0.5% analysts were expecting. When we strip out volatile food and energy costs, we get a “core” headline PCE read of +0.3%, 10 basis points (bps) below what analysts were expecting. This tells us the inflation pain was mostly on the food and energy side last month. Duh.

&gt; What most inflation-watchers, including the Fed, pay close attention to are the year-over-year PCE numbers, and here we’re pretty close to expectations as well: +6.3% on headline (in-line with estimates) and +4.7% on core (+4.8% expected, +4.9% in April). Of course, PCE data is drawn from a series of other economic inputs released previously, so surprises are usually modest at best.

&gt; Where we see some real mashing of the fruit last month is in the Income/Spending areas: while Personal Income gained +0.5% as expected, Real Personal Consumption posted a big drop-off: -0.4% versus a downwardly revised +0.3% the previous month. Adjusted consumption came in at half of expectations to +0.2%, following another downward revision to +0.6% the prior month.

Long time sub and casual reddit user. I've seen some great success stories in here and I am hoping that I can be the next one. I know with that takes some careful decision making but I feel like I should be in a position to clear my debt faster than I am and I'm wondering if any of you brilliant people would pull any of my financial levers to help me break out of this debt.

&amp;#x200B;

The debt I am mainly looking to clear right now is my CC debt. Its been snowballing and some poor decisions have made it worse. I keep reminding myself of this quote I once saw and I try to never forget it. ""You can't change the beginning but you can start where you are now and change the ending"" This is where I am at now in my debt journey. Here's what I am working with...

&amp;#x200B;

Total CC Debt: $16,600

CC Debt in zero interest balance transfers: $9500

Other CC Debt with 0% interest for at least another 9 months: $2800

CC Debt with interest rates between 17-23%: $4300

Current savings including emergency funds: $3000

Vested RSUs: $4500

Personal investments: $1400

&amp;#x200B;

Assets: home, car

Mortgage: $1900 with $175k in home equity (receive $900 per month on rent)

Car/Insurance: $470

Other Monthly expenses (utilities, phone, etc.): \~$400

Net Monthly Income: $5300

&amp;#x200B;

Some financial levers I have considered:

\- HELOC loan

\- Loan taken against my 401k

&amp;#x200B;

What I have been doing is putting about $75-100 per month on all my CC accounts that have a balance. The problem I know I now have is I have too many CCs. My plan is to cancel all of these once my debt is paid off and I will keep my lowest interest CC as my main and only CC going forward once debt is cleared completely.

The good news houses are between 600-700k in the new area so affordability won’t be a problem.  Bad news, interest rates are sky high. Should I put a large down payment and pay a high interest rate on the balance? Invest the money and wait until inflation hopefully subsides to refi?

stocks,Rising interest rate will stop at some point or the Federal will run out of funds,"Fed is rising the interest rate since 2022 but it increased the cost of Federal’s borrowings too, limiting its ability to boost the economy with fiscal stimulus when it goes down to a recession.

Let’s do a simple math, currently the Federal’s annual interest expense is about $666B, it comprises of payment to T-bill($3.7T), T-note($2.4T) and other mid or long-term debt totally worth $18T as of 2021 end. Now Fed has said they want the base rate to be raised to 3.5% by year end, so basically it would be an additional 3% burden annually.

As to T-bill this adds $111B interest to be paid annually (3.7*3%), and additional $86B (2.4*3.5%) for T-note, needless to say those longer debt. Therefore the total interest expense would reach AT LEAST $863B.

There is no other way than borrowing more to pay those stuff, given they have much less space to raise taxes or lower spendings. If they keep on rising rates the interest will soon exceed the principal cut, finally we will just circle back to where we were. 

So what we can expected is the Fed will stop rising at some point, in my opinion may less than 3% given the incoming recession, and try to balance off the debt gradually going forward. The market will reach bottom when this info priced in.",finance,1656619753

defi,ZKlend: next-gen money-market on Starknet (zk-rollup),"Hello fam, while searching for new products that could bring something new to the market and bring us out of bearish times, I stepped upon zklend, a money market (MM) on Starknet. Here's a little summary of what I found out about them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starknet (the blockchain)**

zklend are still on their first Dapp testnet (they will eventually have two dapps) so this is still a very early project. Like I said, it's all built on Starknet chain, a Starkware L2. Starknet is a zk-rollup, therefore not like your typical L1 or optimistic L2. The programming language is different (Cairo) and there is only one wallet supporting Starknet so far: Argent X. For now, Starknet doesn't have much activity on it. Although this may feel like a chore for the experienced user who knows the ins and outs of Metamask, all it's chains and all the bridges that connect them, I think this is a good thing for mass adoption. Why you say? because Metamask UX sucks, as we all know it. Argent will bring new features that will improve UX for mass adoption. There will be multicall (batched transactions), session wallets (for gaming) and many more features. Think of it like a next-gen wallet. Think of it like slowly moving away from Metamask (which is not the way to mass adoption)

&amp;#x200B;

So: early project with never-before-seen features on an early chain that allows new QOL features. Cool!

&amp;#x200B;

**zklend**

What are those never-before-seen features you say? Well, zklend has two dapps that work synergetically. The first one is called Artemis and is made for the average DeFi user like you and me. It's really similar to Aave. Deposit collateral, borrow overcollateralized loans. Bluechip tokens, bluechip NFTs and long tail collateral assets will be supported. The interest rate curve will be algorithmic and flexible, just like we're used to.

&amp;#x200B;

The magic happens with the second dapp: Apollo. Apollo is made for bigger players that are ready to go through compliance layers to unlock some financial power. Here you can read: institutions. Apollo users will be able to borrow undercollateralized loans from the people depositing on Artemis, all with fixed-term interest rates. This is powerful. For now, real credit is mostly an offchain thing, as all blockchain loans are currently overcollateralized. This could all change with zklend. Institutions will now be able to borrow using the ease and transparency of DeFi all while unlocking TradFi power. The more there is demand for capital from institutions, the more DeFi users will be able to profit from lending their money, the more retail will be attracted, and so on. And since Apollo will require compliance (like KYC), there is no fear to be had that institutions will just run away with their undercollateralized loans.

&amp;#x200B;

So for the first time ever, undercollateralized loans will be possible through DeFi. This has the potential to bring institutional money in the space through real-world utility: a borderless, almost frictionless, efficient and transparent financial system

&amp;#x200B;

**So what now?**

As of now, zklend isn't live yet, but [Artemis is ready to go on testnet](https://medium.com/zklend/artemis-product-reveal-starknets-native-money-market-protocol-403f8da7aca3). There is still time to research on the whole ecosystem, get the feel of [Argent X](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/) (the only wallet supporting Starknet so far), and think about how you wanna invest in this. So far, there is no token, but there are multiples ways you can get involved. My advice is to check out their [website](https://zklend.com/) to find the link to their discord &amp; Twitter. From there you can start digging up by yourself as new info comes up. I advise you also look at [Starkware](https://starkware.co/)'s socials, as their chain is also developing and understanding it's landscape will be critical in deploying your strategies. Right now, the only way to bridge money on Starknet is through it's bridge Starkgate (allowing bridging from Ethereum).

personalfinance,What is the point of CDs?,"The more I learn about personal finance, the less it makes sense to me why someone would want to tie their money up in an ~~illiquid~~ investment that doesn’t even keep up with inflation. 

One caveat could be older people who are concerned solely with low-risk wealth preservation, but a friend of mine (28m) got angry and defensive recently when I mentioned my thoughts on this. 

Help me understand why anyone younger than 50 would choose CDs over HYSA, I-bonds, index funds, etc.

Edit: Thanks everybody for chiming in. This discussion has probed my blindspot and changed my views on CDs to the point where I will likely consider them as an option going forward. A couple key takeaways: 

- CDs used to pay double-digit interest in the 80s, which explains why many older people (and those directly influenced by their mentalities) view them as an investing tool. 

- “Locking in” a good interest rate for a set period is a key component of CDs that makes a lot of sense in some savings situations, something I actually hadn’t thought of. 

- CDs will likely make more sense than I-bonds (what I currently hold for mid-term savings) once inflation settles down.",finance,1656626837

personalfinance,"PhD student... do I cut my losses now, or do I stick in the program?","I am struggling with a major decision: I am thinking that I might leave my PhD in psychology. I am in my early 30s. I already have my masters in psychology, and I am already licensed. Getting my PhD is something that I wanted for over a decade, so it’s strange to me that I feel this way. 

Prior to this PhD, years ago, I pursued my masters degree in psychology. However, I was not wise in selecting a school and really considering the burden of the tuition (it was a private school). That program (along with my undergraduate debt) placed me into 6 figures of federal loan debt. So, after graduating, I worked in public or nonprofit organizations, was enrolled the PSLF program, and was making IBR payments on my loans. As you can imagine, salary was low and interest was accruing on my debt. During this time, getting into a doctoral program kept nagging at the back of my brain. 

Then I went through a huge break up right when COVID hit. My life felt aimless. I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and really try to break out of my mold. I applied to a slew of jobs, as well as doctoral programs. To my surprise, in February of 2021, I got a job offer that finally paid me incredibly well (between 80-90k, and it qualified for the PSLF program), and I got into a PhD program that was “funded” (I use quotations, because the funding only lasts for 2 years… tuition is covered for Fall and Spring, but not summer, and the stipend pays not even enough to cover rent). 

However, since I’ve gotten to my program, I’ve had an odd sense of regret. I have not felt supported by the faculty. For example, there is one particular faculty member who is known to be quite toxic, but they are tenured. That faculty member seems to have it in for me, and, I have heard that they have held students back. Additionally, I have found in a broader sense that the program is disorganized (outdated website, poor working relationships with practicum sites, not even guaranteeing hours for practicum, out of date resources, etc.). The most frustrating part is, is that I feel like my advisor basically hates me. I find myself walking on eggshells around them (other students have felt this way as well, “that’s just the way they are.”). Basically, I feel like I’m in a giant Mean Girls sequel instead of a goddamn professional program.  

I have quickly realized that I don’t want to enter academia. The only real reason why I would want to complete this program is to become specialized in assessment (such as neurology, or forensics), because that is where the money is. For example, forensic assessment can pay $1,500 per eval if contracted in certain states, or, you can charge upwards of $200.00 an hour if you're private practice. A fulltime caseload I've heard is 6-10 clients, but I am not sure how fast referrals come and how quickly you can close them. I can already provide therapy as it is at the master’s level, so there's that. 

Recently, I have had an opportunity to return to my old job. While I haven’t been given a formal job offer, I anticipate it will come my way. 

If I stick in the program, I anticipate I’ll be around 250k in debt. If I leave the program, I’ll have about 190k in debt, but at least I could resume the old PSLF-qualified job and get 90% of my loans forgiven in about 6 years. But I feel so frustrated about the thought of leaving, about ""giving up"" on my dreams, feeling preoccupied with how others will view me (I know that it ""doesn't matter"" but right now, with how I feel, it unfortunately does).

Has anyone else felt conflicted about leaving, or felt disillusioned about their PhD program?

I’ve gone to therapy over this, journaled, done a lot of soul searching, talked to other professionals in the field (some have said to stick with the program whereas others have said to cut my losses). 

What the hell do I do? What questions do I need to ask myself to figure this out? I feel so stuck.",finance,1656627162

personalfinance,"Switching jobs and need money for expenses. Sell stocks, go into credit card debt or get a small loan?","Going to be switching jobs and don’t anticipate income for the next month, didn’t realize cobra insurance was going to be so expensive and someone broke into my car window. Last night so I’ve racked up about $1500 in unexpected bills in 24 hours. I asked my dad for advice and he says he will ultimately help me out, but we don’t honestly have a great relationship so I’ve never asked him for money as I know he uses situations like that against people later on. He says the other option is to sell stocks and that taking a loan or going into credit card debt are bad options…

I understand credit cards have high interest rates and being late will affect my credit score. Because of this, I was thinking about taking out a $2000 loan  solely intended for having money on hand if another unexpected event occurs. I am under the assumption it would be a lower interest rate than a credit card and won’t affect my credit score. I’m also skeptical of selling stocks right now as they are all at low points so I would definitely be losing $ that way too. 

Note: I am aware one of the biggest rules is to have a rainy day fund, however I’m only 26 and have a DUI and went to rehab twice, so I’ve incurred a lot of expenses over the last couple years. About 6 months without booze now though so trying to turn my shit around and deal with my finances in the smartest way possible.",finance,1656629230

MachineLearning,[D][P] Ideas about how to model from a dataset with columns containing arrays of data?,"Hello. I have built a dataset that contains results of experiments I have been doing over some physical materials. Each row contains summary data for each piece, like width, height, weight, etc. Then I have several columns which values are arrays.

Each one of these columns contain a list of tuples, for example (162636363, 1373.8377). The first number is a timestamp, the second one the magnitude of a force applied to the material (or, for instance, the position where the force was applied, contact duration, etc.). We have hundreds or even thousands of tuples on each column. So, all columns represent measurements of the experiments done to a particular material.

We are recording when the material is damaged, since we want to predict its lifetime when the material is exposed to repetitive forces.

I'm wondering what to do with those array values. One option is to sort the tuples lists by timestamp and then treat the readings as a vector of a predefined dimension. But I have never fed this kind of data to a boosted tree model/framework like XGBoost.

The only experience I had feeding long vectors to a model was when doing some NLP, in that case the vectors were representations of words.

Do you think a vector made of all my experiments over a material can be treated as an embedding in a way? If so, how is the recommended way to proceed with this data in the modeling stage? Time series perhaps?

I'd appreciate your ideas and comments.

stocks,"Wanted to Share a great Value Analysis of Solo Brands $DTC, Q2 earnings has great potential, take a look, let me know what you think.","## Introduction and Thesis

Operating via four separate sites, Solo Brands (NYSE:DTC) utilizes its expertise in direct-to-consumer e-commerce to drive sales in outdoor lifestyle products. Since its founding in 2011, Solo Brands has grown by the addition of three brands, offering adequate diversification, and shows no plans in slowing down this expansion both in new brands and in entering various global markets. Having started with one brand, Solo Stove offering outdoor heating and cooking solutions, they have since been able to offer clothes, kayaks, and paddle boards with multiple site additions.

Despite stable revenue streams that are poised to grow substantially in the future according to analysts (69.9% FWD), shares have begun trading at an extreme discount to what Solo Brands has to offer. Add in an improving business model that has clearly outlined company objectives with a promising technical rebound, shares should have no trouble ascending to previous levels once this value is realized.

## Catalysts; Driving Future Growth

Down massively from all-time highs achieved near its late October IPO, Solo Brands has not shown any radical deterioration in fundamentals that would give reason to it now being considered as a penny stock (sub $5 per share). Despite this fall that many attribute to inflationary concerns among consumers, management appears driven to abide by their five-step growth model which should give way to immense shareholder returns. Chief Executive Officer John Merris has set the company's focus on the following: product innovation, leveraging customer data, entering new markets, improving customer relations, and continuing acquisitions. In order, we will be looking over each dynamic and see what value can be introduced to Solo Brands and why, together, they lead to a bullish stance.

#### Product Innovation

Looking to further take advantage of excellent gross margins (currently around 66%), Solo Brands continues development across each of their four brands in order to ensure each customer's needs, and any gaps within the market, are fulfilled. In fact, each of their four brands have done quite well given a focus on innovation thus far; for instance, their Solo Stove brand recently introduced heat deflectors to their line up and in the words of John Merris:

&gt;Our much anticipated heat deflectors, rolled out in the first quarter and we have sold over 26,000 units, which is well ahead of our internal expectations"" (Q1 earnings Call).

Assuming this trend of outpacing expectations to show up in each of the brands, as it already has in Oru recently offering an introductory-level Kayak, catering innovation to customer needs will further revenue growth.

#### Leveraging Customer Data

Making use of their customer database, containing 3 million shoppers, Solo Brands intends to further their ability to both innovate (understanding customer needs) and bring customers between different sites. So far with the latter, they have had 42,677 customers who have purchased from more than just one of their sites. Recently, there has been continued interest among management to take advantage of this opportunity:

&gt;We believe that the investments we are making to mobilize our data should yield significant returns this year and for the years ahead"" (Q1 earnings Call).

#### Entering New Markets and Building Relations

Having already gained momentum in several regions beyond the United States, such as Canada and certain parts of Europe, Solo Brands is allowing their flagship brand, Solo Stove, to lead the way into new markets; namely, Australia in the third quarter. From there, they intend to slowly introduce new brands into Australia as more customer data is obtained to more effectively market their different outdoor products.

In entering and expanding in these new markets, of which they believe they have under 2% of the market share for each brand, they are looking to form closer customer relations. With those relations, so far, they have boasted a positive referral rate of approximately 40% and with such a large, established, customer base, they are looking to capitalize on these positive interactions to further future sales. Especially as Solo Brands remains committed to expanding its product offerings via new acquisitions, their strong shopper base which consists of 50% returning customers looks to provide generous returns whenever entering a new market.

#### Strategic Acquisitions

Building upon their intentions to further penetrate the outdoor lifestyle market beyond their 2% share is the potential for future acquisitions that fit into their current portfolio of brands. With that, they would also take advantage of their Net Promoter Score in the 70s indicating they would be able to continue transferring customers from one site to another with relative ease.

&gt;We continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and are enthusiastic about the opportunities we are seeing. Our focus here is unchanged and we look to find unique, disruptive, profitable brands"" (Q1 Earning Call).

## Valuation

Given the difficulty which comes with utilizing a DCF in the case of a startup, or at least a business that has high levels of cash flow fluctuations, making use of public comparable appears to be the greatest approach in gaining a deeper understanding of how Solo Brands is trading so cheap. A great example of such a peer would be American Outdoor Brands (AOUT) which, like Solo Brands, is over 70% off highs in light of inflationary concerns. Despite this, American Outdoor still trades at a higher multiple of over 6x earnings even with less promising revenue growth entering the near-term future. Add in their less-attractive gross margins, one may see that Solo Brands is being overlooked given its likely-superior fundamentals.

Even after calculating a Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS) lower than where shares are trading today ($2.02 versus $4.31), the trend in lowering shares outstanding should aid in the process of placing this number above where shares can be acquired. This strong likelihood comes when looking at the company's historical reduction in shares outstanding, enabling the NCAVPS to increase comfortably.

## Technical Strength; Moving Off Lows

With inflation being the primary culprit in share prices falling heavily from all-time highs achieved following the 2021 IPO, solid earnings since have proven consumers are not abandoning outdoor living products. Especially considering that the products which Solo Brands offers across its various sites are specifically tailored towards the needs of their customers (proven by their substantial customer relations), it is highly unlikely that this trend of impressive sales will let up anytime soon. Foreseeing a bright future fundamentally in Solo Brands, technical analysis reinforces that now is the time to invest in this well-diversified, deep value, stock.

Seeing that a level of support has been formed around the $4 mark, a secondary rebound off this point would lead to the belief that this is a potential double bottom scenario wherein there is (historically) a 78.5% chance of success that it leads to a bullish trend afterward. Furthering the possibility for a bullish trend is the positive movement in the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) that appears to have enough momentum for entering a bullish period in the coming weeks and months. Given the technical strength, share price appreciation looks promising both in the short term and eventually, backed by an excellent business model, moving into the distant future.

## Risks Moving Forward

Like most other equities, Solo Brands has faced a fair share of inflationary pressure, as reflected in their share price decline since its IPO, a time wherein the dollar has lost 4.65% of its value according to the CPI. And although management has advised that fluctuations in their earnings will persist into the second quarter, they are doubling down on their earlier-proven strategy of growth.

&gt;\[C\]onsumers \[are\] continuing to feel the pressures of higher inflation, which is impacting their spending. In times like these we believe offering innovation becomes increasingly important"" (Q1 Earnings Call)

This dedication to improving the underlying business despite a slight hiccup in sales indicates a long-term focus for management, something that can be appreciated given the current, low, multiple Solo Brands is trading at. Furthering their long-term outlook is the lack of dividend payments, instead, this revenue is diverted to fuel further growth in light of another risk: heightened rates. So far, increasing interest rates have been navigated quite well; namely, their earlier acquisitions (all three of which occurring in 2021) should allow the company to weather (possibly avoid) expensive funding. Eventually, when more cash is on hand (currently $15.9M), the company can comfortably move into additional acquisitions as per their outlined plan.

## Final Thoughts

With inflation taking a hit on almost every company in some measure, Solo Brands has seen similar damage to their share price, but not necessarily to their fundamentals. During this time, management has taken steps to ramp up growth prospects and has allowed investors the opportunity to take advantage of this deep value. With technical factors pointing to nearby gains, fundamental factors will more than likely continue this trend well into the future. With that, share prices should have no issue ascending to IPO-level prices and, depending on how management's plan performs entering the distant future, much higher.
