personalfinance,Fact or fiction? Paying your credit card twice a month will improve your credit score faster?,"Hi all,

I made some mistakes in the past when I first joined the military and bought a brand new car out of my budget. Luckily, I was able to get a sub 3% interest rate. That was 2 years ago and I have since made on time payments for the last 2 years with my last payment being completed last month. I keep hearing people tell me to make a payment on my credit card 15 days before the due date and another one 3 days before it to incur two payments and thus build my credit score faster. Is this true and if it is, then would the payments be due before the minimum payment due date or the statement date? Also if all this is hocus pocus then what should I do to build my credit besides on time payments, keeping a low debt to income ratio, and monitoring my credit? Thanks!",finance,1656634741

personalfinance,Should I redeem 30 year bonds prematurely?,"My dad bought 30 year bonds when I was a baby and put them in my name. Unfortunately, he passed when I was 11 so I can't ask him for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, with the state of the economy and inflation being so high, is it worth it to allow them to reach maturity? I understand Federal Reserve raising interest rates means that I am getting better ROI than before. Was planning on using this money to pay off my only debt (car loan) or re-invest into stocks/IRA. They are around 26 years of age out of 30 years.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Final question. Why do you think my dad put this money in bonds? My dad was a very smart man and I'm surprised he put money away for me in bonds instead of choosing stock market (considering it's performance over the last 50 years)? I understand fiscal policy was very different when my dad was growing up and alive. But mathematically speaking, stock market has always outperformed bonds.

The only justification I can sense is the theory of ""slow and steady wins the race"". Do you think he was trying to teach &amp; show me when I got older that small/slow investing is smarter than big/risky investing?",finance,1656645947
personalfinance,Would having 1 credit card at 70% utilization hurt my credit score if my overall utilization is below 30%?,"Recently, I got this new credit card that has 0% balance transfer. I transferred some CC balance from a higher interest card. Last month, an emergency came up and I I used this card since it has 0%. My overall credit utilization is below 30%, but this one card has around 70% usage.

I'm trying to figure out which cards to pay first. Should I focus on paying my cards with the highest interest rate first and do min payments for this card? Or focus on keeping each CC below 30% utilization for best credit score improvement?",finance,1656646143
personalfinance,"Living abroad, considering abandoning student loans","Roughly 10 years ago, I graduated from university with about $250k in student debt. I refinanced this debt with a private lender, and no loans remain with the federal government. I've been diligent with payments since graduation, and have reduced the principal down to $100k. However, now that I'm living abroad, I'm no longer making anywhere close to my old salary. I have no intention of returning to the US. The student loan payment is currently about 40% of my take home pay, on a 30-year term. The lender is not willing to do income-based repayment, stating that refinancing to the 30-year term gets the monthly payments as low as they can go.  


I'm struggling to find a good reason to continue paying off the loan, as I have no assets in the US (other than a 401k, which from my understanding cannot be seized by creditors), and no cosigners on the loan that would be responsible. In the unlikely event I return to the US in the future, my earning potential there is high enough that poor credit would not likely pose a serious problem.  


Am I missing any obvious problems if I decide to do this? It seems hard to justify that retaining a good US credit score, which I likely may never need, is worth 40% of my paychecks for 30 years.",finance,1656647375
personalfinance,[HELP!] Inherited a Large Traditional IRA - Tax Nightmare,"I recently found out that I had a 1.3-million-dollar inheritance and started making an investment plan but then was told that because it is a traditional pre-tax IRA I need to fully withdraw the entire balance within 10 years due to new laws passed in 2019. I'm struggling to figure out what the best financial decision is since it is a very complicated problem.

For years 1-6 I will make 80k spouse will make 180k total combined 260k in California which already puts us in a pretty high tax bracket (35% federal 9.3% state = 44.3% total). After that, we will make 630k, putting us in the highest tax bracket possible (49.3%).

It's a bit discouraging that I'll end up paying essentially half (600k) in of this inheritance in taxes - I don't really see a way to avoid it. If I split up the distributions to be within the first 6 years of lower income thats 216k/yr which pushes me to 476k/yr for a total tax rate of 46.3%, saving only 3% from the top possible tax rate. I have a job with a 3-year contract in California for now, and the next job will likewise have a 3-year contract (medical training). If I choose a state without state income taxes I could take everything out those 3-years and just pay the 37% federal income tax and forego the state taxes. I'm not sure I really want to commit to living in one of those states though but wasting an extra 120k in taxes seems like a dumb financial move.

As someone new to investing the strategizing is a bit dizzying. Is it better to let the money be and have more tax-free compounding then pay a big tax bill later? Or withdraw it earlier and let it accrue capital gains which are taxed lower than regular income?

Thanks for your thoughts, I really appreciate it",finance,1656647481

retirement,"I retired today, no regrets","I worked at the same company for almost 37 years, working my way up to a very senior engineering position. I gave 18 months notice and stayed an extra 6 months after that part time, to facilitate transition and see a pet project of mine get completed. It turns out the replacement they hired came and went, and the pet project only got staffed a month ago. While disappointing, it’s no longer my problem and I left with a clear conscience and a lot of very positive and touching goodbyes. 

I’m ready for the next chapter and have a hobby business lined up that’s completely aligned with my passions. I have no concern about savings or income but need to get better control over costs, particularly with inflation as it is. I’ll have more time to devote to this and fewer days where we are too tired or busy to cook.

economy,As a fiscal conservative and a Trump supporter this is hard to say. If Trump had promoted better monetary policy the economy would’ve been in better balance and inflation wouldn’t have gotten out of control.,"The Dow nearly doubled in size from the pandemic until about a year ago.  Meanwhile Trump despised the idea of raising interest rates during this time.  He saw it as an inhibitor of growth.

Had he promoted the kind of monetary policy we learned in high school economics, the Fed would’ve been more likely to cooperate and moderate the velocity inflation would take on.

Im probably not entirely accurate here, but its a good place to start a conversation.  Its all conjecture really.  I wish the Fed had tangible policy when it comes to interest rate moderation.  Like if the markets go up more than a certain percentage (10 percent growth per year lets say) they pump the brakes (raise rates 1%… or something like that).  Slow growth is healthier than parabolic growth and our business oriented president may have escalated this issue.  

I cant stand Biden, but I do think he was passed a tough hand in this game of cards. I often wonder how Trump would’ve responded to 8% inflation.

Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization.

vet,After sedation behavior. Worrisome?,"acting odd after sedation

My 7 year old long haired best friend had to go under sedation at the vets yesterday around 2pm to be shaved and have his anal glands expressed. 

Since we've been home, its now 4:15am, he is very restless almost hyperactive id say, hasn't slept, staring blankly into space, extremely hungry and extremely more affectionate than normal; hes constantly rubbing his face on every surface. My vet office is closed since it's a holiday here today. I'm not familiar with the side effects of sedation as it's been quite some time that he's had it. I'm just worried that he hasn't settled in the least bit and slept. He has had half a can of wet food plus I've watched him drink a decent amount of water on two occasions. I should also add that he is constantly purring. This is just all very out of the ordinary for him and I'm so anxious. 

Should I be concerned?

Update: I did see him with his head down as if he was trying to sleep around 5am, so I slept for a bit. He is super super hungry it seems when I got up at 6:30am as he was meowing by his food bowl so I fed him half a can of wet food. He ate that lightening speed. Still doesn't seem himself",cryptocurrency,1656663320
stocks,ASML USD vs ASML EUR,"I've been watching ASML for a while and I use Morningstar's FairValue as one of the indicators. ASML is listed on both NASDAQ and Amsterdam, with FV @ USD800 and EUR696 respectively.

After updating the prices today, ASML USD is 40% below the FV, which I use as a guidance to start a position. However ASML EUR is 35% below. Upon further checking, I realised this is due to EUR has depreciated about 10% YTD against USD. Since ASML is based in the Netherlands, I believe the FV conversion should be from EUR to USD, which means FV in USD should be about $730, making it 35% below FV.

Putting aside whether Morningstar's FV is a good indicator, or whether 35%, 40% below that FV is a good entry price, I'd like to discuss if it's a good idea to convert to EUR to buy the same stock in Amsterdam? With strong USD at the moment, European stocks are already at a discount, and I believe eventually interest rate has to come down, which means USD cannot stay strong forever, so it seems like a good move to take advantage of potential gains in both FX and stock.",finance,1656663369

Trading,Can the US market stage a comeback in the second half of the year?,"Recession fears and tighter monetary policy has the dragged the S&amp;P500 to its worst first-half since 1970, down 21%. 

The index is currently trading around last year’s lows, and despite erasing the majority of last week’s attempted bounce, there is still potential for a rebound in the second-half of 2022. 

Markets are widely expecting another 75bps rate hike from the July FOMC Meeting with Chair Powell committed to doing whatever it takes to bring down inflation. However, we may have already begun to turn the corner following Thursday’s softer-than-expected Core PCE print. 

Similar data leading up to the Fed’s decision at the end of the month could boost speculation that the US central bank has reached peak hawkishness, and when combined with the fact that $SPX has entered in a technical bear-market, buyer’s may find current valuations attractive. 

While there is upside potential stemming from the interest rate side of things, there is still the growing recession concerns to consider. Consumer sentiment is at record lows, and if this reflected in upcoming company earnings along with data signalling an economic downturn, losses could continue to deepen. 

All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see how what the second-half of 2022 has in store.",finance,1656677256

#[Stock futures slip after the S&amp;P 500’s worst first half since 1970](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures slip Friday morning after the S&amp;P 500 closed out its worst first-half performance in decades.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 122 points lower, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Micron Technology shares fell more than 4% in premarket trading on the back of disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.
*****
&gt; Shares of Kohl’s fell 16% premarket after it cut its outlook for the fiscal second quarter, citing softer consumer spending, and terminated talks to sell its business, saying the retail environment has deteriorated since the beginning of its bidding process.
*****
&gt; Thursday marked the end of the second quarter and the first half of the year. For the quarter, the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 16% – its biggest one-quarter fall since March 2020. For the first half, the broader market index dropped 20.6% for its largest first-half decline since 1970. It also tumbled into bear market territory, down more than 21% from a record high set early January.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite were not spared from the onslaught. The 30-stock Dow lost 11.3% in the second quarter, putting it down more than 15% for 2022. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, suffered its biggest quarterly drop since 2008, losing 22.4%. Those losses pushed the tech-heavy composite deep into bear market territory, down nearly 32% from an all-time high set in November. It’s also down 29.5% year to date.
*****
&gt; Those steep first-half and quarterly losses come as investors grapple with sky-high inflation and tighter monetary policy. The core personal consumption expenditures index – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 4.7% last month on a year-over-year basis. While that was slightly below a Dow Jones estimate, it was still near multidecade highs.
*****
&gt; The Fed, in turn, has stepped up its efforts against the surge in prices, hiking by 0.75 percentage point in June. That was its biggest rate increase since 1994.
*****
&gt; Both of these factors have resulted in escalating recession worries. First-quarter GDP contracted by 1.6%, and the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow tracker is pointing to another 1% decline in economic output for the second quarter.
*****
&gt; “If we have any words of comfort, it is that universal losses at this pace rarely take place in successive quarters, but this is not the same as saying that further losses should not be anticipated,” wrote Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management. “This still very much looks to be the middle of the story, the period in which a previously ‘pacific’ outlook is replaced by something far stormier, and we are yet to see any signs that the weather is about to turn for the better.”
*****
&gt; Traders will take in more economic data Friday, with the latest ISM manufacturing index and construction spending numbers set for release at 10 a.m. ET.

defi,FIVE DEFI TOKENS TO ENTER THE WORLD OF DEFI,"In the past year, the number and variety of digital assets operating in the decentralized finance (DeFi) niche have grown considerably, as more and more creative uses of blockchain technology and DeFi are discovered.

As a result, there are now hundreds of digital assets with a primarily DeFi use case, which can cause a great deal of confusion for those seeking to understand the space, as many of these tokens have overlapping functions, while others have virtually none. Actual utility.

To clear things up, we'll discuss five of the most popular DeFi assets today and examine what these tokens can do and how they fit into the current DeFi landscape.

## 1. WRAPPED BITCOIN (WBTC)

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) , which was created by BitGo in 2018, is a simple ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain.

To get Wrapped Bitcoin, you have to deposit native Bitcoin (BTC) in a wallet controlled by one of the various WBTC merchants. These merchants will then work with authorized custodians to issue an identical amount of WBTC as an ERC-20 token and transfer it to you.

This ERC-20 tokenized BTC can be transferred as a regular Ethereum token and can then be used to interact with various Ethereum DeFi protocols and decentralized applications (dApps) or converted back to the equivalent amount of BTC via a simple decapsulation process.

At the time this was written, more than 107,000 BTC, valued at $1.3 billion, were being wrapped as WBTC, making Wrapped Bitcoin the third largest DeFi protocol currently in operation[.](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599)

## 2. UNISWAP (UNI)

The native governance token of the decentralised exchange Uniswap is called Uniswap (UNI). By holding UNI tokens, users can contribute to changing the way the Uniswap protocol works by creating and voting on governance proposals.

The first governance proposal, which attempted to lower the governance proposal and thresholds for&lt;em&gt;quorum&lt;/em&gt;, recently failed despite an overwhelming majority of votes supporting the change, ironically because the&lt;em&gt;quorum&lt;/em&gt;minimum.

If you used Uniswap any time before September 1, 2020, you may have received an unexpected 400 Uniswap (UNI) token airdrop to your Ethereum wallet. At its peak, this airdrop was worth over $3,000, and was sent to over 300,000 wallets, making it one of the most valuable airdrops in history.

## 3. DAI (DAI)

Dai is a type of digital asset known as a stable currency. As the term implies, the value of DAI is designed to remain stable at 1 US dollar (USD) per coin, thus resisting the volatility that most other digital assets are known to experience.

Unlike other stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), DAI is not directly collateralized by US dollars in a bank account. Instead, DAI is earned by depositing Ethereum (ETH) into a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) smart contract. Once deposited, up to 66% of the USD value of the deposit can be borrowed in DAI tokens. To recover the ETH, the DAI that were borrowed must be repaid, plus a small amount of interest.

DAI offers low minimum deposit amounts and since it is not backed by real money, you do not need to complete KYC to purchase it. But there is a risk of possible liquidation and black swan events.

## 4. CHAINLINK (LINK)

Chainlink is a network that provides inputs and outputs of data from various blockchains, allowing smart contracts to obtain reliable information from external real-world sources and helping smart contracts to communicate data securely to platforms that are not. of the blockchain.

This network is done through a decentralized network of oracles, which can be used to feed smart contracts with real-world data, allowing them to react to any changes or execute specific functions based on the data they receive. For example, a smart contract could take data on the current BTC to USD exchange rate, to help decide pricing for a digital asset brokerage.

The LINK token is the native digital asset of the Chainlink ecosystem and is used to pay for nodes (also known as oracles) used to retrieve data and as collateral when running a node. This guarantee can be penalized if the node provides incorrect data, which helps ensure that data providers are reliable at all times.

## 5. AAVE (AAVE)

Aave (AAVE) is the native token of the Aave DeFi non-custodial lending and lending protocol.

Through Aave, you can lend various ERC-20 tokens by depositing them in a variety of lending pools, including those for stablecoins such as DAI and True USD (TUSD), as well as more volatile digital assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Yearn Finance (YFI) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). By contributing to these loan pools, you earn a variable interest rate. These interests are paid by the borrowers, who must also deposit more than 100% of the loan amount as collateral in order to request the loan.

AAVE itself, which came to market in July 2020, is a multifunctional token that can be used to reduce fees and participate in the governance of the Aave protocol. They are obtained by exchanging the platform's old LEND tokens for AAVE at a ratio of 100 to 1 or simply by using the Aave platform to grant or obtain loans.

## CONCLUSION

As DeFi continues to gain momentum, new protocols, tokens, and use cases are likely to be developed, further narrowing the gap between DeFi capabilities compared to CeFi (centralized finance).

The DeFi market is currently worth approximately over $12 billion and has grown over 5,000% in the last two years, making it probably the fastest growing sector today. If this pace of growth continues into the future, the DeFi sector could reach the size of the US stock market of $36 trillion by the mid-2020s and the size of the global banking sector of $124 trillion soon after. .

Even so, you will have to overcome a series of challenges to get to that point. Among them the recent spate of “rug pull” scams.",cryptocurrency,1656679816

About half a year ago I sold one, and put most of the proceeds into Bitcoin.  Just getting a little sour on the rentals because costs keep going up but tenants aren't understanding when I have to raise their rents, but I digress.  So, picked up Bitcoin at about $40,600 back in February-ish.  Also have some gold and silver from a couple years ago when I took out a LOC with the bank.  Fast forward to today, the LOC is coming up for renewal and the bank may well raise the interest rate on it or god knows what (call it in??  God I hope not).  My asset values have plummeted, gold and silver getting hit with silver below $20(!!!) now.  Bitcoin in the total tank and god knows how long before it will recover....

Recently raised rent on a tenant, tried to raise her 20%, which came on the heels of a raise of 10% about a year ago...she served notice she's moving out!  So now I've got to refund her deposit and I've listed it for rent at a huge price, no takers.  I just, can't get the rent out that ""excites"" me on these rentals, and every time I bump my rents it's just a matter of a couple months before I feel like the rent increase isn't enough!  Because my insurance keeps going up and I have to raise the coverage as the houses go up in price...but that doesn't help me unless I sell.  Then I get raked by taxes.  

This whole thing is KILLING me.  I'm seriously thinking about selling them all, paying back all loans, and just getting some low level job and have virtually no income, and try to ride this whole inflation thing out?  I DON""T KNOW WHAT TO DO, GUYS.

I calculated our Annual electricity usage at around 20,000 KWH so I think the coverage of annual usage percentage is way off.

I calculate the Price per watt at $2.39/watt, but that doesn't change regardless of weather I have 20 or 40 panels. Is that normal? Is that something I may be able to negotiate?

I am wanting to get my own financing or personal loan through a bank or credit union.

Also I live with my Mom, but plan to take over the house in the future. Will I still be able to qualify for the federal tax credit if I do everything in my own name? My Mom doesn't want to be involved in the loan or anything and when I did my own research I didn't see anything that said I had to be the owner of the home, just that I had to live there.

Which to pay off first?,"Wife just got back into the work force after taking off 8 months for staying home to take care of kids until they could start school this fall. With us no longer living on a single paycheck and having substantial extra income I want to start paying off some debts while the money is available. We have about $5000 left on my student loans and another $5000 on a car note. Student loans payments are on hold due to Covid, but i've been continuing my $160 payment for the last two years. My interest rate is 5.65% on this loan when payments restart. On the car note the monthly payment is like $210, but I've been paying 300 each month. The interest on this loan is 2.25% so not much. In my mind i'm probably better off to pay off the student loan first, since it has the potential for the highest interest rate. On the other hand the car note is for 2010 CRV so I hate continuing to pay on an older car.   


The other thing i've been considering is just taking money out of savings to pay off one or both of them, and then spending the next 6-9 months rebuilding our savings back. Right now between different budget items we've been saving for I have around $20k in savings so we'd still could have 2 months of emergency fund if i were to pay both off today, and I'd be freeing up $450 a month right to go back into rebuilding our savings.",finance,1656688742

Yay or nay?,"I’ve been improving my credit score to secure a better interest rate on a personal loan to clear some debt and it’s been working. I graduated college last year and started my career which pays more than I’ve ever made before, but just like everyone else my expenses have gone way up and I’m also moving from an apartment to a house which increases my rent and utilities significantly. I’ve recently started monitoring my finances more closely, stopped making unnecessary purchases and have stopped using my credit cards all together. I want to clear my CC debt and have seriously considered consolidating. I have offers up to $35k for a personal loan with interest rates starting at 10.5% for 36-84mo. Currently I have ~$9,500 in credit card debt and ~$2800 owed on my car with 7 monthly payments left. My car payment ($470) combined with paying the minimum on my credit cards which have interest rates starting at 25% costs me ~$730/month. I was thinking of taking out a &lt;$15k loan to pay off my credit cards, my car, an $1800 procedure in the fall and have enough left over to do some much needed maintenance on my car so it’ll last a lot longer. Two loan offers I’m looking at now are $13k for $402/mo for 36mo. and $15k for $469/mo. for 36mo. My concerns are, should I be including my car payment in the debt to be consolidated as I only have 7 payments left? A loan of $9500 would cost me $295 for 36mo, but I would still have a car payment on top of that of $470 a month for the next 7 months and doesn’t leave me much wiggle room to do the things I was planning on putting on my credit card like my procedure and vehicle maintenance. Including my car in the debt to be consolidated seems smart in terms of saving money now but doesn’t seem like a good idea to make a 7month debt into a 36mo. debt.

We are looking to snowball and free up some money for my husband to finish his degree and really don’t want to take on any student loans. 

We’ve been operating on a very strict budget. We just sold my car because we weren’t really using it, so we have more $ to use for savings or dump into one of the debts. Here’s the gist: 

Debts
*anticipated*: Husband school will be $17,500ish over the next year and a half for $550/credit hour. 
Husband CC: $4,166.49 - minimum $45/month, currently putting $280/month (+$50 for next two months due to promotion for train passes being cheaper for that time); no interest for another 19 months
Husband car: $9,436.87 - minimum $260/month; interest rate ?? Working on getting that; 38 months left on it 
My CC: $7,897.15 - no interest for another 19 months — minimum $80/month
My student loan — $36,479.90; minimum $277/month; interest rate 4.45%; 15 year term 

Savings currently - $13,965.15

Total expenditures per month- $3904
(I can break this down if needed, but it includes one phone bill, all doctors visits, groceries, rent, gas, train passes, and debts)

Total without above costs- $3007

Monthly savings- $988

Worth noting that I anticipate a bonus of&lt;$4,200 in December. 


Any recommendations on what we should be paying off first? My thoughts were to put as much as we have leftover from the regular budget each month into his credit card, but the $988 just gets dumped into savings to be used for his school. Thank you SO much for any advice. :):):)",finance,1656699115

I'm interested in doing some major landscaping and building a fence on my property. I should probably be getting a loan of about 2:00 to 5,000 to do this within the next 2 years. And plan on doing the work myself to save money.

Should I just get a private loan through my credit union, or should I be interested in a home equity line of credit? As I understand it, a HELOC would be for a higher amount and a longer term than I would want. But I should be able to just pay it off before due date, right? 

If that's the case, I can pay it off sooner just by saving the money and using the money back against the loan, the only thing I should really worry about is the difference in interest rate between the two types of loans? Go with whichever loan provided a lower interest rate? 

What else am I not thinking about between these two different options? What pros and cons are there between the two? Anything that might bite me that I'm not aware of?

CryptoCurrency,I took out a $20K loan to buy BTC.,"You may remember me from a post back in mid February where I took out a $15k loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tdkaui/taking_out_a_loan_to_buy_crypto_when_the_market/).

Back then, I told myself if Bitcoin ever dropped down to $20k I would take out another loan to buy more. So that's exactly what I did...

I recently got approved for a ***non-secured*** $20k loan with a 4.5% ***fixed APR*** which I will be using to buy more Bitcoin at these discounted prices.

Why now?

You see, the thing is, J. Pow keeps raising rates. The higher he raises rates, the more expensive it is to borrow money. So I'm doing this now to lock in a nice low interest rate.

If the macro situation is really as bad as they say, then BTC may go even lower and I want to capture some of that low price action. This time around, however, I plan to DCA it into BTC much slower than I did with my $15k loan back in February.

The crazy thing is that I managed to get a lower interest rate this time! Back in February, the loan I got was 6% Fixed APR, but with the new $20k loan I'm only paying $4.5%! I think it's because my credit score went from a 757 to a 797.

***Many people ask why not just continue with my normal DCA since I can afford it?*** The reason is that I want to take advantage of two things that will most likely change soon: low APR and low BTC price.

In a few months, interests rates will be higher, J. Powell has promised this. Also, BTC may be higher too, or maybe not. Either way, I like the price of BTC now so I want to jump on it.

I basically view this as a ""***Reverse DCA***"" strategy.  I will still invest the same amount each month, but I will put most of it towards servicing the loan. Together, the combined loans require about $550 a month to service. **I can easily afford this.** Not a big deal. I usually invest about $500-700 a month anyway. In fact, I'll most likely pay both of them off early just so that I save on the interest, not that it's much anyway.

Anyway, I will update in 6 months.

CryptoCurrency,95% Harmony is Done now. Hackers have laundered all the stolen assets,"On 30 June, Harmony team sent the last transaction asking hackers to return stolen assets. They could retain $10M in ETH. If the hackers are willing to do so, they will cease the investigation or manhunt they called.

[https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1542327331426955264](https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1542327331426955264)

Sadly, the hackers ignored all the message from the team and laundered the very last ETH roughly 5 hours ago.

[https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d043128146654c7683fbf30ac98d7b2285ded00](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d043128146654c7683fbf30ac98d7b2285ded00)

What does it mean? 

1. who deposited to the smart contract to bridge token to Harmony chain might not be able to get those assets back.
2. who are holding bridged tokens such as 1ETH, 1WBTC, 1USDC are holding 'basically worthless' tokens now, because no locked tokens on Ethereum chain are backing their existence on the other side.
3. who are holding ONE? I don't know, it's like a sinking ship right now.

I'm not gonna tell you what you should do. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not a financial advice. But be careful with what you are going to be told, because it is like 50/50 bet now.

1. if Harmony team can retrieve stolen assets, which seems to be the case now. They are done. Some said the team could sell their ONE and buy exactly the same amount of stolen assets and deposit back to the smart contract. It is dumb. Their failure leads to $100M hack. Their market cap is $220M, 50% of which is being staked. There is just no chance they could effectively sell enough ONE and buy those stolen assets. And imagine they are going to do so, ONE would drop real real bad.
2. if there is someone or a VC steps in to bail them out, they might have a chance to survive. But the chance is small since liquidity is drained from the market now (due to FED's quantitative tightening).
3. Why I said it is 50/50 chance. because if they are bailed out, those worthless tokens on Harmony chain will be recovered in value, which means if you buy them now (1ETH, 1WBTC, 1USDC), you could make nearly 8x profit if they are pegged again on Ethereum chain.

To me, I'm not gonna make this bet. It is like flipping a coin right now, and if I ever decide to do that, I'm gambling and not investing.

A lot of things happen now on Harmony that a lot of projects are soon moving to other chain like Polygon.

Don't listen to anyone who told you to buy the dip, if they can't give stolen assets back to investors, they are done, so is ONE. Those who told you they are still loving ONE and buy the dip are probably in heavy loss or can't do anything since their ONE is being locked for staking.",cryptocurrency,1656707708

# **Recession fears flare and June jobs report looms as jittery markets head into third quarter - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/01/recession-fears-flare-and-jobs-report-looms-as-markets-head-to-q3-.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors are greeting the third quarter with greater trepidation about a recession, and that makes next Friday’s June jobs report a potentially bigger catalyst for markets than it might otherwise have been.
*****
&gt; The jobs report and Wednesday’s release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last interest rate meeting are expected to highlight the four-day, post-July 4th holiday week.
*****
&gt; June’s nonfarm payrolls are expected to have slowed from the 390,000 added in May, but still show solid job growth and a strong labor market. According to Dow Jones, economists expect 250,000 payrolls were added in June and the unemployment rate held steady at 3.6%.
*****
&gt; But economists expect to see a slowing in the employment data from here out, as the Fed’s tighter rates policy squeezes employers and the economy. There is a chance some of those cracks in the labor market could start to appear in the latest report. Some slowing would be seen as a positive, but there’s a balance between a slower, less hot job market and one that has gotten too cool.
*****
&gt; “Employment should slow from May. Whether it goes to 250,000 consensus or more, there’s always volatility,” said David Page, head of macro economic research at AXA Investment Managers. “The trend is going to be lower, and I wouldn’t mind betting it would be in 150,000 to 200,000 by early Q3, and it could be certainly lower by the end of the year.”
*****
&gt; A rate of 150,000 to 200,000 is still strong and closer to the pre-pandemic pace of job growth.
*****
&gt; Page said there has been a slowing in other data, including consumer spending, income and the employment component of the ISM June manufacturing survey. The employment component fell for a third month to 47.3. A level under 50 signals contraction.
*****
&gt; “That’s part of a trend we’re seeing emerge. It’s very evidently a slowdown in the economy,” Page said. “The warning signs are starting to emerge, and the more we see those warning signs start to trickle into the labor market, the more the Federal Reserve is going to have to take heed and that’s what puts such focus on next Friday’s payroll report.”
*****
&gt; On the other hand, if the jobs number is particularly strong, markets could react negatively since it would mean the Fed would feel forced to move ahead aggressively to fight inflation with larger rate hikes.
*****
&gt; # Fed impact
&gt; “If the employment data is strong, and the Fed officials on paper sound as hawkish as they do verbally, I would think that would continue to put pressure on the market,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “If one of the major barometers of how well higher rates are affecting the economy does not show, it is affecting the economy. The implication or inference would be the Fed still has more to go.”
*****
&gt; Many economists expect the Fed will raise interest rates by another 75 basis points at its next policy meeting in late July, but the path for September is less certain.
*****
&gt; Page said he expects the Fed will debate the size of July’s hike more than the market believes, and the central bank could end up raising rates by a lower-than-expected 50 basis points. A basis point equals 0.01%. Page expects the Fed to be sensitive to the slowing economy and tightening of financial conditions.
*****
&gt; He noted there are few instances in history where the Fed has managed “a soft landing on such a narrow landing strip.”
*****
&gt; A major issue for markets is that the economy can easily fall into recession, and it can be hard to predict. This week market pros became more concerned about an economic downturn, after weaker data and comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Powell indicated the Fed will do what it needs with interest rate hikes to tame inflation, triggering worries the Fed will be willing to bring on a recession to slow price increases.
*****
&gt; “You can be traveling along, then you hit a certain tipping point,” Page said. “It starts with something as amorphous as market sentiment. The market sentiment starts to evaporate...That’s when financial conditions start to tighten...That has a knock on to economic activity.”
*****
&gt; Economists are divided on when and whether the economy will enter a recession, but increasingly markets are pricing in an economic contraction.
*****
&gt; The Atlanta Fed’s GDP Now tracker shows the economy is already in a recession, with a forecast of gross domestic product declining 2.1% in the second quarter. If that forecast were accurate, it would make for a second negative quarter in a row, or what’s considered a recession on Wall Street. The first quarter contracted by 1.6%.
*****
&gt; Other economists, however, are not forecasting a recession for the current period, and Page sees 1.5% growth in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; # New test for stocks?
&gt; Stocks in the past week were sharply lower, as Treasury yields also fell on recession expectations. The 10-year yield stood at 2.89% on Friday, tumbling from 3.49% just two weeks ago. Some strategists had expected to see an up week for stocks as portfolio managers bought equities to rebalance their portfolios at the end of the second quarter.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 1% Friday but was off 2.2% for the week, ending at 3,825. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% Friday, but was down 4.1% for the week.
*****
&gt; “Right now, the market is trying to stabilize with some real quarterly flows,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Redler said if the start of the new quarter and month does not bring in fresh money and support the market in the next several sessions, that will be a negative sign for stocks and could signal that the market will soon test its lows.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is caught between two narratives,” said Redler. “I don’t know if it wants good news or bad news. At first, the hot economic news was bad because the Fed could go another 75 basis points and keep going, but now the market wants softer news. But is the landing going to be soft or hard? It’s like threading the needle right now.”
*****
&gt; Redler said he believes the market is in the “7th inning of this correction.”
*****
&gt; “If you haven’t sold yet, it’s probably not the time to do it. At this point, it’s a high probability that we test the [S&amp;P 500] low of 3,638, and then it’s just a question of whether we make new lows,” he said. “A lot of people are focused on 3,400 on the S&amp;P 500.”
*****
&gt; Strategists say the market will also focus on earnings season, and many expect a choppy reaction once companies begin reporting and lowering future profit guidance. Earnings begin with big banks reporting July 14 and 15.
*****
&gt; “The only bullish narrative the market has right now is it can go up on bad news,” said Redler. “At this point, it’s just a matter of how long this contraction will go that the Fed started. They wanted this.”

&gt; # 2022: Where Nothing Can Go Right

&gt; 2022 has seen the bulls get slugged with a number of heavy blows. The S&amp;P 500 has already experienced 14 separate one-day declines of 2% or more this year. That's nine more than the entire total for 2021!

&gt; While there are still another six months left in the year, only ten other years have seen as many or more 2% daily declines in their entirety! At the current pace, 2022 would see 28 daily declines of 2%+, which would rank as tied with 2009 for the third most in the post-WWII period trailing only 2002 (29) and 2008 (41). Not great company. If 2021 was the year where nothing could go wrong for investors, 2022 has been the year where nothing is going right.

&gt; # Strength Follows Weakness

&gt; Whether you're looking at monthly, quarterly, or first-half performance, this year's S&amp;P 500 performance has been quite weak. As investors, we must avoid falling into the sunken-cost fallacy and are forced to be forward-looking.

&gt; Starting with weak months, there have been a total of 83 months in the post-WWII era in which the S&amp;P 500 declined at least 5%. In fact, this has occurred three times in 2022 alone, and if the current pace continues will top the post-WWII high in 2008 when there were five months of 5%+ declines.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/SP-500-monthly-declines-chart-063022-2.png))**

&gt; In addition to 5%+ monthly declines, we also looked at periods where the S&amp;P 500 declined 10%+, as well as six-month periods when the S&amp;P 500 fell 20%+ (with no prior occurrences in the last three months). Over the following day, performance was inline with the historical average following 5%+ monthly declines and 10%+ quarterly declines, but the first trading day following a six-month decline of 20%+ was much better than the historical average. Over the following week and month, though, the picture looks different as performance after 10%+ quarterly declines has been much better than average while performance following 20%+ six-month declines has been well below average. In terms of the week and month after 5%+ monthly declines, returns have pretty much been in line with the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/Aggregate-Median-Chart-063022.png))**

&gt; Taking a look at positivity rates (percent of the time the S&amp;P 500 has posted gains in a respective period), the S&amp;P 500 has boasted above average rates following a monthly decline of 5%+ in both the next day and month, but rates are lower over the following week. After quarterly declines of 10%+, positivity rates were lower in the following day, but above average for the following week and month, coming in at 61.9% and 71.4%, respectively. On the downside, positivity rates were much lower following the first rolling six month decline of 20%+ in the next week and month, coming in at 40.0% for both. Investors should note that the first occurrence of a 20%+ rolling six month decline occurred on June 16th.

&gt; # Gasoline Burning Up

&gt; As we noted in today's Chart of the Day, inflation data has been moderating and so too have gas prices as demand has pulled back and refinery output rises as we discussed in last night's Closer. Roughly two weeks ago, AAA's national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline peaked just above $5. Granted it is still elevated, but that price has fallen to $4.86 today. Taking one step further up the supply chain, Gasoline futures peaked even further ago on June 9th and have fallen 14.5% since then. As shown in the second chart below, that decline is now putting the past several month's uptrend on the ropes.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/063022-Gas-1.png))**

&gt; While both the national average and gasoline futures have been rolling over, the decline in the latter has been far larger as those prices tend to slightly lead retail prices. As for the size of that disconnect, taking the spread of the one-month percent change of the two measures of gasoline is historically wide at 14.4 percentage points. The last times such a divergence has been observed were earlier this spring, last fall, and back in 2020. In those periods, such divergences were short-lived. As shown in the bottom chart where we overall the AAA national average and Front Month Gasoline futures, moves in the futures market tend to lead prices at the pump, in other words, it is unlikely retail prices will continue to fly in the face of lower futures prices.

&gt; # Where Have All the Bulls Gone?

&gt; After two weeks of sub-20% readings, the share of respondents to the AAII sentiment survey reporting as bullish has risen back up to 22.8%. That increase in optimism comes on what has been pretty choppy price action in the past week as the S&amp;P 500 had risen then given up roughly 3% since the last update of the AAII numbers.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/063022-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment broke a streak of back-to-back-to-back declines, and the opposite shift in sentiment could be seen for bearish sentiment. The percentage of respondents reporting as pessimists fell by 12.6 percentage points in the latest week bringing the reading back below 50%. While the double-digit decline was large, the first week of June actually saw an even bigger drop of 16.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/063022-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; The significant inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment have resulted in the bull-bear spread to move higher, but at -23.9, sentiment continues to heavily favor the bears.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/063022-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; In fact, taking a four-week moving average of the bull-bear spread shows that the reading has been below -10 (meaning on average bears have outnumbered bulls by at least 10 percentage points) for 23 straight weeks. That continues to close in on the record six-month streak that ended in February 1991 as bulls are few and far between.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/063022-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Given the drop in bears this week was far larger than the increase in the number of respondents reporting as bullish, the bulk of the sift went to the neutral camp. That reading rose 8 percentage points to 30.5%. While that only leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of June 9th, it was the largest one-week increase since the last week of March and ranks in the top decile of all week-over-week moves on record.

&gt; # Highest Increases in Short Interest

&gt; As we highlighted in a post yesterday, the relative strength of the 100 stocks with the highest levels of short interest against the Russell 3000 has broken its downtrend. This downtrend had been in place since the end of the meme stock mania in January of 2021. Just to refresh your memory, that chart is provided below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/062822-SIPF-2.png))**

&gt; Today, we took a look at the 20 Russell 1000 stocks that have seen the largest increases in short interest as a percentage of float (SIPF) on a year to date basis. Leading this group is Upstart (UPST), the buy now pay later firm that has been decimated as growth stocks have gotten crushed and consumer confidence weakens to historic levels. UPST saw SIPF rise by 27.1 percentage points on a YTD basis and by an additional 2.0 percentage points in June. Notably, UPST appeared on our Top 20 P/S Decliners list as well, which we published yesterday. Unity Software (U) is the only other name to appear on both lists. The largest names on this list by market cap are GlobalFoundries (GFS), Ubiquiti (UI) and Rocket (RKT).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/Top-20-SIPF-increases-062922-2.png))**

&gt; The performance of these twenty names has been quite weak on a month over month and YTD basis. Additionally, these names have massively underperformed the broader index since the end of the meme stock mania, trading down by 48.7% on average (median: -63.3%) compared to the Russell 1000's loss of just 1.1%. On a YTD basis, these stocks have shed 44.1% of their value on average, which was accelerated by a 12.6% average loss since the end of May. Although it's difficult to find any positivity in these names, they are primed for short squeezes or reversals as shorts cover their positions (which forces buying.

&gt; # 3% Daily Declines in QQQ

&gt; There's no questioning that markets have been extremely volatile this year. Yesterday, the Nasdaq 100 tracking ETF (QQQ) declined by 3.0%, which for 2022, has not been a foreign occurrence. In fact, yesterday was the eleventh time this year that QQQ fell by at least 3%. Since QQQ began trading in 1999, this will be the fifth-highest number of 3%+ daily declines in the first half of the calendar year (top chart below). Although the number of 3%+ daily declines is still well below 2020 and dot-com era levels, it is still a significantly elevated reading. In fact, this year's first-half pace has been well ahead of levels from 2008 and 2009 and is only three shy of the pace in 2020.

&gt; Volatility has not been exclusively to the downside, though. On top of the 11 3%+ declines, there have been nine days so far in 2022 in which QQQ rose by at least 3%, bringing the total number of absolute daily moves of 3%+ to 20. This too ranks fifth of all years since 1999, falling five short of 2020 and 31 short of 2000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/QQQ-3-pct-moves-first-half-FY-062922.png))**

&gt; Of all 260 3%+ daily declines in QQQ since 1999, 143 occurred between the start of 2000 and the end of 2002 (the unwinding of the dot-com bubble). During this time, QQQ fell a whopping 74.3%! The chart below shows QQQ since 1999, with the red dots marking each 3%+ decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/QQQ-3-pct-declines-graph-062922.png))**

&gt; QQQ's performance following these occurrences is heavily skewed by the dot-com era weakness. While performance over the following week has been slightly better than average versus all periods since 1999, forward returns in the following one and three months have trailed the long-term averages. Since the end of the dot-com bubble burst (2003), forward returns following these occurrences looks much more attractive with QQQ averaging a gain of 44 bps (median: 54 bps) in the week following a decline of 3%+. Over the following month, QQQ has averaged a gain of 1.4% (median: 1.6%) and over the next three months has averaged a gain of 7.3% (median: 7.2%). The positivity rates over the following week, month, and three months have been 57.6%, 58.3%, and 74.5%, respectively.

&gt; # Stocks with the Largest Price to Sales (P/S) Declines

&gt; It's no secret that there has been a massive pullback in valuation multiples, and stocks that had higher multiples have been hit much harder by the recent market pullback. This comes as rate hikes increase the discount rate and the era of ""free money"" comes to an end, which inherently lowers the risk appetite of investors. The chart below shows the price to sales (P/S) spread between the Russell 1000 growth index and the Russell 1000 value index. Naturally, growth stocks should always trade at higher multiples, but the spread became magnified throughout the pandemic. The spread peaked in mid-November 2021 at 3.7, but it has contracted by 1.8 points to 1.9 as of today's open. Whereas the growth index has seen its P/S ratio decline by 36.4%, the value index has only seen a P/S decline of 13.0%. The growth index currently has a P/S ratio of 3.6, compared to 1.7 for the value index. The P/S spread between the two indices is now inline with pre-COVID levels, so the stretched growth multiples of the pandemic-era have come full circle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/Price-to-sales-spread-g-v-v-062822-2.png))**

&gt; Dissecting this further, we took a look at the 20 Russell 1000 stocks that have seen their P/S multiples compress the most since their respective 52-week highs. Leading this group is Lucid (LCID), which has seen the P/S ratio decline by a whopping 275,309 points. This comes as sales increased substantially and the price declined significantly (-68.2% since the 52-week high). Even still, LCID's P/S ratio remains in the stratosphere at 359. Next on this list is Norwegian Cruise (NCLH) and Carnival (CCL), which have experienced a similar phenomenon. Sales fell off a cliff for the cruise lines following COVID, causing their P/S ratios to spike. As sales have returned on the re-opening and share prices have continued to decline, P/S ratios have fallen significantly. The largest decliners in share price since their respective 52-week highs on this list are Upstart (UPST), DocuSign (DOCU) and Unity Software (U), which have declined by 90.4%, 79.0% and 78.9%, respectively. Upstart has seen its P/S ratio fall from 37.8 down to 3.0. The median stock on this list trades 10.8 times LTM sales, which is still aggressive to say the least. Most stocks topped out either last summer or in October/November.

As you can see, the vast majority are in sustained downtrends. However, if interest rate pressures subside and risk appetites increase, these twenty names could benefit through multiple expansion.

&gt; # Stocks on 7+ Month Losing Streaks

&gt; The US stock market has been weak and in a downtrend since late 2021, and there are some individual names that haven't been able to post a positive month in quite some time. Of all S&amp;P 1500 members, there are actually eight stocks with a market cap of at least $2 billion that are on a monthly losing streak of seven or more months. Six of these eight names are members of the Consumer Discretionary sector (the worst performing sector on a YTD basis), which is down 27.8% in 2022 (as of Friday's close). The largest company on this list is Nike (NKE), which reports after the close today. The stock would need to gain about 7.5% through the end of the month to break its seven month losing streak. The average stock on this list would need to gain 6.7% through the close on 6/31 to break their respective streaks. Etsy (ETSY) is the closest to breaking its streak, needing to gain just 0.9%, while Under Armour (UAA) is the furthest, needing 13.7%. On a YTD basis, these stocks are down an average of 41.4% (median: -35.0%), meaning they would need to gain ~70% through year's end to finish 2022 in the green.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/7-and-8-month-losing-steaks-062722-2.png))**

&gt; Below is a quick look at one-year price charts for these eight stocks. (You can click here to create a custom portfolio of these names if you're a Bespoke client.) Unsurprisingly, these stocks on 7+ month losing streaks are trading in pretty steep long-term downtrends, and they've got a lot of work to do to get back to where they were trading late last year. New uptrends can't emerge until these long monthly losing streaks finally come to an end.

Given current 30Y interest rates &gt;6%, would it be wise to consider a 15Y mortgage if we can comfortably afford the monthly payments? I’m seeing 15Y interest rates .8-.9% lower compared to 30Y, and online calculators show about $4000 total payment (2.5% property tax in TX) for a 15Y vs $3300 30Y for a $344k mortgage (looking at houses around $430k and expect to put 20% down).. only $700 more a month is doable with our current income, and my thought is we can always refinance another 15Y if money gets tight or rates go lower.

CryptoCurrency,A possible great crypto crash?,"I’ve been investing in the crypto market since 2020, I made my entrence during the COVID crash made descent gains by investing and leveraging alt coins during the 2021 crypto boom

And now in 2022 I’m buying up ETH And BTC in hopes of scooping them up at a discount, but I know times seem uncertain right now with the war in Ukrain and the whole debacle of the US government rising interest rates and the trade lines slowing down. 

I get it it looks bad doesn’t it

But I’ve been reading up on the stock market crash of 1929 and will provide an article I’ve been reading about the stock market crash what led up to it, and the economic fallout that preceded it now known as the Great Depression.

One interesting thing I’ve taken from the article is that the events that lead up to the crash are similar to what is happening in the crypto market now. 

In 1929 people were buying up stocks with loans or with margins through stock brokers

This caused stock prices to surge in price and interest rates to skyrocket 

Much of what we have been seeing in the past few years with the stock and crypto markets now

During the great crash many investors tried to sell their stocks as prices tumbled 

This resulted in the inevitable causing the Great Depression that followed soon after

My point is that I’m seeing a lot of the same signs especially in the crypto market now, although the government is trying to lower interest rates now

But we’re still seeing stock and crypto prices fall pretty drastically 

I’ve been stoic so far, but in hearing the news of major crypto exchanges stopping withdraws and interest earnings seems like the beginnings of a crypto crash maybe? I hope not, but history seems to be repeating itself

Asking because I'm considering gifting him a savings bond, to take advantage of the crazy initial interest rate Series I bonds have right now.

It also means we're able to get by with only one vehicle.

The reasons we aren't legally married/aren't getting legally married until the situation changes:

So I've got no credit history (I'm assuming) but I want to be able to move out sooner rather than later and also get a newer vehicle. I know having credit can help people get things like this done so I was looking into a credit builder loan that sounded very interesting and was thinking about trying (I don't know the interest rate if that matters). I talked to probably the only person I go to for advice about things like this when I started my job because he has a lot of life experience and I trust his input on matters like this (My Dad) but he said building credit was one thing he regrets doing (I know he has a good credit score) and that paying with cash or just your available funds makes things much easier( which is basically what I've been doing I guess). But I like I said Im not knowledgeable on this and it always seems like having credit makes getting a vehicle, a home, or others things. Basically I just want some extra input on whether I should be trying to build credit, and if a credit builder loan is a good place to start (my bank offers them).

personalfinance,Question about Raise allocation (28yo),"Hey All,

I (28M) have a question that I’m sure will get the “look at the directive” answer. But I would still like to chat it out. 

For reference, I am married with 2 kids, have a mortgaged SFH. 

I am about to switch to a different role and get a pay increase from 80k to 105k. Im torn between using that excess money to aggressively pay down SL or max 401k, then pay down student loans with small leftover. Which should I do? 

Details below:

Currently 80k Sal , I max HSA and get my company match of 6% for 401k.

EF fully funded

Have about 5k in Roth IRA

Have about 12k in 401k

Car Loan 35k @ 2.84% 600/mo

Private SL 36k @ 3.22% 384/mo

Fed SL 48k @ 4.94%(avg) 450/500mo (when resumed - pending any forgiveness)

I left out the income from my spouse, so nothing else will change aside from this increase. 

With the increase, if I maxed out my 401k I would be left with around 

$9700 net / year extra to throw towards the above. ($400 more a month + 2 extra paychecks of 2400 - moving from 24 pc to 26 pc) 

If I went the aggressive payment option leaving the lower 5% 401k and max has option in place , I would have 18k net / year ($1050 more a month + 2 extra paychecks of 2725 - moving from 24 pc to 26 pc - also adjusted slightly for taxes)

What path should we take? Thank you",finance,1656724339
personalfinance,Total engine failure --&gt; how do I go about getting the best deal on a new/used car? (SF Bay Area),"Hello reddit! I'm looking for any and all insight and advice when it comes to dealing with a dead car and best practices/considerations when thinking about getting a new car (buy new/used? lease? etc.). The last time I thought about buying a car was pre-Obama, so needless to say I have zero practice or experience - thanks in advance for reading and for your insights. I'm based in California, SF Bay Area for relevance.

**Question 1: How to deal with a car with total engine failure?**

Today my car suffered what a technician says is total engine failure. The car in question (2009 Toyota RAV4, \~150K miles) is physically in ""good"" condition (some wear and tear, a dented rear pannel), but of course, with a failed engine, it's maybe now considered a clunker? KBB value indicates it would probably be around \~6K trade in, and maybe upwards of \~9-10K for a private sale. But both prices likely require a working engine (duh), which the technician indicated could be 3-5K (maybe more)? 

A cursory Google search seems to indicate we might be able to sell it as a clunker for 1.5-2.5K (CarBrain quote)? And of course there is always donating it (I can't get the Kars4Kids song out of my head right now but don't want to support them) but I am not sure how that quite works (Do I get to write off KBB value? Or the clunker value?)

What is the best option here? I think at this point I would prefer ease over cost maximization.

**Part 2: I need a new car - what are the best options/tricks/advice financially?**

Unless repairing the car is far and away the better financial option, I will need a new car.  So now the question is - what is the best option financially? 

I want/need an SUV and am initially thinking something in the size/price range of a Toyota Highlander, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride. Not looking for recommendations, but rather financial advice on should I buy new? Buy used? Lease? I would really like to eventually get an all electric SUV (I commute \~70 miles to and from work each day) so part of me is wondering about leasing for a few years and then buying new once the EV inventory and options expand. But I know there are annual mileage requirements with leases and I would likely blow through it and unsure how much extra that might cost, on top of what I assume will be higher rates right now given Fed, interest rate hikes, etc.. So maybe buying (new? used) is better for me, but then the question is ""how do I go about getting the best deal"" at the dealership. Are online sites (Carvana, Carmax) better? 

I realize these two questions are likely topics that have been discussed before (and maybe many times before). So if there are previous posts you want to point me to, thank you!",finance,1656730493

CryptoCurrency,Cryptos are worse than the problem they are attempting to solve. It’s just Wall Street and all the greed theft and corruption repackaged for the average chump.,"First I’ll say I would love a technology to come along and replace the entrenched financial system of the fed and central banks and put the power of finance in the hands of the people BUT THIS IS NOT IT! 

If we are honest the crypto industry has become more greedy and corrupt than the system it seeks to replace. 

It’s become a space where everyone is looking to invest a few thousand $ and become millionaires and buy yachts and lambos without creating anything of value the average crypto bro is no better than a Wall Street trader ripping of pension funds and manipulating commodity markets. 

Crypto was supposed to be decentralised money run by the people for the people but it’s just become a shit show to rival anything seen in the traditional banking sector. 

I truly believe sentiment around crypto has changed for the average man in the street and it’s mainly viewed as a scam / Ponzi scheme rather than a “peoples money” alternative to traditional banking. 

I always wondered why the real motherfuckers behind the entrenched financial system didn’t try and shut it down ( 51% attacks paid for with unlimited printed money, regulations etc) but the truth is much simpler, they knew human nature and greed would do the job for them , look at the state of the crypto “industry “ now it’s reputation is in the gutter. 

It’s going to be a long hard road for this industry to clean itself up and be taken seriously as an alternative to traditional finance and that’s such a shame as the potential was there to provide a Sound money decentralised solution but it just looks like one big pump and dump Ponzi scheme all over right now.

Reckoning is coming for many of the scammers from the last 2 years including NFT grifters","US DoJ has filed a series of criminal prosecutions against crypto scammers in the past few days and weeks. All of them are being charged with wire fraud and money laundering, including NFT rug pull scammers who believed their shitty jpeg would be a good way to scam unsuspecting investors. Wire fraud and money laundering charges can bring criminals upto 20 years imprisonment. 

This is from 2 days ago, charges against 4 separate scams: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-enforcement-action-charging-six-individuals-cryptocurrency-fraud

&gt; The Department of Justice, together with federal law enforcement partners, today announced criminal charges against six defendants in four separate cases for their alleged involvement in cryptocurrency-related fraud, including the largest known Non-Fungible Token (NFT) scheme charged to date, a fraudulent investment fund that purportedly traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, a global Ponzi scheme involving the sale of unregistered crypto securities, and a fraudulent initial coin offering.  

As law enforcement ramps up their crypto investigation departments, expect more and more such crimes to be brought to book. The ""baller ape"" NFT scam indictment alleges the criminals used chain-hop, onchain swaps and other onchain laundering methods to scam victims.

https://www.justice.gov/criminal-vns/case/file/1516756/download

The DOJ has set up a separate webpage for victims in crypto scams to come forward and submit victim impact statements:

&gt; All investor victims of the Baller Ape Club, EmpiresX, TBIS, and Circle Society schemes are encouraged to visit the webpage https://www.justice.gov/criminal-vns/crypto-enforcement to identify themselves as potential victims and obtain more information on their rights as victims, including the ability to submit a victim impact statement.

vet,my cat is not well,"I'm in a difficult predicament, no idea what to do.

Six months ago I got my cat, Kori, and she had an issue. She couldn't meow, she only mare a very weird noise that sounds like 'crjk'. I was fine with it, didn't care.

But then she began stumbling and finding difficulty moving and it only got worse. I took her to many vets multiple times, but nothing is working with her. They say it's most likely a nerve disease, and I've tried giving her the recommend medicine but nothing. 

She can't walk, only flip flops around, but she feels pain in her limbs normally and can kick and move if you lift her up. She just can't stand on them.


That was it up until yesterday, she vomited. I fed her, but she kept rejecting the food so I kept just trying to gently push it into her mouth until she would swallow it as it's very hard for her to eat properly normally. But then she vomited white foam again with bits of the food, she has been vomiting up until this morning. About more than four times and it's been 13 hours. She won't stop flopping and squirming around and hits me whenever I come near her. Her littering is normal, no diarrhea or anything. I am going insane.

I have tried reaching out to shelters but in my country they're just 'there' but never respond at all. I don't know what I can do for her, since vets are getting very expensive. I might just end up taking her to one but is there anything I can do until then?

Why are S&amp;P earnings estimated to grow 8% from 2021 -&gt; 2022, and 6.66% 2022 -&gt; 2023? If markets are forward looking... why does it feel like there's still a bit of wiggle room for future earnings estimates to be adjusted downwards? Why are markets being optimistic instead of pessimistic?

btc,Reasons bitcoin had its worst quarter in more than a decade,"The world`s largest cryptocurrency lost about 58% of value in the second quarter of 2022 with other promising cryptos like Concordium, Axie Inifinity and the likes also being affected.  Here are some flashpoints that hit the cryptocurrency industry last quarter. 
 
The stock sell-off has weighed on bitcoin and the crypto market as investors dump risky assets.  The first major episode last quarter was the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and sister token luna which sent shockwaves through the industry. 
 
A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency usually pegged to a real-world asset.  The episode reverberated through the industry and had knock-on effects, most notably on cryptocurrency hedge funds Three Arrows Capital, which had exposure to terraUSD (more on this below. ) Crypto lender Celsius paused withdrawals for customers in June.  The company offered users yields of more than 18% if they deposit cryptocurrency with Celsius. 
 It then lent that money to players in the crypto market who were willing to pay a high interest rate to borrow the money.  Celsius cited ""extreme market conditions"" as the reason for pausing withdrawals.  The issues with Celsius exposed the weakness in many of the lending models used in the cryptocurrency industry that offered users high yields.  Three Arrows Capital is one of the most prominent hedge funds focused on cryptocurrency investments. 
 3AC had exposure to the collapsed algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and sister token luna.  The Financial Times reported last month that U. S. -based crypto lenders BlockFi and Genesis liquidated some of 3AC's positions, citing people familiar with the matter. 
 
Cryptocurrency exchange CoinFlex halted customer withdrawals last month, citing ""extreme market conditions"" and a customers account that went into negative equity.  CoinFlex claimed that the customer, whom it alleges is high-profile crypto investor Roger Ver, owes the company $47 million.  Ver, who has the nickname ""Bitcoin Jesus"" for his evangelical views of the industry in its early days, denies that he owes CoinFlex money.  CoinFlex issued a new token called Recovery Value USD, or rvUSD, to raise the $47 million so it can resume withdrawals, and is offering a 20% interest rate for investors willing to buy and hold the digital coin. CoinFlex is also looking to recoup the funds from Ver.",cryptocurrency,1656777979

Background- wife and I combine for 170k yearly, just graduated. Owe \~200k in combined undergrad and grad student loans which are on hold until August- average 5.5% interest rate . Excellent job security in healthcare, anticipate annual salary growth to 180-185k in September at our first year reviews. While student loans have been frozen, we have been working to max IRAs and 401k.

Quote 1:  total of $30,000 for 4.5 kWh system with EV charger install. Deposit of $1,000, 0% interest loan over 12 years. We would receive 26% tax return next April as part of federal incentive. We would not need to apply this 26% return to the principal of the loan, we would simply put this into index funds in one way or another.

Quote 2: total of $16000 for 3.7 kWH system with eV charger install (4.5 kWh from the other company is their minimum). This would be paid in cash up front. We would  receive the 26% tax return next April. 

At face value, there's a pretty huge discrepancy between the two quotes obviously with the total cost- however the interest free loan aspect, paired with the 26% tax credit and the ability to simply re-invest that tax credit next April muddies the water for me. I'd greatly appreciate any advice backed by math :)",finance,1656781405

vet,"Cat has irritated bottom area, worried about infection.","I adopted my cat Mimi about three years ago. She is a senior cat around 11 years old. And when I adopted her she was extremely overweight, about 20-21lbs. 

(I believe whoever had her before fed her people food because she has to beg for food like a dog when I first got her, I never gave him so she doesn’t do it anymore.)

Since I adopted her though she’s lost almost 3 pounds which is good. So the problem lies with the fact that since she’s so large she cannot reach her bottom area to clean herself. I wipe her bottom daily and the vet I used to go to prescribed an ointment that I would put on there for her. I unfortunately had to go away for a few weeks recently and the friend I had taken care of her did not keep up with her bottom I believe even once.
When I got her back her bottom was caked in feces matted, but the most concerning to me was that around what I believe might be her vaginal area looks extremely red and irritated. She is licking herself constantly and I can tell she’s frustrated and in pain. Other than that she doesn’t have any symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, or fatigue. She still eats and drinks normally. But I can just tell she’s in pain.

I live in Duluth Minnesota and here all the vet offices are booked out for months. The one emergency vet that we have is over in Wisconsin, and their fee just to have her seen is about $250 which is beyond what I can afford at this time as I just paid my rent yesterday and won’t have anymore income for two more weeks. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice on what I can do at home to keep her clean and comfortable. Or if anyone has any recommendations for an online vet service who would be able to prescribe the bottom appointment for her since I’m sure I can’t get it over the counter.

She is my baby and I’m just worried sick about her.

defi,Interest Protocol | Free Stablecoin Interest Rate Loans | Use LP tokens as collateral | Whitelist open,"# Interest Protocol - ETH and BNBChain

**Competitive Advantage:**

1.  Stablecoin zero-interest rate loans ***(Free)***

2.  Support many tokens such Shiba Inu and Apecoin

3.  Support interest bearing tokens and LP tokens as collateral

4.  It allows you to create your own lending market

5.  Farm the collateral while borrowing

6.  Stake native token

7.  DEX that swaps with low slippage cost

**Borrow and lend**

Interest Protocol is a lending protocol that is unique for its features. It allows users to use myriad of tokens as collateral to borrow other tokens.

\---&gt; *For example holders of Interest Bearing tokens such as Venus USDC (* [*https://www.coinbase.com/price/venus-usdc*](https://www.coinbase.com/price/venus-usdc)*) can use their token to borrow bitcoin or interest protocol stablecoin.*

In case the users decide to borrow their stablecoin, Dinero, their loan will have a zero interest-rate cost, which makes their loan a net positive loan. If you borrow $1000 you pay no interest-rate while your collateral will be farmed. BIG WIN to all.

Users can also use their LP tokens such as USDC-ETH for example as collateral to borrow any other token while making money from their collateral.

Another advantage is that they invest the collateral on Venus, PancakeSwap and Compound. For instance if you deposit ETH as collateral to borrow BTC, they will farm your ETH on Compound.

Interest Protocol also allows users to create their own lending market but how? :

**Create your own lending market with 4 pre-defined tokens and 1 token of your choice**

""According with them:

This new lending market consists of multiple separate smaller markets. Each small market has 5 tokens. Four of them are the same in all markets (USDC, USDT, WETH, and BTC). We call these bridge tokens because they can be used to borrow and lend across markets, thus unifying all the small markets into one large market. The 5th token in a MAIL market is called the risky token and is every other coin that is not one of the bridge tokens.

*""Why did we build this?*

Lending markets such as Compound and AAVE are one of the building blocks of DeFi and have been a great success. However, they are built around a single pool which forces them to have very strict listing conditions. As a result, on average, the majority of lending protocols have an average of 30 tokens.

Our MAIL markets allow any token holder to have access to money markets. This was accomplished by moving from a mono pool architecture to a multiple pool architecture. ""

The time to look for good projects is now while the market is being corrected. I am glad that I found this project that I am now sharing with you. I heard they are looking for seed funding and then will do the token sale with the contracts fully audited. They also have a very detailed documentation.

Attention that this not a pump and dump project. I am just sharing with you because it has so much potential and the team seems to be working day and night to make it happen. I will not tell that the project is perfect but there is something there because they already deployed a test net on BNB Chain and now they just deployed their test net on ETH which allows users to do something unique which is to create their own lending market like Aave and Compound but all in one unique DApp.

FIRE-mindset wondering if the benefits gained in this job outweigh the lost income. Moderate COL, very little (student loan) debt and I max out both Roth and 401(k) each year.

So, the planets aligned and I got a job offer with the federal agency I've been chasing since first starting out in college.  Great location compared to where I'm at now, cool facility, and obviously super stable work and lots of lateral trajectory once I get locked into the federal system. The posting was a GS 7/9 ladder and they offered me GS-09 at Step 1. My education and work experience make me eligible for GS-11, but I would need to settle for GS-09 for now and move to a new position in a few years, which I'm ok with.

The only downside is it's an (initial) paycut of approximately $15k. I just got a pay bump after changing companies, but I'm already working well over 40 hours per week. The federal job would be much slower pace and consistent hours. On top of that, obviously the benefits are much better in the federal job. I'd have top notch health insurance, a pension, access to the federal TSP, etc.  My over-arching goal would be early retirement in approximately 25-30 years, so having those benefits for life would be massive.

Everyone around me (in industry) is telling me to stay put and cash in while I can, but the position I've been offered is super competitive, and the benefits of getting into the federal system compound the longer you're in it. If I plan to be there for another 25-30 years, I'd be stupid to turn this down, right?

I had already did some research and just had some prior knowledge about credit and financing a car, and all the stuff he said was exactly what I had heard from anyone else, just pay on time and all that until you can refinance. 

But the one thing he said was don’t apply for any credit cards until you’ve made about 4-6 on time payments. I was under the impression that if I spread out my credit usage and got a credit card right now, just a secured one, that it would be better for my boosting my credit faster.

retirement,are there better bond ETFs out there?,"Following a post by u/NoMoRatRace ... looking for advice on whether these newer bond ETFs might be useful (copied from WSJ July 3)

**Bond ETFs Attract New Investors With Narrower Offerings**

This wouldn’t seem to be the best of times for exchange-traded funds that focus on fixed income. A resurgence of inflation not seen in 40 years has put upward pressure on interest rates, which, in turn, has sent prices of bonds and bond funds tumbling.

Yet new investment in fixed-income ETFs continues apace.

Why? Like their cousins for stocks, ETFs that trade in bond and credit markets have become more granular over the years. And that specialization, some investment-industry experts say, offers investors the opportunity to focus on fixed-income investments that can stand out in this market.

The increased variation in fixed-income ETFs is something “that we welcome,” says Shannon Sacoccia, chief investment officer of SVB Private, a unit of Silicon Valley Bank. ETFs that are targeted to specific exposures, she says, make more sense than trying to chase down individual bonds.

Investors have poured nearly $500 billion into U.S.-listed bond ETFs since the end of 2019, closing June with nearly $1.2 trillion in assets under management, according to research firm CFRA. Strong investor demand helped lead asset managers to launch 163 new products over the same time frame. 

By trading throughout the day on stock exchanges, bond and other fixed-income ETFs also give fund investors the ability to build low-cost fixed-income portfolios that can be adjusted in real time, as opposed to investing in individual bonds or bond mutual funds that might have trading minimums and other limits.

Trying to counter potential volatility in fixed income by relying heavily on cash, money-market funds or short-term Treasury funds, as many investors have done in recent years, earned little interest. And those who stuck with broad-based funds, such as those targeting the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, were gradually taking on interest rate risk as the index filled up with longer maturity bonds with greater exposure to losses if rates started to rise.

“Investors are looking for tools to disaggregate ‘the Agg,’ ” says Stephen Laipply, U.S. head of iShares Fixed Income ETFs for BlackRock. “With ETFs targeting credit quality or maturity, they have the ability to build fixed-income ETF portfolios that are a lot more precise.”

Bond ETFs have had plenty of flavors for years, including broad-based index funds and actively managed funds; municipal- and corporate-bond funds; funds that bought investment-grade or high-yield (junk) bonds; and funds that offered maturities across the board, ranging from a few months to several decades.

Recent launches have taken that specificity even further, including funds targeting high-yield sectors, the movement of the yield curve and the outlook for inflation. For instance, launched in May 2021, the $302 million Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (PFIX) holds cash, Treasury securities, and derivatives that gain when long-term rate expectations rise. The fund’s price this year has gained 50.4% through June, according to CFRA, as the Federal Open Market Committee has committed to interest-rate increases to combat inflation.

New issuer BondBloxx is tackling demand for high-yield sectors and narrower credit risks (Would you like BB or CCC?), compared with existing offerings that invest in broader high-yield indexes.

It isn’t just new offerings that are gaining traction in the expanding fixed-income area. The $6.7 billion WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR), which launched in February 2014, has had nearly 70% of its assets arrive since the beginning of the year. The ETF, which holds short-term, floating-rate Treasury notes, is up 0.5% this year, according to CFRA, and currently yields 1.64%, according to WisdomTree Investments. By comparison, SPDR Portfolio Short Term Treasury ETF (SPTS), holding fixed-rate short-term Treasury notes, is down 3%, according to CFRA, and now yields 1.49%, according to State Street Global Advisors.

ETFs that trade in floating-rate investments, by their nature, are less sensitive to rate movements than many fixed-income investments. Other floating-rate options attracting investors include products holding senior loans or pools of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA), for example, has had 73% of its $1.4 billion in assets arrive this year. It’s down 2.2% this year, according to CFRA. Investor interest is linked to the fact that the yield of the underlying loans will rise with interest-rate increases.

Still, one potential drawback to narrower segments in the fixed-income ETF market is that because ETFs trade throughout the day, prices for ETFs invested in riskier or more rate-sensitive credits can move faster than the net asset value of the underlying bonds during periods of high volatility. As a result, when that daily net asset value is calculated, the market price for the ETF may indicate a higher or lower value than the NAV. That resulting premium (or discount) can subtract from or add to returns as markets settle.

Take the recently launched BondBloxx USD High Yield Bond Energy Sector ETF (XHYE). On June 13, the fund traded at a 2% discount to NAV, whereas the broader-based iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (CLP) traded at a 1.2% discount that same day. Deeper discounts attract arbitragers known as market makers to buy the ETF and sell the underlying bonds, thereby narrowing the pricing discrepancy.

Chasing yield in the current fixed-income market can also lead to peril. Longer-term Treasury funds, such as the $20.2 billion iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and the $5.8 billion SPDR Portfolio Long Term Treasury ETF (SPTL), have seen more than a quarter of their current assets arrive this year, according to CFRA. But funds such as these are particularly exposed to losses each time the Fed pushes rates higher.",finance,1656873008

investing,Do interest rate cuts tend to lead to bull or bear markets?,"I’ve seen conflicting info. Links in the text

For example, Patrick Boyle [presented](https://youtu.be/0jxoVSUSHg0) [skip to 15:30] very convincing and sourced information that shows that an investor investing money at the beginning of the interest rate cut will do much better in terms of equity returns than during interest rate hikes (in the US) and the in the UK all off the equity premium was earned during interest rate cuts only. This is very convincing information based on study looking at a 130 year period in the Uk and USA

On the other hand I’ve seen often quoted stat, as below in the link presented by day trading YouTube channel “FX Evolution” (unfortunately unsourced) that the previous [5 out of 7 times](https://youtu.be/eXuXiTdr6vM) [skip to 11:30] the Fed has cut the rates this has lead to a recession - in fact it is cutting after the hikes which is the most dangerous part. Unfortunately there’s no good source of this information, except for a video like above of articles mentioning that previous hike and cut cycles have led to bad results, however I have not across well researched articles on this. I was not able to find anything useful further online. 

Although it is not strictly contradictory - positive equity returns can happen during recessions like during Covid, I don’t think that’s the norm. And if recessions commonly happened during rate cuts there would probably not be a such a noticeable positive equity return as the market tend to fall during recessions. 

So which one of these is true? Do interest rate cuts tend to lead recessions/bear markets or economic booms/bull markets?

**Bond ETFs Attract New Investors With Narrower Offerings**

This wouldn’t seem to be the best of times for exchange-traded funds that focus on fixed income. A resurgence of inflation not seen in 40 years has put upward pressure on interest rates, which, in turn, has sent prices of bonds and bond funds tumbling.

Yet new investment in fixed-income ETFs continues apace.

Why? Like their cousins for stocks, ETFs that trade in bond and credit markets have become more granular over the years. And that specialization, some investment-industry experts say, offers investors the opportunity to focus on fixed-income investments that can stand out in this market.

The increased variation in fixed-income ETFs is something “that we welcome,” says Shannon Sacoccia, chief investment officer of SVB Private, a unit of Silicon Valley Bank. ETFs that are targeted to specific exposures, she says, make more sense than trying to chase down individual bonds.

Investors have poured nearly $500 billion into U.S.-listed bond ETFs since the end of 2019, closing June with nearly $1.2 trillion in assets under management, according to research firm CFRA. Strong investor demand helped lead asset managers to launch 163 new products over the same time frame.

By trading throughout the day on stock exchanges, bond and other fixed-income ETFs also give fund investors the ability to build low-cost fixed-income portfolios that can be adjusted in real time, as opposed to investing in individual bonds or bond mutual funds that might have trading minimums and other limits.

Trying to counter potential volatility in fixed income by relying heavily on cash, money-market funds or short-term Treasury funds, as many investors have done in recent years, earned little interest. And those who stuck with broad-based funds, such as those targeting the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, were gradually taking on interest rate risk as the index filled up with longer maturity bonds with greater exposure to losses if rates started to rise.

“Investors are looking for tools to disaggregate ‘the Agg,’ ” says Stephen Laipply, U.S. head of iShares Fixed Income ETFs for BlackRock. “With ETFs targeting credit quality or maturity, they have the ability to build fixed-income ETF portfolios that are a lot more precise.”

Bond ETFs have had plenty of flavors for years, including broad-based index funds and actively managed funds; municipal- and corporate-bond funds; funds that bought investment-grade or high-yield (junk) bonds; and funds that offered maturities across the board, ranging from a few months to several decades.

Recent launches have taken that specificity even further, including funds targeting high-yield sectors, the movement of the yield curve and the outlook for inflation. For instance, launched in May 2021, the $302 million Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (PFIX) holds cash, Treasury securities, and derivatives that gain when long-term rate expectations rise. The fund’s price this year has gained 50.4% through June, according to CFRA, as the Federal Open Market Committee has committed to interest-rate increases to combat inflation.

CryptoMarkets,Crypto market crash: will it follow the same path as stock markets?,"As someone working in tech, I like to explore and learn. In my view, Reddit and LinkedIn are pretty useful sources when it comes to online platforms.

Okay, so times are tough. Fuel prices are rising through the roof, and the recession is at an all-time high. Some industries are crippling in front of our eyes. Others are barely managing to survive.

Now we've become quite intrigued with the power of bitcoin. A lot of us have invested in it and gotten good results.  In recent times, investing in crypto has been a regret for many.

## Difference between stocks vs. bitcoin

For stocks, you need to open an account in a brokerage. The brokerage carries out transactions in the client’s name. Plus, you have to submit personal details to the brokerage.

A crypto owner maintains an anonymous identity. You can store your assets on a device or a digital wallet. 

* Stock exchange payments are more secure when compared with crypto
* Crypto is more volatile; hence the investor has to be careful
* The system of stocks exchange is older, which means more regulations 
* With crypto, you can win much more significant rewards but lose a lot to

## Why is crypto falling today?

According to conversation.com,  in November 2021, the overall value of the cryptocurrency market was close to US$3 trillion. No one expected that in a matter of a few months, things would transform to such a drastic extent. Inflation in the US has been the highest in the last 40 years.

Pew Research states that 16% of US individuals say that they have invested in crypto. Why am I mentioning all these stats? Over the past year, crypto has surprised all. With rising fuel costs and inflation, the environment has become pretty unfavorable for investing. 

The conditions of the world right now - the war in Ukraine and slowed growth in China have added to the pressures investors face. Hence, before buying cryptocurrency, always ask yourself, how much crypto can I afford to lose?

## Pros &amp; cons of crypto

* Crypto has the potential for significant gains, which excites investors. 
* At the start, there were limited options, but now there is a variety to choose from
* It is a more transparent and fairer alternative to traditional banking.

Cons

* There can be a lack of security when compared with stocks
* The bitcoin and crypto markets can be volatile, sometimes making investors hesitant.
* Compared to stocks, bitcoin is still relatively new.

## The million-dollar question

Will crypto take on the same fate as stocks? In my view, crypto is still relatively new. There needs to be a global framework to control the volatility of bitcoin. 

Due to the drop in its valuation, bitcoin has been one of the factors that have triggered a recession. Stocks fell in the first week of May.  Crypto is following 

the same pattern as tech stocks. Both are evolving to create a new form of the digital economy.

There was a time when crypto provided investors with the break they needed from stocks. In my view, this has changed now. There are a few reasons for this. I had to research a bit, go through Forbes articles, skim through Google searches and check Investopedia to come up with these. Not to forget, read some pdf reports and quora answers.  Anyway, let's get back to the reasons.

* The most extensive observation is that many factors that affect crypto also impact stocks.
* Monetary policies, regulations, and economic conditions have similar effects on both.
* The ability of stocks to grow depends on the company's level of growth. For crypto, prices are backed by trends.
* Bitcoin’s price movement has closely mirrored that of the Nasdaq. (New York times)
* Just like the stock market, Bitcoin recently reacted negatively to plans from the U.S. Federal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet and raise interest rates.
* Investors are considering resorting to gold rather than stocks and crypto due to uncertain changes.",cryptocurrency,1656881041

She was very close to having her car repossessed, but came up with a large payment to avoid repossession.  She is now on a payment plan, but it is not the original plan.  She had an auto loan with Bank of America and it is now in a Bank of America recovery department.  I am not clear about whether or not the loan has been written off.  It is not with a 3rd party debt collection agency.  The new plan is that she is making automatic payments in the same amount as her original loan through November, but then a new arrangement must be made.  The interest rate has been dropped to 1% and there are no more late fees.  I was with her when she set this up.  It sounded legit.  I got the impression that this is a last resort step taken by Bank of America that allows them to be paid without turning it over to a collection agency for pennies on the dollar.  The person she spoke with mentioned that if there is a settlement, the difference would be treated as income and she would receive a 1099.

Is this something that anyone is familiar with?  

She also has other debts that have actually gone to 3rd party debt collectors.  She feels responsible for her debts but I think it would be best for her to try to settle them for lesser amounts.  Would it be wise for me to try to convince her to settle these rather than pay in full?

economy,Rejection and irritation,"The blackmailing by Moscow with a nuclear war no longer frightens world leaders as much as causes deep irritation. Russia's small and victorious special military operation in Ukraine has stalled. The Kremlin is still capable of using tactical nuclear weapons in the battle space, however, today no one doubts that this will cause a very harsh reaction from the anti-war coalition of the West and its allies. Russia has forced the world democratic community to choose: either the Russian Federation will endlessly threaten everyone with a nuclear war and violate any treaties, norms and rules, or the Russian Federation will stumble upon tough opposition from the civilized community. Therefore, the West has no other choice but to help Ukraine.

Right after February 24, French President E. Macron, German Chancellor O. Scholz, NATO Secretary General J. Stoltenberg and some others surprised with their excessive caution and utmost diplomacy in relation to V. Putin personally and the totalitarian state he built. In general, this was a continuation of the policy of ex-Chancellor of Germany A. Merkel. Back in 2014, she said that it was impossible to talk with V. Putin, since he was in some kind of alternative reality, but, nevertheless, she consistently pursued the policy of appeasing the aggressor. However, things have now changed!

The Russian army has been waging war in Ukraine for more than four months and carrying out genocide of the local population, and the Russians are telling the whole world and themselves that they are conducting a humanitarian operation to save Ukrainians from Nazism. And now, the world leaders, apparently, finally refused to play along with this schizophrenic performance of the Russians.

At the NATO summit, a new strategic concept was adopted, where the Russian Federation was declared problem No.1. Against the background of the neo-imperialist policy of the Kremlin, Sweden and Finland were invited to the Alliance. US President John Biden announced an increase in the NATO *Response Force* in Europe up to 300,000 people. From the side of the Alliance, the Ramstein Coalition and the United States, Kyiv was promised an increase in the supply of weapons and general support. The President of Kazakhstan, K. Tokayev, started a trade war with the Russian Federation, having behind him the unofficial support of China and Turkey. The Indonesian government has officially denied the Kremlin invitation to V. Putin to the country for the G-20 summit.

No less impressive is the clearly declared personal rejection of representatives of the Russian government by Western politicians. For example, British Prime Minister B. Johnson speaks of V. Putin's ""toxic masculinity"". British Minister of Defense B. Wallace declares that V. Putin's view of himself and the world is a syndrome of a small person, a macho look. German diplomat, head of the Munich Security Conference K. Heusgen calls ex-president of the Russian Federation D. Medvedev a “clown” after his insane posts on social networks. In general, the “personalizing” on the part of Western political elites indicates the onset of complete disregard for the Russian leadership and the desire to “leave them behind brackets”.",finance,1656913237

personalfinance,Question about Mortgage Rate s,"I've never owned a home so please forgive my lack of knowledge on this matter. I just really need to help my parents. They've made a lot of poor financial decisions. 

My parents are 62 (dad) and 64 (mom). Dad stopped working and is about to draw SS. Mom is still working and making appx 66k per year. They owe appx $96,000 on their house which is currently valued at $270,000 (zillow estimate). Mom carries an approximate additionally debt of 20k in credit cards and student loans. The mortgage they currently have is in an ARM that is currently at an 8.8% interest rate, the maturity date of the mortgage is 2034. They bought the house in '92 and refinanced in '04.  Currently monthly payments are appx $1600ish.

My question is, what is the smartest move for them to get it paid off in the most expedient way possible? Their mortgage statement says there is not a prepayment penalty so I am going to suggest to my mom that she start making extra payments with a previous employers work pension she is eligible to draw on. Is refinancing into fixed interest rate even possible if they only have 10 years left on the current mortgage? What is the smartest strategies in this situation?",finance,1656949807

personalfinance,Trying to decide if I can bite the bullet and move out based on my salary and the rental market.,"I (26F) have been living with my parents in my hometown while I attend law school. I'm trying to decide if my intense desire to finally move out within a year is shortsighted. 

Here's the breakdown: 

\- No car payment 

\- No undergrad debt

\- No credit card debt

\- \~$5k saved up but have been dipping into it for bar exam things so I'm scared to look at it rn (prep course, application fees, hotel, etc.)

\- Job starting in September w gross salary of $71,000 with no upward mobility for several years. 

\- \~$60,000 in federal student loans for law school, repayment starts in December, planning on getting myself on track for public service loan forgiveness, hoping to be able to arrange reasonable monthly payments because my income is relatively low for my field. Crossing my fingers for something between $200-400/mo. Need to look into that more. 

\- Rental prices are on the rise in my suburban/military area. It's been looking like $1,400-1,500+/mo for a 1-2 bedroom apartment before utilities. I am open to finding a roommate as well. I'm thinking it will be necessary, actually. It freaks me out that I could potentially be spending half my salary on rent but I guess that is normal? 

My plan right now is to stay at home for now and save as much as possible and move out sometime next year. 

At the end of the day, I just want to gtfo and if that means I'm poor, so be it. But are there any glaring red flags to my situation that scream ""stay at home as long as possible""? Any amount in savings I should aim for before moving out? I've really looking forward to moving out but rent prices, gas prices, and inflation are making me second guess things.",finance,1656952388

stocks,Traditional “Value” Stocks are arguably some of the most unsafe picks in a rising interest rate environment,"Title. I’ve seen too many people in here flood into traditionally “safe” companies as they have weathered the recent volatility. I’m here to tell you that the risk/reward on these companies is terrible, and even under optimistic assumptions you are guaranteeing subpar returns. I’m specifically talking about the value stocks that trade close to a 25-30 PE, like $KO, $PG, etc.

Hypothetically, if there was a company that was absolutely, 100% guaranteed to have the exact same net income every year for the next decade, and every investor knew this, this investment would trade extremely close to long term yields, or the risk free rate. Obviously a company like this doesn’t exist, but there are several companies that have consistent net income, even during bad times, although almost no revenue growth. 

A great example is $KO. Coke trades currently at a 27 PE, and even with inflation their earnings have been flat over the past decade. It is very likely you will see flat earnings over the next decade as well. At a 27 PE and almost flat net income, you should expect a little less than a 4% return on your money, as the company can buy back a little under 4% of its shares or issue close to a 4% dividend. This makes sense, as the risk free rate now is around 3%, meaning your making 1% more, for a little more risk. 

The issue is when these yields rise. With inflation running hot, it is likely that these yields will only get higher for the foreseeable future. If yields start paying 4%, it becomes ridiculous to take any risk of lower net income with $KO, meaning massive compression in its P/E. Where this settles is impossible to tell though. At a 20 P/E, almost a 30% drop from here, you would only get a 5% return while taking risk, is this worth it when the risk free rate is 4%? This means a 100 BPS move in yields could easily drop $KO and other traditional value plays 30-40%, and this assumes yields top out at 4%. The risk is obviously still there with any growth companies, but I’d argue it’s less for them after the already big drops.",finance,1656953696

However we are needing to pull out of this purchase due to things beyond our control (vendor hid significant upcoming major works from us) so we found a new place and had an offer accepted at 370k.

I went to Halifax today to let them know that we would still like to borrow **the same amount** (300k) but would just like to transfer the offer to another address. They have come back and said that due to this they will need to use the current interest rates which are now EXTORTIONATE and would therefore need to bump our repayments up to £1224pcm. We cannot afford this and feel totally disappointed that we cannot now afford the property.

Does anyone have experience in this? Why can they not keep the same rate we agreed upon, if we are simply changing address and borrowing same amount? I am going to go back and argue this but wanted to come to reddit first to discuss.

stocks,Sprouts Farmers Market - Can a boring company can be a good investment? $SFM,"**Sprouts Farmers Market ($SFM)** is quite a boring company. However, boring companies can turn out to be great investments. Is SFM one of them? 

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals and provide insights into the business fundamentals, financials as well as valuation. Feel free to disagree with the analysis and share your views.

***Let's get started!***

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Sprouts Farmers Market?**

In a nutshell, it is a grocery store chain featuring an open layout with fresh produce at its heart. The company sources the produce locally which makes it less exposed to certain global supply chain issues. One of the components of its business model is its distribution centers. The produce from the local farmers initially goes to these centers and then is delivered to the individual stores. They aim to have one within a 250-mile (400 kilometers) radius of all of their stores. Currently, that's the case for 85% of their stores. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How does a grocery store chain grow?**

I always try to simplify the way companies bring revenue in. In this case, the revenue would be equal to the # of stores multiplied by the ARPS (Average revenue per store), plus the eCommerce sales (currently 10% of the total revenue).

Let's start with the number of stores. This number grew from **285 at the end of 2017** to **374 at the end of 2021**. This net increase of almost 90 stores is outstanding, especially if we take into account that they've closed only 3 stores during the last 5 years. The company is doing a great job choosing good locations. As the growth depends hugely on the success of opening and operating new stores, this is a positive indicator.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the available numbers, the revenue per store is flat for the last 5 years (a bit over $16m/store).  However, this can be a bit misleading, especially since the company is focused on decreasing the store size from 30k square feet (2.8k square meters) to 23k square feet (2.15k square meters). Smaller stores would require a lower initial investment and come with lower operating costs. Hence, we cannot make any conclusion on the information that the average revenue per store is flat over a 5-years period.

&amp;#x200B;

**Key financial and operating points**

* The revenue has increased from **$4.7b in 2017** to **$6.1b in 2021**, an almost 7% average annual increase. During the same period,  the gross margin increased from **34%** to **36%,** and the operating margin from **4.8%** to **5.5%.** The industry is known for having low margins, so we cannot forecast a substantial increase in this area. The management is aiming for a 6% operating margin, which is not far from the current level.
* What I personally find very interesting about the company is the development and improvements around their inventory management. The inventory turnover has improved from 13.5x to 14.7x and the average inventory per store has decreased from $0.81m to $0.71m (let's not forget, the average revenue/store remained flat).
* It is worth mentioning that roughly 16% of the company's revenue comes from their private label offering (Sprouts branded products). These products allow them to charge less to the final customer, yet the margins are either same or higher.
* Since 2015, 52m shares have been repurchased ($1.2b) leading to a 34% reduction of shares outstanding. The management has almost $600m remaining in the authorized repurchase program.
* As of Q1/2022, the company had $300m in cash, $250m in long-term debt, and $1.3m in capital leases.

**What's ahead of the company?**

The management is forecasting revenue growth of around 4% for 2022 but is aiming to grow the number of stores by 10% as of 2023. This is a big target, which means roughly 40 new stores are to be opened in 2023.

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value. The assumptions are listed below:

**Revenue growth:** 4% for the next 12 months, followed by 6% in the 4 years after that and declining over time to 3.16%.

**Operating margin**: To remain at the current level of 5.5%. The management is aiming for 6%, but they're not there yet. Could they reach that level? Absolutely! However, I am always using assumptions that the company can deliver with high probability. I'd rather be conservative than too optimistic and lose money.

**Discount rate**: Currently 4.84% (based on WACC - which is way too low due to its low beta), increasing to 10.9% over time (also due to the fact that the FED is raising the interest rate)

**Outcome**: $22.90 (Current share price $25.72)

\*Note: In the DCF calculation, the outstanding equity options are also taken into account.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions stated above, the revenue will grow by 62% to $10b in the next 10 years and the operating margin remains at 5.5%.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) changes based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Op. margin|5.0%|5.5%|6.0%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|40% ($8.6b)|$18.5|$21.1|$23.8|
|62% ($10.0b)|$19.9|$22.9|$25.9|
|100% ($12.4b)|$22.3|$26.0|$29.6|
|130% ($14.2b)|$24.1|$28.3|$32.4|

Looking at the company's performance, I do like how it is evolving. It is growing through opening new stores and not through acquisitions, which makes it less risky as they're copying what is proven to be working. The inventory management has improved and the margins are looking great. Although I do not have a position in the company, I'll definitely consider opening one if the price drops below $20/share.

CryptoCurrency,Take a look at the upcoming big macro events that will influence the directions of the market. July is gonna have a ton of big moves.,"With cryptos big correlation to the stock market crypto is getting heavily influenced by macro events to choose the upcoming direction. Obviously we can't really predict what's gonna in the world next but there indeed some major events scheduled on July where we know that they will dictate the direction.

1. On July 13th we are gonna get the Inflation CPI numbers from the US and as we have seen the last time they were over mostly over predictions and actually increased in the midst of rate hikes, so markets tanked heavily. Right now they are expected to be about 8.5%, anything above that will be deadly for markets


2. From July 26 to 27 we are gonna have the monthly FOMC meeting, there won't be any rate hike suprises here but we should expect some big statements about the upcoming moves the FED and how they adjust their targets as 2.5% or 3.5% won't be enough in any way.


3. The by far biggest event is the Q2 GDP estimates on July 28th. After the confirmation that Q1 was even -1.6% to the estimated - 1.5% and the predicted  +1.1% we are only one GDP negative quarter away from a recession that so many in the US are denying. Even the consens of Atlanta FED is predicting a massive - 2.5% quarter. If we get even half of that it would be mayhem in the markets.",cryptocurrency,1656965728
personalfinance,Financial Advice for Upcoming First Year Medical Student,"Hello, I am going to be a medical student in the fall, and I am getting a bit stressed out on my upcoming financial situation. I know about White Coat Investor and will be taking a look at that soon, but I also had some general questions I was hoping someone could advise me on. Before my questions though, I want to provide some background information about me.

I'm currently 24, have around 45k in savings, no current student loans from undergrad or credit card debt. Credit Score is around 750. No current financial investments (stock market, retirement funds, property). During medical school, I might continue to do online tutoring, however the income from this isn't entirely stable. I would say I average about $27/hr and maybe only do 3-6 hours a week.

1) Taking out Loans - Should I be wary of taking out loans? The school estimates about 73k in cost of attendance each year (32k tuition, 41k other expenses), and I have a merit scholarship of about 18k a year. The school is offering 40k federal unsub loans (6.54% fixed interest), and 15k federal grad plus loans (7.54% fixed interest). If I do not take out loans, I could use my savings to pay off as many expenses as aggressively as possible/do my best to live frugally to shave off what I can from the 41k they estimate for living expenses). I could also potentially ask my parents for help financially, but would prefer not to rely on that if possible.  
2) Investments in Retirement Funds - I know one of the easiest (and most beneficial) investments to make is Roth IRA. I've read that just a few years investing in a Roth IRA can compound to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in the future. As a result, I was wondering if I should invest in a Roth IRA while I am in medical school. I know that the yearly limit is around 5.5k - 6k but is further limited by your yearly income. With my tutoring job, I'm not positive I will make 5.5k-6k in a year, but should I put all my earnings into a Roth IRA? I am also okay with using my savings to put money in as well.

3) Investments in the Stock Market - Should I be looking to invest in the stock market? I've read that since the loans have a guaranteed rate of increase, I should be more focused on paying those back first rather than doing anything in the stock market, but I am open to any ideas.

4) Living Arrangements - This is probably more of an ""emotional"" decision rather than a ""financially smart"" decision. But I wanted to get other people's thoughts. I have 3 options:

* Living at home - definitely could save the most money here. I would not need to pay for food, rent, etc. I live around 30-35 minutes away from campus (without traffic). Campus however does not allow for parking, so I would have to figure out something there - but this could be a possibility.
* Living with a Roommate - middle option - I honestly don't mind living with a roommate, but for this upcoming year, I don't know anyone coming in. Ideally I wouldn't want to live with someone that was just ""sharing a living space"" as I find that to not be enjoyable, so ""living with a roommate"" is appearing less optimal for me. I do have some friends that have a lease ending in early November, so I could potentially find somewhere to live with them, but I would have to figure out what to do between the months of August and November. In addition, it would make the leasing period unaligned with the school calendar which could be annoying in the future.
* Living by myself - My preferred option (emotionally) but the worst option financially. I think I would really enjoy living by myself and having my own space. However, rent currently around the area (North Carolina) is around 1.3 - 1.5k a month (not including utilities, etc) and I would have to spend a bit on furniture and whatnot. I probably wouldn't fully deck it out with a brand new couch, etc but I would at least need to purchase some tables and chairs.

CryptoCurrency,📊 Bitcoin 🥇 Due Diligence and Technical Analysis 📊,"#  This is why Bitcoin had been under pressure to begin with: 

&amp;#x200B;

It became evident that [hedge funds were short-selling tether](https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-hedge-funds-are-betting-against-tether-as-crypto-melts-down-11656322200) and Bitcoin in a coordinated attack, in an egregious attempt to establish for themselves a discount prior to buying up the crypto community. Why? Well, it became obvious that their agenda was to crash prices simply because they had an interest to buy. Goldman Sachs, for example, [blasted Bitcoin](https://dailyhodl.go-vip.net/2020/05/27/bitcoin-btc-billionaires-blast-goldman-sachs-after-financial-giant-says-crypto-not-a-viable-investment/) a few weeks ago, calling it 'not viable.' Yet, they were [simultaneously in talks to buy crypto assets](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/goldman-sachs-and-ftx-in-talks-for-bitcoin-crypto-derivatives) and derivatives. Goldman even [downgraded Coinbase](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/goldman-cuts-coinbase-to-sell-due-to-fall-in-crypto-prices-and-industry-activity-shares-drop/) among others to a 'sell' shortly before [engaging to buy Celsius](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/24/goldman-sachs-raising-funds-to-buy-celsius-assets-sources/).

This is straight out of the Hedge Fund playbook: short-sell companies and industries during low liquidity periods in order to force an epic discount so they can take ownership of them outright. In combination with the planned acquisitions which reveal bullish outlooks, some of the hedge funds are already flipping from short to long. For example, [Deutsche Bank just called for a sharp Bitcoin rebound to $28k](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-29/deutsche-bank-says-bitcoin-could-reach-28-000-by-year-end#xj4y7vzkg).

&amp;#x200B;

# Let's look at the Technicals:

&amp;#x200B;

[ Weekly Chart - Fibonacci Retrace with a Support-Catalyst Bounce above 200 Week Simple Moving Average ](https://preview.redd.it/2v8q2e7wnm991.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9e8bf6db75f0f1ac7c58889be99784aeadf0104)

&amp;#x200B;

As we can see, the technicals reveal rising price supports, implying a likely rebound back above $20000 prior to a strong short term rebound to $36,500.00. This number is derived above from a key Fibonacci retracement level, as shown above, but also the fact that weekly simple moving averages have so much weight. The 200 week SMA is to serve as a support-catalyst for the price to conduct a fibonacci retracement upwards.

On the economics side, we can clearly see that demand is beginning to outstrip supply, on the order of about 2x, which has not impacted the price yet. When active demand exceeds available supply, the price does go up.

From a trend analysis, too we see three independent and rising support levels, squeezing the price upwards above the hourly 50SMA. As we can see in the middle of the chart, when this maneuver happens, it is usually met with outsized buy-volume.

[The Working Group, aka Plunge Protection Team is actively meeting about CryptoAssets](https://preview.redd.it/kuzc5yr3om991.png?width=1340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60ec166f1e6e0d3bcd665fb43c0c4a6ae85e2c8a)

&amp;#x200B;

We've already had the worst start to a stock year since 1952. The Working Group on Financial Markets is in close contact daily - via cell phone, text, email. So when Gary Gensler says, mid-market-crash and completely out of the blue \[and after Bitcoin had already fallen 70%\], that Bitcoin is a '*commodity*', I urge you to ask yourself why. Why are [they in fact meeting about crypto and only crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/biden-official-says-us-government-could-pass-stablecoin-rules-by-end-of-year/) at this time?

This could be evidence of intent that the Federal Reserve wants to take crypto over, just like they did with the gold supply in '33. They paid for that gold with cash, so it was good to have gold at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

[Like the discovery of Oil, this Executive Order is an example of how the U.S. Government will demand-to-buy assets from you when they consider something a Commodity](https://preview.redd.it/53hzvtw4om991.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b059dfa33ebbf9788f84166b21f2f2088760d70d)

&amp;#x200B;

All of this Federal Reserve eyeing up Crypto comes after they went to MIT advanced researchers to conduct a vast, manhattan-project-like project known as *Project Hamilton* on cryptocurrency - called the [Central Bank Digital Currency \[CBDC\]](https://dci.mit.edu/cbdc-central-bank-digital-currency)). They have since done research with collaboration with [the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada as well](https://dci.mit.edu/research/tag/cbdc).

The Federal Reserve and the U.S. Government is 'the' prospective crypto buyer here. So what do they do? Answer: They command their clientele to buy. Yes. In some cases, they can steal it. In the case of crypto, it's showing itself as a little bit of both. I believe this is why the Fed's clients (Prime Brokers and subsequently, Hedge Funds) had the confidence to short the crypto market down from $3.0T market cap to $0.8 market cap overnight, giving themselves a considerable discount on the commodity of Bitcoin now and into the future.

&amp;#x200B;

# Other Notable Buyers:

Sam Bankman-Fried is one of a handful of whales who are buying everything it seems. [FTX US just acquired BlockFi, valuing the crypto lender at $680 million](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-blockfi-crypto-deal-183322116.html). Multiple reports are in that he's [eyeing distressed miners next](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-01/sam-bankman-fried-explores-buying-distressed-crypto-miners-next). Further, Bankman-Fried’s quantitative trading firm Alameda [committed $500 million in financing to Voyager](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/sam-bankman-fried-rescues-crypto-lenders-blockfi-voyager.html). Bankman-Fried is known by some as the 'future Warren Buffett'. MicroStrategy as well just [bought $10M worth of Bitcoin here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-saylor-buy-june-29-2022-185345513.html). Also, the country of [El Salvadore is actively buying at these low prices](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/el-salvador-purchases-80-additional-014151218.html).

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR (Conclusion):

We showed that The Working Group is meeting regularly, and mysteriously discussing crypto after the overall equities market had the worst start to a year in 52 years. The U.S. Government is nearly complete with a long-term Central Bank Digital Currency project (*Project Hamilton*) and are now coordinating with the Bank of England and Bank of Canada to implement crypto. Last week, we then saw Bitcoin receive the historic *Commodity* classification, making it similar to material gold and oil. This could be the underlying intent of why Prime Brokers were green-lighted into the crypto-industry-wide, toxic takeover.

We showed that then the Hedge Funds for a few months had conducted a coordinated attack on the once $3.0 Trillion market cap in crypto, bringing the sector down to $0.8 Trillion. They too short-sold Tether in an attempt to depeg it. They have seemingly failed, hence now why hedge funds are now flipping from short to long.

Yet, whales are stepping in to 'buy everything' at these levels, from Bankman-Fried to Michael Saylor, to El Salvador, and retail buyers, among other governments and firms. Bankman-Fried is saving Voyager, and has acquired BlockFi in a near-$1B deal. Goldman Sachs is flipping from short to long in the buyout of Celsius. Deutsche Bank, too, has flopped from short to long, and is calling for an immediate price increase in Bitcoin to near $30,000.00.

The technicals revealed rising price supports, implying a likely rebound back above $20000 at any moment. These rising trends combine with a technical bounce upward from the 200 week SMA, which serves as a support-catalyst for a mid-macro Fibonacci retracement to $36,500.00. Economically we are seeing demand for Bitcoin begin to exceed available supply.

I worked my former job for roughly 4 years. I had claimed exempt for a few months in 2021 and owed less than 400$ in federal taxes. I recently left that job and entered my actualy qualified career field and when I received my final paystub from my former job and all of my other paystubs (w head an app that stored them) I realized the system still had me marked as exempt, however I wasn't aware of this. I am not exempt at my current job btw. I know you cannot legally filed exempt 2 years in a row, so how screwed am I? I am genuinely concerned. I posted previously about being marked exempt as I had noticed it a few months back and went through the app to fix it. Turns out - it was not corrected. Please help

Also a side note: my former job also sent me the info for my 401k/retirement. I've tried to contact them about putting it into a separate retirement account however I'm not getting a direct answer. So I've been contemplating saying f it and withdrawing it myself and putting it into a savings/retirement account I have with my credit union. It's just over 12k, they after the 10% penalty and 20% it takes in taxes to withdrawl, I'd get just over 8k. There is a time limit to roll it over but they're not much help on getting that situated. Would it be worth it to just withdrawl it and put it in my other account myself or do I need to keep trying even though they're not helping much?

Thank you for the help. I'm just trying to sort out the financial issues so I can properly be done w and handle everything with my former employer and not have to worry.",finance,1656975072
personalfinance,Immediately Refinance?,We unexpectedly found and made an offer on a house last month that was accepted and we just closed on it. I used the same broker that I used last year for a refinance of our current house due to the speed that the sellers needed to close in (had to move for a job and house was priced that way). To get to the point we got an “OK” rate (5.875) for what was going on with the fed hikes last month but I know I can get a better rate through Penfed. Looks like I can get it to 5% with no out of pocket costs and get it down to 4.875% with like $1300 in closing costs. Mortgage said no prepayment penalty’s though the broker said I “should” keep it for 6 months but I think that is only for their commission? Part of me wants to let him get it because he has done a good job but money is money and long term 1% is quite a bit of money. Are there any downsides to refinancing basically right away besides hit to our credit? Would save me about 3-400 a month on our payments though PMI is higher. Current house is on the market and if it sells we will pay down the mortgage to get rid of PMI. Thoughts?,finance,1656975471

I plan on paying it back a lot faster than usual since I will have a few new streams of income  starting soon. I just got pre-approved for a personal loan through Opertun but the APR is like 36%.

btc,WaPo: Bill to grant crypto firms access to Federal Reserve alarms experts,"&gt;A wave of notoriously risky cryptocurrency firms could one day be integrated into the traditional banking system under a little-noticed provision in a new bill that is raising alarms among financial experts about potentially destabilizing consequences.

&gt;The provision — part of a sweeping proposal to regulate the crypto industry that Sens. Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced in June — would force the Federal Reserve to grant so-called master accounts to certain crypto firms seeking them from the central bank. The accounts give holders access to the Fed’s payment system, allowing them to settle transactions for clients without involving a separate bank.

&gt;Two Wyoming-based crypto firms championed by Lummis stand to benefit. Both companies, Custodia Bank and Kraken Financial, have been stymied over the last two years in bids to gain Fed master accounts. But financial regulators and experts say the measure’s impact would cascade through the industry and beyond.

Trading,Is USD/JPY showing signs of topping out?,"Policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan fuelled the immense rally over the last few months that has taken USD/JPY to 24-year highs. But speculation that inflation and a weak currency may cause the BOJ to pivot towards normalisation seem to be causing the move to stall. 

However, with the BOJ likely to maintain their ultra-easy monetary policy over the near-term, a significant pullback for the pair could be more likely to stem from USD weakness. 

Growing expectation that US inflation and Fed hawkishness may have peaked has seen the US 10-year yield dip back below 3%, which is of added interest given the strong positive correlation it has with USD/JPY. If this week’s US PMI data and the NFP report now disappoint and further fuel recession concerns, the greenback may begin to move lower. 

The weekly chart for USD/JPY highlights a tight range on an opening-closing basis in the last 2 weeks, with 135 acting as magnet for the pair, and the inability to sustain breakouts above 136 may indicate that bulls are running out of steam. 

Of course, all trading carries risk, but it should be interesting to see if the pair retraces in the near-term, or if the Yen continues to fall against the Dollar.",finance,1656986108

personalfinance,Using Cash from a Home Equity Co-Investment Toward Down Payment on a 2nd Property,"Hi all,

So in my current situation, I'm living in a 3 bedroom house that I purchased in mid-2019. In the past I rented out both of the extra bedrooms, but at the moment I'm just renting out one of them. My goal is to buy a second house to move into within the next year or so and then rent out the 3 bedrooms of my current place. I have about $35k-$40k saved up for a down payment / closing costs on the new house - not quite enough to cover the recommended 20% down on a 2nd home, at least for my price range (this would also deplete a large portion of my emergency savings fund, but I think I could replenish this quickly by renting out all the rooms in my current place as well as renting out some in the new place).

Like many other properties around the country, the value of my home has gone up quite a bit over the last few years - roughly 30%, at least according to the Zillow estimate. So I've been looking into home equity co-investment opportunities that I could use to take some cash out from the equity in my current place to use as a down payment on the 2nd home. I recently applied with Unison, and with their estimate it looks like I could get a little over $50k in cash from them. If you're unfamiliar with how it works, Unison will give you cash in exchange for a percentage of equity in your property (up to 17.5%). From my understanding, you don't owe them any monthly payments or anything, but when you sell your home, they get a share of the gain or loss in the value of your property. You're also able to make payments to them at any time to reduce the amount that you would ultimately owe them when you sell. FYI, I wouldn't plan to sell this place in the near term, and hopefully would keep it as a full-time rental property for a while.

If I do decide to go with a home equity co-investment, it seems like the time to do it is now, before the housing market goes into a potential downswing with the recent (and potentially more in the future) interest rate hikes and my home value decreases. I would then wait to see if property values do come down a bit over the next year or so, and then use the cash from the co-investment toward a down payment on the 2nd property… and then hopefully later being able to refinance this property once interest rates come back down.

&amp;#x200B;

So a few questions I have:

(1) Generally speaking, what are your thoughts on this strategy? Good idea, bad idea?

(2) For anyone familiar with home equity co-investments, what do you think of them? Have you had any positive/negative experiences with them in the past?

(3) Is my estimate on timing the housing market fair? I'd also like to get anyone else's thoughts on what they think will happen with property values over the next 5 years or so (my somewhat uninformed assumption is they will go down a bit \[no idea how much\] but then go back up once interest rates return to close to where they were before).",finance,1656989915
personalfinance,Inheritance and Asset Management company,"Greetings,

I've been consistently reading as much as I can about investment, including in this forum for some time.

I'm 32 and my father has recently left me inheritance in the amount of 2.1 million after tax.

I had a meeting with an Asset Management firm based in NY, a recommendation of someone I really respect and trust, and they made an allocation suggestion that I feel is really inappropriate for the current economic scenario of global recession.

They proposed the following:

**Fixed income (40%)**

\- Bonds 600,000

\- Oaktree global credit 100,000

\- Pico income 100,000

**Equities (30%)**

\- SPY US 200,000

\- VTV 200,000

\- AB American growth 200,000

**Alternatives (30%)**

\- Kawa fund 300,000

\- Rates funds 300,000

Any help would be very welcome and immensely appreciated. I don't have anyone else to speak about investment to.

Some of my concerns are:

\- In this global hiperinflation scenario why would I allocate any money into equity indexes now? shouldn't; I hold a cash position until we have a better outlook for global monetary policy? And then allocate 30% into equity? Feels like im going to buy just before the dip......

\- Fixed income funds suggest the Oaktree global credit and Pimco Income fund have really negative YTD and 1 year performances. I understand they are actively managed but the Oaktree is at -6% YTD and the PIMCO is at -7.5% 1 yr. Why would they suggest allocation in these&gt;? Do they expect these to rise from now on?

I'm a very conservative person. I work very hard alongside my wife in our small business and I see this inheritance as a good safety net, in which I don't plan to touch for years to come. I would like to be as conservative as possible at this moment in time with consideration of the current market situation.

With this in mind, does this allocation sound they fit my profile? What positions would you go for at this moment in time?

personalfinance,Best way to payoff loans?,"What is the best way to go about paying off my loans?

I have a car loan with an APR of 5.25% and a balance of  $2,180.75, 3 student loans: $3,721.28 @ 3.86% , $5,500 @ 4.53%, and $678.72 @ 4.53%. BUT my student loans are actually accruing 0% interest until I graduate in March. There's also a furniture financing I just opened for $800 at 0% for the next 18 months and then I think the APR is 19% or something ridiculous, but I plan on making minimum payments on that so that I don't have any interest. I also have a credit card that I'll be paying off before any of these because the interest rate is 24%. But after that, should I work towards paying off my car because it is gathering interest currently? Or should I put in as much money as I can into my student loans so that the interest will be as low as possible? I'm not sure if I could manage paying them off completely before I graduate. 

What would be the best way to pay off my debt?",finance,1657007583

If you're in the US, we hope you enjoyed your Fourth of July Weekend!

 

https://preview.redd.it/k9uhkx5zop991.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfc5c1ae7c36a14bd359bfebefe0568d0e56929f

Did you realize you ‘re a revolutionary? Yes! In a sense, you’re helping revolutionize the future of finance. 

Over the holiday weekend, I sat down and listened to a podcast titled [""The Crypto Revolution,"" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0psJ5JjjNrw)where historian Josh Rosenthal paralleled similarities between crypto events and world history.

The podcast was fascinating regarding the similarities between financial history and events unfolding in Crypto. While human efforts in the past were slow to evolve, Crypto allows many of the same financial fluctuations to develop at digital speeds. What took centuries to occur in the real world is now playing out in months on-chain.

Josh Rosenthal noticed some parallels.

* The double-entry [bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) in Florence, Italy, in the 13th century, democratized finance and led to the Renaissance. The liquidity available to Florians spurred economies able to support the emergence of arts and science. A similar event unwinded during the crypto bull run of 2021; vast amounts of capital sparked a revolution in digital art to include NFTs.
* The American Revolution was an experiment in decentralized governance away from the centralized system of a monarchy. The USA built a bottom-up approach to represent the people. Likewise, the basis of Crypto, at its core, is to democratize finance: to remove finance from centralized decision-making.
* When the American Revolution began, three major political influences existed in the US. The Federalist, the Anti-federalist, and the anarchist. The Anarchists wanted no central government. Think of them as Bitcoiners. The Federalists wanted a centralized government to uphold the new values and ideals—a similar system to Ethereum. The anti-federalists were seeking state-based governance, a fair comparison to Cosmos.    

While there remain magnitude changes ahead of us, we will get to witness human ideals and interactions being processed on-chain. A revolution is occurring in real-time at digital speeds, and we all get to be part of it!

# Record inflows into short-Bitcoin product

According to the Weekly Coinshare [repor](https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-87-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-ef9a4c955c32)t, last week, there was a total inflow of US$64m into digital asset investment products. Unfortunately, a majority were into short-bitcoin products (US$51m). Ethereum saw a second week of inflows totaling US$5m.

# Market update 🌍

The crypto market drivers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, continue to hover near the major support levels of 20k and 1k. However, considering the recent correlation between stocks and Crypto, the duo's fate appears closely tied to micro-economic factors for the time being. In this regard, it's best to follow crucial economic news to garner an idea of future direction.

Several crypto assets with solid use cases, such as Evmos, Arweave (AR), and Synthetix (SNX), have bucked correlation with Bitcoin to make notable runs this past week, although temporary it may be. Nonetheless, investors appear to be focusing on those projects that adhere to unique use-cases over projects with high speculation. This trend will be essential to follow as it may point toward a more rigid methodology for valuing digital assets.

**EVMOS/USDT**

EVMOS, the EVM-compatible Cosmos Chain, has sustained a price uptrend since its recent debut. The EVMOS token has seen a 39% climb since 7 June, a notable feat considering the condition of the majority of the crypto market. With a modest $457m market cap, EVMOS may have more room to run.

# Newswatch 📰

**Peter Schiff bank closure**. Peter Schiff, an economist and a notable open critic of cryptocurrency, is facing closure by local regulators of his Puerto Rican-based bank for not maintaining the net minimum capital requirements. As a result, the regulator froze customer assets. O, the irony!

**Celsius repays debt.** Celsius has repaid a $120m stablecoin debt to MakerDao (MKR) and has reduced the protocol's liquidation risk. As a result, its new BTC liquidation price stands at $4,966.

**British Army social media accounts hacked.** Crypto scammers took possession of the British Army Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube for nearly four hours yesterday to opportunistically market NFT scams.

 

**News tidbits:**

* Hacker asks for 10 Bitcoin for allegedly stolen data of a billion Chinese citizens.
* ENS domain 000.eth sells for 300 ETH.
* Elon Musk’s Tesla is facing a $440m writedown on its Bitcoin holdings.
* Vauld exchange suspends customer withdrawals amidst “financial challenges.”

**At the protocol level ⛓**

**Cardano’s Vasil Testnet merge successful.** Cardano's testnet merge is complete, and all that remains is to fork the mainnet, which developers predict will occur in the next four weeks. The upgrade allows for faster block creation and, in turn, greater scalability.

# Writer’s take

The original ideas contrived by US citizens during the American Revolution were a step away from a governance system that favored the few, to one that encompassed its citizens. While that system continues to be tested/altered/interpreted by a magnitude of modern challenges, at its core, it was a bold experiment at improvement.

With Crypto, we are at the frontlines of the financial revolution. Challenges, battles, and various governance proposals will ultimately shape its future. We are the participants. No one knows where that future leads but an improvement from the current, often ineffective financial system is the ultimate goal.

stocks,Timing the market,"I noticed whenever someone gave a hint of timing the market, it is quickly dismissed with comments like ""time in the market...."", ""DCA"" or ""let me take out my crystal ball"". So I want to preface my question by saying ""you don't need to believe in Jesus to study the bible"". I'm not going to debate whether ""timing the markmet"" is a good/better strategy, I just want to understand ""timing the market"" as a strategy, I just want to know the reasons, signals and indicators to support such strategy. 

So If you're currently holding a sizeable cash position (would be helpful to indicate it as percentage of your total investible fund), what are you waiting for and when will you enter? From what I have gathered so far:

1. Fed QT. At what stage of QT would you consider it is good enough? Do you have a number? Like after how many $T?
2. Fed Rate Hike. Are you looking for a number or a trend? E.g. when the rate is over 2%, or when it is slowing down, e.g. 0.75 -&gt; 0.75 -&gt; 0.50 -&gt; 0.25 (!?!) 
3. Recession. How many quarters into recession?
4. SPX. 3500, 3200, 3000, 2800 etc?
5. Global events. End of war, end of supply chain issue, end of Covid?
6. Some technical/analytical indicators. SMA? Candles? Volumes?
7. Anything else?

This is probably Part 1 of the discussion, the main objective is to find out why you're still sitting on the side lines. Later on we can discuss how you're re-entering and then what you're actually buying.

stocks,"Can stocks truly stage a rally in the second half, or are the fundamentals too negative eg. with a potential Russian gas pipeline shutdown?","It's easy to look at statistics to see how violently the market has often rallied after a historically bad first half. However, a year such as 2008 stands out as an example of a year where things simply went from bad to worse, even with the first 6 months already being historically awful. The reason being that fundamentally nothing positive was occurring, or anywhere to be seen.

In order for the market to change direction, at the very least the market needs to catch a whiff of a potentially positive change in fundamentals. A Ukraine ceasefire, a Fed u-turn, something concerning oil production.. and these are not necessarily in the cards yet. Above all, I can't see a situation where electricity prices and gas prices don't blow up in Europe during the winter. There is not even a spark of hope regarding a ceasefire, either. If anything, Russia re-engineering its industries to support prolonged wartime production.

So, TL;DR - what positive catalysts are you guys seeing that could even potentially cause markets to rally in the next half? I'm read and willing to huff on some high quality copium, but I want to stay realistic.",finance,1657015880
Forex,"Can AUD/USD continue to hold support at 0.6800, or will the pair breakdown?","Traders were quick to dump AUD/USD following today’s 0.5% hike from the RBA, as the central bank raised rates for a third consecutive month. 

While this outcome was widely expected after Governor Lowe had essentially taken 75bps off the table for this meeting, confirmation of the decision may be fuelling speculation that the RBA won’t look to be more aggressive than 50bp increments. As a result, AUD/USD is currently retesting 0.6800, and after two failed attempts in the last two sessions, a close below this level may open the door for an even steeper pullback. 

However, Lowe also reiterated that the board will continue to factor in a variety of economic factors in future decisions, and AU inflation is forecast to hit 7% by the end of the year. So perhaps expectations for the RBA to front-load rate hikes, coupled with speculation of a peak in Fed hawkishness, can encourage buyers to step-in and help the pair hold support here. 

All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see how this plays out with key US economic data due this week, as well as Australian inflation figures at the end of July.",finance,1657018753

personalfinance,"Can I dispute a credit card charge used to pay off a collection, when the collector hasn’t followed up?","I’m starting to get a little pissed and also feel fairly foolish. 

I am applying for mortgages and ended up being forced to choose between applying with this thing ($1300 collection account for an ambulance bill four years ago) still on my credit, or waiting while rates continue to rise. I decided to negotiate for removal before applying, rather than risk the bank making me pay it in full *and* it impacting my rate. So at the beginning of June I called them to start negotiating and it took two weeks but on June 15 they agreed to accept $800 to pay it off and remove it from my credit reports. I used my Apple/Goldman Sachs card to pay it, in part knowing that GS is extremely consumer friendly with disputes. They said they would email me the letter as soon as they had the payment, but of course they didn’t. I called back again last week and they said they normally update credit reporting on around the 20th but we’re behind that month, and they would re-send the letter by emailed PDF. Now it’s July 5 and I have no letter and it’s still on my credit, my “inquiry cluster” window is about to expire, and I really want to get in one more mortgage application but would prefer a better credit score. I actually have preapprovals now from two different banks but still want to try my own bank (USAA) for maybe a better rate. 

I’m getting ready to call the creditor back to follow up on this but I want to know whether disputing the charge with Goldman Sachs is a credible threat that I could leverage. I paid them for removal and they haven’t sent even a letter. But, I think maybe they could validate the charge to GS just by citing the original debt, so maybe that’s a worthless threat on my part. 

Any ideas?

And yes I know, always get it in writing before paying, but I was desperate to get this thing off because the need for a mortgage came up abruptly. I’d been wanting to move for years but stuck in my house for various reasons, until last month out of the blue an investor made a good as-is offer and when not having to deal with cleaning, marketing, and repairs it became feasible to walk. It’s going to be a great situation for me as selling the old house pays off some other debts and even though the new house is twice the price, even with today’s interest rates my overall DTI magically goes down. But I also feel I have to act now because of the uncertainty of my self-employed taxable income and I really have no idea whether I’ll get approved for whatever local prices here are next year, not to mention that I’m in love with this particular neighborhood.",finance,1657026929

personalfinance,"25 Year Old LF for Financial Advice, Single Income, Family of 4","Hello all first post here. Was wondering if someone could offer some advice on my situation.

My budget is as follows.
I make about $4,900 a month after taxes.
My total amount in bills are $3,573.
That leaves me with $1,300.

I owe roughly $8,000 on three credit cards. One @ $2,000 with an interest rate at the normal 20% +, the second one @ $3,000 with the interest rate at 20% +, and the final credit card has 0% interest for 48 months for my lawnmower. I currently pay $100 a month towards it to pay it off before the interest hits.

Detailed bills :
Groceries $400 a month
Insurance $280
Mortgage $980
Phone Bill $169
Gas $200 to $350
First CC - paying $200 a month currently
Second CC - paying $100 a month currently
Third CC - interest free, paying $100
2 cars 1 @ $6,000 at 3% interest rate - 276 a month and the other vehicle is @ $42,000 at 2.5% interest rate 600 a month.
Utilities $195
Comcast $ 60

personalfinance,Sell House and Rent or Keep House with Lower Rate,"I bought back in 2020 a 2,000 sqft house for $255,000 w/ a 3.75% rate. It was a USDA loan so I put $0 down on the loan. Currently pay $1,600 a month for the mortgage, taxes, insurance and owe roughly $248,000 on the load. Current valuations for the house are anywhere from $380,000 to $420,000. So selling would net me about $150,000 before any relator fees or any other costs. 

I have been thinking about selling while the value is high, pocketing the cash, and then renting for a year or two and eventually buying something bigger. However, the thing that worries me is that interest rates are going to keep going up and I'll be paying way more in the future.

We are eventually going to want to move into a bigger house because we are already starting to outgrow the current house. So my question is would it be smarter to sell now and rent for a year or two before doing so, or stay in the current house, keep our super low interest rate, and then just sell in a year or two when we are ready to buy.",finance,1657032804

Worse Case Scenario With The Fed

The most significant risk I see for the coming year, which is a worst-case scenario, is that:

1. The Fed is unable to stop inflation (which is a no-brainer).
2. Attempts to combat it result in a recession (another no-brainer).
3. The Fed decides that fighting inflation during a recession is too painful and risks a severe economic depression.
4. The Fed reverses course, loosens monetary conditions, and increases inflation.
5. The Fed is If this series of events takes place, Ray Dalio’s inflationary depression scenario becomes plausible.

Currently have around a decent amount that I can use as a down payment, when the time comes to actually go and buy a property, I should have saved up even more. Goal is a 3/2 single family home, but preferably a 4/3.

So the question is - With interest rates rising, would it be better to put a larger down payment and have a lower mortgage to avoid interest rates, and have a lower monthly bill? Or stick with the standard 20% (or even less) down payment and have a higher monthly bill?

Current credit score is \~800-810s, so would one method or the other affect my credit score?  
Also, with inflation rates going crazy, would the down payment be worth less later down the line? For example, a 50k down payment is worth 50k today, but may only be worth 48k or 47k in 2-3 years, which would then incentivize putting a larger down payment now, correct?

I was trying to figure out around what percentage of interest rate I would have and what insurance coverage I could get by finding out my credit score. I went through the official government channels to figure them out back in the pandemic. That's when I saw it.

So, I went to the nearest branch of said bank and tried to explain to them that I didn't make this account or have a card through them. When they looked it up, they said they couldn't take it out of my name since I had paid credit on it before. Feeling absolutely lost, I looked up who else I could tell this to since I wasn't lying like I thought the bank I was. I turned to the police. I told them I had looked up my credit score, printed out all three, reported this to the bank that was on the papers, and they didn't help me find out who had done this and had made sure it couldn't be erased under my name. They handled it from there. I then tried to alert my mother, who I did NOT know was behind it at this time, and got nothing but backlash out of her, so I hung up and allowed the police to deal with the situation.

According to Core Scientific, they used proceeds through the sale of BTC to pay for ASIC miners, schedule debt repayments, and invest in additional data center capacity. The company reported that it produced 1,106 BTC in June, with self-mining accounting for 57% of data center capacity, and crypto mining as of June 30, over 180,000 miners.  


“Our mining industry is under tremendous stress as capital markets weaken, interest rates rise and the economy deals with historic inflation,” said CEO Mike Levitt. Core Scientific has successfully weathered downturns in the past, and we are confident in our ability to navigate the current market volatility.”  


Amid the current extreme market conditions and extreme price volatility, many Bitcoin miners have reportedly changed their business strategy by selling instead of accumulating as before. This inadvertently created **a huge pressure on the BTC price reaction in the past time**.  


As evidenced also in June, another major Bitcoin mining company, **Bitfarms, sold 3,000 BTC**, or about 47% of its holdings, for $62 million as part of a strategy to improve liquidity and repay debt. . Meanwhile, the last ray of hope of the **Bitcoin Marathon mining industry encountered a force majeure event**, and it is highly likely that it will also sell in the near future, causing the sector to fall into a state of extreme stalemate.",cryptocurrency,1657078452
personalfinance,"Solar tax credit if I don’t own the house, but my parents do.","Hello, i am trying to get solar for my parents house. I currently live with my parents and file taxes separately and they don’t claim me as a dependent. I want to get solar for the house as I am planning to get an EV and I would like to pay for the solar bill itself and also get the tax credit and my parents are okay with this. I was wondering if I can do this ? The electricity bill is under my dads name and loan is also his name and also my sisters name too. I want to know if I can get solar under my name or if not even under my sisters name and can claim the tax credit with our taxes ? Instead of my parents taxes? I know it’s an interesting situation but just an option I was debating over. I don’t have any CA tax credit stuff to work out just the federal tax credit.  

Thanks !",finance,1657082391
personalfinance,Facing Foreclosure – what to expect?,"My wife and I bought a place in May of 2020.  We had just relocated across the country to be near my work and my family in case one of us or the kids got Covid.  We ended up buying a place in rural CA, in the foothills, nice enough and big enough for all of us but not fancy.  Paid $350K.  Immediately after signing the papers, like the same day, I found out that I was to be furloughed at work due to lockdowns and slowing business.  I ended up missing out on almost 40% of my income for that year, then there was a realignment at work and I came back at a lower salary.  Following that, and right about the time the American Rescue Plan came into effect, we had a premature baby and all the bills associated with that.  I was able to utilize the mortgage forbearance program for over a year while we paid off medical bills but when that program ended, we knew we were going to be really tight.   
  

Over the past winter, we had a stroke of good fortune.  My wife's family had rental property in a town closer to my work, with better schools for the kids, and basically gave it to us.  So we made the move, got the kids into school at the new place, and got the house we'd bought all spruced up and listed for sale.      
  

But we missed the market.  When we listed it at 80K over what we'd paid, we were about four weeks too late.  It's been on the market for several months now.  Lots of action, lots of interest, but between fire insurance and high interest rates, whoever buys it will have much higher payments than we do at our 3.25%.  In the meantime, we've felt the price increases at the grocery store and gas pump, we've been paying utilities on two houses for nine months now, and we've had another unexpected medical expense and a major car repair.  After putting off a lot of things to keep making the mortgage while the house was for sale, this month, the money just isn't there.  I can't keep food on the table and make it to work and back without being at least two weeks late on the mortgage.   
  

So: I can drop the sale price of the house one more time to what it would have to be just for us to skate out of there at break-even with the realtor fees.  The other expenses aren't going to go down any time soon and, when we fall a month behind on our payments we aren't likely to catch up with them.  If the house doesn't sell before foreclosure, I'm sweating what that would do to our credit, first, but also somewhat relieved because without the mortgage payment, a third of my paycheck goes back into the operating budget and savings.  We have a car loan but no other debt so we'd actually be living pretty comfortably without the burden of that house.   
  

Has anybody here had the experience of going through a foreclosure or work for a mortgage company?  What should I expect and how can I best deal with these loan officers to ensure I'm getting a fair shake?  The payoff amount on the mortgage comes to something like $70K below the market value; so is there any possibility that I can just have a conversation with my lender about just turning the keys over and mitigating the damage to our financial histories?  There's already a for sale sign in the yard.",finance,1657083447

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss. Two big eUTxO advantages in this regard relate to concentrated liquidity and fee determinism.

12. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
13. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

15. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources. It’s been obvious this was coming for a while ever since the reports of mining operations dumping hot waste water into the finger lakes and affecting the ecology. In a place like New York, that kind of thing won’t go unnoticed.

16. Reports are also coming in that the Biden Administration crypto plans due in August will target Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains over their “sky high” energy consumption. I think we all knew this would eventually come despite the wide spectrum of clever rationalizations regarding Bitcoin’s energy use by its maximalists.

21. Today (June 7), we may get the Lummis-Gillibrand Comprehensive Crypto Bill.

23. Bitcoin maximalists REALLY don’t like this data about how concentrated Bitcoin mining was in the early days.

26. Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill. Fortunately, it is actually the courts who get to interpret law (when it’s actually passed) in the US and not anonymous people on press calls.

defi,Does DeFi play a vital role in the Crypto Market?,"&amp;#x200B;

[DeFi Development Services](https://preview.redd.it/36v0wwr35x991.png?width=2240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1503aa29bc9ebe8263ccdd490b8bad3dc3d6ce8d)

Yes. Surely. When you read this blog, you will know the importance of DeFi. 

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) plays a vital role in the crypto market. DeFi focuses on developing a new financial system that is completely different from TradFi (Traditional Finance). 

All around the world, thousands of people invest billions of dollars in the goal of DeFi. This article speaks about what DeFi is and its importance in Crypto Market.

**What is DeFi?**

DeFi is an upcoming financial technology that offers a new vision for banking and financial services. That purely focuses on the safely distributed ledger. The system eliminates the control banks and organizations have on money, financial services, and financial products. 

DeFi is referred to as a trustless application since it is not controlled by third parties like a government or bank. The concept of decentralization was introduced to use the platform globally. This process attracts investors to DeFi.

**What did investors do in DeFi?**

DeFi permits the investor to act as a bank, that can lend and earn money like a traditional bank account. An investor can access or send money globally without any transactional fees. Here are some of the aspects magnetized by the people.

**Key Features of DeFi**

1. Decentralized Exchange
2. DeFi won't charge fees for the services offered by other financial companies and banks.
3. Automated Market Maker
4. Money can be saved in a digital wallet instead of saving in a bank.
5. Non-Fungible Tokens
6. There is no need for any approval to use DeFi.
7. Funds can be transferred quickly.

Next, this article talks about how DeFi operates and benefits individuals. 

**How does DeFi Operate?**

DeFi aims to offer numerous financial services for customers like loans, payments, interest on deposits, etc, with decentralized technology. To this effect, DeFi develops a new infrastructure to provide existing financial services in a decentralized manner. 

To do this operation DeFi uses smart contracts and blockchain technology with other tools. Blockchain is a type of ledger technology used to track financial transactions on a crypto platform.  

Here, smart contracts are used as building blocks of DeFi, which are nothing but executable code to preserve cryptocurrencies and interact with blockchain-based on its rules. 

Once DeFi is enabled, the smart contract executes the transactions between the participants automatically. DeFi also permits smart contracts on the blockchain with verified intermediaries like a bank for peer-to-peer transactions. 

This transaction process supports services like investment, payment, lending, etc, and also helps investors to earn more income from the crypto market. 

**How Does it Benefit the Individuals?**

1. Bye-Bye to mismanagements and human errors.
2. Permanent and Fast access.
3. Permissionless Operations.

Next, this article details the famous cryptocurrency market and how it works, and in what way DeFi plays an important role in the crypto market.

## Why is DeFi so important for Crypto Market?

The influence of DeFi in the crypto market is huge. This takes crypto trading into a new and smart one.  

The Crypto market is nothing but a crypto exchange website where everyone can sell, buy and exchange cryptocurrencies. This exchange converts cryptocurrencies to government currencies and also to other currencies as needed by individuals. 

Let’s have a look at the major ways that DeFi influences the crypto market. 

**Turn Your Lending/Borrowing Smart** 

If so, let us see the DeFi ecosystem. Lending and borrowing service is the most important part of the DeFi ecosystem. customers can lock their crypto position with a smart contract and earn profits by lending their coins to borrowers. 

One thing to be noticed is that the lender earns a profit that is much higher than the profit earned with traditional finance. Using a smart contract is more effective than using traditional bank service, so profits earned from lending money are forwarded directly to the lender through a smart contract. 

For this reason, most people have trusted smart contracts and also can earn more profits. Some of the borrowing and lending platforms in the DeFi ecosystem are compound, aave, and flash alone. lets us see its services in upcoming phrases. 

**Make Compound Rates in DeFi Ecosystem**

The compound is nothing but an autonomous algorithmic protocol used for borrowing and lending services in the DeFi ecosystem. Users can borrow against crypto positions like ETH and stablecoin for spending. 

Users can start their earnings immediately by locking their assets into the compound protocol. Based on demand and supply, automatic adjustment takes place in compound interest rates. Here, cTokens represent the assets that gain interest. The compound protocol facilitates users to borrow 50% of their cToken values. Users can earn immediately and also can withdraw their profits at any time. 

## Aave and flash loans

Ave is an open-source, decentralized non-custodial protocol operating on Ethereum. Currently, in Aave smart contract there exists $11.8 billion. Like compound, Aave allows users to borrow and lend crypto assets and earn profits based on the demand and supply of the market. 

**Flash Loan**

For the interest of users, Aave offers a smart service named ""flash loan"". It refers to a ""one block borrow transaction"", which means users can borrow the loan and repay the loan on the same block itself. 

The smart contract provides loans to users based on the successful completion of borrow and repayment of the loan on the block itself. This is a unique feature utilized in quick trading and arbitrage. which is quite different from TradFi. 

Now, you can come to know that compound Aave and flash services raise the stability of cryptocurrency which ultimately increases the crypto market. 

Ultimately, DeFi aims to develop an open financial market that is permissionless and trustless. Investment and outstanding development lead to the advancement of DeFi, as a financial advisor you can understand its importance. 

In this way, DeFi created decentralized asset management firms, money markets, and banking. DeFi achieves 10x cheaper, faster, and better financial services compared to traditional financial services. 

In a nutshell, the following are key reasons for the importance of DeFi in the crypto market.

1. Decentralized, open-source, and safe.
2. DeFi provides its users to assess their assets freely.
3. DeFi provides numerous financial services that can be used by people globally.
4. DeFi is a perfect tool to stop monopoly and corruption.

stocks,(7/6) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Hump Day! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, July the 6th, 2022-

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed after a late day rally and ahead of Fed minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. equities futures were little changed on Wednesday morning after the market staged a big midday reversal on Tuesday, with falling bond yields giving a boost to growth stocks, and ahead of a batch of economic data.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were close to the flatline. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were also about flat.
*****
&gt; In regular trading, the Dow lost 129 points to start the holiday-shortened week, trimming steeper losses from earlier in the session. The S&amp;P 500 rallied back from a 2% loss in the final hour of trading and finished the day up 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed, jumping 1.75%.
*****
&gt; Whether the economy is about to fall into a recession continued to worry investors after the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell below the 2-year yield. The so-called yield curve inversion historically has been a warning sign that the economy may be falling or has already fallen into recession.
*****
&gt; Oil prices tumbled below $100 a barrel Tuesday, further reflecting a potential economic slowdown. Energy stocks were the top decliners Tuesday. The sector as a whole fell 4%. It was the top performing sector in the S&amp;P 500 for the first half of they year, the benchmark index’s worst first half since 1970.
*****
&gt; However, Wall Street analysts say a recession could be mild. On Tuesday Credit Suisse said it sees the U.S. dodging a recession as it slashed its year-end S&amp;P 500 target to reflect the effect of higher capital cost on stock valuations.
*****
&gt; ″[The market] has been bracing for [a recession], and now it may actually be embracing it, the idea being: let’s just get it over with, we’re going have a recession, let’s do it. Let’s clean out the excesses and start all over again,” said Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “The market starting to look ahead into next year and that could very well be a recovery year from whatever this recessionary environment turns out to be,” he added. “We’re all kind of doing a Hamlet recession – to be or not to be. I’m kind of thinking that there’s going to be a mild recession.”
*****
&gt; NewEdge Wealth chief investment officer Cameron Dawson echoed that sentiment.
*****
&gt; “Do we have a kind of drawdown that looks to be in that 30% range, which is the average for recessions, or something that looks closer to down 50%, which is what we saw back in the early 2000s and 2008 where we had two debt crises?” she said. “We don’t see a debt crisis. We think that we could start to find some value around that 3,400-3,500 level because that’s what gets us back to the pre-Covid highs.”
*****
&gt; There are no major earnings reports scheduled for Wednesday, but there will be a slew of economic reports coming out, including the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June meeting in the afternoon.
*****
&gt; Mortgage demand fell week over week even as rates declined, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The latest Markit and Institute for Supply Management manufacturing PMI data will be released at 9:45 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., respectively. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, will also be released at 10:00 a.m.

investing,Yield Curve Inverted.... Again,"Probably not a surprise, but wanted to share this for discussion points. Given, the initial and brief inversion in April 2022 garnered most of the attention, but I personally think this one will get a bit deeper unless the Fed immediately walks back some rhetoric. Keep in mind, the inversion in April occurred before the Fed had even started to raise interest rates. It was more or less off the back of traders selling short-dated bonds in advance of the hiking cycle, and doing so more than they ever had before. 

Typically the long dated end of the curve starts to call out the fed's bluff during a hiking cycle as growth starts to slow down, which ***may*** be what's happening right now. 

As for inevitable discussions of recession and lag time from inversions, keep in mind that statistically, there is a wide window in which markets may or may not react to an inversion. In the Dotcom bubble, there was a secondary inversion that occurred right as the tech market topped in March of 2000. Recession didn't occur until later, but for the purpose of investors trying not to lose money, the inversion essentially top-ticked markets. On the other hand, the initial GFC inversion occurred over 2 years before the 2008 meltdown. It persisted in being negative for quite some time after the initial inversion, which may have played a role in reducing lending activity.",finance,1657114296

Carbon credits generated from the project will be tokenized as ‘Algaecoin’.

Globacap

Globacap are an FCA regulated London-based UK firm specializing in unlocking private capital markets.

The company was founded to ‘…use emerging blockchain technology to completely change the underlying processes behind private capital markets’.  

Private capital markets grew to more than $7tn in 2021 and have shown explosive growth recently as investors look for higher returns.

Private markets are still dwarfed by the traditional asset management industry and are known to be inefficient in application, however, Globacap uses blockchain technology to reshape how private markets can operate, enabling transactions that rival the efficiency of public markets.

Back in 2019, Globacap partnered with the Tezos Foundation to take private markets to the next stage of evolution.

Now, Globacap has announced the launch of the world’s first blockchain-based algae biomass project developed and operated by Sustainable Impact Token (SIT).

defi,How does UniSwap get away with not filing tax forms?,"The SEC requires exchanges to collect KYC data to comply with federal regulations:  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp

I know the UniSwap Agreement says:

“We are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange or in any other capacity. You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your behalf nor do we collect or earn fees from your trades on the Protocol. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on the public distributed Ethereum blockchain.”

I’m a bit confused by this, because third-parties seem to disagree:

“UniSwap essentially makes money in two separate ways: trading fees and the UNI token. “ - https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-does-uniswap-make-money/#how-uniswap-makes-money

Practically speaking this U.S. based company *created* the service, *deployed* it, and *manage* it with upgrades, support, etc.

It’s like writing a script to ship baked goods without collecting tax, hosting it on a third-party server and saying: “Not ours!  So it’s not our tax obligation”.

Even if the service didn’t give them *any* return, I’d wonder how it avoids being classified as a non-profit.

Uber had legal issues trying to encroach on the taxi industry, but it essentially managed to consume it.  Now, it *is* the taxi industry.

They somehow manage to keep their drivers as “independent contractors” and get all the benefits the taxi industry only dreamed of.

Generally speaking, how is it that these major companies live deep in the legal gray area and come out ahead when others fail?

Some *very* smart people end up shooting themselves in the foot so...  I think it’s balls, luck, power (money), and actual utility more than anything.  

But, at least for now, it all seems suspect to me. 

The tech itself is actually pretty damn simple.  I just don’t see how new players can enter the space without insane risk to their personal lives.

personalfinance,"With mortgage rates increasing, at what interest rate does it make more sense to pay off a mortgage instead of investing?","So I know the general consensus is that it makes more sense to invest extra money into the market as opposed to paying off a mortgage due to the higher potential returns (at least currently). However… since mortgage rates have been climbing week by week, at what interest rate (if any) does it make more sense to actually invest the extra cash into paying down the mortgage instead. For example, if a 30-year fixed mortgage rate was about 10%, would you be trying to pay down this mortgage faster or would you still be investing the extra cash? Does the possibility of being able to refinance down the line influence your choice at all?

I have a few very old collections accounts (about $2k total) and partner has a few small credit cards which are all maxed out or nearly maxed out, also totaling about $2k. Interest rate on those is around 28%. We have a very, very small emergency fund and can't make big enough payments to really bring the balance down without obliterating our tiny savings account. We have kids so I'm not comfortable having no money in the bank for a couple months even if it makes sense in the long run.  

Partner's credit score is abysmal (~540) mine is a little better (642). I can potentially get a personal loan at my bank for $5000 at 6.99%. I'm trying to figure out of it makes sense to take this loan, pay off Crete cards and collections, and stick the extra thousand into bonds. 

I've done the math and for a five year loan our monthly payments would be about what we're paying on a all the cc now, plus we'd be saving on interest and after a year we'd have an extra $1000+ in savings and his score would improve drastically.

investing,US job openings slip but employment remains to be solid,"By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer

Employers posted 11.3 million job openings at the end of May, the [Labor Department said Wednesday](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf), down from nearly 11.7 million in April. Job openings reached 11.9 million in March, the highest level on records dating back more than 20 years. There are nearly two job openings for every unemployed person, a sharp reversal from the historic pattern: Before the pandemic, there were always more unemployed people than available jobs.

The figures reflect the unusual nature of the post-pandemic economy: Inflation is hammering household budgets, forcing consumers to pull back on spending, and growth is weakening, heightening fears the [economy could fall into recession](https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-business-layoffs-prices-f899b5d7e989fbe748c4ff49e2ed6096). Yet companies are still scrambling to add workers. Demand has been particularly strong in travel- and entertainment-related services.

“*This is not what a recession looks like,” said Nick Bunker, director of economic research at employment website Indeed's Hiring Lab. “Clouds can move in quickly and darken the outlook for the U.S. labor market, but for now, the sun is still shining.*”

Americans are also far more likely to quit their jobs than before the pandemic, mostly for new jobs at higher pay, another trend that is pushing up incomes. The number of people quitting fell to 4.3 million in May, down about 60,000 from April and below a record 4.5 million last November, but still historically high.

Economists are closely monitoring the jobs opening figures for signs the labor market is cooling, which could bring down inflation. With companies posting so many available positions, they have also been raising pay and offering more benefits to attract and keep workers. Higher labor costs have, in turn, contributed to pushing up prices, with [inflation now at 40-year highs](https://apnews.com/article/key-inflation-report-highest-level-in-four-decades-c0248c5b5705cd1523d3dab3771983b4).

The Federal Reserve has targeted the nearly record-high job openings as evidence that the economy has overheated, and [is rapidly lifting the short-term interest rate](https://apnews.com/article/fed-interest-rates-inflation-be1b698e48327d3a33847be25aba3e3d) it controls to cool consumer and business spending. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hopes that weaker spending will reduce demand for workers, lower job openings and wage increases, and bring down inflation.

For now, labor demand remains strong. Last month, the government said that [employers added 390,000 jobs in May,](https://apnews.com/article/us-economy-jobs-report-493e18e85978b9655766ef3129d8d4f8) a healthy increase, while the unemployment rate stayed at 3.6%, near a 50-year low.

There are signs that hiring and the demand for labor may cool in the coming months. On Friday, the June jobs report is expected to show that employers added 275,000 jobs, which would be a solid increase but the smallest in more than a year.  And Homebase, a company that provides payroll and hiring software for small businesses, says it has seen a 16% drop in new job postings by its customers in June compared with May. A separate survey of 400 of its clients finds that while most plan to add jobs this year, the proportion who say they won’t add jobs has doubled to 8% in June compared with January of this year. And the proportion who plan to add more than 11 workers has fallen sharply, to nearly 19%, down from 30% in January.

And a survey of executives at manufacturing firms found that last month new orders actually declined compared with May, as Americans cut back their spending on manufactured goods.

personalfinance,Am I required to file a state return (NY) if I'd just be getting it back?,"Hello, trying to figure out if I need to file a state return for where I was a non-resident working student. 

NY state withheld $12 from my student employment earnings last year. I earned ~2000 (3100 is standard deduction), so I'd receive that all back, but filing through the tax software I used would cost me $14. Will NY state care I don't file to claim back $12? I requested an extension in April that goes until July 15th. If NY state permitted paper filing, I would just sit down and fill it out, but they seem to do everything to force you to e-file, which would mean recompleting all the info via a free file refferal link. My Federal and other taxes were already submitted back in May. Federal government gave it all back plus American Opportunity Credit. Home state (MD) wanted more.

Basically, my question is, should I worry about filing with NY state and recompleting all the software, or since they would owe me money, can I just ignore it.",finance,1657125757

He invested the money purely in corporate bonds, keeping the maturity of the bonds short at around 1-3 years.  Whenever a bond matures, he will reinvest the proceeds in the same rolling maturity profile.  He's been buying bonds in the secondary market, and generally pays a premium above par.  Average yield-to-maturity is around 2.5% - 3.0%, and average coupon payment is roughly the same.

Fast forward to this year, with interest rates rising, the fixed income market got crush.  Because of his short duration, he did a little better than the overall bond market.  I was helping him tabulate his account, and saw that he has about $955,000 in par value that he will get back at maturity.

personalfinance,New used car I bought for 16K now costing me 10K in repairs.,"So my old car I (30F) had for 6 years broke down it needed a new transmission. My BF and aunt encouraged me to look into a newer used car from a dealer. Which meant taking out a car loan for the first time. I didn’t want to do that but I trusted them.

I got a 2014 fait 500L from a drivetime. BF helped me search for it. It has less than 44k miles and the carfax is clean. It drove great. I bought it May 20th.

The dealership gave me 5 days to return and a 30 day warranty.

I had surgery after buying it so I wasn’t able to drive for a week. When I was finally able, the car wouldn’t move it. It would start and not go anywhere. After towing 5 times to different places and calling many others, we ran out of time on the warranty and found out the transmission on this car is also out. On top of that not many places can work on it because it needs to be programmed.


As of now I currently have:

Brokerage account: 11k

TSP: 7k

Money Market: 2k (pretty much drained from the pandemic)

I have 23k in fed student loans, some medical debt and now 15k auto loan through my bank with a 5.6 interest rate.

I figured there isn’t much I can do legally at this point but financially I feel doomed and could really use some advice. 

TL;DR : I paid 16k for a new used car. After a week of owning it it stopped working. I need a new transmission that will cost 10k all together. I feel financially screwed. I can’t afford it.",finance,1657128731

vet,"I found a starved, jaundiced kitten. I can't afford the vet, what do I do?","PHOTOS HERE [https://imgur.com/a/9YCaW8u](https://imgur.com/a/9YCaW8u) 

Hi. I found a very sick little black kitten Saturday night. I'm in southeast Georgia. Fleas and ticks are a nightmare here during the summer. I coaxed her in and picked her right up and took her home. This is day 4 of caring for her. Approximately 7, maybe 8 months old. No more than 4 or 5 pounds. Clearly never been taken care of by any people. She was dirty, covered in fleas and all skin and bones. I gave her a bath and I noticed  she was oozing a brown-red liquid, which someone told me was probably old blood from fleas. I also noticed intense jaundice all over her skin, ears, tongue and mouth. her voice was so dry and raspy and she could hardly meow, it was more of a croak. I thought perhaps it was a lung infection, but she sounds less hoarse now that she's been drinking water, so hopefully it was just dehydration and not an infection? Her skin also seems less yellow today, and there's no more old blood oozing. 

ANYWAYS, I know this is not an alternative to medical attention, but I cannot afford to take her to a vet at the moment. The shelters, humane society, and animal services in town are of no use, they are overrun, underfunded and understaffed. My city has a uniquely bad stray/feral cat issue so I am not surprised they're unable to help at all. I just really need some advice on what to do. On the phone the Humane society recommended taking her to animal control and euthanizing her. I just hung up because I am not letting that happen, this little kitten has a fighting chance. She's getting stronger and I really hope the jaundice will diminish.

I have a cat and a dog at home, and I am worried to even bring her into my apartment, so I made her a make-shift cardboard home (with litter box included) to keep her sequestered from my pets. If she survives and doesn't have any contagious diseases that could hurt my pets, I am going to keep her!!

personalfinance,Buying my Parent's House: Gift of Equity or Rent-To-Buy,"**Quick background:** My parents are retiring soon. My mom wants to retire this year and move to their house in Florida, my dad on the other hand isn't retiring till 2024 when he can collect his pension. With that, I've been given the opportunity to move back across the country and buy my parents house. While this is moving a bit quicker than I expected, I know full well that this will be my only real opportunity at homeownership in the near future due to the insane COL where I currently live. It also helps that the area my parents live is fast growing, not far from the city, and I know exactly what kind of house im getting (roof was replaced this year). So now I need to figure out if this is doable for me, otherwise they're going to sell the home. 

So my partner and I are tentively planning the move to New York in 2024 to take over the home, the question is figuring out how we're going to do it that's both affordable and attainable for us, since we can't afford a meaningful downpayment. I'll be visiting my parents later this year where I plan to hash out the details some more.

The way I see it is that theres two options my parents and I briefly discussed: Rent To *Own or Gift of Equity.

**Gift of Equity**

On the surface this seems like the easiest and best way to get this done. From what I understand a GOE would work as follows:

My parents home was valued around 350K (probably around 400K by the time we move), we would set a 'gift' of 70K which would act as a 20% down payemnt for the house. My parents walk away 280K, wipe their hands clean, and retire. 

NY does not have a gift tax so thats one less con to worry about, however AFAIK there is still federal gift/estate tax to factor in, the details of that im not sure. 

**Rent-To-Own**

This option was recommended by my parents. From what I understand, my partner and I would enter into a contract to rent the house for a set amount of time. At the end of that contract we're given the option to buy the house, with the money we spent on monthly rent acting as the downpayment when the time comes (i think?). 

This would give my partner and I time to live in the house and be certain that this is for us, which is a positive. My parents would probably make out with more money by the end of things it would seem, but this looks like it would be a much lengthier and more expensive option for myself. 

I'm personally leaning towards GOE since it seems more appealing from my side, but maybe less so for my parents. Is there anything im missing or other details to consider? What is the better route to go with?

Thank you",finance,1657144718

Fortunately we were able to put a good chunk down for both and have a great interest rate on both vehicles. We don't owe too much on them (have been making extra payments for the entirety of the loan payment up to this point so regardless we'd be paying them off earlier than obligated - no early payoff penalties on either loan).

We have been saving a lot over the last couple of years as well and my goal for the end of this year was to save enough in liquid funds to cover the outstanding car balances. We should be able to hit that goal in the next couple of months but obviously the payoff is sort of a sticker shock.

Should we actually pay them off early, or is it more important, especially in current market conditions and where we are starting to head economically, to be more liquid? This particular savings account is entirely separate from our emergency funds so it's literally an account for either 1. Paying off the cars 2. Just saving more and building liquidity and wealth and continuing to pay down the cars as we have been.

I personally work in a pretty volatile industry and could very well be laid off in the next 4-5 months with difficulty finding another job within the same industry. Honestly could struggle to find another job just generally depending on how things go since they never go according to plan! Or I could retain my job just fine and nothing happens at all. Who knows?

Is it worth paying the vehicles off early to free up that space in the budget going forward and save that amount or is it more beneficial to have the liquid funds available in addition to emergency for the ""what if"" situation and just continue adding to that savings as much as possible?

**TL;DR**: Have auto loans. Saving enough liquid funds to cover the balances. Should we pay them off early or retain the liquidity since vehicles are depreciating (generally) anyways?",finance,1657159190

12. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
13. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

15. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources. It’s been obvious this was coming for a while ever since the reports of mining operations dumping hot waste water into the finger lakes and affecting the ecology.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto has no real world utility,"I used to be a small gambler of crypto, 2-3k at most. I made a decent profit and got out several months ago. I am so happy I did that. I am a Senior college student studying Computer Science.

**EDIT: Thanks for the comments so far. I'm not trying to be a dick but I'm just posting my monkey brain concerns with crypto in hopes I will get some interesting comments to look into why I am wrong.  Cunningham's Law states ""the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."" Not saying I'm wrong but yeah. I am fascinated by the technology but I just really don't see the average person ever using it.**

Crypto will never be used like many of you believe. It just won't. Let me outline my main reasons why:

1. Not every day friendly
   1. The average Joe or Jane has no use case for crypto. The learning curve is too steep and there are better options to use out there. Let's say Jane is having a party and wants all her girlfriends to pay her for drinks. In order for it to be crypto based, it would require all of them to have an exchange on their phone. Then if the volatility of the market hasn't drained their accounts, they can send money to Jane. But maybe a few of them are using ADA, some are using BTC, some ETH. Jane would then have to send her Wallet address for each of those accounts to the specific friends that have those accounts. Then each of them would have to copy and paste that address to send coins (relative to some USD value) to Jane. At this point why wouldn't the girls just use Venmo to do this.
2. Gas fees, transfer fees, hidden fees, etc
   1. Venmo is free to use. However, in my experience with crypto I have lost around 10% of my crypto everytime just from transferring between accounts and the whole buying/selling process. I don't see why I would again go out of my way to do something harder that is going to cost extra money when Venmo or other USD transfer services exist. Venmo is also instantaneous, crypto is not.
3. It is gambling. No one wants to actually own it
   1. No one wants to actually own crypto besides the OG users who are in it for the actual dream behind decentralization and web3 technology (which is even stupider among NFTS). It is not an investment. You are gambling. The volatility of crypto shows that there will never be a stabilization of coins. Even the ones that were supposed to be stable like Tether or Luna have plummeted and IDGAF what your reasoning is at the end of the day people lost hundreds of thousands on something that is unregulated. Not to mention Bitcoin, ADA, ETH and every other coin out there is down by half its value since last year. There is no company that is backing the value of a currency. The only reason people want crypto, is in the hope it increases in perceived value and they can trade it away for United States Dollars. That itself is the counter argument for cryptos existence. It is all still in relation to the USD and always will be unless the United States Government collapses which it wont. But to entertain the idea that it did one day, do you really think the internet would still be around if the fucking United States Government was gone? Crypto works on server farms and old computers in garages. One major outage and everyone and their mother is a broke bastard. Even the corporations that have started accepting crypto or had done so in the past only did it to trade it back for USD in the end or whatever their government backed currency is. And I'm not saying that crypto won't increase in value in the future or grow as a whole. I just don't see the future average person adopting crypto as an everyday currency.
4. Insurance, hacks, fraud, no government
   1. If your crypto is stolen, it is gone. There is a very slim chance you will get your crypto back. Even if you have a cold wallet hackers can still find ways to access it with keyloggers and such. Even going to an exchange such as Coinbase won't do you any good. I've read multiple accounts on reddit from people loosing over 10k in crypto and going to Coinbase support because their account was hacked and guess what? THEY WERE NEVER REFUNDED. This is not to mention hacks that happen to entire networks themselves such as these [600 million dollar ones](https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cybersecurity/biggest-cryptocurrency-hacks-of-all-time). The only way people get their money back in those cases is through the will of the hacker that stole their money. Take a look at the mess of LUNA too! Insane amounts of money stolen from users in a rugpull like scenario. And who can all of these people go to for help? No. One. There is no Paypal. There is no Chase bank. There is no Discover credit card. There is NO ONE. Sure you can contact the exchange you were using but they can only help get your account back. They don't have any policies in place to refund your crypto. from the [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured) website itself: ""**our policy does not cover any losses resulting from unauthorized access to your personal Coinbase or Coinbase Pro account(s) due to a breach or loss of your credentials"".**
   2. Here is [one example](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/owgc18/all_of_my_crypto_was_stolen/) of someone being hacked on Coinbase and loosing their money due to the hacker using a Sim Swap and gaining access to their phone number. Coinbase likely did not refund them as per their policy but had it been a bank account they sure would have. Here is [another example](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/rrsvk6/all_my_crypto_assets_are_stolen/) of a cold wallet one where where a user lost $17,500. Although yes it is their faut they were storing an image of their 25 words phrase on their PC, it is tragic that this happened to them. How many of us have older parents or grandparents that could have easily done the same thing? You can't just call the person stupid for doing such a thing because these security protocols are so new that the average Joe doesn't understand them and never will take the time to. BuT tHeN hE sHoUlDn'T bE uSInG CrYPto. EXACTLY. THE AVERAGE PERSON SHOULDNT AND WONT BECAUSE THEY WILL GET BURNED LIKE THIS EVENTUALLY. In the few months that I was gambling crypto I had probably around 100 legit looking attempts to scam me whether it was popups, emails, reddit fake support, phone calls, etc. And also yes I was able to identity them and be safe not everyone is able to.
   3. I am incredibly grateful that I no longer own and crypto currency for this exact reason. A few weeks ago my computer was hacked by a trojan virus and they got access to my password manager. They were somehow able to bypass my 2FA authentication. A bunch of my financial accounts were hacked including my Paypal, bank account, ebay, steam, etc. In total over $4000 was set to be taken from my accounts. I immediately hopped on support calls with my bank account, paypal, ebay, etc and was able to freeze all of my accounts and begin an investigation into the transactions. About 1 week after the attempt, all of my assets have been returned to me through the support of these amazing corporations. Hell yes they are centralized too! I love that man. Give me a corporation to call that is backed by the Government to help me recover my assets. Did you know that banks in America insure users for up to $250,000 guaranteed by the FDIC. It's called [Deposit Insurance](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/brochures/deposits-at-a-glance/). Now compare that to the statement from coinbase above and below. Yikes.
   4. From the same [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/legal-policies/how-is-coinbase-insured) website as before ""**Cryptocurrency is not legal tender and is not backed by the government. Cryptocurrency is not insured or guaranteed by the subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).**"" You want the government to not be involved? You want to be untraceable, unregulated? The government says OKAY LOL. Have fun playing with the people who lurk in those uncharted waters. Many of them even pose as support for exchanges to try to help victims recover assets. But then they end up scamming the victim again and stealing their assets.",cryptocurrency,1657176772

stocks,(7/7) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, July the 7th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures are higher following third straight day of gains for the S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were slightly higher on Thursday morning as Wall Street looked to build on a modest winning streak.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked up by 98 points, or 0.32%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.23% and 0.32%, respectively. The S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday posted its first 3-day winning streak since late May. The benchmark is on pace for its second positive week in 3 and now sits about 20% off its record high.
*****
&gt; Chipmakers were higher in premarket trading after South Korea’s Samsung posted an 11% jump in profit and 21% surge in revenue for the latest period on strong sales of memory chips. Shares of Micron, AMD and Nvidia were all higher in premarket trading by more than 1%.
*****
&gt; Another notable early mover was GameStop, which popped 9% in premarket trading after the video game retailer said a 4-for-1 stock split was approved by its board. Shareholders at the market close on July 18 will get a dividend of three additional shares for each of GameStop’s Class A common stock, the retailer said. The dividend will be distributed after trading closes on July 21.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 posted its third straight day of gains following the release of the June meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve. The broader market index added nearly 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained more than 69 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite rose close to 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Central bank officials reiterated a tough stance against inflation, saying another 50- or 75-basis point move would “likely be appropriate” at the July 26-27 meeting.
*****
&gt; Still, many investors found it challenging to trust those gains as recession concerns continue to loom on Wall Street, and as market participants looked ahead to what many expect will be a volatile earnings season this month.
*****
&gt; “Everybody is both emotionally and sort of market level exhausted,” Alli McCartney, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “So, I think we still have a summer of watching for what the Fed does, watching for what happens in international policy, watching for the directionality of CPI.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders will parse through the latest reports on weekly jobless claims and international trade that are due out Thursday before the bell. The Labor Department’s official jobs report is due out on Friday.
*****
&gt; “With anecdotes of Tech sector layoffs and hiring freezes, sub-50 readings in the Employment
Components of the most recent ISM Manufacturing and Services surveys, and rising unemployment claims (albeit from extremely low levels), Friday’s Jobs report will hold particular significance,” Credit Suisse chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Levi Strauss is set to report earnings Thursday after the bell.

 July 7 (Reuters) - A pullback in the dollar offered the euro some respite, allowing it to edge away from two-decade lows reached this week after surging energy prices fanned recession fears.

Risky assets, including the euro, managed gradual gains on Thursday as investors grappled with the risks of a recession and a potential pause in interest rate hikes.

CryptoCurrency,Celsius have closed their Maker Vault and are about to dump 22k BTC (500m USD) on the market,"Celsius onchain activity has seen a lot of big moves in the last few hours.

They closed down their maker vault by replaying the loan and retaken their 22k BTC from there And now have consolidated the 22k BTC into an intermediary wallet, and this is moving to FTX.

&amp;#x200B;

[DAI loan closed](https://preview.redd.it/orxfnagob5a91.jpg?width=1412&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40b790b7b912b73f2636954245918416f10dc095)

It doesnt look like they have an OTC deal in place, so they are instead moving all of that to their FTX deposit wallet

After fucking up so epicly in the last 2 months, its atleast encouraging to see them do a test transaction of 0.01 BTC..

It looks like a big liquidation is underway in Celsius and they may also be declaring bankruptcy and announcing insolvency proceedings soon

DeFiyst has been tracking every move!

**Update: the $500m BTC is still in Celsius' main wallet here and hasnt yet been moved to FTX:**  https://etherscan.io/address/0x019C4935ff1c4945f046c6784c08a40f1ab632a3

They haven't yet moved this stack of 24.4k BTC to the FTX wallet. Since they moved the test 0.001 BTC, its speculated that they may move this too shortly.

If you check the wallet's erc20 txn tab, you can see that they have moved a lot of their tokens like ZRX, BNT, Comp etc to their main FTX wallet, probably to sell it. 

Now the wallet mainly has 24,400 wBTC ($511,000,000) + some Comp worth 50k

**Update 2:**

The wBTC just moved...  https://etherscan.io/tx/0x84a4bd54e9ce7d322544a0a8110232b37eb3bb4b1a486835891b6213a43fda56

Half a Bil transacted with a fee of $1.7.. Sent straight to FTX. Lets see what unfolds now

**Additional update:**

Celsius just got sued by another company KeyFi who claim Celsius lied about hedging impermanent loss risk, and that alone contributed to a big hole in Celsius balance sheet. 

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=RvF30Mz2IZW63s1mjjau2Q==

Lawsuit claims:

&gt; But in late Feb 2021, we discovered Celsius had lied to us. They had not been hedging our activities, nor had they been hedging the fluctuations in cryptoasset prices. The entire company’s portfolio had naked exposure to the market.

&gt; After seeing these (and other) major problems in how the company operated, we informed Celsius that we wished to terminate our relationship. That was March 2021. We told Celsius that we would work with them to unwind our various positions over the following months.

Oof Celsius never hedged IL from their defi activities. They may have been insolvent long ago

&gt; ""Faced with a liquidity crisis, Celsius began to offer double-digit interest rates in order to lure new depositors, whose funds were used to repay earlier depositors and creditors.""

&gt; 91. After Stone left Celsius KeyFi, Celsius maintained access and control of the 0xb1 wallet. Celsius’ CEO, Alex Mashinsky, used that control for his own personal benefit. In one example, Celsius’ CEO transferred valuable NFTs from the 0xb1 accounts to his wife’s wallet.",cryptocurrency,1657199802
economy,Economic Outlook?,"What is everyone's current economic outlook? I should really say what everyone's FED outlook is considering over 40% of our GDP is government spending and the FED has a stronghold over most markets. Personally I think the FED needs to continue the tightening at least until next year to reset all of the leveraged firms and the shady practices. Warren Buffet once said when the tide goes out we can see who has been swimming naked and the tide hasn't gone out since 2008 so I feel like it is time for a reset especially with all the money printing that went on during the pandemic. As of March 2022, COVID costs totaled ~6 trillion. World War II cost $4.7 trillion in today's dollars. All the money printing totaled around ~13.5 trillion; $6 trillion for COVID + $4.5 trillion for quantitative easing + $3 trillion for infrastructure. The next CPI print is July 15th and then the meeting is July 26th, both of which will be very telling for our future economic state. I just hope they don’t let off the brakes too quickly because of midterms coming up or that could ruin the dollar which is America's best asset and lead us to a crack up boom. Curious to see peoples perspectives on the current economic state and what the FED will do from here.",finance,1657200026
defi,Why no one is talking (and investing) about oracles?!,"As everyone might know, oracles are an important piece of crypto space with multiple uses in terms of linking and translate DATA from one protocol to another in order for them to ""speak"", but on the DeFi space either with centralized or decentralized exchanges (CEX / DEX) and Automated Market Makers (AMM) its use is completely crucial!

I understand that we are on a bear market and generally the price of every single asset dropped quite a lot, but the price of LINK (biggest oracle) is now way lower than it was 2 years ago! How is this even possible?! Specially when it didn't happen to big and small other coins... I've been buying it every month as soon as it went under $20, but to be honest I'm starting to second guess myself, that's why I'd appreciate some input on this in case I'm missing something!  


By one hand I can see the growth of many oracle ecosystems such as Dia, Band or Graph, and it's price isn't really picking up, which I understand because we are on a bear market and it's fair enough.

I also understand that the focus of oracles is growing it's use and expand it's ecosystem and just after focus on monetizing, following the suit of many tech stock (Amazon, Testa, Uber, etc), and I also understand that the rising interest rates can be quite harmful for ""non profitable"" companies, as so for  crypto.  
But...

personalfinance,23yo ~ 60K high interest debt,"Allow me to skip the sob story and admit that I’ve irresponsibly drowned myself in debt over the course of the last few years. I’ve been sorting out my finances trying to get on track to pay this up as aggressively as possible. My goal with this post is to hopefully find a better approach than my current thoughts.

This is what it breaks down to:
Total CC debt (avg 22-24% APR) - $31,254

CC debt currently in 0% balance transfer cards $2425/16mo left, $4796/10Mo left

This leaves $24,033 Currently exposed to interest.

Loans: 
Originally 26k, 27.42% APR, 60mo 
~ Min payment $800.42 - 
Current Balance is $23,279.77 56months left.

5k loan 19.90% APR, 38 bi-weekly, Minimum $155 — 
Current balance is 5k W/38payments left

Totaling a whopping 59.5k, bye bye early 20’s! Hope it was worth it :) 

Income: 90k Salary W/optional OT@1.5x rate (None income tax state)

Base Monthly expense - $3445
This total includes my minimum payments for both loans mentioned above, but does not include food/gas which I figure put me at around $4000
Monthly.

My optional OT gives me the ability to work up to an extra 20 hours/week

I did some math and figured this would be my take home pay at various hours after roughly 25% federal tax, Yw uncle sam!

Min (1hr OT/day)
$6165 / Mo

Mid (2Hrs)
$7139

Max (3 Hrs + Weekend shift)
$9086, While I’d love to consistently do this, I don’t think I could and maintain acceptable mental health 🤣

I can easily maintain the $7100 range with an occasional pop into the 8’s most likely.

Finally my current approach is to maintain minimums on the loan balances while throwing whats left of my monthly income at CC’s ($3463avg based on figures above) It would take roughly 8 months figuring added interest to clear the 24k of interest exposed  CC debt.

After this, attack the loan balances while taking advantage of the remaining 2 and 8 months on 0% balance transfers mentioned. 

Once those start accruing interest split the payments equally and don’t fuck up  again (Lets hope).

Am I going at this correctly? Are there any other options I can take to lower interest maybe?

personalfinance,"Should I eliminate a car loan, or save for a down payment?","Hello,

I've been living with a parent the last few years to pay down some debt and make myself more financially stable. Covid gave me the opportunity to change careers into something more lucrative and I've used those funds to pay off most of my student loan debt and some medical debt that's been stalking me.

I'm to the point in my life where I can finally contemplate buying my own home with out immediately having to dismiss it as a pipe dream for people with money. I was thinking of giving myself a year, or maybe two years time frame to find a house, and move out.

My chiefest debts right now are my car payment and my federal student loan ( I pay cellphone, car insurance, etc. it's just those two are the biggest bills)  . The student loan may or may not be forgiven, and the amount I still owe on my car is enough that I could probably get it paid off completely in a year or so.  That having been said I've been wondering if it would be a better idea to save money for a down payment on a place ( when I find one) or to use that money to pay off my car and thereby better increasing my debt to income ratio.

A better DTI would make me more attractive for a mortgage, but I have a pretty  good credit score and a set price range for what I'm willing to pay for a home. I'm not looking to necessarily get more financing, and I wouldn't see any real benefits from the lack of car payment as I'd just be replacing it with a mortgage. On the other hand, I know that having some down payment is better than no down payment because you already go in with equity in the home.

Any tips? Should I maybe make a big payment on the car loan and refinance for a smaller monthly payment? That way I can still start to save? Or should I go all in on the down payment option?",finance,1657204314

investing,Nonfarm payrolls impact on stocks in an inflationary environment,"I am curious how people think the market will react to tomorrow's NFP release. In a normal environment (generally), higher than expected NFPs lead a stronger dollar and stronger market because it shows a growing economy. For the dollar, this means interest rate hikes are more probable than previously priced in as well as demand for dollars. For the market, this means more people have jobs, so there's more purchasing power, so earnings will be stronger than was priced in. 

HOWEVER, today's environment is different because of inflation and stagflation fears. For the dollar it's still pretty straightforward - higher NFPs = stronger underlying economy, lower stagflation fears, and more likelihood that the Fed will be able to raise rates, so it's bullish for the dollar (and vice versa for if NFPs are lower). 

The market, however, is much more complicated. On one hand, if NFPs are higher it means that the underlying economy is stronger than priced in since consumers have more money to spend (so earnings could be higher). BUT, at the same time it means that the Fed will be able to continue hiking interest rates since the labor market is still strong (a lot of people have been talking about a Fed pause in late 2022 due to a weakening economy). This is where my confusion lies. 

In essence my question is: if NFPs are stronger than expected, which one will drive the **stock** market more: the fact that interest rates are likely to be higher for longer than priced in or the fact that the labor market and underlying economy are stronger than priced in?

&gt; Buyers are getting a slight reprieve from this year’s massive rise in rates that has started to cool parts of the US housing market. The jump in costs has pushed more buyers out of the real estate hunt, causing inventory to increase. Sellers have started to cut prices in certain areas.

personalfinance,US Income Tax question,"Hi everyone, I am hoping some people may be able to help me understand my payroll taxes a bit. I have a good understanding of personal finances and I have never really paid much attention to income taxes in regards to what bracket my wife and I are in, etc and just took it as it is what it is. What I am hoping for is someone can offer some clarity on why my with holding on my payroll has changed so drastically recently. Here is some info:

Last year, between my wife and I, we grossed around $170,000 with my pay being about $105,000 of that. My pay is broken into salary and bonuses. My wife's pay is all salary. Last year, we ended up owning like $4500 on our Federal tax. Our state, local and school taxes were all pretty close to what was withheld ... owed on a couple and got a refund back on a couple. It's just my wife and I (no kids)

Being that we owed so much money last year (I say so much because I was anticipating a return of a few grand so it was, mentally, a $7500 swing in finances) I, recently, had my payroll company withhold $15 more per pay period. This wouldn't take care of the $4500 again but I figured it would be a little bit and, as I get more bonuses, I would put some of that money in an account to be used on taxes if we owed again this year. My gross pay was $2270 ($59,020 annual) and my net worked out to be $1815. After the $15 extra withholding, that dropped my net pay to $1800. 

I have recently gotten a 2% raise and a bonus in a short period of time (both happened between a pay period). With my 2% raise, that took my gross pay to $2315 ($60,200 annual). I figured such a small raise wouldn't really affect my taxes too much and thought my net pay would be about $1845 ... maybe a little less because there would be incrementally more taxes with held.  When I received my pay, the net pay was only $1785 (this includes the extra $15 that is being withheld) ... so it actually went down lower than what my net pay was prior to my 2% raise. 

As I mentioned, at the same time, I had received a bonus as well. This is my 2nd bonus of the year. My first bonus was issued in February. The gross pay was $11,905 and my net was $8010. This worked out to about 33% of my pay being with held for the various taxes, social security, medicare, etc. My most recent bonus gross was $22,335. Using the simple math of 33% going to withholdings, I was thinking that this bonus would net about $15,000. On my pay stub, the net ended up being $12,300. This works out to about 45% of it being withheld. 

Can anyone help me understand where the differences are coming in? My initial thought is with how much is being withheld, we would probably end up getting a return this year instead of owing again? I will end up with about $36,000 more in bonuses this year so I anticipate making about $130,000. With my wife's pay, we will be close to $200,000 earned this year. Does it seem logical that we would be in better shape at tax time this year?

personalfinance,What percent of e-fund is ok in CD's?,"I have $20k set aside as an emergency fund which represents approximately 6 months of living expenses for me.  Currently it resides in a savings account at a credit union where the interest rate is 0.1%.  I have used Discover Bank in the past, and they are currently offering 1.1% on savings accounts and 1.9% on 12 month CDs, so I am going to move my e-fund over there so it can earn more.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: is there a rule of thumb for how much of your emergency fund can sit in CD's vs a more liquid savings account?

&amp;#x200B;

I consider both types of accounts to be safe, the obvious CD pro is the higher interest rate, and the obvious con is the money is less available compared to a savings account.  Although, in a true emergency one can always break the CD and just take the loss of interest, so that's not much of a con in my eyes.  I would likely create a rotation of 4 or 6 CD's so that money is maturing every 2 or 3 months to get a slight increase in liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional facts which might affect answers-

• I also have about 12k in savings which is meant for spending- vacations, car down payment, other expensive purchases.  That balance can fluctuate, but anything there would be available in an emergency.

• I have just over $70k invested in stocks, which can also fluctuate in value, but would be available in a truly dire situation.

• My home, auto and medical insurance is all up to date and provides good coverage.  My wife and I also live fairly risk averse lives.

• I am on track with my tax sheltered retirement accounts &amp; retirement plans.

• My job, company and industry are all stable.  I do not expect to find myself unemployed anytime in the near future.

• In short, there are no impending signs that I'm aware of that would cause me to need my e-fund (although I get it- emergency is right there in the name).",finance,1657211729
personalfinance,Budget Suggestions Please!,"Long time lurker but first time poster. My fiancé (29m) and I (27f) are looking to buy a house within the next year and have the opportunity to live at home and not pay rent for awhile. I’m used to living paycheck to paycheck and I’m not quite sure how to allocate the extra funds that will no longer go to rent and utility bills. We will both be contributing to home savings, but I will be strictly focusing on just my budget below. 

I’m paid on a monthly basis and my take home pay after taxes and 8% 401k/Roth is $3400. The only bills I will have to pay starting this month are listed below:

- Student Loans: $220 (paused but paying since there is no interest, $21k left)
- Car Loan: $323 payment ($10.5k left)
- Car Insurance: $170
- Phone: $55
- subscriptions: $60

Variable expenses (rough estimates):
- Gas: $120
- Groceries: $100 (FMIL will still continue purchasing most of them - she’s amazing!)
- Other: $400 (eating out, date nights, concerts, etc.)

After those expenses I’m left with close to $1950 to save a month. I have several different savings buckets and would also like to tackle some of my debt during this time period. Here’s what I was thinking below for a budget but would like some critiquing:

- Joint Home Savings: $700 (have 16k currently saved up)
- Individual home savings: $250 (money I plan to save for any new furniture or home improvements that pop up early on)
- Emergency Fund: $200 (currently have 5k)
- Wedding: $200 
- Retirement Savings for Parents: $100 
- Short-Term Savings: $100

After this I would have $400 left and was planning to split that between my car loan and student loans. I don’t have any credit card debt and only put gas, groceries and gifts on there and then pay off immediately. I also have a PT job that I usually make an additional $400 - $500 from a month. I’ve been using this money towards the wedding savings and stocks/index funds and travel money. 

My parents have awful financial literacy and I never learned how to properly save/budget for big purchases and life events. I am open to any advice or suggestions. I live in a big city on the East Coast that has a fairly HCOL and want to make sure I am setting myself up to be a successful homeowner especially with the rising interest rates. My credit score is 772 and don’t necessarily want to payoff any of my open lines of credit before purchasing the house.

personalfinance,What does an interest rate mean on a savings account?,"Hi y’all! I’m new to personal finances so I wanted some insight on this. 

I began a savings account through my company about a year ago starting off with a small amount of $1,200. I contribute $50 a paycheck (bi monthly) until I can afford to contribute more. 

I receive emails about my interest rate increasing every so often, but up until now I haven’t paid attention to what it means. The latest increase is 1.045% meaning I get like $1.65 in my account a month. But I have no idea what that means? Why do savings accounts have an interest? If I have to take money out of it, will it be deducted? Do I have to pay this back? My only experience with interest is with credit cards, which is money I have to pay back, so how does it work with a savings account?

investing,Negative compounding interest equal to positve simple interest - what does it mean?,"I was trying to find equivalences of some simple returns to what would the interest rate be if they were compounded in different frequencies over the same period and I realized the equations (I.e. this compound interest - the simple interest should be 0 for the rates to be equivalent) have negative valid roots often (or complex, but I don't wanna go there even).

That doesn't make a lot of sense because negative interest rates won't ever compound to positive returns, so I was wondering if this has any kind of financial interpretation.

The calculation:

So, the formula for compound interest is `A = P (r/n + 1)^(tn)`

Imagine you have a total capital after investment A'. The equivalent compound interest you can calculate by doing `A' = A = P(r/n + 1)^(tn)`. Which you can calculate by filling in the data and calculating the roots where

    P(r/n + 1)^(tn) - A' = 0

To give you an example. I invest 10000€ and when I close that investment I have 11000€, say after 5 years. I want to calculate how much yearly compound every month interest is that, so I solve for r:

    10000 * (r / 12 + 1) ^ (5 * 12) - 11000 = 0

That's a degree 60 polynomial equation, so it has 60 different solutions. Most of them complex. But you can substitute for `c = 0.0190` or `c = -24.0191` to see that both give you a solution to the equation.

So apparently -2400% interest rates are equal to a 10% return in 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it's been years since I've invested anything else. I'm not sure I want to go through them again because lots of people in my life say it's unnecessary and wastes money when I can invest myself.

stocks,Stock analysis and valuation of Disney - The wounded giant is recovering $DIS,"Disney is one of the largest brands out there and the company has been seen as one with a moat for a very long time. 

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals and provide insights into the business fundamentals, financials as well as valuation. Feel free to disagree with the analysis and share your views. 

***Let's get started!***

&amp;#x200B;

**Share price performance &amp; dividends**

If we take a look at the last 5 years, the performance isn't great, down 7%, way below the S&amp;P500 performance. Up until mid-2020, the company was a dividend-payer, so if we take the dividends into account, the return would be close to -2%. As of mid-2020, due to the pandemic, they've decided to change their dividend policy and stop paying dividends. In case the company decides to go back to paying dividends, the yield would be somewhere around 2% (based on the current share price).

&amp;#x200B;

**The two main divisions**

The company is currently organized into two divisions and understanding each one is important before we can make any rational/informed assumptions about the future.

**Disney media &amp; entertainment distribution - Division #1**

This is their largest division contribution almost 70% of the total revenue. It grew from a bit over $30b in the financial year 2017\* to over $50b in the last twelve months ending March 2022.

*\*Disney's financial years end in September and start in October the year before.* 

However, in the same time, the operating margin of the division is down from 30% to 10%. To better understand that, we need to go one layer deeper. This division has three main segments

**a) Linear Networks** (ABC, Disney, ESPN, National Geographic, Star) with an average operating margin of 31% in the last 5 years

**b) Direct-to-consumer** (Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, Star+) with an average operating margin of -17% in the last 5 years

**c) Content sales/Licensing** (theatrical distribution, home entertainment (DVD/Blu-ray), Music distribution) with an average operating margin of 30% in the last 5 years

Now, we all know the streaming war going on with Netflix and Amazon Prime and Apple Plus TV, and Disney/Hulu. Direct-to-consumer stream is the reason behind the decrease in the operating margin of this segment. It has grown significantly in the last 4 years and since it has a negative operating margin, it brings down the margin of the entire division. Of course, the margin has been improving over time.

So, what can we expect from this division in the long run? The Linear Networks and the Content sales/licensing are both relatively mature segments with limited growth ahead, but high margins. The direct-to-consumer is high growth in terms of revenue, but the margin is yet to catch up. Looking into all the competitors, I don't see any chance that the operating margin gets anywhere close to the 30%. So in my forecast, I feel comfortable using a 25% long-term operating margin. What this means is I'm starting with the 10% and slowly increasing that over time.

**Disney parks, experiences, and products - Division #2**

This division contributes the remaining 30% of the revenue and it is related to the theme parks (Florida, California, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai), Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club, National geographic expeditions, Disney resort, and spa. Not only that, but here is also the revenue that Disney earns by licensing trade names, characters, visuals, and other IP to manufacturers, game developers, and publishers, as well as the sale of branded merchandise.

This is the division that got impacted significantly in 2020. The revenue went from $23b in 2017 to $26b in 2019 down to $17b in 2020 and $16.5b in 2021. Not only that, but the margins went down from 24-25% to under 3%.

As the world is going back to normal, this division is recovering as well, the LTM sales are almost $24b and the operating margin is at 22%. This amazing recovery in such a short period of time indicates the strong brand around the company.

**Historical financial performance**

If we look at the annual report, the combined financials are not equal to the sum of the two divisions. When looking into the individual divisions, what's not taken into account are the restructuring expenses that Disney had (over $5b in 2020 due to the pandemic) that are not allocated to any division to provide a better view and not distort the division's profitability. The same goes for the goodwill impairment and certain expenses that are related to the 21st Century Fox and Hulu acquisitions. 

The balance sheet doubled in size in the last 5 years (roughly from $100b to $200b) majority of that due to the acquisitions ($50b goodwill, $10b other intangible assets) and their investments in content assets (&gt;$20b)

On the other side of the balance sheet, it is quite clear how this was financed as there's a significant increase in debt of over $30b and there's a significant increase in the number of shares outstanding (from 1.5b to 1.8b).

&amp;#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value. The assumptions are listed below:

**Revenue growth:** 15% for the next 12 months, followed by 6% in the 4 years after that and declining over time to 2.91%. The analysts are forecasting roughly 23% for 2022 and 12% for 2023. However, as the last public data is up until Q1/2022 (which is half of the financial year 2022 for Disney), part of this growth is already in the financials and included in my starting point.

**Operating margin**: Looking into the various divisions, a long-term target of 25% seems reasonable. Of course, this is highly dependent on the recovery of the DPEP division (which is on track) and the profitability of their Direct-to-consumer segment. In my model, I'm expecting the margin to increase slowly over time, reaching 25% in 8 years.

**Discount rate**: Currently 8.37% (based on WACC) increasing to 9.64% over time (also due to the fact that the FED is raising the interest rate)

**Outcome**: $89.4 (Current share price $96.08)

\*Note: In the DCF calculation, the outstanding equity options and the minority interest are also taken into account.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions stated above, the revenue will grow by 78% to $138.1b in the next 10 years and the operating margin will reach 25%.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) changes based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Op. margin|23%|25%|27%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|70% ($132.0b)|$78.4|$87.0|$95.5|
|78% ($138.1b)|$80.5|$89.4|$98.3|
|110% ($163.1b)|$94.6|$105.0|$115.4|
|140% ($186.4b)|$106.7|$118.4|$130.2|

It is worth mentioning that historically, Disney has almost always traded at a premium over the intrinsic value as it is seen as a bit more safe investment due to the brand behind it.

I am trying to figure out some options for affording a new roof and car. The main concern is the roof at the moment though.

Our car was a 04 Toyota Camry that has catastrophic engine failure. I was informed the price would be $7000+ to fix, but that wasn't the only thing wrong with it, so buying another car seems to be the option. We are borrowing a car for now until we find a new car.

As for our roof, it's 30 years old so insurance isn't going to buy a weather claim to replace it. We have multiple large water leaks. It's been patched a time or two. We've been quoted about $7500 for roof replacement. That's assuming the wood isn't rotten - with the visible water damage from our ceiling I believe we'll need some more replacements.

Wells Fargo is who the mortgage is through, but they no longer do Home Equity Lines of Credit. This was going to be the way we were going to pay but without that line our heads are spinning at all the options available out there. We don't want to re-finance to a higher interest rate to cover the roof unless it's somehow less expensive in the long run. (Current interest rate under ~3, current rates if we re-financed would be 5+)

He has Wells Fargo and South State Bank.
I personally have Ally, South State, First Citizen, and multiple barely used credit cards through amex, Citi, discover and capital one. I'd prefer to use his credit lines since the issues were caused by negligence before I came into the picture. Both our credit scores are 750+

But as of July 1, I started a $100k job, and the IRS withholding calculator says I need to increase my withholding or else I'll owe a large amount next year. Why is that? Why wouldn't it just continue to be withheld at the proper rate? 

I have a guess, but I'm not sure if it's right - that my new company thinks I'm going to be earning $100k for only 6 months, so $50k total for 2022. As such, they're doing $50k - $12,950 * federal tax rate. Which basically means they're withholding at too low of a bracket, not knowing that I've already earned half a year of salary.

I recently started taking my finances seriously and started saving for an emergency fund and have about $2250 put away so far.  Ultimately I want to save $15,000 for the emergency fund. 

I’m tempted to start rolling over the fund into I-bonds each time we time we save $2500. But I’m also seeing reports about recession and market crashes.  We’re saving $250 a month, so we should have a new $2500 every 10 months, so it’s not like we’d be out of some emergency money for too long. 

I think one way to help me decide is how much I’d gain by putting the money in I-bonds. Is the interest added to each month for 6 months or do you just get the interest rate for the whole amount once during that six month period?

For example if I have $100 in a 5% I-bond, do I get $5 interest payment for the first 6 months or do I get $30 ($5 for each of the 6 months)?

stocks,UPST issues preliminary earnings,"From the press release. Looks bad for UPST holders. 

-Upstart Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UPST), a leading artificial intelligence (AI) lending marketplace, today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the second quarter ending June 30, 2022. Upstart also announced that its final second quarter fiscal year 2022 business and financial results will be released on Monday, August 8, 2022 after the market close.

Second Quarter 2022 Preliminary Unaudited Financial Results:

Revenue is expected to be approximately $228 million, previously guided at $295 to $305 million
Contribution margin is expected to be approximately 47%, previously guided at approximately 45%
Net Income (loss) is expected to be in the range of ($31)-($27) million, previously guided at ($4) to $0 million
“Inflation and recession fears have driven interest rates up and put banks and capital markets on cautious footing,” said Dave Girouard, co-founder and CEO of Upstart. “Our revenue was negatively impacted by two factors approximately equally. First, our marketplace is funding constrained, largely driven by concerns about the macroeconomy among lenders and capital market participants. Second, in Q2, we took action to convert loans on our balance sheet into cash, which, given the quickly increasing rate environment, negatively impacted our revenue.”

stocks,Ganfeng Lithium - short analysis,"Lady and Gents of this marvelous sub reddit.
Most of us know the risk of investing our hard earn money in enterprises of our East Asian nemesis, China. But today I'd like to show you the following company, which personally I think has some potential.

**Ganfeng Lithium**

Why do I like the stock? It because of the following:

* High current asset ( 887 million USD)
* Moderate debt amount (882 million USD)
* Rising earning (rising spot price of lithium)
* Steady P/CF ratio (2,14%)

**Opinion:**
It's nice to see that they have plenty of assets to cover all of their liabilities. It's shows that the company is really health and has the capability to use some leverage in the future. The rising spotprice of lithium that is driven by the electrification of automobile is thriving the demand of lithium. Furthermore, the market their is  capital intensive, meaning that they can expect to many new competitors. Especially in times where interest rates are high.
What I don't like about the company it the price to cashflow ratio is pretty low. Normally I would accept a ratio higher than 10%. But with rising spot prices on the lithium market this could change really quick. There has been a growth over 200% between Q1 2022 and Q1 2021. Furthermore we shouldn't forget that this is a Chinese company, meaning there will be issues with the US.

**Overall opinion**: If you like to speculate on higher commodity prices, then Ganfeng might just be a great company.

so I am not sure if entering into a car loan of 36 or 48 or 60 months is ok rather than getting a balance transfer of the amount, make a monthly payment of 400$ (currently paying 350$ for lease) till 0 APR and 
pay off whatever is remaining from the saving after JAN 2024 (this way the title remains with me and I can sell the car the day I want in case my work permit is not approved.

solar,"New home, solar options?","Hey all! Coming from r/solardiy and figured I'd try my luck here also. In the next few weeks, my father and I (both contractors, and licensed electricians) will be beginning to build a new home for myself.  The home is in an area with no natural gas, so I've decided to go  electric for everything, no propane or oil. Because I'll be going  electric everything, I've really started to look into pricing and  options for solar.

It's difficult  to estimate exactly the electricity consumption for a new home, but  right now some calculators are estimating as little as 670 kWh/month,  and others as high as 1,500 kWh/month. It's a 1700sq foot home as  insulated and energy efficient as possible, mini splits, heat pump water  heaters etc.

I've had some roof  solar quotes, coming in around $2.75-$3.50/Watt. While none of that  seems too bad, we've also looked at the pros and cons of doing a ground  based solar system ourselves. From what I've been seeing kits in the  15kW range are around $30,000-$35,000, not including wire, footings etc.  They say they produce roughly 1,500 kWh/month for our location in NJ.  That comes out to about $300/month in production based on our average  $.20/kWh price that we've been paying recently. The additional cost on  our mortgage for installing that system would be about $150/month after  the federal tax credit.

My  question is this.. is there something I'm missing? It seems to be too  good when solar would be saving $300 per month at the cost of $150 per  month. Is it because we're able avoid labor charges by installing it  ourselves?",energy,1657247490

Honestly, this is intimidating to me. I could really use some insight. The loan pause for COVID will also end soon, and I want to take advantage of this time.

If you were me, which loans would you pay off first? (I included the interest rates in the totals):

My Loans:

1.) $6,740.12 at 6.8% Unsubsidized

2.) $2,959.13 at 3.86% Unsubsidized

3.) $9,805.82 at 6.6% Unsubsidized 

4.) $2,523.72 at 6.08% Unsubsidized

6.) $5,000 at 4.3% Unsubsidized 

Total = $27,028.79

My Husbands Loans:

7.) Consolidated his loans to $44,000 at 6.5%

I could also pause my retirement contributions and put them towards loans.

From the article: 

""U.S. officials who are personally invested in cryptocurrencies are now disqualified from working on crypto-related policy and regulation that could affect the value of their assets.

A [legal advisory notice](https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/News+Releases/E116F1FD24F94BB3852588770058A0FA/$FILE/LA-22-04.pdf) issued by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Tuesday declared that the de minimis exemption – which, when applied to a security, would allow the owner of an amount below a certain threshold to work on policy related to that security – doesn’t apply to any cryptocurrency or stablecoin, even if the cryptocurrencies in question “constitute securities for purposes of the federal or state securities laws.”

The directive applies to all White House staff and the employees of all federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department.

The directive will likely have a significant impact on some White House staffers who have been open about their crypto investments, like Tim Wu, a technology adviser to the Biden administration who [holds millions of dollars](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/08/top-white-house-adviser-tim-wu-holds-millions-in-bitcoin-report/) in bitcoin. Wu has already voluntarily recused himself from working on crypto policy.

Federal employees who have invested less than $50,000 in a mutual fund with exposure to the crypto sector will still be allowed to work on crypto-related policies.""

Forex,How will the NFP report impact FX markets?,"A hawkish Federal Reserve relative to other central banks has helped fuel a strong rally for the US Dollar this year. Safe-haven flows on intensifying recession concerns also caused a number of currencies to hit new lows against USD this week, with the Euro being of added interest as it threatens to reach parity against the greenback for the first time since 2002.

EUR/USD has traded in a bearish channel since February, and losses accelerated in recent days as the EU’s economic outlook has looked increasingly bleak. However, with the pair now trading in oversold territory, a weak NFP print on Friday could help reclaim some of the recent losses as it would signal the condition of the US economy may not be that much greater than the Eurozone. 

It could also help other major currencies push higher against the Dollar in the near-term, not just on growth concerns, but increased speculation that the Fed has reached peak hawkishness and may take a step back.

Of course, all trading carries risk, and stronger-than-expected jobs data would likely boost USD even further. Either way, it will be worth watching what the final result is and how markets react.",finance,1657260735
stocks,One of Wall Street’s biggest bulls lowers S&amp;P 500 target — still sees 25% upside by year-end,"Oppenheimer strategists have lowered their year-end price target for the S&amp;P 500 in light of the stickier inflation and geopolitical tensions over the first half of 2022.  Oppenheimer &amp; Co.’s John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist and one of the most bullish prognosticators on Wall Street, now expects the S&amp;P 500 SPX, +1.50% to finish the year at 4,800, after staying stridently optimistic in his previous forecast of 5,330. That indicates 24.8% upside in the index by year-end based on its closing level of 3,845 on Wednesday. 

“The incursion into Ukraine by Russia and China’s lockdown of Shanghai (a city of over 25 million people) as well as of other cities in China added catalysts over the course of the first half of this year which have, along with higher and stickier inflation, added enough uncertainty and soured sentiment to negatively challenge equity market performance to a greater extent than we had earlier expected,” wrote strategists led by Stoltzfus in a client note on Wednesday. 

Stoltzfus said in an interview with Bloomberg last month that he had stuck with his 5,330 target — a 40% rally from where the S&amp;P 500 stood on June 21. The benchmark index SPX, +1.50% last week closed out its worst half-year performance since 1970 as market participants expect the Federal Reserve to continue aggressively tightening monetary policy to get a grip on the inflation, but worry the interest rates will rise to levels that cause a recession. However, Stoltzfus remains bullish.

personalfinance,"Invested in managed growth fund account, Don't want to actively invest am i doing this correct?","Hi all, Im very very new to investing,

So... I just opened a Halifax ISA investment account. It's a managed growth fund, 6 (high risk). I deposited about £5,000. (See, I figured, I won't need this money right now and there's no point leaving it in a savings account against interest rate and inflation) So I just figured, High risk, managed growth. (I'm not beating the market or anything) it was just a one off lump payment.

If I lost the money, It would hurt, but it wouldn't put me in debt (only be a few months of work gone)  
Is that all there is to it? Because I was planning on leaving it for 5-10 years (everyone says, ride the bumps. It's not about trading every chance you get to 'beat the market') Or am I making some rookie mistake and should switch elsewhere (I initially tried to back out but on the phone, the trade already went. so I would have to wait for 'settlement' July 12th and only then can I sell my shares) It's in SCOT WIDOWS UT MGR .

I'm not sure if I want to fiddle around choosing stocks. I just want to put my money in a fund, then leave it for years to come... Is there a better way or is what I'm doing 'okay'?

End goal is just to grow my money. Willing to wait like 5-10 years before touching it.",finance,1657275032

personalfinance,Buying a car in cash,"Hi everyone, 

I am about to get a 300-400% salary increase and I need a car. I have an accord with 150,000 miles and I look forward to buying a car when the accord hits 180-190k (both because it’s needed and as a a treat). I still haven’t figured what I car I want but I have made it a rule to buy certified pre-owned car. I plan on maintaining as much of my current lifestyle as I can. 

My question is: since interest rates are higher in certified pre-owner cars, would there be a benefit to saving up the money and buying the car with cash? If not, why not? 
Also how would I present that to the car dealer? Do I pretend to plan to refinance and then say I will pay cash instead? Is that stupid? The idea of buying a car is very intimidating, tbh. Thank you in advance.",finance,1657280701
personalfinance,Would a taxable account or my mortgage be my next priority?,"Hello all

I've been a long time lurker and know the Prime Derective by heart, but I find myself needing some advice. 

Would it be worth investing into a taxable account in my situation, or perhaps put money towards my mortgage (the payment of which has increase fairly steeply in the past two years due to property taxes and HOA gouging our dues). 

-Stats-

Age:
31

Income:
$70-90k (I suppose $80k is a good middle ground). 

Debt:
$198,000 on mortgage @3.75% (home is worth $265k but could see it dropping if a correction occurs). Payment is $1,450.

Emergency Fund:
$60k (1 years expenses plus potential downpayment in case my old car quits)

Traditional IRA:
$195,000 (rolled over from previous employer)

Current 401k:
$75,000

Roth IRA:
$55,000

HSA:
$7,500 (only had it for two years)

Brokerage: 
$50,000 (invested in VTI and VOO so dropping lol)

I max out my Roth, HSA, and put 20% in my 401k (employer doesn't allow anymore unfortunately) every year. So that essentially leaves me with the option of continuing to add to my brokerage or pay down my home (a mortgage recast maybe?). A finance guy I spoke to a while back mentioned that I have ""too much"" in my tax deferred accounts and my tax situation will be FUBAR when I retire (due to the large tax bill I'll have from my 401k). 

While I understand i have a pretty good interest rate, im a pretty debt adverse guy, and my income has been cut due to the ""recession"" and my home payment continues to climb. Furthermore, i fear that, if the housing market does correct, i could risk my home being underwater, so maybe a mortgage recast would improve my cash flow. What do you guys think?

Thanks for any and all input, you guys are great.",finance,1657281946

#[S&amp;P 500 futures are flat ahead of key jobs report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/07/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed on Friday following a rally on Wall Street as investors await a key jobs report Friday.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat, while S&amp;P 500 futures dipped about 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures slipped nearly 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The action in futures followed a winning session Thursday in which the S&amp;P 500 posted a four-day positive streak, matching its longest of the year thus far. The index is now down about 19% from its all-time high in January.
*****
&gt; The June employment report due on Friday is expected to show another month of strong hiring as the labor market bucks any signs of an impending recession or economic slowdown. Economists expect that the U.S. economy added 250,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate will remain flat at 3.6%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; In May, employers added 390,000 jobs, which was better than economists expected.
*****
&gt; “With the set up of a tough Fed on the basis of wanting to aggressively tame inflation with the comfort of a strong labor market ... today’s number is especially relevant,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group, said in a note Friday morning. “If the unemployment rate starts to rise from here, I expect the Fed’s tough talk to be tempered in the months to come.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up about 2% during this holiday-shortened week, and it’s on pace for its second positive week in the last three.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are up 0.92% and 4.4% this week, respectively. Both indexes are also on track for their second positive week in the last three.
*****
&gt; Shares of Levi Strauss gained more than 3% in the premarket after the retailer reported quarterly earnings that exceeded expectations and boosted its dividend.
*****
&gt; GameStop fell about 6% in premarket trading as the company fired its chief financial officer and said it would lay off employees as part of a turnaround plan. The stock notched a 15% gain in the prior session after the video game retailer announced a 4-for-1 stock split.
*****
&gt; Energy stocks led gains during Thursday’s trading, as the price of oil reversed from a recent dip. Exxon Mobil climbed nearly 3.2%, while Occidental Petroleum added close to 4%. Chipmakers boosted the tech sector after strong earnings from Samsung.
*****
&gt; “You just don’t see the capitulation just yet, I think there’s a little bit more that needs to happen between now and the July Fed meeting,” Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Thursday. He added that stocks could pull back as early as Friday’s session.

personalfinance,Electric Cars &amp; $7500 tax credit,"Hi everyone,

I've been googling about the tax credits and I can't find anything concrete about how they work. 

I find the amounts, and that they give a federal tax credit....but...my question is - do you just not pay federal income tax till your credit is acheived? Or do you file on your taxes and you just get a lump sum rebate? 

Any help would be appreciated. I think I'm at the point where I'm ready to say screw oil companies and jump ship. My car is worth quite a bit on trade despite having 100k on it. It's paid off and I have 5k to drop down. On one of these cars I'm looking at around $300/mo in the 45k price range for a purchase. I never buy new cars but I'm just sick of corporate greed and gas. Thanks!",finance,1657284617
stocks,"U. S. employers add a solid 372,000 jobs in sign of resilience","America’s employers shrugged off high inflation and weakening growth to add 372,000 jobs in June, a surprisingly strong gain that will likely spur the Federal Reserve to keep sharply raising interest rates to cool the economy and slow price increases.

The past year’s streak of robust hiring has been good for job seekers and has led to higher pay for many employees. But it has also helped fuel the highest inflation in four decades and heightened pressure on the Fed to further slow borrowing and spending.

The unemployment rate in June remained at 3.6% for a fourth straight month, the Labor Department said Friday, matching a near-50-year low that was reached before the pandemic struck in early 2020.

Many employers are still struggling to fill jobs, especially in the economy’s vast service sector, with Americans now traveling, eating out and attending public events with much greater frequency. The Fed may see the June job gain as evidence that the rapid pace of hiring is feeding inflation as companies raise pay to attract workers and then increase prices to cover their higher labor costs.

The Fed has already embarked on its fastest series of rate hikes since the 1980s, and further large increases would making borrowing much costlier for consumers and businesses and increase the risk of a recession.

solar,"First Solar Estimate/Quote, What Am I Missing?","Background: Estimate was provided by Crown Exteriors &amp; Construction; I am located in central IL; Titan Solar is the manufacturer; Inverter is SolarEdge; System Size 7.6 kW; Solar Panels 19; Estimated 7,968 kWh Annually; Estimated solar offset of 115%; Cost $39k financed at 1.99% over 25 years.

Excluding the federal and IL credits for solar, I am estimating a monthly payment of $149...which I believe on average is more than I typically pay for electric on a monthly basis.

stocks,The size of an already shrunken labor force shrinks again,"The rosy U.S. jobs report in June wasn’t all good. There were a few potential thorns that suggest trouble lies ahead.

**First the good news.** The U.S. added 372,000 new jobs last month, well above the 250,000 Wall Street forecast. The unemployment rate also stayed near a half-century low of 3.6%. The robust employment report countered recent talk that the U.S. could enter a recession soon. The Federal Reserve is sharply raising interest rates to cool off a scorching labor market and tame high inflation, but rising rates tend to slow the economy to a crawl. The central bank’s strategy might already be starting to work, however. How so? The increase in new jobs last month was derived from a survey of businesses. Yet a separate survey of households found fewer people working.

Not only that, but the household survey showed employment falling in two of the past three months. The last time that happened? In the first two months of the pandemic, when the U.S. lost a stunning 21 million jobs. “The separate household survey laid an egg in June,” said Sophia Koropeckyj, managing director at Moody’s Analytics.

**Another bad sign in the household survey:** the share of people 16 or older who have a job or are looking for one hit a wall. The so-called labor-force participation rate slipped again to 62.2% from a pandemic high of 62.4 in the early spring. The participation rate hangs 1.2 points below its pre-pandemic level, the equivalent of about 1.5 million missing workers. “The high number of people not returning to the work force is one of the nagging problems with the labor market right now,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. Now these potential thorns could turn out to be something differently entirely. For one thing, the household survey is less accurate than the government’s poll of business establishments. It’s more volatile and subject to frequent and large revisions. The apparent stall in household employment, what’s more, might simply reflect a shortage of workers instead of a rapidly declining number of available jobs and companies willing to hire.

Job opening are still extremely high at 11 million-plus, after all, and wages rose again in June. Hourly pay has risen at a sharp 5.1% pace over the past year. If the labor market had suddenly gotten weak-kneed, wage growth would probably slow more quickly. The decline in the labor force in June “is hard to explain,” said chief economist Aneta Markowska of Jefferies LLC, in light of the strong demand for labor.

stocks,Is everything OK at Upstart?,"There have already been a few posts around the preliminary results, but no one has discussed the CEO's and CFO's comments, which I think are the most interesting part.  If you're here, you probably already know they posted a \~25% revenue miss for Q2 and -12% margins.

[https://ir.upstart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/upstart-announces-preliminary-unaudited-q222-financial-results](https://ir.upstart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/upstart-announces-preliminary-unaudited-q222-financial-results)

&gt;“Inflation and recession fears have driven interest rates up and put banks and capital markets on cautious footing,” said Dave Girouard, co-founder and CEO of Upstart. “Our revenue was negatively impacted by two factors approximately equally. First, our marketplace is funding constrained, largely driven by concerns about the macroeconomy among lenders and capital market participants. Second, in Q2, we took action to convert loans on our balance sheet into cash, which, given the quickly increasing rate environment, negatively impacted our revenue.”

I find this really unusual.  First off, the CEO says their big problem is funding loans they originate.  Next, he says they were liquidating their own inventory of loans... presumably into that same funding constrained pool of lenders.  He's basically saying ""there weren't enough lenders for all the loans we wanted to originate, and, instead of plugging that hole with our excess liquidity, we threw fuel on the fire and trimmed our portfolio of held loans.""

Are they speculating on that interest rates will go higher than the fixed income market is currently predicting?  Do they not believe in their own models and are looking to dump these held loans?  Exclusive of their loan purchases, Upstart has generated reasonable amounts of cash from their operations.  They have an open repurchase program, but it's only about half of their cash position as of Q1.  They should have plenty of room to keep growing their notes receivable.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sanjay Datta, CFO of Upstart, said ""Despite the tumultuous economy, Upstart-powered loans have performed exceptionally well. For loans facilitated through our platform and held by our more than 60 bank and credit union partners, average returns have consistently met or exceeded expectations since the program’s inception in 2018.""  
&gt;  
&gt;“For loans purchased by non-bank institutions, all vintages from 2018 thorough 2020 delivered significant excess returns, while our 2021 vintage is within 100 basis points of our loss expectations. Lastly, we believe our models are well calibrated to economic conditions and are currently targeting returns in excess of 10 percent.”

Again, that sounds great.  10% returns on originated loans in the current macro environment would be excellent.  They have $650M in debt at .25% interest, and $500M in net current assets.  If there isn't enough liquidity from their network of lenders, why aren't they buying these loans themselves?   Why are they selling off assets they project will generate 10%+ RoR in favor of cash, at the detriment of their ongoing loan originations?

For many years I've been using a credit card that is through my bank. It's easy and simple and helps build credit (I guess). But it has no rewards or perks at all. So I want to get a rewards card and was looking at the Capitol One SavorOne rewards for Students card, as I am currently a graduate student.

I figure having a card with cash back for dining and groceries (realistically the only thing I ever spend money on pretty much) would be pretty wise. I intend to pay it off as I use it, so I'm not real worried about interest rates, as I'll basically just use it as if it were a debit card.

Should I not apply for the card? My understanding is pretty limited, but I have a good credit score, 750+. The only reason I can think of being denied would be my pretty awfully small income.

# **Another hot inflation report and the start of earnings season make for a challenging week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/08/another-hot-inflation-report-q2-earnings-make-for-difficult-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation data and the start of the second quarter earnings season could be two catalysts that make for a bumpy ride in markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; PepsiCo’s earnings are the first major report of the week Tuesday, and Delta Air Lines reports Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley kick off bank earnings season Thursday, and Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial, among others, follow on Friday.
*****
&gt; A cluster of inflation reports could affect markets, since they help set the tone for how aggressive the Federal Reserve will have to be in its battle to calm inflation.
*****
&gt; The June consumer price index looms large on Wednesday, and economists expect it could be hotter than May’s 8.6% year-over-year pace. It is also the report that could move markets most.
*****
&gt; “The headline is expected to be higher. That’s mostly because of energy,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. He added that core inflation, excluding food and energy, could be lower. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were as high as $122 per barrel in June, but have since fallen back in July and was just under $105 per barrel Friday.
*****
&gt; “The question is to what extent the moderation in goods prices is going to be offset by continued increasing services prices, predominantly driven by rent,” Boockvar said. “The government stats still have a lot of catch up room to the upside on rent.”
*****
&gt; There is also the June producer price index Thursday, and investors are closely watching Friday’s University of Michigan consumer sentiment report for July. That report contains consumer expectations about future inflation, an important metric watched by the Federal Reserve. June retail sales, another measure of the consumer, is also released Friday.
*****
&gt; “PPI is the seed for CPI...and it could have another 10% handle,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; The new inflation data comes on the heels of Friday’s strong employment report. In June, the economy added 372,000 jobs, about 120,000 more than expected. Strategists say the report reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates by another 75 basis points later this month. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.
*****
&gt; “It was enough to continue on the path they’ve chosen. It’s not until you start to see rising unemployment on a monthly basis that I believe the Fed will start to buckle its knees,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; A key question for markets is when will inflation peak, as it has already continued to flare higher much longer than the Fed had initially anticipated.
*****
&gt; “I do think a risk to the markets is this fact that inflation may not have peaked,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I do still believe the markets are at least hopeful, if not expecting, that inflation will decelerate.”
*****
&gt; As investors watch the pace of inflation, the second quarter earnings season begins. Corporate profits could be the source of some market turbulence, if analysts are force to chop estimates for the balance of the year, as many expect.
*****
&gt; “The street has not really changed the estimates. Revenue growth has ticked down. Margins are compressing. Analysts are leaving their estimates unchanged,” said Boockvar. “If there’s going to be a readjustment, this is the time.”
*****
&gt; Second quarter earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to grow by 5.7%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. The third- and fourth quarter estimates have been moving down slightly, but are still 10.9% and 10.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is bracing for a challenging earnings quarter, so how much it will result in volatility is unclear,” said Arone.

&gt; # Get Ready for the Quadrennial Rally

&gt; Unfortunately, the stock market is delivering on its bearish historical 4-Year Cycle and seasonal tendencies here at the midway point of 2022. It is also playing out the less than sanguine outlook we wrote last year around this time in the 2022 Stock Trader’s Almanac (pages 10-11) and in our annual forecast from last December 16. So where do we go from here?

&gt; Much to our chagrin the short answer is that we have likely not seen the low either in price or time. Current trends are now leaning towards the “Worst Case” scenario we presented in our 2022 forecast which was for a “Mild bear market for S&amp;P 500 with 2022 ending down 10-20%.” With S&amp;P 500 down 20.6% year-to-date at the end of June the bear is fully in place.

&gt; As we have been guiding over the past several months, we still expect this bear to put in a typical midterm election year bottom sometime in the August-October timeframe just ahead of the midterm elections. Stocks are clearly exhibiting the historical weakness that often transpires in the Worst Six Months of the year May-October and they are also tracking the “Weak Spot” of the 4-year cycle. But this should set us up for the “Sweet Spot” of the cycle from Q4 midterm year through Q2 pre-election year.

&gt; The intersection of the annual seasonal pattern and the 4-Year Cycle produces the quadrennial “Sweet Spot.” As we continue to patiently ride out this bear the chart below of the 4-year cycle may provide some solace. We are currently finalizing the 2023 edition of the Stock Trader’s Almanac so here’s a sneak peek at this new chart from the 2023 STA that highlights the midterm low and most importantly the quadrennial rally from the midterm low to the pre-election year high in what we call the Sweet Spot of the 4-year cycle.

&gt; The second and third quarter of the midterm year has been the weakest period of the entire 4-year pattern averaging losses over the 2-quarter period of -1.2% for the Dow, -1.5% for the S&amp;P 500 and -5.0% for the NASDAQ Composite Index. But in the Sweet Spot of the cycle the Dow gains 19.3%, S&amp;P 500 increases 20.0% and NASDAQ jumps 29.3% over the three-quarter span from midterm year Q4 to pre-election year Q2.

&gt; It is for this reason that we call midterm election years “A Bottom Pickers Paradise.” From the midterm low to the pre-election year high DJIA gains 46.8% since 1914 and NASDAQ gains a whopping 68.2% since 1974! As the 2022 bear market runs its course, the market will likely bounce along sideways, testing the lows, hitting its low point in late Q3 or early Q4 in the August-October period in prototypical midterm bottom fashion. Then be prepared for the rally off that low into the Sweet Spot and beyond to new highs.

&gt; # Bulls Back Below 20%

&gt; Even though the second half of June and first week of July have seen the S&amp;P 500 climb back from its lows, sentiment appears to show that investors are not buying it. In today's update of AAII sentiment survey, there was an overall push toward more bearish tones. For starters, the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell back below 20%. Even though that is not any sort of new low, this week is the fifth in a row with less than a quarter of respondents reporting as bullish. As shown in the second chart below, such a streak has been unprecedented with the last example of such an extended streak of depressed sentiment being May of 1993.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-1.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-1a.png))**

&gt; As bulls have been no where to be found, bears are plentiful with over half of respondents reporting bearish sentiment. This week's reading came in at 52.8%, up from 46.7% last week. Mirroring bullish sentiment, that is not any sort of new pinnacle for bearish sentiment as there were even higher readings that closed in on 60% last month. Regardless, sentiment remains historically pessimistic with few other periods having seen such elevated readings for as extended of periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; With inverse moves in bulls and bears, there is now a 33.4 percentage point gap between the two readings which is in the 2nd percentile of all readings since the survey began in 1987.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; That leaves neutral sentiment to be the only normal reading of the survey. At 27.8%, neutral sentiment is in the middle of its pandemic range and only 3.6 percentage points below its historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; The more bearish turn at the expense of bulls witnessed in this week's AAII survey was echoed by other readings on sentiment like the Investors Intelligence survey and NAAIM Exposure index. Combining all three of these sentiment readings into one composite, overall outlooks for the market took a further bearish turn this week with the average survey currently 1.8 standard deviations below its historical norm. That is slightly better than earlier this spring, but still, the only period since the mid-2000s with similarly pessimistic readings was in late 2008 and into 2009.

&gt; # Worst First Half Since 1970 Spin

&gt; As the market logged its worst first half start to the year since 1970 with DJIA down 15.3%, S&amp;P off 20.6% and NASDAQ down 29.5%, there has been a lot of positive spin on how great second halves are when the market is down so much in the first half. Well, we did some deeper digging and went back a bit further than some of the cherry-picked stats we have seen.

&gt; Unfortunately, as you can see in this chart of DJIA Top 10 Worst First Half Starts since 1901 all but two of the years, 1939 and 1970 end down 10% or more. Five years (1932, 1939, 1940, 1962 &amp; 1970) ended significantly higher (&gt;5%) than their mid-year levels. Three (1907, 1920, &amp; 2008) ended much lower and two (1910 &amp; 1913) were flat from mid-year to yearend.

&gt; # Worst Week of the Year For Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims remain historically healthy in the low 200K range, but the most recent week's data did mark one of the highest readings of the year. Coming off of last week's unrevised 231K, claims rose 4K to the highest level since the second week of the year when they clocked in at 240K. That remains a much better reading than what was observed throughout much of the history of the data, but it is at the higher end of pre-pandemic readings (those from roughly 2017 through 2019).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; As for the non-seasonally adjusted number, the current week of the year is essentially guaranteed to see a week-over-week increase. The current week has historically been the worst of the year in terms of week-over-week moves only having seen unadjusted claims fall once since 1967. That one decline was in 2020 when claims were working off unprecedented record highs. Given that historically consistent drift higher in claims during this point of the year, next week has historically averaged a temporary peak in claims. While that lends to the possibility of claims continuing to rise next week, the current reading is below that of comparable weeks of pre-pandemic years. In other words, claims are following standard seasonal patterns and are doing so at historically strong levels even if they have come off the absolute strongest levels of the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/070722-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims have also begun to come off of the best levels of the pandemic. Adjusted continuing claims were expected to go unchanged at 1.328 million this week. Instead, they rose up to 1.375 million; the highest level since the week of April 22nd when claims were 12K higher.

personalfinance,"Quitting my job, and have some questions about my W4 and 403b","Hi all, a bit of a long post as I’m looking for some specific and some general financial insights. I’m using an anonymous account because I’m very active on my main account and also have friends on there, so I don’t want all this stuff linked to me. 

About me: single, mid 30s female working in clinical healthcare in a very subspecialized field, living in a VHCOL city. I was in school and training forever and have only had a “real job” for about 3.5 years. However, I’m quitting my job this summer because I’m extremely burnt out. Working through Covid really did a number on me, and the last year has been a lot of therapy to heal what I think has been PTSD from working through the pandemic. However, during this time, my workplace has also become pretty toxic. I finally decided to make the move and just quit. 

I have some money saved up, and I’m planning to take a real break for the next 3 to 6 months as I mentally and physically take care of my health and reset so I can perform my best when I’m back at work. I am mostly planning on traveling, volunteering, and spending time with family. 

I have a few financial questions and I’ll preface this by saying, I have absolutely no financial background. In fact, being in healthcare, I’m probably even more clueless than the lay person. I’m not ashamed to admit it. But I’m willing to learn more, so please be patient with me. 


1. W4 question #1: This past tax year, I got hit with a hefty fine because not enough federal taxes were withheld from my paycheck. I ended up owing a huge amount in federal taxes as well as a fine. However, I have been at the same job for the last 3.5 years, and I’ve had no change in my W-4 withholdings. My W-4 is pretty simple - I don’t have dependents or complicated taxes. My salary has stayed essentially the same. Any idea how I can figure out what the issue is? I don’t want this to happen for next year.

2. W4 question number #2: I will be unemployed and have no income starting end of August. Do I need to make any changes to my W-4?

3. I have a 403b retirement account that I have been trying to put money in and maximize for the last few years, with some matching from my employer. It was doing pretty ok until recently. I have about 100k in it. What do I do with my 403b account once I leave my place of employment? Dumb question, but does the money stay there? I read somewhere online that I should try to transfer it to a Roth IRA? If that is true, how does that work, and why would I do that?


4. Is it worth getting a financial advisor? I know this varies from person to person. I had one for about a year a couple of years ago, who charged me 100$/month for not doing a lot of work. I got rid of them. However, I am now at a point in my career where I want to work no more than part-time, and I want to focus more on things in my life that I haven’t been able to do for years (volunteer, travel, etc). I want to become more financially savvy and make my money do more work for me without me working 80-100 hours a week. Is it worth getting a financial advisor for FIRE goals? Or is this something I can work on educating myself? 


Thank you for reading this far and for your patience. I am very excited to quit my job and take care of myself, but also a little bit anxious because I’m trying to understand my finances a little bit better. Thank you in advance for any advice you guys can offer!",finance,1657331229

* Inverters: Microinverters Hoymiles MI-350 (said they could upgrade to Enphase for ~$40 per inverter but they do Hoymiles on most residential installs unless they want battery backup)
* 25 year warranty on everything including labor
* Claimed offset 104% year 1 production 10,455 kWh

The system sizes vary because they all claimed different offsets percentages. Option 1 claims the highest year 1 production with the smallest size system, seems weird to me. I'm in Illinois so federal tax credit and Illinois SREC ABP program brings the cost of the systems down around ~$7k to $10k after incentives. Ends up about a 6-7 year payback which is what I was aiming for

Option 1 and 2 are both in town companies so those are what I'm leaning towards, and option 2 seems to really hate option 1 (guessing they lose business to them). I've read about the SunPower premium you pay, but if it's the same price as another system should the SunPower be the easy choice? Also microinverters vs string inverters, I don't really have a preference other than microinverters seems to be the way things are headed and have fewer failures?

personalfinance,Infinite Money Glitch: CD Interest Rates?,"I was browsing through some CD interest rates and came across:

https://www.investopedia.com/best-2-year-cd-rates-4801682

It seems that, for Quantic CDs:

\- the holding period return for the 2 year CD is 2.51%

\- the holding period return **for two years** for the 12 month CD is 4.06% (i.e. 1.0201\^2 - 1)

personalfinance,List of Low Interest Personal Loans 2022,"Hey [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance),

I'm in the process of looking for a personal loan for myself, and I thought I would do an update to my original post here: [List of Low Interest Personal Loans](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/anwnq3/list_of_low_interest_personal_loans/)

Again, I'm hoping we can create a consolidated list for low-interest personal loans. Ideally, I'm looking for personal loans without any Origination Fees or Prepayment Penalties.

personalfinance,"Can there be variable tax percentages withheld, paystub to paystub?","Hi!

I've been looking over my fiance's paystubs at her request, since she says she's terrible with numbers. (There's a whole other thing of wage theft that we are dealing with) and we were trying to calculate how much wage was stolen after taxes.

So I've been going through her paystubs one by one and comparing her gross salary to net pay.... but the percentage between the two is different week to week (by as much as 5%).

Money taken out of gross pay include: Federal tax withholdings, social security tax, medicare tax, and state income tax. Some weeks, the employer doesn't take *anything* out of the federal tax withholdings, and my fiance barely make the equivalent of $12,500 /yr, so it seems odd that tax brackets would kick in at this point. 

On the weeks that federal tax withholding *aren't* removed, shouldn't the tax amount be the same though, week to week? Isn't social security, medicare, and state income tax flat percentages, so that if i divide net pay by gross pay, the percentage should be roughly the same each time?

(For example, if you cash an I bond after 18 months, you get the first 15 months of interest.)*

Also\*, The initial interest rate on new Series I savings bonds is 9.62 percent. You can\* [*buy*](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ibuy.htm) *I bonds at that rate through October 2022.*

Does that mean that, if I put $100 into Series I bonds and cash them in 12 months, then how much would I have? I thought it would be 100\*(1 + (9.62 - 9.62/3) ) = 741.33. Why? Because we need to ""take out"" the 3 months from the APY rate of 9.62 (assuming this is APY), so we do this via 9.62 - 9.62/3.

investing,Is Commercial Real Estate a Systemic Risk?,"Hello,

I would like to discuss the risk of a deleveraging event in the commercial real estate sector.  It seems there are a combination of headwinds that are hitting this market all at once.  Could this be the equivalent of the 2008 housing crisis?  Is residential real estate the potential systemic risk that arises from Fed policy tightening and residual impacts of COVID?

Let's just examine some of the risks facing the commercial real estate industry:

* Commercial Real Estate tends to be in high-traffic areas, meaning it commands a higher price per square foot than residential or other types of real estate
* Commercial RE is comprised of several subsectors, including Office, Retail and Hospitality
   * These subsectors are somewhat interdependent.  That is, high-traffic areas depend on office workers to support restaurants and hotels nearby.  Retail as well, to a lesser extent.
* Commercial RE tends to be financed in shorter duration than residential.  Commercial RE loans tend to average around 5 years in length.  They will often be structured differently as well, one popular format being a ""balloon structure"", where the lender pays regular payments for the duration of the loan, then a large lump sum for the remainder at maturity.
* Interest rates have been increasing rapidly and steeply to combat inflation, greatly increasing the cost of financing, especially compared to the past 2 years post-COVID.
* The work-from-home movement has displaced workers from offices, and has resulted in companies moving out of higher cost areas in favor of lower cost areas (for ex. from SF to Atlanta)
* Work-from-home is more prominent and durable in white collar office jobs, which tend to be in the most desirable areas (downtown major cities)

**Retail**

* Increasing number of retail transactions done online
* Brick &amp; mortar retail is in a long term and likely permanent downtrend
* Even the consumer staples retailers like Walmart, Target just had their worst quarter possibly ever.  Imagine how the less established players are doing.
* Now imagine how they will do if we have a long term recession

Raising more capital via equity is now extremely unfavorable for these companies.  Their valuations have been decimated.  Many companies have lost 80%+ (TDOC, PTON, PYPL, DOCU, RBLX, ETC ETC).

Similar decimation in the venture capital markets.  There's just very little capital being deployed at the moment.  And that is likely to continue for the near future as the Fed continues interest rate hikes and the market continues its risk-off trend.  There is low potential upside in the near-term, because any significant recovery in equities would put pressure on the Fed to tighten further.

There was too much excess capital.  It needs to be washed out.  That doesn't happen overnight.  Not from these levels.  There is little reason for excitement in the near term.  The Fed has to ensure inflation stays low, and they will require more than a few lower CPI prints to feel satisfied.

So with all that said, all forms of assets are in a pretty violent repricing at the moment.  Real estate has been more stubborn to drop, but it is already coming under pressure.  US residential real estate has less impact.  There is a supply shortage of homes.  There are lots of potential buyers on the sidelines hoping for prices to drop.  Most homeowners refinanced during the Pandemic and locked in low interest rates for 20+ years.

So even if residential drops, it should be relatively uneventful.  The residential market can absorb a correction.  Commercial is a different story.  Real estate is highly-leveraged in general.  No one comes in and buys a property for cash.  Especially in a zero interest rate environment like we had just a year ago.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG)

There's an estimated $2.6 Trillion in commercial real estate loans outstanding.  Who is going to backstop those loans in a deleveraging event?  The banks?  You think the banks are gonna come in and take those properties?  The banks are in no position to absorb a commercial real estate collapse.

This isn't 2008.  There is no ""easy"" way out of this.  You can bail out these commercial RE loans, but it doesn't fix the underlying problem.  These properties as they exist today are decreasing in utility.  Many will need to be converted into residential / other.  There is simply way too much office space, and probably way too much retail as well.

In 2008, the housing crisis was just an issue of writing too many mortgages and packaging them as high quality products.  The houses itself weren't the problem.  People still needed houses then as much as they did before, and as much as they do today.  Technology has not displaced the need for a house.  In fact, due to work-from-home, it has increased the budget for the average consumer's house.

Commercial does not have that same intrinsic necessity.  Stores have found a ton of new real estate... online.  Offices have moved... online.  All the businesses that went into supporting the traffic involved in those types of properties are at risk.  

So get ready.  This could be the ""big one"" that defines this market cycle.  If commercial starts going down the toilet, it will be a systemic risk and it will extend all across the market.  IMO it is the first thing that ""breaks"" from the Fed continuing to hike rates.",finance,1657375603
personalfinance,1990s Paper Savings Bonds (EE series),"So when I was a teen/tween, my family members purchased me saving bonds for birthdays, Christmases etc, between the years 1990 and 1995. I have a total of seventeen paper bonds, five of which have reached final maturity, and I need to cash them out (will do that on Monday). My question is -- some of these matured bonds stopped accruing interest in 2020 and 2021.... from what I'm reading, I should have claimed the interest as income on my federal taxes the year that they came of age but that was not on my radar at the time. When I cash out the five bonds on Monday, will it be ok to claim all that interest (which exceeds $500) on my 2022 taxes when I file in the spring, or will I need to do amended tax returns for the past few years? And if I have to do amendments, is the government going to penalize/fine me for that? Thanks!",finance,1657379454
CryptoCurrency,Celsius called Ponzi scheme by ex-employee that has files a lawsuit,"The crazy thing here is that, allegedly, things began to go wrong when the cryptos soared too high too fast:

 

&gt;Celsius began to fall apart when the prices of digital assets, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, soared at the start of last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;At that point, Celsius' customers started withdrawing their holdings to sell high and bank a fat profit. Celsius, however, allegedly did not have enough funds to cover these transactions, and was forced to buy cryptocurrencies at a loss to return people's assets. In an attempt to attract new customers to inject more cryptocurrency to its platform, Celsius started offering double-digit interest rates.

Forex,GBP/USD next week analysis and prediction,"For me this is a strong BUY. Here is my reasoning:

\- The key resistance point is 1.2, this been tested and re-confirmed across the last 2 years (confirmed Fibonacci retracement). With closing on Friday at 1.206, the path of 'least resistance' is to rebound back to a bullish trend

\- RSI sits at 40, which tends to suggest a phase of support, but factoring in the above, this then becomes a weak bullish signal

\- The US will release employment figures come monday - the likelihood is these will be poor (continuing a downward trend), which would swing momentum back to pound

\- the greatest unknown is the impact of UK prime minister situation. if you benchmark the replacement timetable to Theresa May's exit, this will be weeks, not days. so would dampen the likelihood of a snap decision throwing markets into flux

\- Biden confidence continues to plummet, particularly over the sale of oil and the continuing Hunter saga

\- the most recent messages from the FED have been worrying, all but guaranteeing further restrictive measures to try and curb inflation.

personalfinance,Least purchase sale of home: questions,"(ETA: Sorry, **lease** purchase.)

My wife and I have a large, historic home on a 2.25% VA mortgage in the suburbs of Boston, where real estate prices are well above the national average. While local home prices did increase during the recent housing craze, they're not projected to fall as in such extremely run-up areas as AZ, FL, etc. Still, mortgage rate hikes have largely stalled sales of larger, more expensive homes in my town; there's still moderate action on more affordable places, generally sub-600k, but even those are taking longer to sell. 

(And our house is tougher to sell by virtue of being on the historic registry: it can't take some modern improvements like non-wood siding, outside changes may take approval from the historic commission, etc. It's a beautiful, large home  but with specialized appeal.)

Our extended family is relocating to NH where we've already bought our next home, to which we're moving now. Our options:

* Lower the asking price of our house for a short term sale. 
    * We'd likely give up 25% or more of our equity this way. 
    * However, the tax-free cash could immediately be deployed in the also-depressed stock market.
* Rent it out to cover PITI and maintenance, plus a little income, and wait for price recovery. 
    * As long as we sell in the next three years, gains will still be tax free (with the exception of depreciation recapture, taxed at a lower rate than our income tax bracket anyway).
    * Price recovery plus extra is not unlikely, though not by any means guaranteed.
        * The Fed will possibly drop rates in 2023 or even earlier.
        * Regardless, we may be looking at an ongoing recession. 
        * The pool of well-heeled cash buyers is somewhat depleted due to the recent frenzy, though not exhausted. 
        * Supply is still extremely depressed, though rising, and home builders have been hit by rising rates as well.
* Sell the home via a lease-purchase agreement.
    * We'd retain title and the lessee-purchaser (LP) would be responsible for all maintenance plus extra insurance, with us as insureds so we'd know of lapses in payment. 
    * LP would pay a large up-front down payment, then monthly payments in the amount of comparable rents in the area (roughly 160% of PITI). 
    * The period of the lease would be short, 18-24 months.
    * At the end we'd get a balloon payment (with increased equity due to the mortgage paydown during the lease term, as well as a higher sale price than on the open market).
    * **All the payments should still be tax-free.**
    * All payments would be forfeited (and presumably taxable, as in the nature of rent) in case of a breach by the LP. LP would of course have enough skin in the game to be incentivized to avoid a default.
        * There's the risk of needing to evict the LP in case of a breach. 

The lease purchase is what we're leaning toward, and we're having trouble assessing whether it will increase or decrease our risk. The LP could escape the agreement, perhaps, and we might be left with a house in a still-depressed market, but we could still fall back to renting it. Thoughts? Opinions?

Also, are the payments going to actually be tax-free if the lease purchase goes off without a hitch? Thanks!

**TL;DR** Selling primary residence via lease purchase too risky? Proceeds still tax free within three years?",finance,1657381594
personalfinance,Should I continue to contribute to my saving’s account now that I’ve garnered enough of an emergency fund to last me well over 6 months?,"Pretty much what the title says. My saving’s accounts’ interest rates is ridiculously low (as almost all saving’s accounts are). I have one with USAA and one with BMO Harris. Now, additional questions I have in this regards is would it be wiser to search around for a higher interest rate at other banks or should I just shoveling my money into my other investments (stocks, crypto, bonds, etfs, my 401K/Roth IRA)? I’m leaning towards doing the second with my only real concern being that my life will become more expensive as time goes on (parents supporting me less and less, school costs going up, I’m going to have to switch jobs soon and don’t know if I’ll find a similar paying job when I do, rent/food costs rising). I’m not overly concerned with those per say as I’ve become accustomed when attending school to live as close to spending $0 as possible but obviously that’s not sustainable. It’s just conflicting and I’ll probably wind up just contributing less over time to saving’s and more to investing but I don’t know exactly yet.",finance,1657381860
CryptoCurrency,Why crypto is set for another dip with BTC going below $14k,"In the midst of the bear market everyone is waiting for the capitulation phase to finish and a new bull run to ATH to start in hopes they will scoop up assets at low price and make a killing. I think we are set for a series of dips that will keep on dipping to below $14k and maybe even in to the range of $3-6k per BTC.

1. Rising costs of living (value of fiat currency rapidly declining) are yet to properly kick in with food prices estimated to rise anywhere in the range of 3-7x after true costs of this years harvests are fully known, not to mention fuel prices increasing constantly (petrol, gas, electricity). Vast majority of households will be struggling to sustain themselves and will be first liquidating assets before they default on their debts due to the above and interest rate hikes, thus pretty much removing retail investors presence from the market and robbing them of all their savings.
2. Property bubble is approaching its limits and is set to burst, as both new builds and purchases are declining globally, with large developers already in debt with nowhere to offload, while on a business model that can’t be sustained (property prices always increasing).
3. Points 1 and 2 combined will decimate not only civil population financially, but will make large financial institutions collapse wiping out other participants from the big leagues, domino effect which we have seen with Lehman Brothers. Pension funds will be affected.
4. Short sentiment amongst big players with miners holding on to their proceeds in hope of higher price while most of them are struggling with cashflow and network hash rate has been declining indicating rigs getting switched off (RIOT has 4x while HUT 3x higher mining costs than HIVE - $20k and $15k vs $5k).
5. Calls for tougher regulations mean closing window of opportunity for large moves wild wild west style.

The 5 points above paint a fairly grim future. Most notably in recent days collapse of several large DeFi projects and crypto investment firms.

This brings us to Celsius. A fairly big player. They have been repaying their loans in order to recover posted collateral (nearly $1bn). To me it indicates that they are expecting (most likely via insider knowledge of trouble at other firms or maybe even lawmakers) a further substantial drop in the markets and are doing everything they can not to have their collaterals liquidated.

Why are they doing this if MVRV and NVT amongst other indicators are pointing to an imminent bull market within the next 3-6 months? Rising price of collateral will not put them at risk of liquidation.

Market cap vs Realised cap is nearly at par, clearly indicating that true BTC value at this moment is around $23k, so we should have technically reached the bottom.

While staffing levels and debt restructuring are where you start when your business is failing, I don’t think that’s it in the case of Celsius and we are set for a bull trap to further capture wealth at big discounts from retail and visiting investors, as well as opportunistic VC and less savvy traders.

I know this might not be a popular view and many are waiting for the rebound, but it’s a realistic assessment of the situation based on month’s of analysis of current macro situation. Let’s see what you all think and be safe.",cryptocurrency,1657384153

CryptoCurrency,"How is customer assets protected? - a primer on FDIC, SIPC, and regulations","Honestly, I have seen a lot of misinformation about Voyager and their FDIC claims.  I posted this on another less pro-crypto subreddit (which I'm not sure if I can cross link to), but I hope it is helpful to pro-crypto people to understand some TOS and ad words since people in this sub are more likely to be affected.

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer or an expert in law in any way. Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.

**FDIC only covers banks in case of bank failure (aka insolvency leading to the state or feds closing your bank).**

Most people on this sub knows this, but you can only be member FDIC if you are a bank. Paypal does not have FDIC insurance, nor does Vanguard for example.

Otherwise, if you are a brokerage like Vanguard or Fidelity, you can be member SIPC, which is a similar insurance for brokerages that deal with securities. SIPC coverage is great because it’s $250,000 for lost/missing securities, and another $250,000 for cash in a customer’s account that’s not yet invested in securities. SIPC restores customers’ securities and cash assets when the brokerage firm liquidation begins, but obviously doesn’t protect against loss of value.

Firms that sell securities are REQUIRED BY LAW (SIPA 1970) to be member SIPC. Too bad Voyager likely couldn’t have been member SIPC because crypto isn’t currently regulated as a security. Side note: too bad Voyager isn’t member FINRA, so customers can’t easily bring cases against Voyager’s management of their assets.

**Pass-through FDIC, it exists but it’s up to the companies to ensure compliance, not the bank**

This is what Voyager claims as FDIC insurance. It is commonly used by brokerages through “money sweep” accounts, as well as other not-banks-but-holds-your-money entities like Paypal. Pass-through insurance means that the FDIC coverage passes through the third party (such as Voyager) that established the account to the customer who is considered the owner of the funds.

Voyager’s customer USD is FDIC-insured (against the member FDIC bank failing) so long as it is in Metropolitan Bank and Voyager has met the pass-through requirements. The only thing Metropolitan Bank does is maintain on their ledger a line that says something to the effect of “Customer funds with Voyager as custodian” and the banking services associated with that omnibus account.

Metropolitan Bank do not know and do not care (because it is not their obligation) what Voyager has on their ledger as being in that omnibus account. Whether it says Customer A - $1,000 or Customer A - $10,000 is up to Voyager. They only need to know “Customer funds with Voyager as custodian” - $235 million or however much that omnibus account has, and to maintain that properly. Voyager as their customer’s agent and custodian of the omnibus account has full ability to move customer funds.

It would be against SEC, rule 15c3-3 for Voyager to move customer funds in this sort of account to meet margin calls, but that is different than Voyager actually not being able to do this. Also whether Voyager is even subject to rule 15c3-3 is debatable, given they are not member FINRA and they aren’t under securities regulations formally.

The FDIC requires the bank to calculate FDIC insurance coverage for all depositors in the event of bank failure. Voyager customers count as depositors in Metropolitan Bank for this purpose (per the Voyager TOS and MCB’s statement), but importantly, the Bank does not need to have this information on hand unless the Bank fail. If that were to happen, the Bank will at the time of failure ask all of their third party accounts like Voyager or E-trade or Paypal to submit their ledgers, and the FDIC will review these accounts. Of note, if the bank fails and the ledgers are not properly maintained by the third party or the pass-through was improperly setup, the third party’s customers are screwed.

**SEC 15c3-3 and why retail holders really should want regulations.**

Rule 15c3-3 requires brokerages to keep customer’s cash separate from their own, as in Voyager can’t dip in customer’s cash to pay for their expenses (if they were a FINRA broker, which they are not). Customer cash can only be used to buy customer’s securities purchases (and if crypto were securities, then crypto purchases). This account is protected from being included in the bankruptcy estate.

Of note, it also requires member FINRA brokerages to balance their books so that if the amount they owe to clients and the amount that clients owes them doesn’t match, they will need to lock up a portion of their funds in a “Special Reserve Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers,” which is then protected in the event of liquidation. This rule was tightened after Lehman and MF Global went under.

Brokerages that follow these rules should be able to return all the securities and funds it owes to customers, but if the brokerage did not do this (and MF Global did not; they used customer funds to meet margin calls), the SIPC can liquidate the brokerage and under SIPA, all securities customers come BEFORE any other types of creditors. If the funds are still insufficient to return 100% of the amount owed to securities customers, SIPC insurance kicks in.

This is unlike crypto where you’re just an unsecured creditor and last on the totem pole.

**Separation of customer assets and bankruptcy. If a company does this, customer funds should be safe from being part of the bankruptcy estate.**

If Voyager truly did separate out customer USD and held them in bank account that they didn’t dip into when the strings where tightening (despite not being required to other than by their TOS because they aren’t regulated by the SEC/FINRA; and only if their TOS didn’t allow them to rehypothecate customer USD), then that money is 1) supposedly still in Metropolitan Bank where it is FDIC protected against the Bank collapsing through pass-through FDIC insurance, and 2) would not be available for the bankruptcy estate as it would be considered customer assets, not company assets. #2 is the mechanism by which commodities are protected since they are not included in SEC/FINRA/SIPC. It’s also how Paypal protects your assets in your Paypal balance account if they went under.

stocks,"Is there any bullish argument for Twitter? I kinda see it as a ""boomer stock"" that is actually losing money.","Twitter is a company that is still not profitable with  recorded 221 million net loss in 2021. Nearly 90 percent of its revenue comes from ads and another 10 percent are generated by data licensing, as they call it, which are custom services that are offered to corporations. Since its foundation, no executive has found another reliable way for the company to make money and that is bad, since its user growth is slow to say the least. Twitter tried to make some partnerships with TV networks in the past to generate more engagement, but that experiment was not very successful. The company's monetizable users grew by only 24 percent from 2019-2021 in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. This figure is dwarfed by the other tech giants and they are way, way more diversified than Twitter. Actually, the Twitter situation might be even worse than Netflix's, cuz at least NFLX is somewhat profitable, has a better business model and there is at least some hope that they might continue to grow in the future by making higher quality productions, charging customers more or expanding into streaming.

If the court rules in favour of Elon, I can't see any bullish argument about this company. What is your opinion?

Edit: Since a lot of people misunderstood me and are commenting that Twitter is not a boomer stock.

personalfinance,Can someone here help me get my head straight about when to buy a house?,"I am selling my house of 12 years, closing at the end of the month, for $95k. That will pay off the home equity line that I have on the house plus all of my credit card debt leaving me with about 20,000 cash which I could use to pay off a low interest loan I have from a family member or just set aside as savings, or use as a down payment. I otherwise have minimal savings, just an emergency fund and some retirement accounts I don’t look at. 

Meanwhile, I am self-employed with a variable income. I know that I am able to qualify for a mortgage right now based on my 2021 tax return, but I am fearful that my 22 tax return may end up showing a smaller net profit for the business. Plus my Covid EIDL will go into pay status and that will make my profit and loss statement look a little worse at that point. 

I have a house picked out in an area where I would very much like to live, and it is suitable to my needs and checks a lot of important boxes. However, it is not totally perfect, and the inspection showed many potentially costly problems. Thing is, I know I am going to qualify for the mortgage, at a kind of acceptable rate (4.75) which may not be the case next year or the year after. 

I am 41 years old and very much want to get to the next stage of my life, particularly living in my “forever home.” But I am really worried that if I wait a year or two, any number of problems could come up. Interest rates could get even higher. Prices of properties and building could go up even further. Even if property costs come down on average across the country, the “exurb” areas I am looking at could still go up as there is no sign of demand slowing among remote workers leaving cities. And of course, I may not be able to qualify for a mortgage next year based on certain trends in my business (revenue slightly down for various non-alarming reasons, costs up because of intentional moves that will take years to pay off). I also really just hate being a middle-aged man living in a second-rate rental while I’m trying to date to find a partner, which I’m a decade behind on sue largely to having been living for twelve years in a city where everyone I dated saw me as a flight risk (and they were right). 

The numbers support waiting *unless* market conditions get worse. My rent is very affordable and after the sale of the old house I’ll be in great shape to start putting a ton into savings, even after cutting my salary in half to further invest in growing the business. I should be able to put about $16k in the bank over the next year if I do that, *plus* the 20k I’ll have left from the house sale, and of course much more if I don’t slash my salary (at least $40k possible). So, in a year I’ll have a larger potential down payment, but the total budget is a crapshoot depending on what business looks like over the next six months. 

I just need someone to help me believe that waiting a year is more likely to result in a better deal than worse.

The organization that provides the policy is really disorganized so I'm having trouble actually understanding the paperwork I do have and finding additional paperwork in my online account. 

As for student loans, I have about 75k remaining in federal loans. I'm trying to take advantage of there not being any interest until September for all federal loans--so I'd like to make a big dent in the amount I still owe. Hence me eyeing my life insurance. 

I don't think I need a life insurance policy, unless I'm wrong? My other source of confusion is not understanding how much I would receive if I surrendered the policy. Would it be about the same as the death benefit? Would I need to pay taxes on the amount I receive--what amount is used to calculate taxes owed? 

Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1657394250

personalfinance,Student needs help with deductions for Rollover IRA to Roth conversion,"Hello,

I’m a college student in Texas that has a Rollover IRA from a previous job in another state. Due to the flux of hours I receive from working as a Student Worker, I’m somewhere between the 10% and 12% tax brackets (as best I can tell). The state of Texas does not have income tax, but I also have no federal taxes withheld from my paychecks, likely due to my position as a student. I’m looking to transfer my savings (about $3k) from my Rollover to my newly created Roth, but came across an issue that I need some advice on.
Aside from any fees due to early withdrawals, I know that when I transfer the money to the new Roth, I will have to pay taxes on the money (which is fine). The company I am using for the IRA gives me options to have additional withholdings for the transfer between accounts, which I would like to use to ensure I don’t have to pay taxes out of pocket at the end of the fiscal year. However, I have concerns about what percentage I should be withholding in my paychecks/IRA transfer considering my student status and also the tax bracket I may or may not fall into. I am also aware that withholding too much money can cause problems with the IRS, which I would very much like to avoid. Can anyone offer me advice on this? I would be more than happy to answer any questions that would help you to help me.",finance,1657403153

personalfinance,"Loan/Debt consolidation advice, I don't have enough education on this","Please be kind, it's been rough lately and I honestly just need some gentle guidance to figure this out. 

Recently, I have decided that I want to try to apply for a UsdA loan (I am in Oregon) to try and purchase my own home so I can get out of a not so great situation that isn't entirely safe. My credit WAS good; definitely above six thirty required to qualify, and getting better after working hard.

Unfortunately, life takes unexpected turns. 
A few months back, I had a legal name change, which is important to mention because it's part of the issue. 
Shortly after updating so many things, I was temporarily out of work, after a sickness that took me out pretty heftily before that. Along with having to buy a new (used, from owner) car, and paying for work to later be done, the loss of income plus the existing bills, I am in a bit of a hole with my credit cards from having to use them more than usual, to stay afloat, which is obviously taking a hit to my credit.

I am just one income. I often make extra hours, but it is unfortunately not enough. I am just a lead preschool teacher, and even with a promotion to sub director, I am still struggling because of what's been mentioned prior. 

I am also having an issue where my name is not being updated with certain companies, despite reaching out to them weeks/months ago, and repeatedly. The process seems to be affecting things, and because of that, it looks like I cannot take a loan out to consolidate what debt I've unfortunately accrued. 
I have been checking experian especially, and since many lenders look at that, it saying my credit doesn't exist is a huge problem.
I am getting the same responses when I reach out to them in particular about this, that there isn't enough credit information because of my ""lack of credit history"" which is incorrect. My oldest credit card is maybe six years old. They filed a dispute on my behalf, nothing changed, and are still using the same wrong name. I have sent them all documentation needed. 
I have been dealing with this since May, when Experian reported ""You no longer have a Fico score"".
I have three cards, and the oldest is the only one that has updated within the expected time frame. I even received an updated card very quickly.

And yes, I have updated my credit card companies. I'm not really sure why this process is taking so long, as I legally changed my name beginning of April, and quickly updated my SS and State license.

I; of course could just ""wait it out"" and gradually pay it off, and I would, if my situation was better/not so serious. I'd like not to go into too much detail, but I don't have anywhere else to go. I am just trying to make the best of it. 

I have also considered a temporary second job, or a side hustle, but with my poor health and frequent doctor and therapy appointments, I'm not sure I can make enough time available for that to even make a difference. 

The debt is just the amount of a small loan, fifteen hundred- two thousand, but it's hitting me harder due to the severity of my living situation, and definitely hindering my chance at a move. 
I don't have any late payments, or recent delinquent accounts. 
I have been approved for smaller loans; five hundred - seven hundred; however, I don't find this to be worth it due to interest rates. I'd rather pay a higher interest on the correct amount knowing my credit will be better with the card again paid off. 

So, if you've read all of that; and I'm sorry it was such a novel 😅, could you offer advice, direct me, help me out on how I can figure this out? Suggest any loan services maybe? I understand that it'll be hard with the issues going on.
 Like my title says, I have limited knowledge on what I can do, and no one to really guide me that I actually trust. 
If there's anything I can do to at least put a dent in it, please let me know. 
I'm sorry if this comes off as a dumb question, but I appreciate the responses. 😁",finance,1657410402

Banking,Do I HAVE to open an Estate Account? (GA),"I'm an only child and my dad passed away, twice divorced, intestate without any insurance or actual assets (one wrecked truck; one 25-year- old junker), so I had to open a probate proceeding. I received my Letters of Administration with all reporting and bonds waived. My dad had no insurance, so I paid out of pocket for a burial in-line with his faith. He has a little over $12K in two accounts, but I am out $15K for the funeral plus plot, interment and perpetual care. The headstone is another $2K. In Georgia, the order of payment is funeral expenses, hospital bills, fed taxes, secured debt, and anyone else ([https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2020/title-53/chapter-7/article-4/section-53-7-40/](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2020/title-53/chapter-7/article-4/section-53-7-40/)). Initially the banker said, I didn't have to open an estate account, but she now says my dad had an unsecured loan for $6K and an Estate Account must be opened. It will take several days (???). Unless I missed something, the loan is unfortunate for them, but I'm still going to be in the hole on the funeral and I have the bills to prove it. Due to COVID, it's taken more than 8 months to even get to this stage. I'm paying interest on some expenses that I put on a credit card. She kept saying, ""...but what about other monies that would come into the account? You have to use that to pay his bills."" Yes, the funeral is first. There are no other monies beyond a $600 refund for his auto insurance. They have said if I close the account, they can only issue a check to the Estate. I am worried they are going to try to take this loan out of the estate account, regardless of the law. If I am forced to open it, can I just transfer the monies directly into my own account afterwards? I have zero interest in engaging in some kind of back and forth with them.

Edited: BTW, when I initially called them to report his death, they sent a demand letter to the estate for $1,200. I had never heard this $6K until today.",finance,1657417590

I owe $20,433 on the car. The dealership will give me $21,700 trade in value. However, the new car is slightly more so the new total car payment was going to be $578. I am not interested in paying that. Interest rates have shot up because of the government is trying to slow down inflation yadda yadda. The dealership said it would take $5000 down payment to get my payments to stay at $488.

I was messing with the calculator on the car companies site and notice if I chose to lease the car for 60 months,(which is how many months I would have on my car loan) It will only cost me an extra $10 a month. 

Is there any reason to not lease over buying the car? Will the dealership still give me the trade in if I am taking a lease oppose to buying?

stocks,Hidden value: European banks outside of the Eurozone,"I live in Hungary, and I have an account at the local branch of Erste Bank. In Hungary the local central bank is raising the interest rate aggressively, it is currently at 9.75% with more increases on the horizon to avoid currency devaluation. However the interest my bank pays on my deposits is a meager 0.01%. At first I was furious but then I noticed an opportunity here. If the bank collects \~10% interest on loans and basically does not pay interest on deposits, its earnings will skyrocket.

I have checked and the case is more or less similar in the neighboring countries outside of the Eurozone. In Poland the interest rate is at 6%, in the Czech Republic 7%, Romania 4.75%. Banks that operate in these countries will reap some hefty profits in the near future.

Erste Bank operates in Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and shows a whopping P/E of 5.29. Raiffeisen Bank operates in all of these countries and shows a P/E of 2.41, although it has a network in a lot of other countries, which might diminish this effect. OTP bank operates mainly in Hungary, with a P/E of 6.8 is a likely candidate, however its Russian assests might drag down its performance.

Am I missing something here or are these three banks hidden gems?

personalfinance,"I think I overpaid for a house, but just how badly?","My wife and I just closed on a house finally after being on and off the market for 2 years.  After some initial celebration and relief, I'm starting to feel some bad buyers remorse.  I'm here trying to gauge how much of my remorse is justified, and how much is just me overreacting. Seeing what reddit thinks of the purchase I made based on my circumstances and market.

The things that are making me feel buyers remorse:

1. After closing on the house I saw that the Redfin estimate on our house says that the sales price is ~15k over the estimate, which is how much over asking I offered. Meanwhile I'm looking at comparable houses in the app that sold recently in the area, and they've increased in value since they sold. It is quite disheartening to see others gain while we take a hit.


2. Redfin chart with value history seems less consistent than other homes in the area. There was a large spike up in value for this house just a couple years ago and has risen more aggressively, probably due to the pandemic/interest rates. While a similar spike is seen with other houses in the area, their spike is not quite as aggressive as the spike for our house. Makes me think our house is more susceptible to market trends than others, and concerned that it will drop more than others in a declining market.


3. Our offer was consistent with our previous offers (~3-4% over asking), but I think we bought this house in an uncertain transition in the market where houses just started to sell at or slightly above asking, rather than 3-4% above.  Most likely due to rising interest rates. Now things seem like they are consistently selling just around listing price. Feels like we got unlucky with buying during that transition phase.


4. The house was initially listed at 400k, then sellers dropped to 388k, and then dropped to 375k.  So the house was in the market for longer than usual for the market area. We were thinking maybe the sellers were also in a similar mindset where there was this transition in our market that hadn't quite settled in yet. Another reason I think we could have gotten the house with a lower offer than our 390k offer. I'll go into why we offered so much later.


A few things that I tell myself to make me feel better about the cost I paid:


1. The house appraised for exactly our offer. I'm not really sure how much that means. I'm not sure how much of the appraisal is just the guy saying, ""hey let's just cut these people a break."". I wonder if it would have appraised the same if the sales price was lower.


2. Saw a few other sales in the area with similar estimated values and sales price. Sales price was ~15k over Redfin estimate, so I don't think we're completely alone.


3. There were 2-3 other offers when we were thinking about our offer price, and the offer deadline was only a few days away. Usually when this happened on previous offers we lost with, the winning offer was probably more than what our offer was for this house in terms of above asking %.  Even though the listing price dropped from 400k, to 388k, to 375k, I was afraid the lower list price was just stimulating more competition, and there may have been offers in the 385k range. So we offered 390k.


4. When we were deciding our offer price our real estate agent says that's what she would have offered if she were buying. Not sure how much of that is her just wanting us to get in a winning offer so she can finally make some money off us.


5. There was a sense of urgency to get a house before interest rates went up further, and a my wife and I being sick of renting. We didn't want to risk losing on another one.


6. Redin has the zip code rated at 87/100 ""very competitive"". Not sure how much this means and how accurate it is.


7. We like the house more than the other houses that are valued for more. Now I guess this is the important one, but it sucks seeing other houses we personally feel aren't worth as  much, get valued higher.


What does reddit think? Is my remorse justified and I overpaid pretty badly? Or am I overreacting and should just be happy I got a house?

* 21 years old, no expenses, live with parents

I have basically 0 expenses, as my parents let me stay with them for free. I probably save just under 4k a month. I do take my family out to dinner occasionally and pay my own cell phone, car insurance, etc. and try to help out if a random expense arises as a ""thank you"". Even with my new income after graduating, I have done my best to save. My cash on hand would be higher, but I knocked out my private student loans right away (as in my entire paycheck would be gone for repayment \~2 days after I got paid).

I feel no immediate rush to move out, but would like to eventually get my own place.

solar,"Is this the best way to look at solar, financially?","People get caught up in ROI and buyback credits and while those are important factors, I think a bigger factor is the 25 year $/kWh. You take the cost of the system and divide it by the total kWh the system will produce over 25 years, taking into account system degradation. For cash systems after tax credit that usually comes in around 6¢-8¢. That is way less than any kWh rate you will ever see. Even if you factor in the highest interest rate financing for the longest term, it usually comes in around 16¢-18¢. Which is around what most new electricity plans are currently in Dallas. We all know utility prices will continue to rise, but the above cost per kWh for your own solar is fixed for the life of the system. Imagine if you got solar now and then in 10, 15, 20 years electricity rates are 50¢/kWh and you are only paying 17¢ because you financed with the most expensive option years ago. And these fixed prices don't include accounting for any buyback, which would bring the cost down even more.

CryptoCurrency,Market Red Pill - Why Fundamentals and Technical Indicators Don't Matter,"I will be covering a lot of topics in this post in no particular order. It is meant as a follow-up/sequel to [my previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vgumvv/the_anatomy_of_a_trend_why_nobody_ever_nails_the/) where I discussed the importance of understanding the **Market Cycle and Trend Analysis**. If your primary objective with cryptocurrency is to make money, then continue reading. If you are here for the technology or too busy to actively manage positions, then do your regular DCA and close Reddit.

**TLDR:** Cryptocurrency has become another speculation vehicle for institutions around the world. This is why it is more important than ever to learn how to read a price chart. Yes, most of Technical Analysis (TA) is hindsight 20/20. **The real value in studying TA is learning how to identify signals/patterns in real-time.** This way you can react in the present. You won't have anywhere near 75% accuracy, but you will most certainly avoid blowing up your account. That's a win. Your financial decisions will be grounded in reason. That is far from gambling and, therefore, also a win.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why should I listen to you?**  
Some of the recent 'Analysis' posts in this sub are discussing:  
1) Hypothetical gains if certain coins return to ATH  
2) Why the weekly RSI being at all-time lows means it is a good time to buy  
3) Creating an algo to find coins with 20x potential  
4) Abnormal volume signaling a bottom is in (when in fact it was just people exploiting no-fee trading on Binance)

No offence to any of those authors, but investing/trading in the markets is not that oversimplified. It involves much more study, analysis, understanding, and experience. That means learning to think for yourself and not following some social media furu/influencer who makes decisions for you. **Everybody needs to take responsibility for their own financial outcomes.** I learned this the hard way and hope that others avoid making the same mistakes I did in the past. 

I come from the school of thought that not all Technical Analysis is created equally. The most important concepts are related to **price action, market psychology, and supply/demand.** Everything else is open to interpretation and a matter of opinion. Below is a Canadian income tax stock slip for one of my trading accounts. It shows that I cycled nearly 1 million shares with a dollar value of $55m. Am I a whale? Certainly not. Do I put my money where my mouth is? I try my best to.

Well, because Bitcoin is viewed as just another tradable instrument at the risky end of the spectrum (high beta). Speculators are making money from price movements in both directions. **And they are employing the same techniques used to trade stocks, forex, and commodities for the last century**. Here are some recent events which demonstrate how institutions are driving moves in both Stocks and Crypto.

**B.** Pullback pattern failure: stops taken out overnight on April 6 gap (trap!)  
**C.** May 4/5 FOMC FOMO Fakeout: Market rallied into Close then gapped down next morning. Fooled many to go long with a false sense of security (institutions dumped onto retail)  
**D.** Afternoon of June 9: Market sells off before next morning's CPI print. 'Smart money' was getting out after technical support broke (8-day consolidation base)  
**E.** Inflation comes in hot at 8.6% and leads to multi-day sell-off, complete with professional gaps

**Learn How to Ride the Tide with the Whales**  
'Whales' profit from buying low and selling high (or shorting high and covering lower). It helps to view the market through the same lens of the actors who drive it, no? Most people who believe TA is 'astrology for men' have never traded a day in their life. They liken trading to gambling: random bets with random outcomes. **So explain to me how firms on Wall Street have been in business for decades.**

If you believe that the billions of dollars that flow in/out of global markets daily are driven by 'hunches', then I have a bridge to sell you. To think that institutions blindly decide when to initiate their buy/sell programs is ridiculous. Wall Street prefers that retail brush off TA as witchcraft in order to **fleece Main Street in both directions**. That's how they are profitable year after year, in all market environments.

So why does it matter that institutions use TA when deciding to trade/invest in a particular asset? Because that herd mentality is what causes markets to enter uptrends and downtrends. When the big players are in agreement on direction, that leads to fluidity. Clean price action forms patterns. **Patterns are predictable**. And the market loves consistency. This concept applies to Bitcoin, wheat, stocks, bonds, gold, alt coins, pork bellies--anything that is exchanged on an open market can be charted. Where there's a trend, there's a Market Cycle; the Psychology Cheat Sheet is indeed universal.

[Emotional stages of a Market Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/11tot2mbqpa91.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe8d640c3da25741e8bce614fad0ff1d768cdabc)

Somebody once said that *candlesticks and volume are the footprints of money*. The bigger the volume, the larger the shoes. **If you plan to involve yourself in a market, it only makes sense to understand what the shepherds--who guide the flock--are doing.** And I don't mean Ecuador buying 80 Bitcoin the other day. That's less volume than the prior 1-minute candle on Binance!. I mean the institutional money that created the bottom wick at $17.6k a few weeks ago. The same institutions who defended price at $18.6k to put the brakes on the intermediate downtrend.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamentals are the Real Fugazi**  
How many times have you turned on CNBC to hear talking heads opine about which assets to buy vs. sell. They are either late to the party or flat out wrong in their predictions. Putting buy ratings at the top of market cycles, screaming discount during sell-offs, and finally downgrading at the bottom. **It's comical but should be criminal.**

And you wonder why retail traders are notorious for buying high and selling low. Here's an example of how institutions sold Tesla's last earnings despite great numbers. Following the failed breakout in mid-March, that left a lot of trapped longs above $1100. Many were underwater for a couple of weeks hoping for a bounce. When price returned to their break-even, they sold. It's been downtrending ever since.

[$TSLA April 21, 2022 Earnings - 'Good' fundamentals used to trap Bulls into becoming exit liquidity](https://preview.redd.it/ahgjjrxsioa91.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=837563d9c929bb8b5244d86a263a4ec2b01e800f)

Any news, upgrade, downgrade, or macro event that is worth acting upon by institutions will reflect themselves in the charts. Bullish news? Show me the big green candlestick with above average volume. Bearish news? Then the market better be selling. If the piece of fundamental information didn't drive market participants to buy/sell, then it is utterly meaningless. **At the end of the day, ticks on the tape are what matters.** This is why I tune out forecasts, models, predictions, ratings, and news in general. Focus on the chart and cut out the middleman. The candlesticks will tell you how the market is reacting, not some guest analyst on a financial podcast.

Just for kicks, here's another one where Bill Ackman (CEO of hedge fund Pershing Square) thought that he could single-handedly halt the downtrend on **$NFLX**. After dropping 50% from ATH back in January, $350 seemed like a good value, right? It's down another 50% since then. This from a company that was supposed to be a Blue Chip!

[Ackman bets big on $NFLX during a downtrend and loses 36&amp;#37; in just 3 months. Took many retail traders down on the sinking ship.](https://preview.redd.it/jzv36je4koa91.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffaa93ea79529b5648beded10507cc9c709ce1d3)

&amp;#x200B;

**Price Action is King**  
All technical indicators use past price and volume as their inputs. There are countless formulas derived from these two objective measures. Thus, there exists an infinite number of combinations and permutations of indicators, each with a dizzying amount of settings. **This is why TA can be subjective and often lagging.**

Just because some oscillator has a value of x, or an index is currently at y, it means nothing unless the market acts upon it. A sloping trendline can be drawn numerous ways; Bollinger bands and MACD have many settings. Which moving averages to use? The Ichimoku Cloud covers the chart to the point where its unreadable. Spaghetti lines. Halving dates. Puell Multiples, S2F models. Dominance percentages, Pi-Cycle Bottom Indicators. Do you see where I'm going with this? **These indicators are a function of price and volume, not vice versa.** No wonder Technical Analysis has gotten such a bad wrap. There is no such thing as a Holy Grail despite how many people claim to have one for sale.

Let's discuss the objective aspects of a chart. Price is registered when real buying/selling occurred. Fact. Volume is how many units were exchanged. Fact. When displayed on a chart in the form of candlesticks, they paint the picture of supply and demand. These two forces are what drives a market. Fact. Again, it makes sense to **cut out the middleman** and focus on price action: what the market has done and is doing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Trend Analysis Refresher and Recap**  
So institutions drive the market and their actions can be seen by looking at prior and current candlesticks. Still with me? Good. Go to [my last post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vgumvv/the_anatomy_of_a_trend_why_nobody_ever_nails_the/) for a crash course on pivots and trend structure. Everything beyond here won't make sense without a basic understanding of the **Market Cycle**.

**---\[INTERMISSION\]---**

At the end of each impulse/retracement leg there lies an **area** where price reversed. That inflection point is called a pivot. It takes **a lot of buying/selling** to halt and reverse price like that. This means institutional money. What do you think happens when price comes back to that area again? Many things are possible, including:  
1. People who recently bought/sold are back at break-even  
2. Traders get a second chance to add at the same price  
3. Bagholders can minimize their loss after being underwater on a wrong bet  
4. Price is deemed to be a good value after retracing a certain percentage  
5. Anyone who exited too early and missed out are able to FOMO back in  
6. Etc. etc.

There are entire book chapters that cover the emotions and psychology behind pivots and trends. I won't get into it here, **but it explains the why:** the reason that active trends tend to continue and why support/resistance areas are often respected. It's like the market has a collective memory when a prior price is revisited. Professional traders put their faith into these concepts. The more who act, the more likely these patterns come to fruition.

[Uptrend: Forces of Demand are greater than forces of Supply](https://preview.redd.it/rlicm3u7roa91.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b9a510d21c4265ccea02a87fcd32a4ecf7f7b33)

[Sideways: At the upper\/lower bounds of a range, forces of Supply equal forces of Demand and causes price to retrace](https://preview.redd.it/g8aew1tasoa91.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=273f1ab66ed09390cd22b284ca5012597bc849fd)

Ever notice how the absolute top/bottom is only realized in hindsight? It is an inflection point which ended up being the apex of a trend. This is why it is nearly impossible to buy at the very lows and sell at the very highs. **The trend is your friend: please don't fight it.**

In the last post I stated that retail has no problem buying during a Stage 2 uptrend. The issue is that they fail to sell during a Stage 4 downtrend. Believe me, the HODL mentality predates Crypto by centuries: Bitcoin just popularized it into a meme. Here are some graphics I dug up which demonstrate this phenomenon in the context of a Market Cycle. 

[The Market Cycle - Playing the Stages incorrectly due to lack of understanding](https://preview.redd.it/tksf874smoa91.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72575e7e356d0ddb49716f832f54e6a248afca5d)

**Uptrends and downtrends exist because institutions are buying during Stage 2 and selling during Stage 4 (correct areas).** The active trend continues until they stop doing this. Remember: institutions move markets. **Herd mentality.** Our little buy/sell orders have no impact on the price.  


**Pattern Based Trading**  
By now you probably realized that I am a believer of price action and trends. This simplifies my actions down to 3 general strategies:  
1. During a Stage 2: buy the Pullbacks and Breakouts  
2. During a Stage 4: sell the Rallies and Breakdowns  
3. During Stage 1/3: wait patiently for the range to be broken and get onboard the ensuing trend

Do these patterns work 100% of the time? No! When they do work is the potential profit greater than the amount risked? Yes! **These two sentences are the key to successful trading.** Let's leave that topic for another day.

Each pattern/setup has many requirements which improve their reliability. For educational purposes, here are a few examples which are relevant. By studying dead charts, you know what to look for and can better identify the price action in real-time. 

**The Breakout Failure -** Typically signals the end of a Stage 3 Distribution Phase and Beginning of Stage 4 Downtrend. Also known as the *Wyckoff Upthrust* or *Wyckoff Spring*.  
**What:** Price breaches a prior high and then fails  
**Why:** Sucks in longs and creates trapped traders. This fuels selling momentum on the way down; panic leading to fear, leading to more panic and fear. Herd mentality.

**The Consolidation Breakout/Breakdown -** Typically a continuation pattern in an active Stage 2 or Stage 4  
**What:** Price consolidates sideways after a directional move. Once floor/ceiling of the range is breached, trend resumes  
**Why:** Thin volume as institutions are not interested in dead action. Once stops are taken out at the bottom/top of base, then money pours in/out to ignite the move

**When Will Crypto Bottom**  
If you made it this far then I still have your attention. You are probably wondering when I think $BTC will bottom. The answer to that is: **I don't know and won't pretend to know**. My job is to react and not predict. To wait for confirmation by analyzing new information that the market provides after each candlestick dies and a new one is born.

That being said, price action will give clues as to when a bottom has been put in. I believe that it will occur either one of two ways:

**#1. Long drawn out Stage 1 Accumulation phase like we saw in 2019**

**#2. Sudden Climactic Reversal like we saw in March 2020 (alongside Stocks)**

I just have a not so simple question. I gross $62k a year and am able to live in a LCoL area of the country. It nets to roughly 3,800 rounding down. I should be able to increase my income within a year, but I'm not sure by how much. Hopefully 10% at minimum.  That's my goal anyhow.

Anyhow, I'd like to buy a home, but I'm not sure how much I can afford, especially since there are so many hidden costs to housing. I hear 3x your yearly gross income. I hear 25% of your net monthly income should be your mortgage. Id like to hear from people what might be realistic for me.

Sidenote, but important: I have cold feet about buying due to the craziness of the market. Someone in my area bought a home for 100k in 2019. In 2021, his neighbor sold a home for 160k, and it wasn't but two weeks on the market. I hardly see anything that cheap now. And it's alarming to see that barely one year later, houses went up more than 50%. I feel like I'd be getting ripped off, even if I can afford. But again, some say this is the new normal, some are calling for another 2008-style crash. With interest rates going up, I hope prices will accordingly decrease. Not necessarily crash, but balance out.

Finally, my lease is up in Jan 2023, so I *can* wait for a bit. I'm not so sure things'll be better by then though. It's looking that I'll have to sign for another year, especially since it's hard to find a decent place to rent anymore.

Any advice from you all would be appreciated.

I make about $2.5K a month and rent is $1,249.

I have no safety net currently. Here’s the situation. I make all my payments and have never missed one. 

I also used to invest int crypto and have made money back then before my bad habits. I invested about $1k into Ethereum which I converted into ETH2.0, that gains 3.25% and I’ll get it all when the Ethereum merge happens. At current rates I have just about $2k. My plan was to sell it all when the merge happens (that’s the only time you can sell because it’s locked). This should hopefully occur before September. 

My question is, do I continue making payments like I do now and save the money I make from selling the Eth or do I pay off all my credit cards then just make payments on my loans? Chances are that by the time the merge happens and I sell, I’ll have paid off a good chunk of my credit cards.

Tl;dr- My wife and I want to stop renting in the city and buy a house out in the country in another state and are woefully lost.

Some background info for yall... My wife and I have been married for 3 years and rent a townhouse in the Chicago suburbs. We've taken a few trips and vacations out to the country, and my parents still live on their farmhouse in rural Illinois. We love the quiet small town life. We envy it so much that we've decided we want to take a leap. 

We figure that we've been waiting for a bad market to get better for almost 2 years so we could buy a house, but it's just not happening. And we were never sure we wanted to stay in the city long anyway. With remote work being available to her and my skillset being in demand everywhere, we figure moving now is as good a time as it'll ever be!

Unfortunately,  we're overcome by the intricacies of the world we're stepping into. We don't understand how the various types of mortgages could benefit or hurt us. We don't know where to look for home buying assistance programs. We don't know how to check if we qualify. We don't know whether we need 3% down and 3% for closing cost or 20% down and 10% closing cost. 

Moving out of state (to Missouri hopefully) presents all kinds of its own challenges, but where do we go or who do we talk to about these kinds of questions? If we talk to local realtors they try to sell us a place and worry about securing the financing later, but if we talk to a bank I'm not sure we can trust them to do what's best for us and not what's most profitable for them. Combine this with possible federal loans or USDA loans because it's rural, and we have a seaof questions.

Then when it comes to buying some homes, there are places out there that don't have inspectors or code books. I have a ton of knowledge in these fields but it's not all encompassing.  How can we tell if the value of the property is right if there's not much comparable history for sales in the area and the buildings might be hiding some horrible defects that would otherwise be caught and fixed during an inspection?

# More Detailed

Hi everyone,

I've been following this subreddit for a while and I've learned a lot, but I was hoping to get some guidance specific to my situation. I'm 22, I just graduated with a B.A. in Chemistry, and I'm incredibly thankful to have the opportunity to save money by living at home with my mother for one year, paying only $100.00/mo in rent. I'm on my third interview for multiple jobs paying a yearly salary between $55-62k, so **I expect that my monthly income will increase from $1,500.00/mo to $4,320.00/mo within the next couple of weeks**\*\*.\*\*

That being said, I want to make the next year count financially, and I would greatly appreciate if any of you could help me create an ""order of operations"" pertaining to my specific situation. My mom struggles financially, and I want to do what I can to ensure that she does not have to help me with my expenses whatsoever by the time I move out.

|Checking Account|$470.36|Current income is $1,500.00/mo, but I'm now seeking jobs with my degree and I'm in late-stage interviews for multiple jobs with a yearly salary between $55-62k. I expect that my monthly income will be $4,320.00/mo within the next month.|
|Savings Account|$305.00|5% APY on first $500.00, 0.25% APY on all funds over $500.00|

|Student Loan 7 (unsubsidized)|–$2,000.00|2.75% interest rate, $10.86/mo minimum payment|

*In summary:– The total of my assets is $26,347.69 (this includes my car, a 2022 Mazda CX-30 2.5 S; my down payment was $7,542.00)– The total of my debts is –$41,786.67– This makes my total net worth equal to –$15,438.98*

All student loans are federal, and I have elected to pay them back using the graduated repayment plan because it's– *for the present–* the most affordable option; my reasoning is that I can always make additional payments. I am confident that my income will increase steadily but being fresh out of college, I don't want to struggle to meet a minimum payment.

cybersecurity,"Have a serious moment of Vindication now, but despite wanting to act on it, cooler heads prevail and I’ll just enjoy the moment.","So, back about the beginning of May, I get a call from a recruiting/headhunting company to inquire about my job search; we’ll call them Mary. I had recently updated my resume on the market, and they wanted to get a good idea of the types of roles I was looking for. Fairly standard stuff. She sends a questionnaire over, and asks me to fill it out. 

The next evening, on the phone, I explain how I’ve been an ISSO for quite some time, and would like to break into an ISSM - I feel quite comfortable with the standards of policy, foundational knowledge (especially with regard to the NIST), and how to effectively determine risk posture based on system operating parameters. In other words, I’m willing to learn, and absolutely don’t know everything, but I’m confident in my abilities. 

Anyway, as we continued to talk, the question of salary came up - being in the industry for a little bit, I know that compliance positions can be particularly competitively compensated, especially because they aren’t exactly well-sought-after for our more technically-minded colleagues. I gave what I felt was a competitive, but fair, starting point for negotiation at 205k - and naturally she balked at the number (“naturally”, since I’m kinda used to these types of “placement” recruiters to do so). Any rate, after *literally* laughing, which was pretty wild and a new one for me, she then said “well I don’t think anyone is going to take you seriously with an expectation like that.” 

I felt I was able to stay polite, and thanked her for her time, and said I understand if that sounded unreasonable. I asked why she felt that way, so that I could get a better idea of what strengths or experiences I should highlight to better justify the salary. Her response was what rather irritated me: “Well, no one is going to pay someone of your age that much; and as a matter of fact,  I just put someone in for that salary, and they have as many years of experience in the industry as you have years of life, ha ha” (for reference, I’m 30). She continued: “why do you feel that anyone would pay that much?” 

I gave her the analogy of post-9/11 defense contracting, and how in a similar situation, the cybersecurity industry has grown in both compensation measurements and perceived value from a policymaker perspective (especially after the Colonial Pipeline incident). This has correlated to pretty significant pay expectations in the field, especially in federal compliance. It’s a critical-fill role, and I felt the salary expectation was in the ballpark. She told me that she knows what she’s doing, and has been recruiting in IT Security for 25 years. Fair enough. 

All of this is fine, but the last part is what had me heated and honestly upset (off of the phone, anyway): she says “I’ll still put your resume out there, but I wouldn’t expect anyone to take you seriously and contact you - maybe I’m wrong, and maybe it’ll rain out here in the Midwest…but I wouldn’t bring an umbrella to work with me tomorrow.” 

I am now week-two of a Senior-ISSM position making $215k; from a recruiter that contacted me directly, outside of the above referenced interaction. Now I *really* want to send a screenshot of my next paystub with an umbrella emoji to Mary saying “looks like it rained” - but I’ll take the boring “thank you for the opportunity, but I’ve taken a different role” stamp, if I hear back. 

My point is this - our profession *is* in high demand. If you feel that you justify a certain compensation expectation, and can back that justification up with *legitimate* experience, academics, certification, and/or references, never settle for something you feel isn’t valuable to you. Someone gave me this advice when I started looking around, and it held up. If you can afford to wait for an opportunity that fairly compensates you, I recommend at least trying to.",technology,1657486230
solar,Need advice about pricing,"Hello everyone,

I am thinking of installing solar panel in my house. I got two quotes from SunPower :

1. **5.52 Kw** : 13 panels 425W with cost $23,923 without credits. With 6K credit, this is going to be $17,703. Price per watt (ppw) comes to be $3.21 after federal credit.
2. **4.79 Kw** : 11 panels 435W with cost $20,672 without credit. With 5K credit, cost goes to $15,297. Price per watt (ppw) comes to be $3.25 after federal credit.

As a reminder, this doesn't include batteries :( 

With all gossips of NEM3.0, does it even makes sense to go solar without batteries? Even without batteries, ppw is more than California state average of $2.7. Is sunpower worth that cost or do I need to look elsewhere. If so, can I have some recommendations please ? Thanks in advance.",energy,1657486398

personalfinance,I'm only 20 years old. I'm overwhelmed by debt and don't know where to start,"Hi Reddit, 

As the title says, I have quite a bit of debt that I'm looking to pay off as soon as possible but with my current finances, I've felt stuck for a long time. I'll lay everything out below. 

I'm a 20-year-old college student who prior to attending college in the fall of my freshman year, had my budget/finances planned out well. I had managed to receive almost a full ride between both merit and need-based aid from my school and the fed government. 

For the most part, my first year went relatively smoothly. I left freshman year with only $3,000 in FAFSA loans, and no credit card debt. I had two cards that totaled a $2,200 limit. Because I was in a good place financially, I was able to pay off all, if not most, of the entire balance each month. I didn't have much credit history (only about 5-6 months), but by the end of my first year, I was at around 650-680 for my credit score. 

After freshman year is when things went to shit. The freshman dorms were SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than the other dorms on campus. $9,000 for room and board quickly skyrocketed to $16,800 after switching. I decided to drop the meal plan to accommodate this, under the impression that I'd save much more buying and cooking my own groceries than I would by keeping the $5,000 meal plan. On top of this, I lost the pell grant that I had received the year prior due to a change in my mother's salary (although not by much). I just barely surpassed the threshold which made me lose $4,000 in aid. 

When the bill came out for the first semester of my sophomore year, I owed almost $6,000 WITH financial aid applied. With a measly $12/hr work-study job I was finally able to find, and groceries to pay for, there was no way I would be able to pay that on my own. My parents were not financially able to help with the bill and I had to figure things out myself. 

I had a summer job leading up to the fall where ideally, I would have started saving, but the cost of transportation ate away at my paycheck where I was making only $9.25/hr. By the end of the summer, I was up to about $1,000 in credit card debt from ubers, expenses, and other transactions. I still had to pay for textbooks and required homework subscriptions for school. I was able to finesse one or two online textbooks, but the others were not online. This only added more financial stress. And with little financial help from parents, the debt quickly piled up. 

To sum things up, I ended up taking a $4,600 loan from Upstart to help pay for my tuition and fees but with interest, it's up to $4,900 now. One credit card is still open but maxed out at $1,000 with 15% APR. The second is now maxed out at $1,300 but closed at 6% APR. I still owe the school for the second semester as well and I'm currently carrying a $5,000 balance right now, which, fortunately, I can pay back after receiving my disbursement in the fall. I moved off-campus to much cheaper housing which is why I'll be receiving money instead of OWEING money for the fall semester. 

I think it's important to add that I live out of state, and it's only but so long before I'll need a car. Obviously my priority is resolving the debt first, but this is still something I'll need eventually. The school balance will be taken care of in the fall, but I'm stuck on how to handle everything else. I have several late payments on my credit file from last year and a horrible credit score. I also have several inquiries from when I tried to apply for loans to assist with school and secured credit cards to help build my score. My Upstart loan is now listed as a charge-off. Next month, I'll have an extra $1,000 I plan to use to start tackling this debt. Should I pay off the open Discover account since the APR is higher? Or should I use that money to pay off most of the closed account's balance? 

What should my next steps be? Should I settle the Upstart charge-off or gradually pay it down since it is no longer accruing interest? And what about my car? My current (and higher-paying job) is work from home, but I'm unsure of how long that will last. This financial situation has caused a lot of stress and had the largest impact on my severe depression over the last year. Any and all help would be appreciated. Please be kind.",finance,1657487764

personalfinance,Student Loans vs House,"Hello, 

I have a quick financial question for the experts on this sub.  I’m 27, and I currently have around $60,000 in student loan debt.  That’s split between a private loan and eight federal loans.  I currently make $74,000/year, and I moved back in with my parents in 2020 due to a layoff, and I now work remotely nearly 100% of the time.  I also have a 100% paid off car.  

My next goal in life is to buy myself a house.  My budget is $250,000 with a 20% down payment.  

I currently have two options.  Option one is to save up for a down payment now and keep making minimum payments on my student loans.  Option two is to make the most of my situation and completely pay off my student loans, and then go into the house buying process with zero debt.  

If you were in my situation, which route would you go?

(I have a feeling I already know what the answer will be)

tldr: pay off student loans before house buying begins?",finance,1657498493
vet,Changing a bad diet...,"So we got a underweight dog like a month ago and its previous owners fed her with ""rice and boiled chicken shreds""(I am not sure if it's a good idea). And even in that she avoids the rice and only eats chicken hence the underweight. 

We tried feeding her normal dog food, but she wouldn't eat it. When I sit with her and feed her with my hand she would eat like 15 or so and that's it. We even tried wet food but it was no good.

personalfinance,Holding on to an ee bond after maturing?,"I have an ee bond that is going to reach maturity in October and I know you pay federal tax on it. Right now I am in the 22% federal tax bracket, however if I cash out I am then moved up to paying 24%. I plan on hopefully getting pregnant in a couple of years and taking a year off or close to it to be with my future baby which would drop me to the 10% or 12% group (I’m aware tax brackets can change). This may be a dumb question but if I cash out 2 years after the maturity date while being on a leave of absence not receiving any income or very little, I would pay less in tax than if I cash out this October correct? Say this October the bond is worth $23,500 before taxes, will it still be worth that much in 2024? Thank you",finance,1657511788
personalfinance,Keep the old car or go newer? Details Below,"Long time lurker, first time poster: 

Background Information: 

25M, full time engineer in Oregon.  I make $65,720 annually and after 18% retirement (combination Roth IRA and 401k, and 16% going to a ""big future event savings"" and rent and utilities  and \~350 a month on gas and groceriesI.   usually have $1100 - $1200 a month to take home and do something with.  Subtract some for going out with friends for food &amp; drinks, bicycle improvements etc. 

(Sidebar kinda question - any recommendations for what do to with the excess money mentioned above? I always pay off my credit card bill in full each month, and never spend more than I make in a given month. This means usually rolling over anywhere from 300 - 800/monthly with it just sitting in a savings account.  Looking for low-effort, medium to long-term investment ideas.  Already have some index and mutual funds.  Could probably monthly contribute more there or more to retirement.  Sadly my company doesn't do 401k matching, but I do have stock options. 

Now for the car situation: I have a 2009 Subaru Forester with 173k miles.  Gift from my parents, totally paid off, and they actually still cover my insurance and registration (still technically in their names).  It's a manual transmission, new head gaskets, water pump, timing belt etc at 165k, new clutch at 125k.  A decent set of tires on it too.  It gets 28mpg, was just given a good check over by the dealer, and seems to be running well. I have a somewhat emotional connection, and have learned a lot from this car.  KBB says it's worth $4000 - $5400 to a private seller.  I don't do a whole lot of driving (bike to work most days) and drive to the store and to visit friends etc on the weekend. 

I also have a 2009 Honda Fit as a gift from my aunt that has 200K miles on it.  California owned its entire life, and runs perfectly. I plan on selling this car this month. It gets 40mpg which I feel will be an attractive selling point. KBB says it's worth $3400 - $5100 to a private seller. 

Someone I know is selling a 2016 Rav4  with 30k miles on it for $20k.  KBB says to a private party it's worth 22-24k.  Seems potentially tempting.  I really enjoy driving manual so before this opportunity came up I told myself my next car would either be a manual (before they go extinct) or a hybrid/EV if the technology is good enough.  If I do this I could potentially put down \~8k from the two older cars and maybe more.  Still undecided if I'd dip into other savings for this or just do payments on the remaining balance.   On a simple car loan calculator - with 60 months @ 4.5% interest, payments would be only \~200month.  I don't have a lot of borrowing history but I have good credit and a stable income.  Unsure what my actual interest rate would be, but I know they're going up.  

TLDR: In addition to selling the honda fit, should I sell my Subaru before something else inevitably breaks given its age?  This would give a conservative $8k to put towards the newer low-mileage Rav4.   Thank you  for reading this wall of text, hopefully it isn't too much!",finance,1657513791

Forex,Trying to short EURUSD from here ( w/ explanation ),"EURUSD has now broken lows that hadn't been reached in almost two decades. So that seems to get many people in the mood to go long. ""If EURUSD has now come that low, it must be time for a reversal"". In my opinion, that's pretty unlikely. Many european countries are extremely likely to go into a recession by the end of the year, possibly I'd even say a Global Recession if we keep sanctioning Russia. We'll by trying to completely cut them off by the end of the year 2022, which is in Americas interest as we'll now be getting a lil gas from there. ( And other countries like Qatar and Algeria. )

So in my opinion, the Euro has no chance of reviving itself and the Dollar will keep rising. Many see USD as a safe currency at the moment, even though the US economy is basically shit. It's still going to keep rising as the FED keeps increasing interest rates.

Salary / paid hourly 
Starting $60600($29.14)
In 5 years $69,200($33.28)

Filing Status
Single / 0 dependents

403b contribution pre tax(not including employer match)
At starting salary $11,211($216 weekly)
In 5 years $12,806($247 weekly)

Health benefits pretax
$2600($50 weekly)

State employed PA / Philadelphia 
Live in NJ but PA and NJ have a reciprocal agreement 

City of Philadelphia Tax 3.5%

The problem I’m having with online calculators is they want to know YTD federal taxes withheld. But I just want to know how much federal taxes I can expect to be withheld without having to owe. 

According to federal tax brackets I would be in the 22% tax bracket. 

Do I take salary / hourly x 22%?

$60,600 x 22% = $13,332 / 52 = $256.38 weekly?

economy,Austria - Germany - Russian Federation: business as usual,"On July 5, 2022, the Washington Post published a sensational article “[After invasion of Ukraine, a reckoning on Russian influence in Austria](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/07/05/austria-russia-infuence)”. Its main point is that while some European states - especially Poland and the Baltic countries - viewed Russia under V. Putin as a strategic threat, Austria and Germany were among those who saw Moscow as an excellent opportunity to build a prosperous business.

It was only the Russian attack on Ukraine that prompted Austrian lawmakers to investigation into Russian interference with its intelligence services, as well as Russian cooperation with Austrian companies such as the state gas giant OMV. The lawmakers are also looking into the business ties of senior Austrian politicians and parties with the Kremlin and Russian companies. As MP Stephanie Crisper candidly stated, for many years ties with Moscow have permeated Austrian politics, and now economic and political dependence on Russia has finally become visible to everyone as a security threat.

Everyone remembers the time when the Austrian Foreign Ministry was headed by Karin Kneissl (2017-2019) of the far-right Freedom Party, who has developed especially warm relations with the Kremlin (even sent its members on an official trip to Russian-annexed Crimea). It was then that Russian agents in Austria were developing a plan to reorganize one of the special services into a new department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (although this idea never came to fruition). The wedding of K. Kneissl on August 18, 2018 became the most obvious symbol of the attachment of the Austrian political elite to the Russian Federation. During the celebration, K. Kneisl happily waltzed with V. Putin. Two years after leaving the government, K. Kneissl took a highly paid position on the board of directors of the Russian energy giant Rosneft. In addition, she wrote her own column for Russia Today (the Kremlin's propaganda agency). Today she is forced to hide because of her background and even emigrated from Austria.

As WP journalists put it, a revolving door opened between the highest ranks of the Austrian government and major Russian state companies - ex-Chancellor of Austria Christian Kern was on the board of Russian Railways, ex-chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel was on the board of directors of Lukoil, etc.

Large Austrian companies are also closely intertwined with the Russian Federation, especially in the energy sector. For example, in 2015, OMV hired a new chief executive, Rainer Seele, a German citizen who was a strong supporter of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. As a result, Austria has become one of the biggest investors in this controversial German gas pipeline. In addition, it was under R. Seele that Austria became more dependent on Russian natural gas.

The WP article also colourfully describes the story of Egisto Ott from the Austrian internal security service, who is suspected of selling state secrets to Russia and providing information about the enemies of the Kremlin in the West. 60-year-old E. Otthas become a symbol of the deep penetration of the Russian Federation into politics, industry and intelligence in Austria. From 2017 to 2021, E. Ott collaborated with former high-ranking Austrian intelligence official Martin Weiss, as well as with Austrian businessman Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany and allegedly hiding in Russia.

Also, E. Ott was involved in the operation of the Federal Security Service of Russia for the cynical murder in the very center of Berlin in 2019 of a Chechen opposition figure.

Of course, the members of the Bundestag should repeat the current investigations of the Austrian parliamentarians and special services regarding the depth of penetration of Russian influence into the politics and business of Germany, as well as about the reasons for this phenomenon. As the American historian Timothy Snyder rightly noted in a public response to the German philosopher Jurgen Habermas, Berlin in its Eastern policy turned a blind eye for many years to the ever-increasing volumes of purchases of Russian hydrocarbons from a corrupt regime that was steadily moving towards [right-wing views, imperialism and neo-colonialism](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/juergen-habermas-and-ukraine-germans-hav%0ae-been-involved-in-the-war-18131718.html).

T. Snyder draws attention to the fact that already after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the German politicians made a conscious choice in favor of building Nord Stream 2 and increasing the dependence of Germany on energy exports from the Russian Federation. Today, even many SPD deputies already admit that this choice of German politicians had disastrous consequences. In fact, it turns out that the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, lobbied by Chancellor G. Schroeder, is now financing Russia's destructive war in Ukraine. For many years, G. Schroeder, and then his successor A. Merkel, described the unusually close cooperation between Germany and the Russian Federation in the field of energy with the phrase business as usual.

personalfinance,Cold feet with buying a house,"Recently went under contract on a townhome as a first time homebuyer and I've been having cold feet on and off. There's so many factors to consider and it's been really overwhelming. I'm also starting a new job so it's been stressful in addition to that. I had initially pushed for an earlier move for the shorter commute to the new job, which is why the timing of everything turned out pretty hectic. I'm wondering now if I should have waited to get settled first before looking into buying a house.

Some background:
- Gross salary: 155k
- MCOL area
- Have 20% down payment
- No debt
- 760 credit score
- Total monthly payment (including mortgage, HOA, utilities, etc.): ~$3500
- Price: 610k
- Rent in the same area is ~$2200
- Would be living with gf
- Townhouse is a new construction, 3 bed/3 bath, pretty close to two big metro areas/growing tech hubs
- Commute to work is ~20 min
- I plan to stay ~5 years but am also early in my career so not 100% sure
- Parents may move to this house if I move out. Otherwise I was thinking of renting it out.

Here's a list of pros/cons for buying that I came up, I'm new to all of this so apologies if I'm misunderstanding anything.

Pros:
- Tax deductions
- Good area, should keep/appreciate value
- Low HOA fee ($75/mo)
- Nice place to live near work
- Decent price as far as I know (~20k less than similar townhomes in the same neighborhood but 30k more than the median sale price of townhomes in the city)
- Interest rates might increase if I wait
- Money is going towards building equity
- Can eventually rent or sell if I move

Cons:
- Expensive monthly payment (almost 3x what I've previously paid living with roommates)
- Possible recession/housing crash (keep hearing a lot of people talk about this, but also that timing the market isn't a good idea)
- HOA fee could increase in the future? $75 seems really low and since it's a new construction I figure they will increase it in the future. I'm not sure how that process works though.
- Just starting new job, don't feel as stable
- Might lose flexibility to move if I stay less than 5 years
- Maintenance/repairs. There shouldn't be much since it's a new build and there's a builders warranty but in the future it could become an issue.
- I read that townhomes are harder to sell/rent than SFHs and are generally not as good investments long term.

Please let me know if I've overlooked any pros/cons. Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1657543374
Bitcoin,Risk of Bitcoin ETF's in light of current events (specifically BTCC.B),"**This is not a discussion of ""Not your keys, not your coins"".**

I am currently invested in BTCC.B - Purpose Investments Bitcoin ETF - non-currency-hedged. I decided to go this route to tax-shelter my bitcoin investment in a registered account.

Based on my understanding of how this ETF works, they purchase coins through a company called Genesis, and store their coins for the fund with Gemini Trust Company - apparently in cold-storage, blah blah blah.

**Here is my concern:** Gemini Trust Company strikes me as a risk. They also operate an exchange, and offer various products that allow you to earn interest on your crypto... which sounds a lot like the companies that have recently gone under.

Also, it specifically states in the terms of their ""Gemini Custody"" insurance agreement that unauthorized access of the clients account is not covered... to me, this sounds like if someone gains access to Purpose Investments custodial account, due to a fuck-up on their end, investors are fucked.

Has anyone else assessed these risks, and/or researched this at all? I'm curious.  


**Edit:** Well thanks everyone for completely derailing my bitcoin related question - should have seen this coming. Literally nobody answered any of the specifics in the post.

This sub has become far too political - I'll stick to the tried and true investment boards from this point forward. Good luck defeating international monetary policy - I'll keep playing both sides and hedging my bets.",cryptocurrency,1657545253

The QCell option isn't really going to cover my needs. To be fully covered I would need around 22KW

My concerns are:

LG stopped making panels. Would it still make sense to get an lg panel for a new install ?

Is the price right for such a large install ?

Is it worth to get iQ8 ? My installer is asking for additional $1600 for just the iQ8  inverter's not the transfer switch or any other parts. I am thinking about a generator which would cost me around an extra 10k(for now batteries are way to  expensive).

Anything else to be aware on a new system ?

solar,(MA) Tesla solar vs REC system - Is the cost savings worth it?,"I really could use some help on making  a decision here.

I'm currently debating between two solar systems \~ 14.5 kW systems producing \~ 16,250 kWh.  The Tesla system is $33,500 vs $50,500 for a REC alpha pure black 405 with Enphase IQ7+ microinverters system.  With Federal tax credits it is ($24,700 vs $37,300).  There are some other incentives that are equal and not fully guaranteed at this point, so for simplicity sake let's ignore them.  


The $13k cost savings is huge, but i do have concerns about the expected cost of inverter replacement should i need them. $5-7k each for the Tesla system as these only have a 10 year warranty(inverter, 25 years for panels).  The REC system is a 25 year warranty for both the panels and the micro inverters; they also can be warrantied by any REC certified installer.

I've heard of a number of issues with Telsa customer service, system repair time, and warranty replacements.  My personal experience with their sales/initial design team has been extremely poor (lack of technical knowledge, different answers to contract questions from different reps, incomplete and wrong knowledge of incentives, extremely difficult to contact).  My friends who are in the industry are also very anti-Tesla, but i would expect them to have a biased opinion.

So overall is the cost savings for Tesla worth the slightly inferior product, or should i bite the bullet and go with the REC system?",energy,1657551757

They just reached out and were asking if we were interested in using some of the home equity built up in our house to take care of other existing debts we have in order to save money on a monthly basis. After they went through all of the numbers, they think they can actually save us nearly $1,300/mo. This involves rolling the debt into the home mortgage at a slightly higher interest rate, but to be honest it sounds a little too good to be true and I don’t know if this kind of thing is a good idea or not.

Here are some numbers just to give more details to the question.

Current mortgage is $964 @ 3.375%

Other bills looking at rolling in:
Her car - $537/mo
My car - $759/mo
Multiple CC’s - $700/mo

All in all, the debt to be cleared is around $84k

New mortgage payment would be $1,741 @ 5.75%

They also said that if we just kept paying the mortgage like we were still paying all of those bills and putting the extra $1,300/mo toward principle, that the house would be paid off in 11 years.

We bought the house in 2015 for around $210k, but with home prices soaring, they say it should be worth $360-380k.

I have a chance this month to roll over my ESOP money from my previous job into a roth or 401k, but there is also an option to do a partial rollover.  


Money might be a little tight until I start getting paychecks from my new job, so I was thinking of doing an early distribution on a small portion of my stocks, and rolling the bulk of it into the 401k I already have. I'm not 59 1/2 so there would be an extra 10% tax, and I understand there's still state and federal taxes on top of that for the early distribution portion. My question is, since I haven't made any money this year, and will only be working 5ish months this year (starting new job in Aug), I'm going to be in one of the lower tax brackets for sure. At that point, would this be a better time to take a partial early distribution, then, say, if I made 100k in a year? That is, does the state and federal taxes on this early distribution work the same way as tax brackets for how much you made overall working for a company come tax time?

Also important: I know a common logic for paying down the CC (apart from avoiding interest) is that you then still have that amount available on the card to use so it's win-win.  BUT, my credit card gives a special lower interest rate for in-state businesses and all of my current debt is at that lower rate; there's no guarantee that any emergency use in the future would be in-state, and therefore might turn debt at a 7.5% interest rate into debt at an 11.5% interest rate.

Snaith said that the recession may be what is needed to solve the inflation problem.   A ""pasta bowl recession,"" due to its *low and shallow* shape.  

""While the recession may not be deep, he expects it to likely last four quarters – representing the wide part of the bowl. He predicts the mild slowdown should help the Federal Reserve bring inflation to heel while giving the global supply chain time to return to normal and allowing gas and oil prices to come down,"" a report from UCF says.

Other predictions:

Payroll job growth of 3.7% in 2022 will turn negative in 2023, fall to -0.3%, and fall further to -1.0% in 2024 before turning slightly positive at 0.6% in 2025.

Housing starts will decline from 1.6 million in 2022 to 1.4 million, then hover at this level through 2025.

11.4 million job openings will provide a shock absorber for the impact of the recession on the labor market. The headline unemployment rate is expected to rise from 3.6% in 2022 to 6.5% late in 2024 before beginning a gradual decline in 2025.

This is not a dramatic fall-out rate yet but I think it will be interesting to keep an eye on. It seems buyers are more likely to have contingencies and are either forced to pull-out (because of higher interest rates) or not afraid to pull out of a contract.

personalfinance,Schwab is not a good place to have your investment,"When people compare brokerages, people rarely speak out about the power of cash. Not that you should horde a lot of cash, but cash sitting on the sideline with no interest is not ideal.

One thing I have learned is that Schwab is the only (I think) traditional broker out there that doesn't automatically sweep cash for you. So you would have to manually move cash into money market funds. And honestly, what happened most of the time is you just left the cash sitting as cash, earning close to zero % interest rate.

On the other hand, fidelity, vanguard, and etrade (I believe) all automatically sweep cash for you. MMF at Vanguard is earning 1.44%. Swppx, Fdrxx at fidelity is 1.04 and 1.11%. The issue of manual swap is that if there is a big market crash and you want to deploy the money, you have to wait an extra day to move it from the money market to cash. So you lose the ability to buy in a big market downturn day at schwab.

Sorry for the ramble, but I learned this on the worst day in March 2020 when I couldn't buy because I had to wait one extra day in my IRA account (since IRA doesn't allow margin borrowing). In a grand scheme of things, it's probably nothing. But why waste energy and time on an inferior broker when there are better alternatives like Fidelity out there?

I just want to put it out there - because I have learned a lot from PF throughout the year. With the recent settlement of Schwab for ""cash drag"", you can tell not paying you interest on trillions of cash sitting on the side, even at 1% for Schwab is extremely profitable.",finance,1657595158

personalfinance,Renting vs. buying a house? (Aus),"I am based in Australia where real estate is seen as a 'safe' asset and investment. 

I work in the medical field. My job is pretty stable in terms of income (I am not making the big bucks). In saying so, it is unstable in the sense that I could be required to move around depending on the field I chose. 

I earn a decent income. 

I'm looking to move out with my partner as she is coming for at least a year on a visa. Given the circumstances (and me not having enough for a house deposit anyway), I feel like renting is the most financially responsible and reasonable. 

My Asian parents are highly against this though. They are under the mentality that buying is always better. My mum doesn't seem to realise that buying a house by myself especially with rising costs/interest rates is not necessarily the best choice? She is under the thought that if I'm moving out and renting, I am making a financially huge mistake as I am paying off someone else's mortgage. 

She has even floated the idea of buying one of their small units that they are still paying off. In fairness, I did float this idea a few years back (as a way to get them out of debt) but I was shut down by them as it wasn't a good investment in their eyes. At this stage, I don't see the point of me buying their unit (I don't even have enough for the deposit there, and the bank won't loan me enough anyway). Even if I could loan enough, I don't want to buy that house to not be able to buy somewhere which might be more optimal for my circumstances in the future. Furthermore, the repayments on the house would be more than renting. And with renting, I don't really need to be locked in for 20-30 years paying it off! My mum seems to think that I can easily 'sell it off in a few years'. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone provide some insight or thoughts?

CryptoCurrency,"The case for keeping some of your funds in reliable Crypto projects - stablecoins, Bitcoin, Eth. A bank in China is not letting customers withdraw funds and aren't saying why.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_FvmGTwsM - This video got big on /r/bitcoin yesterday. The following is the response that I posted as a comment in that thread as well:               

This is an excellent time to remind you about why it is a good idea to keep some of your money in bitcoin.              

When we see banks in a world superpower screwing people over with regards to their money - it's time to make sure you have your wealth in an asset that cannot be confiscated.                            

Some of you may be thinking, ""Oh but I mean China is communist, that's not a problem I would have in Europe or America.""                 

In case you don't know what a bail-in is, here's an explainer in 2 minutes, 12 seconds: https://youtu.be/j6aTCOjUaoU              

That last bit that Mr. Wolff said is not wrong, it is perfectly legal for banks to confiscate your funds to deal with their problems, both in America and the European Union: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090716/why-bank-bailins-will-be-new-bailouts.asp               

*The provision for bank bail-ins in the Dodd-Frank Act was largely mirrored after the cross-border framework and requirements set forth in Basel III International Reforms 2 for the banking system of the European Union. It creates statutory bail-ins, giving the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the authority to place bank holding companies and large non-bank holding companies in receivership under federal control.*                

This isn't some ""pro-bitcoin propaganda"". Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that getting some or getting none is a largely binary decision. No one here in this sub is trying to be smug with you, we are just avidly aware that we need to be hedging against very real possibilities.          

_______________________________________________________

Since not everyone here is a BTC maximalist, I'm going to just add in here that if you think putting your money in a volatile asset isn't a good idea, then you can consider properly collateralized stablecoins.

personalfinance,I’m 23 with 33k in debt and I make 20$/hr. Help !!,"So just as the title says i’m a big dummy. I just bought a car a couple months ago and have 22k left on it at an interest rate if 2.49%. I also have a personal loan at 10k with a rate of 6.49%. I work 38-43 hours per week which take home is about 550 per week. 

My rent is 300, and my car insurance is 216.86 per month. I spend about 140 in gas per month and yeah. 

What do I do? Id like to be debt free and move away at 25 (preferably sooner) This has taken an extreme mental toll on me and I don’t know what to do.

Sorry guys I forgot to add my budget 
My rough budget is:

Car Note 329.00
Personal Loan 226.00
Rent 300.00
Gas 140.00
Pet Care 200.00 (Some months not needed)
General Stuff 280.00

Bringing my expenses to 1,475

Is there anything I can cut out? Also I have 12,600 in my savings.

Also omg sorry another edit: So i’ve always looked at my savings as my eventual move out fund. 10k was my goal and now that i reached it, my idea was to stop putting money into my savings and use all my income going forward to pay off the debt and cover my expenses does that make sense? Is that a good idea?",finance,1657605176
personalfinance,HELP: Vanguard is holding my 401K rollover hostage,"Apologize if this is lengthy/ranty. I’m a first time poster but I genuinely have no idea what to do now.

I have been trying to get around $11K rolled over into my retirement through my new job and I have YET to see the check even though I’ve called 15 times since march. 

Every time I call and ask to speak to a supervisor, they say they don’t have one. Then they tell me I’ll see a check in USPS MAIL in 8-10 business days and it has now been FOUR MONTHS. That, or they say they are still working on it and I should see an email in three days updating me, which I never get. One time they said they would overnight it to me via fedex but I would have to pay the shipping and what was my fedex account number?! Shouldn’t they be the ones paying for this overnight since they made a mistake to begin with?!

Part of the issue here is that a check was originally sent via MAIL to fidelity (new provider) but somehow I was supposed to notify fidelity within five days of the check’s arrival in order to process the check even though said check had no tracking because, again it was sent via SNAIL MAIL. 
Another thing that really terrified me in this whole process is that in order to even get all this going, Vanguard had me sending a LOT of PII via mail in the form of an LOI OR letter of intent (how is this allowed/secure?!). And since it got to them, they claim they are still processing it. 

So here are my questions:
1) has this happened to anyone else out there?
2) how do I combat this/force them to give me my hard-earned money so it can start accruing interest again?
3) can I force them to compensate me for the time this money has been out of the market
4) can I do this without a lawyer, I’ve already reported them to the BBB

5)are there any other resources I can lean on for this?

If it helps at all from a legal perspective I live in NY State

stocks,Fed’s Bostic thinks recession can be avoided even with further interest-rate hikes,"The Federal Reserve can keep raising its benchmark rate this year at the fastest pace in nearly 30 years without causing a recession, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Monday.cIn a roundtable with reporters, Bostic noted the labor market added 372,000 jobs in June.c“What that tells me is there is enough momentum in the economy and enough ability for us to see a slowdown where we still wind up with positive job creation,” Bostic said. “That doesn’t feel like a recession,” he added.

Since March, the Fed’s benchmark policy rate has increased by 150 basis points from the emergency-low level close to zero put in place when the pandemic started. Bostic said he supports raising it another 150 basis points this year, including another ultra-large, 75-basis-point hike at the next FOMC meeting in two weeks. That would be the fastest pace of interest-rate hikes since 1994 into early 1995. 

Bostic said even with the moves to date, the Fed’s benchmark rate — in the range of 1.5% to 1.75% — is still boosting growth. This is not applying “hard brakes” to the economy, he said. Bostic said he has been encouraged with signs that the Fed’s moves have already started to slow the economy “in a fairly orderly way.” “There haven’t been dramatic jumps that suggest we’re on the cusp of something pretty significant,” Bostic said. So the Fed can keep moving rates up to a 3% rate, which Bostic said is “neutral,” neither boosting or slowing growth. At that point, if the inflation numbers don’t improve, Bostic said he would be comfortable moving interest rates higher into “restrictive” territory, meaning that would put the brakes on growth.

***Asked if he might ever support a full percentage-point rate hike — a popular discussion on Wall Street — Bostic didn’t rule it out.***

Becoming more aggressive would be an option, Bostic said, if the data comes in “a lot worse than what we expected” — for instance if inflation moved higher or there was evidence that longer-run inflation expectations started to move up. “I’m not expecting we’ll have to do” such a large move, he added.

Earlier Monday, Kansas City Fed President Esther George suggested the pace of rate hikes might be too aggressive. There has been a “growing discussion of recession risk, and some forecasts are predicting interest-rate cuts as soon as next year,” George said in a speech to the Mid-America Labor/Management Conference. “Such projections suggest to me that a rapid pace of rate increases brings about the risk of tightening policy more quickly than the economy and markets can adjust,” she said.

personalfinance,Need Advice About Student Loan Repayment,"Hi, I just needed some advice on whether or not I should pay back my student loans. For some background info, I'm 19 years old and took one semester of college, hated it, and dropped out. Now I am doing a program/bootcamp type thing to get my foot in the door of the computer science field (which is what I majored in in college). Thanks to that massive waste of time of a semester, I have a $2,750 federal loan. I do have enough to pay it back; I estimate the program to take me about a month or two longer but obviously it'll take at least a few months to actually find a job.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I have enough to pay it back because I have a little nest egg from working. I don't pay rent, but I do pay for my own food which I am doing very cheap by making bulk food for the week (pasta :)). Obviously, I'd much rather not spend that much money at once because I have no income, but I technically can. If I don't, the monthly bill will be $50 but then I'd have it looming over my head which makes me uncomfortable. Another major concern is my credit score. My score is 730 and I have two credit cards. Since I'm so young, my credit history is low so paying it off would drop it, but I feel that in the long run it might be better to rip the band aid off. Also, I have no debt with my credit cards keeping my utilization low, paying it off on time, and not applying to too many cards.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for that giant paragraph but, what would you do if you were me? Rip the band aid off and pay it, don't pay it and have the monthly bill, or just fake your death so you never have to worry about it again? Thanks in advance!",finance,1657611278

personalfinance,Mortgage rate lock - Lender is not happy about it,"I'm purchasing my first house. Still looking for houses in the market. I got pre- qualified by my lender and currently going through the pre underwriting process.

Because of the rising interest rates, I asked my lender about locking the interest rates. He was not thrilled about it. He told me that they have a interest rate lock program that will lock the rates for 70 days. If I opt in to that program then I have to find a house within 40 days and close it within another 30 days. 

He mentioned multiple times that he is not recommend it due to the low inventory. Anyway to get all these information, I had to send him 5-6 emails because I felt that he was not willing to give all the info about it. In his every response he mentioned that he dont recommend it. 

I know that there is a option called float down also available incase if the rates goes down, then you can get that rate even your rates are locked. But he was not willing to give me those info easily.

My question is:

Is it normal for home buyers to get the rates lock or Am I asking him something I should not ask?

In other word, Is it fair to ask for a rate lock?",finance,1657615575

cardano,How is Lending Pond different from a regular NFT marketplace?,"I just learned about [Lending Pond](https://lendingpond.app/) \- apparently the app allows users to take ADA loans in exchange for posting an NFT as collateral. The NFT they post must be worth a certain percentage more than the ADA they are requesting, thereby ""overcollateralizing"" the loan. Borrowers set their own interest rates and degree of overcollateralization, and lenders can review theses offers and choose to finance whatever deals they feel are acceptable. 

It all seems to be a great idea, accept when you look at how much ADA is being requested for some of these NFTs, the whole system seems to fall apart. Even with the market as crashed as it is, people are still requesting hundreds of dollars for jpgs. It seems very obvious to me that no one on the platform ever intends to pay back their loans, and is simply posting their NFT as ""collateral"" with the idea that they will just walk away with the loan money and never pay back the loan to get their NFT back. The lender then makes no interest on the ADA they ""loaned"" out, but instead is just stuck with a worthless jpg. 

I think a way to fix this would be to post the actual current value of the NFT that is being used as collateral, so it would be easy to see the amount of ADA that could be taken as profit should the borrower fail to pay back the loan.

economy,From cracks to split?,"Russia has stopped pumping natural gas through Nord Stream-1, announcing that routine maintenance was being carried out on the pipeline. The truth is that, earlier they did not exceed 3-4 days, but this time they would last 10 days. The German government reasonably assumes that after this period the Russian Federation may not launch this gas pipeline. This way Moscow can achieve several results at once - sending a threatening message to Berlin, declaring its indispensability and artificially increasing gas prices. Most likely, this will be the case, and translated from diplomatic into ordinary language, this means that the Kremlin has declared a gas war against all of Europe.

Well, politicians from Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine have been convincing other European countries for decades that for Russia the hydrocarbon trade is not just a profitable business, but an insidious energy weapon. But in Brussels, they believed that the countries of Eastern Europe from the former communist camp were simply slandering Moscow as their recent enemy. Later, US politicians warned the Europeans of the urgent need to diversify energy supplies. But in Berlin and Paris there was no doubt that the Americans were only dreaming of pushing Russian hydrocarbons from the European market. Today, in the EU and other European countries, no one doubts that the Kremlin is perfectly able to use its energy supplies as an ""energy baton"" and a means of blackmail.

Starting the war against Ukraine on February 24, the Russian Federation reduced by 60% the volume of ""blue fuel"" transported through the Ukrainian gas transportation system. Then, on March 30 this year Russia completely stopped the flow of gas through Belarus, Poland and Germany through the Yamal-Europe pipeline.

The NS-1 gas pipeline began to be filled by Russia only by 40% of the design capacity, starting from mid-June of this year. This coincided with the visit of the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania to Kyiv, where they advocated granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership. July 11 this year The Russian Federation announced the planned maintenance of the NS-1 for 10 days. At the same time, Moscow declares that it will not be able to launch gas through the pipeline on July 21 this year, because Canada, within the framework of sanctions, blocked the return of repaired gas pumping units from Siemens Energy to the Portovaya compressor station near Vyborg (Leningrad region). Canadian and German experts are confident that the Russian Federation is quite capable of re-launching the NS-1 even without the mentioned turbine. Why is the Kremlin so focused on the issue of returning sanctioned equipment?

The Ukrainian side and even the Russian oppositionists (who are well aware of V. Putin's methods) are sure that Russia is trying to create an important and public precedent for lifting sanctions, which it will then try to use to get more and more exceptions from the list of restrictions!

Thus, recently Moscow began to demand from the European Commission and Vilnius that they immediately allow the transportation to the Kaliningrad region (in transit through Lithuania) of all sanctioned goods, including dual purpose. Also, the EU already has a precedent for excluding (even if only temporarily) Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia from the embargo imposed by the European Union on Russian oil. It is quite clear that the more exclusions the restrictive measures introduced by Western countries and their allies have, the more room for various maneuvers the

Kremlin will have.

In addition, a selective approach to the observance of sanctions will certainly disrupt the consolidation of the states that are part of the anti-war coalition. For example, in Berlin they could not resist Moscow's threats related to transit to Kaliningrad, and began negotiations both with the European Commission and with Vilnius. Thus, with its skillful blackmail, the Russian Federation is trying to weaken the solidarity of the states of the anti-Putin coalition. Therefore, the main desire of Russia in the situation with the shutdown of NS-1 is not the desire to get a high-tech turbine. The main goal of the

Kremlin is to split the unity of the West and its allies!",finance,1657625689

# [Stock futures fall as growth concerns linger, dollar surges](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/11/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as worries over global economic growth dented investor appetite for risk assets. Wall Street also looked ahead to the start of what could be a difficult earnings season.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped by 221 points, or 0.71%. S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.43% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.07%.
*****
&gt; Investors appeared to be shunning riskier assets such as stocks in favor of traditional safe havens such as U.S. Treasurys and the dollar. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 7 basis points to 2.92%.
*****
&gt; The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency’s performance against six other currencies, popped 0.5% to 108.51. That gain put the euro on the brink of parity with the dollar, as recession fears grow in Europe.
*****
&gt; The dollar index has been on fire this year, rising 13% in that time. Several Wall Street strategists have warned that this strength in the U.S. currency could spell trouble for corporate earnings ahead.
*****
&gt; “The surging USD is a symptom of global unease and will make life even more difficult for Corporate America (the EPS headwind from FX is going to be enormous) and int’l central banks (as the slumping EUR, GBP, etc., adds to the inflationary pressures in the EU and UK),” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; PepsiCo kicked off the corporate earnings season Tuesday morning, with the snacks and beverages giant reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. The company also raised its revenue outlook for the year. Delta Air Lines and JPMorgan Chase are among the companies slated to report later this week.
*****
&gt; Market participants will watch for downside risk to earnings forecasts as companies grapple with rising interest rates and greater inflationary pressures, and as Wall Street debates the likelihood of a recession.
*****
&gt; “In terms of S&amp;P earnings, for instance, we think we’re already moving towards an earnings recession,” Marathon Asset Management’s Bruce Richards said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “Companies are getting squeezed at all sides, they’re getting squeezed on cost of goods and the wages and all things that go into input from our manufacturing goals or services. And on the other end, we think revenues are starting to flatten before turning down at a time when interest cost is going up. ...That’s a lot of downgrades, a lot of potential defaults coming from the system as a result of higher charges.”
*****
&gt; Inflation is also on investors’ radars this week with June’s consumer price index report set for release Wednesday. The headline inflation number, including food and energy, is expected to rise to 8.8% from May’s level of 8.6%, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was coming off a downbeat session in which the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all fell.

personalfinance,Taxes with Backdoor Roth,"I have funds in a tIRA that were recharacterized from my Roth after exceeding income limits (2020).  My plan was to convert back to Roth, but didn't follow through.  Well, now the market is down and gains on the $6k are minimal, so thought it would be a good time to convert.  TD Ameritrade's online transfer option is making me second guess my tax obligations and I need a sanity check.

* 2020 Roth contribution - $6,000
   * Recharacterized to tIRA w/ gains ($6k shown on Form 8606 Part I for 2020 taxes)
* 2022 Backdoor Roth
   * Current account $6,800
   * Fill out 8606 Part II and show $6800 converted, $6000 basis, taxable on $800
   * Ideally, I'd like to add another $6k to the tIRA and convert it all at once.  This would require Part I for 2022 taxes, and then show $12k as my basis on Part II, correct?

What is tripping me up is the ""Federal Withholding"" option on Ameritrade.  I don't intend to do this, I will pay at tax time, but I clicked it to see what would be taken and they assume all of it is taxable.  Do I need to request an accurate gain statement from them?

Recently came into $12k and the way I see it, there are two viable options.

1. Pay one lump sum on the $200k balance on my home which has a 3.5% interest rate on the mortgage.
   1. I still have PMI on this and wasn't able to get it off in the refi, and i'm paying about $158.00 per month (I know, i'm a miserable failure in terms of reading contracts, be gentle)
2. Pay one lump sum on the wife's student loans (federal) $60k balance at 6% (presently 0 due to deferment).
   1. Caveat: There's news that POTUS may legislate $10k in forgiveness to these loans, but who knows.

My gut is telling me to put it on my home, as the balance is higher. But the student loans aren't presently in an unmanageable place. I'm not undergoing any financial struggles presently, but want to be in the best position to pay off all this debt asap.

stocks,"The Dollar is becoming stronger by the day, what does this mean globally?","https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy

We haven’t seen the dollar this strong since the early 2000’s which begs the question, what does this mean for the global economy? 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002932

The dollar is the most common currency of choice for debt contracts worldwide. According to the Bank for International Settlements. 

https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/emerging-markets-drive-global-debt-record-303-trillion-iif-2022-02-23/

Global debt has hit a record high of over $300 trillion dollars. 

https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294

Commodity trades among countries are mostly settled in dollars. Things like agriculture, energy, and metals.

Opinion: 

Now that I’ve given you the facts I’d like to share my thoughts. 

The global economy will suffer as a result of the dollar becoming stronger. Countries/ Corporations that owe a significant amount of debt will find it harder and harder to pay off that debt with interest rates going up and the dollar becoming stronger. This will lead to Countries/Corporations defaulting on their debt, Sri Lanka was only the first domino to fall. 

This gets worse, as countries start to have a hard time accessing liquidity and paying off their debt they’ll also be faced with a shortage of commodities. Their domestic currency will start to devalue vs the dollar making commodities extremely expensive relative to their domestic currency.   

I expect the Middle East/Africa to be the most impacted, considering the amount of food they import. 

You may think the United States is safe from this global mess, but mind you we import most of our stuff so it’ll be interesting to see how things play out.

personalfinance,Maxing 401k vs Saving for house down payment,"Hi guys, I know this topic has been beaten to death but just want some outside perspective on my situation specifically. I’m 25 and just became eligible for my employer 401k. They give 3% automatically and then match 1/4 of my contributions with no limit all the way to the $20,500 federal limit. 

With an income of 75k it would take me about 27% pretax. I don’t think I could afford to that but could do 20% if I wanted to pour all my disposal income into it. However, I’m wanting to buy a house in maybe 3-4 years. 

I’m struggling with the idea of contributing less and not getting that free money in the match but getting close to maxing out the 401k would delay my ability to purchase a home in that timeline. What do you think is the smarter move? See below for other financial stats.

personalfinance,Seeing the End of the Tunnel,"Below are the personal details I will share, I see how many people flame others in here. I dont need a lecture, I have made stupid decisions, and I know that. I am working hard to correct them. I still make a few here and there, I acknowledge them and that is that. 

I grew up in a single parent household, under someone who didn't make great financial decisions, and essentially paid for everything for myself from the age of 13 (thankful for how i was raised and always having a roof over my head, as well as growing up in a great/safe neighborhood). I went to an extremely expensive private university, which I never should have done. While there I worked 4-5 part time jobs at a time to make ends meet. After graduating, I made my next dumb decision, living without roommates with a low paying job in high COL area. 

  
Started to rack up massive CC debt, pay day loans, you name it. Got a higher paying job, and moved to an even higher COL area. On top of that, did not manage my finances well (bigger pay checks bought nicer things, and drinks for anyone and everyone at the bar, lots of dating), had to eat a lot of costs to pay to play in my job etc etc. 

  
Well, finally, I paid off 20k of revolving credit card debt, 6k to go. Took a new job, salary is less, forced me to budget better, and am actually saving more, and not paying for work expenses out of pocket anymore. I probably make more per hour than I did at the higher paying role all things considered. I did something many of you will flame me for: took my 10k 401k to put to my largest CC debt, and saved 2k for emergencies (savings is growing bi monthly, and 401k contributions will be made starting next month). 

I made another screw up, and bought a car above my means. I am still currently still hitting my budget. My current job, i get a 5k commission check everytime I close a deal. New to the job so still havent turned anything as it is a long sales cycle, BUT I want to know what exactly what to do when I get a commission check:  


Student loan- $48k avg interest rate 4.76% $412 monthly payment

Car Note- $51,065 interest rate 3.74% $715 monthly payment 

CC Debt $6,100 0% interest until 10/23..I pay about 500 month, sometimes 1k  

Only thing I will say about the car, I know I probably never should have bought a car that expensive with this much debt. But it was my dream car, and I have been watching prices on them for years. When I came across the one I bought, it was significantly marked down, and I never thought I would get the deal that I got again, despite what is going on in the current market of used cars. It also suits my needs better than the sedan I had, as I have 3 dogs and a girlfriend and we take cheap weekend trips and usually drive and needed more space. 

  
Back to my question: I anticipate bringing in 50k in commission 2023-2024. Do I hammer away at the car since the monthly payment is larger, and then snowball the car payment into the student loan? Do i do the opposite, pay the student loan, and then snowball that into the car? OR do i alternate commission checks to each one? I anticipate paying off the card by March '23 at the latest, on current pace.

- Both of our jobs are stable, even with the pandemic. We both have potential for upward mobility. 
- I can pick up more hours at my side hustle if needed. Side hustle is related to my hobby and I like it more than my main job.

stocks,There are 3 major signs inflation may have peaked — but they don't mean things are going to get cheaper right away By Ben Winck,"* Several signs suggest inflation has peaked, and will continue gradually cooling from the pace seen earlier in 2022.
* The trend, known as disinflation, means prices will still broadly rise, just at a slower pace.
* While some costs are set to drop, a prolonged decline would hint at an entirely new problem.

The US could very well be past the worst of its inflation problem. But don't expect things to get cheaper.  


For much of the past two years, the pace of price increases has been accelerating. Headline inflation now sits at an [**8.6% year-over-year pace**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9pbmZsYXRpb24tcmVwb3J0LWNwaS1tYXktZ2FzLXByaWNlcy1mZWRlcmFsLXJlc2VydmUtcmF0ZS1oaWtlcy0yMDIyLTY_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBab6202f6/email), marking the fastest rate since 1981.  


Yet recent data suggests that surge [**could be turning over**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9pbmZsYXRpb24tb3V0bG9vay1wY2UtbWF5LXBlYWtlZC1nYXMtcHJpY2VzLWZvb2QtbGlmdGluZy1jb3N0cy0yMDIyLTY_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBf958e16c/email). Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has decelerated for three straight months, according to the [**Personal Consumption Expenditures**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVhLmdvdi9uZXdzLzIwMjIvcGVyc29uYWwtaW5jb21lLWFuZC1vdXRsYXlzLWFwcmlsLTIwMjI_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBaf05e519/email) price index. Month-over-month price growth is also down from the levels seen early in the year.  


📷  


But even though inflation looks like it might be cooling off, don't expect things to get much cheaper.  


To understand the path of inflation, one has to wrap their head around a key distinction. Inflation tracks the pace at which prices grow, not actual price levels. The cooldown seen over the past few months means that prices are still climbing, just at a slower pace.  


The current decline is a perfect example of disinflation. The term describes inflation that's still positive but weaker than before, and it's exactly what the [**Federal Reserve**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlL3doYXQtaXMtdGhlLWZlZGVyYWwtcmVzZXJ2ZT91dG1fY29udGVudD1JbnNpZGVyX0ZlYXR1cmVkX0FydGljbGU/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBdcfbccea/email) and the Biden administration want to see.  


Contrary to what many Americans probably believe, some inflation is good. It symbolizes a healthy amount of consumer demand and, more broadly, sustainable economic growth. The Fed has long targeted a one-year inflation rate of about 2%. That level is, according to the central bank, the best for balancing maximum employment and price stability. Allowing for higher inflation would conflict with the Fed's price-stability goal, and a lower target would likely foster a less inclusive labor market.  


Many Americans likely want to see prices drop for some time after the past year's price surge. Yet a prolonged period of falling prices would make for an entirely different crisis. Such a trend, also known as deflation, can kickstart a vicious cycle for the entire economy.  


Businesses tend to slow production when prices fall in order to protect their margins. That usually leads to layoffs and weaker pay growth. If the trend lasts long enough, widespread joblessness can lower demand and pull prices lower still. Deflation is a surefire sign of a weak economy and can quickly pull a country into a downturn similar to the Great [**Depression**](https://link.insider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZ3VpZGVzL2hlYWx0aC9tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoL3doYXQtaXMtZGVwcmVzc2lvbj91dG1fY29udGVudD1JbnNpZGVyX0ZlYXR1cmVkX0FydGljbGU/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB6db5e4b7/email).  


For now, it looks like the economy is experiencing disinflation, not deflation. Some prices have fallen in recent weeks, but a brief decline among a limited set of goods and services isn't enough to sound the deflation alarms.  


Here are three reasons why that trend of disinflation is likely to continue for the rest of 2022.  


**(1) The biggest inflation drivers are weakening**  


Much of the latest inflation surge comes down to commodity prices, specifically food and energy commodities. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions on the Kremlin [**slammed the global supply of several key goods**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS1pbmZsYXRpb24tbGlmdGluZy1wcmljZXMtYW1lcmljYW4tc2hvcHBlcnMtZ2FzLXdoZWF0LW5pY2tlbC0yMDIyLTM_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB355b72f7/email) including crude oil, wheat, natural gas, fertilizer, and nickel. That drove prices sharply higher throughout the first months of 2022 and exacerbated inflation that was already running at multi-decade highs.  


That trend has reversed course in recent weeks. The S&amp;P GSCI — a popular benchmark for global commodity prices — is down nearly 23% from the record high posted in early June.

The declines are already offering Americans some relief. The average price of a gallon of gasoline slid to $4.78 on Wednesday, according to [**AAA**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9nYXNwcmljZXMuYWFhLmNvbS8_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB78fb6e6f/email), down from the mid-June record of just over $5. About 80% of gas stations are back to selling regular-grade fuel for less than $5 a gallon, Andrew Gross, a AAA spokesperson, said in a Tuesday [**release**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9nYXNwcmljZXMuYWFhLmNvbS93aWxsLWdhcy1kZW1hbmQta2VlcC1mYWxsaW5nLW9yLWlzLXRoZXJlLWEtdS10dXJuLWFoZWFkLz91dG1fY29udGVudD1JbnNpZGVyX0ZlYXR1cmVkX0FydGljbGU/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB35daa625/email).  


**(2) Supply chains are healing**  


The supply chain snags that emerged in 2021 played a major role in pushing inflation to historic highs. Solving the tangle of port backlogs and shipping delays could cool price growth, and some indicators signal the situation is improving.  


For one, shipping rates are almost half of what they were at the height of the logistics mess in the fall. [**The Freightos Baltic Index**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYnguZnJlaWdodG9zLmNvbS8_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB36b5fd5d/email), which calculates the average price of shipping a 40-foot container of goods, fell to $6,577 in the week that ended July 1. That's down from $11,109 in September, and the decline has accelerated in recent months. The downtrend suggests kinks in the supply chain are being worked out, and as shipping costs fall, there will be less pressure on companies to boost prices.  


**(3) Companies are moving from price hikes to discounts**  


Easing inflationary pressures are an encouraging sign, but it takes time for that to translate to slower price growth at gas stations, grocery stores, and retailers. Commentary from several companies hints that shift is taking place right now.  


In a first-quarter earnings call on June 29, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond CFO Gustavo Arnal indicated the company will ""work aggressively"" to clear excess inventory that the company has built up, according to a transcript created by [**Sentieo**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWFwcC5zZW50aWVvLmNvbS8_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aB20c530da/email). The clearance will all but certainly come with many price cuts as the company looks to trim its stock.  


Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is far from the only company pivoting from inventory build-up to huge sales. Walmart executive John Furner told investors in June that it could take ""maybe a couple of quarters"" to clear out unwanted inventory. Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette told [**The Wall Street Journal**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/click/28342019.70663/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tYWN5cy1nYXAtYW5kLW90aGVyLWNsb3RoaW5nLXN0b3Jlcy1hcmUtc3R1Y2std2l0aC10aGUtd3JvbmctaXRlbXMtMTE2NTQ0MjE0MDE_bW9kPVNlYXJjaHJlc3VsdHNfcG9zOCZBSUQ9MTE1NTcwOTMmUElEPTY0MTU3OTcmU0lEPWJpJTdDNjJjNDhiYTAyNGUwMmExNzdjNGVmY2JjJTdDMTY1NzU3MzQ4MzkxMm4yeW0yaHlwJnN1YmlkPUJ1c2luZXNzJTIwSW5zaWRlciZjamV2ZW50PTI5ZDQ0MjUwMDE1ZDExZWQ4MjU1MDI2MzBhODJiODIwJnRpZXJfMT1hZmZpbGlhdGUmdGllcl8yPW1vYSZ0aWVyXzM9QnVzaW5lc3MlMjBJbnNpZGVyJnRpZXJfND0zODYxOTMwJnRpZXJfNT1odHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL21hY3lzLWdhcC1hbmQtb3RoZXItY2xvdGhpbmctc3RvcmVzLWFyZS1zdHVjay13aXRoLXRoZS13cm9uZy1pdGVtcy0xMTY1NDQyMTQwMT9tb2QlM0RTZWFyY2hyZXN1bHRzX3BvczgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9SW5zaWRlcl9GZWF0dXJlZF9BcnRpY2xl/6133cf5f05904001183b913aBbc574bd8/email) in late May that inventory boomed faster than expected, and that markdowns will weigh on profits as the department store chain clears some supply.

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Free Fall followed by Market Reports, Forecasts and Analysis. What should you know? Is it something the world neglects to understand.","The world keeps talking about the ongoing “crypto crash”. Most cryptocurrencies are on free fall, while I am writing this article, the mighty Bitcoin itself in exchanges wiped out significant gains from it’s value and now fighting to hold its level at $20000. As usual, we will come across expert articles on “how this happened?”, “why it is happening?” and some might even boast “I warned about it before”. Some technical analysts will come online with a chart, lines and mathematical terms to brag about “what can we expect?”. All with a tiny, underlined note stating, “Subject to Market Risk, do your own assessment before investing”.

Means, it is “you” who decide what to do with your money and you must face all the risks involved to reach the “huge profit” figures showcased in the expert articles, investment recommendations or technical analysis, that was delivered to you before making the investment. Here, I am not against any services that offer investment directions to their users or viewers. There are numerous wonderful investment guiding services out there, who takes their job seriously and make all the efforts to point out safe place or asset to invest. And the warnings tagged are the industry standard, without which the authorities might come after them.

**I am not mentioning or pointing at anyone out there, but to understand the economical flow, let us assume the visualizations I am speaking about below, happens somewhere in Mars or Jupiter.**

Today, there are those fancy people or a group or an institution who with their vast resources and hefty wallets, gain access to world-class expert advice and custom-made technical indicators. Those are the makers of the “globalized profit focused” world, though with a very less headcounts they do hold a significant share in all vaults across the globe. Some idea pops up somewhere, a tiny set of like-minded community adopts it, the community grows when more people attach their wallets to it, suddenly, some luxurious supercomputer beeps somewhere, the fancy people get onboard, And the community’s vault bulges. Sounds good right? The story doesn’t end here like in fairy tales.

The people who where there to kick start the community with their tiny wallet can no longer afford to increase their holdings and only very few of them could hold what they have but most of them considering their commitments exit the community with some profits. Now the fancy people become the very foundation of the community which was once held by like-minded people who loved it for “**what it was**” and in fact “**not knowing where it would go**”. With fancy people onboard, the community upgrades colorfully, it gets very attractive for aspiring people with medium wallet to bet upon. Now who are these aspiring people? They are those people who got a visiting card, an office to work and most importantly an appealing number displayed on their credit score.

These aspiring people are mostly locked in a phase where their financial commitments make them do what they do. They long for an economic independence but still have the fear of losing their social status. This is where the aspiring people turn towards investments, however they will not have enough guts to join a budding community, nor will they have access to top notch investment deal like the ones enjoyed by the fancy people. Then what do they have really? They have the desire to setup a passive income, access to the strategic tools that got away during the R&amp;Ds done to deploy a beeping supercomputer for the fancy people or in some cases tools that are the part of vast exit scheme made for some group of fancy people. Is that all? No, most importantly they have access to loans. Personal, mortgage, credit line or even with promissory notes, they have access to loans. And they take it. One thing they never knew is these loans are from institutions or groups that are backed by fancy people’s “**Nest Eggs**”.

Now what do we have? A community with dropped off initial patrons, foundation taken over by fancy people and decorated by aspiring people with some savings along with loans acquired indirectly from the same or a different set of fancy people. All goes well, the fancy people enjoy the community’s growth along with the interests their nest eggs are making and some profits for the aspiring people in their portfolio. The growth looks stable, the EMIs are on time, and everything looks in order until the supercomputer beeps again. The fancy people get new community to tamper with, and then comes the “Shift” that quakes the existing community. With the foundation slipping away for better opportunities, the “Sell” begins. Some are lucky enough to decide for themselves on their staying or quitting stand, the rest starts panicking. Not to blame them, since they will have their EMI coming. They sell their holding in haste, just to know that with all the interest paid and balance, they are where they started or at times somewhere below.

And finally, where does all these leave us? A free fall community backed by some aspiring people who bought what they hold with their own money and some like-minded people who were holding it right from the beginning. That is the support line you see on charts and that is where the community starts growing again. On every free fall, one can easily find how many fancy, aspiring and like-minded people a community has. And in fact, out of the circulating anger and frustrated posts about the community, one can easily find “**how many aspiring people got into it by borrowing**”.

What computer or tools can forecast a mighty president’s announcements? Be it a war or a interest cut, unlike fancy people who have access to influence or resources to know it before, a common man though in majority is always a minority when it comes to “**Staying Well Informed, with investment and money markets**”. They join hands to build something wonderful, just out of their love and passion, give it away for profits which are tiny on the bigger picture, invest just to make someone even richer and finally stand alone shouting and crying with loan burden on their back. Now, this is when the aspiring people alter their routine, they work hard to keep their jobs, they cancel their vacations, control their spending until their aspiration gets triggered with some trending market data news and analysis. The aspiration goes on.

*The community I am referring here can be anything. A talent, a business, a concept, a stock, a crypto asset or even a country, if you can look deeply into it, understanding the economical flow of any community is as simple as rocket science.*

Hopefully, now you understand how the hike in loan interest rate and announcement of increased interest rates on bonds in a world with energy crisis, ongoing war and pandemic inflation put a hole in your wallet as well. And no charts or market reports told you about it with conviction. Here is where they leave you with the original string attached, which is none other than “**Subject to market risk, do your own assessment before investing**”.

Finally, cryptos were originally made with common people in mind, with its decentralized nature it does have the immunity to stay strong. But with all those charts and analysis attached to it along with having it projected like some solid asset among people makes me wonder “*how many of us are going to financially survive this game?*”. Will the crypto industry end up as the biggest scam of the century? Will the time in which you spent 50000 Bitcoins for one pizza ever return?

No. it is not going to happen ever. The like-minded community have not fully left when it comes to crypto. They hold strong and steer through any market scenario, for it is all about the joy they get in holding something that they really own. Sell-offs and all red scenarios happens out of panic when a large group shift their interest, but the foundation stays strong. Again, I am not referring to all cryptos here, it is only the real crypto built with decentralization in mind will sustain.

If you are an aspiring crypto investor, spend some time in understanding how things works with cryptos. After all, cryptocurrencies are just a payment method with no national boundaries, it is truly for the people by the people. It is not against any authorities; it is just an aspiration towards unbiased availability. It is not something to hold in private, keep it if your country permits, pay taxes if asked, stick to the community and stay prosperous. 

**Let us make the world better, let us make decentralised economy a possibility for anyone and everyone.**",cryptocurrency,1657656844
CryptoCurrency,Bear Market Books (A list of educational resources to get you through the bear market),"# Introduction

Things are fairly depressing at the moment, and even if you aren't worried, bear markets are fairly boring. I know I am not doing much apart from my weekly DCA into Bitcoin. Therefore, I have compiled a list of educational resources that I aim to to make my way through over the bear market. This is mainly for myself but I thought others might be interested so I am going to share here.

Below you will find a list of books, blogs, podcasts and courses that are widely recommended in the bitcoin/cryptocurrencies space. If I've read or consumed some of this content and I give some opinion on those but for the others listed here I will just give a small blurb on each.

Just to so you are aware, this list is fairly Bitcoin maxi, I wouldn't say I am 100% a maxi I still hold some ETH, and I will trade alts when the bull market returns, but a lot of that will be with the intention of gaining more Bitcoin. Also because Bitcoin is the first and and most well established cryptocurrency  out there it means there is far more educational material relating to it than any other cryptocurrency.

# Whitepapers:

You really should read them.

* [The Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://www.lopp.net/pdf/bitcoin.pdf) by Satoshi Nakamoto (How many have actually read this? I would strongly advise everyone to read this at least once it is truly revolutionary)
* [The Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) by Vitalik Buterin  (You should probably read this too)
* Any other project you are interested in's whitepaper, there are far to many to list here, but I think everyone should have knowledge of the first two.

# Courses:

There are loads of absolutely fantastic free courses out there on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency, I would strongly advise everyone to pick up at least one over the bear market.

* [Saylor Academy](https://learn.saylor.org/) \- There are several courses relating to Bitcoin, and plenty of other brilliant topics on the Saylor academy. I was first tipped off to it by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owcdlr/free_education_masterlist_free_courses_and_books/) by [u/SolorMining](https://www.reddit.com/user/SolorMining/), I would advise you to have a look at been slowly making my way through the Bitcoin for developers course, and the Austrian economics course
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) \- The Khan Academy got me through my first two years of college, Khan teaces complex topics and makes them easy, the exact same thing is done for [Bitcoin](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it).
* [MOOC: Introduction to Digital Currencies](https://www.unic.ac.cy/blockchain/free-mooc/)— By Andreas Antonopoulos, I have not done this one yet, but it's supposed to be very good
* [Udemy - Introduction to Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-cryptocurrencies/)
* [Coursera - Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency#)
* [Ethereum - Learn](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) \- This one is Ethereum specific and is developed by the Ethereum foundation, haven't looked at it myself but if you are interested in Eth then this is a good place to start.
* There are also courses on [Binance Academy](https://academy.binance.com/en) and [Coinbase Learn](https://www.coinbase.com/learn) although I haven't done either or heard whether they are good or not

# Books:

The most traditional form of education on this list, personally I don't have much time to read but pretty much everything on this list has an audio book format, and I find that much easier to digest, while in the Gym or on the road.

* [The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Price-Tomorrow-Deflation-Abundant-Future/dp/B08724PG5X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1V68O46D54QWP&amp;keywords=-+The+Price+of+Tomorrow&amp;qid=1657656630&amp;sprefix=the+price+of+tomorrow%2Caps%2C42&amp;sr=8-1)—  by Jeff Booth -  this one I have read, and found very interesting while it us not directly related to Cryptocurrencies it elegantly puts forward why we may need a deflationary currency to be the world reserve.
* [The Sovereign individual](https://www.amazon.com/The-Sovereign-Individual-audiobook/dp/B07TWNP9NB/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3JUUSV8UMU0Z9&amp;keywords=-+The+Sovereign+individual&amp;qid=1657656687&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+sovereign+individual%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C371&amp;sr=1-1) —  William Rees-Mogg (yes of that Rees-Mogg family) - I've also read this one, again it is not specifically about Bitcoin, but many Bitcoiners rave about it. It's an interesting book and it predicted many of the developments that we see today in the world and I think the ""critical"" part of the book is very good, but I really don't like the authors or their politics and that is to put it mildly.
* [Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order](https://www.amazon.com/Changing-World-Order-Nations-Succeed/dp/1982160276) — by Ray Dalio - Again I have not read this yet but I watched the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8) and was enthralled, so I have bought the book. Again it's not specifically about Crypto, but I believe it is related.
* [Essays on Bitcoin](https://economics.nd.edu/assets/165129/alex_kroeger_essays_on_bitcoin.pdf)  — Compiled by John Gleeson - I have not read this yet but it's free, so it's on my list.
* [The Internet of Money](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Internet-Money-collection-Andreas-Antonopoulos/dp/1537000454) **(Volumes 1 &amp; 2)** — By Andreas Antonopoulos
* [Mastering Bitcoin: Programming The Open Blockchain](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook)  — By Andreas Antonopoulos
* [Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)  — By Andreas Antonopoulos
* [The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_1/130-8193889-7552231?pd_rd_w=a2pHT&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.7757a8b5-874e-4a67-9d85-54ed32f01737&amp;pf_rd_p=7757a8b5-874e-4a67-9d85-54ed32f01737&amp;pf_rd_r=AJNG2ED21AJSW6MPPW5F&amp;pd_rd_wg=nEVQZ&amp;pd_rd_r=a923f317-777b-4540-af38-d2b9894016c8&amp;pd_rd_i=1119473861&amp;psc=1) —  by Saifedean Ammous
* [The Cryptopians](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1541763017?linkCode=gs4&amp;tag=crypto-books-wordpress-uk-2-21) —  by Laura Shin - This one is brand new but looks very interesting, it covers the history of Ethereum and the 2017 ICO craze. Defiantly on the list.

# Podcasts:

Like Youtube videos below, these probably aren't the very best source of information, however, I love Podcasts and I do rate these a little higher on the education scale than the majority of Youtube channels. The problem is there are just so different topics I end up missing out on a few and not keeping up them them constantly, here are a couple Cryptocurrency related Podcasts I listen to semi-regularly.

* [What Bitcoin Did](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/) \- For Bitcoin this the pick of the lot.
* [Bankless](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/)  \- Very Eth centric but decent for a different opinion to WBD
* [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) \- Not Crypto Specific but Lex get's a lot of Crypto industry experts on
* [Unchained](https://unchainedpodcast.com/)\- Not listened but heard its a good allrounder
* [The Investor's Podcast Network](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/our-team/) \- This one is a general all round investing podcast but has some great stuff on Bitcoin

# Blogs:

* [Willy Woo](https://woobull.com/) \- Chart Overload!
* [Unenumerated](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/) \- This is a blog I have always meant to get around to reading but still haven't found the time, there is a huge amount here on the history of money.
* [Dan Held ](https://www.danheld.com/blog)\- Has some great practical Bitcoin advice.

# YouTube:

Don't treat Youtube or Youtubers as an education sources, and these defiantly fall under the guise of edutainment, although in my opinion there is some good information to be gained from each of these channels. Just don't go relying on them as your primary source of financial advice (Not a financial advisor and all that)

* [Benjamin Cowen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRvqjQPSeaWn-uEx-w0XOIg) \- The best of the lot IMO, I actually spend some of my spare time recreating some of his charts using Python.
* [Coin bureau](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoinBureau) \- Mainly entertainment.
* [Invest Answers](https://www.youtube.com/c/InvestAnswers) \- Okay, shilled Luna a little though, so black mark for that.
* [Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/c/principlesbyraydalio) \- Okay not Crypto but man there is some great educational content here.
* [Glassnode](https://www.youtube.com/c/glassnode)\- Personally I am trying to learn a little more about OnChain Analysis and this is great channel for figuring that out.

# Other Resources:

I've included a few twitter accounts here but if you are getting educated off twitter then there really isn't much hope for the world, however, there are a couple of people I didn't know where to include but I find hugely insightful, so I decided to link there twitter accounts. There are also other miscellaneous resources I have found that I have included here

* [Lyn Alden](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) \- When Lyn talks I listen! She has a free [newsletter](https://www.lynalden.com/) but I mainly just keep up with her appearance on podcast.
* [Will Clemnte](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) \- More charts, Will also has an excellent free [newsletter](https://www.blockwaresolutions.com/intelligence-newsletter).
* [Plan B](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) \- He's a little (a lottle) sus, but his technical content still has value IMO.
* [Jamson Lopp](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html) \- Huge repository of Bitcoin knowledge.

# TLDR:

A list of all the resources I have compiled over the past year to educate myself on this crazy space were in. Feel free to save this post and forget to come back to it.

# Conclusion

So that's all I have so far, I posted this in the hope that others would find it useful, but I also selfishly would love if you added your suggestions in the comments so I have even more resources. Happy learnings!",cryptocurrency,1657659448
personalfinance,Navigating costs of Medical Evacuation Flight from Vacation,"Hello,

My mother and stepfather were recently on vacation in Jamaica where my stepfather contracted Covid which put him on a ventilator. We managed to navigate the medical system to transport them back Miami via a private air ambulance service, but the costs were astronomical.  


I was able to put the transportation service onto my credit cards, but I have no idea what happens next. I believe early on in the pandemic there were some forms of financial relief due to Covid, but due to the overwhelming nature of everything I'm struggling to find potential government or non-profit help.   


I'll be trying to join my family in Miami soon to support them, but I want to know what types of questions I should ask the hospital, what can I do to prepare for dealing with insurance (can that air ambulance even be reimbursed potentially?), and just in general, how do you deal extreme unexpected spending on medical necessities?  


Should I contact my state/federal representatives? I there anything they might be able to do? Someone gave me that tip but I am really not sure what to say.  


Can anyone provide guidance or tips for what I should do now? Thanks in advanced",finance,1657659812
personalfinance,How to finance an addition to our home:,"My wife and I are looking to add a bed/bath to our 2:1 1400 SQFt home in California. The problem is that we only have around 90k of equity in the home, and our interest rate is incredibly low. This means that refinancing in order to get more equity is not currently in the cards, and neither is moving because our mortgage payments would skyrocket.

A little bit of background, I've been with my girlfriend for about 4 years now and we both are still living at home with our parents. She wanted to live at home until she paid off her student loans which she just did about 6 months ago and I'm so proud of her for that. Me, on the other hand I never had any student loans as I forfeited the college route. Together our income is probably in the neighborhood of $150K. She is salaried and makes about 47K/yr and I am in a commission based job where I haven't made less than $80K since I started but the last 2 years I have been well over the $100K mark. We don't have many expenses on our own other than our cars (she pays like $200/m) and I pay about $400/m for mine, insurance and phone bills. We both have very good home lives, with great families but lately I've been thinking a lot about taking the next step in the relationship and moving in together. There is a very nice, newly constructed complex nearby with a gym, and pool, and biking trails renting at about $1,700/mo but at utilities are included. The apartment in question is about 1200sq and is a 2bed, 2bath, while we wouldn't need all of the extra space in the same complex a 1bed, 1bath is running in the neighborhood of $1,500/mo so the extra money is justifiable for friends or family who are visiting. 

We haven't seriously put much thought into actually pulling the trigger yet, and by my calculations our monthly expenses would be OK. I don't know why I just have a sense of panic about the whole idea, whether it is just nerves, worries about financial commitment, I'm not sure. 

I don't have an interest in buying a house at the moment, for many reasons but the first being interest rates. (I work in a financial environment). I also would not buy a house with someone who is not my spouse as I've seen how that story ends from the outside looking in. 

Am I over thinking the whole idea? Am I under thinking the whole idea?",finance,1657661070
stocks,Hurricane Season - hottest the US/Caribbean has been in year - should make for a monster hurricane season - which stocks should one add/drop,"Enough of recession, the fed, oil  and doom and gloom. Let's talk something positive - Hurricanes!

One US annual event is hurricane season. This years massive heat has ocean temp. warmer than usual and hurricane power comes from hot water. Which stock should people be adding to their portfolios going into q 3/4 if you are projecting a historic Season. 

First thought would always be the Rona's, Home Depots etc etc. Avoid insurance companies with exposure etc. but are there any regional companies that may have an edge in the rebuilding phase that investors could be adding now ahead of the level 4/5's that we can reasonably expect this year!",finance,1657661472

personalfinance,Help with understanding 401k withdrawal,"I’m helping my immigrant father withdraw everything from his 401k (it’s not much). He’s 72, retired, and already receiving SS. 

I’m not the most financially literate, though I’d like to learn. But anyways, I’m a bit confused on the Tax Withholding Election form.. it would be nice if someone can “dumb down” the follow text for me. I also understand that the whole withdrawn amount is taxed 20%.

My father chose to Elect federal/state income tax withheld from his distribution payments. The withholding will be based on Marital Status (Married) and Allowances (2). There’s an option to withhold a specific amount for federal income tax or a flat dollar amount to be withheld for state income tax. Does anyone recommend to add a specific amount to be held?

I’m a bit confused &amp; nervous to be the one filling this one for my dad since I’m not well versed.. and neither is he. I’d appreciate any help in advance. Thank you!",finance,1657668867

My personal favorite is

# ""It's already priced In""

**The Federal Reserve is making an announcement!**

**Recession is killing the economy!**

&gt;It's priced in already

**Satoshi just announced that he's  giving away all his bitcoin!!**

oil,WTI threatening to break key $95 level,"The German ZEW was the latest metric to highlight falling economic sentiment as aggressive monetary policy tightening, and ongoing lockdowns in China, have fuelled fears of a potential global recession. 

US Crude closed nearly 8% lower on Tuesday, and increasingly weak outlook for demand resulted in a rejection around $105 this week as the former uptrend’s support appeared to act as a resistance. 

While WTI has made a series of lower highs since mid-June, it has so far managed to avoid a close below $95- a level that has acted strong support, as well as resistance, a number of times this year. Prices are continuing to hold this key level at the time of writing today, however, if data over the coming days/weeks continues to signal an economic slowdown, price could be at risk of breaking lower and sustaining a larger downtrend. 

All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see how this develops, especially with US inflation data due later today.",energy,1657686393

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. IOHK has released an article about why eUTxO (e.g. Cardano) is so much better than EVM (e.g. Ethereum) for predicting impermanent loss. Two big eUTxO advantages in this regard relate to concentrated liquidity and fee determinism.

12. Ethereum is still facing significant potential challenges with complexity overload, the full spectrum of MEV, Cartelization of the network due to liquid staking derivative platforms, attack surface related to slot leader schedule, the history of PoW validators actually being the same people hiding under multiple different pool names, and other forms of centralization. You can hear ETH devs discussing these issues here in this podcast put up a few days ago:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFwKyaQOE)
13. Specifically on the danger of cartelization of the network, it looks like Ethereum’s choice of slashing in their proof-of-stake model has created this ripple effect problem via derivatization of staked assets in platforms like Lido that creates this potential for cartelization of the network. Here an Ethereum foundation researcher details those risks. [https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240)

15. New York lawmakers just passed a bill to ban crypto mining related to carbon based sources. It’s been obvious this was coming for a while ever since the reports of mining operations dumping hot waste water into the finger lakes and affecting the ecology.

16. Reports are also coming in that the Biden Administration crypto plans due in August will target Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains over their “sky high” energy consumption. I think we all knew this would eventually come despite the wide spectrum of clever rationalizations regarding Bitcoin’s energy use by its maximalists.

personalfinance,(EU) Is it better to go for a variable or fixed mortgage in the current economy?,"I need to take out a mortgage for a small flat. I wanted to ask whether it would be better to go for the fixed or a variable one. The current fixed one I got an offer for was at around 2.5% fixed for 20 years, whereas the variable is closer to 0, around 0.3%. That will increase as the interest rates are upped, but I am wondering if it will reach and exceed the 2.5% offered in the fixed. It might also be possible for me to pay the mortgage within 5-10 years, which makes the fixed one even less appealing as I am capped in annual payments. 

I would really appreciate some advice as with us enterting a recession, I don't think interest rates should rise but on the other hand, to combat the inflation, they undoubtly will, which is making me confused as I am no expert in these matters. 

Thank you! :)",finance,1657699024

gaming,Warcraft 3: Worst game of all time?,"I'm wondering if anyone is old enough to remember Warcraft 2:  Tides of Darkness.  If you compare Warcraft 3 to Warcraft 2, you can see the start of an awful, awful trend in gaming.

Warcraft 2 was a gritty dark game, which focused on medieval warfare between fantasy races.  While there were magic and fantasy elements, they followed real world mechanics (rather than the real world following magic mechanics).  The focus was clearly on gritty medieval-style warfare.  ""Whimsical"" was not a word you would use to describe the game.  There were also great naval battle elements that added to the sense of warfare and helped create a believable universe.

Warcraft 3 was a travesty.  It brought in over the top cartoonish graphics that completely divorced it from any recognizable world.  Instead of staying gritty and realistic it became whimsical and disney-fied.  Bright lush colors, while visually stimulating, completely did away with the grim world they had created in Warcraft 2.  Simple combat animations began to have ""firework"" displays (hence combat in WoW), completely removing the feel of combat.  They even did away with naval combat, simplifying the gaming formula into a spoon-fed recipe.

In my mind Warcraft 3 was the first major example of the cartoon graphics that have come to dominate so many games.  I feel like a huge opportunity was lost and games would go in a direction that was less offensive, more family-friendly, and I suppose more marketable and profitable direction.

I can't help but feel it was a crossroads game that chose the wrong direction.  To this day it's watered-down atmosphere, Disney color palette, and sanitized gaming formula is followed by so many other games.",technology,1657704842

CryptoCurrency,Is repaying loans after closing withdrawal actually a good sign? Lets clear some misconceptions!,"After reading yet another post about ""Celsius repayed x amount of loan"" and seeing all the posts filled with unsubstantial hopium, I felt the need to clear some misconceptions around this topic:

# How are platforms like celsius working

They are a simple CeFi platform. They are borrowing crypto from their customers and lending it out to other customers. The funny part about that is that they are paying a higher interest rate for deposits than they are charging for loans. How does this work? Well they are investing and trading themself (very often with leverage).

# What happend?

In short crypto winter happend. Celsius was overinvested and they go caught with their pants down, when the market started to turn downwards fast. 

# What were the consequences?

1. They were/are at the risk of getting margin called for a lot of their positions
2. They did not have enough cash/crypto available to repay their loans and meet the withdrawal demands. --&gt; they had to close withdrawals (not doing that would have been worse for everyone involved longterm)
3. Their assets suddenly are worth less than the amount they are owning their customers (remember that one for later)

# But know everything is getting better because they are repaying their loans, isn't it?

Well yes and no... Yes it is better to reduce/get rid of the risk of margin calls, but repaying loans is a zero sum game for your balance sheet. Their assets are still worth less than what they are owing their customers.

Example:

You got $400 in cash and are owing your buddy $100. Your networth is $300. If you repay your buddy you are free of debt but only have $300 left. Your networth still is $300.

By the way: Repaying your DeFi/CeFi debt would also be the first step **before** declaring bankruptcy. Why? The assets securing your loan are (almost) always worth more than your loan. Defaulting on that loans would actually reduce your networth.

# What is coming next?

Well that is a tough one. There are not many likely scenarios that will save 100% of the customers assets but let's try it:

1. A miraculous investor appears. Yeah well that is self explanatory.
2. Crypto is recovering and their assets start to be worth more than their debt again. You can decide yourself how likely this is short term, while looking at the global economy.

That are actually all 100% recovery scenarios I can think of.

# What is most likely to happen?

Celsius will repay all their CeFi/DeFi debt and will declare bankruptcy. How much every user will get back depends on so many factors, that I am not willing to speculate.

I hate to be right on that one:

cardano,Cardano survives the bear market,"Cardano has already survived one bear market after 2017 and is still a relevant project in the top 10. We are currently in a bear market due to the poor economic situation and the post-halving period of Bitcoin. Let’s take a look at why Cardano will easily survive the current bear market as well.

### TLDR:

* Cardano has survived the bear market between 2017 and 2021. In the next bull market, Cardano will celebrate 10 years of existence. The Lyndy effect will be quite strong.
* Just as the bursting of the dot-com bubble had a cleansing effect on internet services, bear markets in the cryptocurrency space are filtering out promising projects from the rest.
* Market cycles do not affect the IOG team’s efforts and adoption of Cardano.
* Cardano is stronger in this bear market because you can build applications on it. Additionally, we are going to see many enhancements like Input Endorsers, Hydra launch, Lace wallet with integration to Atala PRISM (decentralized identity), Djed stablecoin, and more.
* Never try to judge a project’s future potential by its current market capitalization in an ongoing bear market.
* The IOG team will be constantly improving Cardano, so it will be very difficult for competitors to catch up with the development and deliver something significantly better.
* A blockchain project that fails to deliver utility is not sustainable in the long term and its relevance will fade with the interest in speculating on value growth.
* Banks are not worried about the monetary policy of individual blockchain projects, but the technology itself. A globally available network capable of transmitting P2P value and building services on top of it is a threat to them.
* The Internet has changed many industries, and it is to be expected that if the Internet changes with the advent of blockchain technology, it will also affect the companies that use the Internet.
* To be a relevant alternative to banking services, the blockchain industry must be able to replicate mainstream financial services. This means that they must be able to provide interest on user deposits.
* Blockchain networks of the future aren’t going to be defined by first to market or fastest to get network effect. They are always going to be defined by best under stress and most durable.

### A look into the past

The halving event of Bitcoin defines market cycles in the cryptocurrency world. The year following the year in which the halving event occurs, we can usually expect all relevant projects to reach ATH. New ATHs are usually reached at the end of the year. This is followed by a multi-year bear market. With Bitcoin halving approaching, the market capitalizations of projects will start to grow again. Four-year cycles are not very rational and can be expected to end once higher adoption is achieved.

The previous Bitcoin halving occurred in 2016. ADA coins get to the open market in 2017. It was the year when projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Cardano reached ATH in the given cycle. A bear market of several years followed between the years 2017 and 2021. The last halving took place in 2020 and as usual, the new ATHs of many projects were reached in 2021. We are now in a bear market. If everything continues as before, which can never be certain, the downturn may last until 2024/2025. 

The cryptocurrency market has begun to copy the stock market (especially S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq), so it is possible that if the financial crisis ends, four-year cycles will be broken. At the moment, nothing is certain. 

It is important to note that in addition to Bitcoin’s halving, the current market sentiment is influenced by the negative economic outlook across the globe. Inflation is rising in almost every country in the world and many are starting to face recession. All technology stocks are falling in value. Cryptocurrencies are perceived as technology, so it’s not surprising that the value of cryptocurrencies is falling as well.

After 2017, literally hundreds of projects disappeared. Only a few survived, including Cardano. Why did Cardano manage to survive?

Many fraudulent projects raised money in ICOs in 2017 and the team had no plans to build and deliver anything new. People used ICOs to enrich themselves. Many teams may have wanted to deliver their solutions but ran out of funding due to falling cryptocurrency values. Some projects were not completed or came to the market at the wrong time, so there was no interest in them. 

Sometimes people tend to see all projects the same and not see the differences. However, this is a big mistake. 99% of the projects may have been a scam from the start, but that doesn’t mean there can’t be a project that is different from the rest. A bear market naturally cleanses the market. If a project survives, it means it has done something worthwhile. Cardano survived the bear market. 

It is important to note that it is no coincidence that Cardano survived and the reasons are obvious. The IOG team had a sufficient budget to fund technology development and had a plan to deliver. The team defined a mission for the project that is clear and perceived as a benefit to society. The team communicated and reported transparently on the results of their work. Cardano Summits were held. The community was growing. The team worked successfully on adoption.

### The bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Lyndy effect

The ICO mania of 2017 and the subsequent demise of a large number of projects are reminiscent of the bursting of the dot-com bubble. The dot-com bubble is the name given to the period from 1996 to 2001 when Internet usage increased massively. During this period, internet companies boomed and then collapsed. The Nasdaq stock market index, under which many Internet companies were listed, peaked in 2000 before collapsing. The bubble burst. During this crash, many online shopping and communications companies failed and went out of business. For example, companies such as Pets-dot-com, Webvan and Boo-dot-com, Worldcom, and many others. While other companies saw their stock plummet and lost much of their market capitalization, they survived. These companies include Cisco and Qualcomm. Other companies, such as eBay and Amazon-dot-com, lost value but recovered quickly.

Bear markets can have a salutary effect by separating relevant projects from a large number of low-potential projects. If a project survives a bear market, it is evidence of the project’s viability and its chances of success increase dramatically.

The Lindy effect is a theorized phenomenon by which the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things, like a technology or an idea, is proportional to their current age. Thus, the Lindy effect proposes the longer a period something has survived to exist or be used in the present, it is also likely to have a longer remaining life expectancy. Longevity implies a resistance to change, obsolescence, or competition and greater odds of continued existence into the future. Where the Lindy effect applies, the mortality rate decreases with time.

Cardano gets stronger with every year of its existence and even stronger with every bear market it survives. Although Cardano has been building since 2014/2015, few people became aware of it in 2017. In a bear market, not many people are interested in cryptocurrencies. Even though the community grew in the bear market, it’s very likely that most took notice of Cardano sometime in 2020. The PoS deployment, the Africa Special event, or something else could have helped. We can conclude that for a large portion of supporters, Cardano is still a very young project.

### At what stage are we now

In the current bear market, it is even more obvious that Cardano is a relevant project. Cardano is still one of the most developed projects thanks to a huge team. Every month, fans can look at Cardano 360 and see the technological progress. Tens of thousands of people follow the updates on YouTube. A growing number of teams are registering their ideas in Catalyst and more people are voting each round. Adoption at the state and the corporate level continues successfully.

In a bear market, media interest in smaller projects and cryptocurrencies, in general, may wane. However, this does not mean that nothing is happening. Market cycles do not affect the IOG team's efforts and adoption of Cardano. The rising value of coins usually attracts the attention of speculators. However, Cardano as a platform does not need them as much as real users.

This bear market differs from the last one in that new apps can be built on Cardano. Third-party developers can build their solutions and deploy them. Hundreds of teams are working on something new. Catalyst will help fund new ideas and the community decides what projects to fund.

It is possible to issue tokens and NFTs. We have decentralized exchanges and it is possible to build new DeFi services. We will see an algorithmic stablecoin Djed. The first version of the second layer called Hydra will be deployed soon. The IOG team will ship a new lightweight wallet, Lace, which will offer the ability to create your own decentralized identity via Atala PRISM. Interesting side-chains are being developed. This is all happening in the ongoing bear market.

Never try to judge a project’s future potential by its current market capitalization in an ongoing bear market. It makes no sense. You have to accept the current global market sentiment and realize that even the best project has no chance of growing during a financial crisis. It is important to look ahead and think about what will happen after the crisis is over.

Cardano will still be here around 2024 and it will get stronger. In the next bull market, Cardano will celebrate 10 years of existence. By that time, Cardano will be scaling significantly better on the first layer, as this is now a priority for the team. Input endorsers technology will be a big step forward for the entire cryptocurrency space and Cardano will be one of the leaders when it comes to innovation. The community will very likely continue to grow and Cardano will win every poll. We can expect success in adoption from companies and countries. I don’t see much reason why it should be otherwise.

Sometimes we come across the opinion that there will be completely new projects that will overshadow the current ones and that there will be completely different projects in the top 10. That can happen, of course, but we don’t think so. There will certainly be a few new projects with a strong team and good funding, but there won’t be dozens of them. It takes a relatively long time, on the order of several years, to build a new protocol that is not a mere copy of the current ones. Once smart contracts can be used by third-party developers, it takes another few years for developers to learn how to use the platform and build secure services.

Currently, there are only a few relevant smart contract platforms in the cryptocurrency space. The IOG team will be constantly improving Cardano, so it will be very difficult for competitors to catch up with the development and deliver something significantly better. DeFi may literally explode on Cardano during the next bull market. The teams of completely new projects will likely build their protocol consensus. Cardano will very likely stay in the top 10.

During the last bull market, many PoW projects left the top 10 and will never return. Most of them were copies that did not bring any innovation. It turns out that once the speculative sentiment dies down, the project gradually fades into history.

The long-term sustainability of the protocol cannot be based on speculation or faith but on real utility. Users will only adopt useful services that offer them clear advantages over current solutions. Only the adoption and growth of the network effect can ensure the prosperity of public protocols.

### A broader perspective

Do you think stocks are a store of value? Apple shares have been trading since 1982, so almost 40 years. At the very beginning, they were worth about $0.05. At the time of writing, just under $150. You would find plenty of similar stocks in the market. Do you think the value could have risen for 40 years just based on speculation or traders’ beliefs? We can almost certainly conclude that it couldn’t. When investors look for reasons to buy a particular stock, they always look at what the company produces and what it is useful to the world. All large Internet companies are successful because of a strong network effect. The network effect only grows if there is demand for specific services.

We know Google for information retrieval. Facebook and Twitter are global social networks. Apple ships popular mobile phones all over the world. Each giant has dominated a specific sector. In some places, companies bump into each other and compete. The important point is that as long as companies are successful and the majority of the population uses their services, the stocks of these companies will serve as a good store of value.

Can cryptocurrencies be a good store of value? We believe so, but only if they deliver a useful service to the world that is globally adopted.

A blockchain project that fails to deliver utility is not sustainable in the long term and its relevance will fade with the interest in speculating on value growth. It may well be that Bitcoin is such a large phenomenon that the speculative nature is enough to sustain value. Relying on it can be tricky. No one knows this, as blockchain technologies are brand new unprecedented technologies. Anyway, no project other than Bitcoin can rely on faith and must deliver quality technology that will be in demand.

If we want to find out if Cardano will be relevant in 10–20 years, we must, first of all, ask if there will be demand for the technologies being developed. Secondly, we should be interested in the competition. In this article, we will focus only on technology.

The reality is that commercial banks are not afraid of Bitcoin. Some even allow their customers to buy cryptocurrency. It’s another asset for them to capitalize on through their customer service. Many people do not want to hold cryptocurrencies and prefer to entrust this service to a third party. Unclear regulations prevent banks from offering cryptocurrency-related services on a larger scale.

The world’s IT giants have a huge user base and have a lot of information about their users. If they tried to expand their business into finance, as Facebook has tried to do with Libra/Diem, it would be significant competition for banks. The introduction of CBDC is another real threat to commercial banks.

Bankers and other experts are watching the development of cryptocurrencies and are more worried about the technology itself than the monetary policy features of individual projects. What is interesting for banks and other finance-related businesses are globally available transaction networks that can transfer values in a Peer-to-Peer fashion, the ability to issue tokens and stablecoins, and smart contracts that allow building services on top of that.

Today, information can circulate around the world literally in a second. However, in the case of sending value, this would not be the case if blockchain technology did not exist. With blockchain, you can send value from the US to Europe, Asia, or Africa through one ecosystem. There is no need for two or more entities to agree on a transaction. The ability to send value anywhere in the world in a short while and for a low fee is a huge step forward. It is important to note that at the moment no blockchain network scales sufficiently, so this option only works to a limited extent. Further technological advances will enable this kind of interconnection.

Another huge innovation is the ability to hold value without an intermediary. All custody services will be automated and there will be no need for inefficient middlemen. If people get used to being responsible for their wealth, they will essentially stop needing bank accounts. As we wrote above, some people will not want to be their own bank and will be happy to use similar services. Banks can take advantage of this.

Greater connectivity of people through an independent network together with a decentralized identity will enable the creation of alternative financial services. Lending, one of the major businesses of banks, will be disrupted and smart contracts can fully automate many processes. However, banks may still offer assistance services.

Banks and new FinTech services will probably start using blockchain. It seems inevitable. Cardano is being built so that secure applications can be built on top of it. The software used by banks must meet high-quality standards and many use Haskell, the same programming language used to write Plutus scripts. It is difficult to predict what impact blockchain technology will have on commercial banks, as CBDC and IT giants may also play a significant role. In any case, banks can be expected to start using public blockchain networks sooner or later, and Cardano may appeal to them.

Everything may be different and it is possible that banks will not start using blockchain networks. In that case, new FinTech services that rely on blockchain may be successful. Some form of disruption will certainly occur, it is just hard to predict what it will ultimately look like.

Many companies can use the global network for their business. The potential is almost endless. Web3 can change the fundamental principles of the Internet as we know it today. The Internet has changed many industries, and it is to be expected that if the Internet changes, it will also affect the companies that use the Internet. New technologies open up new possibilities of use and sooner or later someone will take advantage of them.

Adoption of the Cardano network will be significantly faster through the current big players in the market using it. The cryptocurrency industry has not yet been able to deliver a globally used DeFi service that is massively popular. This can be attributed to unreliability, poor marketing, low scalability, and complexity of use. Large companies can change this and can integrate blockchain networks into their current solutions. Twitter has already integrated the use of NFT. Facebook is also experimenting with NFT. It’s only a matter of time before we see more integration.

The world of finance will change in the next decade and the current financial crisis may be the initiator of more widespread change. It will depend on how big the crisis is and what we want to change. Almost everyone is talking about the use of blockchain today. Adoption may be slower than we initially hoped, but it is continuing, which is important.

### People expect more from cryptocurrencies

The fall of projects like Celsius or Terra Luna says a lot about cryptocurrencies. Many people don’t want to just hold cryptocurrencies in their wallets and wait another 10 years for the value to possibly rise. Many people want to use their assets in some way. For example, as collateral or to provide passive income. People are naturally greedy and have little patience. That’s one reason they entrust their coins to centralized intermediaries. Natural human behavior is hard to change and it is okay for people to want to profit. The demand for platforms offering interest on deposits is clear. The question arises. Can such a platform be created on a decentralized basis?

To be a relevant alternative to banking services, the blockchain industry must be able to replicate mainstream financial services. This means that they must be able to provide interest on user deposits. People commonly use this option in the case of fiat currencies. The blockchain industry must also allow this in a decentralized form with cryptocurrencies. Decentralization as a concept will lose if people are forced to entrust cryptocurrencies to centralized entities for the sake of deposit interest.

Imagine if we wanted to build a decentralized world, but lending, one of the basic financial services, would continue to operate only on a centralized base. It would mean that banks would still have control over your money and personal data. States could order the bank to freeze your account. 

It doesn’t make sense to entrust cryptocurrencies to a centralized entity that will then use them as liquidity in DeFi services. Users can do the same from their own wallets. However, this is exactly what Celsius did. Celsius seems to have been a useless and unreliable proxy. If Celsius advised people for a modest fee which DeFi service to provide liquidity, people would still have control over their funds.

So here we have a demand for a service that people are very likely to want to use. The service would be useful and the network effect would be expected to grow rapidly. This is exactly the form of utility that we have been talking about. If such a DeFi service is implemented on Cardano, the platform will be useful and valuable as well.

People sometimes mistakenly think that if a project with a certain network effect already exists then the lead cannot be caught up. The entire crypto market is still relatively small and adoption is low. The overall market capitalization is based on speculation more than the utility. Blockchain networks of the future aren’t going to be defined by first to market or fastest to get network effect. They are always going to be defined by best under stress and most durable. 

We will see projects that appear and disappear again after a while because something bad happens during a market downturn. Just as we are seeing in the current bear market. Long-term vision and insistence on building quality and reliable technology are necessary prerequisites for any project to remain relevant for decades. A systematic and measured way using proper protocol design, peer review, and the application of formal methods will lead to success. Trying to be first to market with protocols that fail shortly after launch will only lead to daily dramas and loss of wealth.

People expect cryptocurrencies to be a reliable and well-functioning alternative to the financial world. Businesses expect a scalable and secure global network that they can rely on to expand their business. Banks will only hold cryptocurrencies in the first phase. In the next phase, they will start using them for their business. New alternative banks will emerge that make more use of decentralized networks than traditional technologies.

### Conclusion

Only strong projects that continue to develop technology, work towards wider adoption and build community will survive the bear market. We have no doubt that Cardano will survive and become an integral part of the cryptocurrency scene. Cardano combines the best features of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Using an Extended-UTXO that was inspired accounting model of Bitcoin. Cardano’s PoS is built on Nakamoto's consensus. Decentralized exchanges have been launched on Cardano, which no one has managed to hack so far. Many teams will be building their projects on Cardano during the bear market. Adoption in developing countries will continue. Every bear market will come to an end at some point. Survival will make Cardano an even stronger project.

# [Stock futures tick higher with all eyes on June’s inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as investors awaited a key inflation report that is expected to show a fresh high.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 82 points, or 0.26%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.31%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.41%.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index, slated for at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to climb by 8.8% in June on a year-over-year basis, according to Dow Jones’ survey of economists. That would be even higher than May’s 8.6% reading, which was the biggest increase since 1981.
*****
&gt; “The market is anticipating that June will be the new peak,” said Lindsey Bell, Ally’s chief markets and money strategist. “The reading is likely to confirm what the jobs report on Friday told us – that the Fed will stick to their aggressive rate tightening timeline.”
*****
&gt; The likely hot reading could prompt the central bank to hike another 75 basis points during this month’s meeting. Last month, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5%-1.75% in its most aggressive hike since 1994.
*****
&gt; “The Fed’s credibility will be tested in coming months with the release of inflation numbers and corporate earnings,” said Andy Sparks, head of portfolio management research at MSCI. “The Fed’s recent aggressive actions to bring down inflation also run the risk of overshooting, pushing an economy that had been showing signs of weakness into a full scale recession.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, investors will monitor second-quarter corporate earnings as major banks are set to report this week. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are slated to post results Thursday before the bell. Delta Air Lines reports before the bell Wednesday.

personalfinance,How to pay for law school with 40k in savings?,"Hi all.

How should I tackle debt accrued from law school tuition and cost of living?

I'll be starting law school at a T-14 with a 100k tuition scholarship. Total tuition is expected to be 200k, with cost of living around 85k. So. Total cost is 285k.

I have around 40k in savings.

Let's pretend I'll have the grades to be employed in a biglaw firm for my summers and after graduation, which means I'll have around 15k after every summer. In other words: 40k before law school, 15k for my second year, and 15k for my third year, totaling around 70k in savings.

Since I have to pay 35k for tuition for my first year, should I throw most of my 40k savings into that and take out federal loans for cost of living (~25k)? 

If I save and plan well, then I won't owe any debt for tuition but have federal loans out just for living expenses (again, around 85k by the time I graduate). Would this be the smartest route? I'm open to any suggestions and advice 🙂",finance,1657714959
stocks,USA Consumer Price Index for June 2022 year-on-year is 9.1%,"CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - JUNE 2022

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.3 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 1.0 percent in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 9.1 percent before seasonal adjustment.

The increase was broad-based, with the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food being the largest contributors. The energy index rose 7.5 percent over the month and contributed nearly half of the all items increase, with the gasoline index rising 11.2 percent and the other major component indexes also rising. The food index rose 1.0 percent in June, as did the food at home index.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.7 percent in June, after increasing 0.6 percent in the preceding two months. While almost all major component indexes increased over the month, the largest contributors were the indexes for shelter, used cars and trucks, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, and new vehicles. The indexes for motor vehicle repair, apparel, household furnishings and operations, and recreation also increased in June. Among the few major component indexes to decline in June were lodging away from home and airline fares.

**The all items index increased 9.1 percent for the 12 months ending June, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1981.** The all items less food and energy index rose 5.9 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index rose 41.6 percent over the last year, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending April 1980. The food index increased 10.4 percent for the 12-months ending June, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending February 1981.

investing,"Bank of Canada increases policy interest rate by 100 basis points, continues quantitative tightening","[BoC](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/07/fad-press-release-2022-07-13/)

The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 2½%, with the Bank Rate at 2¾% and the deposit rate at 2½%. The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening (QT).

Inflation in Canada is higher and more persistent than the Bank expected in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR), and will likely remain around 8% in the next few months. While global factors such as the war in Ukraine and ongoing supply disruptions have been the biggest drivers, domestic price pressures from excess demand are becoming more prominent. More than half of the components that make up the CPI are now rising by more than 5%. With this broadening of price pressures, the Bank’s core measures of inflation have moved up to between 3.9% and 5.4%. Also, surveys indicate more consumers and businesses are expecting inflation to be higher for longer, raising the risk that elevated inflation becomes entrenched in price- and wage-setting. If that occurs, the economic cost of restoring price stability will be higher.

Global inflation is higher, reflecting the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ongoing supply constraints, and strong demand. Many central banks are tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, and the resulting tighter financial conditions are moderating economic growth. In the United States, high inflation and rising interest rates are contributing to a slowdown in domestic demand. China’s economy is being held back by waves of restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Oil prices remain high and volatile. The Bank now expects global economic growth to slow to about 3½% this year and 2% in 2023 before strengthening to 3% in 2024.

Further excess demand has built up in the Canadian economy. Labour markets are tight with a record low unemployment rate, widespread labour shortages, and increasing wage pressures. With strong demand, businesses are passing on higher input and labour costs by raising prices. Consumption is robust, led by a rebound in spending on hard-to-distance services. Business investment is solid and exports are being boosted by elevated commodity prices. The Bank estimates that GDP grew by about 4% in the second quarter. Growth is expected to slow to about 2% in the third quarter as consumption growth moderates and housing market activity pulls back following unsustainable strength during the pandemic.

The Bank expects Canada’s economy to grow by 3½% in 2022, 1¾% in 2023, and 2½% in 2024. Economic activity will slow as global growth moderates and tighter monetary policy works its way through the economy. This, combined with the resolution of supply disruptions, will bring demand and supply back into balance and alleviate inflationary pressures. Global energy prices are also projected to decline. The July outlook has inflation starting to come back down later this year, easing to about 3% by the end of next year and returning to the 2% target by the end of 2024.

With the economy clearly in excess demand, inflation high and broadening, and more businesses and consumers expecting high inflation to persist for longer, the Governing Council decided to front-load the path to higher interest rates by raising the policy rate by 100 basis points today. The Governing Council continues to judge that interest rates will need to rise further, and the pace of increases will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and inflation. Quantitative tightening continues and is complementing increases in the policy interest rate. The Governing Council is resolute in its commitment to price stability and will continue to take action as required to achieve the 2% inflation target.",finance,1657722180

It is an 18 month CD with 7 months remaining. Their terms say: ""If your CD has a maturity of twelve (12) months or less, the penalty we impose will equal ninety (90) days' simple interest on the amount withdrawn subject to penalty. If your CD has a maturity greater than twelve (12) months, the penalty we impose will equal one hundred eighty (180) days' simple interest on the amount withdrawn subject to penalty."" They're saying because it is an 18 Month CD, it's always going to be the 180 days of interest, but I read it as since the maturity is only 7 months it should be 90 days.

stocks,"Historically, what are best practices during high inflation / high CPI?","In response to the latest CPI news, I'm thinking back to periods where CPI was even higher in the USA. The Great Inflation of the early 1980's jumps out as an extended period of super-high CPI. During this period, I have read that the sectors hit hardest were ones that relied heavily on borrowing (eg. manufacturing and construction). This period of time saw a high unemployment rate, a shrinking GDP, and a ""stop and go"" oscillation of Fed Rate changes.

Are there any good parallels to draw with the current state of the economy? Were there sectors during the Great Inflation that over-performed or under-performed, and is the market at all likely to repeat a similar path? I know that many of the major players and growth stocks of today didn't even exist back then. I also know that nobody holds a ""crystal ball"". I'm just hoping for some insights into what successful investment looked like during that timeframe.

personalfinance,Moving from LCOL to MCOL area,"Hi everyone, I had an opportunity come up recently that I have been back and forth on, so I wanted to get r/personalfinance opinion.

My wife and I currently live in a LCOL area in AZ. We do not hate the area, but it is not our dream locale to live in. It has very little as far as shopping, restaurants, things to do, etc. The weather is better in winter, but summer (such as this week), has highs in the day of 117. Other than summer/winter there are no real seasons.

We own a 3 bedroom/2 bathroom/2.5 car garage. The house is on a 15 yr fixed mortgage at 2.75%. I pay $1550 monthly. Our house was recently appraised at 278k, with 200k left on the mortgage, so hopefully if we can sell it we could net around $50k. 

My current income is $40/hourly.
I recently received a job offer in Prescott, AZ. The offer is identical in schedule to my current position, same benefits, and potentially even less work than I currently do. They offered me $55/hourly. We love the Prescott area as we have some family in that area that we visit. The weather is much nicer all year round, and there is more to do as far as shopping, dining, and outside due to the weather and environment. It is an area we talked about moving to once our house was paid off here. So we are definitely considering the move now that I have the offer.

The only downside is the housing costs in Prescott are much higher, and for us to be in an equal quality of housing, we are looking at houses in the $350k-400k range. In addition, interest rates are much higher right now. For a house in that range, our monthly on a 30 year is about $1700-1900. I used a calculator and increasing our payments to around $2500/month will pay off the house in 15 years. 

Does it seem stupid to “throw away” this house and interest rate that we have? I know it is hard to put a value on what you want where you live, but any advice or input or experiences in similar situations?

Thank you.",finance,1657724197
personalfinance,Should I reallocate some of a Intermediate Bond Fund to a Short Term Bond Fund ?,"I'm retired as of this year.

My retirement account's fixed income consists of two years living expenses in cash, and six years living expenses in intermediate bond funds. (Living expenses = actual expenses - social security).

If I had thought this through a long time ago, I would have preferred to have something like 2 years cash, 3 years short term, 3 years long term, or something like that, in order to minimize the kind of interest rate risk we are now witnessing.

I think it might make sense to reallocate 1-3 years' worth of my intermediate bond fund to a short term bond fund.

However, my intermediate bond fund has lost about 10% this year. When interest rates drop, I would expect this bond fund to recover most/all of the money. If I sell it now and switch to short term bond funds, I will be locking in those losses. On the other hand, if inflation continues for the next several years, and interest rates keep increasing, perhaps switching to short term would be better.

investing,Bombardier preferred shares,"[BBD.PR.B](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BBD.PR.B) (series 2 preferred shares) are exchangeable 1:1 for [BBD.PR.D](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BBD.PR.D) (series 3 preferred shares) once every five years.  That is happening now (well, deadline is 5:00PM EDT on July 18, effective for August 1.. although brokers have an earlier deadline for beneficial shareholders).

Series 2 pays a floating monthly dividend based on the Canadian prime rate (most recently at a rate equivalent to $0.92/share, based on the last distribution of $0.0767).  The BOC raised rates by 100 basis points, so this will very likely increase (I project - based on simple math that may not be accurate -  $0.976/month, or $1.17/share annually).

Series 3 pays a fixed quarterly dividend, resetting every five years (corresponding with the exchange date).  BBD [just announced](https://bombardier.com/en/media/news/bombardier-announces-dividend-rate-applicable-its-series-3-preferred-shares-2) that, as of August 1, the dividend will be $1.147/share annually (if my math is right).

As of time of this writing, BBD.PR.B is trading at $16.80, and BBD.PR.D is trading at $17.99.  From that sense, there appears to be almost an arbitrage opportunity (probably technically not.. but maybe as close as regular investors can hope for :) ) for owners of BBD.PR.B.

But I don't understand why the market, in this time of rising interest rates, values the fixed dividend shares higher.

Help me analyze this.  If you owned shares, would you do the exchange?

economy,#1 Insight and Hindsight: economic prospects and the impact on your finance,"It has always been surprising to see people reading carefully the manual of their latest gadgets while ditching information about their own personal finance. As I’ve been investing on the stock exchange since 2002 (forget wannabee GameStop traders), while surviving several crises, my point of view may help. I believe I can “guess what the music might do” (check “Margin call” movie).

Of course, you are free not to believe me, especially as my current project is about travel (see [karambol.io](https://www.karambol.io/)) and not finance. However, finance was my academic background and I did see the implosion of the mortgage industry from the inside. Let’s agree to agree or to disagree! Here are my predictions and some solutions.

**1) There will be a recession. The question is more about its intensity, varying from mild to the end of the world \[2023\]**  
We are in the unknown as this is only the second time in modern history that central banks stop buying bonds while rising interest rates at a super rapid pace. Some may recall the first time (2013 taper tantrum). Buckle up! Either turn everything into cash (safe approach) or short the market (risky but potentially rewarding approach). A potential timing to sell the market: ceasefire in Ukraine followed by a market rebound.

**2) Euro value is at stake \[2023\]**  
I wouldn’t talk about Euro existence… yet. The European Central Bank is stuck between the high level of inflation and the fate of Italy whose cost of borrowing is skyrocketing: moderate to high risk to see a remake of the 2010 European debt crisis in various flavors. Some possible investment: New Zealand obligations (extremely safe, exchange rate not too bad in comparison to USD) and, on a longer investment horizon, Chinese obligations (the Yuan is expected to become as important as the EUR and USD as reserve currency, limiting arbitrary devaluation).

**3) Poor countries will face unrests \[2023\]**  
The inflation is making life particularly hard for the poorest. Think of Sri Lanka. It wouldn’t be the only country. Recommendation: if you’re on the stock exchange, check the exposure of your portfolio.

**4) US, Australian and Canadian housing market will turn ugly \[Mid 2023, 2024\]**  
We’re not in the 2008 financial crisis situation. But if you own houses and appartements, it may be the time to turn everything into cash, become yourself a tenant and buy everything back 2 to 3 years from now. If you’re a first-time buyer, wait. These advices apply to other countries as it is heavily correlated to situation 1).

**5) Bit… what? \[now\]**  
Last but not least: Bitcoin and cryptos in general. It seems that the total valuation of cryptos exceeding the gross domestic product of the most developed countries didn’t raise an eyebrow… until recently. Except for specific cases (hiding money, money laundry, poor countries with very unstable currencies etc.), I never understood the craze. The kind of variation you get on that market could be replicated on shares, stock index and so on, with the guaranty that your custodian account-holders won’t disappear overnight, while representing real asset values. Cryptos are living a 2008 financial crisis on their own with its lack of regulation, shady operations and leverage products. Many other actors are expected to disappear.

**TDLR: Turn everything into cash. You may lose some money because of inflation but you won’t cumulate two negative effects.**

retirement,"Do you do a Bucket system with your Bonds? 2 years cash, 3 years short term, the rest in intermediate term, etc?","My fixed income portion of my retirement portfolio is entirely allocated to an intermediate bond fund. This of course has tripped me up this year due to the interest rate increases which have led to a 10% loss in my bond fund.

I have been considering an alternative bucket system, where for example you would put 2 years living expenses in cash, 3 years in short term bond funds, with the remainder in intermediate bond funds.

Let's assume you withdraw equally from your stocks and bonds, once per year. With the bucket fixed income system, you can chose from which buckets to withdraw. Now that bonds are down due to interest rate increases, you could withdraw from cash and from short term bonds. In later years you could instead withdraw from short term bonds.

I'm a big fan of Tom Bilyeu's channel Impact Theory - tons of great interviews with big contributors to all parts of society.

As someone who works in and has a background in finance (fintech specifically), I found a lot of what's discussed here to be a really good explanation of the ""world state"". It's newbie-friendly but at the same time touches on some very complex subjects. And yes there's plenty of crypto talk. Some of things discussed:

&amp;#x200B;

* FED vs. market involvement &amp; monetary policy (efficient market vs. tinkering)
* Psychology - natural human tendency to borrow against future self
* Leverage
* Plenty of crypto tips - DCA, HODL, taking profits, etc.
* Worldwide macro economic conditions
* Effects of wars
* Labor market environment
* Housing market environment
* Recession
* Population surge (generational) effects on economies

About 1.5 hours, but a very engaging discussion and if you really want to start wrapping your head around important fundamental ideas (which will likely send you on a bunch of different knowledge chases), this is a solid piece.

personalfinance,USA - advice about a *small* windfall?,"My partner and I (late 30s, just us) are about to get around $10,000 in one-time post-tax surprise income. We are discussing the best thing to do with it, among a few options. I would appreciate some advice.  

For context, our gross income is ~$125K. We moved pre-pandemic from an extremely expensive city (where our lower salaries barely covered necessities and we could not build liquid savings) to a cheaper one, but the pandemic has driven up the price of everything so our situation is not as comfortable as we were hoping.  

The best options for the $, we think, are as follows:

1. I have a well-funded retirement account, but my partner has basically zero. He only recently got a job that encouraged opening an account and matches his salary etc. Before that he was a nonprofit wage slave for 15 years. Should we use this money to kickstart his new 403b?

2. We moved in hopes of accumulating savings and quickly buying a house, but the average price has skyrocketed in the past two years. We have close to $30K in our ""down payment"" fund (that doubles as our emergency fund) but lately in our city it's $400K for the smallest most rundown houses. With interest rates and prices what they are, we will not be buying for a while. Should we sock this money into the down payment fund?

3. I have no student loans but my husband has at least $25K outstanding, and has been involved in an ongoing saga involving refinancing, forbearance, etc. He could definitely plop this $10K down and ease this burden. Should he?  

4. Is there some 4th thing we should look into? We could also spend this money on specific household nice-to-haves that are not strictly essential, such as buying a car, but that doesn't seem like the best idea.

The consumer price index (CPI), a broad measure of everyday goods and services related to the cost of living, rose 9.1% from a year earlier, the largest gain since the end of 1981, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday. Dow Jones expected the inflation measure to be around 8.8%.

CryptoCurrency,In-depth analysis: Here's what the CPI data is telling us. The bad news and the good news. What it will mean for the market:,"The biggest crypto market is still the US (hopefully that will be more balanced in the future). And right now, one of the many concerns in this market is US inflation.

CPI is up 1.3%, hitting a high of 9.1%.

That's 9.1% over the last 12 months.

Core CPI is up 5.9% (it was 6% in May).

CPI is a lagging metric, so it really measured the June outcome of the effect inflation has previously had.

# The breakdown:

Energy, housing, and food have been the most problematic.

Energy is the biggest culprit. Accounting for over 26% increase.

# The energy problem:

The gasoline part alone of the energy section rose by 11%.

Energy commodities (fuel oil and gasoline), accounted for 21.6%.

# Core CPI, a different story:

Core CPI doesn't take into account food and energy.

So it can give us a clue how things would do, if it wasn't for the energy problem.

Core CPI has actually peaked back in April, and has been in decline.

Higher CPI means higher Fed rates. Potentially 100 bps. But definitely at least 75 bps.

That's a very fast increase, and could put a lot of stress on the market.

All the while we have some other bad news like the Chinese economy slowly collapsing.

The target is still only around 3%. So the cost of borrowing will still be cheap, just not near 0. To put things into perspective, between 2005 and 2007, rates were over 3%. And the economy and stocks were in a bull market.

The issue is more how fast they increase, and that the market got used to near 0 rates.

&amp;#x200B;

# The good news:

\-OPEC has been increasing its output. And we can already see the price of oil drop from $122 down to $95.

That's important as energy (mainly oil) is the biggest culprit. 

The problem is they aren't able to operate at full capacity yet. Renewed unrest in Libya and Nigeria has made OPEC miss its targeted outputs.

Along with still limitations in refinery capacity, and supply chain. But OPEC is still aiming to increase output.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Supply chain, one of the problems that can also help improve the oil and energy situation, as well as the food situation, has been slowly improving.

China and Europe have had setbacks, but ports and shipments in the US have been improving.

The current drop in oil prices will also help transportation.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The housing market is cooling off.

Median sales price are still high, but are slowing down to a grinding halt. Sales on the other hand are beginning to drop while inventory is beginning to increase again as the supply chain of lumber is recovering.

A correction seems imminent.

Unfortunately, it will be a while before we see any improvement on housing cost, especially if price drops are too slow to outpace mortgage rates.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Markets price in the future, not the current situation.

For markets like stocks and crypto, it's more the future outlook that matters.

While the current situation is dire for main street, and will likely be for several months, markets are speculative, and speculate on future value.

The market will buy ahead of the news, and buy a recovery prematurely when there's the first hint and rumors that the worse is over, or that the wheels are already in motion.

&amp;#x200B;

# Where to look to stay ahead?

Considering how big of a factor energy has been, it makes it a little easier to simplify that process.

Keep an eye on the energy market first, then supply chain.

And it all boils down to what happens in Libya, Nigeria, and with the oil refineries and transportation of oil.

Those will tell you where, when, and how far along the recovery will be.",cryptocurrency,1657739231
Bitcoin,Debate: Are Uncollateralised Personal Loan Bad?,"1. Let’s assume you take a 7year loan today at 5% interest rate per annum for a loan amount of $50k.

2. Assume next bull cycle after halving is in 3 years (mid-2025). Lets say it goes up to minimum $100k per Bitcoin.

3. Over the 3 years you pay ~$30k back in total. ($50k*(5%*7years+1)/7).

4. $50k buys +2 bitcoins today. In 2025 you’ll have $200k less remaining loan amount of ~$40k.

Yes taking out a loan means leverage and it’s “risky”. But if the loan is uncollateralised, then there is no margin call risk. Note this is what Saylor is doing.

stocks,What if FED raised the rate to 100%,"In order to understand how things work it is often useful to consider an extreme example. So to better understand the consequences of raising the rates by 0.5%, 1% or 2%, and also just for fun, let's consider what would happen if the rates would rise to 100%.

So there it happend, JPow got completely mad and you get up in the morning and see the FED rates stand at 100%. What happens next?

Would people cut spending and put all their savings into the 100% yielding government bonds? Do everybody just sell all the stocks and load up on bonds? Do commercial banks stop any credit action and also load up on bonds? So can all the businesses finance themselves anyhow?

Businesses would probably just switch to overseas banks and borrow in Euro for example. Borrowing in euro eventually generates a lot of demand for it as just like with every credit you need to pay back more than you got. So this looks like a reason for the dollar to loose against the euro.
Its also clear that everybody would ask where the government is going to find the money to pay so huge interest and everybody would obviously know that the only option is printing a lot of new money. So that really looks like something very pro-inflatory and also bad for the dollar.
Normally rising rates damages the economy but wouldn't so huge hike lead to just switching to an alternative currency and at the end the impact to the real economy would not be so huge? So then maybe so huge hike would not really lead to everybody selling all the stocks and loading up US bonds because people would just completely loose trust in the dollar, and the bonds denominated in it, and keep holding stocks which have fundamental value: businesses produce real products and provide services really needed by everybody.

Of course what would really happen is the FED leadership would be just changed and the insane changes reverted. But if not I think the result would be a total collapse of the dollar, which is counterintuitive because normally the currency strengthens when the rates are raised.",finance,1657749001

stocks,CPI clarification and discussion,"I'm interested in clarifying and discussing these points on CPI. 

A. FED prefers PCE data as metric for inflation not CPI. 

&gt;The CPI measures the change in the out-of-pocket expenditures of all urban households and the PCE index measures the change in goods and services consumed by all households, and nonprofit institutions serving households.  

I guess this is significant because CPI measures prices which might not be because of inflation. AKA sanctions on Russia, oil price fixing. EVs and used car prices....these things cost more for reasons other than oversupply of money. Remove the sanctions, increase the cartels oil production, un-eliminate ICE vehicles so people aren't scrambling to get them to use for parts later.  Because the reality is people actually don't have money to spend which is the opposite of inflation but the CPI says otherwise because of the above.

B. FED uses headline inflation which includes energy and food. That is what Powell said during the last FOMC press meeting. 

Significant because these are the things people have to pay for if they have money or not. Also as stated above, the reading is not necessarily due to inflation. Beating a dead horse when I say, I can tell you my service will cost you 2X more now just because I can afford to. So since my price is higher and is used to measure how much money you have, it doesn't mean you have more money. You can't afford it but my buddy will pay it so I make the same amount. Spoiler, my buddy gets his money to pay the increased costs from you in taxes or loans.  

C. The CPI data is a month behind.   
You can track commodity, energy, used car prices and everything else on the stock market or whatever live. You can calculate it ahead of time. It shouldn't be a surprise. But it was. In hindsight you can find reports that were correct. These reports actually tracked the prices and calculated the CPI. The overall estimates were based on guesses and not actual data calculations. WTF is an ""estimate"" these days because we need a way to distinguish a calculation based on data vs someone's asshole.",finance,1657752307

personalfinance,Went back to school and my finances are falling apart. Need help,"Hey everyone, 

As mentioned in the title I went back to school to become an engineer. I am currently 25 years old and am going into my third of year of school this fall. Will graduate in spring of 2025. 

Before going back to school I had been employed full time at our small family business for around 9 years (worked all through high school there). Made decent money, ~45k gross per year. Bought a house for 65k in 2016. My dad co-signed on the mortgage. Overall was doing pretty okay financially, especially for my age at the time. 

Bought a used truck in late 2019, before deciding to go back to school, for 26k. Still owe 13k on it. Is still worth around what I paid for it currently due to increase in used truck prices. 

So fast forwarding to now, I am still working at our business, but far less. School is around an hour away and it tends to be very time consuming. Engineering school is no joke! Essentially I work when I can— some weekends, summer break, and winter break. Overall this has decreased my income to around 15k a year give or take. 

This has put me into a bit of a hole. I am now 15k in credit card debt. My dad was gracious enough to take on my house payment of 380 a month until I graduate and can pay him back, so I don’t have that to worry about. But I still pay electric, water, internet, gas, and anything else associate with owning a house. Those seriously add up. 

My house was also a bit of a fixer upper and I have been working on it so that I can sell it at some point when I have other housing lined up (likely after graduating). 

I pay rent at school as well. $550 per month, 9 months out of the year. I am fortunate enough that between some federal aid and some other grants my tuition bill is usually only around 10k, which I pay for with a federal student loan each year. No room and board as I live off campus. I buy books used or sometimes not at all if I think I can get away with it.

Overall I’m fairly frugal, I don’t eat out too much, don’t really spend money on random shit. I do have a few streaming services probably adding up to 40-50 bucks a month. 

I guess I just need some advice on where to go from here. I have consistently gotten more broke and in debt with each passing month I’m in school. I really don’t want this to continue for 3 more years.  Any ideas would be highly appreciated.

Edit: I’ll add a quick recap of my finances at them moment. 

Truck payment-560/month, 13k left on loan

CC debt-15k

Mortgage-380/month dad pays, 38k left

Savings- none I burned through them

Checking- basically nothing, live paycheck to paycheck

Credit score-615, would go up massively if I could pay down CC debt. Around 80% utilization. Nothing else bad on my credit.",finance,1657758976
personalfinance,What should I do with inheritance given my lifestyle/goals?,"With my mother passing, I’m receiving $125k. There are a few things to consider. I come from a pretty broken family in the sense that when I lost my job due to covid, my family didn’t help at all. It was a friend who supported me at the time. I know if I were ever to face a financial hardship, I need to be prepared because I can not rely on my family for help.

I am 24. I work in federal government so my job is very stable. I have a pension. I invest 5% of my pay into our TSP (retirement account) and with matching, I invest a total of $10k annually. Right now, my financial health has not been the best. I make $60k a year but after deductions, I take home $3k and half of that goes to rent. I am getting a $10k raise next month. I’m in a promotional ladder that will have me making a little over $100k in 2 more years and then it plateaus. 

Here are my main personal finance goals:
1) get a car ( I plan on getting a regular, reliable car but I’ve been really struggling without one.)
2) create emergency fund 

Other things to consider (I don’t have enough for all these but will have enough to put some money into the goal(s). 
1) buying a home: I used to want a home to build equity. However, I am single and really drawn to a convenience lifestyle. I do not want to worry about unexpected repairs/maintenance/stress of owning a home. I get the idea that owning a home by the time you retire is important but I’m like even if I wait ten years, I will still have time to pay off a 20 year mortgage. I just found an apartment with all the amenities I could want (gym, rooftop pool, hot tub, community events, coworking spaces) for $1300/month. 2 br Condos/townhomes are like $1600/month mortage in my area without amenities or including tax. I do feel bad about “throwing money away” on rent but it just doesn’t fit my lifestyle right now. If I was married and could split the cost or was already making 6 figures, it would be different.
2) pay off federal student loan debt: My loans are all federal. They total $83k for undergrad/grad school. The lowest interest rate is 2.6%, the highest is 5%. I don’t like the idea of an ongoing debt payment but under PSLF and income based repayments, I will likely wind up paying about $47k before the balance is forgiven. So it seems best to wait.
3) additional retirement savings: since I don’t plan on having kids/grandkids, I think I will have more money to invest throughout my career. I don’t want to add to the fund right now beyond my current contribution.
4) rainy day money: not an emergency fund but I want to have cash I can access for the future. Maybe for when I get married, want to go on a big trip, when it’s time for my next car, etc. Essentially money that is in a high yield savings account that can be withdrawn.
5) investing: I understand some of this should be invested.",finance,1657760247

Up until now, affording college has been relatively easy due to Covid relief funds and a large private scholarship. This year is different due to the loss of both of these, and a substantial increase in cost of tuition. Right now, I have $10K in federal student loan debt, and thankfully no private loan debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

After aid through the school, this coming year will cost $28,600 in total, including room and board. I will receive $7,500 in federal loans, bringing the cost to $21,100. In addition, I have the opportunity to work a job that will grant me a $7,800 stipend, bringing the cost to $13,300. However, I really prefer not to work this job due to the extremely excessive demands that come with the job. I won't detail much about the job here, but I feel like my life is entirely drained by the job. I do not have access to savings which I can use for the coming year, and I do not receive any assistance from my family.  By the time I graduate, at worst, I will have about $67,000 ($25,000 federal loans+$42,000 private loans) in debt. At best, I will have about $51,000 ($25,000 federal loans+$26,000 private loans) in debt. This does not account for accumulated interest, either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will I be paying too much for college now? Are there any resources which I can use to make this more affordable? Should I transfer out, and finish my degree elsewhere, or just bite the bullet and finish my degree here? I am hesitant to take out private loans, just because I have seen loved ones in insurmountable debt after undergrad.

CryptoMarkets,"XRP news everywhere! Judge Netburn tells the SEC 'you're hypocrites', Former Ripple board member Barr new Fed chief, McCaleb (XLM) nearly done dumping","My goodness friends, what a week for Ripple. XRP holders, catalysts abound yet we remain stuck in by the bears. Let's do a quick recap anyway, and hope that the market begins to reflect the bullish news:

Michael Barr Confirmed: Michael Barr, a former Ripple adviser, is set to assume one of the most important U.S. regulatory roles after winning Senate confirmation to be vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Barr is considered an ally to crypto, but has tempered his sentiments with expectations that the market be regulated robustly. This appointment is widely considered good for crypto, and considering it's issues with the SEC - good for Ripple.

Netburn says 'the Hinman emails must be produced': The long awaited ruling has finally come down from Circuit Judge Sarah Netburn regarding the attorney-client privilege of conversations had with SEC lawyers by William Hinman. Judge Netburn unequivocally ruled in favor of Ripple, even slamming the 'hypocrisy' of the SEC in its attempted defense - asserting that the SEC isn't even attempting to follow the law in good faith. In his now infamous speech Hinman said that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not to be considered securities, despite ETH having conducted the same kind of unregistered token offerings as Ripple. The preperatory emails Hinmam exchanged with SEC lawyers have been desperately guarded to this point, and it remains to be seen what the SEC will do. It seems likely that there will be a series of appeals to Judge Analise Torres, who is responsible for ruling on any appeals to Judge Netburn's decisions.

Jed's dead baby: Former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb is almost done selling his 9 billion XRP after nearly 8 years. Jed left Ripple after having differences with the leadership team on the direction of the project there. Jed has since worked to bring Stellar (XLM) into the crypto space as a competitor to Ripple within the global payment settlement industry. It is believed that Jed has nearly completed selling his stack of XRP, (he holds approximately 10 million in his TacoStand account) which is estimated to be gone by weeks end. XRP fans are ecstatic about this, as the downward selling pressure has been significant from McCaleb for nearly a decade.

Other notes: Did you know that Ripple only controls about 5% of nodes on the XRPL? XRP is more decentralized than many crypto projects. The community drives most innovations on chain as well, and will soon deliver Smart Contracts to XRPL in a 100% community driven effort, minus any Ripple devs. Congrats!

personalfinance,Should I sell my home and use the equity to not have to work while I go to school for my undergrad?,"Some background:

I bought my condo in 2019 at $220K and it's now worth nearly $400K (got in at a very lucky time lol!) which leaves me with about $175K of equity.

I am dealing with a variety of chronic illnesses that is making it harder and harder to work—currently I'm taking medical leave, I'm on my last week of FMLA before I return to work and I'm dreading it because even though I like my job, it takes a lot out of me.

I'd like to go back to school and get a four year degree, but I know with my health issues there's no way I can work AND go to school at the same time. I'm planning on going in-state to a really good but semi-affordable school and I qualify for a decent amount of financial aid.

Currently I make about $38,000/year (take home pay=what I actually really spend=$35000ish per year)

I've been pretty meticulously budgeting and taking into account my tendency to spend on more frivolous stuff (listen... I like stuff...) so I know how much I spend per year with wiggle room.

The plan for a while was to keep my place and move and use my place as a rental property—I'm still a good 20ish years from paying it off and using it as a passive income stream, but based off of fair rental prices in the area, I could take home $400/month from it.

So basically my options are:

* Sell my place and live off of the equity for 4 years (a conservative guess that leaves room for medical emergencies and such) so I can go to school
* Sell my place and live off of HALF the equity ($88K) and live off of that for 2.5 years, doing summer semesters/more credits to finish school up quicker and still have enough in savings to put a down payment on another house
* DON'T sell my place and rent it out while I rent a place (the $400 would go directly into the place I'd be renting and overall my monthly expenses would lower significantly because I could downsize, however, I'd still need to work while going to school for this option)

I still have details to figure out if I'd need to use some of my equity to actually pay for school, and I haven't appraised my home or anything, so I don't have exact numbers to work with anyway.

So I guess my question is, with all of these options, there's a lot I need to consider.

* If I put $88K away to put down on a future home, are there investment portfolios or high yield savings accounts that I could keep my money in to let it build over the next few years to keep up with inflation so my money doesn't lose too much value?
   * (I know high yield savings accounts don't really increase money much BUT I could at least maybe keep up with inflation that way)
* If I didn't put any money away, is this a stupid thing to do? Is this the last chance I'm ever going to have to buy property based on how the market is and is going to be?
* Would it be stupid to sell my place when I've locked in a really good interest rate that might be the lowest it's going to ever be again? Is this taking a step back financially?
* Also, are there any tax considerations to take into account with selling my home and the equity? Where does that money actually physically go after the sale? (Might sound like dumb questions but I'm only in my mid-20s and I don't know much about this stuff)

I currently don't have any debt except for my mortgage and my car and I'd really like to avoid going into debt as much as possible, if I can. I'd probably pay off my car immediately if I sold my place to get rid of a $300/month expense right off the bat anyway.

Sorry if this was long, I know it's kind of complex. Also—it's okay if the advice that I get here is ""consult with an actual personal finance advisor"" because yeah, probably, but also, I'd like a starting place and for more things to consider that may not have occurred to me relating to this situation.

CryptoCurrency,Reverse Rug Pull- Higher than Expected Inflation Leads to Market Rally,"I'm sure many of you were checking the charts this morning and saw markets dump after the CPI report came in at 9.1% (vs the 8.8% consensus). The narrative was that **higher inflation would mean quicker rate hikes by the US Fed**. That was supposed to Bearish, right? Below is my take based on analyzing the price action.

As markets flushed 1 hour before US equities opened, institutional money showed their hand. **$SPY** 373 was a prior support area that has held up 3 times in the past few weeks. It is a **line in the sand** where demand pressure has outweighed supply pressure. Inflection points such as these require **big money** to halt and reverse price, especially on multiple occasions. Think herd mentality.

[S&amp;P 500 1h chart - Held $373 support area where price previously bounced 3 times](https://preview.redd.it/tpc0l3nbwgb91.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54a5b953eb1abf271588c168cbc4dd8839e0ca5c)

Anyone blindly following amateur opinions or media narratives might have panic sold during the dump. Even worst, some day traders shorted at the opening bell only to be squeezed by the Bulls who were in full control of the trading session. Here are the stacked charts for **$SPY** and **$BTC** which show how similar the price action was.

[$BTC held the line as Buyers took back control from Sellers](https://preview.redd.it/gqsexwoqxgb91.png?width=855&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14832bc30f6804c924513424e84e17be3a594ab0)

Let's take a look at the revised estimates for the probability of a 1% rate hike at the next Fed meeting: from **8% chance yesterday to 82% chance today**. That is how quickly markets can pivot and price in future events; price action hinted at how institutions were digesting the shifting dynamic in real-time.

As I have been alluding to in [recent posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vvvb0b/market_red_pill_why_fundamentals_and_technical/), everything you need to know is right there in front of you on the charts. **Each candlestick provides clues into the relationship between supply/demand**. And within that, the emotions, psychology, entries, and exits of the institutional whales who dictate the ebbs and flows of the market. Analyzing and reacting always beats opinion and predicting.

I will leave you with the current daily chart of Bitcoin. We are rangebound until buyers are able to overcome $22.5k, or sellers can drive price below $18.5k. Watch the stock market for clues as to which side will set the tone until the much anticipated FOMC meeting on July 27th. **Today's bounce was relatively constructive for the time being.**

8. Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that there was a press call with “people familiar with the drafting of the bill” where Cardano was mentioned as falling under the “ancillary asset” category in the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill.

CryptoMarkets,How to Survive and Profit in Bear Markets?,"The year 2021 was highly fertile for crypto traders and investors. Most crypto assets have updated their all-time high, showing users an unprecedented bullish rally. This situation has prompted millions of new traders to jump on the bandwagon and get their piece of the pie. Nevertheless, such a sharp growth was followed by an equally sharp fall. Such a scenario is usual for the crypto market. By opening the price chart of the same Bitcoin, you will see that the market is cyclical and constantly experiencing ups and downs. However, what we call a bear market is a challenging psychological time for traders and investors. How can you compensate for losses or even make a profit in a bear market? Let’s look at it in today’s article.

https://preview.redd.it/400bv8i9vhb91.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d538a2265785c86f0044890761ecc685ee5cd88

### What Is a Bear Market?

A bear market is a decrease in asset quotations by at least 20% from recent highs. During this period, there is a panic in the market, sales volumes are increasing, and opponents of cryptocurrencies rejoice that the bubble has burst. Inexperienced traders are especially susceptible to herd instinct, so they close their positions. However, a bearish period is the best time to enter the market and diversify your portfolio. By opening the Bitcoin price chart, you will see that its price is growing yearly, despite periods of decline. The trader needs to be patient, get certain skills, and wait for the trend reversal.

### How to Earn Crypto in a Bear Market?

**Investing**

When Bitcoin reached its price peak in 2021, many traders thought with chagrin, “I should have bought.” Now, when the market is in a bearish phase, there is an excellent opportunity to buy tokens of various crypto projects. The “buy the dip” strategy is among the most popular for many investors. For some, this “rule” is even the principal investment strategy. The expression “Buy the Dip” has a weighty justification — the market is constantly growing. With rare exceptions (both by assets and by periods), it is. Investing more when the price decreases will be advisable if any asset has a steady uptrend. Treat it like a discount purchase. However, it is not necessary to buy up all the assets.

* Invest in reliable, time-tested projects that have a solid foundation. For example, Bitcoin, which is an indicator of the market, has a robust community, is massively used as a means of payment, and so on. Or Ethereum, which is already the most popular platform for launching Dapps, and with the launch of Ethereum 2.0, considerable increases in price are possible.
* Study the project team, the level of execution of goals provided in the roadmap, and long-term plans. How accurately developers adhere to their plans is one of the indicators of success. In addition, analyze whether the project has enough funds to survive the bear market. Study tokenomics, the prices of private and seed rounds, and the token release schedule.
* Invest in tokens of projects produced in trending directions. Study profitable areas that accumulate large amounts of money. For example, GameFi applications are becoming more and more popular.

There is a crucial detail in the “buy the dip” strategy. It is not worth investing all the funds at once because we are never exactly sure when the price will push off and go up. Therefore, we recommend using the DCA strategy (dollar-cost averaging). DCA involves gradually entering the asset, namely purchasing equal parts with a specific frequency. This means that instead of depositing all the funds into the asset in one payment, you divide them into several pieces and invest them in the asset according to a specific schedule.

Let’s say we have $1000 and assume that the bearish trend will last about a year. We divide our $1000 by the number of weeks per year and invest about $20 weekly in the desired asset.

As a result, our investments will have a long-term character during the bear market, which should allow us not to miss the moment of the beginning of an uptrend and reduce the risks when entering an asset during a downtrend at the same time.

**Short-selling**

Short-selling is a classic strategy of bears, i.e., traders who want to make money on price reduction. The bear purchases a crypto asset on credit, pays a commission and interest on this loan and disposes of the funds received at its discretion. For example, Bob borrows an asset from the exchange and sells it at the current price of $2000. After a week, the asset drops by 20%, Bob buys the asset for $1600 and returns it to the exchange with interest (for example, $5) and commission (for example, $2). The remaining $393 is his profit. Within the framework of crypto exchanges, two tools allow traders to short-sell cryptocurrency:

* Margin trading. The essence of this method is the ability to borrow assets from an exchange/broker and make more expensive transactions. Accordingly, margin trading makes it possible to earn more on transactions.
* Futures is a contract between two bidders to buy/sell a certain asset at a certain time at a price specified in the contract. Futures contracts are divided by delivery dates into quarterly and perpetual futures contracts.

Margin and futures trading allows you to increase profits by using leverage.

**Deposits**

Crypto exchanges strive to have as many users as possible place their funds with them. This allows exchanges to increase liquidity and use cryptocurrency for other purposes. In addition, during the bear market period, users can earn income and not just leave their assets out of work.

Deposits come with a fixed or floating interest rate. In return, users receive a portion of the crypto exchange’s income — the principle is the same as that of banks.

The yield is constantly changing for floating-rate deposits and can be higher and lower compared to fixed-rate deposits. However, the latter has one caveat — interest is accrued only after the end of the selected period, but the longer the period, the higher the yield.

**Lending**

Lending implies a relatively high income, from 12-15% APR. Depending on the exchange, the lending percentage can be set independently, and loans can be provided at a fixed rate.

There are centralized lending platforms (Nexo, Crypto.com) and decentralized (Maker, Compound, Aave).

Decentralized financial platforms (DeFi) are considered more secure, but their interest rates are lower than those of centralized ones. Therefore, using DeFi to take out cheap loans and then provide them at higher rates on centralized sites is advantageous.

**Farming (liquidity mining)**

Farming is a new form of income generation in cryptocurrency, which came to us from DeFi.

Liquidity mining means that investors act as liquidity providers (LP). They supply liquidity to the platforms and earn a portion of exchanges trading fees. For their support, they also receive LP tokens that can be used to generate passive income.

As in the case of loans, the yield varies depending on the total volume of the liquidity pool. The farming process is practically the same as lending, but with one caveat: not a separate cryptocurrency is added to the liquidity pool, but a pair. For example, ETH and USDT. Therefore, both cryptocurrencies should be on the wallet balance.

**Staking**

Staking (Proof of Stake) is an energy-efficient alternative to mining (Proof of Work). From the investor’s point of view, staking is an opportunity to place your savings in a bank (protocol) via a crypto wallet to receive a fixed income over time. For this, holders receive remuneration from the network up to 36% APR. In addition, this approach encourages investors to keep cryptocurrency as long as possible, which positively affects the exchange rate dynamics.

Two ways to stake cryptocurrency are by launching your node or delegating coins to validators.

The first method requires technical knowledge and is suitable only for those with a large amount to invest. But this way, you can increase profitability because other participants can vote for your node.

The second way is delegation. You do not need to install a node. It is enough to delegate coins to the network validators.

In addition to traditional staking, criticized due to the lack of liquidity, the DeFi sector allows us to get the most out of our tokens — liquid staking. With liquid staking, users can receive both staking rewards and any rewards received for using their tokens in DeFi apps. In fact, Liquid Staking provides a representative L-token in the same proportion as the user’s original token in exchange for placing its tokens in the corresponding protocol.

Thus, if you place an ATOM bet in the Persistence Protocol, you will receive a pATOM token in a proportion equivalent to the deposited ATOM assets. You can use these pATOM tokens in any DeFi protocol to generate more profit.

**Airdrop**

An airdrop is a wonderful tool that helps traders get tokens of various projects for free. During bear market periods, airdrops are a kind of bonus. Tokens of successful projects can significantly increase in price, which will help to cover the current losses somehow. Airdrops come in several types:

* Retroactive airdrop. The best and most exclusive type of drops in the entire field of cryptocurrencies, to get it, it is necessary to fulfill the conditions that the project lays out. For example, the airdrop of UNI tokens was conducted among users who used the Uniswap exchange at least once.
* Bounty airdrop. As part of the bounty program, the project lays out the conditions for participation in the program: subscribe to their social media, write about the project on your social media.
* Exclusive airdrop. Exclusive airdrops are usually given to those who supported the project in the early stages.
* Airdrop per hold. Also, projects carry out airdrops among those who keep a specific coin in their wallet.

The rest of the money is going into a new deck on the front of our house ( ours is littlery falling apart ) and a garage for me so my wife can have her laundry room.
We could take more but I don't know what interest rates are going to do in 3 years.

investing,60/40 portfolio viability in the future?,"I've been thinking about the market downturn this year and how quickly it has hit basically all asset classes including bonds, which have had their worst year in decades due to inflation and interest rate hikes.

Prior to this year a common conclusion in recent research from firms like Vanguard, JP Morgan, et. al is that the 60/40 would have anemic returns over the next decade due to high equity and bond prices combined with historically low yields.

2022 has definitely started out that way sure.  Bonds have provided little protection during a time of high inflation and rising interest rates.

However I am wondering if, once inflation peaks (whenever that may be), the current drawdown in the 60/40 has actually improved the outlook for expected returns in the future on this portfolio allocation compared to what much of the research on this was forecasting just a year or two ago.  Obviously this hinges a lot on what happens with inflation, rate hikes, earnings, etc. over the next year or so.

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Thursday as traders assess the possibility of even tighter U.S. monetary policy on the back of a hot inflation report. Traders also pored over key quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed 481 points, or 1.56%. S&amp;P 500 futures were 1.49% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.13%.
*****
&gt; Futures added to their losses after JPMorgan Chase reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. The stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading. Morgan Stanley is also set to report Thursday.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index rose 9.1% on the year in June, higher than a Dow Jones estimate for an 8.8% year-over-year increase. Core CPI, which excludes volatile prices of food and energy, was 5.9%, also ahead of a 5.7% estimate.
*****
&gt; In addition, the Beige Book, released Wednesday by the Fed showed worries of an upcoming recession amid high inflation.
*****
&gt; The CPI report also impacted treasuries, sending the 2-year Treasury yield up nine basis points to about 3.138% while the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell about 4 basis points to 2.919. An inversion of the two is a popular signal of a recession.
*****
&gt; The report also opened the door for a big Federal Reserve rate increase later this month, with the fed funds futures market now pricing in a hike of as much as 1% — or 100 basis points.
*****
&gt; “The takeaway for investors is that Fed policy remains data-dependent and the central bank will continue on an aggressive tightening path until inflationary pressures peak decisively,” strategists at BCA Research wrote in a note. “Persistent price pressures call for another jumbo hike at the July 26-27 FOMC, but there is still room for the data to improve before the September meeting, 8 weeks later.”
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims and the June producer price index report, which measures prices paid to producers of goods and services, will also be released Thursday. Both reports will give further insight into the economy.

CryptoCurrency,"XRP news abound this week! Former Ripple chair Barr Confirmed as new Fed Chief, Judge Netburn named the SEC 'hypocrites' in ruling, McCaleb (XLM) dumping nearly done. Whew!","My goodness friends, what a week for Ripple. XRP holders, catalysts abound yet we remain stuck in by the bears. Let's do a quick recap anyway, and hope that the market begins to reflect the bullish news:

Michael Barr Confirmed: Michael Barr, a former Ripple adviser, is set to assume one of the most important U.S. regulatory roles after winning Senate confirmation to be vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Barr is considered an ally to crypto, but has tempered his sentiments with expectations that the market be regulated robustly. This appointment is widely considered good for crypto, and considering it's issues with the SEC - good for Ripple.

Netburn says 'the Hinman emails must be produced': The long awaited ruling has finally come down from Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn regarding the attorney-client privilege of conversations had with SEC lawyers by William Hinman. Judge Netburn unequivocally ruled in favor of Ripple, even slamming the 'hypocrisy' of the SEC in its attempted defense - asserting that the SEC isn't even attempting to follow the law in good faith. In his now infamous speech Hinman said that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not to be considered securities, despite ETH having conducted the same kind of unregistered token offerings as Ripple. The preperatory emails Hinman exchanged with SEC lawyers have been desperately guarded to this point, and it remains to be seen what the SEC will do. It seems likely that there will be a series of appeals to Judge Analise Torres, who is responsible for ruling on any appeals to Judge Netburn's decisions.

Jed's dead baby: Former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb is almost done selling his 9 billion XRP after nearly 8 years. Jed left Ripple after having differences with the leadership team on the direction of the project there. Jed has since worked to bring Stellar (XLM) into the crypto space as a competitor to Ripple within the global payment settlement industry. It is believed that Jed has nearly completed selling his stack of XRP, (he holds approximately 10 million in his TacoStand account) which is estimated to be gone by weeks end. XRP fans are ecstatic about this, as the downward selling pressure has been significant from McCaleb for nearly a decade.

Other notes: Did you know that Ripple only controls about 5% of nodes on the XRPL? XRP is more decentralized than many crypto projects. The community drives most innovations on chain as well, and will soon deliver Smart Contracts to XRPL in a 100% community driven effort, minus any Ripple devs. Congrats!

Much to be excited for if you hold a bag of XRP. Thanks for reading!",cryptocurrency,1657802262

investing,High inflation may never going away. Reasons why below. And why it will be worse outside of America,"Fertilizer limitations on a global scale. 

China - bans exports of Phosphate
Russia - can't export Potash
Europe - Nitrogen = Nat gas sky high price. 

Input costs alone will cripple Europe and Asia. First, by making food more expensive, as well as making land less productive as smaller farms skimp on fertilizer. Spiraling food shortages will produce famine first in Sub Saharan Africa and then Asia. 

Agricultural Wheat

Wheat - Russia Largest producer in the world.
Ukraine 4th Largest producer in the world. 

Russia is in the process of systematically destroying the farmland in Ukraine. This will have LONG lasting production consequences. 

Food costs rise. Again, famine first in Africa, then Asia if they don't import Russia wheat. 

Boomers Retire.

Global labor Shortage. 

Zoomer Smallest Generation cannot replace them. 

2022 = 400k shortage. Labor costs go UP. Keeping inflation running for years. 

2034 = 900k shortage.  This is mathematics. Not speculation.

Europe has less Gen Z and Millennials to replace Boomers. So they're lives are going to be hit hardest with recession and stagflation. 

China and Russia are screwed because of total population collapse. 

US consumer has 2 trillion in savings. That's a LOT of demand. 

Two ways to lower inflation:

Suppress Demand/ Increase Supply

Fed cannot raise rates fast enough. But demand continues. 

Supply MUST increase, but how with lower workforce? 


Dollar Denominated Commodities

Oil .Nat Gas , Food.
Fertilzer. Iron ore, Boxite

Finished metals

all are denominated in Dollars.

Any leftover money I put into savings. I’m hoping eventually to get a house. Also I would like to get a cat or dog but I can’t right now because my roommate has a cat.

My roommate and I’s lease expires soon. I think she might want to move out so I’ve been looking into my own places. 

I really like our current place so im thinking of getting a 1 bedroom here. Within walking distance of a couple grocery stores, the library, the bank, the gas station, nice trails, quiet neighborhood, 5 min to work. Private garage. Pet friendly. However it would be roughly the same I’m paying right now or a little more ($100 more).

For the same, if I moved 10-15 minutes further away (so roughly 20 min to work) I could get a two bedroom apartment on my own or if my roommate and I stayed together, we could move somewhere cheaper and split a $1100 place instead.  I’ve also thought about renting a house but idk about maintenance.

What is the most I can afford? Would it be better to get a 1 bedroom on my own or two? Should I look for a cheaper place?

Not great but the lender says that's not a huge problem). Her name will be on the title because that's the requirement of the HOA for this 55+ community.

Sale price is $212,000; loan amount is $159,000; we're putting $60k down. Interest rate is 5.5% for a total monthly payment of $1,400 (including HOA costs).

The monthly payment is still a little too high for her so my brother is pitching in $200 a month. She says she'll be able to pay the rest, but I'm planning to pick up any potential shortfalls or repair costs to the unit. She's not reliable financially so I need to be prepared for that.

That all said, what are the tax implications of all this? Should I try to get her name on the mortgage, so her payment isn't considered taxable income? Or are there other deductions for renting an investment property out to a family member, especially at a lower market rate?

However, I found a gem in the form of an interview published a month ago with Seema Shah, Principal Global Investors' chief global strategist.

Interview here: https://www.investopedia.com/the-express-podcast-episode-90-5409520

Here are some notable quotes regarding Seema's opinion on inflation and interest rate hikes:

""It's a really important thing that we're talking about at the moment, because what I'm finding is investors are taking a lot of comfort from the current strength of the economy, but they're ignoring the monetary policy. It typically works with a six-to-24-month lag. So, whatever happened today with the Fed is not going to be showing up in the economy for several months, several quarters, still.""

""But we also look at consumer spending. That is particularly strong and that has been held up by the cushion of excess savings provided during the COVID crisis. We look at the labor market, unemployment rate close to the pre-COVID lows, and extremely tight, really, really strong labor demand. But you fast forward 12 months from now, and consumers are going to be struggling because time and inflation is going to eat away at a lot of that excess savings, especially for your lower-wealth thresholds of the economy. You look at the labor market, and so many companies are struggling with the margin pressures from higher costs. And you can start to see that temporary help, which is usually your main leading indicator for the labor market, is starting to decline. So, 12 months from now into 2023, things are going to look very different from a number of economic indicators.""

""So, the thing that seems to come up in every single conversation that we have with them, which it is absolutely right to be questioning this, is in this inflationary environment when you know that the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world are going to be hiking really aggressively, how on Earth can markets continue to outperform? Is this the time to go in cash, or is there any opportunity within the market? And look, it's really important... this is not the time to cash out. This is the time to become more clever with your investing. So, more selectivity and more understanding of where you are allocating. Because we can't hide away from this. Things are going to get tougher.""

They go for about 400,000 and above where I live. Condos and town homes go for about 190,000 to low 300,000s. I make a decent wage and can put a 3% down payment I think. I pay about 1800 in rent right now for a 1 bedroom apartment. Looking at Zillow my mortgage payment with all fees including HOA would be bout 1800 to 2200 for a condo or town home so not an enormous difference and I’d rather build equity and own my place. 


I recent moved to a new city because my last city the home prices were insane like condos were starting at 500,000 and houses in the 700,000. I’m getting older and I really want to own my place and call it my home. Maybe in 5 years I can sell it I can get into a better place but that’s 5 years or paying rent. But even still i don’t think I’d mind being in a condo or townhouse. Apartment living I imagine is similar and I’m ok with that. And I hate hard work and don’t want to maintain a lawn ya know. So I could see myself being in it longer than 5 years.

personalfinance,Husband and I are about to earn a substantially higher income. I want to make sure we're making the right moves.,"Hey team. Using a throwaway cause I'm gonna be sharing some more personal financial info.

Husband and I have been married for about 10.5 years. Through that entire time, at least one of us has been a full time student. He just finished a PhD program in a field that can earn him a pretty significant starting salary (around 150k). I currently make just under 70k, and I'm looking for jobs that will push me a bit higher.

We're not in a great spot financially, and I want to make sure that we do the right things with our money. Here's where we're at:

# Debt

For a number of years, our combined gross income was around 30-40k (when we were both full time students). During that time, we maxed out a few credit cards and lines of credit. And then we took out personal loans which have super high interest rates due to our credit scores being so bad owing to high credit utilization. Given that we have 6 college degrees between the two of us, we're lucky that we don't have a massive student loan burden since we had a number of scholarships and fellowships. 

In all, we have about $1000 in credit card debt, $1,500 in line of credit debt, $17,500 in personal loan debt, $40,000 in student loan debt, and $20,000 in debt owed to family. Yikes, I know.

# Savings

We have exactly $0 in savings. Zip. Nada. This is a big problem because when there's an emergency, it just adds to our debt.

# Investing

Beyond what my work takes out of my paycheck for retirement investing, we have no investments. To be completely honest, the world of investing feels so beyond me. I have no idea how to determine what is and isn't a good investment, what kinds of things to invest in, how to invest, etc. Added to that is the fact that we want to be responsible about ethical investing and we don't want to invest in companies that have private defense contracts, private prisons, etc. 

# Spending

I don't have a great history of responsible spending. I have definitely gotten waaay better over time, but I'm not where I want to be. I've had to do a lot of introspective work and reflection on why I spend, how spending makes me feel, what kinds of emotional holes I try to fill with spending, etc. But I also know that lifestyle creep is real, and I definitely have some anxiety about the possibility that more income = more money for me to spend, ya know? Side note: about a year ago I found the youtube channel for The Financial Diet, and their content has helped me a ton on this front.

# Home

We rent, and honestly, owning a home seems like an impossibility. The median home price in our county is $544k. I'd love to be able to buy a home one day. We aren't able to move to a different/more affordable part of the country for a number of reasons. Is it bad that I'm kind of hoping our savings align with a housing market crash so that we can afford something?

personalfinance,How to clear your Credit Card debit,"1 Focus on a single loan at a time 
Have you have any credit cards with balances? In that case, be sure to always pay the minimum amount due on each card. After that, concentrate on reducing the amount on each card one at a time. There are two options for selecting which card to target: 

Concentrate on high-interest debt 
Determine which credit card has the highest interest rate by looking at the interest rate portion of your accounts, and then focus on eliminating that debt first. 
OR 

Utilize the snowball approach 
You pay off the card with the lowest balance first when using the snowball approach. Once the sum is paid in full, you use the funds you were using to pay down that debt to assist with the next smallest balance.

2 Spend over the minimum 
Check the statement on your credit card. It takes much longer to pay off your credit card payment if you only pay the minimum balance. You'll pay less interest altogether if you pay more than the minimum. In order for you to understand how this relates to your account, your card company must chart this information out on your statement. 

a brief tip 
If you can, pay a little bit more each month. Every additional dollar you pay goes toward your amount, and the lower your balance, the less interest you will have to pay. 

3 Debt consolidation 
Debt consolidation enables you to consolidate many balances with higher interest rates into one with a cheaper rate, allowing you to pay off your debt faster:

Transferring funds 
Utilize a low balance transfer rate to get debt off of high-interest credit cards. Be mindful that balance transfer costs, which are frequently between 3 and 5 percent, may frequently outweigh the savings from the lower interest rate. Always take that into account when evaluating this choice. 

Draw on the equity in your home 
You might be able to pay off your credit card debt using any equity you have in your home. A home equity line of credit can provide a rate that is lower than what your credit cards do. Keep in mind that closing expenses frequently apply. 
If you decide to combine, bear in mind that it's critical to manage your expenditures to prevent accruing further debt.

4 Analyze your expenses. 
Organize your monthly expenses into categories, such as grocery, transportation, housing, and entertainment. A useful resource is your credit card statement because many issuers categorize your purchases. Search for areas where you can make savings. After that, use the extra cash to start paying down your debt. 

 Paid in cash 
Consider making cash purchases as a means of managing your overall debt. You can prevent overspending and impulsive purchases by paying with cash or a debit card. You also avoid any additional fees that might be assessed when using a credit or debit card. Additionally, you'll be able to compare the amount coming in and going out each week or month with clarity.

Review your spending
Start by categorizing your monthly spending, for example: groceries, transportation, housing and entertainment. Your credit card statement can be a helpful tool; many issuers categorize your spending. Look for areas where you can cut back. Then take the money you’ve freed up and apply it to paying down your debt.

Pay with cash
One way to manage your overall debt is to consider purchasing things with cash. Using cash or a debit card can help you avoid overspending or making impulse purchases—plus you eliminate any extra fees that may apply when paying with plastic. You’ll also have a clear understanding of how much is going out vs. coming in every week or month.

Make use of financial windfalls 
Pay down your debt with raises, bonuses, and other financial windfalls rather than adding them to your monthly spending budget. You can accelerate your debt repayment by using this ""extra"" cash to make small payments on your debt.",finance,1657830460

personalfinance,Completely overwhelmed and not sure which professional I need.,"I have around $12k in credit card debt (a lot of that being accrued interest from a few cards with high rates). I had a personal issue and car troubles come up, which totally depleted my savings (only make $40k per year) and I couldn’t afford the payments anymore.

I had stopped spending a while ago, but everything was mostly maxed out because I was being irresponsible. I didn’t splurge a lot, I just didn’t realize that a dinner here and there and buying a new TV would put me in a precarious situation. I have written down all my bills and understand my financial situation a lot more now. However, it doesn’t help me pay off these cards and I’m so overwhelmed.

Some of the cc accounts have gone to debt collectors, others I still have open and am on a payment plan (of which I’m still missing payments because I just don’t make enough at my job). I need to figure out if I should go for a debt management plan and try to consolidate, or pay off the collectors with these high interest rates. And if I do anything, what should I pay off first/where do I put the money I do have?

What kind of professional do I need? A financial planner? A debt counselor? I’ve tried to contact my credit union for help but they had no services besides opening a cc and doing a balance transfer or personal loan (which I won’t qualify for since my credit is terrible). I appreciate any advice on where to go from here.",finance,1657837975
personalfinance,What to do with proceeds from selling car?,"Now that my husband and I are both working from home full time and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, we decided it was a good idea to sell one of our vehicles. We rarely used it, and with the hot used car market, we were able to get almost the same price we paid for it 4 years ago. So now we have $12,000 in cash with no immediate plans to spend it, so we’re trying to decide the best use of that money.

We have no debt (except a mortgage with a low interest rate), and a 6 month emergency fund in an easily accessible account. Our remaining vehicle is paid off.

Like I said, we don’t have any immediate large expenses coming up, but I could see us deciding in the next 2-3 years to do a home remodel project we’ve been discussing. We figured we would finance it with a home equity loan, but obviously it would be nice to put that $12,000 towards it. So we might want to keep the money somewhat accessible. On the other hand, I could also see us kicking the can down the road and not doing the remodel, so I’d hate to just leave the money sitting around for an eventuality that never comes.

I have a Roth IRA that we could invest the money in, or a money market account. CDs and treasury bonds are other options I saw that might be good for short term investing, but I just really don’t know. Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1657838105

stocks,VERU is brewing up a perfect storm with the upcoming EUA,"This post is about the upcoming EUA for VERU Sabizabulin which has proven remarkably effective in treating hospitalized COVID patients.

Phase III trial was so effective that the FDA has issued an early approval and considered the trial a success. Source: ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancer-drug-sabizabulin-covid-19/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancer-drug-sabizabulin-covid-19/))

Now, I know exactly what you are thinking: isn't COVID pretty much gone these days?

The answer is: absolutely NOT.

**The Fundamentals (aka Gasoline):**

Hospitalizations for COVID are on the rise since May with the new and improved Omincron strain (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/covid-hospitalizations-have-doubled-since-may-as-omicron-bapoint5-sweeps-us-but-deaths-remain-low.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/covid-hospitalizations-have-doubled-since-may-as-omicron-bapoint5-sweeps-us-but-deaths-remain-low.html)) and while deaths are still low compared with the chaos of 2021, COVID is still a huge threat that should be taken seriously by everyone and especially by the elderly and overweight.

Hospitalizations will continue to rise as air conditioning usage goes into overdrive and with the 0% probability of the country shutting down again and/or requesting mandatory mask use. Mandated mask use at a federal level has 0% of making a comeback with the midterm elections looming large.

Come hell or high water the country will stay open and COVID hospitalizations will continue to increase throughout the summer.

And what does this mean to VERU? At this point the approval of Sabizabulin to treat COVID hospitalizations is a done deal. The main question is: will it classify for an EUA and if so, what is the size of the contract i.e. guaranteed revenue?

**The Rag soaked in Kerosene:**

If previous history is to be considered, EUA contracts for COVID meds that were FAR less effective than Sabizabulin (and with additional side effects) have been in the ball park of $5-$10 BILLION. That's Billion with a B and even the low end of the range is around 5x the current marketcap of VERU. 

**The High Octane Lighter Fluid:**

As if the fundamentals were not strong enough, there is another aspect that makes VERU a very interesting prospect and that is Short Selling. As I write this post, VERU is currently short by about 20M shares (source: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=veru](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=veru)).

When you consider insider ownership of around 20%, the 20M represents roughly 31% of the entire circulation. And that's the most conservative estimate. Fintel and Ortex, for example, have it at close to 50% short of float. Funding rates (i.e. interest you must pay to short the stock) are starting to rise and in the (very likely) event of an EUA, it will a race to cover positions. 

**The Match:**

The FDA is expected to respond to VERU requests for EUA by August 5th. Note that they can respond at anytime before then, that is simply the deadline. I expect a positive response based on the feedback of Phase 3 trial. Once the news trickle down of how much more effective Sabizabulin is versus other regular options like Tamiflu, the stock will further rally into strength propelled by high octane short covering.

I welcome any thoughts on this thesis, especially critical ones 👍

TLDR: $1B marketcap Biotech company with a very likely EUA approval for a much more efficient COVID medication is currently sitting on a perfect storm of short selling and fast increasing COVID hospitalizations in a country that will NOT go back to shutdowns no matter what.

solar,Gut check? Seems too good,"Wife and I have been watching our electrical bill climb as summer rages on and she started researching solar. Let me see if I've got this right:

* 14 kWh system with 20.5% efficiency rating, 38 panels
* $36k system cash cost, or $54k if we use their in house low APR financing (which we won't)
* We'll get our own financing @ 3.99% 25-year, $234/mo note
* Our current electrical demand is \~$259/mo
* $9.5k fed tax credit if completed before EOY 2022
* Solar increases home value by 3-4%
* The house is worth \~$900k making the system worth $27k-$36k

So we net $26/mo savings and $9.5k cash (as tax credit) at tax time and the system increases the value of the home by more than we pay. So even if we move out next year, we've saved $312 versus utility bills ($26/mo for a year), we've gotten $9.5k tax credit, and increased the house value by $27k. Even if we pay off the $36k loan in cash (or have it transferred at closing for a seller credit), we're able to completely cover that with the at least $37k (assuming the system increases home value by the ""low"" end 3% aka $27k + $9.5k tax credit +$312) in equivalent value from the system, tax credits and savings.

Seems to good to be true. What facts or math do I have wrong, and/or what am I missing?

Forex,Where next for EUR/USD?,"After hitting parity on Tuesday, EUR/USD has since breached this level twice in the last two days. The pair has managed to hold above 1.000 on a closing basis, but near-term direction will likely depend on upcoming central bank meetings and economic outlook.

The series of lower lows in the past few days may be an indication that demand at this key psychological support is waning. The ECB is expected to begin their tightening cycle this month, but another hot US CPI print has now put the possibility of a 100bps hike from the Fed firmly on the table. Combined with the Eurozone’s slowing economy, this could be the final push needed to take EUR/USD on a sustained leg lower. 

However, the US economy isn’t in a particularly strong position itself, with data telling a similar story to that in the EU. Although the Fed is in a stronger position than the ECB in terms of stimulating the economy when needed, the forex market doesn’t seem to be pricing in a potential US recession. Given that the greenback has been on such an impressive run, a change in sentiment could trigger heavy profit-taking, and in turn, help EUR/USD bounce.  

Of course, all trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see if the pair bottoms out at this important level, or if there is still room to fall.",finance,1657866764

devops,Importing google workspace users and groups to LDAP/AD server,"EDIT: for those suggesting to just buy it - there is no budget to buy the extra features of GC, I am aware that thi would be the best solution to my issue, however it is not an option.

Hello, I hope this is not too OPS focused for this subreddit, but this something my Devops team has to solve. Let me decribe the situation - I have inherited a situation with around 150 users, some 100 of those are developers. User identities are spread across multiple providers or even systems specific local accounts being used and I want to fix that and have one source - Google workspace as a main identity. The onboarding and offboarding is a mess here, lot of shadow accounts everywhere. The origin of this issue is that GC does not support LDAP, only Oauth in the standard version. Buying LDAP feature will be too expensive for CTO to approve, like 10k a year just for this feature. Some systems in place here support only LDAP - Nexus repository as an example. My idea is to federate GCP and some AD mutation, either AzureAD, open LDAP, or even windows server with ADFS. I would like to solve this by importing the GCP users and groups to AD and then point the necessary systems to use AD as the authentication provider. Everything will be managed from GCP, the AD will be kind of ""read only"" copy. I struggle to find resources for this setup, everyone just describes the other way - going from AD to google... I am wondering if anyone already done this and if this is even possible.",technology,1657878888
personalfinance,$20K in checking. Weird lifestyle + work life + variable income = need advice.,"Hey Reddit peoples,

I've seen a bunch of great advice given on this sub so I figured I'd toss my hat in the ring and see what you guys recommend:

**Me:**

40. Male. American. Single. No kids. No dependents. Healthy.

**Work:**

International humanitarian aid worker most of the time. When I'm not abroad, sometimes a disaster risk / response consultant in the US.

**Income:**

Primary income (international humanitarian work) = low salary on paper (\~2.7K a month after taxes) but in practice quite nice since I have no real traditional living expenses given that is covered by my organization when I'm working abroad - food, housing, transport, flights, etc. + a per diem. So what I get paid is what stays in my bank account. All I have to cover is my required vacations (5 days every 3 months) and I can do these very cheap if need be. Average length of time in this job per year = 6 to 9 months.

Consulting income = highly variable. $50+/hr. but can be FT or 5 hours a week, depending on the gig. Very tricky to give a ""normal"" income for this. In 2020 about $55K (pre-tax). In 2021, $13K (pre-tax). Totally dependent on my availability and the contracts we get and I am chosen to work on.

**Relevant Financial Info:**

Good credit score (\~800).

$65K in student loan debt on a federal Pay-As-You-Earn program, for an MA in 2012 - 2013. Usually less than $200/mo. when not frozen like it has been due to COVID, due to my low income on paper. I am registered in Public Service Loan Forgiveness but still have a ways off for that. Have been hesitant to aggressively pay off the debt given possible student loan forgiveness initiatives that are being discussed, and the fact that if I stay in humanitarian work, I would end of paying much less if I just stick with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness or my salary stays somewhat the same give my Pay-As-You-Earn payments.

No other debt.

Health insurance provided by my primary employer. When in-between assignments, I qualify for subsidized programs given my income on paper. Normally no more than $200/mo., and only for a few months a year, if that.

$20K in a checking account. \~$9K in crypto that I basically forget I have. Bought back in 2017 so even if it goes to zero I stand to lose only a few grand, so I don't stress it. \~3$K in old 401k accounts I forgot about until checking them recently.

Do not own a home. Have a free place to live when I'm in-between humanitarian work placements, or I tend to live very cheap (camping, affordable countries, etc.) if I decide to move around.

**Questions:**

What recommendations do you have for me in respects to my current and future cash holdings? My bank account goes up by about $2.5K a month when I'm working my primary job, so having it just sitting in checking has to be a rather stupid use of it. FWIW liquidity is important for me, even if I have access to largish credit lines via my cards.

Recommendations in respects to the student loan debt?

401k / other retirement savings programs - worth it? My employer matches. That said, likely I may not retire in the US, and given the somewhat risky nature of my work (often working in war zones / high security risk zones) I sometimes feel funny saving for old age given the higher likelihood of death in my profession, and the increasing numbers of aid workers killed. That said, the overwhelming majority of us don't die doing the work, and being broke when I'm old sounds pretty crap.

Any other obvious things I could be doing better with my $$$?

**Random Info:**

I live a pretty non-traditional life. I could very happily do the van life thing for a while, or car-camp, or Airbnb / cheap hotel hop in affordable places. I have no big ""goal"" I'm saving for. Like the idea of buying a plot of land somewhere and building a modest home maybe at some point, but not committed to it, and definitely not committed to that being in the US. All of this to say I don't mind living a bit ""loose"" but I do value being smart and efficient with how I manage my cash so as to keep myself flexible and not stressed. I've been in crushing debt before living as an under-earning renter in VERY expensive cities (SF, NYC, London) and I dug myself out of that (twice) and never want to go back. For me, cash = freedom + peace of mind. And a nice pair of boots.

the only downside i see to this is that if you get into no accident at all, and payoff your car through the life of its loan term, you paid a bit more on due to gap insurance, and more from the loans interest rate hitting the full value.

**Rogers CEO apologizes for massive service outage, blames maintenance update**  
A massive network outage at Rogers Communications that shut down mobile and internet services across much of Canada on Friday was not a cyberattack, but was instead what Rogers president and CEO Tony Staffieri described as “a network system failure following a maintenance update in our core network, which caused some of our routers to malfunction.” With many businesses, government agencies and parts of the 911 emergency service rendered powerless during the 15-hour outage, experts are calling this a “learning opportunity for threat actors such as Russian state-sponsored hackers, who can now see how vulnerable Canadian industry, financial institutions and health-care systems are to an attack on a telecom provider.”

**Medical debt collection firm says ransomware attack exposed info on 650+ healthcare orgs**  
In a statement issued late last week, Professional Finance Company said that during the February attack the Quantum ransomware group used the Bumblebee malware loader to gain access to databases that held names, addresses, accounts receivable balances, information regarding payments made to accounts, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and health insurance data and medical treatment information. Its role as a debt collection firm means healthcare organizations provide the company with information on patients or customers who have not paid, making them an ideal target for hackers. PFC said it notified the 657 companies in May.

**Government contractor pays $9 million over whistleblower allegations**  
Aerojet Rocketdyne, who is a rocket contractor for the likes of the DoD and NASA, has paid a $9 million settlement for misrepresenting its compliance with US government security requirements. Brian Markus, former senior director of cybersecurity at Aerojet, alleged the company lied about its cybersecurity policies to win more contracts, adding that the company experienced data breaches in 2014 and 2015. Markus filed the claim under the DoJ’s False Claims Act Civil Cyber Defense Initiative, launched in October last year. This was the first case in which a former employee attempted to bring action on a government’s behalf for alleged cybersecurity fraud. Under the False Claims Act’s whistleblower provisions, Markus will receive $2.1 million of the settlement.

**FTC is cracking down on false claims of anonymizing data**  
On Tuesday, the FTC warned tech companies against making deceptive data-anonymization claims. The FTC is especially focused on companies collecting user location information and passing it off to third parties. Acting associate director for the commission’s privacy division, Kristin Cohen, said, “Significant research has shown that ‘anonymized’ data can often be re-identified, especially in the context of location data.” The FTC’s warning follows President Biden’s executive order which urges the FTC to protect the privacy of consumers’ seeking out reproductive health services. The FTC is prepared to sue offenders, which could result in a US court imposing civil penalties.

**Microsoft warns of massive phishing operation**  
The company warned of a massive series of phishing attacks targeting over 10,000 organizations since September 2021. These attacks use landing pages designed to spoof the Office online authentication page, stealing credentials and session cookies even for users using multifactor authentication. These are then used to access mailboxes for business email compromise attacks. Microsoft suggests organizations implement MFA with certificate-based authentication and FIDO 2.0 support to mitigate this scheme. It maintained that while some implementations of MFA are vulnerable to these phishing approaches, it should remain “an essential pillar in identity security.”

**Callback phishing scams impersonate security companies**  
A new report from the legitimate cybersecurity company CrowdStrike detailed a callback phishing campaign with threat actors impersonating CrowdStrike. Over the past year, the actors would leave messages with companies claiming to be from the security vendors, asking them to call back to resolve a problem or cancel a subscription. Once an organization calls back, the attackers use social engineering to get them to install remote access software. In an update to the campaign, the attackers warn recipients of malicious network intruders compromising workstations, requiring an in-depth security audit that requires access to the device. From there the attackers walk through the employee installing a remote access trojan. CrowdStrike believes the ultimate intention is to launch ransomware on these organizations, and shows ties to the Quantum ransomware gang.

Joshua Schulte, was arrested after the 2017 disclosure by WikiLeaks of a trove of confidential documents detailing the agency’s secret methods for penetrating the computer networks of foreign governments and terrorists. The document dump included instructions for compromising various commonly used computer tools, and then using them to spy: the online calling service Skype; Wi-Fi networks; PDF documents; and even commercial antivirus programs of the kind used by millions of people to protect their computers. The breach, known as the Vault 7 leak, caused “catastrophic” damage to national security, the government said.

It could take a decade to fully eradicate Log4j from some computer systems, a Department of Homeland Security review board said Thursday. The review board, which the White House established last year to investigate major cybersecurity incidents, called on the government and the private sector to invest much more in securing the open-source software that underpins global IT infrastructure. But while there were reports of ransomware gangs and governments from China to Turkey exploiting the software vulnerability, the high-impact hacks that some analysts anticipated have yet to materialize, the DHS-backed panel wrote.

&amp;#x200B;

The latest consumer price index data this week revealed a searing 9.1% increase year over year in June, prompting Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to say that inflation in the U.S. is ""unacceptably high.""

The causes behind the steep jumps include high energy prices, pandemic stimulus spending and geopolitical crises — but one investor is blaming millennials.

 Smead explained that in the U.S. there are an estimated 92 million millennials, primarily in the 27- to 42-year-old age bracket. ""The last time we saw what we call 'wolverine inflation' — which is inflation that is hard for policymakers to stop — was when 75 million baby boomers had replaced 44 million silent generation people in the 1970s."" 

 ""See, what everyone is not including in the conversation is what really causes inflation, which is too many people with too much money chasing too few goods,"" Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.  

 ""So we have in the United States a whole lot of people, (aged) 27 to 42, who postponed homebuying, car buying, for about seven years later than most generations,"" he said. 

""But in the past two years they've all entered the party together, and this is just the beginning of a 10-to-12-year time period where there's about 50% more people that are wanting these things than there were in the prior group.""

""So the Fed can tighten credit, but it won't reduce the number of people wanting these necessities in comparison to the prior group,"" Smead said.

As the Fed pumped the U.S. market with liquidity (or some say, flooded it) and kept interest rates low over the last two years, its officials contended through 2021 that creeping inflation was ""transitory.""

In late May, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admitted she had been wrong.

""I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,"" [she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-inflation-cnntv/index.html?utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_content=2022-05-31T22%3A30%3A07&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_medium=social) in an interview. ""There have been unanticipated and large shocks that have boosted energy and food prices, and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I ... at the time, didn't fully understand.""

The Fed has approved three interest rate hikes this year, with the latest in mid-June constituting [the largest single increase in the country since 1994 at 75 basis points.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/fed-hikes-its-benchmark-interest-rate-by-three-quarters-of-a-point-the-biggest-increase-since-1994.html?&amp;doc=107088703) After June's inflation print of 9.1%, analysts predict the central bank could deploy a massive 100 basis point rate rise to combat inflation, which in the U.S. is at its highest in 40 years.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, when asked earlier this week by reporters about the likelihood of the hike, replied, ""Everything is in play.""",finance,1657899062

personalfinance,Do services like Affirm help to build credit history for future loans?,"I'm in a pretty great financial position. I graduated college debt free and got a great job and I've always been able pay cash up front for everything except apartment leases, but my monthly rent payments don't get reported to credit bureaus. At this point, 30% of my pre-tax income is going into some kind of savings or another.

I have a few credit cards I pay off every month and a credit score in the 790s, but I've had trouble getting competitive interest rates on loans because creditors don't like that I've never taken out a loan before. Despite my great creditworthiness score, all of my credit is revolving lines (i.e., credit cards), so when I have shopped for loans in the past, the interest rates I've qualified for have usually been a little over double the best available rate from the same institution.

Well, right now I'm a couple weeks away from buying some furniture, and one day I'm going to need to get a loan to buy a house. I already have more than enough money set aside for this specific purchase to be able to pay cash. However, when I saw that the store offered six month 0% APR financing it seemed like it might be a good opportunity to put a loan on my credit history. This place in particular does their in-store financing through Affirm. I'm wondering if financing this purchase instead of paying cash is a reasonable way to build my credit history and help me qualify for better interest rates on home loans in the future?

I've searched the subreddit and seen other questions about this, but it seems like most of the questions are from people who were financing in order to make a purchase more affordable in the short-term. I already have the cash set aside, so it doesn't really get any more affordable than that. For me this is just a question of trying to build my credit history.",finance,1657899636

I commute to an instate, public school and my cost of attendance is about $21k / year, and I will graduate in 2024. I am asking for advice on how you guys think I should plan out my expenses for the next year.

My grandpa is an 80-year-old disabled veteran, and in exchange for me helping him with day-to-day tasks, I live with him rent free and utility free, which I am very grateful for. Mom and dad are not part of my life.

During the school year I will be working part-time, best case income would be about $1500/mo post tax and worst case would be about $900/mo post tax.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1657900822
personalfinance,"Looking for advice on how to best allocate my current savings - pay off debt, use for house, or just keep saving?","I have been having anxiety about how to allocate my savings (currently $108k) towards my financial goals and am hoping for some advice. My 3 primary financial goals are: (i) pay off student loans (currently $234k); (ii) buy a house; and (iii) eventually quit my demanding job for something that has more reasonable time requirements (which will be a significant pay cut). 

I would love some opinions on what is the best way/order for allocating my savings. I have more specific details below. It’s a bit long, so I really appreciate you taking the time to read this!! (Using a throwaway due to financial info being disclosed).

*ABOUT ME:* I am in my late 30s, married, no kids. Live in U.S. Spouse is not currently working due to medical issues. We live in MCOL area (recently moved from VHCOL area and I am now working remotely). 

*STUDENT LOANS:* Borrowed $198k (undergrad + law school). Have paid $112k. Current balance is $234k (I accrued a ton of interest at the beginning of my career). All loans are federal and rates generally range from 6.8-7.9% (full breakdown is at the end of this summary). Loans are currently paused and 0% until 8/31. I have been aggressively saving and currently have $108k earmarked for the loans, but I am now questioning whether I should apply the full amount to loans. I’m setting aside ~$8k/month and expect to have ~$120k by 8/31.

*OTHER DEBT:* My only other debt is a car loan, which is $850/month. It’s a 3 year/0% loan. Spouse and I share the car. Public transportation is not realistically available where I currently live. 

*INCOME:* Current salary is $345k (with potential $90k bonus in March 2023 if I hit hours-can’t rely on this). My salary is lockstep, meaning it goes up to a set amount each year. Will be $370k in 2023 and $400k in 2024 if I can make it that long (with $105k/$115k bonus, respectively, subject to hour requirements). Bonus is paid in March of each year. I’ve been at this job for 3.5 years (started at $190). Prior to that my salary was $115k (and before that $60k - job hopping is key!). I am very fortunate to have such a high salary, but my job is also very demanding. If I take a less demanding job, my new salary would likely be $90-$140k. I think I can still live very comfortably at that salary, but want to make sure I am being smart with the current high income while I have it. 

*ASSETS:* I currently have ~$133k in cash. Of that, $108k is earmarked for student loans; a portion will go to this month’s expenses; and the remainder is earmarked for my E-Fund or other smaller “digital envelope” funds (e.g., vet fund, vacation fund, gifts savings, medical, etc.). I have maxed out my 401k for the year. I do not have a separate Roth. My 401k is currently around $150k, but I’ve stopped checking the balance for a while.

*EXPENSES:* I reviewed my last 12 months of expenses and it looks like I spend about $6k/month on average (after taxes and other pre-tax deductions). My rent is $2200.  Car payment is $850. My only other large expense is travel for work. Without going into too much detail, I negotiated to be able to work remotely; provided that I travel to the office on a monthly basis at my own cost. This ranges from $2-2.5k/month). Arrangement is worth it to me for various personal reasons.  I paid off one of my student loans last year, which was a lump sum payment of $63k (I paid that one first because it had a co-signor). I didn’t include this in the average (and also excluded the recent moving costs).

*HOUSE GOAL:* I’m renting a SFH ranch and would be very happy to buy something similar (would love if the LL would sell the current house to me). Housing market is weird, as you know. I think I’d be targeting a house in the $450-$475k range (but haven’t looked into this too much yet). 

*STUDENT LOAN BREAKDOWN:* This is getting really long, but in case it is helpful, here is the breakdown of my student loans:

7.9% Interest ($127.9k):
#1 - 72.6k
#2 - 45.5k
#3 - 9.8k

6.8% Interest ($86.2):
#4 - 19.8k
#5 - 18.8k
#6 - 17.6k
#7 - 10k
#8 - 10k
#9 - 10k

stocks,"We don't know that inflation has peaked, and if it has, we don't know what will be required to get it down to the normal range.","Ther's a lot of talk about gas prices on this sub, and the assumption is that dropping gas prices will drop inflation due to the effect of fuel on a variety of good costs.  However, keep a few things in mind:

* **Three month core inflation is higher than six month core inflation**, and six month core inflation is higher than twelve month core inflation.  That implies an acceleration in core inflation (which excludes fuel and food, btw).  Larry Summers discussed this in an interview yesterday: [https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/07/larry-summers-on-the-likelihood-of-a-recession.html](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/07/larry-summers-on-the-likelihood-of-a-recession.html)
* **Shelter is a major component of inflation numbers, and rising rents are the only thing that matters.**  CPI doesn't factor in real estate transaction prices.  Instead, it factors in rents and ""owner's equivalent rent,"" which is just the rental value of one's home.  So even if the real estate market is slowing down, the shelter component of CPI won't come down unless rents cool.  They show no signs of it thus far.  To my eye, rising rent prices are the most under-the-radar contributor to CPI, and they are raging right now.
* **Inflation will peak at some point, but the real question is what it will take to get back down to 2-3%.**  It's great to go from 9% to 7%, but if the Fed has to keep hiking for another year to get us down to their target range, it's extremely unlikely that we avoid a significant recession.  IMO, that scenario is not baked into stock prices.

I'm not saying that inflation hasn't peaked, of course.  But there are still significant tailwinds for inflation, and rising retail inventories and dropping gas prices don't suddenly eliminate inflation as a concern.

We'll learn a lot in the next few weeks.  If we do in fact have a second quarter of negative GDP growth next week (likely), the Fed is in a bit of a hard spot.  Normally, they would start accomodating at this point, but they can't.  And if inflation doesn't start dropping quickly, they might still have a long road ahead of them on which they have to be hawkish.  We would then be in an unusual spot in which the Fed is hiking and tightening during a recession.  Given the lag time that rate hikes have, there is a significant risk of overaction and a significant recession.",finance,1657904200

*****
&gt; Investors are likely to switch their focus to earnings season, after the market’s wild ride on rising and falling expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week. The three major indexes posted sharp gains Friday, after worries the Fed would raise rates by a full point this month faded. Still, stocks notched weekly losses, with the S&amp;P 500 was down nearly a percent at 3,863.16.
*****
&gt; A surprise 9.1% year-over-year jump in June consumer inflation Wednesday drove speculation the Fed would be willing to battle rising prices by going beyond the three-quarter point hike, anticipated on July 27.
*****
&gt; But by Friday, comments from Fed officials, a surprise 1% gain in June retail sales, and some better data on consumer inflation expectations reversed those expectations in the futures market.
*****
&gt; “It really was a great study in mob psychology. We went into the week with a 92% chance it was a 75 basis point hike, and we exited Wednesday with an 82% chance it was going to be 100 basis points,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. A hundred basis points is equal to one percentage point.
*****
&gt; By Friday, strategists said there was just about a 20% chance for a 100 basis point hike priced into the market.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, earnings news could set the tone as a diverse group of companies report. Big banks continue with reports Monday, with releases from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Netflix and Lockheed Martin post results on Tuesday. Tesla and United Airlines issue their quarterly figures Wednesday. AT&amp;T, Union Pacific and Travelers are among those reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon both release earnings Friday.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there are a few key data releases, mostly around housing. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index will post on Monday. Housing starts are out Tuesday, and existing home sales are due Wednesday. On Thursday, there is the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey. Finally, both manufacturing and services PMI are released on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Every data point matters and also what companies are saying. Next week... it’s a much broader picture in terms of earnings and the economy,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. “If there are negative revisions and mounting concerns from the guidance, I think then you are going to see questions as to how the Fed is going to interpret that…The other point is whether or not the market can build off today’s rally.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings expectations
&gt; Strategists have been expecting the second-quarter earnings season to contain disappointments and downward revisions, as companies deal with inflation, supply chain issues, staff shortages — and now a slower economy.
*****
&gt; “We can shift to earnings and that will take up all the oxygen in the room. There’s a possibility this is where the market could make some traction,” said Hogan. “We haven’t really heard from anybody but big banks. There’s a chance that expectations are so low, and the narrative around guidance is that it’s going to have to come down. If it doesn’t, there’s a chance we’ll see a positive reaction to that.”
*****
&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to gain 5.6%, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. As of Friday morning, 35 S&amp;P companies had reported, and 80% of those reported earnings above forecasts, Refinitiv found.
*****
&gt; Hogan noted that by the end of earnings season, companies usually beat at a 65% pace. “It’s just a function of keeping your guidance. The same guidance is going to be good enough,” he said. “We saw that with PepsiCo first out of the gate, leaving the forward guidance the same, and the stock was applauded for that. That could be the norm, rather than the exception.”
*****
&gt; Krosby said investors will also be watching housing data, after the rapid jump in mortgage rates.
*****
&gt; “It is a litany of real estate focus, which is important because we want to see how the housing market is holding up,” she said. “It’s a focus for the Fed to slow down the housing market. We’ll see how that unfolds.”

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Performance Before, During and After Recessions

&gt; A recession has widely been defined by many economists as two consecutive quarters of decline in GDP. Whether or not you are a glass half-full or half-empty person, Q1 U.S. GDP was negative which does satisfy half of that definition. More recently the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model’s estimate for Q2 U.S GDP is also negative. In an effort to gain a better understanding of the market’s performance before, during and after recessions we have compiled the following table.

&gt; Dates for U.S recessions were sourced from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Since 1945, there have been 13 U.S. recessions. The most recent and shortest was the result of Covid-19 and began in February 2020 and ended two months later in April. The longest recession post WWII was caused by financial crisis in 2008-2009 and lasted 18 months. The average duration of a recession has been 10.2 months.

&gt; Historically, in the 1-year period prior to the start of the recession, S&amp;P 500 has been positive 53.8% of the time with an average gain of 4.12%. In the table above, the year before the recession began is calculated using monthly closes. For example the 1-year prior to the Covid-19 recession was calculated using the close from January 2019 through the close of January 2020. During recessions S&amp;P 500 historically advanced 46.2% of the time but with an average loss of 1.22%. Once the recession ended S&amp;P 500 generally tended to soar 14.45% on average higher over the next year with gains occurring 84.6% of the time.

&gt; # Short Interest Keeps Rising

&gt; Over the past few days, equities, including the most heavily shorted stocks, have reversed a good amount of the gains seen since the mid-June lows. A basket of the 100 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 3,000 is currently little changed versus its levels at the start of 2020 compared to a roughly 16% gain for the Russell 3000. Whereas heavily shorted stocks saw massive outperformance versus the broader market in the second half of 2020 and early 2021, that outperformance has unwound since last fall. More recently over the past two months, though, highly shorted stocks and the Russell 3000 have been performing more or less in line with each other as the relative strength line has trended sideways and is near similar levels to the COVID Crash.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-SIPF-1.png))**

&gt; The most recent short interest data as of the end of June was also updated in the past 24 hours. For the whole of the Russell 3000, the average reading on short interest as a percentage of float currently stands at 6.24%. That is up 20 basis points since the prior update for mid-June and a full percentage point higher versus the start of the year.

&gt; Across nearly all industry groups, there have been major shifts in short interest levels since the start of the year. While most have made considerable moves higher, there are others that have actually fallen significantly like Food &amp; Staples Retail and Telecommunication Services. Given the big increases this year, Retail continues to have the highest average reading on short interest followed by the Pharmaceuticals, Biotech &amp;Life Sciences, and the automobile industries. Although their levels of short interest are not as elevated, Software &amp; Services and Energy stocks saw the largest increases from the last report while only the Media &amp; Entertainment industry and Food &amp; Staples Retailing stocks saw declines in average short interest between the two most recent reports. That being said, none of those sequential moves were particularly large with the biggest absolute move being the 0.45 percentage point increase in Software &amp; Services.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-SIPF-2.png))**

&gt; Switching over to the individual stocks with the highest levels of short interest, Dillard's (DDS) currently tops the list with a little more than half of its shares sold short. That reading is only half of a percentage point higher versus mid-June but has nearly doubled since the start of the year. Although it continues to sit near the top of the list, Redbox Entertainment (RDBX), has perhaps seen the most notable shift in levels of short interest versus the last bi-weekly report. Throughout the year, the recent has seen large swings in its reported short interest levels.

&gt; # NASDAQ Midyear Rally Fizzles and Bears Not Expected to Hibernate Until Late Q3/Early Q4

&gt; On the heels of one of the roughest first half starts in decades; the market had found some footing during the seasonally bullish start to the second half of the year here in the beginning of July. Even during historically meager midterm years, the first half of July has generated respectable gains. However much like the first half of the year, typical first half of July strength appears to have come to an end. After briefly entering positive territory, NASDAQ’s midyear rally is now a bust down 2.3% at today’s close with only two days remaining in the 12-day span.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4d9f1ff40bf609de63c5210bf9b83511/bbc53449c9f2074f-a5/s540x810/b89748db4ac85b49410d064508152c9414c47eb8.jpg))**

&gt; As you can see in the updated S&amp;P 500 seasonal pattern chart, through today’s close above, S&amp;P 500 has rolled over and appears to be tracking the sideways trading action in in “All Midterm Years” and “Democratic President Midterm” years. We still believe this bear market will put in a typical midterm-election-year bottom sometime later this year. The bottom is most likely to be in the August-October timeframe just ahead of the midterm elections and possibly around the time when the Fed begins to signal that it may slow or even pause its rate hike cycle.

&gt; # Bulls Back Above 25%

&gt; In spite of the S&amp;P 500's consistent declines in the past week as it failed to take out its late June highs, investor sentiment has turned around (relatively speaking) with this week's reading from the AAII showing 26.9% of respondents reporting as bullish for the first time since early June. The 7.5 percentage point increase in the percentage of bullish responses this week was a large week-over-week increase by historical standards, although there have been multiple even bigger larger weekly increases over the past few months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071422-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; With the increase in bullish sentiment, over a quarter of respondents reported as bullish for the first time in five weeks. Such extended streaks with as depressed readings have been few and far between with the last five-week streak occurring all the way back in the summer of 1993. Overall, there have now only been six streaks in which bullish sentiment remained below 25% for at least 5 consecutive weeks. The longest of these was in December 1990 when it went on for 9 weeks in a row. Albeit a small sample size, historically the end of these streaks have not been raging buy signals for the S&amp;P 500 in the short term with inline performance versus all periods and somewhat weak returns one month out. However, three, six, and twelve months later the S&amp;P 500 has been higher almost every time with slightly stronger than normal performance (six months out from the March 1990 occurrence was the only decline).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071422-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment was met by bears falling back below 50% to 46.5%. Mirroring bullish sentiment, that made for the lowest reading since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071422-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result of those moves, the bull-bear spread remains firmly in favor of bears. With the percentage of bearish responses outnumbering bulls by 19.6 points, for the 15th week in a row the bull-bear spread remains negative. That steak has grown to be the third largest on record behind a 22-week streak ending in late 1990 and a 34-week streak ending in October 2020.

&gt; Neutral sentiment has managed to avoid major shifts in sentiment in recent weeks and this week was no exception. This reading fell modestly from 27.8% to 26.6%. That is well within the range of the past couple of years' readings and is only the lowest since three weeks ago.

&gt; # More Burning on Hot Inflation

&gt; For most of the session yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 was having trouble choosing a direction, but come the final hours of trading with a CPI release looming, the index took a decisive turn lower. Given rampant hot inflation over the past couple of years and its implications for changes to monetary policy, that sort of late day selling ahead of CPI prints has been the norm as shown below. On average for the past two years, the day before CPI releases has typically seen the S&amp;P 500 trade higher for most of the session before turning lower and erasing its gains in the afternoon; just as we saw yesterday.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-CPI-1.png))**

&gt; With another hotter than expected print this morning for both headline and core measures of inflation, yesterday's late day sellers seem to have been on the right side of the trade as the S&amp;P 500 has fallen further and is on pace for the sixth drop on a CPI print in a row. Taking a look at intraday price action of the S&amp;P 500 on CPI release days, historically there has been a downward bias with all releases since 2000 averaging a drop of a few basis points by the close. Over the past two years it has been far worse with an average decline of 28 bps. Most of that drop has actually occurred after a bout of midday selling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-CPI-2.png))**

&gt; Using data from our Economic Indicator Database, filtering out for only times in which CPI has come in above expectations (on a month over month basis), that same pattern is apparent. The S&amp;P 500 tends to trade in the red for most of the morning but the worst declines occur in the early afternoon before some stabilizing into the close.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-CPI-3.png))**

&gt; In response to today's hotter than anticipated release, the S&amp;P 500 gapped down 1.2% which ranks as the fourth worst gap down for the index on a CPI day since at least 2000. Going back over the past two decades, there have only been a total of seven gaps down of 1% or more on a CPI day. Including today, four of those releases have occurred this year: February (-1.2%), March (-1%), June (-1.64%), and today (-1.23%). Taking a look at the intraday pattern of the S&amp;P 500 across those 1% or larger gaps, the index has tended to continue to fall throughout the session with the lows of the day tending to occur around 2:30 EST with modest sideways action into the close from there.

&gt; # This Isn't Normal

&gt; With inflation running out of control and markets furiously attempting to re-price Federal Reserve interest rate policy, we're seeing some truly wild moves in the fixed income markets. This week, the big moves have come at the short-end of the Treasury yield curve as three-month Treasury yields have surged by 35 basis points this week alone. While the 2y10y US Treasury yield curve has been inverted for seven trading days now, the 3m10y curve, which is the FOMC's preferred measure of the yield curve, has remained positively sloped, but the rate of flattening has really picked up in recent days and since early May has gone from around 225 bps to under 75 bps today.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-Curves.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, the bulk of the flattening in the 3m10y curve has occurred more recently. The chart below shows the 20-day rate of change in the 3m10y US Treasury yield curve since 1962. The red line indicates the threshold for 100 bps of flattening in a four-week span which is where we are at now. Prior to the current period, there wasn't a similar flattening of the 3m10y curve in a four-week span since the Financial Crisis. In August 2011, the rate of flattening got close to 100 bps in a four-week span but came up just shy. In other words, these types of moves in the yield curve don't happen very often.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-Four-week-change.png))**

&gt; How often are they? The chart below shows the distribution of four-week changes in the 3m10y yield curve over time grouped into 20 bps increments. Including the last few days, where we are at in the current period (-100 to -120 bps of flattening in a four-week span) has only occurred on 77 trading days, and there have only been a total of 223 trading days where the yield curve flattened by 100 bps or more in a four-week period. On a percentage basis, that works out to less than 1.5% of all trading days. When it comes to markets, it seems as though there's always something unique happening out there, and these days, you don't see what's happening at the short end of the Treasury curve very often.

&gt; # Another Curve Inverts

&gt; As of today, the percentage of inverted points on the yield curve reached the YTD highs seen in mid-June of 17.9%. This comes as the 10-year and 1-year invert, as well as the 5-year and 2-year. The inversion of points on the yield curve (particularly 2s&amp;10s) tends to be cited as a leading recession indicator, due to the fact that higher near-term yields imply a higher risk in the near-term rather than the long-term, the inverse of what is typically true. The graph below shows the rolling percentage of inverted points on the curve over the last six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/Yield-Curve-Inversions-071222.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, the spread between the 10-year and 1-year treasury inverted today, which is the first occurrence since October of 2019. Following prior inversions of this part of the yield curve since 1970, a recession has followed in the next two years 99.8% of the time which would suggest that a recession at some point in the next two years is almost certain. Following the first inversion in at least one year when a recession did follow, it has taken an average of 271 trading days to officially enter a recession. The shortest time it took to enter into a recession following 1s and 10s inversion was in 1973, when it took just 191 trading days. As mentioned, going back to 1970, recessions have followed within two years of an inversion 99.8% of the time. The only time that this part of the curve inverted and a recession did not follow within two years was after a brief stint in the fall of 1998.

Bitcoin,Historical US Home Prices: A Monetization Story,"Everything here is referencing this chart (make sure to expand the timeline to show the full history back to the 1950's):

[https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/](https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/)

Been doing my own research to see how various assets have behaved relative to inflation, but also relative to various changes in monetary policy in the US.

**This chart showing US home prices both in nominal and CPI-adjusted values tells a striking story:**

1. Notice that housing prices generally trend lower against CPI up until around 1968.
2. You then see the first bump against CPI peak right around 1971, where Bretton Woods takes us off the gold standard.
3. A lot was happening behind the scenes leading up to Bretton Woods so it makes sense that the housing market started to respond a few years ahead of 1971.
4. After this first CPI-adjusted peak, you see median housing prices go down against CPI but the entire move is upward in nominal terms.
5. People knew housing prices should be going up but didn't realize by how much. This represents the first mis-pricing of the housing market.
6. What follows is a sequence of larger and larger housing bubbles where the lows never return to previous values, even in the CPI-adjusted scale.
7. This rise in value against inflation shows that housing was clearly being monetized as a store of value.
8. This monetization results in an increase in volatility as price discovery takes over the utility value of property.
9. Before all of this started the CPI-adjusted value of homes hovered around the $190,000 range, which means home values today would need to drop \~50% to remove the monetization component.
10. That's 50% of a \~$7 trillion dollar US housing market just to reach parity with historic CPI changes (in other words, to make housing a perfect store of value rather than an appreciating asset).

**How does this relate to Bitcoin?**

1. Bitcoin is also being monetized.
2. Bitcoin is highly volatile as people struggle to price it.
3. Bitcoin represents a store of value tool which can more reliably (and with less maintenance) keep your purchasing power.
4. Bitcoin can simultaneously suck the monetary premium out of real estate and other properties which have intrinsic utility people need making life more affordable for everyone.
5. That's \~$3.5 trillion from the US housing market alone.

**Disclaimers:**

I'ver heard some people argue that Bitcoin will take a lot more value out of real estate, but due to its utility and scarcity I believe it's justified that housing keep up with the CPI basket. Also, because CPI under cuts the reality of those other things in the basket as well (like swapping out types of food, energy etc.) it could even be less than \~$3.5 trillion once you adjust for ""real"" inflation whatever that is.

Still, it's clear that housing has undergone a monetization and financialization that should be sucked into Bitcoin. **We can't really expect housing to become deflationary in fiat terms so Bitcoin will not fix an ever increasing housing market.** But it can vastly reduce both the rate and volatility of the housing market if it were to take off in a much bigger way.

That said, watching the housing market increase in volatility so rapidly despite being rather illiquid gives me some concern over whether Bitcoin can actually reduce in volatility over time. It certainly will to some extent, but with how liquid it is I don't think anything sub $10 trillion is likely to be any less volatile than it is today. Even above that **it may just be that Bitcoin remains volatile as long as we have fiat playing a significant role in the global economy** (because at the end of the day the volatility is a result of monetizing something that isn't the denominator of value).

personalfinance,New build - extended rate lock,"Hey PF, 

Wife and I recently signed for a new build that *should* be completed within a year (fingers crossed). We’re talking to a few lenders that offer extended rate locks for jumbo loans. 

Their terms are all fairly similar (example below):

- Rate 5.000%   Buy points 2.125

- Rate 5.125%     Buy points 1.750

- Rate 5.250%     Buy points 1.500

There is a .750 cost due upfront of which we will credit back .500 at closing. 

To me, it’s a no brainer to lock-in asap, considering the Fed says +1 base point is up for consideration. Without knowing future rates I cannot calculate the breakeven, but it’s fair to assume they’ll be much higher going into next year….  Without getting into the weeds, the builder is cautiously optimistic closing will be April ‘23. Obviously that’s the risk.

Additional info - Sale price $1m, 20% down, 815 credit, planning to stay in the house at least 8 years…

gaming,"PS5 Owners Beware of Buying ""New"" PS5 Controllers From Amazon","Just a heads up too my fellow PS5 Owners. I recently purchased a ""new"" Midnight Black PS5 controller from Amazon during Prime Day as it was $20 bucks off. I received it today and noticed that the seal sticker was rather off kilter. That was my first indication that something was fishy, mainly because they are always perfectly adjusted to the box. Than my suspicion was granted more weight when I noticed that the plastic covering that all controllers come in was rather scuffed and placed in the wrong position. The final nail in the coffin was when I took the controller out of the plastic cover and inspected it with a magnifying glass and flash light. There was clear indication of use, not very much but it was still clear that someone had used it before. There were small scratches and minor blemishes on the touch pad and a clear scuff mark on the back (albeit small) of the controller.

Quite frankly I don't give a flying fuck if it was taken out for a second and put back in. If I am buying a item and it is being advertised as new, I expect a new item never before touched or opened, period. And so I am writting this to warn my fellow consumers, if you do buy a controller from Amazon double check it! Hell, triple check! Do not let these assholes get away with charging you full price for a used item. I issued my return and next time I buy a controller it will be directly from Sony's store.

personalfinance,To sell our new house or not?,"Let me lay out some details and maybe I can get some advice. I know nobody can make the decision for me but here we go.

The family is myself, my wife, and out 4 year old daughter who needs to attend a school system starting now. We waited over 1.5 years for our house to be built. It was ridiculous. I am in Texas. We contracted for 345k. After closing we owe 328k. The house is apparently worth over 400k now. 2300 square feet. 4 bed 2 bath and one office. Half an acre of land. We have about 108k in savings right now. I make approx. 73k per year. My wife was making approx. 45k per year but she took a new position based on commission that has a much larger pay potential. My wife is starting a new job that potentially pays a lot more than her old but is an entrepreneurial move that comes with more risk. She has amazing work ethic and is almost always successful. She has a lot of support within the company. The kicker? Her pay will not start rolling in for 3-6 months but the potential payout is much higher than her old salary. I have faith in her. We will lose approx. 1k per month while waiting for her income to roll in but we have 108k in the bank so we have plenty of cushion to weather the storm including potential emergencies. Important: The house payment escrowed is $2600 per month thanks in part to taxes. Typical rent of a similar home would be more. Minimum payment for a decent square footage house for us would be 2k. The neighborhood is amazing which also puts an extra premium on the home due to our daughter.

My concerns include a potential recession, housing crash, and falling upside down on our home. We can always sell the house should her job not work out, but we do not want to lose money on the house. If her job didn't work out we could potentially need to relocate on the future.

Option 1: Sell the house for a profit and face the potential of paying capital gains. We stay in our current rent house: a 750 square feet. 1 acre of land. $1000 per month. Additionally paying $68 per month for storage. We would add extra money to our current savings for a potential future buy in case of a crash but nobody can predict this obviously.

Option 2: Keep the house until we find out out how lucrative my wife's job is. Should be minimum her past salary and potentially double or triple.. Lose approx. 1k per month temporarily and eat into the approx. 108k in savings. We still have the potential to sell the house but the market may not be so nice by that time.

Does anyone have any suggestions for this scenario? Crazy how we work so hard to put ourselves in a good position, but still have so many doubts. There is so much at stake and life is short.

I received $14k. I have retained an attorney for injuries. Now my original car was bought outright so auto financing is somethin i dont know anything about. 

My credit score is low due to my bk and recently closing 2 cards I paid off (crazy high apr) using a DMP, 2 months before my accident.

#2. Probably going to exceed that peak sometime in the next 1-10 years

In 2020 and 2021, the government was supporting the economy with trillions of dollars in PPP money, stimulus and unemployment checks, housing support, money for schools and local governments, etc. It is unsurprising that the economy began to decline once that support floor was pulled out from beneath us.

#The Shill Response

The standard response of shills have been:

**I. Crying about Trump.** The crybabies dishonestly attempt to insert ""false equivalency"" and ""slide"" arguments regarding Trump or Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner. They are off topic responses designed to limit discussion on Biden corruption.

**II. Crying that Hunter Biden did not hold office.** Voicemails, email, business transactions, wiring transfer orders, text messages and news reporting all confirm that Hunter Biden is involved in policy, domestic and abroad, bribery, domestic and abroad, and is involved with US defense contractors and works under Bohai Harvest specifically for the interest of China's state owned interests, where the interest is specifically stated (with pictures) that China wants American resources. Hunter Biden is a traitor. Hunter Biden sees no problem selling out a billion in US tax payer dollars for a few night with crack and hookers. Hunter Biden sees no problem selling out American resources to China for a few nights with crack and hookers.

**III. Focusing on Hunter Biden's genitals.** We understand that the unemployed moderators and jannies across the Internet are gay. They are obsessed with Hunter Biden's private parts. They use this to distract from the corruption, because they are desperate to defend a drug addled pedo because they religiously serve a political agenda that seeks to enslave the world with authoritarianism. Because these mods and jannies have no leg to stand to defend this, they project and accuse fervent researchers of wanting to look at Hunter Biden dick pics.

**IV. State actors are pushing disinformation and misinformation.**  There are 3 pictures that have been making the rounds that are intentional disinformation:

1) Natalie Biden with cocaine on her nose. It's not Natalie. Sure, it's a striking resemblance, but it's verified as being a cam girl. The shills use this to say ""the data is fake"" but, really, their argument is what's fake. Anyone with the data knows this picture isn't real.

2) Joe Biden with asian girl. This is actually a BDSM video from xvideos that has been around for years. The face of the old man is clearly visible in portions of the video and is, in fact, not Joe Biden. Shills love to use this type of disinfo to muddy the waters.

3) Hunter Biden with five young girls. This is not Hunter Biden, as Hunter Biden has never sported a black soul patch. Shills are using this to poison the well and distract from the corruption.

Other tactics, in this realm, include misnaming Natalie as Hallie, misnaming Zoe as Natalie and intentionally getting facts wrong to confuse everyone so that they can them claim falsehoods are being spread around as an excuse to censor information.

**V. Blatant Censorship.** Suppression is occurring where the news is ignoring the data. The news is in on it, showing that they can't be trusted and serve the liberal agenda. Big Tech is also in on it. But outright bans, deletions, harassment and death threats are happening to people who share the most damning stuff. This is why it is important to saturate the Internet with proof.

#Shill Groups

**1) Paid actors:** One group is upvotes.club. They aren't politically aligned, they merely get paid. Reddit accounts are bought and sold, upvotes and downvotes are bought and sold. Posts and comments are bought and sold. This group operates on many platforms.

**2) Political Actors:** ""Correct the Record"" was doxxed in John Podesta's emails and Shareblue was the bigger, badder replacement. American Independent, PACRONYM and other shill groups exist that engage in these behaviors, participating in, what amounts to, a giant RICO scheme.

**3) State Actors and their contractors.** Mossad has been heavily involved in suppressing Hunter Biden data, as well as the Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein issues. They even create cut outs that work for US Intelligence and make fake threat reports to villainize people who want to share information about political corruption in the US. SITE Intelligence Group, for example, pretends to be ""online extremists"" to justify censorship and submit threat reports on their own astroturfing to the US Government painting certain groups as ""domestic terrorists"". In fact, SITE Intelligence Group are  foreign terrorists who have weaponized the Internet against Americans.

It is important to understand shill tactics, so you can point them out, in plain language, to shut them down.

Politico's KYLE CHENEY, NATASHA BERTRAND and ANDREW DESIDERIO were first at bat to blatantly lie to you. Take note, you cannot trust Politico about anything as a result of their disinformation.

https://archive.ph/jmcrg

Politico published lies when it stated:

&gt; No evidence has emerged, beyond the purported correspondence, that the former VP was involved in or profited from his son’s overseas work or abused his position to support it.

We have hundreds of emails that prove this is a false statement, pictures, videos, and even a voicemail from Joe Biden, himself. This was all on the laptop.

&gt;It’s not totally clear. The New York Post, which published the first installments of the leaked emails, claimed they proved Joe Biden met with an adviser to Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where Hunter Biden was a board member. But the emails alone don’t substantiate the claim.

It is perfectly clear, based on a single picture that was heavily censored by Big Tech, that Politico lies.

https://i.redd.it/e0dsor2soxb91.png

&gt; But there is no evidence that Hunter Biden ever struck a deal with the Chinese company, let alone that his father got a cut—income from China does not appear in Biden’s tax returns, including from the year of the alleged transaction. 

Politico lies about the Hunter Biden Chinese influence peddling because, in 2020, we already knew all about Bohai Harvest, Rosemont Seneca and the Sinopec deal proved Politico was covering for an ongoing scheme. Again, RICO charges are appropriate.

I'm new to this subreddit, thought I'd see what advice or tips I could get before going off on my own as I tend to do lol. I did check the New to personal finance thread read first section, and while informative and helpful didnt quite have what I was looking for.

I'm in about 23k credit card debt currently. (Due to family and my own mental health, emergency vet bills, emergency car repair bills etc.), the interest rates on the 2 cards is keeping me from making any progress, so I'd like to get a loan and pay them both off and only have 1 monthly payment to worry about. 

What banks or companies will offer the best interest rates? And any other tips or advice will be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,I'm pretty sure my i-Bond interest is wrong on the Treasury Direct site.,"I'd be interested if someone believes I've misunderstood how the calcs are made and would be further interested if anyone else is seeing the same thing.

I've purchased i-bonds twice, both times $10k, once in late October '21, so an issue date of 10/1/21 and then in late January '22, so an issue date of 1/1/22.  Both bonds have an identical ""current value"" of $10,176 as of today (7/16/22).

The 10/1/21 bond looks right with interest accrued on 4/1/22 based on the 5/1/21 6-month-rate of 1.77% (ok, not sure why $176 rather than $177, but whatever).

The 1/1/22 bond being $10,176 makes no sense.  Its 7/1/22 accrual should be based on the 11/1/21 6-month-rate of 3.56%.

Anyone care to either enlighten me, or check their own account?

As a note, the ""current"" interest rate (here shown annually) on the form appears correct: 7.12 for the 10/1/21 bond (which will go to 9.62 on 10/1/22) and 9.62 for the 1/1/22 bond (which will go to whatever is set Nov '22 on 1/1/23).

personalfinance,How to find out value of no-par shares granted by employer 20+ years ago? (US. WA state),"I'm very new to PF and related topics, so please pardon my naivete. 

In 1996, my boss gave all us workers a holiday bonus of shares in the company. Boss started and owned the company privately until the share offering that year--we received some and the public could buy shares too. These are common shares with no par value. Sales were not on an exchange. The employees like me who received these shares paid federal income taxes on them at the time. 

Since then, the company has been sold (possibly a few times, not sure), went into receivership in 2019, but then was bought by some locals who are currently trying to revive it. 

Assuming the place stays running (which it well might post-pandemic; it's well liked), is it possible my shares have any value now? Do shares like these keep any of their value when a company changes ownership, even without my doing anything at the time of those transactions? And, how do I find out what that value is -- are these things researchable or could I just email/call the company?

Also, I have a signed certificate that I kept all these years and it indicates number of shares, type, date, my name.

Thanks in advance for any help.",finance,1658001737
personalfinance,How feasible is early retirement for me?,"Hello!

I've been doing a lot of napkin math with online calculators and just wanted to hear the opinions from other people who have a better grasp of finances on how feasible it would be for me to retire early, or at least work when I want to work until normal retirement age. From what I have gathered it seems possible.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background info**:
I recently turned 26 in June but have been working for about a year now at a hospital. During that time, about 6-7 months of it I was working what we call in the healthcare field ""as needed"" but at essentially full-time hours. This position is not eligible to receive benefits. In late February, I moved up to a full-time position and started seriously planning for the future since I was now eligible to receive most of my benefits. I just became eligible after working for a year to qualify for the employer matching which is 4% at 100% + a basic 2% contribution, but up until that time, I have been contributing ~22% of my paycheck to my 403b plan since I had missed out on the first couple paychecks and I have to pay a little bit more as such to catch up to the max. 

**Current compensation**: 125k-130k (from what my coworkers say usually a 3.5% raise yearly) but my actual amount varies since I pick up extra shifts regularly

**Savings**: 70k in checking and 30k savings

**Investments**: I only started buying investments in March (Right before things got cheaper!) and I wasn't sure what to do with IRA's as I was under the impression that relatively quickly I would be unable to contribute or at least only partially contribute to a Roth IRA based on how much money I would be making. Additionally, I also thought at the time that doing a backdoor Roth IRA would be too much of a hassle to set up, but I now know better after watching some youtube videos. So I only opened up a taxable brokerage account which I have split 50/50 into QQQ and VOO, of which I have invested around $6k of each stock for a total of $12k, with my strategy being a dollar cost average of $2k USD/month for now at least.

My 403b plans didn't exactly have too much to choose from but I ended up deciding to invest in VIIIX which is an index fund that appears to track the SNP 500 and since it is a Vanguard plan with a low expense ratio I figured it wouldn't be a bad decision. My plan currently has ~$9.5k invested.

So in total, I have $21.5k invested right now. 

Finally, I max out my HSA as well.

(I recognize that I have some overlap between VOO and VIIIX in the SNP 500 and even some overlap between QQQ tracking the NASDAQ, can't be that bad right?)

&amp;nbsp;

Currently, I live with my older brother and his wife who are also well off and they give me a family discounted rent of $600/month. This is, outside of buying food/gas/occasional vacations, my only expected cost of living, as I am lucky enough to have no debt to pay off from both undergrad and graduate school. Eventually, they will kick me out once they start their family which is in another 1-2-3 years? When this does happen though, my older sister has offered to let me stay at her townhome for $880/month~.

I was originally looking to buy a place to own but immediately got turned off because of the interest rates rising and I just feel that the housing market is so overpriced that it's difficult to want to actually own a place. Part of me is hoping the ""bubble"" crashes but with the supply in my area being so low it's hard to see any substantial reductions in home prices.

In any case, right now and in the short-term future, I am living far below my means, so I'm taking advantage of that by pumping money into investments while my cost of living is low, and holding onto a small stockpile of cash in the event I find a place to call my own.

&amp;nbsp;

**After current deductions and taxes (including insurance and maxing 403b and whatnot)**:

Bi-weekly take-home: ~$2500 USD *26 weeks = $65k

$65k - $6k Roth IRA = $59k

$59k - $2k = $57k because my employer sucks at doing taxes so I'll deduct some more

$57k/12 months = $4750 leftover monthly

&amp;nbsp;

What would be the max home price you would be comfortable with paying with this monthly? (My FICO score is 816 and I would be a first-time homebuyer if that makes a difference on the loan I would secure)

&amp;nbsp;

Using SmartAsset's 401k calculator for my 403b, with a return of 6% and inflation of 2% I end up with around ~$1.1m at 45. And using the Investor.gov simple compound interest calculator with another 20 years of compounding that $1.1m becomes $2m to $6m with an interest rate of 6% and a variance of +-3%, even without contributing another dollar.

Using the same rates of 6% return and 2% inflation my Roth IRA would be $202k at 45, and using the same method as above that would become $365k to $1.1m

And finally, with the HSA I have the ability to also invest these funds as well. Using the same 6% return, a $3.6k annual contribution for 20 years becomes ~135k, which after another 20 years at 65 would become $244k to $757k

This is all also not including if I were to add some extra money into my taxable brokerage or acquiring a rental property (although I'm a bit hesitant at the work involved with having a rental property)

&amp;nbsp;

To be quite frank I'm a pretty frugal person (I'm still going strong in a 1997 4runner!) I truly and hopefully expect my cost of living to be relatively low when I get older especially after I finish paying off where I live, so wouldn't my money in a vacuum just continue to grow and grow in the long run until I croak? 

Would you guys ever switch over to bonds/treasuries, if so at what age? What do you guys think? 

Sorry if all this was too long!",finance,1658003760
personalfinance,ETFs versus Index funds for IRA and Brokerage account,"Hi all,

I'm days away from paying off all my credit card debt and plan on opening a Vanguard IRA very soon and likely a regular brokerage account soon thereafter.

I'm attracted to index funds because as I understand it, those investments dissuade you from emotional trading. I don't know how this works but perhaps there are transaction fees that aren't associated with ETFs? The only reason I'm really even considering ETFs is to be able to diversify my portfolio in the beginning.

For example, if I were to max out a new Roth IRA for the first year, I'd probably buy half in VTSAX and half in VITAX. But I feel like that's too high of a percentage in the international market and wouldn't be able to address it until the following year. If I open a brokerage account, I'd probably start with the same two funds and although index funds are by nature, diverse, is it wise to hold the exact same things in all your investment accounts? If I were to modify my potential holdings, maybe I'd be conservative the first year with my IRA and do half VBTLX half VTSAX. I assume VBTLX also has a $3,000 buy in minimum? With index funds for more modest investors, is it always sort of clumsy in the beginning until you have enough invested that you can diversify?

Additionally, a random thought about I bonds: It looks like VFIAX has a 7.8% profitability and VTSAX has about 8.2%. Obviously there's other factors at play, but to my untrained eye, it looks like I bonds are even more profitable than these funds if you buy in at the right time to be able to get a sense of projected interest rates. Thoughts?

For some background I'm 31, take home $32,000 annually, have low expenses currently and if I'm not earning $100,000 a year from my job in 4 years, something is seriously wrong. It's unlikely that I'll go back to school, but not outside the realm of possibility.

I appreciate any insight you may have. Thank you!",finance,1658003785
CryptoCurrency,Why July the 28th is going to be one of the most important dates for Crypto.,"Right now everything seems good, we hit a way too high inflation data but we are still pumping just a few days later and to not forget the merger hype seems to be kicking in again. So are we set for a few weeks of relief and maybe even reversal? Don't be foolish te real test of Crypto is yet to come.

On July 28th the US will release its Q2 GDP estimate, just for your memory the last Q1 report is at - 1.7% after it was predicted to be +1.1% by the walls street. And IF we get this quarter in the red too, then the US will officially be on a recession according to textbook rules. So we just have to not be in the minus can't be that hard right? For comparison the Atlanta FED had predicted a - 1.1% quarter a few days ago and now even updated that to a - 2.7% quarter. So a recession in the US is HIGHLY HIGHLY LIKELY and to be announced on July 28th.

This would be a historic event for Crypto to be in such a completly new environment it has never been in before and also for stock markets that's a recession for the first time since 2008, baring the flash-recession in 2020.

gaming,The industry is on a slippery,"At a glance, it would be easy to imagine that the games industry is no longer so squarely on the slippery slope that beggars description of its coutless and reaching issues. Stepping back from shaky individual references, and a general, flourishing sense of ""stylistic and creative maturity"", you'll quickly spy this for being little more than an improvement on the whitewash.

A paint that used to cover the corporate mould and rot: Not only has it taken the life of the functional side of game design - but is now taking the life of the creative side, too, turning it into a mess of self-referential null matter that takes every cue and beat from its most recent memory of its equally derivative peers. As it stands, we're too genre-savvy, too trope-aware; and so are our games. Along those lines, you might've noticed how our corporate-driven creative industries have seemingly cracked the code of how to emulate those those suble, nuanced cues that were once used to distinguish something brilliant, stylish, quality, or honest, from something that was bland, monetized, ingenuine, or hollow. In essence, over these last few years, *bad taste* has learned how to disguise itself, and is working very hard to dismantle good taste from the inside.

That's a broad tangent, though. It seems as if the games industry has successfully gone the way of the Film Industry - perfecting the output of mundane, brain-massaging, uninspired garbage veneered with dazzle and hype for maximum return on minimum effort.

Many people had said the Indie development scene would save industry from the corporate dinosaurs, leading the way with low costs and genuine intrigue as the AAA industry collapsed in on itself from years of utter misanthropy and absolute stagnation. Instead, with AAA having wrestled the industry and everything it touches under claw, the Indie market has been neatly engineered to serve as the 'prototype' farmland for ideas, creative sensibilities, and talent - in the same way that, for instance, independent film felstivals are now just an equally bland, overfed extension of modern cinema and its figureheads experimenting familiar concepts by the smallest possible incriments, and well away from anywhere they could have a serious effect on its culturally devastating status quo.

We haven't seen the Film industry 'recover'. Instead, we've seen it devolve along the same line of process, until it's become an utterly-encompassing echo chamber in all concievable respects of function or purpose - now existing in some kind of psycho-cultural paradigm that now defines quality from inside our own heads by its own convenient metrics. It's found a routine to grow fat, lazy, and stupid in, and the sheer power it posesses prevents any possible disruption of this situation. It's perfected the tricks that keep an underwhelmed audience returning in perpetuity to be underwhelmed, and is now perfecting the insulation to keep the monetary risk of creativity itself out of the equation.

The games industry is following the roadmap of the film industry's recent trudge towards dominion, down to the very footstep. Will this be the future of games as a business, too?

I mean, obviously it will be. We all know it will be. We have companies that employ entire departments to scout online spaces like this in order to gather such feedback so that it can be more effectively combatted and dismissed, in between all our wonderful brand-based fluff posts and nostalgia plugs and so on.

personalfinance,Navy Federal vs. Mortgage Company for first time home buyer?,"I’m a first time home buyer that banks and has an auto loan with Navy Federal. I think it would be better for me to go through a mortgage brokerage but I’m partial to Navy Federal based on my experience with them. Any advice?

So I and my boyfriend attended a free first time homebuyers class today to qualify for first time home buyer grant programs. It was super informative and we are looking to buy in the spring or about this time next year at the latest. He’s changing industries (doubling his pay) and I’m dealing with future of telework at my job so we wanted to start early and get things moving with these things settling by the end of August. 

The class mentioned that the first step is to find a lender and said there are the traditional banks and credit unions etc but today it’s most common to use mortgage companies who broker and can show you rates to shop around for. Obviously this is the smart thing to do financially. However, I’m feeling torn. 

I’ve been with Navy Federal since college in 2012. I’ve never had any issues with them. In fact they were willing to give me a secured credit card to rebuild my credit when no one else would, give me an auto loan when USAA denied me, etc. I’ve been with them throughout my financial journey after leaving Wells Fargo and can’t imagine ever going back to a bank. I stay with them even though their rates may be lower at times for savings or CCs because their customer service and banking experience is fantastic. I guess I feel loyal to their brand because I’ve had great experiences. My auto loan was my first auto buying experience and it was super simple. But I’ve read a lot of things that say they don’t have the best rates and people have had horrible experiences using them for home buying. 

Could anyone give advice on this? Any encouragement for using them or ways to make me feel more comfortable with another lender I have no rapport with if I really shouldn’t use them? Should I perhaps do a pre-approval with them and a mortgage company just to compare? Even with the class some of these steps feel a little overwhelming.",finance,1658008899

We currently pay about 200-300 per month for electricity atm.  They also said in Illinois we should see about a $15k check written to us to help subsidize the costs.  We can use that towards our loan, or spend it however.  And then a grant yearly from federal that comes with taxes.  My neighbor is doing it asap, I am more skeptical.  Need to do my research first.

Hey I'm not on reddit a lot nor do I post things but I was hoping someone, anyone, may have some extra insight. 
Basically the long story of it is we have a cat named Epona. She's almost 2 years old. We believe she possibly was born in a barn. She was sick Basically right when she was born which caused her to loose her sigh. Shes not known any other difference and navigated life rather well. She has her moments when things spook her but always bounced back fast. When we first got her she was timid but latched onto us very fast and loved being around us. Until Thursday night. We had a friend over for dnd and he brought this animal bone dagger with pelt skin. She got a whiff of it and I've honestly never seen her freak out so bad. She flew off the edge of the couch, bounced around like a bunny rabbit FULL floof until she tore up the stairs. Ever since then it's as if we are a stranger to her. She won't walk on the carpet and his terrified of every single noise that happens around her. 
I'm wondering if this event unlocked some sort of past core memory and she's Basically exhibiting PTSD. 
Today She's made a tiny bit of progress. She's eating and drinking a little bit and has started to groom herself and used the litterbox when I placed her in it. But she hardly takes any steps on her own. And if we move even a little she hunkers and poofs. She tried to climb out of the litterbox on her own and the moment her paws hit the carpet she poofed and bunny hopped in fear. She does a little better if placed on the bed. 

Things I have tried:
 A calming collar. 
Deep cleaning the whole downstairs of any animal smells that could linger. The upstairs is next. Some comfort is She's chosen the guest room as her kind of sort of safe space. 

I *do* understand traumatic events like this can take time to resolve. I guess I'm just grasping for straws because I'm so stressed and worried about her. 

Tomorrow I plan to go pick up a Thundershirt to try with her and then a vet call on Monday. 

I'm Basically just so upset and feel so so guilty that she's like this. I feel awful that she's terrified of the carpet and doesn't even seem to recognize us anymore. 
If anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears. 
I'm sorry this is so lengthy.


I also want to add she's fine around our other cat. She doesn't freak out when he walks in and around her or tries to groom her or shove his face up her butt 🤦‍♂️ she's not wanting to play with him but she's not exhibiting any fear around him nor the noises he makes.",cryptocurrency,1658041922

stocks,Dropbox analysis and valuation - The free cash flow is not so free,"Dropbox is a company that's been public for less than 4 years and the price today ($21.74) isn't that far from its IPO price of $21.

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals, provide insights about the key topics and value the company as a whole. The purpose is purely for education.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Dropbox?**

It is a cloud storage solution where content can be accessed from anywhere and shared with others. Today, with all the storage alternatives that we have and the progress that has been done in this field, well, it doesn't sound as revolutionary as it did 15 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**The key numbers**

As it is a subscription-based platform, the number of users plays a big role. This is what a lot of analysts pay attention to and although they look at the exact same numbers, they end up with different conclusions about the future of Dropbox.

\#1 - Registered users - Over 700m! - This is the first big number to focus on. This number is roughly 10% of the world population, so they are able to reach a lot of people.

\#2 - Paying users - 17m - Wait, is that a typo, that's only 2.5% of the total users. No, it is not a typo. Only 2.5% of the registered Dropbox users are actually paying users.

The question is, can they convert more users to become paying? Do you trust in their ability to do that? Here's when the analysts are clashing. On one side, the bulls are painting the picture of a future where the conversion is high, while the bears are asking the question where will this conversion start? This is a fair question as the users were there last year, the year before, and the year before...

&amp;#x200B;

**The financials**

The revenue formula is simple, **# of paying users** multiplied by the **average revenue per user**. Both of these numbers have been increasing and that reflects in the total revenue. The users, we already touched upon that earlier and it is clear that it depends on their ability to convert. The average revenue per user depends on their ability to either charge more for their existing service (which is tough, as their competitors are all giants - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) and their ability to create new product offerings (through R&amp;D or through acquisitions).

However, the growth of the revenue has been declining. From **19%** growth in 2019 to **15%** growth in 2020, to **13%** growth in 2021...

What about the pandemic? With the huge change from the traditional working environment to the remote/work-from-home, yet, surely the demand for this is surging. When I started analyzing Dropbox, I was expecting to see a surge in the revenue, so seeing that it isn't there, I was a bit disappointed.

As for the margins, they keep improving over time:

\- Gross margin improved from 72% in 2018 to 80% in 2021. The cost of service represents the expenses associated with the storage, delivery &amp; distribution of the platform/services, not only to the paying but also to the free users. so, free users burn some of Dropbox's cash.

All the operating expenses decreased as % of revenue between 2018 and 2021:

\- R&amp;D from 55% to 34%

\- Sales &amp; Marketing from 32% to 20%

\- G&amp;A from 20% to 20%

So the operating margin improved from -35% to 13%. Is there room to grow? Yes, absolutely. Based on the management's guidance, they can improve at least an additional 7% in the future, hence, the margin will be over 20%. On top of that, the investments that they make in the equipment cost them less than the historical amounts that they've paid, so the margin will increase even further over time.

&amp;#x200B;

**The key topic - the cash!**

One of the topics that you'll notice appearing most, especially around bull analysts is the free cash flow of the company and the expected increase in the coming years.

The free cash flow grew from $392m in 2019 to $491m in 2020, to $708m in 2021, and is expected to reach $1b in 2024!

The market cap today is roughly $8b. So, that's roughly 12.5% free cash flow yield (2024 is not that far, so I'm simplifying this). In theory, if Dropbox is not growing at all, and just pays the $1b out to the shareholders, that should bring a 12.5% return every single year, right? Well, not really.

We need to step back to better understand this. The free cash flow formula is quite simple:

Free cash flow = Operating cash flow - Capital expenditures

It represents **the cash that is free for the management** to decide what to do with it, whether that is buying back shares, paying it out as a dividend, acquiring a new company, or, well, just nothing yet.

As this is looking through the prism of cash and it doesn't take share-based compensation (it is not a cash movement) and it doesn't take acquisitions (Dropbox had 2 of them in the last 3 years, totaling over $300m) because that depends on management's decisions.

You might be wondering, well, isn't acquisition capital expenditure? It definitely falls in the same category, but free cash flow doesn't represent what's free to distribute to the shareholders. Again, it is the free cash flow left **for the management** to decide what to do with it.

If you notice, the free cash flows mentioned above are quite far from their operating result. The main reason is stock-based compensation, which is huge! It is roughly $300m/year. What does this mean?

Part of the employee compensation is not paid in cash, but in stock options/shares. This is not a cash expense, hence, looking through the cash lense, it just isn't there.

If Dropbox wants to maintain the number of shares outstanding, it would need to spend the $300m and buy back shares. Have they been doing that? Yes! The number of shares decreased by roughly 10% in the last 3 years. But it wasn't free, it cost them over $1.6b!

This is important to understand, so whenever we encounter free cash flow, we don't assume that's what is free for us as investors, because it isn't. The free cash flow for the investors is a lot lower.

&amp;#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the value of Dropbox. Below are my assumptions:

**- Revenue**: To increase 7% per year in the next 5 years, then slowly decline to 3%. - In line with the average analysts' expectation.

**- Operating margin:** To increase to 24% over the next 5 years.

**- Discount rate:** 6.7% to increase over time to 9.64% to reflect the environment that we're in today (with the FED increasing rates)

\- **Outcome:** $14.82/share

The DCF takes into account the $1.5b in cash and $2.4b debt that is on their balance sheet (As of Q1/2022) and the $650m equity options outstanding.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 75% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 24%. I could significantly be wrong in my assessment.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|22%|24%|26%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|50% ($3.3b)|$11.4|$12.7|$14.0|
|75% ($3.9b)|$13.3|$14.8|$16.3|
|120% ($4.9b)|$16.6|$18.4|$20.3|
|150% ($5.5b)|$18.2|$20.2|$22.2|

**My thoughts**

Dropbox is operating in a fairly competitive field and the fact that it couldn't significantly grow during the pandemic shows that the alternatives are more appealing.

The # of registered users is definitely a huge number, but unless they are monetized, it doesn't add value.. Can they convert a significant portion? Based on the historical data, there's not enough proof, hence I do not feel comfortable including that wishful thinking in my forecast.

I am looking forward to reading your views about the company and feel free to provide feedback regarding the analysis, that is always appreciated!",finance,1658058419

gaming,"Funniest ""Dodge"" animation I ever saw in a game","So I think we're all fairly familiar with how avoiding attacks work in turn-based RPGS. Some games will include a little animation of a character quickly jumping back or to the side if they manage to avoid an attack, while other games will literally just have their model do nothing as a little ""Miss!"" pops up in front of them. Low effort, but it still does the job.   
I was playing some obscure JRPG on the 3DS back when I was in high school. I forget the name, and I lost the cartridge so I can't go back to replay it, but I clearly remember one instance in the game that left me in tears.   
It was near the end of the game, on a map filled with high-level enemies and big monsters. The game was similar to Fire Emblem and FF Tactics in a sense that battles took place on large square maps, and your units moved like chess pieces. I moved 1 of my units to a spot thinking they would be safe, but failed to notice that a strong enemy was in attacking range. I initially panicked because there wasn't much left of the map and a majority of my best units had died, so I thought I would just have to restart the mission and play more carefully.   
Lo and behold, the monster walks right up to them and proceeds to let off a big attack. I remember it had some really complex animation of the monster grabbing the unit, breathing fire on them, jumping up in the air, then spiking them down on the ground to make a big crater. Watched the whole attack animation unfold and was ready to shut off the game and take a quick breather, only for the character to land on the ground as the ""Miss!"" appears and they shout a quip like ""Haha, you missed\~"".   
Instant laughing fit. I could not believe it. And the thing is similar stuff like this had happened at different parts of the game. I guess the attack animations worked in a way that even if the attack missed, the full animation would still play; A character could literally be engulfed in a huge, fiery explosion, only for their model to not move and they make some remark on how they're unharmed.",technology,1658067343

The article discusses that although IT spending overall will increase at a much smaller rate, cloud spending growth remains strong. And this is not a discretionary spend anymore. Takeaways? Expect continued strength in AWS/Azure. Secular tailwinds benefiting semiconductors businesses with focus on data-center (but not low end PC/tablet/smartphones). 

&gt; Companies world-wide are expected to ease up on information technology spending this year, as economic headwinds prompt IT chiefs to focus their budgets on subscription-based cloud software and services, according to chief information officers and industry analysts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Across the board, global spending this year on enterprise IT is projected to grow 3% year-over-year to a total of $4.53 trillion, Gartner Inc. said Thursday. That would mark a significant drawdown from an estimated 10.2% increase in 2021, the IT research and consulting firm said.**
&gt; 
&gt; Gartner said it expects spending this year to be tempered by a **steep decline in purchases of computers, laptops and tablets**. Their sales are projected to drop to a combined $767 billion from $808 billion in 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; The **net gains**, Gartner said, are being **driven by an anticipated $806.8 billion in spending on software, up 9.6% from last year**. As a measure of the growing share of business applications running in the cloud, Gartner said it expects **spending by cloud providers on new servers to grow 16.6%**, as they build out capacity in data-center facilities.
&gt; 
&gt; John David Lovelock, Gartner’s chief forecaster, said inflation, rising interest rates and market volatility are pushing CIOs to rent cloud-based IT infrastructure and software, which offer the advantage of spreading out costs through ongoing subscriptions, rather than lump-sum purchases.
&gt; 
&gt; Cloud computing is one of the few areas where IT spending is expected to outpace 2021, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the slowdown in overall spending, a serious reduction in IT budgets is unlikely, Mr. Lovelock added.
&gt; 
&gt; “A lot of this spending is no longer considered discretionary,” he said. “IT has moved to the front office to support revenue growth, and even generate revenue by monetizing new services.”
&gt; 
&gt; The longer-term outlook for IT budgets, measured as a percentage of company revenue, remains positive, Morgan Stanley said Thursday in a research note. It said **growth expectations for IT budgets this year continue to track closely with a 10-year, pre-Covid average of 4.1%.**
&gt; 
&gt; Morgan Stanley said cloud computing—along with cybersecurity and data analytics—in particular will continue to be top spending priorities for CIOs.
&gt; 
&gt; Gary Reiner, operating partner at investment firm General Atlantic and a former senior vice president and CIO of General Electric Co. , said enterprise software has traditionally remained resilient during periods of economic uncertainty.
&gt; 
&gt; That is in part because of the stickiness of long-term cloud subscription business models, “but also thanks to the immense value that these solutions can deliver to organizations,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Areas like cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and data analysis and storage will continue to be bolstered by long-term tailwinds and remain significant parts of enterprise IT budgets, Mr. Reiner said.",finance,1658072572

crypto,How difficult would it be for a modern tech to crack a custom cipher?,"Hi supposed I created a series of custom ciphers.

For example, supposed I encoded this phrase: ""who is Satoshi"" and a hacker finds this. Without them knowing what type of cipher or how anything about my encryption how likely is this to be cracked.

Lets say I did something weird like.

Enigma 4 ( custom scramble motors, Rotor 3 set to V, rotor 4 set II etc) this is then fed into a Ceasar cipher shift 9 ( a-&gt;j) which is then fed into another enigma 4 again with a combination of mix rotors and even plugboard.  the output in text is say something like.

""mouw ocuu lscs w""

Is this uncrackable?  again there is no knowledge of what type of cipher I used let a lone the combinations.

tldr: I guess the question really is, does chaining arbitrary ciphers make the code more secure? especially if the combination is only known to the individual.

That gives me $2,400/month to play with. Which is pretty close to those home price ranges.

personalfinance,Private loan refinance tips? Best companies?,"I'd like to refinance my private student loans away from Navient. I see rates are really great now, I have great credit, and a low debt to income ratio, so it seems like it's a good time, but I don't want to get tangled up with an company as shady as Navient.

Allow me a mini-vent about Navient in case anyone else is stuck with the bastards. They have been a total pain in the ass for years, even going so far as to not process my autopayments claiming the funds weren't available due to rate fluctuation when funds definitely were there \*many\* times over. How do I know I had the funds? I have a separate bank account dedicated to paying \*only\* those assholes and keep a chunk of our emergency funds in it. I swear they do this periodically to prevent me from removing my mom as the cosigner and I am done with them. For years I'd stuck it out hoping the class action lawsuit would go through, since I was lead to think I had no choice but to take deferral a couple of times. I doubt leaving would effect that now though and I'm sick of these jerks.  

Does anyone have any tips beyond just checking rates with each company? I know Sofi was really popular for awhile, but don't know if they still have a good reputation dealing with people. I'd like to have the ability to defer in case of an emergency without crazy penalties. Are those sites that check multiple rates a better way to see many rates at once or does that skew something? I assume if I refinance my wife won't be on the hook if something happens to me, since it's my loan and predated our marriage, but realized I could be wrong about that too. 

Would you go with a fixed rate now? I am scared of the rates going up again and losing out on what may be under 5% even if the variable is super low today. I figure I will pay the same amount I am to Navient at the higher rates at the lower interest rate just to shrink it faster. Anything else I need to know?",finance,1658090697
CryptoCurrency,"Kindof seems like the most of crypto ""loaning/collecting interest"" was just bs to fuel ponzi schemes","I'll acknowledge that there are probably legitimate reasons why someone would put up $1500 worth of Bitcoin, as collateral, to take out a $1000 loan of ethereum.

The concept never really made perfect sense to me, but I'll acknowledge there could be situations where you'd want to do that (ideally with a ***decentralized*** exchange).

However, it seems like the most popular use of the concept of ""crypto lending"", by far, was to justify what were, more or less, ponzi schemes like Voyager, Celsius, etc.

In the past, if a ponzi scheme promised you guaranteed 10%-20% returns, it would raise a huge red flag. How could such a thing be possible?

Bitconnect claimed to be able to deliver huge returns via its proprietary ""super sophisticated trading bot!"" To most people, that sounded like *obvious* bs. Anyone with a brain avoided Bitconnect.

However, with the advent of ""crypto lending"", groups like Voyager and Celsius could now claim to deliver 10%+ returns via ""collecting interest off of loans, **just like a bank!!**"" Sounds almost legitimate.

People were happy to believe that ""traditional banks"" were making insane 25%-50% returns from loaning out the money in your savings account, despite only giving you 0.1% interest, because **""banks are just greedy like that!""**

We now know that the only way Voyager and Celsius were able to offer those insane returns was by making even more insane bets, like buying DickButt NFTs and investing in obvious ponzi schemes that were offering even ***more*** insane returns (like Anchor Protocol).

So my point is that if you had always been wondering who all of these people were who were putting up huge collateral to borrow crypto, and then paying huge interest rate on top of that, you now have your answer: nobody.",cryptocurrency,1658092745

stocks,Bull case vs Bear case,"I wanted to create a list of all the current Bull vs Bear conditions in the current market, and figured I would post it here so people could add in suggestions:

**Bull Case**

* A good amount of damage has been done in markets this year, bringing things down to fair/under valued (based on TTM and Forward EPS estimates).
* Commodities look to have peaked, along with interest rate expectations, thereby signaling peak inflation (which is what started this whole thing).
* The job market is still strong, unemployment is low and there's still something like 1.9 open jobs for every person.
* The consumer is still strong and spending a lot of money. Their balance sheet is also healthy.
* No recession this year. A slowdown in growth appears certain, but not a recession. Given the recent decline, the market has more or less priced in the current situation.

**Bear Case**

* While there has been a good amount of damage done, markets are only ""fairly valued"" on forward EPS estimates that have not been revised down. 
* Commodities are still higher than pre-covid levels by a significant amount. Peak inflation doesn't mean we instantly go back to 2%. Inflation is sticky, and higher than 2% will have the Fed continue to raise rates. Inflation may slow to 4 or 5% which is still way too high. If they raise and pause rates like the 1970's bear market, it will be a volatile mess.
* Jobs are a lagging indicator, and things can change quickly.
* A strong consumer contributes to inflation, forcing the Fed to continue rate hikes until inflation is below 3% at the very least.
* Until we know what earnings look like, we can't estimate how deep the growth decline will be. It's safer to wait until earnings + forward guidance at the very least.",finance,1658100849

personalfinance,How to better optimize my money?,"I am currently a software engineer living in southern California making roughly 143K annually (excluding my stock options which I don't plan on selling).

Annually, I max out my 401K (with 50% match from employer) and my roth IRA (through backdoor). In addition, my employer offers after-tax contributions, so I am contributing 10% of my aftertax to another roth IRA (\~14K annually).

After state/federal taxes and my retirement account contributions, my take home is roughly 2.6K bi-weekly or 5.2K monthly. Now, for my expenses.

* Rent: 1000
   * After splitting with SO.
* Joint savings: 900
   * This is a saving account that my SO and I are contributing to (maybe wedding fund)?
* Personal savings: 300
* Food, groceries, entertainment: 1000
* Taxable brokerage: 1500 - 2000
   * This varies in case I end up spending more on entertainment, but I make it a goal for myself to always contribute at least 1.5K to a brokerage.

Within the next 5 years, I definitely want to set myself up to be able to purchase a home. All of the numbers above don't account for what my SO is making (except for rent), so I'm trying to over-optimize by considering my SO's income as a ""nice-to-have backup"". Although they'll be contributing as well, I like the extra security blanket. Based on my research, I know it's not recommended to put money that'll be used for a security deposit in a taxable brokerage account, so I'm currently seeking advice on how I can better allocate my money.

My ""emergency fund"" currently sits at 40K and this is a lot more than I want. It's at such a large sum because I recently switch jobs and I just put all of my sign-on bonus here. Eventually, I'd want to move maybe \~10K into a brokerage account (for context, I only invest in index funds like VTI). 

So, what's on my mind right now? Every pay check, I'm contributing $150 into my personal savings, which is my emergency fund. It's at a very high amount right now, so I don't think it's really necessary. I was thinking of just contributing to a ""housing fund"" or something (basically just another HYSA). In addition, I'm curious if I'm ""over-saving"" but putting 10% of my after-tax money into a Roth IRA (mega backdoor). If I reduce that 10% to 5%, I could in-turn be contributing $500 per paycheck into this ""housing fund"" which would net me 13K annually.

Bitcoin,Don't hate on CEXes and regulations,"I find it sad to see so much hate against anything that is centralized.  In fact, CEXes are the reason why Bitcoin is where it is. And CEXes are also why bitcoin might rise much higher yet. Here is why.

Bitcoin is merely a storage of value, like gold. It is no answer to banking on its own. Majority of successful businesses today start with an investment by an external entity. And any such lending needs a risk assessment on a case-to-case basis, which cannot be built into bitcoin by itself. What would YOU prefer: sitting on your excess money, or letting it be borrowed to help someone's investment as long as you know that it is safe to do so, and you also get some percentage of interest in return? This is what banks do, and this is what exchanges ""try to"" do too. Sorry, but there is no way to ""decentralize"" this vital part of banking because of the associated risk assesment factor.

Then Celcius tried this. But they effed up. They didn't back up their lending by sufficient bitcoin because they got greedy. What is the solution? Transparency and regulations. And if you hate your govt to the extent that you hate the entire concept of regulations, then you have become an opponent of democracy itself. This is what a government is meant to do, and this is what WE are supposed to make it accountable for, through our vote.

A capitalist country is built both by its competing corporations (including individual businesses) and its governments. Riling against regulations and centralized corporations in the name of some ""decentralization"" is both anti-democratic and anti-capitalist. Regulations, by the way, also include breaking up overtly big corporations, including banks, so that there are none that are too big to fail or enforce a monopoly and destroy competition. Its our responsibility to demand this from our govt in return for our votes. But unfortunately vote entirely on guns or abortion or LGBTQAnon or what not. This is completely on us, guys. And then we wonder why the most corrupt of us end up as our leaders.

There was no bitcoin a little over a decade ago. Did we ask people to stack all their cash in lockers at homes back then, and only take some out when it had to be transferred? This ""not-your-key-not-your-crypto"" argument is weird, and it sidelines the real problem: insufficient regulations on exchanges.",cryptocurrency,1658112614

stocks,8/10/22 Tell yo' friends,"TLDR: CPI in August is doom or boom.

The CPI numbers for June were higher than expected and the market dipped.  Suddenly a 1% rate hike was on the table, but Fed officials affirmed maintaining 0.75% for their next meeting (July 27/28) and the market rallied.

By not going for a 1% hike, the Fed is calling peak inflation.

The next two weeks there will be a moderate rally, followed by fear selling before the next CPI release.

8/10/22 is the next CPI release.  If inflation dips the market is going ape shit and you'll see articles about a possible soft landing.  If not, things get really tricky.  

The next Fed meeting is 9/20 to 9/21. The Fed doesn't want to drop the hammer because midterm elections are in November, but if they don't the next meeting isn't until November 1st and 2nd - way too late to stop inflation and political suicide at the same time.

So where's that leave us?  8/10/22 CPI is probably the most critical financial day this year.

personalfinance,How to best tackle our student loan debt and set ourselves up for success.,"My fiancé and I will be getting married next summer and I am just starting out making 55000 a year, where my take home pay alternates between 1900 and 1750 about every two weeks. She will be a nurse when she graduates in the spring and so she’ll be looking at a decent salary (and possibly a nice signing bonus?). I am currently living with my parents and my only expenses per pay period are $100 for gas, $150 for food, and what amounts to about $100 in recurring payments that hit at different times of the month (Spotify, game pass, cat food, vet care plan, and my medication), plus any down payments I have to make on wedding vendors and a new set of tires I need to put on my car (paid off) in the next month. At first, my plan was to aggressively build my savings for the wedding and emergencies while maxing out my IRA and possibly looking into a down payment for a house towards the end of our first year together. The problem is, while I graduated with only two loans, one of which is no interest and the other is only about 6000 dollars, my fiancé will be finishing with 80-90k in debt. 

About 70k of that is made up of parent PLUS loans, which have interest rates up to 7.08% that concern me. Before I sat down to really dig into our finances, it was just assumed that her family would take out the full $11000ish dollars again each of her final two semesters at the current rate of 7.54% interest. My fiancé has about $10k across all her accounts currently, and her subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans should cover most if not all of her tuition. She’ll need money to cover rent (about 8000 for the academic year, paid monthly), living expenses, and a learning software subscription ($1000) along with any school supplies (I also want her to be able to go out and have a good senior year with her friends so I want her to be comfortable). We’ve discussed and think it might be better for her to forgo these two last loans and I can send her part of my paycheck each period if she’s running low on funds. If nothing else, we could ride out this fall semester and then she can borrow in the spring if it’s looking like she’s gonna need more than I can provide. Does this sound like a good move?

While that is going on, I have also begun putting away between 800-1000 dollars of each paycheck to eliminate the loans with the highest interest. My question: do each of these loans come with a minimum payment when she graduates or will each servicer only ask for one to pay down her total balances with them? She has 6 parent plus loans and a mix of 9 subsidized and unsubsidized loans, so keeping track of all of them simultaneously seems like a lot.

A small side note: I’d like to still be able to put some money away for retirement and emergencies, and I’m not even sure if I’m over reacting or not when it comes to the 7+% interest. Also, I know that the house is a ways off now, but if anyone has any tips for preparing for home ownership or opinions on renting an apartment vs. investing in a condo feel free to chime in.

stocks,(7/18) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a frrrrrrrrrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, July 18th, 2022-

*****

# [Dow futures jump more than 200 points to start week as Goldman earnings top expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures rose sharply Monday as Goldman Sachs kicked off a busy week of earnings on Wall Street with a report that topped expectations.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 286 points, or 0.92%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.84%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.99%.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as investors anticipate a slew of major earnings this week. Shares of Goldman Sachs popped 3% in the premarket after the investment bank reported an earnings beat on the top and bottom lines. The firm’s fixed income traders generated about $700 million more revenue than expected.
*****
&gt; Bank of America reported quarterly revenue that beat analyst expectations, though the stock was down slightly in the premarket. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley kicked off the season for big banks last week, posting mixed quarterly results.
*****
&gt; “We anticipate volatility to remain elevated as the market toggles between pricing recession risk and soft landing probabilities with each piece of data,” Citi’s Scott Chronert said in a recent note.
*****
&gt; IBM will post results after the closing bell.
*****
&gt; Other major earnings on the docket this week include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Netflix, Lockheed Martin, Tesla, United Airlines, Union Pacific, Verizon and a host of other companies.
*****
&gt; Despite the growing recession fears, S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to post a 4.2% increase in second-quarter profit, according to consensus analyst estimates gathered by FactSet. S&amp;P 500 members are also expected to post a 10.2% increase in revenue for the period, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Profit expectations for the full year are still high with S&amp;P 500 companies estimated to post a 9.9% earnings increase for 2022, estimates collected by FactSet show.
*****
&gt; Futures on Monday also got a boost after Boeing shares gained more than 3% on news that Delta Air Lines was buying 100 737 Max 10 planes.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off a losing week, despite a Friday relief rally that saw the Dow jump more than 650 points. The 30-stock benchmark shed 0.16% on the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.93% and 1.57%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Friday’s relief rally came as traders bet that the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive than feared at its upcoming meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the central bank is on track to lift interest rates by 75 basis points at its meeting later this month. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius also said in an overnight note that he expected the Fed to raise rates by 0.75 percentage point.
*****
&gt; Still, it was the second negative week in the last three for all the major averages. Recession fears have been front and center in recent weeks as market participants worry that aggressive action from the Fed — in an effort to tame decades-high inflation — will ultimately tip the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; “Markets are likely to remain volatile in the coming months and trade based on hopes and fears about economic growth and inflation,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a recent note to clients.
*****
&gt; “A more durable improvement in market sentiment is unlikely until there is a consistent decline both in headline and in core inflation readings to reassure investors that the threat of entrenched price rises is passing,” he added.
*****
&gt; A batch of economic data drove last week’s wild market action. Inflation jumped 9.1% in June, a hotter-than-expected reading and the largest increase since 1981. That, in turn, led traders to bet that the Fed could raise rates by a full percentage point at its meeting at the end of July.
*****
&gt; By the end of the week, however, some of those fears retreated on the back of a strong retail sales number as well as comments from some Fed officials.

I'm currently banking online and am considering moving to a local credit union - the only problem is, there are at least five within a few miles of my home.

My question is this: what should I be looking for in a good credit union? Because they're all local, there aren't a ton of reviews that I can look at, and not all of them have the clearest information in their websites.

Obviously, fees associated with checking or savings accounts are a major point of concern. But how much stock should I put in things like their interest rates on loans?

Basically, what are the most important things to consider when choosing a credit union? Are there major pitfalls that come along with using them?",finance,1658154697

personalfinance,AMEX credit card debt and savings - what should I do?,"I have about \~24K in unsecured credit card debt with American Express. They are charging me an insane APR (at about 30% even though I have no late fees or anything) so I am paying about $400 in interest per month. They are refusing to allow me to transfer my debt to another card with 0 APR and essentially are telling me that I am shit out of luck.

I have 10K in a savings account and stocks and market funds. I refuse to touch my index funds or stocks because I want to hold on to them. 

Should I transfer my 10K from savings to pay off the debt? Is there a personal loan or anything I can do to NOT pay an interest rate on the debt so I can focus on paying it off?

Any advice is appreciated!

EDIT: I appreciate everyone’s feedback regarding what it means to carry debt at a high APR even if you have savings- I’m just financing cash when I could focus on paying off debt and saving. I’m very bad with money but I am learning!!

Here is what I came up with:
- I had a discover card that had $0 debt on it and there was an 0 APR offer for 10 months. I transferred 9K of my AMEX debt to this card. I had set up auto payments of $900 for 10 months on this card.
- I was given a financial relief offer from AMEX that entails the following: Program is for 12 months. I am enrolled in $380 monthly auto payments but I can make additional payments as needed. My APR is at 5.99%. I can make purchases. My spending limit is decreased down to the debt amount (so it goes from 30K to 24K which hurts my credit score but not enough that it matters).
- I will transfer 5-8K from savings account to AMEX card to further lower debt

I will be making auto payments on both accounts and additionally making an extra monthly payment on AMEX to pay off debt fully in 10 months. I will have to practice budgeting for the first time in my life but I think it’s time to step up my financial game because it feels as if I have been hemorrhaging money.

dogecoin,Does anyone else feel like they haven’t financially benefited from any government policy created in response to the pandemic over the past two years?,"*Disclaimer* - This post is not to attack the poor or those who needed help during the pandemic. 

Federal government passes $6T+ in Covid related spending over the past two years. Fed drops rates to 0 fueling an asset boom. Yet no spending bills or policy the government has passed since the pandemic started two years ago has really helped people in a similar situation like myself at all. 

Not the target demographic to benefit from any of them. Not rich enough to benefit from asset appreciation but also not poor enough to get substantial assistance like rental assistance. While also having a stable job throughout so no PPP payments or unemployment income. Not a business owner so no huge PPP or SBA loans that were forgiven. Also not a homeowner so no housing boom or deferred mortgage payments. Also don’t have children so no tax credit or extra stimulus for them.

personalfinance,Should I take out public student loans to pay off private student loans?,"I am a married graduate student. An advisor recommended that I consider taking another student loan from the government to pay off preexisting private loans. Is this a wise choice?

Snapshot of our finances:
* Monthly income - ~$4,100
* Monthly expenses (incl. savings) - ~$3,600


**Private** student loans (that I could pay off with a public loan):
* Loan #1 - $434.62 (10.125% int)
* Loan #2 - $5,343.94 (8.125% int)
* Loan #3 - $6,602.09 (4.25% int)
* Loan #4 - $9,516.94 (7.50% int)

The **public** loan I am being offered:  
$20,500 (6.54% int + a 1.057% loan origination fee). 

When I graduate, I expect to work for a public institution that qualifies for public service loan forgiveness after 10 years (though I am not sure whether I will still owe anything at that point). I expect that my partner and I will each earn salaries around $70,000 - $80,000 (total household income should be between $140,000 - $160,000). 

It seems like it might make sense to take my advisor's advice and take the government loan to pay off a couple of the private loans with higher interest rates, especially since public student loans are not currently accumulating interest (and since the Dept. of Education [may soon limit capitalization on student loans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2022/07/11/biden-proposes-to-lower-interest-on-student-loans/?sh=25f40cad24d4)).

solar,Double checking a solar system my parents are about to sign,"UPDATE: Added more finance details

Hey everyone,

I wanted to double-check a solar system my parents (both in their 70s) are about to sign a contract for. My initial impression is that they are being rushed through the process on account of interest rates rising, and as such have three days to sign or lose the current financing option. This system is the best (per kWh) of the three they had people quote and the only one to provide 100% usage, so if the numbers are decent and the system is a quality one, I have no problem taking it on when I inevitably take over responsibility for the house. The only detail that irks me is that as certain details have changed (originally a new roof was being financed but I have since gotten that taken care of via homeowner's insurance) the company installing/financing the system has changed. Originally it was Sunlight Financial and now it is Powur.

&amp;#x200B;

* Region: Montgomery County, Pennsylvania
* Company: Sunlight Financial, and Powur (Del Mar, California)
* Panels: REC Alpha 400 (BOB) - 66
* Number of panels: 52
* Inverter: Enphase
* Warranty: 30 years
* Solar system size: 20.800kw DC (should be 101% of avg yearly usage)
* Est 1 year production: 23,266 kWh
* Cash price of system is $54,860.63
* Total price of system due to contractor: $75,151.55
* Finance Charge: $15,241.33
* APR: 1.49% (reduced from 1.99% for paying by ACH)
* Loan term: 300 months
* Solar loan payment per month: $224.81 (if we apply federal solar investment tax credit)
* Voluntary Federal tax credit payment: $19,539 (they DO have have enough income to gett 100% of credit the first year)
* Total payments over 25 years: $90,392.88

Those are all the key details on the contract they were given to sign but please let me know if there are any other details I should get for comparison. I understand interest rates are rising and the cost may go up slightly because of it, but if the net price tag of this is off I would rather find the right deal and worry about financing secondarily. I greatly appreciate any insight.",energy,1658160963

In 1981 Volker raised interest rates to 20% to kill 11% official US inflation at the time. .... We are now well past that mark. With the necessity of 20% interest rates minimum to begin to put a cap on the inflation.

The mitigating factors are

1. Keeping money velocity, workforce participation, and capacity utilization low; and they are all at current historic lows.

2. keeping taxes high to suck money out of the system.

3. Hoping beyond hell in the meantime that the US population doesn't riot in the streets.

investing,Ocean Freight Shipping Costs Are Driving Goods Prices Higher,"[This article by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/ocean-freight-shipping-costs-inflation) is a deep dive into the ocean freight logistics mess that is contributing to inflation.  The article says inland logistics problems are being exploited by dominant ocean carriers, who own the shipping containers, through detention (failure to return shipping containers) and demurrage (port storage from failure to pick up shipping containers) fees.  The carriers are blaming the importers (using the port as extra storage space since their warehouses are full) and trucking companies (shortage of drivers).  The marine ports themselves are partly to blame (e.g. containers can only be picked up or returned by appointment and a container can only be returned if they pick up another due to lack of space).  The containers can't be picked up until all fees are paid and after any customs inspections.  Congress approved a bill to give the Federal Maritime Commission more power over the shipping industry, and the commission has handed out some fines, but they're small compared to the industry's profits.

It seems like a real big mess but how accurate is the article?  Are the carriers mostly at fault here or is it everybody?  There's been a bunch of posts over the past year regarding the outlook of ocean freight and trucking equities but obviously fuel costs and HR shortages are factors.

Hi there, my husband trims our cat's claws every few weeks and noticed inflammation around one claw on the front paw.

(He is a white cat so it's easy to see the swelling) The skin around the claw is a little dry and pink, swollen around the claw. The root of the nail is a bit brownish and there is a yellowish crust around where the claw meets the skin. We suspect it's due to his nail being trimmed a bit too short last time (the quick has never been cut, just generally too short)

After soaking his foot in salt water the claw looks a little better- less red and some of the crust has come off. It's not actively oozing.  

I tried to take a photo but they all turned out blurry. I've looked at other pictures online of infected claws and it doesn't look as severe as those.

He isn't showing any outward signs of pain or irritation, no paw licking or limping. He was playing around and slapping the other cats just this morning with that paw. His temperature seems to be the same as the other cats, no warm ears or dry nose.

dot,The Bull Case for Composable Finance,"Many people are tangentially aware of Composable Finance. Here I wanted to share more information about Composable, and specifically lay out its bull case as a member of Composable’s team - and why it will change DeFi as we know it.

DeFi is complex - there are multiple chains, multiple layers, and multiple protocols you must choose from to execute a task. That complexity is part of what gives DeFi its value, but it also means DeFi requires a large learning curve.

Let’s say you want to get the best yield for liquidity provision, or the best rate for a loan. You may have to choose between different chains, different layers, and then the right protocol. You’ll also have to move liquidity across ecosystems and bridges to actually take out that loan, or enter that liquidity pool.

This is inefficient. In addition, it makes mass-adoption nearly impossible. But on the flipside, the inefficiency in setting, hunting and farming your yields across the different chains presents an opportunity for a lot more value - you can find better yield returns in DeFi than anywhere else.

What Composable has developed is modularly functional infrastructure through its technology stack, and the cross-chain virtual machine (called the XCVM). The XCVM enables you to build multi-chain smart contracts wherein developers can leverage the complexity of DeFi for its value, while abstracting the complexity itself away so users can actually use it. Composable ultimately acts as a top level orchestration layer that allows different chains to talk with one another. It unifies state transitions across virtual machines, and means one smart contract can sit on multiple chains.

As a result, developers can build apps that aggregate the best resources across chains. Users can now focus on what they want to do, instead of how to do it. Need to take out a loan? Composable’s XCVM means an app will let you get the best interest rate from across DeFi’s major ecosystems (Cosmos, Eth Layers 1s and 2s, etc).

Final result: the utility of cross-chain DeFi is maximized, liquidity across chains is optimized and used to overcome liquidity fragmentation, ecosystems are interoperable with each other instead of being siloed and in zero sum competition, and complexity is abstracted away so retail and institutional investors can actually use DeFi.

Composable has released [a ton of written content](https://composablefi.medium.com/) going into these different topics in-depth ([here](https://twitter.com/0xbrainjar/status/1542942837779714048?s=20&amp;t=_UpZw1WYaJdCRK72FkADrg)'s a live demo of the XCVM), and the team regularly does AMA’s where you can ask anything you’d like. I’ll be doing more follow up to share more information, and discuss the different details. Hope this was useful!",cryptocurrency,1658168465
stocks,"The stock market is poised for a summer relief rally driven by lower oil prices, no economic recession, and a rollover in inflation","[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-stock-market-is-poised-for-a-summer-relief-rally-driven-by-lower-oil-prices-no-economic-recession-and-a-rollover-in-inflation-stifel-says/ar-AAZHUZe?li=BBnb7Kz)

&amp;#x200B;

* **The stock market is poised for a 9% relief rally this summer as the economy avoids a recession, according to Stifel.**
* **The firm sees oil prices falling to as low as $75 per barrel, which will help cool down inflation.**
* **While Stifel sees a bullish set-up in the stock market right now, it still expects a bearish decade ahead.**

 

Investors should expect a sizable relief rally in US stocks this summer after the S&amp;P 500 fell into bear market territory earlier this year on rising inflation and slowing earnings growth expectations.

That's according to a Sunday note from Stifel's chief equity strategist Barry Bannister, who expects the S&amp;P 500 to jump at least 9% to 4,200 this summer. The relief rally will come to fruition if the economy avoids a recession over the next six to nine months, as Bannister expects.

""Recession fear is over-done,"" he said, adding that the key indicator to monitor for recession risk is the PMI manufacturing index. ""Recession question is whether we see PMI manufacturing closer to 40 than 50; our view is only a second half of 2022 slowdown at 50.""

The PMI manufacturing index is based on a survey that helps assess the economic activity of manufacturing companies. A reading of 50 is neutral, and anything above that signals ongoing growth in manufacturing activity.

Stifel's view that a recession isn't imminent doesn't sound like a stretch given that the US economy has added nearly 3 million jobs year-to-date and the unemployment rate remains below 4%. The job market tends to shows signs of deterioration leading up to an economic recession. 

And with no economic recession ahead, that means the earnings power of the S&amp;P 500 is likely to hold up better than investors expect, which should provide some valuation support for the index and its individual components.

Also helping drive a rebound in stock prices this summer will be a precipitous decline in oil prices, which should ultimately help cool down rising inflation and give the Federal Reserve more breathing room in the trajectory of its interest rate hikes.

That would be a big relief for investors, who digested another high inflation report last week with prices rising more than 9% in June, a 41-year record.

Bannister expects oil prices to fall to as low as $75 per barrel, which represents a potential decline of 24% from current levels. Oil prices have been on the decline since its early March peak of about $130 per barrel, but are still about double the levels seen throughout most of 2015 though 2020.

To position for the upcoming rally in stocks, he recommends investors rotate out of defensive stocks and into cyclical growth stocks, often found in the software, semiconductors, media and entertainment, technology hardware and retail sectors. 

While Bannister expects a rally in the short-term, he still thinks investors are poised to experience a lot of sideways chop, with a potential ""lost decade"" ahead. But that type of trading activity can present big opportunities for traders.

""Although we believe a secular bear market began in 2022, those feature trading opportunities for a decade, such as the one we now see,"" Bannister said.",finance,1658168671

25m in Tech, Income is $180,000 per year gross, working for well known software company (not developer or sales) — Living in Boston MA. I purchased a 1 bedroom, 1 bath, 765 sq ft condo for $405,000 back in September 2021. Put $40,000 down, mortgage balance is currently sitting at around $356,000. Interest rate locked in at 2.9% (put 10% down, conventional loan).

According to similar homes/condos being sold in my part of the city, as well as estimates on Redfin/Zillow, current appraisal of my property is right around $600,000. That means I could be sitting on close to $240,000 in equity. Others in this area also told me I got a great deal on my purchase, &amp; that the property is valued at a lot more than what I got it for. Seller was from out of state &amp; was trying to rid of it quick (sold to me within 2 days of being posted, for whatever reason).

My question is this: I want to buy something bigger —- 2 beds, 2 bath, around 1,000 sq ft. Homes/condos of those size in my area in Boston can cost anywhere from  $600,000-$850,000, meaning I’ll be needing at-least $75,000-$150,000 for a 10%-20% down payment (conventional loan) or $30,000-$50,000 for an FHA loan. I’ll be moving in with my girlfriend in the next 6-8 months &amp; rather than rent, I’d like to acquire another property for us to live in. Should I do a cash out refi, HELOC, Home Equity Loan or just sell, put the proceeds in a 1031 exchange &amp; acquire the next property like so?

Long term I want to build a real estate portfolio as I know it’s very profitable &amp; good to hold long term. My first choice is hold &amp; try to get enough cash for down payment w/out having to do any of the first 3 options but if they are too risky I’d just sell &amp; keep profits for the bigger place.

* Gross monthly HH income: ~$13k
* Monthly PITI: ~$2.5k
* Age: Both 32

**Background**: Wife and I got married in 2020 and bought a starter 3br/3ba ~1900 sq ft home for ~$380k at 3.125% (now worth ~$550k according to online estimates but that's very inflated imo). Now that we're thinking about starting a family, we're also thinking about our future home. We recently looked at a few model homes in the area with 3-4br/3ba ~2500-3000 sq ft with separate office, media room, game room, etc. However, currently new builds or less than 5 year old homes are in the $750-800k range. With high property tax rates in Texas and our area, the total PITI estimates to be about ~$5k per month at the current ~5.5% rate. 

We initially thought we could start with this and then transition into a bigger home when the time came, but we're nervous of getting priced out from rising home prices as Dallas continues to grow and attract big companies and coastal city residents. At the same time, talks of looming recession and rising interest rates could spell even more price decreases, so if we buy now-ish or before the end of the year, it could look ugly on paper for a couple of years if real estate does crash ~15%+. On the other hand, if we're living there for 5+ years, then this is a moot point since the value should stabilize or return to what we bought it and then some. 

**Situation in question**: We currently have enough money for a down payment on the new home as well as some emergency savings backed up, so we're considering 2 options: 

*Option 1*: Upgrade to the new home and rent out our current home

* Pros: Low interest rate, low PITI (~$2200) which would be optimal for renting out (need to research more but minimum $2800+ in our opinion)
* Cons: Time, energy, market/tenant risks, plus learning how to manage ourselves and/or pay a property manager

*Option 2*: Sell our current home 

* Pros: Less risks, more cash on hand to save or invest (extra down payment or extra monthly payments)
* Cons: Less return(??), losing the ability to fall back to our smaller home if necessary, e.g. unable to have children, not wanting or being able to afford the bigger home in the future, in which case we'd just max retirement and savings to retire earlier lol. 

Of course, if we had a time machine, we shoulda woulda coulda bought a bigger house in 2020 and locked in the low price and rate. Sigh, it probably woulda only been a little over ~$3-3.5k for PITI per month back then but I digress. 

**Extra questions:**

1. What are the other factors I might be missing when looking at option 1 vs option 2? 
2. Will home prices in fact go down, especially in somewhere like Dallas? Will interest rates go up? This is mostly guesswork, and I guess that translates to the tradeoff in home prices/buying power if interest rates continue to go up to curb inflation. Only time and hindsight will tell if we timed the market correctly, right? 
3. Also, do home prices for new builds typically go down in a recession? A couple of the model homes are offering $20-30k incentives as buying has slowed down dramatically but some others say the price won't change much if any because of the ""backlog of prospective buyers.""
4. Is the best payout for a rental property only after 30 years when you outright own it? Or are there any other points that are favorable as the owner/seller? I'm thinking early 2022 was favorable to cash out at the top and then maybe in a couple years when the market dips to get back in. That's basically having to time the market correctly twice as well as having a backup option for housing in the meantime. 

Anyway, I just wanted to get some feedback and making sure I'm considering everything before we get more serious in the coming months. We're still waiting on the sidelines to see how things go for another 2-3 months at least. Thanks in advance.",finance,1658180272
personalfinance,Never pay off your mortgage...this is crazy right?,"There's a [viral video](https://www.tiktok.com/@janet.mckenna.lowry/video/7120627860938738987?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1) on TikTok going around where a woman explains why you should never pay off your mortgage. She claims there are federal protections for people who have home loans, and you lose those protections if you pay off your house. Instead, she says pay your mortgage down to a few bucks a month so you maintain those protections. She points to this article to back her up. [https://www.edelmanfinancialengines.com/education/home-mortgage/pay-off-mortgage/](https://www.edelmanfinancialengines.com/education/home-mortgage/pay-off-mortgage/)

Mortgages are fixed monthly payments so paying off principal doesn't bring down your monthly payments, and you can be foreclosed on if you have a mortgage.

personalfinance,"For anyone who has used the Velocity Banking/ Chunking method, how was your experience? what would you have done differently?","I have been looking at the chunking method for a brief time. In principal, it makes sense to me. You pay large chunks of the mortgage at chosen intervals using a line of credit. Then, you use your income to (ideally) fully pay off your line of credit each month. This next part is a little difficult to explain without a visualization so I'll do my best... Imagine you are fully funded for at least one month into the future. You have a $2500 line of credit, a $5000/ month income, and a $5000/ month regular expenses (includes budgeting for future savings and $500/ month mortgage payment. This is HYPOTHETICAL so the amounts are arbitrary. I'm just using these numbers for easy math). 

You pay $2000 from the line of credit toward your mortgage in January. Let's call the unused $500 of the available credit ""reserve credit."" Your income in January is $5k. Remember you are fully funded for an entire month so your assets look like this:

1 month fully funded savings - $5000
January income - $5000
Line of Credit - $2500

For a total of $12,500 

 You pay off the card completely, which leaves you with 3.5k in savings (1.5k went to pay off card), 2.5k in potential credit, and 4.5k that you intend to live off of in January (500 went to pay off card, and was normally considered your mortgage payment). Of the 2k you used to pay off the card, $500 must now be considered reserve credit until you are ready to pay the next chunk. So, your new total reserve credit is $1000 at the end of January.

In February, you use 1.5k of the card to cover expenses because 1k is locked up in reserve credit for your next chunk. Again, of your 5k income, you budget 500 toward the card as reserve credit/ typical mortgage payment. You use your income in February to pay off the remaining 1k on the card. Then you use 1k of the card in March, $500 of the card in April...

If you repeat this process for the next 3 months (4 months total per cycle), your amount of reserve credit will be $2500 at the end of a cycle, which is the original amount of available credit with which you started. Repeating this process, you would deliver a new chunk payment toward your mortgage of $2000 and in four months, your reserve credit will be back to its original state. You would do this 3 times a year in this scenario for $6000 toward your mortgage, the same as if you made the regular $500 a month. The goal of this method is to pay less interest and pay the principal down faster. It would work because you're paying off the card in full every month. If you cannot afford to pay off the card in full every month, it would still work because the principal on the card is so much lower than your mortgage that even the higher interest rate wouldn't matter as long as you pay it off within a month or so.

Am I missing anything? Some things I still need to consider is that some lenders will not let you pay with a credit card. Also, some lenders require a monthly payment, right? So chunking may only work if you can afford to also make your regular mortgage payments.

Not married to this idea at all, just trying to make sure I UNDERSTAND it fully before accepting or rejecting it.

Trading,Is the crypto market ready to rebound?,"While rising interest rates and weakening sentiment has hit cryptocurrencies hard this year, the market may be showing signs of a bottom after managing to consolidate within a range for the past few weeks. 

Following the Terra crash and Celsius bankruptcy, a lot of the bad news has possibly already been priced-in. Bitcoin’s break above $22K on elevated volume is a positive sign, and could be an indication of strong demand around the current levels. 

However, Bitcoin’s rally on Monday stalled right around the 200-week MA, and the possibility for a larger rebound in the crypto market will likely depend on whether sentiment can remain positive and help BTC break this key level. 

There is still a lot of potential downside due to the prospect of an even more hawkish Fed and intensifying recession concerns. A shift back to risk-off trading could see BTC face rejection from its 200-week line, potentially putting the broader market on track for a retest of the recent lows. 

All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see if the market can build on its recent advance, or if it was just a brief correction before another move lower.",finance,1658223175

One thing which I realised for crypto is this:

Typically when inflation happens, nominal interest rates follow to maintain the real interest rate spread for assets. When I look at equities as an example in an inflationary environment, I guage the ""real"" return vs.the equity risk premia. 

However with crypto, because there's no underlying earnings on these tokens I feel crypto is more susceptible to nominal rates rise so its ""beta"" is a lot worse than equities as an example. In layman terms, in an inflationary environment, crypto underperforms other asset classes and outperforms on the flipside. (Yeah I know about crypto acting as a hedge against inflation etc etc). 

Is my thinking correct, happy to be challenged. Because of the challenges to do fundamental analyses of crypto projects and tokens, I am hoping for experts' opinions on some insights.",cryptocurrency,1658230224

personalfinance,What to do with the unexpected equity in our house? Remodels vs purchasing investment properties etc.,"So a little bit of background. My wife and I purchased our first home about 3 weeks prior to Covid shutdowns in 2019. The house we are living in currently appreciated about $140,000 from what we paid. It is also in a desirable location, and I very much enjoy where we live BUT I am also 28 and still have a desire to go somewhere else for a couple of years before we have kids and understand that I have been blessed with a great job that has allowed me some cushion to start planning and investing early. So with all that said these are some ideas I have been toying around with for the past couple of weeks but need some advice, input, pros and cons of each, really anything you have to add or suggest, let me know. Hell, even tell me my ideas are stupid for all I care. Here are some ideas I have been going back and forth on.

We have roughly $160,000 in home equity with a 2.5% fixed interest rate. 

There is a house for sale down at the beach that we could afford IF we put down $140,000. After speaking with a loan advisor, he stated we could take out a loan against our equity for the down payment on a beach house, while renting out our current house. Current rental market for something similar to our house is around $3000 and our mortgage is roughly $2050. The risks I see are with the equity loan being close to what we have in the house so if the markets pull back I’d imagine that would leave us in a bad spot BUT the area we are looking for a beach house does allow it to become rentals if we decide to move back, and historically, even pre covid, the area has become very sought after. So idea one is to buy a beach house, move there full time for 2-3 years while renting out our current house.

Option 2, and probably the option that makes the most sense, is to take out a home credit loan, renovate the bathrooms of our current house, get some of the larger repairs that need to be done completed, finish the basement (maybe), and in general, make the place our maybe forever home (or at least the home we are going to raise kids in). Also, I have an older car I drive as a daily driver that needs probably $10,000 more of work to make it a true daily driver for the next 8 years… toyed with the idea of using some the credit for that. The car has appreciated significantly so in a bind I could sell if for about $20,000 more than what I paid for it.

Option 3 - take out a loan against the equity for an investment property (found a duplex in a desired area) to rent out and work on saving money up for the jobs around our current house. 

I know that’s a lot to unpack but any advice is greatly appreciated. Let me know if you need clarification on anything also.

# [Stock futures rise after Monday’s Dow reversal as a busy earnings week continues](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/18/stock-futures-are-flat-after-dow-reverses-course-to-start-busy-earnings-week.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as traders pored through more corporate earnings reports a day after the market failed to sustain a sharp rally.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 164 points, or 0.53%. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked up 0.68%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.72%.
*****
&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, although the pharmaceutical giant also cut its full-year revenue and profit guidance. Hasbro’s revenue for the previous quarter came in a tad below expectations, while the toymaker’s earnings per share beat a Refinitiv forecast.
*****
&gt; Netflix is set to report after the close Tuesday. Later in the week, Tesla, United Airlines, American Airlines, Snap, Twitter and Verizon are among those scheduled to report.
*****
&gt; IBM shares fell 5% in the premarket, after the tech company lowered its forecast for cash flow, even while reporting earnings that beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; So far, roughly 8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported calendar second-quarter earnings. Of those companies, about two-thirds have beaten analyst expectations, FactSet data shows.
*****
&gt; “When we think about earnings and we think about where stocks are now, we think there’s upside simply because there may be overpricing of this recession that some people think is imminent or already upon us,” said Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, during Monday’s Fast Money on CNBC.
*****
&gt; # Dow reversal
On Monday, the Dow shed more than 200 points to end the day in the red, reversing a morning rally fueled by solid earnings reports from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. Oil broke above $100 a barrel, and b/itcoin surged to the highest levels seen since mid-June.
*****
&gt; Late in Monday’s session, stocks were dragged down on a Bloomberg report that Apple would slow hiring and spending on growth next year to prepare for a potential economic downturn. Shares of the iPhone maker ended the day about 2.1% lower.
*****
&gt; The news came as traders weigh the potential for a U.S. recession, especially as inflation remains at multidecade highs and the Federal Reserve raises rates to curb said inflationary pressures.

Nevermind that he stole the primaries from Bernie Sanders a second time.

https://youtu.be/tdnxeijbffA?t=162

Even the Guardian concedes the point.

&gt;**There are three clear examples.**

&gt;First, Biden’s support for finance over working-class Americans. **His career was bankrolled by the credit card industry**. He delivered for it by spearheading a bankruptcy bill that made it harder for Americans to reduce their debts and helped cause the financial crisis. He not only authored and voted for that bill, he split with Barack Obama and led the battle to vote down Democratic amendments.

&gt;Second, healthcare. On 25 April, the day he announced his campaign, Biden went straight to a fundraiser co-hosted by the chief executive of a major health insurance corporation. He refuses to sign a pledge to reject money from insurance and pharma execs and continues to raise money from healthcare industry donors. **His campaign is being bankrolled by a super Pac run by healthcare lobbyists.**
What did all these donors get? A healthcare proposal that preserves the power of the insurance industry and leaves 10 million Americans uninsured.

&gt;Third, climate change. **Biden signed a pledge not to take money from the fossil fuel industry, then broke his promise.** Right after a CNN town hall on climate change, he held a fundraiser hosted by the founder of a fossil fuel conglomerate. He is pushing climate policy that has gotten dismal reviews from several leading environmental groups.

https://archive.ph/m3eDy

Let's not forget that Biden insider-turned-whistleblower, Tony Bobulinski, submitted thousands of pages into evidence that included direct testimony, financial records, text messages, emails, documents and audio recordings. **The Senate has confirmed Bobulinski’s evidence as genuine.**

Politico admits it, as well.

&gt;""**at least some of the alleged laptop material is genuine — as well as other emerging evidence** about the deals family members have sought or received from people with an interest in influencing Biden.""

According to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, **the Vice President's office and State Department officials were aware but ignored concerns relating to Hunter Biden's role on the board of a Ukrainian Burisma.**

https://i.redd.it/e0dsor2soxb91.png

https://i.redd.it/v7otkzeqbec91.png

https://i.redd.it/i8me6gwdhrb91.jpg

In 2016, Ukraine's top anti-corruption prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, had an active and ongoing investigation into Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. At the time, Hunter Biden continued to serve on Burisma's board of directors. According to news reports, then Vice-President Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine's leaders did not dismiss [Shokin]''. After that, Ukraine's Parliament fired Shokin.

https://youtu.be/azLKK0xTOFI?t=14

Secretary of State, **John Kerry falsely claimed he had no knowledge about Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma.**

Joe Biden’s compromising partnership with the Communist Party of China runs via Yang Jiechi (CPC’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission). YANG met frequently with BIDEN during his tenure at the Chinese embassy in Washington. Biden’s foreign policy stance towards China (formerly hawkish), has since turned positive. Ukraine has received billions, where oligarchs have been caught with massive amounts of cash, far in excess of what the US spends on it's own citizens.

Joe Biden gravely endangered and harmed the security of the United States and its institutions of government. Through blatant nepotism, he enabled his son to influence foreign policy and 
financially benefit as a result of his role as Vice President. He supported his son engaging in collusion with Chinese Communist Party-linked officials.

Joe Biden allowed his son to trade appointments with his father and other high-ranking administration officials in exchange for financial compensation. He permitted his son to take money from Russian oligarchs, including Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.

&gt;government officials flagged concerns about potential conflicts of interest and that the former vice president's son's financial interests with foreign governments ""accelerated"" during the administration of former President Barack Obama.

Hunter Biden has also participated in this corruption and, even now, the 2021 annual report shows Skaneateles is still listed as a “shareholder” with a 10% stake in the Chinese Firm benefiting from strategic oil reserves in the US.

Frank Biden, another very troubled individual, is also in on the scam, involving himself in corruption and US policy as is financially convenient.

Alana Biden runs cover as producer at NBC News and has dabbled in a little lite voter fraud.

- Frank Biden is linked to a little known consulting firm that was involved with lobbying both the Obama admin (DoD) &amp; Congress in 2016. The LLC was titled the Delmarva Group, a consulting firm that was involved with federal lobbying on behalf of an oil distribution company during the last year of the Obama administration.

- Hunter opened a bank account with Gongwen Dong to “fund a $100,000 spending spree” with his uncle and aunt, James and Sara Biden, who also received $1.4 million from Hunter’s firm

- In addition to over $4 million from Burisma, Hunter Biden and his family received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds. There is ongoing FBI investigation into Hunter Biden's laptop revealed that Hunter received a 2.8 carat diamond gift from a high-ranking Chinese official in 2017.

https://i.redd.it/gsa9cxqwfgc91.png

- Hunter Biden had business associations with Ye Jianming, founder of the CEFC China Energy Company, Ltd., Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to the Communist government and the People's Liberation Army. Those associations resulted in millions of dollars in cash flow. 

- Hunter Biden paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an ""Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring''.

- On June 23, 2011, Sean Conlon, a business associate of Hunter Biden, suggested that a $10 billion deal could be struck in exchange for certain persons meeting Vice President Biden, showing deliberate 'pay-for-play' and 'quid-pro-quo''.

Let me know how soon we can do that. V brief. If Nagi get that done we get more bonds to move. Regards your hard working partner in Positano! Sean''

- Emails between Hunter Biden and his cousin reveal that the President of Hunter's Chinese Communist Party-linked firm, Eric Schwerin, repeatedly asked Hunter for an appointment to the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad--a position he ultimately received. The email from Hunter to his cousin, Missy, regarding the request for the appointment to the Commission is as follows:

&gt;Eric asked for one of these [an appointment] the day after the election in 2008. You know better than me what are real and interesting appointments. Let's go through the list with Steve and see what makes sense. I don't know how much 2016 and nepotism plays into it.'

Former CIA Agent John Sipher says he was proud to sway the election away from Trump with the “Hunter Biden Laptop Letter”. He is also a fellow at The Atlantic Council, of which Burisma was a 250k a year donor. You do the math.

#There is Massive Electoral Fraud Occurring

In order to stay in power, the Biden regime is simply stealing elections, including the primaries.

It starts at the fundraising level, where bad actors manipulate the financial side of things.

supporters.  The electronic voting company went from a small technology startup to a market player in just a few years, catapulted by its participation in the August 2004 recall referendum.  Smartmatic has claimed to be of U.S. origin, but its true owners -- probably elite Venezuelans of several political strains -- remain hidden behind a web of holding companies in the Netherlands and Barbados.  The Smartmatic machines used in Venezuela are widely suspected of, though never proven conclusively to be, susceptible to fraud.

#Jan 6 Was A Staged Media Narrative To Cover For The Stolen Election

Objectively comparing the Jan 6 incident with the BLM riots, and we see a clear double standard in reporting.

https://i.redd.it/7984w3os3gc91.png

&gt; 1. **Plainclothes militants.** Militant, aggressive men in Donald Trump and MAGA gear at a front police line at the base of the temporary presidential inaugural platform;
&gt; 2. **Agents-provocateurs.** Scattered groups of men exhorting the marchers to gather closely and tightly toward the center of the outside of the Capitol building and prevent them from leaving;
&gt; 3. **Fake Trump protesters.** A few young men wearing Trump or MAGA hats backwards and who did not fit in with the rest of the crowd in terms of their actions and demeanor, whom I presumed to be Antifa or other leftist agitators; and
&gt; **Disciplined, uniformed column of attackers.** A column of organized, disciplined men, wearing similar but not identical camouflage uniforms and black gear, some with helmets and GoPro cameras or wearing subdued Punisher skull patches.

&gt;Internal email reveals day before Jan 6 riot, US Capitol Police intel unit warned ""BLM from Baltimore"" was bussing in rioters: ""BLM/Antif will wear MAGA hats, wear camo,and attempt to blend in with MAGA crowd"" so violence blamed on Trump supporters attending Trump rally.

#The Shill/Astroturfing Response

The standard response of shills have been:

**I. Crying about Trump.** The crybabies dishonestly attempt to insert ""false equivalency"" and ""slide"" arguments regarding Trump or Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner. They are off topic responses designed to limit discussion on Biden corruption.

**II. Crying that Hunter Biden did not hold office.** Voicemails, email, business transactions, wiring transfer orders, text messages and news reporting all confirm that Hunter Biden is involved in policy, domestic and abroad, bribery, domestic and abroad, and is involved with US defense contractors and works under Bohai Harvest specifically for the interest of China's state owned interests, where the interest is specifically stated (with pictures) that China wants American resources. Hunter Biden is a traitor. Hunter Biden sees no problem selling out a billion in US tax payer dollars for a few night with crack and hookers. Hunter Biden sees no problem selling out American resources to China for a few nights with crack and hookers.

**III. Focusing on Hunter Biden's genitals.** We understand that the unemployed moderators and jannies across the Internet are gay. They are obsessed with Hunter Biden's private parts. They use this to distract from the corruption, because they are desperate to defend a drug addled pedo because they religiously serve a political agenda that seeks to enslave the world with authoritarianism. Because these mods and jannies have no leg to stand to defend this, they project and accuse fervent researchers of wanting to look at Hunter Biden dick pics.

**IV. State actors are pushing disinformation and misinformation.**  There are 3 pictures that have been making the rounds that are intentional disinformation:

1) Natalie Biden with cocaine on her nose. It's not Natalie. Sure, it's a striking resemblance, but it's verified as being a cam girl. The shills use this to say ""the data is fake"" but, really, their argument is what's fake. Anyone with the data knows this picture isn't real.

2) Joe Biden with asian girl. This is actually a BDSM video from xvideos that has been around for years. The face of the old man is clearly visible in portions of the video and is, in fact, not Joe Biden. Shills love to use this type of disinfo to muddy the waters.

3) Hunter Biden with five young girls. This is not Hunter Biden, as Hunter Biden has never sported a black soul patch. Shills are using this to poison the well and distract from the corruption.

Other tactics, in this realm, include misnaming Natalie as Hallie, misnaming Zoe as Natalie and intentionally getting facts wrong to confuse everyone so that they can them claim falsehoods are being spread around as an excuse to censor information.

**V. Blatant Censorship.** Suppression is occurring where the news is ignoring the data. The news is in on it, showing that they can't be trusted and serve the liberal agenda. Big Tech is also in on it. But outright bans, deletions, harassment and death threats are happening to people who share the most damning stuff. This is why it is important to saturate the Internet with proof.

#Shill Groups

**1) Paid actors:** One group is upvotes.club. They aren't politically aligned, they merely get paid. Reddit accounts are bought and sold, upvotes and downvotes are bought and sold. Posts and comments are bought and sold. This group operates on many platforms.

**2) Political Actors:** ""Correct the Record"" was doxxed in John Podesta's emails and Shareblue was the bigger, badder replacement. American Independent, PACRONYM and other shill groups exist that engage in these behaviors, participating in, what amounts to, a giant RICO scheme.

**3) State Actors and their contractors.** Mossad has been heavily involved in suppressing Hunter Biden data, as well as the Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein issues. They even create cut outs that work for US Intelligence and make fake threat reports to villainize people who want to share information about political corruption in the US. SITE Intelligence Group, for example, pretends to be ""online extremists"" to justify censorship and submit threat reports on their own astroturfing to the US Government painting certain groups as ""domestic terrorists"". In fact, SITE Intelligence Group are  foreign terrorists who have weaponized the Internet against Americans.

#What About Jared Kushner?

Shills love ""Whataboutisms"", invoking off topic, old news as a form of strawman argument that has zero relevance to the topic they are attacking.

Either way, I think you will find most Trump voters are not a fan of Jared Kushner. 

The ""Alt-Right"" consider Kushner an Israeli spy.

&gt;Donald Trump’s Jewish son-in-law and Israeli spy Jared Kushner is reportedly involved in the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus situation. That’s at least according to the Jewish media, which is detailing how the Jew Kushner was soliciting suggestions on how to handle the crisis.

https://archive.ph/rmCak

The conspiracy community labeled him a secret society weirdo long before he married Ivanka. This nuked thread explains that he is the head of the Illuminati. https://archive.ph/vT0FQ

So... what about Kushner? Nobody likes him and nobody would cry if he was locked up; probably not even Trump, himself.

In fact, Jared Kushner and Hunter Biden are perfectly aligned in their interest in virus intelligence via Metabiota, EcoHealth Alliance and the PREDICT Program that started it all.

&gt;With this in mind, the PREDICT team has leveraged the veterinary resources at the Smithsonian to unveil potentially devastating diseases that have not yet entered the human population. Their efforts, which span the fields of wildlife conservation and global public health, bolster the world’s growing arsenal against infectious disease. PREDICT is funded by USAID, and brings together a bevy of global health-minded organizations including the Smithsonian Institution, the One Health Institute at the University of California at Davis, EcoHealth Alliance, Metabiota and the Wildlife Conservation Society.

We explored building a DADU in the backyard for me to live in while our kid is still young, but construction cost estimates were coming in at $350k, and we only have $220k equity in our home (owe $530k, it's worth $750k) and couldn't find a lender willing to do it based on future value. 

I'm still on the mortgage but not making any payments. Mortgage payment is $3k and my ex has a renter in the upstairs ADU paying $1200, so her net payment is $1800, which she can easily handle on her own (we each make $110k). Since I paid half the mortgage for the first two years and supplied all of the down payment ($40k), our divorce agreement stipulated a 50/50 equity split upon sale someday, and also that I have the right to ask her to sell with 120 days notice.

This all seemed satisfactory at first, but after 6 months in a $2k apartment, I'm feeling very limited by having my credit and cash all tied up in the house. I want to buy a small condo but almost surely can't while still being on the mortgage. I don't want to ask her to sell, and I don't want her to cash-out refinance to pay me off, since the 2.8% interest rate we have is spectacular.

So does that leave us with loan assumption only? I highly doubt she'd qualify on her own for a $530k mortgage on $110k income. Can you count rental income in a loan assumption? If my ex were to succeed with an assumption, would our divorce agreement stipulating that I get paid back someday still be legally valid?

Life is expensive and with emergency room visits for the pets, random things that pop ups, and misc charges my wife and I have accrued about 20k in credit card debt spread out over 5 credit cards with varying interest rates and we make about 6800 a month together and we are paying $1000 a month to the IRS for taxes.

Right now the plan is to pay the minimum on the 4 lowest interest cards and a nice chunk on the largest interest and balance card, till its paid off and move to the next one.

All of our bills are auto drafted from out checking accounts and we use most of what's left over to pay the credit cards.

Would it be a horrible idea to instead of auto drafting the bills from our checking account, instead put them on the credit card we are currently focusing on and using the money we would have spent on the bills to pay off a larger chunk of the credit card debt and cycle through the old charges that are accruing interest till the card is paid off and then have all of our monthly bills moved to the next card we are focusing on?

Example, we have $2685 in bills each month that include rent, dog food, internet, etc. and we currently pay $1300 towards the main credit card. Would it be better to continue doing this or to put the $2685 on the credit card and pay $3985 each month towards it?

Rent rates are going through the roof and we're already outgrowing our space.

So I've been working on my credit, sticking to a budget, and have about 2 months of safety net savings so far. I've been working through the page wiki's.

My credit isn't great, and at this point it's mostly from one car loan that I missed A LOT of payments on. I planned to have one baby, went completely blind into maternity leave planning, one baby turned into 3 and we nearly ended up homeless. But now I'm uterus-free with an advanced degree, with guaranteed but modest income for the next 3-4 years and high earning potential after that. 

Brass tax:
I'll be on the mortgage hunt with hopefully a 620 credit score, between 50k-100k down, income around $35-40k (depending on my adjunct schedule, my salary is $27k and I adjunct a few classes a semester on top of that). Houses in the area we're looking at start around $250k right now, and that's about the top of our budget if we can get approved.

Not including husband on the mortgage because his credit is shite and he's currently in school, not working.

What should I be watching out for with the housing market? Are there any indicators I can keep an eye on for when interest rates might drop? When housing prices might increase or drop?  Any market speculators I can follow? 

Any other tips or insights to help us get into a better position to buy? Our lease is up in April and ideally we'd move into our new home around that time, but waiting until summer may be an option, though I expect our rent will increase dramatically for May based on comps.",finance,1658277121

personalfinance,Credit cards keep getting closed?,"Hi,
I have a 4 credit cards, and i’m in a lot of debt. Around $14k. In order to help pay it off quicker, I started using Family Credit Management Services. I’m thinking that maybe that has something to do with it, since I just submitted my first payment to them last week. It’s not a loan, but they negotiate lower interest rates with my credit companies and I pay them monthly.

I’ve never missed a payment, and none of my cards have been maxed out. The debt also isn’t super old, the oldest of it is from December. But yesterday, I went to make a payment on my Chase card, and it’s like I never even had an account. They didn’t email me or anything. I tried using the card on a small purchase too, and it declined. Then today, Discover emailed me to tell me that they were closing my account too. I have high balances (~2,500 each, not maxed out) on both. 

I’m assuming that I still have to pay it, but i’m so confused as to why they would do that? I plan on contacting them soon, I just won’t have the opportunity for a few days. Has anyone ever experienced this happening?",finance,1658284153

personalfinance,Apartment Charging for “VIP” Parking,"Preface: This is about as first-world problem as you can get, but I wanted to check if anyone has beat the system.

Moved into some luxury-esque apartments in North Dallas (rent ~1650). There is a gated parking garage attached to the building for the building residents. Before moving in, I specifically asked if parking has been an issue and they said no. They  also said they would not charge for parking in the garage. Fast forward a few months, and now they are putting up “VIP” parking signs on every floor. VIP parking is sold at a first come first save basis for $50/month. Roughly there are 10 VIP spots for every 15 normal spots. That seems fine, but if you leave after 5 PM you will not be able to find any parking on your floor when you return. Additionally, 2-3 people on each floor will leave their broken/WIP motorcycles in normal spots so they are essentially reserved.

I know luxury apartments means luxury payments, but I feel like 50$ is egregious when there never used to be issues before this system was implemented. Also, a resident recently broke our gate and there was some car parts stolen within the garage. Just fed up that there are break ins happening, but they still want 50$ for good parking.

Is my frustration justified? Can I leverage the breakin stuff and get free parking?",finance,1658287602
stocks,Cathie Wood’s Ark Shutters Transparency ETF in First Closure,"Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-19/cathie-wood-s-ark-shutters-transparency-etf-in-first-closure

Cathie Wood is closing down one of her exchange-traded funds, the first time her Ark Investment Management has pulled the plug on an ETF. 

The St. Petersburg, Florida-based firm is shutting down its ARK Transparency ETF (CTRU), which launched at the end of last year, according to a regulatory filing. With holdings like Teladoc Health Inc. and Spotify Technology SA, the fund aimed to invest in companies that received high scores on transparency. 

Ark said in a statement that Transparency Global, which shaped the fund’s underlying portfolio, will stop calculating the index at the end of July.

“While Ark investigated alternative index providers, it did not find a suitable solution and decided to close the fund,” according to the release.

The fund gained only $12 million in assets since inception, a fraction of the $9 billion in Wood’s flagship fund. It was a rare passive vehicle from Ark, whose active offerings boomed in popularity during the pandemic, with Wood hand-picking stocks that she saw as shaping the future of finance, healthcare and other industries. 

“This seemed like an odd fit to me from the beginning,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, an investment adviser. “Ark made their name by focusing on active management and disruptive innovation. The ARK Transparency ETF was at odds with that approach.”

The transparency fund’s price has dropped more than 30% since its debut in late December. It will no longer accept creation orders after Thursday and won’t accept redemption orders after July 26, the filing showed. 

It’s been a difficult year for investors in growth strategies. Wood’s ARKK has plunged more than 50% as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and fears of a recession grow. Since December, Ark has lost almost half of its assets under management.",finance,1658291693

I have about $20k in student loan debt at an interest rate of 2.5% and a mortgage of $140k at a rate of 2.9%. My mortgage is up for renewal in January 2025. 

Originally I was planning to pay off my student loan first and use that minimum payment towards savings/annual mortgage prepayments. However, I’ve realized just how much I’m paying per month in interest on my mortgage. 

I’ve familiarized myself with the debt avalanche/snowball methods. My question is this: should I prioritize payments towards my mortgage, rather than paying off my loan ASAP, to minimize interest costs in the long run? It seems more effective to reduce the amount of cash I’m paying in interest on my mortgage sooner? 

I would still plan to put $5k towards my loan annually to pay it off (I realize I’m not about to get rid of my mortgage in a few years lol) but want to make sure I’m maximizing my cash in the long run.",finance,1658306243

news,Mortgage demand drops to a 22-year low as higher interest rates and inflation crush homebuyers,,finance,1658320475
stocks,Mortgage demand drops to a 22-year low as higher interest rates and inflation crush homebuyers,"* Surging inflation and interest rates are hammering American consumers and weighing on the housing market.

* Mortgage demand fell last week, hitting the lowest point since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

* Buyers have lost considerable purchasing power as rates have almost doubled since earlier this year.



The pain in the mortgage market is only getting worse as higher interest rates and inflation hammer American consumers.

Mortgage demand fell more than 6% last week compared with the previous week, hitting the lowest level since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 7% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week in 2021. Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they’ve lost considerable purchasing power.

“Purchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,” said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.

While buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.

Demand for refinances, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4% for the week and were 80% lower than the same week last year. Those applications are also at a 22-year low, but the drop in demand from homebuyers caused the refinance share of mortgage activity to increase to 31.4% of total applications from 30.8% the previous week.

Mortgage interest rates haven’t moved much this week, but that could change very soon due to increasing bond market volatility. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by another 75 basis points next week, and other central banks are taking similar action against inflation. A basis point equals 0.01%.

“This is especially true next week as markets digest the newest Fed policy announcement next Wednesday, but Thursday’s policy announcement from the European Central Bank could also cause enough of a stir to impact U.S. rates,” noted Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily.

investing,Mortgage demand drops to a 22-year low as higher interest rates and inflation crush homebuyers,"* Surging inflation and interest rates are hammering American consumers and weighing on the housing market.

* Mortgage demand fell last week, hitting the lowest point since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

* Buyers have lost considerable purchasing power as rates have almost doubled since earlier this year.



The pain in the mortgage market is only getting worse as higher interest rates and inflation hammer American consumers.

Mortgage demand fell more than 6% last week compared with the previous week, hitting the lowest level since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 7% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week in 2021. Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they’ve lost considerable purchasing power.

“Purchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,” said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.

While buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.

Demand for refinances, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4% for the week and were 80% lower than the same week last year. Those applications are also at a 22-year low, but the drop in demand from homebuyers caused the refinance share of mortgage activity to increase to 31.4% of total applications from 30.8% the previous week.

Mortgage interest rates haven’t moved much this week, but that could change very soon due to increasing bond market volatility. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by another 75 basis points next week, and other central banks are taking similar action against inflation. A basis point equals 0.01%.

“This is especially true next week as markets digest the newest Fed policy announcement next Wednesday, but Thursday’s policy announcement from the European Central Bank could also cause enough of a stir to impact U.S. rates,” noted Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily.

Any thoughts or criticism on this data point? 

Another thing to consider is both commodities and bonds have signalled peak inflation, and Fed rate hike expectations are anchored.

personalfinance,Mortage advice: Down payment vs Once-off lump sum,"I'm about to take a mortgage for my first appartment, and playing with lump sum calculators I found some things that were a bit insteresting to me regarding strategies towards paying it and saving money. Assume there are no taxes and/or other hidden costs, and that I can manage the monthly repayment just fine (it would actually be around 30% of what I earn monthly). Just for your information, I live in Peru, so I don't know if things change that much regarding the info I got from the housin wiki in this subreddit.

(All fixed rate mortgages)


* Appartment price: S/243,000

* Loan amount: S/218,700
* Interest rate: 8%
* Once-off lump sum repayment: S/116,200

I don't understand why the first option is actually saving me more money and time, given that I'm using the same amount of money just in a different way. It seems that the outcomes are way more different than I thought and maybe there is some better or hidden way for saving even more money? For example, what if I chose a shorter loan term (10 or 5 years), or what if I made a bigger or smaller lump sum repayment? Is there an optimal way of calculating these things? Because I'm super lost and I would like to get some help with it. Thanks a lot.",finance,1658325288
personalfinance,Question about paying off extra on my mortgage,"So I saw a tik tok (please don't hate that's why I'm here) about if you pay mid-month an extra 16% off your mortgage premium every month it could cut your payment time down by like 10 years.

I, of course, didn't save the tik tok bc I see ""pay off your mortgage early with this one hack"" like 7 times a day, so I can't go back and investigate further, but I have been thinking about it and thought I'd ask if there was any merit to that. For me 16% would only be an extra $250/m which is very doable in my current budget. Tried to google the answer, but it was a lot of ads and untrustworthy sources.

If that is utter BS any advice on paying off my mortgage faster/more efficiently is welcome!

Thanks.

personalfinance,"Advice - some credit card debt, opening a joint checking and savings account, and a small windfall","Hello! I'm hoping to get any advice on how to proceed from my current situation. Seriously, I won’t be offended if you explain it like I’m 5. If you think it’s obvious, share it anyways - strong chance I don’t know it. I would generally consider myself to be pretty smart, but I swear, when people start talking about personal finance, all I’m hearing is the Charlie Brown teacher. I’ve used the same bank since I got my first job at 16. My two credit cards are a discover card (shoutout to them for being the only company that would give my no credit, 18yo self a card) and a chase card (because I travel frequently). I probably only have my 401(k) in a good spot thanks to my employer offering it. I set it to take out a certain percent, and then I just try to forget about it. I really don’t know what to do with retirement savings outside of this 401(k). I promise I've read about IRAs, but it just goes over my head. 

I followed the personal income flow chart on the wiki, but I still have questions. My partner and I have a budget for shared expenses, and I have a personal budget. We each have at least a one month emergency fund set to the side. 

The background: my partner and I are in our early 30s. We own a condo. We let our budget slip the last year or so, and we have ended up with more credit card debt than I’m comfortable with (aka we can’t pay it off with what’s in our checking accounts at the moment). We can dig ourselves out of the credit card debt in about 4 months on our own, so it’s not the worst thing in the world. Plus we have a small windfall from a settlement on the horizon - after expenses we will incur from short term living arrangements + paying off credit card debt, we should have about $25,000 left from said windfall. 

All of our money is separate at this time- no joint checking or savings at this time. Currently, I pay most of the bills upfront, and he sends me his portion via Zelle. It’s not an ideal situation, so we worked up a budget that will have us each contributing a certain percent of our paycheck to a joint account to cover all shared expenses. We think we’ll take some money from the windfall to start this joint account. I’ve read all the pros and cons of bank account vs credit union, and I still can’t decide what’s best for us - feel free to share your opinions. 

After that, we’re currently deciding between paying off our car (3.9% interest rate) or put it in a savings account to start the base of our emergency fund. I know the car is considered low interest, but I have this mental block of hating all debt- it took me a while to get over this for a mortgage. If we go the emergency fund route (which is what we are leaning towards), with the budget we have put together, we could grow the savings account to a full 6 months of shared expenses in 1 year, and to a full 6 months of income in 2 years. While we are leaning towards the emergency fund, I’d love feedback on if that’s the right choice. If so, any advice on which savings account to use? From what I’ve gathered while googling, all I know is that it should have a high APY.  

All of our budget is based on take home salary not including bonuses. We both get bonuses - mine is quarterly and typically makes up about 20% of my yearly income, while his is monthly and typically makes up about 40% of his yearly income. Our bonuses + what we have leftover from monthly income should put us close to even for our individual yearly totals. Since our emergency fund plan is in place, what should I do with the extra I save personally? Should it be a normal savings account or should I figure out what CDs are or something else? I’m still totally lost on understanding IRAs. If anyone wants to share advice on a beginner’s guide to the stock market, please do. I’m curious about when/how to get started, and how much money I should have upfront. 

Maybe I'm just overthinking all of this, but I feel like I am way behind my peers on my understanding of personal finances. Should I hire a financial advisor? 

**Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!!!**

**TL;DR:**

* Basics covered - budget created, 401(k) in good shape, 1 month savings set aside, small windfall on the horizon.
* Setting up joint checking and savings - credit union or bank? 
* Pay off car loan (3.9% interest) or put small windfall in savings account. Probably savings, but I hate the idea of any debt, so I'm looking for reassurance that it's the right choice.
* What to do with remaining personal savings (outside of joint account)?
* Any advice for a total beginner to the stock market? When/how to start and how much money to have upfront?",finance,1658329655

personalfinance,Should taking out a car loan followed by a mortgage within a year be avoided at all cost?,"Title pretty much sums it up. I'm finding myself in a situation where I need a car for work. I was also planning on purchasing a condo in the area that I've been renting in, within a year after my current lease ends. The realtor that I've been working with is making it seem like it would be the end of the world if I was to take out a car loan before I was to apply for a mortgage. Is he being dramatic, or should this be avoided?

Would an existing loan effect only my purchasing power, or would it also effect my interest rate, etc? I have stellar credit (800+), a solid income (220-300k), and would be able to afford a solid down payment for both the car and the condo. 

I realize buying a car in cash would be the smartest thing, but I'm just curious how badly having a car loan would effect my mortgage numbers should I decide to do it.

According to the Atlanta Fed, GDPnow, it's looking pretty certain that the GDP is going to come in negative.  That would make for two back to back quarters of negative GDP growth.  This would indicate a **technical** recession (an official recession is of course determined by the NBER).  By the streets metrics though, two consecutive negative GDP quarters signals slowing growth and the entry to a recession.  Just curious what others thoughts on the impact this will have on sentiment and markets when this is confirmed (or possibly not) next week.

personalfinance,Student Loan Default Remediation Question,"Hey all, looking for some advice.  Apologies for the rambling/stream of consciousness delivery. 

My wife apparently defaulted on some student loans when she was in her early 20s.  The fed garnished her tax return in 2018 and the two accounts on the TransUnion (or maybe it was Equifax) tab of her Credit Karma then showed closed/paid in full.  The other tab, however, shows 2 accounts that are closed, but show unpaid balances.  There are no other details (opened date, closed date, monthly payment, etc.  literally no other details aside from a contact number for the dept. of education that leads nowhere).  My wife doesn't remember how many loans were taken out 12 years ago, but has no reason to believe these are fraudulent.  Apparently the fed stopped garnishing returns, making collection efforts, etc. in 2019 due to COVID.  My wife, bless her heart, took this lack of additional garnishment and Credit Karma showing $0 in student loans as confirmation that she was in the clear (obviously not the most diligent in reviewing credit reports, etc., so please save me from your comments there as, believe me, I know).  Now she wants to go back to school and after completing her FAFSA the school reached out stating she was ineligible for student aid because she has unpaid student loans.

A few questions for you all:

1)  Does this seem legit?  It feels like it, but the accounts having no information other than a phone number that doesn't work seems a little sketchy.

2)  If it is legit, what are her options to get these out of default so that she can apply for financial aid?  I assume the only two are pay them off in full, which isn't practical right now or find a consolidation loan and go that route?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  Not looking for any type of pity as this appears entirely brought on by a younger, immature, irresponsible version of my wife, but just looking to help her get out of this mess so she can go back to school.

* No credit, student, or auto debt, car has low miles

* ~$9,000 remaining on loan for roof replacement at 6.99% fixed

* $109,000 remaining on $150k home loan at 5.5% fixed 30yr

* Home Estimate Value $190k-$205k

* Loan/LOC amount needed - $10,000 for exterior damage repairs, floor replacement not covered by insurance and improvements via new concrete patio area. If I can get a lower interest rate I would take $19,000 and consolidate the roof loan. I wouldn't be doing all the home renovations at once, it'd be spaced over the next 6-12 months so I could manage things to where the LOC never exceeds $10,000 of utilization.

There was a 36.2% probability that we will see a 100 bps hike.  This would suggest that the market is pricing in 75 bps.   Of course only time will tell.

I settled on Bank of America/Merrill based on lack of fees + cash bonus + banking and credit card rewards. Really, I was on the hook and reeled in - all they had to do was put me in the boat. But they did not.

I signed up for the IRA accounts and that was not too bad. It took some back and forth with them to verify identify with documents, but they were able to increase the cash bonus offer. I opened a checking account and that was painless. But then I applied for Bank of America’s unlimited cash back credit card, and things went sideways. I didn’t get an instant approval, which is unusual because I have 800+ credit, but maybe there was some data issue due to my recent job change. After a week, there was no response, just a status of “pending” on their website. After two weeks, I reached out to my Merrill rep and after another day or so of investigating she concluded there was nothing she could do to move this forward. It’s now 20 days after I applied, and still no answer about what’s going on with my credit application. I’m fed up. If this is how their bank handles me as a prospective client, I don’t want to see what happens when they actually have custody of my money.

Am I being too demanding here? Should I just STFU and wait for them to get around to giving me a credit card? Usually banks are doing backflips to put a credit card in my hand as fast as possible, so this experience is very new.

Also does anybody recommend any other brokerages with low fees + cash bonus + banking/credit card perks? I am looking at E-Trade now because they have a similar cash bonus and I like Morgan Stanley’s investment insights.

personalfinance,How much will Co-Signer's high credit score impact Borrower's interest rate?,"Background:
Over the last decade, I've (gladly) taken on the role of ""Other Mother-Acting Abuela (OMAA)"" to a neighbor, a now-18yo young woman. Dad is absent, and Mom is..uh..well..*there*,  but not much more, has few resources, and a history of financial (and other) instability.

Her daughter, however, is a really good kid - A/B honor roll all through school, has worked consistently since age 15, and saved and paid 5k cash for her first car by herself.

A couple of months ago, she traded in that first car for 1k  and put an additional 3k cash down for a nice little Honda Civic - which, two weeks later,  before she even got her permanent plates - someone hit and totaled (not her fault).

Unfortunately, as 18yo's do (and because she ""didn't want to bother"" me), she decided to be ""independent"", went to a ""buy here, pay here"" car lot, and trusted them to have her interests at heart - so ended up over-spending *and* over-paying for the Honda. 

The result is that, even with 1100.00 from the insurance settlement, she lost 4k+ (over 5k after tax, doc fee, 795.00 gap ins, title/tags, etc) and now is left with only a little over 2k in the bank. only half of which should go toward another car - which she absolutely needs, as we live in a rural area with no public transportation.

I have been taking her to work and back 3-4 days/wk, but I have wrist injuries so really need to get her in another car ASAP - preferably through a private sale, as it's generally a better deal.

While I have located an available 1200.00 daily driver, I'm not sure it's a good gamble, so am looking at other options in the 3k - 5k range.

Dh and I are retired and our income is from retirement accounts. Although we have the resources to just buy a car in that range and owner-finance for her, to do so would effectively raise our income (annual IRA withdrawal total), which, in turn, would raise my health insurance rates (I am under 65, so am insured through ACA, and premiums are tied to income).

In addition, I would not be able to report to a credit agency on her behalf, which is important.

Our credit score is around 815. Hers, due to very little credit history and probably age, too, is currently around 618.

The interest rate on her loan for the Honda was an appalling 18%, so I am hoping that if we cosign a small, short-term, private-seller auto loan (1k down, 2500-4k loan, 24 months max), we can get her a good interest rate.

Can anyone tell me how much impact our credit score would have, as cosigners, or have any other ideas about how to approach this?

In case you're wondering, I trust this girl like my own flesh-and-blood daughter(s), and love her just like she's mine, so there's no use cautioning me against it🤗.

Thoughts?

Thank you!",finance,1658366628

Luckily, I have the financial wherewithal where this isn’t fatal-but will likely delay other life milestones (i.e. buying a house/condo).

Can someone gut check me on my strategy on how to handle this.

Current Income: 110k/year, take home 5228/month 
Future Income (i.e line of sight to a promotion in next six months): 130k
Rent/month: $2350 (yes it’s high-but in NYC and need access to my graduate school-paid for by company and my job)
The take-home is after my 401k contribution which is 6% (the match)-my company also has a pension I’m vested in. 
Age 26

Assets:

Brokerage Acct (all long term holdings so would be taxed at lower rate): 49k
Inherited IRA: 11800
Inherited ROTH (not subject to tax-from deceased mother): 22500
Retirement Accts: 84k

Debts:

SoFi Personal Loan: 35k @ 16.01% (YIKES)
AmEx Personal Loan: 15k @ 6.99%
Credit Card #1: 1400 @18%
Credit Card #2: 7.8k @0% through April 2023
Credit Card #3: 5k @18%, 15k @ 0% through April 2024
Credit Card #4: 2.7k @ 15% (not really “debt”-I pay it off monthly but might be a lower priority now)

Strategy: 

1) The key is to get rid of that 35k from SoFi. That interest rate is a killer. Thinking a combination of selling assets (and maybe a 401k loan? I think I’m a decent candidate to leverage it). Thoughts on which assets to sell? Roth IRA inherited is tempting but that tax free growth…
2) The two deferred credit cards come due during bonus season-typically 10-15k. Instead of saving it or doing something fun, I know where it will be going.
3) Suck it up and make some lifestyle modifications for the Amex loan and the other bits of debt.

economy,American psychiatrist diagnosed Putin,"James Fallon believes that the President of the Russian Federation is very dangerous, and in conditions when he is in danger of losing everything, he will be able to use nuclear weapons.

James Fallon has been closely following Vladimir Putin’s actions for several years in order to recreate the course of his thoughts on the decisions made, writes The insider. Psychiatrist, professor at the University of California Fallon specializes in psychopathic personality disorders. To make sure the diagnosis was correct, he spoke with the leaders of Ukraine, representatives of the leadership of Russia, Chechnya, Belarus and Germany, and also read everything he could find about the upbringing and formation of the Russian dictator.

“You can’t just see someone on TV and say ‘this is a psychopath’,” the psychiatrist emphasizes. “But, in my opinion, Putin did have important prerequisites for the development of the so-called cluster B personality disorders – the most dangerous ones, including psychopathy and narcissistic disorder personality”.

**What is psychopathy?**

To describe this disorder, Fallon uses the definition proposed by the American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley. In 1941, in The Mask of Sanity, he described the psychopath as a person who appears normal and does everything to maintain this illusion. However, all psychopaths are distinguished by low emotional empathy. All of them are manipulators, selfish and aggressors who cannot feel pity, remorse or guilt. At the same time, they are callous and put themselves above all. 

The psychiatrist notes that psychopaths are divided into primary and secondary. In the former, the development of pathology is due to a process called “epigenetic marking” and manifests itself already in the first years of life. Due to trauma and exposure to stress hormones, the regulation of key genes changes almost irreversibly, this affects hormones in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.

Changes in the psyche of secondary psychopaths, also called sociopaths, are caused by emotional, physical, sexual abuse or bullying, and are partly reversible.

The behavior of psychopaths of both types is very different: a sociopath knows that he is acting immorally, but cannot stop, a psychopath is sure that he is doing the right thing, believing that he is right.

“This is an integral trait of the personality of a true primary psychopath: he never doubts that he is doing the right thing,” says James Fallon. Putin”.

**What provokes the aggression of a psychopath?**

The psychiatrist emphasizes that psychopaths are always looking for weakness in their victims, it is she who provokes them. Not being able to experience emotions, they are able to read them, they are well versed in other people’s feelings, fears, triggers and desires. With this knowledge, psychopaths manipulate their victims into getting the desired reaction, money, sex, or simply reveling in a sense of control.

“Putin’s key method is to keep his opponents from getting stronger, to strike at their weakest moment,” Fallon notes. “Self-disciplined psychopaths have the patience to wait months, years, even 10 years, until their victim shows vulnerability.”

In addition to this, the Russian dictator can be attributed to malignant narcissists, and the features of a sadist also appear in him. “It just doesn’t get worse,” says the psychiatrist.

In his opinion, several traumas made Putin so: a difficult childhood, and then the collapse of the USSR, which led to the creation of an independent Ukraine. Hitler experienced something similar in his youth. In 2011, Putin saw Libyan dictator Gaddafi die in agony, cementing a deep fear of violent regime change.

“All the implicit has been revealed in the last few years, and especially brightly in the last few weeks until February 24,” notes James Fallon. “Putin, like Hitler, revealed his true nature, and it became clear that he was acting precisely as a psychopath, and not a sociopath and certainly not like a normal person with bad tendencies.”

The psychiatrist is sure that Vladimir Putin’s behavior shows signs of clouding his mind: from pompous narcissism, he moved on to paranoia and hostile unbalanced behavior. Probably degenerative processes are going on in his brain.

## What to expect from Putin?

Vladimir Putin used to be calm, cold and prudent in public, but now it is more difficult for him to control himself, this indicates that he is extremely dangerous. It is difficult to predict his decisions, as the Russian president is losing his adequacy.

Rebuffed in Ukraine, he may feel stumped, Fallon said. When confronted with resistance, psychopaths and aggressors get lost and may even take flight, but Putin has nowhere to run. Now he has stopped hiding his feelings and this makes him even more dangerous, since it is no longer necessary to maintain the image of a cold-blooded person.

Psychopaths are distinguished by the fact that they are ready to do anything to achieve the goal. Achieving his own, Putin willingly commits war crimes, and he is one step away from using tactical nuclear weapons.

“People with psychopathy can take a lot, but as soon as the stress becomes too strong or prolonged, if they end up cornered, they lose control of themselves,” the psychiatrist emphasizes. “It is impossible to predict when Putin will be at this point. But when it comes, he will either run away or want to tear everything down and go all the way.. It only seems like irrational behavior, but in reality he is just testing the limits, drop by drop, like any bully testing someone for weakness. Say, let’s try , but if it doesn’t work out, we will step back and say: “Oh no, all we wanted was the Donbass.”

## How to neutralize Putin?

Putin is a clear primary charismatic psychopath who does not intend to openly show anger. Such predators retreat. when they get a rebuff. But if you corner them, they will start to defend themselves in all available ways, says James Fallon.

In his opinion, the best tactic for dealing with psychopaths is gradual and constant pressure on Putin without sudden movements, so as not to provoke a nuclear war. Under these conditions, sooner or later he will definitely make a mistake.

“Now taking drastic, drastic measures is not the best way out,” the psychiatrist is sure.

Fallon believes that Putin is waiting for a misguided move from Ukraine that, in the eyes of most Russians, will give him the right to any response. To do this, he needs a massive strike from Ukraine on a Russian settlement, or some larger target.

At the same time, it is clear that Putin cannot win this war: the more support Ukraine receives, the weaker the support of the dictator himself in his entourage. In the end, one of the Russian generals will be able to tell him that it is impossible to do this. However, according to the psychiatrist, this will require another months of struggle.

“Based on my knowledge of military psychology, I think it’s worth showing Putin that the West will stop at nothing,” says Fallon. point where we can wipe you off the face of the earth. We don’t want to do it, but we can.”

Recall that earlier Dr. Kenneth Dekleva says Putin is in an “echo chamber”where he does not hear other opinions.

solar,Please convince me why solar makes sense. Help me see the light.,"US centric post: Every few years I look into solar to try and make it make sense. I just love the idea stopping fossil fuel use. The energy independence and supposed financial savings are a huge plus as well. But I just can't see the light.

Everyone wants to calculate payback period with solar-only installations by effectively assuming that you have good net metering. With solar only, you kind of become a solar generator that sells to the grid at some specific rate. With a good net-metering policy, these calculations can make sense, but if those change, it's kind of like buying panels for your provider since you can't run your house on them directly. Nothing guarantees that your net-metering provider will continue to have a good net metering policy even 3 or 5 years in the future. 

So if you use 1000 kWh / month and generate 1000 kWh / month, most calculations assume you pay nothing for electricity beyond connection fees. But if you are generating way more during the day than you are using, and none at night (when you are using more), then without a net metering policy, only your day-time electricity is being offset. That's going to usually be less than 1/2 of your total usage. It seems to me that this is a point of even more uncertainty than rising electricity prices.

(You're also effectively competing with utility-scale solar, which is cheaper per W to install, and benefits from things like vertical panels for more sunny hours and bifacial panels. That makes far more sense to me.)

If you can be sure net metering will stick around, if you have great state-level incentives, or if you have terrible electricity rates (like over $0.25-0.30/kWh, the vast minority of US states), then solar-only could be worth it. But otherwise, I fail to see what real benefits you get with solar-only.

To be able to avoid more of the utility's increasing rates regardless of their net metering policies, you seem to basically need solar + battery. It also gives you power when the grid is down and can really help with expensive TOU policies. The problem here is that home batteries are like $1000/kWh. EV batteries are maybe 1/3 of that? So a single 10 kWh battery costs like $10k (*with* the current US federal incentive). That provides enough power for a normal 25 kWh/day house for maybe 12 hours? A cloudy day during an outage and you run out of power. 

With an EV and some work servers we have been averaging 50 kWh/day in Texas. During an outage, I can charge my car during the day (if it's sunny) and turn off the servers and probably get that 10 hours of backup. I'd need to spend another $20k-$30k on batteries alone to really manage a full single day consistently (and for Texas, making a payback period of like 17 years!). It's really only good for long-term outages if you go into emergency mode. That's a lot of cash for keeping your fridge and your home's HVAC on. (Now give me a 30kWh home battery for $10k, and we might be on to something.)

personalfinance,Can we afford this new house?,"We already own a small (~1200sq ft) home but with a toddler and both of us working from home, we'd like to upgrade to a bigger (~2,000 sq ft) place.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/k9FVu1V) is a breakdown of our current budget vs budget with a new mortgage and a table that shows what the mortgage would cost as a percentage of our income.

We use YNAB for budgeting. The Immediate Obligations category includes things like utilities, life insurance, internet and Semi-Variable includes home/auto maintenance, gifts, medical etc. We put about 18% of our gross income to our 401ks.

I have $22k in student loans with the average variable interest rate at 3.34%. We've recently started aggressively paying it off ($1,400/mo. Previously paying $600, the min payment is around $170) and at the current rate, it will be gone in 2 years.

If we buy a new home, we will sell our current one. Conservatively, it will sell for $230k and there's $161k left on the mortgage. We live in a highly desirable area but not really a high cost of living one, so we don't anticipate any problems selling our current place. We'd like to use the profit to pay off the student loans---that's why the debt levels are so different in the linked table. Our only other debt is a $240 car payment that will be done in 2 years. Selling the home would also let us replenish our savings, which we plan to use for a 10% down payment on the new place. Separately, we have an emergency fund to cover about 4 months of both of us out of work.

The new home we are interested in, we could probably get for $365k. The interest rate would be around 5.7 (current home is at 3.375) and the monthly payment would be around $2,775...I put $2,900 on the table to be safe and figure we will get re-assessed anyways.

What are your thoughts? Can we afford this place? If not, what monthly payment can we afford?",finance,1658402471

Background:
29 years old - high income earner $200K+ (I am anticipating my income will continue to increase)
Single, no kids
No debt (other mortgage at 3.5% interest rate)
Maxing our IRA
Maxing out 401K
Have a taxable brokerage account for ‘short term investments’

I was advised that purchasing a LI policy with a death benefit would be advantage for me come retirement. The reason being, I would be able to live off of all of retirement accounts (401k, IRA, and other investments) and can use the death benefit payout for my legacy. LI would provide me more diversification and the death benefit is typically not taxed.

I’m reading mixed opinions on LI for young adults. Most info online advises it is not a good idea and the LI sales rep is taking advantage. I have read some things that advise this is a good idea for wealthy adults.

economy,We Are About to Experience an Absolutely Epic Housing Crash the Likes of Which America Has Never Seen Before,"What goes up must eventually come down, and we have just entered the “down” side of that equation. 

Over the past two years, home prices in the United States have gone up nearly 40 percent. Now mortgage rates are rising at a pace that is truly frightening, and they are likely to go even higher in the months ahead as the Federal Reserve continues to fight a relentless war against inflation. Needless to say, higher mortgage rates mean higher potential mortgage payments for prospective home buyers, and so millions of (more) Americans are being priced out of the marketplace right now. The only thing that is going to bring those buyers back into the marketplace is for home prices to go down, and that is already starting to happen in some areas of the nation.

We were already in a historic housing bubble heading into 2020, and over the past two years we have witnessed another housing bubble develop on top of the previous housing bubble.

Overall, home prices in the U.S. rose 37 percent between March 2020 and March 2022.

That is insane.

Of course incomes have not been going up as fast as home prices have. In fact, it is being reported that “home prices have gone up four times faster than incomes” over the past year…

Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas put the real estate industry on edge this spring after they published a paper titled Real-Time Market Monitoring Finds Signs of Brewing U.S. Housing Bubble. Why the renewed concern? To summarize - Over the past year alone, home prices have gone up four times faster than incomes. Simple economic theory, which dictates that neither home prices nor incomes can outgrow the other for very long, tells us that isn’t sustainable. https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2022/0329

The analysis conducted by Moody’s Analytics aimed to find out whether economic fundamentals, including local income levels, could support local home prices. On a national level, Moody’s Analytics finds U.S. home prices are “overvalued” by 24.7%. In other words, U.S. home prices are 24.7% higher than they would historically trade at given current income levels.

Does this mean that home prices will come down by 25 percent?

Well, it all depends on what the Federal Reserve chooses to do.

If the Fed decides to stop raising interest rates by the end of this year, the damage could potentially be minimized.

But if the Fed continues to raise interest rates throughout 2023, we are likely to see carnage that is unlike anything we have ever seen before.

The last time that average 30 year mortgage rates crossed the 6 percent threshold was just before the last housing crash…

Average 30-year mortgage rates have pushed to nearly 6.4%. The last time we saw mortgage rates over 6% was right before the housing crash of 2008. Until mid-April, mortgage rates were in the 4% to 5% range. Just one month ago, rates were 5.49%.

Lower-income homebuyers have already been priced out of the market by spiking mortgage rates. The houses that are selling tend to be in higher price ranges.

Officials at the Federal Reserve can see what is happening, but they consider taming inflation to be a much higher priority right now.

Pending sales plunged in June and the inventory of homes on the market jumped as mortgage rates continue to rapidly rise.

Pending home sales plunged by 16% year-over-year in June. This follows on the heels of a 12% drop in May and a 9% dip in April. June marked the 10th straight month of year-on-year declines in pending sales.  https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523104-air-hissing-out-of-housing-bubble-at-accelerating-pace

Some of the hottest markets in the country have started to cool off really fast.

For example, just look at what is happening in California…

The pace of California home sales plunged 21% in June from a year earlier as soaring mortgage rates took a bite out of buyer interest, the state Realtors group reported Monday.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-18/california-home-sales-plunge-21-as-soaring-mortgage-rates-hit

And what we are witnessing in Boise is really alarming.

Boise was once one of the hottest markets in the entire nation, but now sales are dropping fast 

Before governors relaxed stay-at-home orders two years ago, white-collar professionals were already fleeing their exorbitantly priced apartments in cities like San Francisco and Seattle. The biggest beneficiary of that WFH homebuying wave was undoubtedly Boise—where home prices skyrocketed 53%. You could even call it the poster child of the pandemic housing boom.

But that Boise honeymoon is over. While spiking mortgage rates have pushed the overall U.S. housing market into a slowdown, it has delivered a particularly hard blow to the Boise housing market. That has seen both Boise home sales plummet—down 28% on a year-over-year basis—and inventory levels surge—up 161% this year. It’s also chipping away at home values. According to Zillow, the median Boise home sales price fell 3.5% in June.  https://fortune.com/2022/07/18/bubbly-housing-markets-boise-phoenix-got-home-price-top-blown-off/amp/

This downturn is going to have enormous implications for home builders as well.

The European Central Bank on Thursday increased interest rates for the first time in 11 years in an attempt to cool rampant inflation in the euro zone.

The ECB, the central bank of the 19 nations that share the euro currency, surprised markets by pushing its benchmark rate up by 50 basis points, bringing its deposit rate to zero. Traders had expected a smaller hike of 25 basis points.

“The Governing Council judged that it is appropriate to take a larger first step on its policy rate normalisation path than signalled at its previous meeting,” the ECB said in a statement Thursday.

The Frankfurt institution had kept rates at historic lows, in negative territory since 2014, as it dealt with the region’s sovereign debt crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.

The euro rose to a session high on news of the more aggressive rate hike, to trade at $1.0257. The yield on the 10-year Italian bond also jumped on the news, extending gains after reacting to the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Draghi earlier on Thursday.",finance,1658413694
personalfinance,Should I use my Airbnb income to pay my mortgage?,"Hi guys,

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read &amp; respond to my question!

I just went live on Airbnb 5 days ago and things have moved really fast since! I am now booked out until November. I have one weekend stay coming up next week, which will immediately be followed by a 3 month stay.

My mortgage is $1900, I will be receiving $4500/mo and paying my girlfriend $500 for rent since she is taking me in.

I purchased my house in 2021, and my interest rate is only 2.8%. When I told my friend that my plan was to pay off my house, he advised that I set that money aside towards another investment instead of paying it off. The logic being that a 2.8% Interest Rate is the lowest interest on a loan I'll ever get in my life. 

If you agree with this logic, how would you recommend I invest my money? I am not a fan of stocks at all because I am too much of an emotional trader. Been there, done that, lost money. Don't feel comfortable doing it again. Lol.

personalfinance,Just found out my employer will no longer cover my college tuition as a benefit. What to do next?,"Age: 30

Location: HCOL area, NYC suburbs

Salary: $78k, full time IT sysadmin job in the public sector 

Checking accounts: $18k (had double that last year, but recently accrued significant surgery-related out of pocket expenses) 

IRA from old job: $28k

IRA from current job: $8k

Education: Associates in IT, about 39 credits away from a Bachelors in Business Management. 3.9 GPA

Credit score: over 800

Family/partnership status: single, no kids or pets, no close friends in the area

Back in 2020, I learned that through my union, I was eligible for tuition free college through an accredited brick and mortar state school with a 100% online bachelors degree program in Business Management. I’ve been taking classes while working full time ever since, but I just learned yesterday that this program will be ending, meaning that I will now need to pay for school. 

I currently have no debts and am extremely wary of taking out loans for any reason. Since student loans can never be discharged, I especially want to avoid taking them on by any means necessary. Unfortunately, due to my health history, I cannot enlist in the military. I was also unable to obtain a bachelors at the socially acceptable time of ages 18-22 due to my strict fundamentalist upbringing, as my parents made it clear they would kick me out and disown me for going to a “worldly” 4 year college. 

Ideally, I would continue doing an online-only program through an accredited brick and mortar college. The way I see it, I have a couple of options to finish school:

Option 1: 

- continue working my full time job and taking classes as I have already been doing
- Pros: still earning an income
- Cons: risk of burnout from continually working and going to school, and the lack of free time

Option 1a:

- cash out the $28k from the IRA for my old job, and continue working full time while using those funds to pay for school
- Pros: will likely be able to finish school debt free, and staying employed will allow me to still accrue money in my current IRA
- Cons: mostly depleted retirement funds

Option 1b:

- take out $20-25k of student loans, and continue working full time
- Pros: preserve my retirement
- Cons: will likely not qualify for federal loans due to income and full time job, necessitating costlier private loans with higher interest rates, thus eliminating most of the financial benefits of working or going to school 

Option 2: 

- quit full time job and go to school full time. Relocate to a LCOL state and spend 1.5-2 years taking the max amount of credits every semester to graduate ASAP
- Pros: can focus full time on school, lowering the risk of burnout, have the opportunity to move to another part of the country
- Cons: no income, out of the job market

Option 2a:

- Cash out the combined $36k from both IRAs, use that to pay for most of school/cost of living wherever I move 
- Pros: lowers the amount I need to take out in loans
- Cons: depleted retirement 

Option 2b:

- Take out student loans to pay for school/cost of living in new location
- Pros: protects my retirement, no job/income maximizes the amount I can receive in loans/grants/aid, living in a LCOL area could minimize the amount I need to borrow
- Cons: greater amount of loans to pay back 


All of this is assuming that I continue with the business management degree. I have been thinking of going back for computer science for the past couple of years, but that would be more expensive and take more time to graduate. I most likely would also need to be in school full time for CS due to the intensity of schoolwork. 

I’m really unsure as to how to proceed.

economy,"Interest Rates Should be Market-Determined, Not by the Fed","The  intra-bank lending rate set by the fed is the default ""price of money"".  In the US and the developed world in general, we believe in the free  market. We don't let the government control the price of tractors or  lumber. So why do we let the Fed control the interest rates instead of  the market?

Since **when did we, in the US and the developed world, develop such a hatred for the free market**,  that we're willing to let the government mandate price controls for  what is arguably the most basic commodity - money? All our monetary  problems will be fixed if the market simply sets the interest rates  instead of the Fed.

The entire principle of the free market is that **the government is not smart enough to dictate prices**.  The prices in a free market are signals, coalescing all the information  available from millions of entities in a way that a centralized  authority like the government cannot, thereby allocating resources more  efficiently than a top-down system. This is understood fact in today's  world. Everyone accepts it.

But **when it comes to the price of money, suddenly everyone forgets basic economics.**

High  inflation? No problem - the market will automatically raise interest  rates to compensate, since no idiot will lend money for less than the  inflation rate. Problem solved.

To be clear, **I am not advocating for deregulation**.  Someone always pipes in saying that the wild west monetary system leads  to crashes. I'm not saying that we should abolish our controls on  things like capital reserve requirements, FDIC insurance, auditing of  banks, the SEC, or anything else. Just that the intra-bank lending rate  needs to be determined by the market instead of the Fed. Regulations  will ensure that banks remain healthy.

**The Fed will still be the lender of last resort**.  It will lend money to distressed banks at the market rate + haircut  costs. This will ensure that banks first turn to each other to maintain  their reserve requirements, and only approach the Fed when necessary to  avoid the extra fees. Exactly how it works right now, in fact.

Danger of liquidity crisis = None

CryptoCurrency,"CFTC hits out at SEC for ""regulation by enforcement"", CFTC's commissioner alleges SEC is usurping its jurisdiction over utility tokens and requests the SEC to follow transparent rule making","It seems there is a  full blown war between regulatory agencies SEC and CFTC over who gets to regulate what crypto. The CFTC commissioner just published a strong reply to the SEC's lawsuit filed today against the Coinbase employees for insider trading, where the SEC alleges many tokens are securities.

In the CFTC response, they allege that the SEC is ""regulation by enforcement"" and alleging that many utility tokens are being classified as securities without the SEC having any jurisdiction over them.
 
Its true that the SEC's act of classifying tokens as securites could have implications for the whole crypto asset class. The SEC cant even win its lawsuit against LBRY or Ripple but is now alleging 7-8 other tokens as securities. Whats even more terrible is that the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase employee doesnt even include these token's issuers as defendants. So the developers of these tokens cant even make a case that they arent securites as alleged by the SEC


&gt; “[I]n the words of Federalist No. 49, ‘The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter . . . is derived.' Government is and should be the servant of the people, and it should be fully accountable to them for the actions which it supposedly takes on their behalf.” (H.R. Rep. No. 94-880 (Pt. 1), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2183, 2184).

&gt; The case SEC v. Wahi is a striking example of “regulation by enforcement.”  The SEC complaint alleges that dozens of digital assets, including those that could be described as utility tokens and/or certain tokens relating to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), are securities.

&gt; The SEC’s allegations could have broad implications beyond this single case, underscoring how critical and urgent it is that regulators work together.  Major questions are best addressed through a transparent process that engages the public to develop appropriate policy with expert input—through notice-and-comment rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.  Regulatory clarity comes from being out in the open, not in the dark.

&gt; Twelve years ago on this day, the Dodd-Frank Act became law.  Since that time, the CFTC has faithfully carried out its expanded anti-fraud mission and has aggressively pursued wrongdoing in every one of our markets and all over the world.  Given the overriding public interest and the open questions on the legal statuses of various digital assets, such as certain utility tokens and DAO-related tokens, the CFTC should use all means available to fulfill its statutory mandate to vigorously enforce the law and uphold the Commodity Exchange Act.  This responsibility has been entrusted to us by the Congress and the American people.  The CFTC must not break that trust, and we must remember whom we serve.

Bit of background, I am a sole income provider for a family of 5. I bring home roughly 3500/mo, paid weekly. We currently have about 14k total in CC debt(2 cards @ 18%), a car payment for another 5 years and a mortgage for 20 more years as the large debts with about 6k in savings. I invest relatively heavy in my 401k at 18% and don't want to adjust that unless I have to. The major expenses total to be about 1900/mo, 500 for the CC, 400 for the car &amp; 985 for the mortgage. Obviously other expenses are incurred like groceries and gas, etc. So all in all we end the month with maybe 1-200 ""extra."" Recently, our roof has decided to leak(minor for now and it's being addressed tomorrow) and given the age of the home it is definitely in our best interest to replace it all. We were quoted at 11k for the roof which was the lowest offer so far after shopping around a bit. The company offered financing but it was a ""reasonable"" 26% interest through a 3rd party....


What is my best course of action going forward as far as a loan since I assume that is my only real option? I have an ok credit score, 690ish, and I am a vet so that opens up options like Navy Fed and USAA. The main talking point between my spouse and I is, do I take out a loan for the 11k and add to my expenses or is it better to go for say, 30k, like a pseudo-consolidation loan/home improvement loan and clean up all my debts? I much prefer the 2nd option pending the payment/APR of course. Maybe I just need someone to confirm my thought processes or maybe I'm underestimating a glaring mistake in my logic. I am not one to stress about money but this is the first real challenge and I'll admit I am freaking out juuust slightly. I greatly appreciate any and all assistance in this.

A week later, they sent me a letter stating that since it was a business checking account, I did not ""qualify for coverage under Federal Regulation E"" and they went on to say that they would look into protection from MasterCard. They said they would contact me if they needed anything from me. Three months later, they sent me a letter stating that I  ""do not have any rights in accordance to MasterCard rules to pursue your dispute. Union Bank is unable to intercede on your behalf and as a result we are unable to offer further assistance or make any adjustments to your account.""

I called Union Bank and was told to E-mail claimsoperations@unionbank.com with an inquiry request. I was told it would take a few business days for a response. This was nine days ago with no response. I don't know what I can do now.

How is this right that I'm not protected in any way, especially if the card was stolen and used as a credit card? Do I have any other steps I can take, perhaps a different body? Any advice would be helpful. Thank you.",finance,1658439076

btc,U.S. and U.K. see role for central banks in oversight of stablecoins.,"U.S. Lawmakers Nearing Agreement on Stablecoin Regulation

The debate over stablecoin regulation largely hinges on whether to treat issuers like banks or money-market mutual funds. The bill being proffered by Waters and McHenry falls more on the side of treating them like banks, not only requiring compliance with federal supervision but also adherence to capital and liquidity rules.

Consequently, the bill would also authorize stringent requirements for the assets used to back a stablecoin. Supposedly, this will reduce the risks of destabilizing fire sales of those assets in a crisis. Other restrictions would include prohibiting non-financial companies from issuing such products and imposing a stricter separation between financial firms and tech companies.

In the U.K., 2009 Banking Act Amended to Incorporate Stablecoin Regulations

As per the bill, Her Majesty’s Treasury department will be in charge of drafting all regulations pertaining to the payment systems, issuers, and services providers of digital settlement assets (DSA).

As per the bill, the Bank of England will be in charge of establishing the rules that will regulate how DSA service providers function. Meanwhile, the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) will be permitted to weigh in on regulations and actions that seek to foster the proper function of these entities except under specific circumstances such as those that may threaten to destabilize the UK’s financial system.

He (Chancellor Zawahi) added: “In fostering these new innovations, the Bill will also enable the creation of Financial Markets Infrastructure Sandboxes – allowing firms to test the use of new technologies and practices in financial markets, increasing efficiency, transparency and resilience of new products”.",cryptocurrency,1658441006

datascience,Current DS student needs resume help to apply for internships,"Hi. My son is a DS student at UCSD. He just finished his first year and is getting ready to apply for internships. We have a few connections at Meta/FB and Google (through some relatives of my friends), so he plans to apply for internships there next summer (I’ve read how competitive it is for CS internships there and in not sure if it’s a different process for the DS students since I found out that they actually have different recruiters for DS). 

He’s currently taking summer classes and is applying for unpaid remote internships with the federal government, so he asked me to help him with his resume. He’s actually double majoring (in DS and Economics), so he hasn’t had time to do much outside of school. I’ve been encouraging him to get a job on campus this summer, but that’s been challenging because the campus is now so empty (most of the jobs posted now don’t start until September) and he doesn’t have a car to get to a job off campus. 

I don’t have a clue as to how I can help him since I don’t really understand what he’s learning. He has a GitHub with a couple of small class projects that he did last summer, but nothing since. He’s primarily taken the core requisites and math classes (calculus 1-3, linear algebra, and he will be completing a mathematical reasoning/proofs class next month). I know he’s done some data visualization with Tableau and Python, but aside from using Python and basic JS, I don’t know what other things to add to his resume. 

I’m a single mom with no knowledge about this industry beyond what little I’ve researched, and we don’t have the money to hire a professional to help us. I’d appreciate any advice, direction, links or assistance. Thank you all in advance. We both really appreciate it.",technology,1658442121

solar,Did I mess up my installation?,"Renovating an old house...decided to add a passive solar water heater.  My logic was, if I fed the output from that passive heater into my gas water heater, the gas water heater wouldn't have to work so hard, as the water would already be hot, so I would use less gas (it's bottled gas where I am, and it's a pain to go and get it, switch 45kg bottles etc), and I would also have the advantage of always having hot water without having to switch between the systems.

However, I don't seem to be saving as much gas as I thought I would.  Perhaps, since we use almost no hot water during the daytime (baths for 2 kids and showers for 2 adults at night, some dishwashing during the day and at night), the hot water from the solar heater is sitting in the gas water heater and cooling down, so I'm getting no advantage from it?

Should I add a bypass so I can use the passive solar and then switch over to the gas heater (and light the pilot light on that heater) when the hot water runs out?

personalfinance,California taxes and HSA,"So I just discovered that HSAs are not as beneficial in the state of California. They are still subject to income tax and capital gains taxes. I've even heard that most places do not create the necessary paperwork for you to easily fill out your tax forms since it's such a unique thing. 

This is my first year with an HSA and I have been investing the paycheck deductions as well my employer contributions. And reinvesting my dividends and interest. How difficult is it going to be to do my taxes next year? Should I stop investments and just use the funds like an FSA? Any strategies people in CA use that I should be aware of? Feeling overwhelmed

EDIT: there seems to be a lot of assuming in the responses. Most people are saying ""it's easy, it does it for you"" with no direct response saying the information I've found is wrong, and at least one person saying the info is correct. 

Here is the article: https://thefinancebuff.com/california-new-jersey-hsa-tax-return.html

And the specific quote:
""Because the HSA earnings are tax-free at the federal level, the HSA provider won’t send any 1099 for the earnings. Those earnings are still taxable by California. You have to go into the HSA account statements and tally up all the earnings during the year. This includes all interest and dividends paid inside the HSA.

The HSA earnings again must be included on the Schedule CA (540), column C Additions. If you use tax software, you have to figure out how to make the software do it. If you use a tax preparer, make sure you give the HSA earnings to your tax preparer and make sure the earnings are included on Schedule CA (540), column C Additions.""",finance,1658445234

On a longer term perspective, we know the Federal Reserve is not afraid to implement further rate hikes this year to combat inflation which will of course cause further USD strength.

Technical's seem to line up too as seen in the photo. Price has recently broken through 136.5, a historical point of resistance. I believe we are looking at a potential tap in to 136.5 - 137 zone for great potential long opportunities back up to recent highs at 139.",finance,1658445315

personalfinance,Refinancing a home mortgage.,"Hi there, sorry if this kind of topic isn't typical of the subreddit. I've been having a lot of anxiety lately being a new homeowner (almost).

I'm currently a student going to a private university with a pretty high tuition. I worked about five years to make sure I had enough to pay off my tuition in full while minimizing the cost of any federal student loans (I only saved for the cost of the tuition, not counting books, housing etc). Everything is going according to plan until this year, my university increased the tuition some. This is on top of the already increasing gas prices and inflation in general. I'm starting to feel very, very anxious about my finances.

Now, I wasn't planning on taking this home from my parents until I finished. For some reason or another, they're moving forward with putting me on the title. Of course, I think they wanted to sell the home originally, so they decided to refinance the remaining mortgage and, at the same time, open a loan with the mortgage company. So the amount of the mortgage is going up again with the loan. Another 30 years. The other thing is, the loan they made. They couldn't get the loan without me. I make more than they do. So I'm a co-borrower. 

Was this an alright decision? Have I screwed myself here. Essentially I'm walking out of this with nothing in my pocket. Just a home I need to continue to pay for and for a price higher than I was originally expecting.

If I am unable to pay for the loan and have to default and they take my home, how will it affect my chances to get another home? So many questions. I want to emphasize: I have no experience in finance or anything like that. This is all very new to me. So this could actually be the best decision ever made and I wouldn't know about it. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm hoping it's not the end of the world for me.

More details about the home: It was made during wartime. It's an old house, perhaps around the 50s. It was upgraded from a two bedroom home to a two story with four bedrooms. It's quite a nice place but I have some repairs I'd like to make when I'm done with school and can focus on the house. This house is in dire need of some repairs. Retrofitting. Things like that. Some outlets don't even have a three prong outlet. The loan itself is about 400 grand with 6.6% interest. The value of the property itself got an estimate of about 670 grand.",finance,1658445753

I call the alternate number and they said (more paraphrasing) ""We are overwhelmed, we are dealing with this email only due to being short staffed""

I usually pay attention to these things when I sign up, I usually don't accept the ""premium"" membership.  I don't have any proof that I did not accept that membership.

Don't recall signing up for a premium membership, charged anyway.  Got screenshots of my account showing I am still at a standard membership.

* What will happen if I don't pay this balance in my credit card, will I lose grace period?
* How strong is my case?

personalfinance,Empoyer refusing to pay out PTO after giving 2 weeks. (Minnesota),"I typically work Monday to Sunday and get Monday off and the rare weekend off depending on the schedule. I worked this weekend and had Monday off but on Tuesday (the 19th) I handed in my notice. My boss was out of town until Tuesday anyways.  

My notice stated my last day would be August 31st but I was willing to work September 1st if they needed me (short staffed in my department).

Also of note today was my 4 year anniversary with the company and I got a new round of PTO (I get a week and a half every 6 months)

They employee handbook states:
""In the event of resignation and a two-week notice has been given, any earned, unused PTO will be paid at 50% of the accrued balances. Employees who are terminated forfeit any earned, unused PTO pay.""

Today the COO of the company informed me she wouldn't be paying out my PTO as I didn't give a 2 weeks notice, which while I technically didn't give a 14 day notice the handbook only specifies 2 weeks and I wouldn't be working those days normally, and I did volunteer to work what would be day 13.

Browsing another Reddit thread I found this and read up on the stature::
In Minnesota, employers must pay earned vacation time under the terms of any agreement with employees, such as a collective bargaining agreement or an employee handbook. The law defines “wage supplements” as including vacation pay (MN Stat. Sec. 181.74, subd. 2). When an employee leaves a job, the question of payment for vacation time will depend on what the employer has established as eligibility requirements for vacation. If the employee has satisfied the eligibility requirements and has accrued vacation, but has not used it, the employee must be paid for the time upon termination.

So, I am tired of death of this company and am not really surprised they are trying to get one last thing over on me but is there anything I can do? I could use an outside perspective here.",finance,1658446161

I strongly recommend reading through what I wrote and also some of the comments in the Investing Sub post. I basically made a case for buying Citi since it seemed ridiculously underpriced. I backed my predictions with DCF analysis and such.

Anyways, I'm posting this because it seems that many of my predictions have since come to fruition. For some reason, many believed that Citi's Q2 financials would be underwhelming due to inflation and such. Therefore, in the weeks before Citi released their Q2 financials, Citi's stock price fell to prices as low as $43/share. However, as I pointed out in my original post, rising interest rates are **good** for banks like Citi. Then on July 15th, 2022, Citi released their Q2 financials and the stock price has since soared from $43/share to prices currently around $52/share. Citi's Q2 performance wildly exceeded expectations, largely due to rising interest rates being profitable for them.

I apologize if this comes off as conceited. I don't mean to brag.

However, even with this sudden spike in price, it still seems a bit undervalued. In my original post, using DCF Analysis, I arrived at an ""intrinsic value""/intrinsic share price of $254.68/share. Not only that, but even in my ""worst-case scenario"" future free cash flow projections, I still arrived at an ""intrinsic value"" of $56.55/share. Both of these values are higher than the current share price.

However, as many comments in the original thread pointed out, it's probably not a good idea to use DCF analysis to value banks. Many suggested using the dividend discount model (DDM) instead. Using the DDM model, I came up with an intrinsic value of $70.16/share, which is far closer to the actual price. But that still means that the stock is still moderately undervalued.

Many in that thread also suggested other methods to calculate an intrinsic value such as P/E and P/B. Seeking Alpha multiplied consensus analyst estimates for FY22 by the average valuation multiples for P/E, P/B, and P/TBV of Citi and its peers, and calculated a price target of $81.13/share. For some reason, Seeking Alpha links are not allowed on this sub, but this can be found in the Seeking Alpha article titled ""Citigroup Q2 Earnings: Outperforming Peers And Expectations""

They also seem to agree that the stock is still undervalued.

However, there are some reasons why Citi might not be a good buy. This year, Citi decided to freeze its dividend hikes to build its capital buffers. This stagnating dividend may deter investors from this stock despite their financials improving. However, its dividend yield is still at 3.92%, making it one of the highest in the industry. But this dividend freeze is due to a relatively poor Stress Test results, with Citi displaying lackluster capital buffers. This is a reason to think more carefully before deciding whether to go all in on Citi. But that seems like a minor issue in the grand scheme of things.

Warren Buffett recently invested an **enormous** amount of money into Citi. His ""stamp of approval"" bodes well for the future of this stock.

Overall, Citi is still a good buy. It would be very surprising if its price does not increase to $80+ in the near future. What do you guys think? Is Citi a good buy?",finance,1658448951

investing,The Economic Consequences of Jerome Powell,"(National Review) -- Due to his data-driven monetary-policy approach, the Fed chairman's 'soft landing' is looking less likely.

Jerome Powell  risks going down in history as the Federal Reserve’s worst chairman  since Arthur Burns, who brought us runaway inflation in the 1970s.

He risks doing so by first having kept monetary policy too loose for  too long as he waited for clear signs of inflation to actually show up  in the data. He thereby lost control over inflation and added to an  asset-price bubble. He now risks allowing the same data-driven approach  to cause him to slam on the monetary-policy brakes too hard to regain  control over inflation even at the likely cost of a deep recession.

Last year, the Fed clung to the belief that the inflation we were  experiencing was a transitory phenomenon. It did so despite early  indications that the combination of the largest peacetime budget  stimulus on record and an ultra-loose monetary policy would soon lead to  economic overheating. Instead, the Fed insisted that, before it  considered normalizing its monetary-policy stance, it would await data  showing that inflation expectations were becoming unanchored.

These views led the Fed to keep interest rates at their zero lower  bound and continue buying $120 billion a month in Treasury bonds as well  as mortgage-backed securities through most of last year. The net result  was that inflation surged to a multi-decade high while bubbles formed  in the equity, housing, and credit markets. Equity valuation reached  highs experienced only once before in the last hundred years while  housing prices increased to levels above those in 2006 even in  inflation-adjusted terms.

Fast-forward to today, we find that the Fed is making the same  mistake that it made last year but in reverse. Now with each higher  inflation print, the Fed is accelerating the pace of its monetary-policy  tightening. It is doing so without waiting to see the results of its  earlier monetary-policy actions.

This approach is inducing the Fed to now raise interest rates in  75-basis-point steps rather than by the more normal 25 basis points,  even though there are clear signs that the economy is on the cusp of a  recession and that inflationary pressures are abating, as indicated by  the sharp drop in international commodity prices. It is also inducing  the Fed to remain committed to withdrawing $95 billion a month in market  liquidity through quantitative tightening, even though equity and bond  markets are wavering.

Among the indications that the economy is already slowing are the  Atlanta Fed’s estimates that this past quarter the economy might have  contracted for a second quarter in a row. Other indications of slowing  are the decline in consumer sentiment to its [lowest level on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-10/us-consumer-sentiment-slumps-to-record-low-on-inflation-woes?sref=KgEBWdKh)  because of high inflation, the crumbling in housing demand as a result  of higher mortgage rates, and the loss of export competitiveness on  account of a strong dollar.

As if a weakening economy were not reason enough for the Fed to  exercise caution in slamming on the monetary-policy brakes,  international commodity prices are declining sharply across the board.  They are doing so in anticipation of a weakening global economy. Over  the past two months, international oil, copper, lumber, and wheat prices  have all declined by over 20 percent. This very likely means that U.S.  consumer-price inflation has already peaked.

If aggressively raising interest rates at a time when the economy is  on the cusp of a recession makes little sense, withdrawing large amounts  of liquidity at a time when the equity- and credit-market bubbles are  bursting makes even less sense. Since the start of the year, not only  have the NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 lost around 30 percent and 20 percent in  value, respectively, but the bond market, too, has lost around 20  percent while the cryptocurrency markets have lost some 70 percent.

The steep decline in financial-market prices is bound to have a  meaningfully negative impact on the economic outlook. It will do so by  having wiped out over the past six months an estimated combined $15  trillion in household financial wealth. Feeling poorer, households must  be expected to cut back their spending in an effort to rebuild their  depleted savings.

All of this makes it all too likely that history will not treat  Jerome Powell kindly. First, he brought us multi-decade-high inflation.  Now he seems to be going out of his way to ensure that the economy has a  hard landing.

cybersecurity,My Day-to-Day Cyber Security duties at an NYC MSP. Looking to transition into a Full SOC Role and Need your Advice.,"**About Me:**

I’ve been in the MSP space for 11 Years now. Primarily in New York City. (Very fast-paced) Started in 2011 at level 1 and worked my way up. I’ve worked in the following roles

* · Helpdesk
* · Field Tech
* · Project Engineer
* · Systems Engineer (90% Windows 10% AWS)
* · Tech Alignment Manager

I was a part of building our Cyber Security department in our MSP and I am currently leading the CS team. Although I am leading it, I am still in between other NON-CS Projects and escalations. I would like to get away from this and focus Primarily on Cyber Security. I have been reviewing CS engineer and SOC Analyst Positions and feel it’s what my heart desires.

**Current Cert:**

* · MS 365 cert (forgot the number)
* · N10-007

&amp;#x200B;

**My Problem**: I need your help to determine with my skillset below, what CS job Role would be the best fit for me. I am looking to get out of the MSP game and into a Full Cyber Security Role. I am currently doing Cyber Security, Some Networking, server, and Cloud Projects. I also handle Networking, server, and Cloud escalations.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

* · They are reminded during the exit interview and are given a copy of the signed agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a 3-rule principle I like to use for myself and my team.

I have three major rules I always follow and encourage others to do the same. This is absolutely off topic but as a long-time lurker, everyone is all caught up in Certs, experience, and acing an interview. No one ever talks about personal Principles or self-taught rules. Here are mine!

You can skip my rules but here are some tips.

**#1 Rule:**

Multi-factor Authentication:

* · We use Duo Mobile Security.
* · ALL ACCOUNTS MUST USE MFA.
* · Any accounts that don’t have MFA are immediately disabled. Admin, Users, and any other account with any kind of permissions or even limited restrictions.
* · This is included for any Vendor site, MSP Portal, and Servers. We use Duo Security for workstations and Servers. We also replace the MS version for AD/o365 with Duo Security.
* · Any accounts that were flagged due to MFA being disabled get an e-mail sent to their manager/supervisor/office manager stating that MFA was disabled, and the user needs to contact me. (We do NOT do this to get anyone in trouble however we are not here to babysit so we have management handle that.)

**#2 Rule:**

Work-Life Balance:

* · My team is not robots, we are human beings.
* · We have emotions and a limit.
* · Be honest with management, be firm, and be heard. Not a turd.
* · If you don’t say anything then it’s assumed that there are no issues
* · If you feel a manager or supervisor is not handling the situation
* · Talk to your teammates
* · Bring it up in a team meeting.
* · If you are uncomfortable about the situation talk to a friend, or family member and most of all ask us on Reddit!
* · We do not spy on or monitor our employees and engineers. Because Trust and Respect go a long way. If you cannot trust your team, then the issue is you. Go and resolve your issues and then come back to work.
* · Having a bad day? Don’t suck it up, let everyone know you’re not feeling well today. Tell them you’re working light today. No one needs your bad energy. Don’t kill my vibe.
* · Short staffed? Get a Jr Engineer to fill in. It’s ok for them to have downtime.
   * Let them work between departments – Field, Projects, and Helpdesk.
* · To help with downtime, Encourage Certs and Online training.
* · Buy yourself time and Manpower to prevent a situation where you’re unable to keep the ship afloat.

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 Rule:**

Obtain and Retain Vendor Service contracts for Vendor Support and Warranty.

* · Again, my team is not robots. We are human beings
* · Biggest flaw in cyber security is Human Error
* · Vendor support is always a plus.
* · What do you do when you have an emergency and the engineer who is excellent at SonicWall Firewalls is on a 2-week vacation in Costa Rica?
* · Do you call him?
* · NO! you get the next engineer that feels comfortable enough to jump in and work with Vendor Support.
* · Don’t have anyone? There are many talented engineers for Hire eager to learn.
* · Check Reddit forums such as SysAdmin, Cybersecurity, and CompTIA
* · Get training for a specific software or Tool your company uses
* · Don’t play games with Clients Data because you had an Engineer Guestimate.

Looking to get out of the MSP game and into a Full Cyber Security Role.",technology,1658456961
personalfinance,Stay Federal or Go Private,"Thought this was a jobs question but it's more of a personal finance question.

I am currently a full-time VA employee with a job in medical supply but I am going to school to switch to a career in IT. I am having trouble figuring out my next move. Here are the details: 

- Currently a GS 6 Step 8 (RUS pay scale so roughly $50,000/yr) with 3 1/2 years in the VA.
- 3 years prior military service which I've already bought back.
- Currently on a Leave of Absence (LWOP) doing a paid internship related to my degree at a private company making about the same per hour as I'm making at the VA.
- Potential transition to full-time employment with private company immediately after internship before I finish my degree which I have 1 year left of. 

My dilemma comes when I think about what I'd potentially be losing/gaining from transitioning to a job in the private sector. 

Taking a full-time position with the private company doing work in IT would give me the much needed experience to officially change careers from the medical field. It would be a great opportunity for growth. However, I'd essentially be starting from the bottom in terms of pay, but not less than what I am making at the VA now. And I'd be giving up some benefits the VA affords (more sick/annual leave, more holidays off, etc.) 

Also, working at the VA I currently only have a 3 minute commute to work and pay around $980 in rent (excluding electric/internet, etc.). If I were to take a full-time role with the private company I'd have to give up my apartment to move closer to the job in the city. The apartments in that city are going for minimum $1,300 for a 1-bdrm and my commute would be around 40 minutes each way on average. 

I've calculated if I were to continue to stay with the VA and work my 30 years, I'd be 52 by the time I reached 30 years tenure. However, IIRC I know retirement would not be possible until 57. Also, I really don't like working in the medical field and only do this job because it was what I was trained for in the military. 

So my questions are: 

Should I stay with the VA and just wait until I finish my degree, then start applying to IT positions within the federal government after I graduate? 

Or should I take a leap of faith with the private company to gain much needed experience and make the career transition to the IT field and then come back to the government after I have a few years of experience under my belt?

Forex,Is technical analysis easier than fundamental analysis?,"I've only ever traded short-term, so technical analysis has been my primary analysis for trading. Where I am in life now, I have less time to trade so quickly, but fundamental analysis, which is what you'd use for long-term trading, seems SOOOO complicated. Or maybe I am overcomplicating it. I don't know anything about politics, inter-continental trades, interest rates, or any of that. I've always avoided trading during the news for my short-time trading. For long-term trading, news seems to be essential.

Do I really need a degree in political sciences to trade long term? I am so lost lol",finance,1658458624
personalfinance,only able to contribute $50 a month to my son's 529,"**edit 3**: sorry for so many edits. i saw that there were a lot of additional questions and comments, so i think making another edit to address those would be quicker than replying to every comment. and by the way, you guys are awesome; i didn't expect to wake up this morning with so many more comments! if i had known, i would have used reddit sooner. this is a great community.

so to provide clarity regarding our retirement plans - yes, my husband and i each have a roth IRA, and we also share a community property brokerage investment account, both through schwab. we went with schwab because my husband already has a checking account with them.

again, much like the 529, there's not much in there right now, but we are trying to make consistent deposits even if small... for the community property brokerage investment account, we do the ""set it and forget it"" thing where schwab robo-manages the trades for us based on our risk tolerance profile.

for our roth IRAs, we take a more active approach in manually trading with the cash we have in there. not sure if it's the best strategy since i'm definitely a layperson when it comes to finance stuff, but we decided to diversify with stocks/ETFs of various individual corporations/businesses that we like, rather than going with index funds, because going this route *seems* to allow the biggest bang for our buck with potential after-tax capital gains. again, i could be completely wrong about this approach, and if i am, i'm sure i'll find out the hard way - either through here at reddit or in real life if we lose all our money. lol.

as for how it is possible that we have friends that could afford the $300 to $500 monthly contributions to their 529s, while we ourselves can't - well, all i can say to that is that our friends are down-to-earth and genuine people, and they don't look down on us just because we are nowhere near financially on the same level as they are. they also have super high paying jobs (i.e., doctors, engineers, tech, etc.), while we don't. and no, we don't have the smallest house on the block, because well...we don't have a house. lol.

again, to reiterate - we don't have anymore credit card debt (we practically starved ourselves for a while to make sure that the debt would get obliterated, stat. not to mention i married into it, so i made doubly sure that it was a team effort of starvation lol). we just have the car loan (of which we have about two years worth of payments remaining) and the federal student loan (of which interest will kick in again i think in august? but i believe even when interest accrues again, we have about two to three years left on that as well).

i didn't think that these details were relevant when i made this post, but i'm now quickly realizing that they are because it seems like one decision here would affect the direction of another decision there.

\---

**edit 2**: someone mentioned actually investing the contributions, which i believe i did. i chose to place the money in a 2039 enrollment target fund where it's aggressive in the beginning then gets more conservative as he gets closer to college-freshman age... was this the way to go or should i have done something differently? it seems i have a lot to learn... oh boy.

\---

**edit 1**:  wow, thank you so much for your feedback and encouragement everyone. i just read all of it and really appreciate the perspectives.

yes, i'm willing to be educated if i'm wrong on the numbers, but i was presuming 17 years down the road with educational inflation being on pace with how it is now, and also assuming room and board would be a factor in the tuition costs. we live in california.

i'm not really a big ""finance head,"" so if the numbers are actually better then, yes, please show me. 🙏🏼 i hope i'm wrong.

\---

**original post**: for context, my husband and i don't make much money, and our focus right now is to pay down some of our remaining outstanding debt such as my car and his federal student loans. credit card debt has been paid off.

however, i did want to invest into my son's educational future, so i opened a 529 for him. i was in for a rude awakening though: i later did the math, and in order for his college to be paid for in any meaningful way (in-state), i would need about $400,000 ultimately scurried away. that's at least $1,000 savings a month present day.

i asked my other friends how much they were saving for their kids' 529, out of curiosity, and almost all of them responded by saying they were putting away at least $300 to $500 a month.

meanwhile, my husband and i over here are only able to put away a pathetic $50 a month. was opening up the 529 even worth the effort? i can't help but feel like i'm setting my son up for failure because of our financial struggles, and he's only 18 months old... lol.",finance,1658459214

defi,What benefits do DeFi have?,"https://preview.redd.it/d1mh8jx932d91.jpg?width=931&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcd4b2123424db5164862f6543d9f2a7fdfc06d

Blockchain finances are born from the promise of creating an alternative to the traditional financial market, where money is guarded by institutions and arbitrations ruled by courts. The figure of the intermediary is a fundamental piece in the functioning of traditional finances, and users need to place their trust in them when using the services. But doing so puts you at risk for censorship, theft, and excessive interest rates.  
 

According to Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin whitepaper, the goal of the DeFi ecosystem, starting with ideas like Bitcoin, is to do away with the middleman and provide consumers more security and efficiency. Each individual has control over their funds, as well as being responsible for securing and managing them at their convenience. restricts the authority of institutions. In this way, greater economic independence and a less manipulable market are promised.  
 

The DeFi ecosystem touts itself as a market that is simple to enter. The concept of ""open finance"" proposes to reduce the necessary requirements to opt for one of these services in the traditional market. For example, to access a loan in DeFi it is not necessary to have a bank account or own large amounts of money (or properties in your name). Likewise, many of these services propose to protect the privacy of their users, so it is not necessary to enter personal data to be able to use these platforms. People of every economic status, country, religious conviction, or political affiliation may now access financial goods because to this.  
 

Because a third party is no longer needed in charge, DeFi applications also turn out to be global financial services and much less expensive than traditional ones. Users can borrow, trade cryptocurrencies, or bet on an oracle under a fee schedule that is made up of market supply and demand. Likewise, blockchain networks make digital cross-border payments possible in a matter of hours or even minutes. A feature that banks cannot offer, whose transfer services to other countries usually take days to become effective.",cryptocurrency,1658468028

Forex,Will EUR/USD retest parity ahead of the FOMC Meeting?,"EUR/USD’s rebound from parity over the past week seems to have stemmed from the US Dollar’s weakness in the broader FX market, as opposed to demand for the Euro. 

While the Euro did initially rally on Thursday’s stronger-than-expected 50bps ECB rate hike, it quickly gave back those gains during the press conference as President Lagarde provided details on the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI). 

The introduction of the TPI makes sense given the seemingly greater threat of recession for the EU, but it does put a dampener on what was otherwise a relatively hawkish tone from the ECB, and resulted in EUR/USD paring gains. 

The pair has been unable to overcome selling pressure just below 1.0280 this week. Focus will now be on Fed meeting, and speculation on whether they have reached peak hawkishness, or will hike rates by 100bps, could play a key role in EUR/USD’s ability to break this resistance, or turns lower.

It was stated that the US and the EU were trying to turn the Republic of Moldova into a second Ukraine, pumping it with Western weapons. It was also suggested that it was precisely the patronage of the West over the authorities in Chisinau that prevents Moldova from dealing with a long-standing problem - the uncontrolled Transnistrian region, - where Russian troops have been stationed for 30 years. At the same time, no one in the Federation Council remembered that in 1999, Russia pledged to withdraw all the weapons and the entire personnel of its military contingent from the territory of Transnistria until 2003, in accordance with the decision of the Istanbul Summit of the OSCE.

The same day, the Russian Foreign Ministry complained that the Moldovan authorities once again detained Russian officers at the airport in Chisinau, who were heading to the unrecognized “Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic” (“PMR”) to replenish the peacekeeping contingent. At the same time, the main headquarters of the Russian Ground Forces stated that Moldova was blocking the supply of Russian military equipment to Transnistria by all means, hoping for the inevitable combat wear of the Russian contingent.

On July 20, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the “PRT” announced that the armed conflict between the “PRT”, strongly supported by Russia, and the Republic of Moldova could be resumed (for the first time since 1992). The so-called president of the quasi-state entity in separatist Transnistria, Vadim Krasnoselsky, has showed teeth and warned that NATO member states could be involved in an escalating conflict in the region, bringing them into direct military confrontation with Russia. Naturally, the “authorities” in Tiraspol, first of all, had in mind the involvement of Romania in the conflict, since Romanians and Moldovans belong to the same ethnic group and speak the same (Romanian) language. Also, Tiraspol unreasonably and without evidence accused Chisinau that Moldova creates barriers for the import of food, fuel, medicines, fertilizers and industrial equipment to the “PMR”.

Shortly before this, ex-president Dmitry Medvedev has expressed his great dissatisfaction with

Moldova (now holding the post of deputy head of the Security Council of the Russian Federation). He specifically wrote that “in case of a serious mess, Russia will be ready to protect 220 thousand citizens of Russia living in Transnistria.” He also expressed a number of threats to Moldova due to the fact that in Chisinau considered the opportunity to join the sanctions against the Russian Federation, conducted by the anti - Putin coalition of the Western countries and their allies. The first thing D. Medvedev promised to do was to completely block Moldova supply of Russian natural gas and other resources.

In addition, the Russian Federation's establishment really does not like other things in Chisinau: the President of Moldova Maia Sandu and her “Party of Action and Solidarity” (PAS), which control the legislative and executive power, adhere to democratic and liberal values and want to enter the EU, not the EAEU (led by the Russian Federation); M. Sandu has announced the need to modernize the army, explaining this by a real threat from Putin's Russia; in Chisinau, the pro-Russian ex-president Igor Dodon and his minions are now being judged for corruption; Moldova blocks the rotation of Russian troops in the “PMR,” and constantly insists on withdrawing the Russian contingent from the left bank of the Dniester.

At least, Ukraine, the European Union and the United States should be prepared for such a development of events when totalitarian Russia attacks another sovereign democratic state.",finance,1658493602

**Dozens of cities and towns are paying tech workers to abandon Silicon Valley**  
A growing number of cities and towns all over the U.S. are handing out cash grants and other perks aimed at drawing skilled employees of faraway companies to live there and work remotely. In October there were at least 24 such programs in the U.S., today there are 71, according to the Indianapolis-based company MakeMyMove, which is contracted by cities and towns to set up such programs. Companies whose employees have participated in one remote worker incentive program in Tulsa, Okla., include Adobe, Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Meta, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Lyft, Netflix, Oracle and Siemens. Local governments are offering up to $12,000 in cash, along with subsidized gym memberships, free babysitting and office space.

**Canadian airlines suffer delays and cancellations due to Zayo outage**  
In another Canadian internet outage story, air travel across Western Canada was impacted Thursday by an internet outage affecting the country’s air navigation service provider Nav Canada. This was due to a disruption in the network of Zayo, a telecommunications provider based in Colorado, that Nav Canada uses in parts of the country’s western region. This was not a cyberattack, but was instead caused by a train derailment that disrupted two key fiber lines managed by one of Zayo’s fiber providers in Canada.

**Heatwave forced Google and Oracle to shut down in London**  
As record temperatures hit much of the UK on Tuesday, tech giants Google and Oracle suffered outages as cooling systems failed at London data centers. Oracle reported overheating problems just before 4:00 BST. The company pointed out how the unseasonably high temperatures in the London forced the data center units to operate “above their design limits,” the company wrote on a status page first spotted by The Register. Overheating also hit a Google Cloud data center in London at 6:00 p.m. Only a “small set of customers” were affected.

**Vendors not patching for speculative execution**  
The firmware security company Binarly issued a report finding that many enterprise vendors are not patching with mitigations for a variety of speculative execution attacks. We recently reported on one such attack called Retbleed, which found a way to get around existing Return Tramoline, or repoline mitigations. But Binarly found that 339 firmwares from HP, Dell, and Lenovo didn’t even use the repoline mitigations in the first place, calling it a “failure in the firmware supply chain.” The report also said that in cases where firmware was updated to add mitigation, it found implementation mistakes that spawned subsequent security issues.

**Now we have to worry about SATA cables**  
There are few pleasures in life as pure and absolute as the air-gap defeating techniques from the mad scientists/security researchers at Ben-Gurion University. The researchers documented how SATA cables in a PC can be used as an antenna to exfiltrate data. As usual for these types of exploits, the technique requires an already infected machine, making it somewhat academic. The researchers used the cables to deliver data over radio channels around 5.9995 GHz during read and write operations at ranges up to 3.9 feet. Speeds weren’t great, peaking at 1 bit per second. The paper also proposes a countermeasure, adding noise during read/write operations.

**Car GPS tracker exposes location data**  
Security researchers at BitSight found six vulnerabilities in a GPS tracker from the company Micodus. This tracker includes a hardcoded password that can be used to remotely control it, access real-time location data, past routes, and even cut off fuel. The tracker also ships with a default user password of “123456,” with researchers finding 95% of sampled devices didn’t change it. The company claims to have over 1.5 million hardwired GPS trackers in use across vehicle fleets, national governments, militaries, and law enforcement. BitSight characterized these vulnerabilities as “not difficult to exploit” and suggest that other trackers from the company may have similar vulnerabilities. Impacted trackers largely reside in Ukraine, Russia, Uzbekistan, and Brazil, as well as across western and central Europe.

**Russian malware groups spoof pro-Ukraine apps**  
Researchers at Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered that the pro-Kremlin threat group Turla created an app called Cyber Azoz, which references Ukraine’s far-right military unit. Last year the same group compromised EU and American organizations with malware. The app claims it launches a denial-of-service attack against Russian websites. Instead the app installs a trojan on a device. The app must be sideloaded and not available on the Play Store. Google researchers believe only a small number of people installed this spoofed app.

**Microsoft cuts security jobs amidst weakening economy**  
Microsoft announced it plans to eliminate open jobs, affecting its Azure cloud business and security software unit, as the economy continues to weaken. The company said it’s honoring job offers that have already been made for open roles. The move follows similar hiring slowdowns announced by Google and Apple. Next Tuesday, Microsoft will announce the Azure unit’s percentage growth rate, a closely watched indicator in Microsoft’s quarterly earnings.

**TikTok is fastest growing news source for UK**  
The social video platform is the fastest growing news source for UK adults, according to a survey conducted by the UK Government’s Office of Communications. Nearly half of people using it for current affairs turn to fellow TikTokers rather than conventional news organizations for their updates. TikTok is used by 7% of adults for news, according to the UK’s communications watchdog, up from 1% in 2020. The growth is primarily driven by young users, with half of its news followers aged 16 to 24. A quarter of US adults say they always use TikTok to get the news, with nearly half of US millennial and Gen Z adults – under-41s and under-25s respectively – indicating the same, according to the analysis firm Forrester Research.

stocks,"How realistic are rate cuts next year, and is it really bullish?","The market is currently predicting that the Fed will cut interest rates next year. There can be multiple reasons for this:

1. Inflation has peaked and growth is slowing, so the Fed will cut to support the economy.
2. Bond market is predicting a recession and going to safety (bonds)
3. The bond market is getting ahead of itself and will have to reverse if the Fed signals they are not stopping/slowing rate hikes next year.

From my perspective, there are too many crosscurrents to make a reasonable determination of why bond yields are down, and why expectations are for rate cuts next year.

Concurrently, as the market prices in rate cuts for next year, forward inflation expectations are slowly rising. This could lead to the start-stop issue during the inflation of the 1970's, where Central Banks would raise rates to quash inflation, and as inflation came down a little, they would pause or cut rates, driving inflation right back up again, making it a structural issue until Volcker came along.

I'm hoping the Fed won't make the same mistake here until the data really shows inflation is meaningfully coming down.

I'm curious to see what everyone else thinks about the market pricing in rate cuts for next year means, and if it's bullish or bearish for stocks.",finance,1658502817
personalfinance,Heloc for auto loan and debt consolidation (US),"Hi,

I currently have a truck loan for 12k+ at 12.5% interest. I a heloc a good way to pay that off and get a lower interest rate. I also have about 4k in credit card debt at 20% interest id like also roll into it.

personalfinance,Home equity loan or HELOC for land purchase?,"Hey guys, my wife and I have agreed to purchase a piece of land for a future ""forever home"" from her parents, it's in a neighborhood they just never built on the lot. The current assessed value of the land is 100k, similar lots in the neighborhood are currently listed for 125-150k, and they've agreed to sell it to us for 60k. So we'd be buying into quite a bit of equity already.

The plan is to buy the lot and sit on it for a few years until we are ready to build, and so the question is what type of loan to use since a construction loan won't work with our timetable. Obviously land loans are the least favorable due to the high interest rates so a home equity loan or HELOC seem like the obvious answer. I currently owe ~121k on my home and current market value is around 260k. Can someone help me out with what the real difference between a home equity loan versus a HELOC for this type of purchase, besides the HELOC having an adjustable rate? 

I guess most of my ""issue"" is that I've been looking around some online and it seems the amount of lenders offering home equity loans is surprisingly low, while everyone and their mom offers HELOCs. So it would definitely seem like HELOCs are a more popular options(at least for the banks). But I don't really know how that translates through for the actual consumer. Are HELOCs really that much better for the consumer, or is it that banks just make more money off them so they don't offer regular equity loans?",finance,1658506868

personalfinance,Move my pension of keep it?,"Background:   I had a traditional pension (defined benefit) program from my employer.  On January 3 of 2022 this benefit design ceased and all current participants were converted to a cash balance design.  I was granted a starting balance equal to the PV of the expected annuity value at the time of conversion (~180k).  Each year following 12/31 I receive an interest credit equal to the greater of 3.5% or the 30 year US treasury yield.  I resigned after the conversion date and have moved to a different company.   

Discussion:  I initially planned to roll over this cash balance into an established IRA and sink it into a low cost index fund.  I am 20 years away from retirement.   Given the low returns of the market thus far this year and the expected increase in interest rates potentially increasing my interest payment…I am torn between rolling over and attempting to “buy low” in the market vs waiting to see if the treasury yield returns to something closer to where it was in the early 80’s (peak appears to be 15.21% in 1981).  

I’ve waffled on this for the last 4 months.   Am I considering my options correctly?

edit:   I note it wasn’t clear that I’m considering my options for the next 6-12 months only.  I recognize that over a 20 year window index performance would almost certainly outperform.   I’m just wondering if I should roll-over now or wait a bit longer knowing I have a guaranteed return coming.",finance,1658509788
bonds,The Federal Reserve Issued Proposed Rules to Implement the LIBOR Act,"On Tuesday, July 19, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board solicited public comment on regulations to replace LIBOR in contracts that will not mature before LIBOR ceases to be published (June 30, 2023). The proposed regulation limits the applicability of the regulation to contracts that do not have fallback provisions or have inadequate fallback provisions and will not apply to contracts in which the parties have agreed that their contract will not be subject to the LIBOR Act.

The proposed regulations would replace LIBOR with SOFR compounded in arrears for derivatives, and would replace existing one-, three-, six- and 12-month LIBOR with Term SOFR rate with a comparable tenor for most contracts and securities. However, for consumer contracts, the spread adjustment would be implemented over a one-year period.

CryptoCurrency,"Arrest of Coinbase employee is one of the best thing to happen in Crypto in 2022 - that will set a new course for ethics and transparency in Crypto, a key tenant for its mass adoption.","All (or well, most) of us are not surprised by the incident of insider trading within Coinbase - many Twitter/ Reddit posts have been made on this topic in the past. I can bet it's still happening within Coinbase as well as all other exchanges and it's really really shady because it hurts average retail investors. The moroninc VCs do ""insider trading"" all the time. This has been the single largest frustration in crypto over the past decade and has deterred many many people from their interest and participation in the space.

However, the event over the past few months/days including the investigation and arrest of the Coinbase employee is an incredible milestone in the journey of Crypto industry. I can't believe I am saying this but I am pleased to see Coinbase doing this investigation and of course Feds for acting quickly. I do hope this is one of many in the spirit of cracking down on ""shady"" practices within Crypto and bring a better order in the system and trust among common people. Action on some of the VCs who have destroyed retail investors in their pump-and-dump/ ICO scams would be amazing. 

To solidify this more going forward and build a lot more trustworthy space for crypto, here are some ideas/ thoughts, including potential for new Crypto applications/ Protocols:

1) We should request all Exchanges to publish an ethics report where they routinely describe these incidents, investigation - even if it's none and all green. This proactive visibility will boost confidence overall and create more trust 

2) There is an opportunity for potential tech innovation - building protocols that can detect shady behavior real time and flag to exchanges/ feds/ users for action. If you are interested in doing so - please ping me \[Shady people please don't dm for seed phrase - else, I will leave a robot behind you to fuck your life\]

3) As a crypto community, we need to raise our voice when we see shady things - raise our voice, create more fuss unless action happens!

With me at that salary my wife could work part time instead of carrying the weight of the financial duty. There’s a small chance we could move to the city the job is in, but my wife doesn’t really want to do that. Also I would have to commute with a personal vehicle. 

I am leaning toward the federal job but I would like to hear your opinions. Thanks!",finance,1658524587
personalfinance,How do I start saving/making money while still attending university on my own dime?,"I am an 19 year old completely independence University student who works two jobs to support myself. One is federal minimum wage part time and one is $15 an hour full time. I Still live paycheck to paycheck. I have no support system and no family to help me out. I don't know how I can get on my feet to start making my life livable instead of just surviving. I have no investing money to make money and I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I don't make frivolous purchases, I have a reliable vehicle that doesn't require extensive repair, and I live on campus to help with the cost of living. And I'm still living paycheck to paycheck. 

I also don't do any unnecessary travel. But I live in Arizona and attend University in Oregon. The reason I do this is because the University in Oregon can provide me enough financial aid that it's actually less to travel and attend that University then attend any of the in-state universities here. 

I've thought about switching to a University in Arizona because that's where my primary job is, but they're all so much more expensive for me to attend that the monthly cost is more than if I travel every 4 months. The problem is that none of the in-state universities care whether my parents are in the picture or not, they just care that my parents make enought so they can help me while disregarding whether they actually will help me out, which they wont. 

I have applied to over 2000 scholarships and haven't gotten anything.  I even tried fundraising and crowd sourcing and I got nowhere with that. I don't even qualify for any loans (without a CO signer, which I don't have). I have no social or financial support from anyone but myself and I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I have no idea what I'm doing wrong or how to fix it in order to get out of this. I want to attend university not only because you need a degree to be a child counselor (which is what I want to do in life), but also because it's the only thing keeping me sane and semi-enjoying life.",finance,1658528107

personalfinance,"Can my wife and I afford this home? Also, broker questions! (California; first-time buyers)","Hey friends,


Wife and I are DINKs and first-time home buyers in California. The condo we have been interested in for a year suddenly came back on the market for a lot less than it was listed at before, so we're trying to jump on it. 


**Home price:** 

* $525,000 (might be able to get it for $510,000)


**My income:** 

* $85,000 (W2)

* $24,000 to $36,000 (1099; I'm an author so book sales vary yearly)


**Wife annual income:**

* $75,000 (W2)


**Savings:**

* $150,000; we'd like to use only about $100k for a down payment


**Investments:**

* $35,000 in cryptocurrency (was recently $100,000 but the market has dipped heavily due to the war in Ukraine and various other global economic circumstances. Ideally we'd like to just hold it and not sell this low)


**Total debts:**

* $6,000 @ 2.9% remaining on my car

* $10,000 @ 2.9% remaining on her car

* no student loans, credit card debt, medical debt, or anything else


**Credit score:**

* 812 (me)

* 808 (her)


**Can we afford this home?**


Our real estate agent is urgently trying to get us to apply for pre-approval on a mortgage. He recommended two brokers he's worked with. He's #1 in our city and is widely recommended, so I do trust him, generally speaking.


* we were told it's better to go with a broker than a bank because brokers can close on homes in 15 days or so, which is more appealing to sellers. Banks are slower to process the mortgage approval, according to the real estate agent. Is this true? Should I go with a broker or a bank?


* is it okay to apply for mortgage pre-approval through two brokers instead of just one? One of the brokers I spoke with encouraged me to apply to multiple, and said ""your credit will be hard-checked multiple times, but as long as all checks are within a 30-day window, they count as one and it won't effect your credit much""


* both brokers say they can get us between 5.2 and 5.8% APR loans on a 30-year. Does this sound right, for our credit score?

* wife's WASP mother horrified that we would ever consider buying during these interest rates. Best friend, who is a financial advisor, says buy now and refi later when the fed lowers interest. He thinks it's more important to buy now than wait for better rates because he believes they're going to go up a little more, *and* housing inventory in CA is never going to go up, so prices are not going to come crashing down any time soon. What do you think?

solar,Professional panel install and diy battery install?,"I recently learned about Signature Solar's rack mounted batteries. They are less than 1/3 the cost of a regular home battery that would be installed by a professional company, and the DIY setup looks super easy. 30kWh for a similar price as a single Enphase IQ 10 unit.

So now I want to just get panels installed by a company and add in my own battery set + inverter, hook that part up myself, and hire an electrician to just merge the battery inverter with the grid-tied solar inverter to form an AC coupled system. 

This sounds easy in my head. Are there any obvious reasons this would be bad? I would assume that I'd still get the US federal rebate on the storage part. And what questions should I ask of the solar installer? Thanks!

EDIT:
Also, is it dumb to order all the parts myself (say with an unbound solar package) and have a separate team install it? I imagine the biggest issue would be all the warranties are different. I'd have to provide the labor to take down any panels or whatever that needed replacement under warranty. Is that all?",energy,1658531062

# **Markets face what could be the most important week of summer with Fed, earnings and economic data - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/markets-face-what-could-be-the-most-important-week-of-summer-with-fed-earnings-and-economic-data.html)**
*****
&gt; There’s a head-spinning amount of news for markets to navigate in the week ahead, the biggest of which will be the Federal Reserve’s midweek meeting.
*****
&gt; The two largest U.S. companies — Microsoft and Apple — report Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Google parent Alphabet releases results Tuesday, and Amazon reports Thursday. Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook, reports Wednesday. In all, more than a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies are reporting.
*****
&gt; On top of that are several hefty economic reports, which should add fuel to the debate on whether the economy is heading toward, or is already in, a recession.
*****
&gt; “Next week, I think, is going to be the most important week of the summer between the economic reports coming out, with respect to GDP, the employment cost index and the Fed meeting — and the 175 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; Second-quarter gross domestic product is expected Thursday. The Fed’s preferred personal consumption expenditures inflation data comes out Friday morning, as does the employment cost index. Home prices and new home sales are reported Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think what those bigger companies say about the outlook will be more important than the earnings they post. ... When you combine that with the statistical reports, which will be backward looking, I think it’s going to be a volatile and important week,” Grohowski said.
*****
&gt; The run-up to the Fed’s meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday has already proven to be dramatic, with traders at one point convinced a full point rate hike was coming. But Fed officials pushed back on that view, and economists widely expect a second three-quarter point hike to follow the one last month.
*****
&gt; “Obviously a 75 basis point hike is baked in the cake for next week,” said Grohowski. “I think the question is what happens in September. If the Fed is continuing to stay too tight for too long, we will need to increase our probability of recession, which currently stands at 60% over the next 12 months.” A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s rate hiking is the most aggressive in decades, and the July meeting comes as investors are trying to determine whether the central bank’s tighter policies have already or will trigger a recession. That makes the economic reports in the week ahead all the more important.
*****
&gt; # GDP report
&gt; Topping the list is that second-quarter GDP, expected to be negative by many forecasters. A contraction would be the second in a row on top of the 1.6% decline in the first quarter. Two negative quarters in a row, when confirming declines in other data, is viewed as the sign of a recession.
*****
&gt; The widely watched Atlanta Fed GDP Now was tracking at a decline of 1.6% for the second quarter. According to Dow Jones, a consensus forecast of economists expects a 0.3% increase.
*****
&gt; “Who knows? We could get a back-of-the-envelope recession with the next GDP report. There’s a 50/50 chance the GDP report is negative,” Grohowski said. “It’s the simple definition of two down quarters in a row.” He added, however, that would not mean an official recession would be declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which considers a number of factors.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, expects to see a decline of 1.9%, but added it is not yet a recession because unemployment would need to rise as well, by as much as a half percent.
*****
&gt; “That’s two negative quarters in a row, and a lot of people are going to say ‘recession, recession, recession,’ but it’s not a recession yet,” she said. “The consumer slowed quite a bit during the quarter. Trade remains a huge problem and inventories were drained instead of built. What’s interesting is those inventories were drained without a lot of discounting. My suspicion is inventories were ordered at even higher prices.”
*****
&gt; Stocks in the past week were higher. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week with a 2.6% gain, and the Nasdaq was up 3.3% as earnings bolstered sentiment.
*****
&gt; “We’re really shifting gears in terms of what’s going to be important next week versus this week,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “We really had an economic data that was largely ignored. Next week, it will probably equal the attention we pay to the household names that are reporting.”
*****
&gt; # Better-than-expected earnings?
&gt; Companies continued to surprise on the upside in the past week, with 75.5% of the S&amp;P 500 earnings better than expected, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Even more impressive is that the growth rate of earnings for the second quarter continued to grow.
*****
&gt; As of Friday morning, S&amp;P 500 earnings were expected to grow by 6.2%, based on actual reports and estimates, up from 5.6% a week earlier.
*****
&gt; “We have kind of a perfect storm of inputs, pretty deep economic reports across the board, with things that have become important, like consumer confidence and new home sales,” said Hogan “For me, the real tell will be whether the attitude of investors continues to be that the earnings season is better than feared.”
*****
&gt; While stocks gained in the past week, bond yields continued to slide, as traders worried about the potential for recession. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.76% Friday, after weaker PMIs in Europe and the U.S. sent a chilling warning on the economy. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; “I do think the market is pivoting,” said Grohowski. “I do think our concerns at least are quickly shifting from persistent inflation to concerns over recession.”
*****
&gt; The potential for volatility is high, with markets focused on the Fed, earnings and recession worries. Fed Chair Jerome Powell could also create some waves, if he is more hawkish than expected.
*****
&gt; “There are a lot of signs out there about slowing economic growth that will bring down inflation. Hopefully, the Fed doesn’t stay too tight for too long,” said Grohowski. “The chance of a policy error by the Fed continues to increase because we continue to get signs of a rapidly cooling — not just cooling — economy.”

&gt; # August is the worst DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1988

&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 34 years, 1988-2021 with average declines ranging from –0.3% by Russell 2000 to –0.8% by DJIA. For NASDAQ August ranks second worst over the same period with an average gain of 0.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b075626ea3874e2fc116db33a8761fd5/0055cd9c0de3cf55-22/s500x750/15499d85ea532121b439c6e81fa8a9943d381a24.jpg))**

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1988; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998, with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2654ca71d08f8fd0df6b99fb95d9b9a2/0055cd9c0de3cf55-b6/s400x600/43a701788e7e1289967b0870c0c5c46b873c75d6.jpg))**

&gt; In midterm years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve slightly: #8 DJIA and S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1974), #5 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1982). Average losses range from –0.2% for S&amp;P 500 to –1.3% for Russell 2000. Russell 1000 has advanced 0.2% on average in midterm Augusts. All five indexes having winning track records, but losses have frequently been substantially larger than gains. DJIA and NASDAQ suffered double-digit losses in 1974, 1990 and 1998.

&gt; # Third Longest Streak of Negative Bull-Bear Spread on Record

&gt; Last week, over a quarter of respondents to the AAII sentiment survey reported bullish sentiment for the first time in over a month. As the S&amp;P 500 has made a considerable move to the upside, bulls have continued to come back this week rising to 29.6%. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic has now come back within one standard deviation of its historical average and is at the highest level since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072122-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment has fallen in lockstep with the increase in bullish sentiment. After coming in at over 50% two weeks ago, the reading has shed 10.6 percentage points. Albeit improved, bearish sentiment remains well above the historical average and the double-digit two-week decline is actually the seventh of the year. In other words, the sharp drop in bearish sentiment is not exactly unusual compared to other moves this year as it still has further to go until it reaches a more ""normal"" level.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072122-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Regardless, with inverse moves in bulls and bears the bull-bear spread has risen to -12.6. That is the highest reading since the first week of June and, as shown in the second chart below, the 16th consecutive week with bears outnumbering bulls. Clearing two other streaks from the early 2000s, that is now the third longest streak on record behind the 22 and 34-week-long streaks ending in December 1990 and October 2020, respectively.

&gt; Not all of the losses to bears went to bulls. Neutral sentiment also rose this week rising to 28.2% from 26.6% last week. That is the highest level in three weeks as neutral sentiment has generally been less volatile than bulls and bears recently.

&gt; # Declines Abound in Mortgage Data

&gt; Roughly one month ago, the national average for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage peaked above 6%. Since then, the rate has pulled back and stabilized around 5.75% in the past several weeks. Although mortgage rates have stabilized a bit, they remain at some of the highest levels since 2008 and have been heading marginally higher in the past week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-30y.png))**

&gt; Given the slight rise in rates, demand for mortgages continues to predict further weakness in upcoming home sales data as we noted in today's Morning Lineup. The MBA's Mortgage Purchase index released this morning came in at a slightly lower reading than the June 3rd low for the weakest reading in the index since March and April of 2020. This week's low is also below the range from the few years prior to the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-Purch.png))**

&gt; Not only has there been a lower volume of mortgages being applied for, but the actual dollar value of those loans has also plummeted amidst higher rates. As shown below, the average value of purchases reached a high of $460K back in March after a big increase in the first few months of this year. Since then, it has entirely reversed that move with the average value of loans having fallen all the way back down to $406K. That echoes the findings in other recent housing data which has similarly shown declines in home prices.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072022-MBA-Value.png))**

&gt; Higher rates have had an even more significant impact on refinance activity. Following another drop this week, the MBA's index tracking refinancings has now reached the lowest level since November 2000.

&gt; # Speculators Head for the Hills

&gt; As we do each Monday in our Closer report, we reviewed the latest data from Friday's release of the CFTC's Commitments of Traders (CoT) Report. This data shows how speculators are positioned in various assets based on positions in the various futures contracts. One asset that has seen some of the most notable changes of the report in recent weeks has been the S&amp;P 500. As recently as one month ago, that data showed a net 1.29% of open interest was positioned long. Even though the S&amp;P 500 has managed to come off the lows in the past month, positioning has collapsed with a massive move lower meaning there are far more speculators positioned short than long.

&gt; Whereas one month ago the reading was net long, in the latest data as of last Tuesday a net 9.3% of open interest was short. That made for the lowest reading since October 2015. In other words, speculators are positioned more pessimistically now than they were during the COVID crash, during the late 2018 near bear market, or any other time over the past several years. The change in positioning has also been rapid. As shown in the second chart below, that net positioning reading has fallen over 10 percentage points in just 4 weeks. Earlier this year in March there was an even larger 12.5 percentage point decline but prior to that, looking back through the history of this data, such large moves have been much rarer over the past decade than was the case in the 2000s and before. In fact, prior to this year the last time positioning in S&amp;P 500 futures fell double digits in four weeks was all the way back in August 2011. On the other hand, the early 2000s frequently saw moves of this size if not larger.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071922-COT-SP.png))**

&gt; Typically, sentiment data is considered contrarian in nature. In other words, pessimistic sentiment readings are followed by stronger forward performance of equities and vice versa. That has not exactly been the case for this CoT positioning data. Following past declines of at least 10 percentage points, returns have been mixed.

&gt; After declines of similar magnitude, the S&amp;P 500 has experienced modest outperformance over the next week. One and three months out, however, have tended to be weaker with postive returns only half the time with negative returns on an average basis. Over the next month, each of the past four instances have been followed by declines.

&gt; Six and twelve months out have seen the S&amp;P 500 higher two-thirds of the time, but average and median returns are not significantly better relative to all periods.

&gt; In the above chart, 43 years of daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large caps are outperforming smaller companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. Small-caps have historically peaked versus large-caps in late-May to early June and tend to underperform until sometime in the fourth quarter.

&gt; # Best Performers Since Mid-June Low

&gt; Since June 16th, the market has reversed course higher, making the date at least a near-term bottom. From a technical perspective, the Russell 1000 broke through its 50-day moving average yesterday and broke above its upper downtrend line today. The 50-DMA is still moving lower, but this is the first time that the Russell 1000 has been above the 50-DMA since April 20th. However, the index is still 9.7% below its 200-DMA. These moves come as commodity prices have pulled back and earnings season begins.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/Russell-1000-Index-Chart-072022.png))**

&gt; As we highlighted in a Chart of the Day earlier this week, the lagging sectors during bear market declines tend to be the leaders in bear market rallies, which is holding true in the bounce since 6/16. The table below shows the 20 best performing stocks in the Russell 1000 Index since the 6/16 low. As you can see, these stocks are all still down considerably on a YTD basis, declining a median of 50.1%. However, these stocks have rebounded by a median of 42.1% since the low on 6/16. Only one of these stocks is below its 50-DMA, and only two are above their respective 200-DMA. If you think that the bear market has concluded, these would be some of the names worth looking deeper into.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/R1000-Stocks-Best-Since-616-072022.png))**

&gt; On the other hand, the best performing sectors during bear market declines tend to be the worst performing sectors during bear market rallies. Of the 20 worst performing Russell 1000 stocks since 6/16, 14 belong to the energy sector (which has been the best sector on a YTD basis by a wide margin). On a median basis, these 20 stocks are still up 13.6% on a YTD basis, but they've shed 13.7% of their value since the market bottomed in mid June. Notably, these stocks (on a median basis) are closer to their 200-DMAs than they are to their 50-DMAs. If you think that we are currently in a bear market rally that is bound to reverse course, these names would be worth looking deeper into.

personalfinance,Tax Loss Harvesting and Dividends,"I have just done some tax loss harvesting for the first time, claiming about $12,000 in losses (moving funds from VTSAX to VFIAX). I was thinking this would lower my tax bill by about $820 per year for the 4 years until I retire (22% federal and 5.35% state marginal tax rates).  
But now I'm wondering if it will instead offset the ~$3000 in dividends I'll be receiving this year instead (at 15% and 5.35% rates). Meaning I'll only be saving about $610 in taxes each year. 
I have found plenty of articles saying dividends are counted in the ""$3000 of other income"" category instead of being directly off set like capital gains before the $3000 limit, but no where does it specify if the dividends are preferentially reduced before earned income.
I'm hoping some people who have done this in previous years can clear it up for me. Thanks.",finance,1658539541

personalfinance,How much house can we afford?,"I really need a sanity check on our finances. 


My spouse and I have very stable jobs in fields that are recession proof—we will make around 210k this year and about 240k next year combined and likely increase 10-20k each year after. We have been aggressively saving for a house for the past three years and have around 160k in a HYSA (with an amazing 1% interest rate /s.) I contribute the max to my 401k and my spouse does about 12k annually and total have about 280k combined. We don’t have any debt other than 500/month for a car payment with 24 months left—we paid off around 180k of student loans over the past 10 years. Our monthly expenses are about 3-4k.


My last job moved us around quite a bit so I took a new job right before COVID and moved us in with my parents. The plan was to stay with them for 6-12 months while we found a house. We have been so lucky to be able to stay with them and don’t pay any rent, but we help out with groceries and taking care of the house. We’ve put in dozens of offers over the last two years on homes but refused to waive contingencies which was basically required to have your offer accepted. It’s very much long overdue for us to move out and find a house.


The market is changing rapidly near us and houses sales have hit somewhat of a standstill. We want to keep our monthly mortgage payment under $3500, and with taxes in our area (the NE) around 12k per year, we’re focused on houses in the 450-550k range. Until the market corrects (our view of a correction is -10 or -15% from 2019 numbers), the houses in this price range need a lot of work or are turnkey and still go for 100k over asking.


Can we expand our budget? Are we on the right track? We both didn’t have financially stable upbringings so we’re overly cautious with finances and don’t want to screw up. 


Any help is greatly appreciated.",finance,1658543178
personalfinance,Trying to join military but debt in collections is preventing me,"I incurred over $12,000 in debt when I first flunked out of college, and it showed up on my credit check for the military. If I do payments on it, it could affect my security clearance and job choice as I ended up scoring well enough to choose any job I want. 

A little background of what happened after I got the debt: 

I thought I could just escape it when I was 18 and just let it go into collections for 4 years, and ended up forgetting about it and now it has come back to bite me. After I left that school, I paid for my associates out of pocket and now have a credit card that is also up to date so I have no worries about any other debt besides my federal student loans which are in deferment, but I can tackle those myself with repayments and loan forgiveness.

This is completely my fault and I want to pay it off in full so I can get the career I want, it’s just that I do not have $12,000 to leverage against the collections agency to eliminate this debt entirely. I could possibly ask my own parents to loan me this money and offer them a % return on the money they lend me, as with my bonus after I get out of basic (they give me 50% right out of basic) will be about $25,000 before tax. They are probably my best bet as I want to leave for active duty within the next few months and I can get them the money back in 6 months after I get out of basic. 

I can also try to negotiate the amount to pay in full to the collections agency, if anyone has dealt with this as well.

I was just wondering if anyone has any other ideas.

TLDR: Debt is going to prevent me from getting the job I want in the military, and I can ask my parents for the lump sump and offer them a return on top of the principal. Was wondering if anyone has more insight into situations like this or any ideas besides this. Or if anyone has gone through negotiating with collections agencies on lowering a full payment.",finance,1658544884
economy,Is there a way for the U.S. government to lower its government bond interest rate?,"Recently, national debt is becoming a hot topic. I saw Japan have debt over 250% of their GDP, the US 100% of the GDP and stuffs.

However, my understanding is that GDP is a yearly output. Which means, to a private sector point of view, it's like looking at a ""debt to asset ratio"". So, the U.S. leverage its asset at 1:1. I do not see anything wrong with it.

The issue that I see is that the U.S. spent 14% of its tax revenue just to pay the debt interest. Which means, there is something wrong with the U.S. bonds interest rate. It's over 2,97% per year. Meanwhile Japan can do -0,09% per year for 2 years bond.

My goal is to understand how government bonds work. Is it like a floating rate or the moment you purchase a government bond at 2,97% per year, you get that 2,97% per year until the debt is paid in full?",finance,1658545170

CryptoCurrency,Using leverage in crypto is a weapon for the fiat army,"What I could never understand in the crypto world, is this:

If you believe crypto is the future and that crypto will go to infinity compared to fiat, you are acknowledging you are on the other side of the trade of infinite fiat money. 

Therefore if you use ANY leverage in crypto, you are essentially asking the fiat Lords to margin call you. The only way to win the crypto vs fiat war is to have no margin / weakness in fiat. 

You're literally competing against The Fed, but giving The Fed, who has INFINITE money, a way to margin call you. It is insanity. To go long on crypto it is essential that you DON'T have debt, so you essentially are short the entire debt based economy. That is the whole point of bitcoin, to move away from a debt based currency where the currency itself becomes an asset rather than a liability.

I love Saylor, but when he started using loans to buy bitcoin, and advertising this in broad daylight, it goes against everything he preaches about bitcoin. If you BUY and HOLD with no debts, you WIN.....eventually. The whole point of fiat is to keep you in debt, which creates the required demand for the fiat. 

The USD will go to 0 over time, but there have been decades of rate increases and stagflation before. You don't think The Fed can turn on the pain for a few years and watch all these people who admit they are on billions of margin in bitcoin suffer? We're in an actual war, against a 200 year old final boss, playing like a bunch of degenerates.",cryptocurrency,1658550820

personalfinance,Small Windfall in My Early 20s,"I was in a car accident some months ago which resulted in me needing surgery. It was 100% their fault and I got a lawyer. The lawyer has informed me they've settled for $205k (way more than it should've been and way, way more than I was expecting). After paying off the medical bills and all the other fees I'm ballparking around $100k everything said and done. 

I grew up very poor and have never had more than $5000 in my bank account when I was saving for a car. I know this isn't a crazy amount of money but is certainly life changing and I'm not quite sure what to do with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My current situation:**

\~$30k/year income (\~$2500/month) with \~$1500 monthly expenses. For debt I have $3500 on a credit card, $26.5k in FSA student loans, $4500 in a perkins student loan (5%), and $2600 in a personal student loan (10.75% variable). 

Through my new employment I have a retirement fund recently started which is all in a Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund by default. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My plan:**

My first idea was to withdraw it all just to look at it for a while and then redeposit it, but I don't think the bank or government would like that. 

Pay off the credit card, perkins loan, personal loan, and most of the FSA loan. $25k - $30k

My current car isn't the most reasonable for where I live, so I was thinking of something reliable and great for all year around. This can wait until closer to winter months, when hopefully all the prices come down more. $10k - $15k

A dog :) $3k (don't get me started on the apartment's fees)

All the other small quality of life things $1000-$2000

  
Leaving me with $50k - $60k. My original plan was keeping a small amount to mess around with investing and a majority spent on a down payment for a smaller duplex, renting out the other side. After some reading it appears this may not be the best idea so I am some seeking better strategies and review of everything else I have above. I'm also not totally sold on a financial advisor but it probably wouldn't be very hard to convince me. Not afraid of taking on risk. 

Thank you

personalfinance,Getting into more and more debt but I don't think it's all that bad.,"I'm a self supporting doctoral student, meaning I owe the government 45 grand and counting. I thought that eventually I'd buy the duplex I live in from my landlord years from now, but that idea has been moved up very suddenly as my landlord gave me 30 days notice of his intention to sell the property. I called him and told him I'd likely buy the property after meeting a loan officer next Monday. This duplex doesn't cost as much as you think because this is a town small enough that it's not counted on economic statistics and prices haven't changed much in 20 years (then again, the houses haven't changed much either).

Upsides: I have more than enough saved in investments to cover any down payment. My debt already exceeds my net worth which means current high inflation is actually a net gain for me and that will just get better with a mortgage (sarcastic yay). There's already a renter in the other half of the duplex which will cover at least the bulk of the monthly payments as long as he stays. The interest won't be too bad as I have good credit from a decade of always paying the bills and never maxing out a credit card. I live here so I can improve the place in my spare time, namely by putting in a privacy fence in the backyard and putting in a carport and shed for my half of the duplex (other half has the garage). And this is my hometown so I have no problem staying here indefinitely.

Downsides: Interest rates are high at the moment and this is a small rural bank we're talking about so they generally don't even offer floating rate mortgages. I'm willing to bet interest rates will fall over time, but on the other hand I'll be paying this loan for many years and things can always get much much worse. Also, I need to buy home insurance if I'm going to be a landlord because I'll have to deal with some idiot eventually. And, of course, there's the commitment where now I can't just move with a few weeks notice anymore, and I was always hoping for exotic adventures. I'll guess I'll find my adventures near here.

personalfinance,Applying for a car loan with...no prior loan history,"I am looking to buy a new car in the next year or so (assuming the market shortage and MSRP mark ups drop or disappear, perhaps this extends beyond a year).  I've been very fortunate and never had a formal ""loan"" before.  Parents bought my prior cars and I paid them back monthly, but all outside of any formal reported loan.  I rent, and have no plans on buying a house.  My folks paid for my college.  Like I said, very lucky.  

I have been gainfully employed with increasing salary for the last 10 years.  My FICO ranges between 818 and 848 and has for the last 5+ years.  Pre-tax, my monthly income is about $13,000 and my only fixed monthly expenses are rent plus insurance, so about $2,000.  With discretionary spending, let's double that to be safe.  

I'm looking at a wide breadth of cars and I'd prefer to qualify for a low interest rate loan and continue investing rather than paying cash (or significantly paying cash) for a new car.  My question is will I even qualify for a competitive loan with no formal loan or borrowing history?  I'm obviously open to paying partial cash down on a new car and financing a lesser amount, but would prefer to gain in the market on the otherwise full cash spend.  What is the best route to take out a car loan - manufacturer financing, local credit union, national bank?

personalfinance,Does GAP Insurance cover this?,"A year ago, my husband and I had a car we bought in cash die suddenly. It was a 2003 Acura with 285k miles on it, it wasn’t a shock, just inconvenient. Needing a car to go to work, my husband financed a 2015 Nissan Rogue from one of those “we approve everyone” dealerships. As expected, we overpaid on the car but it was the only one they were willing to sell us with a measly $2k down and subpar credit. We were desperate and accepted and now we owe $10k more than the car’s Kelly Blue Book value. We’re ridiculously upside down on this car and I want out. We DID purchase gap insurance for the same length as the note through the dealership. I know I can only get somewhere between $10-12k for the car trading in/selling and our total pay-off value (as of writing this) is $21,320. We financed it for $28k. Is this something GAP insurance can help us with? Or is it only for accidents and such? I tried googling it but I didn’t understand and was hoping someone could dumb down for me.

I was preapproved for a better interest rate (better than the 29% we got now, anyways) on a car through my bank so I was going to a dealership in the morning to discuss what to do to get rid of this overpriced Rogue and into something more reasonably priced like a Nissan Sentra or Nissan Kick. But I don’t know what I should do with the car when we have the new one. Surrender it? Try to trade it in? It just seems like the GAP insurance is a big indicator of that.",finance,1658561766

CryptoCurrency,How the Chinese bank run will benefit crypto.,"With the whole bank run going on in China, citizens there are starting to distrust their current banking system.  


Basically what's happened is many banks under the same investor were giving high interest rate and risk free deposit accounts. Which they now rephrased to be ""investment products"". This means that the state doesn't cover it with their government covered- backed insurance. And the biggest investor of them all (Henan new fortune group) rug pulled the lot of them. They ran away with 6 million dollars worth of deposits. The chairman supposedly ran away with new citizenship to the US.  


There is 2 conclusions we can make out of this. A: the government can rephrase things so they don't have to start the money printer.  
B: You can't really trust CeFi. As they can easily rug pull you and run away with your money.  


Where else to put your money if you can't even trust your government and the financial system as it is right now. My bet is people will be looking elsewhere to keep they hard earned money secure.  
And where else to put it but gold or crypto.

 I am at my first job post college (making 61k pretax, around 50k post tax, no state tax). Monthly income is about 4238 post tax. 
Absolutely need to buy a car because this is not a public transit or pedestrian friendly area to get to work. It’s also unsafe. My budget is to keep it as cheap as possible (under 5k). 
Rent is crazy here: 1700-1800 for a one bed, but found a roomate to get the cost down to 1250 including utilities and internet and trash etc. 
Have about 12400 in student debt (6500 of which at a 5.5 interest rate). 
Planning to give about 3 percent to 401k but employer will match in two years. 
Will enroll in employer’s HDHP insurance should cost around 240 a month. I don’t frequent the doctor (maybe 1-3 times a year). 
How do I handle my money? Do I invest in stocks while paying off debt? I personally hate the thought of debt. I also want to get an MBA so saving for that as well.",finance,1658587203

personalfinance,Student Debt Can’t Go Back to School,"I have close to a $6,000 balance at my college. The balance is from the Fall 2020 school semester and I believe it was closer to $4,000 or $5,000 but late fees have bumped it up. Basically, I had a $0 balance after I used my federal loans. I was not doing well at this time in my life and go severely off track after being an all A student my whole life. In August 2020 I started an outpatient program for substance abuse while I was in school full time. This was during covid so all of my classes were online, but my teachers wouldn’t work with me and told me I needed to get a medical withdraw. I was living on campus and only had one year left to graduate, so I dropped the rehab and stayed in school. I couldn’t function and in October/November 2020 I left the school to attend another substance abuse program in a different state. I was emailing people from the school trying to get a medical withdraw but no one would get back to me and I couldn’t seem to get anything accomplished. All of my teachers and advisors knew that I was in treatment but none of them reached out to see where I had been or if I was coming back or if I needed help withdrawing. I assumed I would be dead soon and it wouldn’t matter, so I just abandoned it. I obviously ended up failing just about all of my classes and my federal loans fell through, leaving me with the $6,000 ish balance. I tried to get treatment 4 times in 12 months and then was homeless for 7 months. So now it’s 2022 and I’ve been sober for a year and I’m ready to go back to school (somewhere else). The problem is because I have a balance my old university will not provide me with my transcripts. I cant get credit for my 2 1/2 years completed unless I pay the balance in full. I work full time but only make $15/hr, hence why I need to go back to school. It will likely take me 2-3 years to pay this off on my own and I want to go back to school before then. I’m looking into applying for loans online but most don’t give the option for a semester more than 12 months ago. What can I do? I’m going to the school on Monday to get more information.",finance,1658589035

personalfinance,Refinancing student loan to improve my credit score,"I came to the US as an international student. I graduated last year and have started repaying my student loan which I took from a bank in india. I took about ₹2,800,000 (about $35k in today's rate). The interest rate is around 11%. Currently, I'm left with a balance of about ₹1,100,000 (about $15k). I was considering getting a loan from a US bank (there are a few which give loans to international students) just to have a loan in the US, which I can repay in the hopes of improving my credit history.


Why did I wait before repaying $20k? 

Initially when I started repaying, I did consider getting the loan refinanced. However the difference in interest rate wasnt much (I got quoted about 8% for $35k). I also borrowed $13k from my parents to reduce the interest I would end up paying. So in these 3-4 months, I paid around $7k from my pocket. 


Why the sudden need to improve my credit score?

I am considering buying a car after my student loan is paid off, which I'm expecting to happen by December. So, I was wondering, will it be wise to take a personal loan for $15k from a US bank, and finish off my loan in India, and keep repaying this loan in the US, to help me improve my credit score? I understand that the credit score will take a hit once I borrow, but when does it rise again, immediately after I repay it completely? Is it a wise financial decision?",finance,1658595733

Any recommendations for finding the best mortgage rate? Negotiation methods/resources? I'm asking for par loan, best APR as many lenders show a great interest rate but tack on high fees pushing up the APR, so I think par APR rate (no points) is the best thing to compare across lenders. I'm using bankrate to triangulate on daily rates and will submit full pre-approval applications within a 14 day period with Citi/Wells/Rocket/Better/SoFi and I'm actually seeing very good APRs for some online only lenders (Orchard/Watermark). Then I'll just pit their offers against each other and request higher lender credits. Any other suggestions? Would 7 pre-approvals be too excessive?

As of 07/23, APRs for 500k 30 yr fixed mortgage ranging form 4.65% (Orchard-online only bank) to 5.125% (Citi). Coming out way below Rocket (APR of 5.665) and other banks in the high 5/low 6% range. 800+ credit, \~60% down on a single family primary residence home.

gaming,Game idea that came to me in a dream.,"OK, my game idea is this. 

You play as a lone crew member on an enormous spaceship with a charismatic (and conventionally attractive) bridge crew, the kinda thing you see in every big budget Hollywood movie, but you are a lowly crew member working down in the depths of the engines, and your job? To do what the bridge crew asks of you and keep the engine working. At least, the engine in your assigned section of the ship. 

Most of the game is general maintenance of the engines, and it's VERY in-depth, like, seen that latest Martincitopants video of that game ""my summer car""? Where you build a car engine in excruciating detail? A bit like that, with each missions briefing being something like ""we've travelled 12.5 light years at maximum burn, assess any wear and tear on the systems in your section and conduct nessecary repairs"" 

But there are special missions where the ship is going into battle, the captain says ""weapons and sheilds at maximum"" well, you gotta be the one adjusting power levels for your section of the ship, fixing jams and broken coils in the rail gun, deciding what systems to divert power from to give the sheilds/weapons/engines the power they need etc... without ever actually seeing the enemy or what's going on outside of your assigned section of the ship, all the melodrama happening over the intercoms and ships communicator. 

The ending ""cutscene"" is 20 minutes long, it consists of waiting in line with the rest of the 500 man crew during a medal awarding ceremony, the disinterested captain doesn't even give you the standard ""for honourable and distinguished service on (the ship name) the alliance/federation/whatever is proud to award you this (medal name) for your bravery in the face of great peril"" instead he pins it on while having insufferable ""witty"" banter with his ""main cast"" bridge crew and moves on without giving you a second thought. Once the cutscene is over the game enters an ""infinite"" mode of regular repair work on another ship that isn't at the forefront of the action or adventure anymore. 

I'm not a game dev, I have no idea how to go about making something like this, as the title says I had a dream about a sci-fi work sim game and wanted to post it so other people can share their thoughts on it.",technology,1658604825
Forex,How Many Rate Hikes Does Quantitative Tightening Equal?,"To assess the overall stance of monetary policy, we need to take into consideration the effects of both the interest rate policy and the balance sheet policy. A natural question then arises: what is the equivalence between interest rate hikes and QT?

This is a challenging question as the experience with QT is limited. historically, there was only one round of QT.

According to a June study published by the Fed, a $2.5tn drawdown in the balance sheet over the next few years would be roughly in line with just over a half-point increase in the benchmark US policy rate — a range in keeping with Fed vice-chair Lael Brainard’s assessment that the central bank’s plans amount to *“two or three additional rate hikes”*. In other words, a year’s worth of QT, or about $1 trillion, is roughly equivalent to a single 25bp rate hike.

Even though the Fed may claim it would be roughly just over 50bps, the actual estimate of the equivalence between interest rate hikes and [QT depends on several factors](https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/policy-hub/2022/07/14/11--how-many-rate-hikes-does-quantitative-tightening-equal.pdf) such final size of the Fed’s balance sheet, the interaction with the demand for liquidity in the financial system and the financial markets condition. Another factor that influences how QT affects interest rates is the maturity structure of Treasury debt.

A [recent paper](https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/policy-hub/2022/07/14/11--how-many-rate-hikes-does-quantitative-tightening-equal.pdf), from researchers at the Atlanta and Kansas City Fed regional banks, claims that in the baseline scenario of a $2.2 trillion passive roll-off over three years, it is equivalent to an increase of 29 basis points in the current federal funds rate during a period of low financial market volatility. **The amount of equivalent rate hikes increases to 74 basis points during a volatile market period.** A hefty blow that could tighten monetary policy more than the Fed expects.

The episode between 2017 and 2019 showed: With rising asset runoff volumes, the tension in money markets was increasing.

investing,Stock Buy Backs…Manipulation or Necessary Hedge?,"As someone fairly new to the traditional markets and their cycles I have a lot of open ended questions about stock buy backs. The majority of things I hear or read are typically negative in sentiment when it comes to a company buying back its own stock. I hear it’s just propping it price up, or in a sense manipulating the market to think it’s a stronger investment than maybe it really is.  Or a combination of they are propping up the price in order to create buy pressure to dump their newly pumped price onto m new investors.

I have a few focused questions and then I will give my opinion on them for everyone to tell me how ignorant I am lol. I honestly would just like some clarity or even a link to something that is fairly non biased fact based regarding the subject.

1. Why do companies buy back stock?

2. Do these companies dump this stock they buy?

3. Does future possible movement by the FED come into play as far price or even their exposure to their holding %?

4. Do companies prey on workers with options as a cheap way to increase their holding % at a discounted rate normally?

*Are buy backs positive or negative? This is kind of subjective but nonetheless *


1. I think buy backs are in place to secure their market share, temporarily support price, and to show confidence to the market.

2. I want to think they don’t dump onto new investors, bc that seems like it would be counterproductive long term. In my head though I always envision corporate greed and would have to say Yes they dump them.

3. This is one that originally made me post this. Personally I can seem them being a position that was taken on xx date, but as inflation and the fed move in the buy backs become more of a lifeline for the value of stock instead of an asset to create gains from.

4. I think yes they prey on workers.

5. I think short term they are negative but if held and used as a hedge could become a huge positive.

personalfinance,I make less after my promotion.,"Good afternoon everyone,

So, I became a nurse 1 year ago. I started with a pretty decent salary (by brand new RN in New Jersey standards). I started at $42 hourly, got raised to $47 hourly after six months, and after 9 months of working there I was offered the position of a clinic manager.

I took the position, which is salaried exempt at $105,000 per year. Plus a $10k bonus annually. The problem is, I actually make slightly less than I did before. A big chunk of my income came from overtime (a reliable overtime -we are always short staffed). Now, I find myself working even longer hours, with more responsibility and a LOT more stress, with nothing to show for it.

Should I just suck it up and do it for another year just to build my resume? Or should I go with what ultimately gains me most income without the risk of burning out?

Before you tell me that maybe I'm not leadership material - trust me, I know. Peter Principle in action and all of that. I make sure that my colleagues are cared for, and that my clinic runs smoothly, but I don't care about climbing the corporate ladder. 

TL;DR - New nurse complains about being promoted but not seeing a significant increase in his income even though he works longer hours.

CryptoCurrency,Next week is going to be very brutal for Crypto. Let's take a look at the many events happening that influence crypto.,"After we have had a bit of a relief, now shit us actually getting real as we are going to enter probably one of the worst or at least most interesting week for the stock markets, crypto and the world in general. So you gotta keep an open mind throughout the week and be ready for everything. Here the list of most important events:

1. Earnings, a lot of Earnings. As it's earnings season right now at the stock market and we already had a dull with snapchat falling -35% and losing billions. Now it's actually getting real with much of big tech like Apple and Microsoft reporting. Bad will cause stock markets to melt and with a high correlation also crypto.

2. FOMC. This is probably the biggest event of the week where we will actually get our rate hike, whether it's 75bps or 100bps is to be seen. A 100bps would definitely cause havoc over the markets as already a 75bps last month did make markets melt.

3. GDP Q2 numbers, this could be the most important event too if its done in this week, which is not exactly clear yet (may be early August) but if the Q2 number like the Q1 number would be in the minus then the US would officially be in a recession and even if most economists knew that, the constant lying from politics could have made it unclear for many.

4. A recently added event is the US dividing whether they should declare an health emergency over monkeypox. Just now the WHO declared one and Biden administration said to do it on Monday. I'm not expecting it to be big news but certainly some minor panic.",cryptocurrency,1658610994

stocks,Luck vs. Talent: Analyst Estimates for Individual Equities &amp; What it Means for Stock-Picking,"I've been a big proponent of Upstart stock because of the proven benefits. Its AI lending program is statistically superior to those that rely on traditional FICO scores. Their focus on subprime consumer loans is but a foray into lending markets that are orders of magnitude larger, such as car loans and mortgages. I was not a fan of their pandering to Wall Street by removing loans from their balance sheet, but I don't think it will derail them from their long-term goals. Best of all, their stock has been trading as if they're going to zero, when their financials are absolutely stellar. 

On TIKR Terminal, which I highly recommend for long-term, fundamental investors, analysts tend to agree, with estimates guiding for solid growth. However, they also predict serious setbacks in 2025, which would put a huge dent in their progress:

2022           2023          2024           **2025**         2026

Revenue:          1,083.23    1,379.37    2,107.31    **1,379.00**   1,57.00    *CAGR 9.3%*  

*% Change YoY*    *27.7%         27.3%        52.8%*         ***(34.6%)***     *12.2%* 

This seems very strange to me, and I can't find any sort of reasoning behind it. For one, we're witnessing the credit cycle rollover as I type this. The macro environment couldn't be worse for them. Still, they are maintaining growth and have stabilized their lending program. Additionally, their AI is learning at a faster pace than ever as this cycle provides reams of data that might've otherwise taken years to accrue. What could possibly be the driver of such a catastrophic shortfall, specifically in the year 2025? I have no other idea outside the expectation for a repeat of this year's downcycle, with Upstart again falling prey to a collapse in debt markets. 

But the thing is, no one can predict these things--like, not in the slightest. 

My larger questions, therefore, are what goes into guidance like this, and how accurate are analysts at these ranges? My gut tells me the answers are 'random bullshit' and 'not very', but I honestly don't have access to the data. There are countless analysts, some better than others. I don't know which ones factored into the consensus estimates for Upstart on TIKR, not to mention the limitless estimates that go into stocks around the world, across a multitude of platforms, and at varying timeframes. 

There's no way they can predict what will happen with a company in ten, fifteen, thirty years. But even three years out seems impossible, quite frankly. Just look at the last three years, during which we experienced the fastest crash in history due to a global pandemic, the fastest recovery in history due to loose monetary policy that extended FAR past its expiration date, and therefore the biggest inflation shock in over 40 years. Zero people could have foreseen these macroeconomic events, let alone the effects they would have on individual companies. 99% of Reddit guaranteed the second Great Depression in April 2020--a year in which $SPY ended up rising 18%. 

So my last question to everyone here is: How do you manage guidance and estimates in spite of their horrific track record? 

A small slice of people are far better than others when it comes to investing. I tend to believe that this has to do more with emotional control and composure than intelligence and foresight regarding macroeconomic trends. There are traders who can use technical analysis to make 300% in a year, but they'll rarely beat a long-term investor that sits on their hands and lets their winners run upwards of 100X. That's why I keep buying during times like these, when people can't manage the red in their accounts and the comparisons between current totals vs ATHs. 

At the same time, sticking with a select group of stocks requires *some* sort of foresight, right? Or else, why would you pick that stock in the first place? To go back to the original example, I'm gobbling shares of Upstart now because it's not only fundamentally cheap, but also specifically *because* it's riding the downturn, and I want to buy closer to the bottom than the top. Also, they're miles ahead of any other AI lender, perhaps even decades, aside from maybe Pagaya, which operates in another sector anyhow. But I wouldn't deign to predict what's going to happen on a year-to-year basis. 

In the end, I wonder how much investing relies on luck vs. ability. The old saying ""time in the market beats timing the market"" sounds great, but not to the investor who threw their life's savings into tech stocks in November 2021. This is straight up luck, as inflation had just emerged as an issue, and no one truly knew it would be this pernicious--least of all the Fed. If these first-time investors view this experience as indicative of the market as a whole, they might eat their losses and never come back. Given their limited experience, were they bad investors, or simply unlucky? 

FWIW, I'm down 50% from the highs. I've always believed volatility is the price you pay for returns, and that the market over the long term goes up. But past performance has no bearing on future returns--or does it? Have my years of success indicated that I have a knack for picking stocks? Could Warren Buffett possibly have been lucky? How much experience is required to claim that one's success or failure is due to skill or a lack thereof? 

**TLDR: TIKR Terminal provides analyst estimates for each company. Some estimates go out as far as 2026 or 2027. Do you think analysts can make estimates for individual companies, let alone macroeconomic trends, with anything resembling accuracy? And for those that can, how much of their success can we attribute to 'talent' vs. 'luck'? What are the metrics that distinguish these features?**",finance,1658615413

I'm going to argue to say that this week is the week that most of us been waiting for. I'm predicting we will see a few major crashes this week especially if the earnings reports are terrible and and if a recession is announced. 

Once that happened I can totally see us going around the $15,000 BTC levels and the 800 to 700 ethereum levels. Once we reach down to those levels or below people are going to start snatching up crypto like no other. After this week, the next FED meeting will be September. 15-16, so we will have a whole month without the FED fud. Now this doesn't mean we can't get any more terrible news during that month but I'm feeling like our odds are pretty good right now after this week.

Also, after this week I expect some major announcements coming up about the ethereum merge, and this is when I'm going to assume some big announcements are going to happen from institutions regarding crypto. 

Now, there's still the possibility of us crashing in September if the economy keeps going downhill but whether you're a long-term hodler, or not, this could be a good opportunity for nice long swing trade or to get your average down or to get in the game at a good price. Either way, I wish you guys nothing but the best and I hope you guys have some Fiat ready for this week.  

Edit: those of you saying this is a trust me bro post I'm basing this off the FED meeting dates and the bad news that's coming this week with the earnings reports and monkey pox

Also, if you want to do some due diligence please look at the FED dates and  it is correlated to the Bitcoin chart and you will see a correlation and those of you talking about oh well the FED meeting actually boosted the market last time guess what Disney announced that they were joining the metaverse with the Matic so there ya go.

CryptoCurrency,A System has been put in place for many years to Oppress your wealth. Blockchain and NFT technology are here to Break the Cycle….,"*TL;DR: From Banking, to Stocks, to Real Estate, everything is designed for you to win a little, and them to win A Lot. This is a system designed to keep them in power, and Blockchain will eliminate the need for most of the Financial Industry.*

To fully understand how Decentralized Finance is going to restructure the entire Financial System, you must first realize that the System put in place now, has only been made to benefit the creators. Our generation, and many generations before us, have been *trained* to invest a certain way so that it benefits the ones in power. This is Centralized Finance….

*Let’s talk about Banks.*

Do you know what a Bankers Job is?

To get you to do these 3 things:
   *1) Get you to invest as much as possible.
    2) Get you to hold it there as long as possible.
    3) Give you as little as possible in exchange.*

They take your money, and flip it 10 times over, while giving you maybe 0.01% interest. *Thank you, come again!*

If you want to send someone money, from your bank to theirs, your bank has to send their bank the money. And they generally use 1-2 middleman to do so. All of those entities are taking a cut out of your Money. With Blockchain now, there is no need for middlemen. My wallet sends to your wallet, and done. 

*Let’s talk about the Stock Market.*

In the Stock Market, you have brokers, Hedge Funds and Money Managers (among many other snakes). You can’t actually buy any Stocks without a broker. Unless you invest into some type of fund. 

Brokers want you to invest as much as possible, and Hold it for as long as possible. While also trading along the way, this is how they make their fees. Meanwhile, they only have to hold 5% of your stocks on their books. 

*Wait, What?*

Yes, Fidelity, Robinhood and these guys take your money, and go reinvest 95% into whatever they want, generally lending those assets to other Hedge Funds and Institutions. *(I guess the same goes as well for Centralized Exchanges)*. 

You don’t have an IRA *sir*, you have an IOU…..

Now, Hedge Funds and Market Makers are even Worse. These Scum take your money and not only leverage it like brokers, but legitimately Bankrupt struggling companies while making a massive profit doing so. They take the money you give them, and buy the Stock you want to hold, while *Shorting* those same exact positions. Generally Hedge Funds are just for the Rich though, which is interesting because it means *ALL* of us are being manipulated from the Top to the Bottom…..

Blockchain Technology will eliminate *ALL* of this shit show mess of Wall Street. You can’t cheat the Blockchain, and all the manipulation would be able to tracked and traced on a Public Ledger. Trust me bro, the powers that be Do *NOT* want Blockchain and Crypto to succeed because it would Decimate their entire Game which keeps them bleeding the retail investors. They are making *TRILLIONS* off of this Scam, and have been for decades now….

Don’t believe me????

Have you ever heard of a Company called Overstock dot com?

They were having their stock manipulated for years. The Ex-CEO even went so far as to create another stock exchange on Blockchain, and tried to move the stock onto it so he could prevent the manipulation from continuing. The SEC tried to sue him and essentially blocked it from happening. His company’s stock was continually manipulated until they were able to distribute an NFT dividend which ended up Squeezing a bunch of funds who had heavily Shorted it over the years. That was back in 2019….

*Now I want to talk about Real Estate.*

To begin with, you do “own” your property, but the way I look at it…. We’re just leasing it. 

Why I say that is Property Taxes. You can’t own a piece of Land without paying Property Taxes. And Property Taxes always go up, Just like Rent….

To buy a Property to begin with, you need either 
   A) A lot of Fiat, Or 
   B) A Lender.

Generally most people use a Lender, and take a 30 year home loan. These are typically around 4-6%. And the way Amortized loans work, the Lender gets their money First. Go look at a graph of a 30 Year Fixed Rate loan. They basically made all their interest in the first 10-15 years. And they want you to Put up 10-20%.

*(Also, the lender has a broker, and they take their cut as well…..)*

So it’s a very low risk situation for Banks because well, it’s not even their Money. *(Remember how Banks work?)* They take your money, then lend it out to people at a 4-6% interest rate, while lean holding the title against *your* equity. You get behind on a couple payments? The bank seizes your home and equity. 

*Nice doing business with you sir, please come again….*

Peer to Peer lending could help so many people get property around the world. And we would be the ones directly profiting on that. Since it is *our* money being lent out anyway, we might as well benefit from it instead of just making bankers rich. And Imagine Your money invested helping people in 3rd World situations acquire the funds they need for shelter and water, without the need for a “credit check”. 

Blockchain and Peer to Peer lending can revolutionize the entire Mortgage Industry, but again, we are taking away from the powers that be. So they will stop at nothing to end Blockchain, unfortunately for them Crypto is here to stay and now the clock is ticking….

So after you get approval for your Loan, you need a Real Estate agent. The agents take their cuts around 5-6% of the homes Value, Off the Top.

Then once you get approved for the purchase, you have to pay a company for Escrow. Then you have to pay another company to Hodl your title. *Why can’t I just Hodl my own title???*

NFT technology will eliminate the need for Escrow or title companies, as everything can just be done by Smart Contracts.

All of these entities take a piece of your cash along the way. Which would all be irrelevant by the use of Blockchain.

To conclude, it drives me crazy when people say “Crypto has no use case”. Blockchain and NFT *are* the Use Case to rewrite the Financial Industry, and they are proven. End of story.",cryptocurrency,1658633812

personalfinance,Should we buy a house now or wait two-six months?,"Id like to preface this by saying that we have never owned a home and are newbies to the home buying process so any information is so greatly appreciated.

My husband and I are looking to buy a two family home in Syracuse (we are going to live in one and rent the other out). The homes we are looking at are between 110k-160k. 

Currently we are in a month to month rental that we can live in until December. Ideally we’d like to be homeowners by then.

We are wondering if we should look to buy a house now or wait a couple of months.

Reasons we are thinking of waiting:

1. I read an article about homes being more expensive in the summer since families want to move before their kids start school and then homes are generally cheaper after September.

2. The currently 5% interest rate. Wondering if it’ll go down in a few months or not.

3. Home prices. I read that even though there are less buyers because of the interest rates, sellers haven’t gotten the memo yet and are still pricing well over the home values. So home prices may go down in the next couple of months.

Any thoughts/comments about whether we should start looking now or wait is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1658638172

investing,Misconceptions about inflation.,"I see a lot of naive statements about the effects of inflation, mostly statements that it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. This isn't necessarily the case.

During periods of high inflation, the purchasing power of a given amount of money falls. Ergo, those who own cash lose money while those who hold real assets are normally unaffected. Noteworthy is people are still buying bonds whose expected returns is lower than inflation, because holding these bonds is still better than holding cash. This extends to all paper assets, so if you hold stocks like a hedge fund you may still have a net loss even if you make money this year, but a landlord will likely be less affected as he still collects the rent even if he must raise prices and/or put expansions on hold. Farmers and dealers of staple necessities like water and medicine will be totally unaffected as the population needs a fixed amount of the stuff and will pay any price needed.

Also recall that many people, like me, have a negative net worth due to a lot of long term debt. These people are beneficiaries of inflation as the value of their debts outstanding falls, so don't let the economy deter you from going to college and such. On the reverse side, the people who issued all this long term debt (mostly banks of all shapes and sizes) will be incurring a loss as inflation exceeds the expected return of the loans. Retirees with large nest eggs saved up will be incurring losses as the value of their fortunes fall.

And yes, the Feds are deleting all that money they printed. They are doing so with bond trading. During Covid they printed money cheaply by simply placing orders for corporate bonds on the internet using money they simply credited their accounts. Now some of those bonds are maturing and the money paid back to the Feds, and they have raised the Federal Funds Rates (the interest rates they both lend and borrow at). This had the immediate effect of increasing the amount of people lending the Feds money and decreasing the amount of people borrowing from the Feds. All this extra money is simply deleted, and since it all happens electronically operational costs for this is pretty low.",finance,1658654136

Bitcoin,How Fedimint Scales Bitcoin Custody,,cryptocurrency,1658656465
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto payments are here to stay despite the volatility, FUD in the air","Its been a brutal past couple of months for the crypto space, and from the way the wind is blowing things could get a lot worse before they get better. Despite crypto's rally last week in response to the ETH merge announcement set for September, the broader macroeconomic environment looks, well, terrible. Bearish catalysts to look out for this week include:

* Tech earnings, which are forecasted to be disappointing
* More Fed interest rate hikes
* Scaled back 2022 GDP forecast
* Celsius' collapse+sagging trust in crypto institutionals

And thats the short list. So where's there a ray of hope for LT hodlers? The short answer is in crypto payments, which despite the swirling FUD is experiencing a windfall as one of the few blockchain utility use-cases that is still speaking to investors. 

Don't believe me, well this weekend TIME magazine published an article about the future of cryptocurrency. A clear consensus emerged around the fact that greater regulation and broader adoption by institutions are converging around the field of cryptocurrency payments. This is backed by the numbers too; Vantage Market Research recently published findings that the crypto payments app market is expected to witnessed 13.4% CAGR through 2028. Put simply, thats bullish af---there's lots of room to grow here. 

The crypto payments market is looking increasingly crowded as veteran providers like BitPay and Circle vie for market segment with innovative up-and-comers like Oobit, which recently released a sleek B2B2C payments app. Ultimately, greater competition should drive down rates and lead to a better product/set of services for the consumer. 

Use cases for crypto payments are wide, and include everything from social payments to foreign remissions to new transaction methods for enterprises. I've seen multiple recent articles hailing the three-digit ROIs reported by businesses that have introduced crypto payment capabilities. The stats speak for themselves.

So as markets are going from bad to worse, I'm hodling my current positions and meanwhile exploring new opportunities that are undergirded by concrete and enduring use cases.

personalfinance,"Cash, Assets, and Debt help","Need some opinions on how to manage all of the above and below.  I’m 48 and have a family of 5. Daughter is starting med school, other daughter is a senior in HS, shunny boy is 10. Wife and HS daughter work. Gross household income is around $225k. 

We have 3 houses, our primary residence has a mortgage of $465k, worth about 815k (Zillow) but I doubt I could get that and no plans to sell anyway. 

First rental is rented by older daughter and he friends.  Mortgage &amp; expenses are $2200 (includes PMI) and rent is $2500. Mortgage balance is $340K and it would probably sell for $525K. 

Second rental is rented by a family friend. Mortgage balance is $360K (includes PMI) and I could probably sell for $475K. Rent is $2100 and loan payment + expenses = $2000. 5% down on the original loan so the payments are high. 

I’m thinking I don’t really want to sell the rentals, even if I could get some decent profits, because I’d get taxed heavily and because I don’t want to put the tenants (esp. my daughter) out.   Plus the interest rates are low on all of the properties (2.8-3.8% range). 

Also have 3 car payments. 
35K remaining at 4.9%
17K remaining at 3.5%
20K remaining at 1.9%

401K at 350k and 200k in cash.  Most of the 401K is in money market. I’ve been afraid of getting burned and looking for a market low for 2 years before putting it into mutual funds. 

Lot of other expenses typical of an active family and HS daughter will head to college in a year or 3 (she might do classes at a local community college and play soccer for a year or 2). We save about 4k/month.  

I like having the cash around, but am I a fool for not paying off the cars and paying down the mortgages to zero PMI? 

Jobs are relatively stable. Just looking for some free advice on how to maximize things. Might buy some IBonds as I favor stable investments.  Any input is appreciated.

This week was able to leverage my condo for a $50k HELOC @6%. The plan is to pay off $35k immediately then the remaining as the 0% is coming due. The plan is to make interest only payment for 6-10 months allowing me to save as much money as possible during this period. I will then revert to an aggressive payoff schedule once I have over $25k in savings. ($5k currently) I invite anyone to critique this plan or offer insight. At $122k a year I really thought I’d be comfortable. I have even resorted to driving Uber 10-12 hours a week to make extra cash. I guess $122k is the new $60k salary.

personalfinance,Brokered CD vs Bonds - Is one better than the other?,"In my brokerage account I can invest in CDs or in Bonds.

My understanding is that they are functionally equivalent.

A Brokered CD is not the same as an ordinary CD, because with an ordinary CD you can redeem it before maturity and just loose the interest you would have gained by holding to maturity. A Brokered CD must be sold on the open market, and if interest rates are rising, it is possible to lose not only the interest you would have gained but also the principal. Conversely, if interest rates decrease you can have a gain in capital.

Is there anything else to take into account while deciding between a brokered CD and bond?

For example, are bonds more liquid than brokered CDs?",finance,1658674739

investing,Shiller CAPE vs Expected 10 Year Future returns. A Regression Analysis on 12 indexes based on MSCI Data,"First a bit of background: This work was done solely by me over this weekend. I'm not a professional, nor have I attempted anything similar in the past. In fact, I wasn't aware of R squared before this weekend - so take everything with a major heap of sale. If there's mistakes and such, please feel free to point them out. It's also possible that everything I did was wrong and this is just gibberish. The point of this was to create an exercise for myself as well as create discussion online regarding attractive market options. There could also be a lot of simple mistakes there, but due to time constrains (weekend is finishing) I'm forced to post it online now. If you guys like it and if this even makes sense, I might do something similar in the future again

Also, I will happily share the Excel with the raw data and analysis. However, I do not know how to. I do not want to share from my personal office online account as I want to keep my reddit profile at least semi-private. If someone can please help me out, I would very much appreciate it. I'm sure my data and analysis needs a lot more work and we can make a editable version where multiple people can contribute

Data: Was compiled using freely available MSCI data found online. Historical PE by country MSCI Index was sourced from [Barclays](https://indices.barclays/IM/21/en/indices/static/historic-cape.app)

(data available for download). Then I found corresponding index historical data (took me a lot of time to find I might add) through [MSCI End of Day Index Data Search](https://www.msci.com/end-of-day-data-search). The website is very slow, but it works. For most of the developed markets, the data goes back to 1982, which I thought was sufficient enough to come to reasonable conclusions

Methodology: Using the data obtained above, I calculated 10 year annualized average return for each month (for example Jan 1982 to Jan 1992, Feb 1982 to Feb 1982) for each of the 12 MSCI Indexes: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, UK and USA. Then I used graph on Excel to make the line of best fit through regression analysis for each one of those markets. Because I was using 10 year returns, I could only use the 10 year annualized returns until June 2012 and run Regression analysis on CAPE vs returns until 2012 only as well. For developing countries, like Brazil and India the data set was much more limited, therefore I was forced to use 5 year returns. I also calculated the average 10 year return as well as the standard deviation for the 10 year returns. Then I ran a regression analysis on each of the data sets.

Results:

&amp;#x200B;

|Country|Current CAPE|Avrg Historical Cape|Average 10 YR Return|StDev of 10YR Return|Expected Future 10 Year Return|Line of Best Fit|R2 Squared|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Australia|20.45|20.48|5.87%|4.02%|6.18%|y = -0.0027x + 0.1149|0.54|

|Germany|16.67|22.87|6.43%|4.86%|8.59%|y = -0.0031x + 0.1376|0.37|
|Hong Kong|16.62|20.15|8.29%|7.02%|10.32%|y = -0.0051x + 0.188|0.13|
|India|28.19|11.54|7.68%|12.22%|4.27%|y = -0.0054x + 0.1949|0.26|
|Japan|20.24|42.29|2.31%|6.40%|6.69%|y = -0.0016x + 0.0993|0.23|

|Singapore|13.12|22.20|4.94%|5.20%|8.37%|y = -0.0031x + 0.1244|0.13|
|UK|16.67|17.54|4.68%|5.24%|5.57%|y = -0.006x + 0.1557|0.25|
|USA|28.51|24.31|8.29%|5.04%|5.46%|y = -0.0052x + 0.2029|0.76|

 

Note: India and Brazil were calculated on a basis of 5 year annualized return due to the lack of data. Unlike other indexes that start in 1982, Brazil index data starts in May 2011 (earliest CAPE available) and India in August 2003.

Analysis: The data was surprising to say the least. My inspiration came from the book ""A random walk down wallstreet"" where the author Markiel mentions that CAPE Ratio, and that it is the best predictor of future returns. In the book, I believe he mentions that about 45% of the returns in the US stock market can be explained by CAPE Ratio. If my understanding is correct, he must be referencing the R squared. I do not remember which data set he used, but I wasn't able to get similar results.

Australia: Seems right around historical averages. Nothing too noteworthy, expect maybe a strong correlation (R2)

Brazil: It is the only country with expected negative returns. Brazil data sat was also the most limited, therefore it is hard to make any significant conclusions based on available data. Brazil also has the highest standard deviation. It seems that the Brazilian market has been insanely volatile in the 21st century. I did not run a Regression Analysis because I thought it was moot

Canada: Now this tripped me up big time. In fact, the only reason why I included line of best fit formula was for Canada. Canada has **POSITIVE** relationship on Cape vs Expected returns. The higher the CAPE, the higher is the 10 year expected return. I double checked the numbers. Unless I'm making a mistake somewhere that I'm not aware of, Canada is a fluke.

Europe: Nothing noteworthy with Europe MSCI Index,

Germany: Probably the best/safest investment out of all based on this analysis. German MSCI index seems to be below historical averages, has a pretty strong R2 and is posed for solid growth in the next decade from now

Hong Kong: For those wanting to take a risk, this might be a very good opportunity. I'm not at all surprised by this data, and it makes sense on an intuitive level as well. In the 2000s USA went through strong economic growth, but the stock market languished. After 2009 it went on an incredible bull run ending only now. China has spent the 2010s positioning itself from factory of the world to a world-wide brand. Tencent and other companies are now a household name. I took a short glance at the Hang Sek 50 index, and a lot of the top stocks are also Value companies. After tencent, there's a list of 4-5 banks. I checked their revenues and profits online and they have all grown massively in the last decade. Meanwhile the stock market has not moved. Of course banks are generally low P/E but it seems like the Chinese companies are highly undervalued even accounting for that. That being said, any investor should be careful to due high interference of the CCP. As for myself, I would consider buying a small leveraged position, something like Yinn 3x leveraged China ETF. However I will need to research more

India: India went through a massive bull run in the 2010s, along with USA. It is only the cyclical nature of the markets that the best performers of the previous decade tend to be lackluster in the next one. I'm not very bullish on India, especially with the sky high valuations

Japan: Japan is just a mess. Their CAPE systematically reached 50s 60s 70s and even peaked at 80s in the 2000s, they were overvalued for a long time even after the asset bubble burst. They seem like they're undervalued now, but honestly I don't think I know enough to say anything meaningful about Japan. If I were to speak out of my ass, I would say they were insanely overvalued from the 1980s all the way to 2010s so CAPE at 20 is not undervalued, but valuations catching up with reality. I would personally steer clear.

Netherlands: Interesting to see that Netherlands is overvalued next to its European peers. I do not know the reason for it. Needs more researching

Singapore: Another very good bet for the future IMO. Yes, R2 is low, but it is a developed economy and they have traditionally been very business savvy. I would definitely look more into investing into Singaporean Markets

UK: Have to say, quite surprised by this one. FTSE 100 hasn't returned much at all since the year 2000. I thought it would mean they're undervalued. but doesn't seem so. Interesting to note that while FTSE 100 (big-cap) stagnated, FTSE 250 (mid-cap) brought in stellar results, tripling since 2000. Definitely warrants further investing. I've also seen some evidence online that only FTSE 100 specifically is undervalued, so maybe a big cap play in the UK?

USA: Well, I think the amazing bull run is dead. For stellar growth in the coming years, we will have to go down much lower in the near future. Some people say it will happen, others think we're close to the bottom. If it's the latter, I personally wouldn't expect the returns of the last decade and a half going forward. In 2008/9 MSCI CAPE bottomed at 13. We're more than double that now. American markets can't grow exponentially to the corporate profit growth rate anymore without detaching from reality, so something has to give. Either we see a crash and another bull cycle, or a slow upwards growth.

Interestingly enough, USA has the highest R2. I wonder if it's due to highest pricing efficiency due to the largest investor participation.

Criticisms:

The obvious criticism of Shiller CAPE is Excess Cape. We are in an era of record low interest rates even with the recent hikes. A lot of people will rightfully point out that comparing current values to historical values is at least not painting the full picture i.e. more expensive stocks now make more sense than they did in the 90s. However Shiller CAPE is still one of the most powerful tools at our disposal for predicting future growth

The other criticism is the limitation of data. I couldn't get any meaningful information about emerging markets. Even for the developed markets, looking 1982-2012 might be too limited.",finance,1658676151

CryptoCurrency,Why max supply is often a lie,"**TL;DR**: You should never blindly trust the maximum supply for a token that uses a rewards pool for miners/validators that will eventually run out. There is a high chance their ""fixed"" maximum supply will need to be adjusted in the future. Most of these networks are being fed subsides like heroin, and they expect the miners/validators to survive on negligible transaction fees alone once the subsidy pool abruptly runs out.

Some of them can survive post-subsidy, but we won't find out until a bear cycle after their subsidies run out.

-------------------

##The issue with networks that have a maximum token supply and pre-allocated rewards pool

I've been spending a lot of time on Messari and TokenTerminal studying tokenomics for dozens of cryptocurrencies. One pattern that has come up over and over again are networks that have:

1. A maximum token supply coupled with
1. A rewards pool that will eventually run out
1. With no realistic plans to wean off the subsides

**This is a huge red flag because when the rewards pool runs out, they will need to find a new source of revenue to pay miners/validators. The transaction fees are often 100x smaller than what's needed to sustain the network. There's a huge chance the supposedly-fixed maximum supply will not hold.**

Most of these platforms are trying to grow their networks as fast as possible by attracting users with their low transaction fees, which are only enabled through rewards subsidies. Many of their documentations and roadmaps suggest that transaction fees will cover the revenue. However, transactions on low-fee networks are usually 20-200x smaller than what's needed to economically sustain the network. These plans work if the networks can grow their total transaction fees by 20-200x from their current peak, and **remain higher than that during bear markets**. That's extremely difficult and often impossible in many cases. Directly increasing fee schedules drives away activity, decreasing overall TPS and fee generation. And many of these networks already get congested if you increase throughput by even 20x, let alone 100x.

In addition, transaction fees are highly-volatile and do not provide a constant revenue stream for miners and validators. Without subsidies, rewards during bear cycles will collapse, and miners/validators/participants will leave. This causes rewards and security to collapse even more, leading to a feedback loop of declining activity. Thus networks also need constant issuance to keep the network stable. This requires removing the fixed max supply.

Nearly all supply-inflation discussion threads are dominated by people who just blindly assume token inflation will suddenly end because the documentation says so. That's a naive assumption. Some blockchains will succeed in keeping their max supply; others won't. You can't know for sure until years after the subsidies run out.

---------

##Let's look at some case studies of token supply models

**We don't know whether these networks can succeed without changing their tokenomics until years after their subsidy runs out. They have to survive for at least 1 bear cycle post-subsidy. Some of them will succeed and others won't. All I'm saying is that you shouldn't blindly trust the max supply.**

In the examples below, I define ""**issuance**"" as an increase in **circulating/liquid supply**, not by token minting. Minting does not affect a token's supply economics until the tokens are actually put into circulation. Note that Messari.io is not 100% accurate due to networks deviating from their documented plans, but it's usually close enough to make fair estimates of supply running out within a year.

**Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin - Sustainable models**

* **Tokens that have no max supply and continuous issuance have a sustainable token supply model.**
* Ethereum's token burn from its high transaction fees is expected to be enough to offset its token issuance after the merge, so even with no max supply, it's expected to have nearly zero net issuance. Validators will receive a steady flow of revenue even when transactions dwindle. This will work even during bear markets. **I predict many networks will attempt to switch to this tokenomics model.**

**Polygon - Model likely not sustainable past 2024**

- According to [Messari.io](https://messari.io/asset/polygon/profile/supply-schedule), MATIC had 67% inflation in 2022, 31% in 2021, 13% in 2022.
- MATIC has a 1.2B token pool reserved for validator rewards that's [expected to run out 5 years after launch](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/maintain/validator/rewards/). This issue has been brought up many times across various forums, and the Polygon Foundation has ignored it. **It's not sustainable past 2024** unless the Foundation pays from their own funds.
- My hunch is that they don't want to admit 10B isn't going to hold as the max supply. **MATIC transaction fees need to grow ~30x to cover validator rewards.**
- Remember when Sunflower Farm congested the network in Jan 2022 and fees shot up 50x? Now imagine another 30x increase in fees on top of that during congestion.
- Polygon is already fairly centralized with its 100-validator limit. It can't easily lower rewards and risk reducing its centralization even further.

**Avalanche - Model likely not sustainable past 2030**

* The Avalanche networks are sustained by high inflation, which is how they keep transaction fees low. Validators are paid by a pre-allocated staking rewards pool, and those staking rewards account for a HUGE amount of the annual inflation.
* The [vesting schedule](https://messari.io/asset/avalanche/profile/launch-and-initial-token-distribution) leads to a 30% increase in supply in 2022, followed by a 22% increase in 2023.
* **Transaction fees are burned, but the transactions fees are so low that the [burnt amount is unnoticeable](https://burnedavax.com/).** Burns are in the tens of millions of dollars ([TokenTerminal shows $10M in annual fee revenue](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche)) while issuance is 100x greater in the billions of dollars. **Fees would need to be 100x higher to offset token issuance.**
* AVAX issues [45M tokens per year starting at 2025](https://messari.io/asset/avalanche/profile/supply-schedule) until it reaches its 720M max supply around Apr 2030. Unless fees grow 100x higher by 2030, AVAX's supply distribution model is going to break in 2030.

**Algorand - Model likely not sustainable past 2030**

* Algorand has very high inflation. This has been discussed [time](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vu26qy/the_great_algo_mass_inflation_event_of_2021_the/) and [time](https://forum.algorand.org/t/serious-lack-of-transparency-and-engagement-of-algorand-foundation/2385/10) again while everyone assumes the 10B maximum supply is immutable LAW. The rewards are pre-minted, but there is vesting schedule for those rewards that increases the circulating supply by 49% in 2021, 20% in 2022, 23% in 2023, before tapering off at 9.4% in 2024 and beyond.
* There are multiple rewards pools for relay nodes, validators (prior to 2022), and governance. These pools eventually run out by 2030. Plans for long-term economic sustainability [were redesigned to last until 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics). There is no plan for sustainable relay node rewards or governance rewards past then. Validation nodes, which have much lower hardware requirements, are already running on altruism. What's really scary is that nearly all of token issuance is going to relay nodes and will abruptly run out in 2030 at which point they no longer have any economic incentive to stay with Algorand. Participation rewards will also run out then. The only pool left will be the tiny fee sink.
* Transactions fees currently do not pay validators and nodes. They go into a fee sink, but it's currently very tiny and only produces [$140k of annual revenue](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/algorand). This is about **100-200x smaller than annual issuance**. Thus they are not anywhere close to being able to offset token issuance.
* Another way of looking at this is that there needs to be [3000 TPS of real activity by 2030](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/vvxb9e/what_tps_does_algorand_need_to_be_sustainable_by/), 200x higher than its current 15 TPS average.

**Fantom - Model likely not sustainable past 2024**

- Fantom's low transaction fees are subsidized. The total annualized revenue from transaction fees is about [$2.7m](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/fantom), which is 30x smaller than the amount currently being paid for block rewards.
- Fantom's supply is expected in inflate by 9% in 2022 and 8% in 2023. Supply inflation is currently scheduled to [end in 2024](https://messari.io/asset/fantom/profile/supply-schedule), though it might last until 2025 with high token burns. This inflation might need to be extended indefinitely to pay for validators once the 1.0B token rewards pool runs out. The max supply will likely not hold.
- Until it upgrades to FVM, it's already at its limit and cannot grow its TPS, but it can afford to increase fees by 10x and still be very cheap.
- It has very few validators, so it can't afford to reduce rewards and risk losing more.

**Bitcoin**

- I'm not going to discuss Bitcoin because the game theory behind post-subsidy miner incentives is extremely complex.
- Instead, see these articles:  [here](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3111/will-bitcoin-suffer-from-a-mining-tragedy-of-the-commons-when-mining-fees-drop-t), [here](https://cryptofundamental.com/21-done-will-bitcoin-survive-the-tragedy-of-the-commons-271a6cd21b04), [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons), and [here](https://unchainedpodcast.com/can-bitcoin-be-secured-only-by-transaction-fees-two-researchers-sound-off/)
- We will likely have to wait until 2050 to 2070 to get a better idea.

---------

##There is a general fix for this problem

**Solution**: Remove the fixed max supply and replace it with a system of steady issuance and variable token burns to keep **total supply** near the original max supply. The hard part is increasing transaction fees enough to offset issuance.

1. Introduce steady new issuance (no more fixed max supply) to reduce reward volatility
2. Increase total transaction fees (and token burns) to offset issuance. You can increase this through a mix of higher fees and higher activity (real TPS).
3. Reduce rewards and hope that not too many miners/validators quit.

This is similar to what Ethereum does, but it's hard to copy. Ethereum is only able to achieve this with very high fees, very high sustained demand, and by reducing rewards by 80% when switching from PoW to PoS.

Step 1 to remove the fixed max supply is necessary to keep the network stable. Steps 2 and 3 by themselves are not enough because rewards will be volatile. Rewards during bear cycles will collapse, and miners/validators/participants will leave. This causes rewards and security to collapse even more, leading to a feedback loop of declining activity.

**Difficulty of achieving 100x growth in fees**: One might think it's easy to achieve 100x growth in total transaction fees by increasing the gas cost by 10x and real TPS activity by 10x. The problem with this assumption is that many low-fee networks are popular due to their low fees. **Increasing fees by 10x would scare customers away and reduce overall revenue.** Back when Avalanche's C-Chain and Polygon PoS were congested, their smart contract fees were above $1 USD. People are going to keep away from those networks if their fees are increased to over $10. **The safer method is to increase real TPS, but many of these networks would get congested at 20-100x their current real TPS.**

Lastly, many members of these crypto communities are very proud of their network's fixed maximum supply and have invested under the assumption that they will not change. **A change to maximum supply will always be extremely controversial.** If it fails to hold, there could be a collapse of faith in that token.",cryptocurrency,1658678684

so some very important information, my Grandmother gave up driving in 2016 and gave me her 2014 Honda accord, than my parents covered the taxes and took care of my insurance (all I knew about my insurance was that it was $160 a month and full coverage) welp my stupid ass wasn't paying attention and rear ended a fedex truck and totaled my car.  The company Geico gave me 13k for the car and my parents wouldn't let me argue the price with insurance and accepted the check right away (like dead ass the report said my tires were at 40% tire life when they just got replaced 20k miles ago but sure ok)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways so for a 2014 Honda accord EX with roughly 85k miles current price is 22k so im unable to get something thats like what I had prior, my dad wants me to buy a vehicle newer than 2013 with under 75k miles (if its not than my parents won't give me the money from insurance to use on a new car... great parents man fucking love them)  unfortunately I can't find any vehicle for 13k that meets my fathers requirements, he's been trying to convince me to take out a loan or finance a new car... the best option I have that would meet his requirement is to lease a new accord base model at $250 a month with $300 insurance (btw I make $2100 a month) I feel that Ill be better off saving my money and buying a 100k 2000 honda accord (about 5k) (FYI I have no money saved I dug myself into debt when I tuned 18 and now at 20 im working to pay it off quick and than start a savings) does anyone have suggestions on what vehicle I can go with that meets his guideline for a winter/daily driver

personalfinance,Car payment: Pay off now or later,"Hello everyone,

I was hoping I could get someone's opinion on this situation regarding paying off a car payment early.

&amp;#x200B;

* Loan Details:

1. Loan Started: 5/16/2022
2. Amount remaining: $13,000
3. Monthly Payment: $218
4. APR: 5.61% @ 7 Years
5. Cost to payoff early: $150
6. Total interest payments over 7 years if I do not pay it off early: $2450

\*\* We took the loan @ 7 years with the intent of getting as low of a payment as possible with absolutely full intentions of paying it off early. We did this because we were fresh college graduates and were unsure of what our living expenses were going to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Personal Information:

1. Age: 23 - I have a salaried job and wife is in grad school (Paid on stipend) 
2. No other debt 
3. Current Savings: $20,000 in saving account + $4000 in stock market
4. Household Income / month post tax: $6,500
5. Average household expenses including 401k contributions &amp; car payment: $5,500
   1. $1,500 of this is for a housing down-payment fund as we are currently renting

&amp;#x200B;

All of this leaves me with a few questions:

1. Will not having this debt negatively impact my credit score? I do have a credit card and I treat it as a debit card by paying it off fully every month on time.
2. We were not sure if a $7,000 emergency fund was enough in savings, but with the money in the market this gives us about $11,000 if we absolutely needed it - This does put us at 2 months worth of expenses covered if absolutely needed. 
3. We are thinking about buying a house in 4-5 years, I was thinking this $13,000 could be better spent in the market but at a 5.61% interest rate I don't think there is much room to beat the interest payments.

personalfinance,Budgeting and Retirement,"Hey all, I am 23 and I just started my first real job after graduating college earlier this year. I was hoping I could get some feedback / not-financial-advice on my financial strategy.

A little bit about my job and current savings:

My salary is 80k plus a performance bonus. I expect to get paid around 4.8k a month after taxes and medical insurance. My employer contributes 3% of my pre-tax salary into a traditional 401k no matter how much I contribute after one year of employment. I was fortunate enough to have a paid internship every year of college and held a part time job while school was in session. Because of this I have developed an emergency fund of 20k. 

A little bit about my debt:

During school I took on 22k of debt in the form of three loans. The first two loans are student loans totaling 9k. These loans are federally subsidized with 10 year terms. The interest rates on these loans are 3% and 4%. The monthly payments on these student loans are around 100 bucks. I also have a car loan with 13k of principle left. The interest rate on the car loan is 7.5% and there are 41 remaining payments. The monthly payment on this loan is around 375 bucks. I have no credit card or any other types of debt.

A little bit about my living situation:

I expect my essential living expenses (including rent, utilities, food, loan payments, consumables, and insurance premiums) to be around 2.5k a month. Additionally I plan to budget 1k a month for non-essentials (things like travel, social events, entertainment, etc.). 

A little bit about my strategy:

After expenses I will have approximately 1.3k to save however I see fit. Currently my plan is to contribute 1k a month to a Roth 401k offered through my employer. I plan on using the extra $300 as additional payments to my car loan.

Question 1: 

Would it be a better idea to hold off on contributing to my 401k so I can pay off my high interest car loan faster? I feel this could be a viable strategy since my employer has no matching requirements. If I were to entertain this,  I could have my car paid off in less than a year. Then I could contribute the full 1.3k a month plus the additional 375 bucks that was used for my car payment to my 401k starting at age 24 rather than contributing just 1k a month starting now for a couple of years until my car is paid off. Basically my question is the following: is it better to contribute 1k a month to my 401k starting now or to contribute 1.6k a month to my 401k starting in 12 months. If the former is more optimal, would it be better to contribute the full 1.3k I have left over after expenses to a 401k and just pay my monthly car payment?

Question 2: 

Is my emergency savings too low/high? For context I definitely feel stable at my job but I do tend to worry about things so I tend to lean on the side of caution.

Also feel free to chime in your thoughts and other concerns you would potentially have if you were me. Thanks so much!",finance,1658690159

Current debt:

Car - currently pay $399/mo. Unsure of interest rate, would have to check with my husband. We have approx $8k left on the loan.

Mortgage- currently pay approx $4,700/mo, the amount includes our property taxes. 2.8% interest rate. Approx $775k left on the loan 

My husbands private students loans (undergrad, law school, and cost of living loans): $174,000. Interest rate is 5%. We pay $1,435/mo. He refinanced in 2017 for a 20 year term.

2. Keep investing cash and use a private student loan to pay for grad school

Electricity,1800s Power to UK Mansion House,"I am trying to find images or drawings of how mansion houses were powered in the 1800s and early 1900s (pre 1920) and hoping someone can source it for me, as despite me searching cannot find anything, maybe I am using wrong keywords but maybe someone else can have luck.  


Basically the place I am trying to research has a mansion house in rural scotland and half a mile away from that was a building called ""Battery Shed"" and ""Engine Shed"", the engine shed had some sort of engine/fly wheel/dynamo on a large concrete block and next door was a place that has the battery cells and accumulator.  


It is presumed the engine powered the battery cells and the power from them was fed to the mansion house to supply the 110v power supply.  


As to what kind of generator/engine was used that is the big unknown question, but I did see that Cragside has a very similar looking Power House building and the generator/cells could be similar. But unlike cragside the mansion house i am investigating does not have a hydropower setup  


There was however a private water supply fed to the house from a large circular water tank on side of hill (another half mile away from that engine building) so there is a possibility that may have been used to power the generator/engine but as to how that could have been done is unknown. (the location of mansion house was not near a river or running water, so conventional power wheel would not be used)

 it is a large round tank, 7 Meters in height, 6 meters water height, 14 meters in diameter   
going by the size of the tank it would seem a bit excessive for just water to the mansion house, thats why i am thinking it may have had something to do with the generator, but how that would have been done is a mystery that I am trying to find out.

If it was not water how could this engine/generator have been powered, obviously coal is an option but nothing suggests that may have been used, and the same with has nothing suggests a facility or gasometer on site.  


Water was fed into the tank from nearby hills and water fed to mansion house and associated buildings by quite large cast iron pipes so certainly the tank was used more than just for mansion house toilet and sink supply.

So taking everything into account the round water tank seems to be the key object of use.

So has anyone seen anything like this setup in images/drawings/plans? either engine/generator and/or batteries?  


This is layout plan of the building in question 

[https://imgur.com/AWCbp99](https://imgur.com/AWCbp99)

Power may not have been got from the power grid until early 1940s so taking that into account then batteries/generator may have powered house but its the how would generator have been powered that is baffling me.

  
To have a power house and battery cells obviously was important. I just cannot figure out how it was powered and this is why I need some other input from others as they may know something i would not know.",energy,1658725410

I'd appreciate any tips, advice, or guidance on how I should invest this money; savings accounts offer very poor interest rates at the moment and I'm not sure buying a house is the best thing to do in the current market given that it looks likely to crash/dip (in the UK) soon. 

Stocks and shares are always a gamble; I'd prefer to go with a managed service which invests for me, as I simply don't have the time to do my financial due diligence on companies before investing. However, if the economy is due for a crash, the stock market may be a casualty. 

I tried getting in touch with a wealth manager but they just took up 3 free sessions rambling on about nothing in particular and they were not helpful in the slightest, so I cut them out.

I'm just not sure where I can put my money right now as it doesn't seem like there are any good options.

CryptoCurrency,Discussion on some of the biggest technical challenges that still haven't been solved in DEFI?,"I'll start with a couple that I can think of. I'd love if any of you have info on projects that are trying to fix this.

# Defi Credit Score

A credit score in TradFi is essentially a way of ranking your probability of repaying debt that you are issued. In the world of lending/borrowing, this allows for the market to decide what interest rate it is willing to lend to you considering your risk profile. Without a standardized credit score, the defi space relies on collateral as a way to allow borrowing. While this type of borrowing is still useful, it is far from the utility that made credit cards so mainstream in the 1st world. 

I'm not saying that the only solution to calculate credit trustworthiness is a credit score, but something needs to be developed to fill this gap or else crypto will never go truly mainstream.

&amp;#x200B;

# Standardized Security

Ultimately, crypto is far easier to steal from someone's computer than cash is from someone vault or land. This, along with a general computer security illiteracy makes hacks and theft so commonplace. Hardware or software, or DEFI programming needs to be implemented to make security less of a burden on the user. If people don't feel secure with their funds, crypto is dead in the water.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Both of these proposals would benefit greatly from standardization and regulation. Which is why I'm generally in favor of regulation that at least lays the groundwork for this development.

&amp;#x200B;

What about you? What do you think needs to be developed still?",cryptocurrency,1658749808

# [Stock futures gain ahead of a busy week of earnings, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose on Monday morning, coming off a positive week for the major averages, as traders brace for the busiest week of corporate earnings, as well as insights into further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 173 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.5% each as well.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the major averages fell on the back of weaker-than-expected earnings from Snap that sent tech shares tumbling. Still, all three benchmarks closed the week higher, with the Dow up 2%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced about 2.6%, and the Nasdaq capped the week up 3.3%.
*****
&gt; It was the second positive week in the last three for the major averages. The S&amp;P 500 has been attempting a comeback after falling into a bear market earlier this year. The index is currently up more than 8% from its 2022 and trading near the highest levels since early June.
*****
&gt; Investors shifted into risk assets last week after absorbing some strong corporate results that had Wall Street deliberating whether the bear market has found a bottom.
*****
&gt; “Equities have managed to stage a rally MTD, and climb a wall of worry. The bounce has been led by cyclical and Growth stocks, helped by longer end yields stabilizing, which in turn eases the pressure on P/E’s,” Barclays’ Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note.
*****
&gt; “This confirms to us that the market’s focus has switched from inflation worries to growth worries, with a sense that bad news is becoming good news again,” Cau added.
*****
&gt; As of Friday, about 21% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 reported earnings. Of those, nearly 70% beat analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Investors will face a stacked week of earnings ahead that will include reports from major tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will also conclude its two-day policy meeting. Economists are widely expecting a three-quarter point hike.

personalfinance,What Order Should I Pay my Debt?,"Long story short, I have 3 credit cards with a balance and a car payment. When I was 18 I got the cards and maxed them out and continued to pay the minimum. Fast forward to 26 and I’ve been just paying the minimum without using them. I recently got a decent raise at my job and can start throwing bigger chunks at my debt. Below is the info 

Capital 1: Balance = $283.34 APR = 26.14% Minimum Payment. = $25

Apple Card: Balance = $391.96 APR = 23.49% Minimum Payment = $25

Credit Union Card: Balance = $1,883.93 APR = 17.20% Minimum Payment = $30

Car: Balance = $3,483.66 Interest Rate = 8.39% Monthly Payment = $190 

I currently spend $80 split between the three cards and $190 on my car payment. I just got a bonus of $250 and my thought is to basically pay off the Capital 1 and then go down the list from top to bottom. I could afford to throw $200-250 a month at my debt now instead of the $80. 

One last question, once I have the cards paid off, do I close them or try and keep them all active? The Capital 1 card is my oldest line of credit and from what I’ve heard I should keep that one open at least, the other two I would have no problem closing them up for good.

I make good money now, but still have approximately $95k in debt between my federal student loans and my private student loans. 

I was able to refinance my private student loans at 3.7% interest from 9-13%, and my federal loans are at a max 2% interest. 

Since then, I’ve been able to pay off $25k in two years off of my private loans. I pay about $1000 a month and still have $65k left. 

I’ve been saving my $ for a while and if I were to pay that $65k today, I would still have around $20k in my bank. However, about $10-15k of that was moving money my company gave me that was put on hold due to COVID, and I worry I may have to give this back at some point 

Maybe it’s a silly question, or maybe it’s not, because I really do struggle with money and how to use it (I’m proud of myself for saving this much honestly). Should I go ahead and pay my private loan? Or would it be best to save a little more? I worry that I’ll need that money at some point, especially if I have to give that moving money back. I’m not sure if $10k is enough for a savings (like I said… i suck with money, it might be…) but also long term, this would save me $1000/mo.

Located in the US of A.  I searched around but didn't find anything conclusive.  I found a google sheet calculator for savings rate, a few interest calculators, but nothing conclusive.

Looking for a calculator that can take inputs for income and expenses, possibly account for 401k contributions and company matches, and spit out efficient numbers for amounts to contribute to savings account (say 1.25% APY) while simultaneously maxing out loan payments (say attacking and paying down a loan with a 5% APR ), and maximizes retirement account contributions to end up with a future net worth calculated amount taking into account inflation, compounding interest, average stock market return over time, etc.

Kinda like a financial planner of sorts.

CryptoCurrency,Leaked Seed Monero Challenge Results,"This post is a follow up on the challenge/competition set out 72 hours ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w5afuh/uh_oh_i_leaked_my_seed_phrase_crack_a_weak/). First off, no, no one took the bounty. That's the bad news. The good news is that I will let the bounty run over into the next challenge, effectively doubling it.

Here is the passphrase to the wallet: **kswb**

Together with the master seed from the post, it translates to the following Monero seed:

**gyrate yahoo psychic assorted joining melting ahead yoyo gave diplomat fidget trendy nobody jargon vane after shelter zodiac morsel junk pager sample biscuit bugs shelter**

Restore Date: **20220715** (or restore height 2671400 to skip irrelevant days)

Here is an assortment of great comments from observers/participants, which tells the story as good as I possibly could:

 u/LostMyPPMs 

&gt;Ok so basically to derive the keys from a seed phrase it has to be run through some hashes and KDFs that are relatively fast to compute but to know the balance of a wallet you have to go through the whole blockchain looking for transactions from that address, digging into gigabytes of data takes much longer than those hashes.  
&gt;  
&gt;By having the address you would only have to derive the address from the seeds and find the the seed where the derived address matches the one you have.

u/surrender_the_juice

&gt; I won the last \[dogecoin\] challenge, and I have no idea how to go about this one. Good luck. 

 u/Gonbatfire

&gt;Nope, Monero's blockchain ain't open to everyone, it's opaque, the only thing you can see is whatever transactions belong to you, you can't lookup the ones from anyone else.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, for each private key, you must scan the blockchain to see the transactions that belong to you, if you don't find anything you move to the next private key, which again, can only see its own transactions, so you need to scan the blockchain again and so on..

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Privacy IS security.  
&gt;  
&gt;Doesn't mater if you got the strongest password in the world, if someone knows exactly how much YOU own, they can show up at your house, threat you or your family, and force you to give out the pass. It's called a $5 wrench attack.

 u/Chemical_Main

&gt;While to some people here this *seems* simple (after all, it’s just 500k seeds right?) it isn’t. Monero has no way of knowing the amounts stored in an address without rescanning the blockchain and processing every transaction made to check if the transaction was to a given address or from it. That is computationally expensive compared to typical bruteforcing which can take milliseconds at a time per address.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyone who has used XMR from years ago knows just how long it takes to restore a multi-year old wallet. The sync time can be literally hours for one address (if using a remote node). You can of course increase efficiency by writing custom tools to brute force it but the computational complexity does not change, you still need to check every transaction proof to know if they’re your own or not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without knowing the restore height, you’ll need to scan the entire blockchain (or make a guess roughly how long ago that seed had its first transaction) for every seed you generate. Assuming you knew the restore height and it was made fairly recently you can cut down the time needed but even then it’ll still take minimum, longer than the lifetime of an average person most likely to check those 500k possible seeds by scanning a few hundred thousand blocks for each.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I’m wrong and someone does manage to crack this then color me impressed however just based off sync times alone, I firmly doubt anyone is getting that 15$ bounty.

 u/not420guilty

&gt;Im in!  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for creating this game. I love puzzles. Im playing, and I intend to win. But dont let me discourage others from playing. If I do win I will only take half of the balance so that at least one other person can also win.  
&gt;  
&gt;EDIT: At the current rate, it will take 24 days to check all 457K combos. There is pretty much no chance I will find it in the 72 hours given. :(

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I automated it. Running on an Intel i9 it will take 24 days to test all combos. So, avg luck will take 14 days. There seems like a small chance with only 72 hours in the contest, but I already write the code so Im running it and maybe I'll get lucky.  
&gt;  
&gt;Either way, it was fun to set up, thanks for creating the puzzle! 

u/PrivateButPublic

&gt;I can test around 70k transactions per second with my very high-end CPU, on a pretty fast implementation, and I would need to check 95970000000 transactions to fully exhaust the search space for this challenge (assuming 30k txs per day), which would take me about 381 hours.  
I just checked and I get around 1300 tx/s on a DigitalOcean CPU core, the biggest machine I can get is 8 cores, which costs $0.083 per hour. This means I would need around 2563 server-hours which would cost around $213. I would also need to spin up 50 servers to make it in the remaining 52 hours, and the default limit seems to be 10.  
I would have spent that money just for fun, but it's not easily doable to get the compute without having an account already (most cloudserver providers have limits for new accounts).  
&gt;  
&gt;Edit: corrected all numbers, forgot to account for 2 outputs per tx (on avg).

 u/Mochi101-Official

&gt;Restoring a Monero wallet from block 0 takes some real time and resources. It could take an hour, depending on your hardware, to scan the blockchain from block 0 to the current blockchain height.  
&gt;  
&gt;Brute forcing this is not feasible for most.

investing,Buying State Bonds in State of Residence?,"Is it a good idea to purchase State bonds in your State of residence?

I was looking at the interest rates on 30 year bonds in my State and they are currently 4.635% and are AA rated.

This interest rate is higher than my mortgage interest rate, so I am tempted to buy these if only to pocket the difference.

These bonds also seem to be tax advantaged at both the State and Federal level.

Does anyone have experience buying State bonds?  Is it generally a good idea to buy bonds in your State of residence?  Are there any caveats I should be aware of?

Like any investment, I would probably plan to DCA and diversify across both stocks and bonds.",finance,1658761613

personalfinance,Joint mortgage - can I transfer my interest rate/mortgage over?,"My dad has recently had some health issues and cannot sustain a farm by himself anymore, and my mom has her own issues and cannot help much. They have to sell their farm and the options are pretty much either live in town and get rid of all their horses and my mom possibly be alone some day, or we all sell our current houses and move into a nice one together so my parents can keep some of their horses and they're also taken care of for the rest of their lives.

I believe the kind of joint mortgage we are looking for is called ""tendency in common"", where he will own more of the percentage of the house, and I will own a smaller percentage and when they're gone that percentage is their estate.  I currently have a 2.09% interest rate until 2026, and I would like to avoid what looks like 5.2% interest rates right now or possibly higher if possible.

Can I transfer my mortgage right over to my portion of the new house? Can I blend or keep my interest rate? (which was advertised as flexible so I could break it or move).  How would this all work exactly?",finance,1658765083

personalfinance,"19yr. 20k in Savings, Debt Free, What's Next?","I've taken some time to look over the ""[Personal Income Spending Flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png)"", however, I'm left at a bit of a loss on Steps 2, 4-6.

Here's an overview of my earnings:

Full-Time (summer only \~3 months):                                                                                                                                

* Hourly: $22.50 at 40hr/week
* Take home: $1,446.90 bi-weekly 

Part-Time (semester only \~9 months):

* Hourly: $22.50 at 28hr/week
* Take home: N/A, I have not worked part-time at my current rate

Living Expenses:

* Rent: $1,270/month - $500/month - $300/month = $470/month\*
* Gas: \~$80/month
* Utilities: 

1. Water: N/A, Raleigh, NC
2. Electric: N/A, Raleigh, NC (475 sq. ft.  studio apartment)

* Internet: $70/month
* Food &amp; Groceries: \~$368/month (based on my first grocery shopping trip + eating out, likely to go down substantially)
* Medications: $49.50/month

\*I receive $500 + $300/month from my grandmother and mother to help cover living expenses.

Other Spending:

* Shopping: ...$683/month (I go shopping with my girlfriend a lot...)
* YouTube Music: $4.99/month

Other important things to note, I own a 2014 Rav4 (paid off) with \~60k miles and I do not pay for car insurance or phone both are still under the coverage of my parents. I also receive health insurance from my parents. Likely the most major point, I have a credit score of 0 (not very sure where to start here, i.e., what credit cards to look into and how paying them off works).

I have a lot of wiggle room, in reality, my grandparents are capable and willing to pay for the totality of my living expenses. I chose to not outright accept their offer, as I would like the ability to learn budgeting and living as an adult, however, they have provided me with an incredible safety net.

With regards to the ""Personal Income Spending Flowchart"" here are my thoughts,

* Step 2: My employer offers 401k matching, however, I do not know if this will remain the case when I transition back to part-time.
* Step 4, 5: I'm a member of a credit union, and the rate for IRA (Traditional, Roth, SEP) is 0.65% and the rate for HSA is similarly 0.65%. I'm not sure what this details, or if it is even worth putting money into it at those rates. 
* Step 6: I'm currently a second-semester junior (80 credit hours) my financial aid for the entire year will cover all of my school except $1,414,26/year ($707.13/semester). I have the option to take up to  $4,500 of Federal Direct Sub. Loans, however, I believe I will just pay $707.13 out of pocket unless it would be better to take the subsidized loan.

A few more things, I am studying as a Biomedical Engineer, and I currently work for a robotics company that wishes to keep me long-term and hire me after graduation. The salary prospect is &gt;$90,000/year + bonus.

I grew up incredibly poor and have essentially spent my entire childhood and pre-adolescence terrified that I will get stuck in the cycle. Now that I'm out of it, I really am at a loss for what to do from here.

I currently have $20,760 sitting in a Money Market account at 0.30%. I'm not sure if it's worth it to begin saving for retirement now, or what other avenues I could possibly take. Any insight on this would be incredibly helpful, not to mention any other parts that I have listed concerning my monthly expenses.",finance,1658766847

CryptoCurrency,This might be the worst possible time in history to invest.,"I made a post few days ago that I didn’t trust the rally, btc is going down now, you might be thinking, should I buy the dip?🤔

If you’re investing now, here’s what you’re investing despite of:

- 5.5%+ inflation hike 
- potential 100 point interest rate hike 
- highly possible recession. 

Every smart money is removing their money because of these economic realities. Tesla sold 75% of their BTC at a LOSS. No big company will sell at a loss like that if there’s really a big chance that they might make their money back soon. Bitcoin whales are selling in big volumes. Crypto companies are liquidating almost every day. 

I’m not saying I definitely know the market is going to go down but you should invest based on risk to reward ratios. The risk now is immense and the reward might only be a 10-20% leg up if you manage to predict the bottom ( I strongly doubt you can )

I’d wait. Know whether we are in a recession or not. Let inflation settle, at least a little, before going back in. 

What do you think? And why, if you’re investing now, are you investing?",cryptocurrency,1658770671

PNC had the best interest rate for my situation (Prime + 1.01 pts).  PNC offers a unique CHELOC as they call it - you can either go with the Variable Fixed Rate or Lock in at a fixed rate with varying payback periods.  The fixed rate automatically amortizes vs the 10 year interest only payment period.  If I did the Variable rate, I could lock at a later time (for a $100 fee).  I can also unlock the Fixed rate (for same fee) at any time. 

My options at closing: 

1)Variable - 5.76% APR for 10 yr draw, 20 yr payback -OR-

2)Fixed (Best rate/payback option) - 6.29% - 22 year payback

I think I'm more curios on people's thoughts on the prime rate, esp given today's inflation and Fed's trying to tone it down with higher rates.

Last Week 

Bloomberg reports that there is a high demand for bonds with over $1 billion in bids-wanted in 4 of the 5 trading days last week. The bond market had a strong week, with yields moving lower across the board. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell five basis points, while the 30-year yield fell 12 basis points, pushing up prices on longer-dated bonds and helping to push the ratio of the 10-year yield to the 2-year yield lower. The muni curve is steepening as investors are favoring the short end of the curve. The bond market is still trying to come to grips with the potential for higher inflation as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic. While munis underperformed Treasurys this week, they still ended the week firmer. Equities ended the week down, which also contributed to the firmness in munis.
Last week, investors withdrew $698.782 million out of municipal bond mutual funds, per Refinitiv Lipper data, reversing the prior week's inflows of $206.127 million.

I was saving up money in hopes of not being absolutely crushed by grad school debt, but am wondering if it’s even worth it…I figure FAFSA will see the 10k I have saved and just reduce my award by that much. Whereas I am under the impression (perhaps incorrectly) that if i invest the money into retirement FAFSA won’t count it against me.

I figure any award I do get from FAFSA will just be loans anyways, but at least they’d be the Federal subsidized loans with reasonable interest rates?

Beware volatility this week. It was said elsewhere but major earnings from tech this week, plus FOMC. 

Price is retesting the earlier resistance and looks like it wants to bleed back below .. for now. But a solid week of earnings and FOMC coming in at 75bp as most expect could lift markets back over that resistance and the 200w MA, and set us up for a continuation to the upside.

UniSwap,Crypto Prices Drop Ahead of Federal Reserve Meeting,"The Federal Reserve sees rate hikes as its main weapon for curbing rising inflation. The interest rate, the rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans, will rise to a target range of 2.25% to 2.50%. This means that pandemic-era support for the US economy is coming to an end. When interest rates go up, it affects the entire economy. For example, adjustable-rate mortgages, equity, credit cards, student loans and savings deposits and other loans are all becoming more expensive. The idea is that less accessible borrowing will reduce consumer demand, causing inflation to fall. Interestingly, however, US inflation has accelerated since the Fed started raising interest rates in March. Prices for gas, food and rent have risen, pushing inflation to a new high of 9.1%. Interest rate hikes can also affect equities, cryptocurrencies and other risky investments. Interest rate hikes can lead to a decline in capital inflows and, ultimately, a decline in economic growth. The expected rate hike in the US follows a similar move by the European Central Bank last Thursday. The bank raises interest rates in the eurozone by 0.5%.

personalfinance,Help with which debt to pay off first?,"So, I think I know what is the “best” route to take, but I would just like some confirmation/advice from others before I move forward. Here is my situation:

I recently got an inheritance from my father passing away, just over $14k.

I have $7.7k left in student loan debt, and a total of about $7.5k in credit card debt across 3 cards. One credit card account is 8 years old, the other two are 2-3ish years old. No car payment or other debt. 

I want to retain about $2k in my checking account from the inheritance to use to travel to visit elderly family members in the next few months, but I’m open to advice about whether I should just pay down more debt with that money instead. I’m at a point in my life (finally) where I’m able to save about $300-$400 per month after all expenses are paid, and it would be a little more after paying off debt and not having that expense. 

So, I was thinking that I should pay off 100% of my credit cards, and the rest, minus the $2k I want to hang onto, would go to student loans since the interest rate is lower on those. Do you all think that sounds like the best plan of action? Also, do you think it would be smart to close one of my credit accounts, because I haven’t had the best self control keeping it under check, although I am getting much better and have barely used them at all in the past six months. Or should I keep all three credit accounts open and continue to do my best to not use them unless absolutely necessary/for automatic bills that I need to pay every month anyway (phone bill, internet, etc).

Alright, now for the actual meat and potatoes of this post.

As  you can see I was an idiot when I was 18 and took out way too much in  student loans. My Dad cosigned the loans which is why this was possible.  He's a smart guy but I was the oldest kid in the family so I don't  really think he knew what he was getting himself into either. I've also  just learned he might have an overall different perspective on debt than  me.

Right out of school I was  only making $45k and paying these loans was a real struggle to the point  where I was basically only paying interest. I got a couple raises but  then got laid off about 2.5 years out of school. I've only been able to  make real progress on these the past \~2 years which is why the principal  is still pretty high.

After  getting back on track with some stable income about 2 years ago, I  refinanced and consolidated my loans and got them down to a decent APR  but unfortunately extended one out pretty far which may have been a  mistake. I've made a lot of mistakes these past 9 years but I feel at  least somewhat financially responsible and am trying to fix this for  good and get serious about paying this off.

Here is a general outline of my plan which I am hoping to get some feedback on:

1. **Reduce discretionary spending**  \- This is pretty obvious but I know I need to tighten the belt on my  spending. I haven't been living like someone with $113k in debt and I  need to start.
2. **Increase income**  \- I've been in my current position for about 18 months and my boss has  mentioned I am in a good position for a promotion (we have a promotion  cycle in October). This would come with an increase in income. If this  does not happen I will also look at new opportunities at other companies  in my field where I could get a promotion and/or raise.
3. **Apply ""Avalanche"" method at these loans** \- Cheapest way to pay these off. Although ""Snowball"" method may also work since the interest rates are so close.
4. **Direct additional income to from future raises to these loan, while maintaining current lifestyle**  \- I know I cant afford lifestyle creep and these loans cannot sit with  mostly minimum payments. I'm not saying I'm going to get a raise right  now, but there is room for career and income progression in my field  over the rest of my career. I will keep the same budget and additional  income will mostly go to loans.
5. **Annual bonus goes to loans** \- Did this with my 10% bonus this past year, and plan to do so moving forward.
6. **Annually check refinance opportunities to reduce interest rate without extending pay off date** \- Trying to pay as little in interest as possible.

Does  this sound like a reasonable plan? Is there anything else I should be  doing? Or any strategy I should change? Should I be directing more money  elsewhere?

Any critiques or advice is very much appreciated.

Thanks  in advance. I know I've made some mistakes but I'm just trying to  un-fuck myself since I'd love to own a home, get married, maybe have a  kid, and retire someday and every time I think about the sum of my debt  these things seem out of reach.",finance,1658793998
gaming,Weird issue while playing certain games.,"Hey there!

I'm having this weird problem where my whole PC freezes when I play certain games. Basically, the input gets ""disabled"" or something.

I can't move the mouse, can't use the keyboard, Alt+F4 doesn't do anything, Ctrl+Alt+Del doesn't do anything, and neither does the Windows key. My character is looking and walking in a fixed direction (usually forward) but it happened to me when I strafed too. The audio still works, the game is responsive and runs in a smooth 60FPS.

I experienced this in the following games: Apex Legends and Sea of Thieves. It didn't occur once in WoW, Warzone, Minecraft, and other games.

personalfinance,credit debt or stocks?,"Hey all, I've been in a bit of financing turmoil and living paycheck to paycheck. However, I do have stocks that were given to me when I was growing up as gifts that I try to avoid as emergency money or maybe to purchase a house when I'm able to. However, during my recent troubles I've managed to accumulate a bit of credit card debt. All in all, about 5k, not a ton but I'm only 20 so my interest rates aren't the best either. I was considering taking a large chunk of this out of my stocks in order to pay this off, but I wasn't sure if it was worth it or not. Any advice is appreciated, thank you!",finance,1658794480

personalfinance,Upcoming interest rate rise: get a mortgage or utilize retirement fund?,"I know the title may sound a bit crazy, but I just want an outside perspective. My husband and I’s apartment lease runs out in December. We want to purchase a home at that time. We are concerned about whether rising interest rates would make that a bad idea. 

Beyond having enough money for a down payment, we also have enough in retirement savings (in a self-managed Vanguard fund, not connected to employer) to cover the entire cost of the home. We’re 29, so could readily recoup that amount if we didn’t have a mortgage payment. Is it crazy to consider nearly exhausting retirement funds for that purpose? My husband and I aren’t arguing about this—we just aren’t sure what’s best here.

Thanks for any advice!",finance,1658796339
economy,"Dealing with inflation, really: corporate profiteering, monopolies and financial speculation.","In the United States, for example, the Economic Policy Institute has shown that increasing corporate profits have contributed disproportionately to inflation.   From the second quarter of 2020 to the last quarter of 2021, corporate profits were responsible for 54 per cent of overall inflation—a dramatic increase from the 11 per cent they accounted for in the previous four decades (1979-2019).

By contrast, unit labour costs were responsible for less than 8 per cent of the inflation,  compared with 62 per cent in the previous four decades.  

               Indeed, because of the recent price rises, the real value of the federal minimum wage is now at its lowest point in 66 years! 


The contribution of non-labour input costs—the famous ‘supply-chain issues’ so widely advertised—was 38 per cent, compared with 27 per cent in the earlier period.

But a much bigger role was played by growing concentration and monopoly power in industry.    Massively increased corporate profits were most evident in energy,  food and  pharmaceuticals,   as the supply shortages resulting from the war in Ukraine became convenient excuses for disproportionate price increases.

If recent global price increases. -which then translate into inflation of varying extent in different countries—  are driven by such factors,  then the policy response should be very different from the blunt instrument of aggregate monetary policy.   
It should instead focus on regulatory action to curb monopoly power and financial speculation.   Taxation of excess profits could be a deterrent to such behaviour in future, but specific actions to control prices of strategic commodities also have a role.     Those who have pilloried such policies appear to be unaware of both history and wider experience.

personalfinance,charles schwab options to work with,"Hello, I need some advice. I have a large sum of money in a suspended account.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had communicated to Charles Schwab ever since it occurred and what triggered was 1 transaction (Only 2 transactions occurred). Long story short, I recently found out that the reason why my account is suspended is because there is a fraud alert on my account.

&amp;#x200B;

The Transaction occurred Before March 16th,2022. They Locked the Account on March 17th, 2022. It has been under ""Investigation"" ever since. I have spoken with many people at Charles Schwab. At one point, I had a Manager on the phone Name was Mike from Phoenix, Arizona and he was in the field that need's to investigate my account... Anyways, he told me that the hiccup was my identity as they only had to verify my identity... We went thru several verification questions and passed all of them. He said, within 1 week, everything would be good to go. That was in April.

&amp;#x200B;

I called this last Saturday, and they haven't had an update to my case in 3 months... In 3 MONTHS! why, does 1 transaction when there are only 2 total transaction in my account, cause this to be nearly 6 months long suspension? I have done extensive research on nearly every site I come across says that the average wait time for an investigation to be completed for fraud is 10 days to 45 days with an complicated case.... It has been way past this timeframe!!!

&amp;#x200B;

What are some resources or things I can do to either speed this up or are they breaking any laws for taking this long to investigate??? They have caused me a lot and lot of stress over this and is this something I can sue them over for as they have made me so stressed out I had to call in on some days over this? Are there any State or Federal laws they are breaking for taking this long?",finance,1658806832

economy,Of course we have inflation… and its going to take a while to fix… here’s why,"Everyone is realing by  current worldwide high inflation. It is a consequential outcome of events - and our Governments increasing interest rates won’t solve our problems ( at least not quickly) and I’ll explain in simple terms why.   
Firstly I’m going to ignore regional distractions like… the war in Ukraine…. And the Syrian crisis... and all the South Americans wanting to head north…

Now why are we where we are?? Heres the sequence and reason…

2019 - we are all working and producing “stuff”. And traveling and spending. Everything is great. (I’m putting global warming aside here - that’s a separate topic, for now)

2020 - Covid hits and 50% of us stop working and STOP PRODUCING STUFF. And we stop traveling. (Yes, 50% is just for illustration) So then what…

2020 &amp; 2021 - but we don’t stop spending, because our governments print cash and pay the non-working 50% for not producing stuff. (I’m not judging whether free cash is good or bad, just stating facts)  So we continue spending on a diminishing amount of stuff and actually want more stuff because we can’t travel and want to satisfy our boredom.   
So here’s rule you all know… More demand with less stuff = increasing prices I.e. inflation.

2022 - we still aren’t traveling and we still haven’t caught up producing and supplying stuff. So demand is still up (but truthfully not much more than 2019 and pre-Covid) so prices continue to rise. and so Governments use the only tool they think they have…increase interest rates to “cool demand” and so they are soaking up your cash through interest rates to slow demand and to slow you buying stuff. 

But here’s the rub… WE DONT HAVE A DEMAND PROBLEM - WE HAVE A SUPPLY PROBLEM.  You can’t cure a supply problem with interest rates, any more than you cure a cold with a bandaid. Our issues arent like baby boomers in 1980 when greed for stuff was greater than supply! Demand hasn’t increased - Supply has decreased. Our governments should be stimulating supply not cramping normal AND NECESSARY demand - by taking away your cash thru interest rate increases. The solution that worked in 1980 doesnt apply in 2022 - because the problem is different!

And so the future… I’m sorry to say it’s going to take a while. Your Government isn’t helping with interest rate Increases - in fact they are hurting. To solve our supply problem, we need to balance productivity - supply (ie making stuff) with demand (ie buying stuff) - but sadly higher interest rates will slow that process this time around. it will take a few years. But here’s a “for sure”… when we the working folks dig ourselves out of the hole our Governments have dug deeper, the Government of the day will claim victory and claim credit for solving the problem. 

But hasn’t it always been that way???",finance,1658813320

personalfinance,Can I qualify for a mortgage while still in college and limited work history?,"Background:  
Hello, I am 21, I currently go to school studying Electrical Engineering, and I have wanted to get into real estate and rent a property. I am in my senior year and currently in a paid internship that is in the field of Electrical Engineering.   


The question you may ask... How will you be able to afford such a thing?   
Answer: I currently live with my parents, and pay a few bills. No debt at all. Credit Score: 765 with 4 cards open and maintaining them, paying full statement each month. This has allowed me to rack up a bit of money while working and from my internship a bit. I currently have about 50-70k and I really wanted to get into real estate because I want a wealthy future for my generation.   


Plan:  
Currently living in California, but thinking of owning a home in Arizona (not far from Cali \~5-hour drive in case any maintenance and I don't mind) and renting it.    
For example, I saw a house for 190k 4bed 2bath.   


Questions:  
I have heard I need at least 2 years of work history. None of my work history is really related to my degree besides my internship right now. Can I still get a mortgage or am I automatically disqualified? Now let's say I am disqualified, can my brother co-sign for me if he has 2-year work history?   


What else is required of me to obtain a mortgage? and do you think I will be able to get one? I recently joined the Navy Federal Bank union and have heard they give great rates.   


I Apologize for such a long post. Just a hustler tryna start early. I have thought about investing in the stock market, but I have only focused on putting into my Roth IRA a bit and the rest was going to go into Stocks growth but I decided Real Estate is a much better option in my opinion.

I also have some more money to dump in this hole I call a portfolio, which leads to the question on ""when exactly?"" do I press the Buy! button?  
For once, I tried to be smart about it.  
   
I've spent 4 days analysing the War, how active it is and watching/reading russian/ukranian news/blogs.  
I went on to analyse the USA financial situation - inflation, interest rates, FED and all. I even continued with the NASDAQ and SP500 charts with probable outcomes, which lead to Crypto charts and a dozen more probable outcomes. To save you the trouble - it's either up, down or sideways. Resistance and support is just BS.  
I have it all as a genogram map on a couple of A4 sheets of paper.  
Now let's look at recent history.   
The last FED meeting shot up the interest rates with 75, highest since 1994. We all expected a big dump, instead we got a rally. A lot of money changed hands but the price barely moved. Go figure.

After all of this big brain stuff I came to the realization that no matter what you do, you have no way of knowing how many people are out there waiting for the perfect time to sell or to buy, which is what moves the price up or down.   
Yesterday I saw the price fall down from 22.1k to 21k, said ""F it!"" out loud and dumped it all.

I’m planning on buying out the car at the end of my lease so the 48 month lease would be better and cheaper. I currently make $4.50/h above minimum wage and have 2 years left on my bachelor of business administration. My job is very easy and requires no labor. I sometimes just study and do homework my entire shift. 

I’m looking for guidance and advice from people who are knowledgeable and people who have gotten themselves into a good or bad lease or loan. Or anyone who’s currently in a lease or loan. Do you or did you regret it? What did you do to ensure that you can actually afford the full payments until the lease ends? How do I avoid making the same mistakes you or someone you know made? What should I do to make sure I don’t end up with a car and car payments I can’t afford anymore? Anything to keep in mind and watch out for? Should I wait at least another 12 months to see if and how severe the recession is?

I don’t need you to tell me that it’s smarter for me to take the bus or get a 2005 Corolla because I already know. Young people like me are dumb. Capitalism makes us materialistic. I really want the car but if everyone is telling me that it's a very bad idea and there's a high chance of being heavily in debt, I'll just take the bus.

Extra info:

Some people might wonder why I wouldn’t just finance the car since I plan on keeping it. I could be wrong but I don’t want to finance because I think the interest rate will be high for me. I’m young and don’t have as much credit history so I’ll probably get a ridiculous rate. I know three friends who are older than me and one pays 7% the other pays 9% and the other pays 12%. They are all financing.

*****
&gt; A late Monday announcement from Walmart, which cut its quarterly and full-year profit estimates because of rising food inflation, alarmed investors who deliberated the implications for other retail stocks. The big-box retailer said higher prices are spurring consumers to pull back on general merchandise spending, particularly in apparel.
*****
&gt; Walmart plunged 9% in early morning trading and dragged other retailers with it. Target dropped 5.2%, and Amazon fell 3.7%. Kohl’s and Dollar General lost 4.5% and 3.6%, respectively, while Costco shed 3.1%.
*****
&gt; “Clearly, they have the wrong stuff, and they have to sell it more aggressively to clear that out, which looks like it’s going to take a pretty dramatic hit as a result of that,” Jeremy Bryan, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, said during CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “The question is, how does this relate to the rest of the discretionary space?” Bryan added.
*****
&gt; General Motors fell 3.6% in premarket trading after the company missed earnings estimates, citing supply chain disruptions stemming from Russia’s war on Ukraine and global Covid lockdowns.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Coca-Cola shares rose 1.3% premarket after the topped earnings and revenue expectations, citing recovering sales volume that dropped in the pandemic and higher pricing.
*****
&gt; Shares of McDonald’s eked traded just above the flat line in early trading following mixed second-quarter results, in which net sales were hurt in part by the closure of locations in Russia and Ukraine, but international growth elsewhere fueled a rise same-store sales.
*****
&gt; General Electric, UPS and 3M also reported strong quarterly earnings Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are bracing for an onslaught of mega-cap tech earnings and economic data this week, as well as the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting, that will help Wall Street direct its expectations for the rest of the year.
*****
&gt; “I think that there’s going to be a bifurcated market,” VantageRock Capital’s Avery Sheffield said during CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “I think the bottom might be in certain stocks, but nowhere in others. So this actually could be one of the most dynamic earnings seasons we’ve seen in a long time.”
*****
&gt; Stocks traded in a narrow range during Monday’s session, with the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 90.75 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lagged, sliding 0.4%. All of the major averages are on track for their best month of the year.

&gt; **Walmart (WMT)** – Walmart slumped 9.5% in the premarket after cutting its outlook for the current quarter and full year.

Economics,Parsing disagreement about future short-term interest rates,,finance,1658839684
personalfinance,EU loan refinancing and use of unexpected inheritance,"Hi,

Two questions regarding refinancing an EU loan and potential uses for an unexpected inheritance, but first some background since my wife and I have complicated things nicely for ourselves.

My wife and I currently work in US earning well. We have a German-EUR loan @ 1.5% APR which we used to finance a property in the US, we maintain it in USD by converting to EUR to pay the German bank - so with EUR-USD going in our favor recently, our mortgage payment has come down quite a bit which has been nice lately. Our rate is locked for another 6 years and currently takes ~30% of our gross income to maintain monthly depending on the exchange rate. 


**Question 1:** 

Is it still worth refinancing now given ECB rate hike and future outlook?

Given all that is going on in Europe at the moment, outlook from ECB is that interest rates in Europe are on the rise and we may find ourselves having to refinance at a higher interest rate in the future (speculating). My gut says we should have considered refinancing '20/'21 but would it still be worth possibly refinancing now? I have yet to speak with the bank but my expectation is that our interest rate would grow as of today, however having the extra security of locking something in for the next 10 uncertain years is worth *something* I'd think but having trouble being objective about.

**Question 2:**

My wife and I have received an unexpected inheritance in EUR which we do not have an immediate need for, so we have options in how to use it, some input on my thoughts below would be very valuable :)

1) Use as down-payment for EU property, using historically strong USD savings we have to supplement a home purchase abroad in the EU. Short-term this would serve as a rental to collect EUR while we live/work in the US with one objective being to reduce EUR-USD currency risk if the exchange would go against us in the future. We've been lucky so far... Long term we would consider living in the home as a 2nd residence since our work requires frequent and long travels between NA and EU. We would likely refinance our first mortgage together with this option to make sure our monthly payments does not explode taking on a 2nd mortgage.

2) Convert to USD to and invest locally. EUR-USD pair is poor now so timing is not great but downward pressure still exists in the near term so parity could be the best rate we see in the next 5 years possibly. We could either invest locally or transfer back to EUR at a more favorable rate in the future. This option seems to me more risky but as long as we're flexible in either investing in US or in EU, then we could simply pick the better option in the near future when we've had more time to think and plan.

3) Simply park it in a EU-HYSA or similar for a few years until a clear opportunity arises or use to maintain current mortgage if EUR-USD strengthens again in the future.


Any input whatsoever or other ideas would also be very welcome. We happen to be in a position to pick between multiple *good* options which is rare.",finance,1658839745

stocks,The case for a FED pivot and a big rally,"After the worst first half of the year for the S&amp;P500 since 1970, it is not surprising that the overall bearish sentiment is at very elevated levels right now. This is something that can be seen in various data points. For example, asset manager positioning in ALL equity futures (% OI) is currently at 2.08%. To put that into some context, this was 5.07% in March 2020, 3.11% in 2016 and 2.85% at the end of 2011, making the current matric a new record low over the past decade. There are also signs of capitulation in the broad equities market, with the percentage of companies trading below cash and short term investments reaching nearly 12%. Again, for some context, this number only briefly exceeded 10% at the bottoms in 2002 and 2008. Lastly, the corporate insider buy/sell ratio is indicating that insiders are once again on the buy side. On a historical basis, they have usually been on the right side of the trade. Does this all mean the bottom is in? No it does not, but in my view we are close to one when looking at these data points, especially if we see reversal in monetary policy by the FED soon.

Now I know some of you may be wondering what this has to do with the FED pivoting, as they have shown that they are not really bothered by the broad equities market correcting in the manner that it has done. After all, what they are concerned about is getting inflation down to more sustainable levels. Allow me to put a pin in that ‘fight against inflation’ for a moment and concentrate on something that monetary policy does care about, which is the economy. Let’s start off with everyone’s favorite subject, taxes. We are seeing tax receipts come in lower on the back of these rate hikes and an economy that is slamming the proverbial brakes. This was also covered by Bloomberg recently, who noted that June’s estimated payments, which are closely tied to capital-gains realizations, were 31% lower than the same period last year. With tax receipts going down and likely continuing the slide if we don’t see a turnaround in monetary policy, budget deficits are poised to go up and US entitlement spending is poised to consume approximately 90% of these US tax receipts, which is wholly unsustainable.

Another reason why the FED is on the cusp of either breaking the economy or breaking their rate hike policy, with my view being that the latter is far more likely, is that the treasury market is slowly breaking. With debt to GDP at around 130% in the US, a major rise in yields and the breaking of the treasury market is a sure fire way to put a bullet in the financial system, something that I believe is not on the cards. They can rectify this by pausing their rate hikes, cutting inflation loose to inflate debt to GDP down towards the high double digit level, start a new QE program to halt the cracks in the economy and implement yield curve control as the final piece of the pivot puzzle.

In my view, seeing the speed at which this is unfolding, I believe that we will see a pivot by the FED and the beginning of the aforementioned monetary policy roadmap before the end of Q3. What they would need to start this however, is something to justify it. Call it an excuse or rather a justification for changing said monetary policy. This would likely have to come in the form of lower inflation numbers, as that has been the most important driver vis a vis the current rate hiking cycle. I think that this is exactly what they are poised to receive very soon, so let’s take the pin out of this subject and address it. Why do I think that after we just had the highest inflation print in some years? Because inflation metrics that are looking ahead, such as 1-year inflation swaps and port data are pointing to slowing inflation and that will give the FED the excuse it needs to get back to said renewed QE. Various commodities are also down over the past few weeks and months, with two examples being copper (down from $4.82 to $3.41) and oil (down from $113.39 to $98.43). With inflation slowing down, QE is the most likely path going forward to support the economy, even if it means cutting the inflation loose and letting it go up for the coming 12-24 months to bring down debt to GDP as I mentioned earlier. Before that happens however, we are still looking at a strong US Dollar, as well as continued volatility and downside risk across the markets between now and the decision to stop hiking, which I again think will come before the end of this quarter.

What will benefit from this taking place? Asset classes across the board, with the broad equities market resuming an upward trajectory and commodities (such as copper) and energy (such as uranium and oil) performing exceptionally well as those embark on the second leg of their respective bull markets. One asset class that I want to touch upon briefly in particular, gold and silver, is poised to outperform in a QE and YCC environment after being in a correction for nearly 2 years now. Sentiment is scraping the bottom of the barrel for this asset class and from a TA point of view they are at historical support levels. There are various ways to play this, whether it be via an index tracking the actual metal, royalty companies or the miners themselves, but that is of course all dependent upon your own portfolio goals and risk tolerance.

I hope that this post has proven to be informative and the coming months will likely be as volatile as they will be eventful. Best of luck out there for all of you and I hope you have a good and healthy rest of your day people!",finance,1658840488

Bitcoin,BTC's Macroeconomic Situation,"There are several BIG reasons behind the general bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pre-existing BTC Bear &amp; Bull cycles
2. War In Ukraine
3. Inflation &amp; Interest Rates
4. Trust in certain aspects of cryptocurrency
5. People follow others

&amp;#x200B;

**How each affect the cryptocurrency market**:

&amp;#x200B;

*1- Pre-existing BTC Bear &amp; Bull cycles*

The 4-year cycle everyone is aware about. Which involves the BTC halving every 4 years. BTC is the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. So the general market mainly follows BTC, for the most part.

This is a pattern that increases the difficulty &amp; cost of mining more BTC. Combined with the fact that the total supply is finite.

With less supply, the value goes up.

This pattern has been true until now.

And is said to continue.

So people have confidence that this will happen again.

It's a self-confirming prophecy.

(Simple Version)

**Bear Market**

People believe, in a Bear market, that the Bull market will happen again, because it has before in this cycle many times, so buying steadily increases, in anticipation of the Bull Market.

As buying increases, valuations slowly start to rise.

As valuations start to rise, the general media and general population starts to become more and more aware of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency again.

And its rising valuations.

People are FOMOing in.

Normal people are buying cryptocurrency.

**Bull Market**

Early investors see profit, and cash out.

Valuations no longer rise.

Hype slowly dies because valuations no longer exponential.

New investors start to dwindle.

Valuations start to lower.

People start to panic and sell.

The cycle repeats.

&amp;#x200B;

*2 - War In Ukraine*

War is generally bad for the economy. For the most part. There is some uncertainty, fear, from investors as a result. There are effects like governments changing monetary policies, individual people and their family/friends being affected differently, inflation which affects institutional investors such as Tesla, down to everyday traders.

&amp;#x200B;

*3 - Inflation &amp; Interest Rates*

Inflation causes volatility, and uncertainty across all ranges of investors, as I mentioned above. Normal people have less spending power, which makes their lives more difficult. Governments combat this by increasing interest rates.

However, this makes it more risky and expensive for people to take out loans. So less institutions take out loans related to investments.

&amp;#x200B;

*4 - Trust in certain aspects of cryptocurrency*

The fall of stablecoins, like TerraUSD in May, Centralised Exchanges (CEX's), Decentralised Apps (Dapps) like Voyager or Celsius, and Crypto Hedgefunds like 3AC.

Are examples of events that amplify distrust in Cryptocurrency. It puts a bad name on Cryptocurrency projects, and makes people more skeptical of getting into the space.

Events like these, steer some existing adopters of Cryptocurrency and potential adopters away.

&amp;#x200B;

*5 - People follow others*

Some of these points influence each other. And cause a knock-on effect that enhances a bearish period.

One more factor that enhances a bearish, (and bullish) period is people following others.

If people are leaving cryptocurrency, more people will likely join them. If people are joining, more people will likely join them.

This process multiplies the effects of other Macroeconomic factors on the Cryptocurrency market.",cryptocurrency,1658847417
stocks,Tech Stocks Are Moving Back in Favor. 3 That Are Trying to Break Out.,"Technology stocks have been on a tear recently. Traders looking to catch the rally should look to the stocks that have just begun breaking out. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained almost 11% from its lowest close of the year in mid-June. That beats the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 8% gain since its mid-June low. Much of what is driving tech’s gains has been related to interest rates. Markets see a higher likelihood that inflation has peaked, and that the Federal Reserve will soon slow down the pace of interest-rate increases. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has slipped since mid-June. Lower bond yields make future profits more valuable—and many fast-growing tech companies are valued on the basis that they’ll churn out a chunk of their profits many years in the future. 

**Netflix (NFLX)** is a good example. The stock is up about 31% from its June low. At $218 a share, it’s now above its 50-day moving average of $187. That signifies that market participants are now willing to buy the stock at levels above a longer-term trend. That signals increased confidence in the stock’s outlook. It’s not just lower bond yields juicing the stock. Netflix’s earnings last week revealed fewer subscriber losses than analysts had anticipated, while management said it expects subscriber growth in the current quarter. Analysts are also predicting the company will rely less on upping its spending to accrue new subscribers and grow revenue, which will allow profit margins to expand. Earnings per share are expected to compound at annual rate of about 15% for the next three years, according to FactSet. 

**Spotify (SPOT)** is another example of a tech stock that is starting to break out. It has climbed about 20% from its 2022 low hit in mid-May. At $108, it’s above its 50-day moving average of about $105. Plus, buyers have frequently stepped in this year in the low-$90 area, to bring the stock upward. John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, wrote that the stock could have easily hit a “double bottom” in the low-$90 area. Spotify’s earnings are due out Wednesday. That will be a key catalyst keeping the stock trading at healthy levels, or it could send the price tumbling again. 

**Amazon.com** **(AMZN)** stock is also looking better. It has jumped about18% from its June bottom and, at $121, it is above its 50-day moving average of $113. A “bullish breakout” is in play if the stock can continue upward, Kolovos wrote.  Earnings for the e-commerce giant are coming Thursday. This all may sound rosy, but there is plenty ahead that could complicate tech stocks’ upward trajectory. Tuesday’s trading is evidence of that: The Nasdaq slid more than 1% after Walmart’s (WMT\_ earnings warning dented broader market sentiment. In addition, many tech companies report earnings in the next few weeks, and the Fed’s next interest-rate decision on Wednesday will be key for both the bond and stock markets. Meanwhile, all three of these tech stocks are still trading below their 200-day moving averages. In order for anyone to become even more bullish on these names, surpassing those levels will be key.

personalfinance,Ex Employer is ending me a check for $171. Will I be penalized next year?,"I was sent a letter two months ago about my 401k balance at my ex-employer. 

The account balance (subject to distribution): is $171.5. This check will be sent out very soon. The letter said that if my balance is less than $1000 so that is why it isn't staying in the plan.

I didn't contribute much, and I know that. I'm just now seeing this letter.

Furthermore, I've had a lot going on in the past two months since quitting my old job and then being laid off from a new job + a breakup. No excuse, though, I should have looked at this.

 The letter said: As required by federal tax law, 20% of the taxable portion of your cash distribution will be withheld (state tax withholding may also apply).

So, will I still have to pay a tax penalty during this upcoming or next tax season? How much is the penalty?

Can I tell them to cancel and put this in my Vanguard account instead? I should have looked at this earlier. 

Never had this happened before, so any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1658850274

Of the mortgaged amount, $50k is in a HELOC which I realized now (months after closing) is an ARM. I know I messed up by not reading my closing documents carefully; now I'm just hoping to understand the scope of my mistake. Any help is appreciated.

The HELOC is marked as a `10 Yr Draw/20 Yr Repay` in the loan application. 
Numbers of note at closing time:

Type | Rate (%)
----|--------
Index Rate | 3.250
Margin added to index | 1.240
APR | 4.490
Daily Period Rate | 0.012
Minimum APR | 4.490

Current rate is now 5.99%.

From one of the addenda from the documents, they start with the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and add the margin above to get the current rate. Changes to WSJ's rate go into effect the next day. The max APR is 18% by law.

Once I realized all this (and hearing about rising interest rates), I called the HELOC servicer and asked if I could close the draw period early to lock in a rate, but the person I spoke with told me I couldn't do that. 

I was paying extra on the HELOC since it's the higher APR, but had to stop to save for some repairs that will have to be done. Eventually I'd like to get back to doing that as the my payment right now is all interest, and going up every month.

Do I have any options besides refinancing? I could *just* make the payments if they went up to 18% (not sure how likely this is, just considering the worst case) by moving money around in my budget, but I would like to avoid that if possible.

https://abc.xyz/investor/

Here is the link if you would like to send a reminder/notification for yourself.

Google, with 56% of its revenue coming from advertising, will be a true teller of how much advertiser spending has been affected by shifting consumer behavior. 

Along with Google, Microsoft will also report earnings after the bell.

I think the outcome of these earnings will act as potential indicator of how bad the upcoming recession will be, though there are already other indicators such as the CCI (consumer confidence index) showing that consumer attitudes towards buying, inflation, stock prices, and interest rates, etc. are falling pretty quickly and may go lower than March 2020 covid levels soon

 Along with this, the advanced estimate for Q2 GDP coming out on the 28th and the FOMC meeting is starting today at 2 p.m eastern time and ending late Wednesday will be major indicators of the current and future macroeconomic condition.

* Current electric rates are $0.09/kWh to $0.12/kWh recently, but most of the last 5+ years it has been fairly steady around $0.09. 

* There is no net metering here, no peak times, and solar uses a second meter with exported power credited at avoided cost. That's typically 2.5 cents/kWh, currently 7.7 cents due to high energy prices, but that is very rare. 
* No fees to be grid-tied or sell excess power

* Average monthly consumption over the last year is ~1280 kWh, likely to increase a bit this year, and more in the next 3-5 years as we have kids and air condition our upstairs more aggressively. 

* Breakeven calculation independently calculated by me using Energy Toolbase, 3.5% increasing utility rates (which seems high) and taking into account the tax credit. They pretend the battery will last forever, even though I know I'll be lucky to get 10-15 years.

* Without batteries, I'm exporting 65% of my generation to the grid

* Prices listed below are cash prices, before the federal tax credit. There are no state or local incentives.

* Everyone basically came up with the same panel placement. First filling the due south facing roof, then the (back) east facing roof. I doubt the HoA will allow me to put them on the front of the house.

Company 1 was the most expensive and mostly does commercial work. They are pretty much out of the running.

Company 2 has the most attractive offerings, was the least pushy, has the best craftsmanship warranty, the nicest panels and install teams are in house. They also are probably the smallest company and pushed me away from Powerwalls after having a customer with a problem for 2+ months with their Powerwalls, with no resolution from Tesla. The Lumin panel, a LFP battery and Sol-Ark inverter look like the nicer equipment to have. I wasn't able to find almost anything about Storz Power, the battery brand that they use. 

Company 3 is the cheapest, most pushy, largest Powerwall installer in the region, said their installers for my region are in house, and seem to have lots of happy customers. Their scale (probably at least 10x larger than Company 2) likely means they will have spare Powerwalls or components on hand if needed. They are $10k cheaper, but that gap shrinks significantly with the tax credit, giving them a 2 year faster breakeven. They offer Tesla panels as well, but recommend their own instead.

I'm struggling to pick between Company 2 and Company 3. I think Company 2 will do a better job, uses better equipment, and I liked them more. I don't like the extra $10k in price.

stocks,Activision deal with MSFT is almost guaranteed at $95/share. It's still trading around $80. Would you consider this easy money?,"Activision stock continues to trade at a steep discount to what MSFT has agreed to pay for the company, but an analyst at Moffett Nathanson thinks that could soon change.

Analyst Clay Griffin upgraded Activision (ticker: ATVI) stock to Outperform, maintaining a target of $95—the amount per share MSFT intends to pay in its $69B deal for the videogame company. But including a gain of 0.5% to $79.65 on Monday, the shares remain 19% below that level.

“Though we’d push back on the notion that Microsoft will be closing on Activision any day now, we do see strong rationale for why it ultimately should,” Griffin wrote. “With still a \[nearly 20%\] discount to the deal price, Activision shares represent an uncorrelated market opportunity that, in our view, is worth an upgrade.”

Activision stock has traded well below the deal price since the transaction was announced in January, as investors worried that [t](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-activision-merger-antitrust-51642526542?mod=article_inline)he Biden Admin might take it as an opportunity to rein in big tech. Microsoft has said it is confident the deal will close in the fiscal year ending June 2023.  

A combined Microsoft and Activision wouldn’t have a dominant stake in the $192.7 billion global games market. Microsoft has already said it plans to release Activision’s popular *Call of Duty* games on  (SONY) PlayStation consoles.

“We continue to believe that the deal *should* be approved,” Griffin wrote. “It’s difficult for us to see how the transaction could inexorably alter the competitive landscape in the video game market.”

The analyst noted that the companies disclosed in March that they received a second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission. Microsoft declined to comment when asked if it has responded to the request. An Activision representative didn’t respond to an inquiry from *Barron’s*. historically, both companies complying with such a request would set a 30-day timer for the FTC to decide whether it wanted to sue to block the deal, though recent guidance warns it can still sue to challenge deals outside of that window if it determines a deal violates the law.

Griffin suggested that the radio silence since March suggests that there is “probably some back-and-forth and a good-faith effort on Microsoft/Activision’s part to address concerns the commission has.”

“No one ever had the expectation that the FTC would give this deal a once-over and waive it in,” Griffin said. “No, we don’t think the timing of resolution is necessarily imminent. But it’s not wrong to suggest that the Microsoft-Activision deal is entering its final stage.”

personalfinance,Considering Buying a House - Financial Considerations,"Hello all. I am a 29 y.o. M recently married to my wife 28 y.o. after 8 years together. We had been living in DC up until early this year and moved to NC. We were initially hoping to buy a house sometime in 2020 after looking to move over the course of 2019, but we know how all that has gone.

We've been on the lookout for housing and seems that most of the houses that we like going up for sale are between $400-450k. This includes townhomes and single family homes both old and new construction.

Our combined gross income is about $154k with the following recurring monthly expenses and debts:

Rent $1779

Auto Loan $378 (we needed a car upon moving as Raleigh is not public transport friendly compared to DC)

Private student loan remaining balance $38k: $315 per month

PSLF Federal Student loans, income driven repayment remaining balance $130k+ : $435 per month

Credit card used primarily for necessities (grocery, internet etc) and secondary for leisure (dates, eating out etc): avg $1200-1800 per month with minimum payment $40. We have it on autopay and have no issues paying this off completely each month.

We put what is leftover into our savings account. It will vary but can range from $500-$1000.

I used a WellsFargo DTI calculator and based on what it prompted me to fill in our current monthly debts (not including things like utilities, car insurance, etc) is $2950 ballpark (assuming credit card minimum payment only) with a DTI ratio of 23%. Not sure if that is the most accurate calculator but we needed to start somewhere.

Our current financial status is as follows:

Between joint checking and savings we have $60k liquid cash. A portion of the money, $15k of it, we have was from an inheritance - not earned money so this is important for our projected savings growth. We each have personal checking accounts between $2-3k. Outside of our 401k and 403b we do not hold stocks in a brokerage account.

We have been stuck on what our best next steps are.

The homes we are most interested are in a range between $400-450k. Obviously we cannot put down a 20% payment and we haven't fully determined first owner loan qualifications in our state are. In a perfect world we'd like to get a home between $300-$350, just so happens the market has priced the homes in a range we aren't as keen on - for clarification.

We are considering the following:

\- Paying off debt with part of the cash we have to reduce amount of debt which would also help with DTI. We do have concerns that it will take longer to build our purchasing power back up due to inflation and current income.

\- Continuing to increase our purchasing power to put a larger down payment on a home, with understanding insurance will be needed without a 20% downpayment on a $400-$450k home. This would, of course, mean maintaining our current debts the same for student loans and auto loan.

\- Somewhere in between where we pay a little bit extra towards debts while keeping some for the home purchase.

personalfinance,What to do with a 401k check from old job?,"So I worked part time in retail during college, then quit and started working for my state government this year. I got a check in the mail from the old retail job cashing out my 401k balance, which was only $300 total. 

It says $64 has been withheld for federal taxes but I'm assuming there will be additional penalties if I just stick the remaining funds in my bank. However, my new retirement savings plan at work is a pension type plan and I honestly have no idea how I would deposit this check into that account (I currently don't contribute anything to it because I need the money, and might not be in this job for very long anyway). 

So my question is, is it worth the hassle to try and deposit it into the new account? How bad would the penalties be if I just cashed it instead?",finance,1658884333

personalfinance,Is my reasoning about where to keep a possible down payment sound?,"**Background**: My partner and I (late 30s/early 40s) would like to buy our first home as soon as it's feasible to do so if it is, in fact, feasible to do so. But we aren't tied to any particular timeframe, nor do we absolutely HAVE to buy one. We're just beginning the research/learn everything we can phase. We live in a HCOL area that we don't want to leave, so it's very possible that, even if the market comes down a bit, we won't be able to afford a home. The potential sticking point is the monthly mortgage payment, not the down payment.

We currently have more than enough money for a down payment in a brokerage account (invested in stock and bond ETFs). It wasn't saved specifically for that purpose, but it's available.

**My thinking is to keep it in the brokerage account rather than move it someplace else**. Here's my take on the various options:

Keeping it in the brokerage account: This seems ideal, since a) it's a crummy time to sell off investments right now and b) buying a house in the future isn't a certainty, so why diminish that money's growth potential? The risk is that if we do buy a house and need to withdraw from the brokerage for the down payment, it could be an even worse time to sell than it is now.

High-yield savings account/CDs: Doesn't seem worth it for such low interest rates, especially since we won't for sure use that money for a down payment.

First-time homebuyer savings account: We live in a state that offers a tax-advantaged first-time homebuyer savings account, but there's a hefty penalty if you don't use that account to buy a house within 10 years, and since there's definitely no guarantee we'll buy a house (and the interest rates are laughable), this doesn't seem like a viable option.

Series I bonds: This seems like the only possibly good option. In the short term, the I bonds will probably offer better returns than the brokerage, but likely not in the long term. The fact that the money has to sit for at least 12 months and there's a slight interest penalty between 12 months and 60 months is definitely a deterrent, since if we DO buy a house, it will likely be in the next 1-3 years. We could also only put in $20k per year, so at the end of 3 years we'd only have $40k of withdrawable funds (i.e. definitely not enough for a full down payment, so we'd still need to dip into the brokerage account anyway). It just seems like a bit more hassle than it's worth. (We do have our emergency fund in I bonds, which I think is a good use for them.)

Have I forgotten some other viable savings vehicle? Does my logic on these options and decision to keep it in the brokerage account seem sound?",finance,1658886220

personalfinance,Can I deduct my NJ mortgage if I relocate to CA for a job?,"Hi redditors,

Might be moving from NJ to CA for a new job, I'll be renting in CA. I currently own a home with mortgage in NJ. I will not be selling my NJ home as my parents will continue to live there rent free, and I'll still be paying the mortgage and expenses. Therefore, I don't expect it to become a rental income source at all. So, I have a few questions about tax implications related to federal and state deductions and was hoping for some insight:

1) Will I still be able to claim my NJ house mortgage interest and property tax as itemized deduction on federal return? I am unsure about the definition of primary residence since NJ home is still my only house...everywhere I look online refers to 2nd home, but I won't have a 2nd home to claim since I'll rent in CA. 

2) Will I have to file NJ state tax due to the home ownership in NJ? even though I will have no income through NJ? 

3) When I file CA state tax, can I claim the NJ home property tax deduction? 

4) Will there be any type of reciprocality? or I will have to file both NJ and CA state tax? 

Appreciate any insight. Thanks",finance,1658889096
personalfinance,I'm not sure my lender is honest.,"Yesterday I asked my mortgage lender to calculate and provide the  estimated monthly premium and also asked about the interest rate that I can get. He Quoted me and gave me 5.375% rate. There was no mentioning about points in the closing cost breakdown. Basically the given rates were without buying any points. 

Today I told him that I want to lock my rates. He was not happy about it. Anyway after so many back and forth emails he sent me the rates to lock. The other day he mentioned that their rate lock program does not require any fee.

But the rates that he gave me today was completely deferent. 

To lock the same 5.375% rate Today I have to buy points and he quoted $7838 for that

If I don't want to buy any points then the rates are 6.12%

I'm pretty sure rates didn't go that higher within just a one day. I asked him about this but he is not giving me a clear answer. Looks like he is trying cover some charges for locking the rates even though they said that their rate rock program is free. My credit score is great so Im pretty sure 6.12% rate is not correct as I see most of the lenders doing even 5.1% 5.3% today. I really thought my lender was honest but now I doubt.

personalfinance,Work from home or take a job that pays more?,"Hi,

I’m fortunate enough to have two wonderful opportunities to pick from. I was just wondering if someone with some more life advice could weigh in on which they think would be best. For background, I’m currently a government attorney for my state and I’m seven years out of law school. 

I have been offered a position with another state agency making 70,000 a year and it is 100% remote. The benefits are quite nice and all my accumulated leave over the years will transfer. As well as my retirement.

On the other hand, I have been offered a position with the federal government. I would be making about $111,000. This seems like it would have more advancement opportunities and increase my earning potential as well as be a better career path. The problem is it is about 2 1/2 hours from my house so I would have to rent an apartment and be away from my family during the week and come home on the weekends. On the plus side, I have been told that after a year I can apply to work remotely on days that I don’t have court and I can even work remotely on court days if the judge is allowing remote court. 

I have no idea what the possibility of remote work would look like here. It could be that there’s so much court that I  wouldn’t ever be able to work remotely or that the court days aren’t back to back and I couldn’t be home that much after all. But apparently the organization does allow remote work after the first year.

I’m leaning towards the federal government position just because it is something completely different, it has been incredibly hard to even get in the door for a federal position and it is a lot more money. But I’m open to any opinions! Thank you!

Also, we don’t have kids. It’s just my wife and I and two dogs. The federal
job is in a state that has income tax and the state job is in my home state that does not have state income tax. I figure after taxes and renting an apartment the fed job is about 20k more a year than the remote state job. Also, don’t worry about the strain in our relationship. We have discussed it and can handle the distance. 

TL;DR: state job that is remote paying 70k a year or a federal job that is 111k a year but is 2.5 hours from my home so I’d have to live away from my wife for a little and after the first year maybe work remote some times.",finance,1658891491

stocks,WMT and FOMC thoughts,"7.6% drop on WalMart today, off 10.04 for a gap of slightly under 10 points. Interestingly, this represents the second large down gap WMT has made since May. How long it will take to recover remains to be seen, but the point I’d like to bring up is that the bottom line of the news is that WMT is having to further discount prices because merchandise is not selling. 

If people are not shopping at their rollback mega-stores that dot the land, what does that say about American consumer confidence and the financial reserves of the typical WMT shopper? They’re apparently not shopping at AMZN, as they gapped down 5% today or Target, down 3.1%, also a gap.

Food banks across America are facing surging demands according to CNN. Is that a further indicator that the recession is already lapping at our heels? 

The CCI as reported today showed a drop in confidence of 2.7 points to 95.7. Still pretty high compared to a bit over 25% during the Great Recession, but by no means a positive economic number. Also, it’s the third consecutive drop in the CCI.

The silver lining? 

If inflationary pressures &gt; less shopping &gt; price cuts and price cuts = lower corporate profits, then the resulting reaction is deflationary pressure on the market. Oil, gas, lumber and housing prices are all dropping.

 If the Fed is less aggressive in tone tomorrow, they’ll be looking at data like this and the CCI drop today rather than signaling the next hike.

So, if the market reacts favorably to the FOMC news, then I expect WMT to have a bounce through Friday. If the market’s down, then the chart tea leaves I read suggest 117.75-ish as the next support.

During the height of last year's (and the previous year) stock market frenzy, I have begin to become very wary of markets (of course, I do time markets). **Massively unprofitable companies were shooting in value and retail seemed to be winning all the time. And imaginary coins with no value were going through the roof in value.**

All that just kept **made me referencing to Intelligent Investor** by Ben Graham.

&amp;#x200B;

Cathie Woods and ARKK fund (I knew it was a bubble moment this thing took off in public):

&gt;"" **In mid-1999, after earning a 117.3% return** in just the first five months of the year, Monument Internet Fund portfolio manager Alexander Cheung **predicted that his fund would gain 50% a year over the next three to five years** and an annual average of 35% “over the next 20 years.” ""

Result:

&gt;""If you had invested $10,000 in Vilar’s fund at the end of 1999, you would have finished 2002 with just $1,195 left—**one of the worst destructions of wealth in the history** of the mutual-fund industry. ""

&amp;#x200B;

And that tech is the future? Where's the earnings to boot?

&gt;""In 1999, portfolio manager Alberto Vilar ridiculed anyone whodared to doubt that the **Internet was a perpetual moneymakingmachine**: “If you’re out of this sector, you’re going to underperform. You’re in a horse and buggy, and I’m in a Porsche. You don’t like tenfold growth opportunities? Then go with someoneelse.”

I'm sorry. I work in tech but tech stocks are no exceptions. Companies are valued by the profits they bring in. Not by how much they are changing the world or going to revolutionize the world in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Growth stocks are worth buying when their prices are reasonable,but** when their **price/earnings ratios go much** above 25 or 30 **the oddsget ugly**:

&amp;#x200B;

What I **assume is going on going forward**:

&gt;**If** **no price seemed too high** for stocks in the 1990s, **in 2003 we’ve reached the point at which no price appears to be low** enough.

**Retail loves to buy at the high. And run at the lows.**

The words to take note:

&gt;And everyone who **buys a so-called “hot” common-stock** issue, or makes a purchase in anyway similar thereto, **is either speculating or gambling**

Very meme stock like. And all those ETFs that bubbled in. And even the big known tech firms to be quite frank that keeps getting mentioned as 'safe'. Not saying any of them are un-investable. But one should be very careful when investing known stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

And all those questionable SPACs and IPOs:

&gt;In late 1967 the **IPO market heated up again;** in 1969 an astonishing 781 new stocks were born. That **oversupply** helped **create the bear markets** of 1969 and 1973–1974. In 1974 the IPO market was so dead that only nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw only 14 stocks born.That **undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull market** of the 1980s, whenroughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the market—helping to **trigger the enthusiasm** that led to the 1987 crash. Then the **cycle swung the other way again as IPOs dried up** in 1988–1990.  That shortage contributed to the bull market of the 1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the business of creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after thebubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001

When all those SPACs were hitting the markets, those who read Intelligent Investor would have been very wary.

&gt;**Among the get-rich-quick toxins** that **poisoned** the mind of the investing public in the 1990s, one of the most lethal was the **idea** that can **build wealth by buying IPOs**.  
&gt;  
&gt;**From 1980 through 2001**, if you had bought the **average IPO** at its first public closing price and **held on for three years**, you would have **underperformed** the market by **more than 23 percentage points annually**

&amp;#x200B;

The idea that growth stocks (companies that lead the future innovation) should deliver superior results is not a supported one for much of history:

&gt;There is **no reason at all for thinking** that the average intelligentinvestor, even with much devoted effort, can **derive better results**over the years from the **purchase of growth stocks** than the investment companies specializing in this area.In the **two years** 1969 and 1970 the majority of the 126 “**growth funds” did worse** than either index.  
&gt;  
&gt;The implication here is that **no outstanding rewards** came **from** diversified investment in **growth** companies as **compared** with that in **common stocks** **generally**

&amp;#x200B;

'Blue chips' (the 'safe stocks' everyone talks about). Are they actually safe if everyone is buying?:

&gt;In fact, **at** **least subconsciously**, they calculated that any price was toohigh for them because they were heading for extinction—just as in1929 the companion theory for the “**blue chips**” was that **no pricewas too high** for them because their future possibilities were limitless. Both of these views were exaggerations and were productive of serious investment errors.**Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced only40%** from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high, Standard &amp; Poor’s indexof **low-priced stocks had shot up no less than 280% in the sameperiod.**

By going to 'safe stocks', the actual returns after a downturn were abysmal at some time periods. And in the case of Japanese market, going to the blue chips was the best way to lose money.

&amp;#x200B;

US tech is the future. There's no way it can ever not return 10% CAVG a year in S&amp;P 500.

&gt;It’s the end of 1989, and **you’re Japanese. Here are thefacts**:• Over the **past 10 years**, your stock market has gained an annual**average of 21.2%,** well ahead of the 17.5% annual gains in theUnited States.• **Japanese companies** are **buying up everything** in the UnitedStates from the Pebble Beach golf course to Rockefeller Center;meanwhile, **American firms** like Drexel Burnham Lambert, Financial Corp. of America, and Texaco are **going bankrupt**.• The **U.S. high-tech industry is dying. Japan’s is booming.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1989, in the land of the rising sun, **you can only conclude** that**investing outside of Japan is the dumbest idea** since sushi vendingmachines. **Naturally, you put all your money in Japanese stocks**.The **result?** Over the next decade, you \*\*lose roughly two-thirds ofyour money.\*\*The **lesson?** It’s not that you should never invest in foreign marketslike Japan; **it’s that the Japanese should never have kept all theirmoney at home. And neither should you**

We all know what happened afterwards. Past performance is not indicative of future performance but the notion of the past decade of US tech reigning supreme in stock market should actually be warying for US investors. For much of it is not the profits that increased, but multiples instead (tldr: just paying higher $ per dollar instead of more $).

Diversification is the only free lunch. Please keep in mind you only have 1 retirement. If you are wrong and put all your money in 1 basket, there's no going back. Sheer greed for higher returns can ruin your plans in ways that are unplanned.

&amp;#x200B;

What about buying **unpopular profitable companies?**

&gt;The concept of buying “unpopular large companies” and execution on a group basis, as described above, are both quite simple. But in considering individual companies a special factor of opposite import must sometimes to be taken into account. Companies that are **inherently speculative because of widely varying earnings tend to sell both at a relatively high price and at a relatively low multiplier** in their good years, and **conversely at low prices and high multipliers in their bad years**.In these cases the **market has sufficient skepticism** as tothe continuation of the unusually **high profits to value them conservatively, and conversely when earnings are low or nonexistent**.  
&gt;  
&gt;As it **happens Chrysler has been quite exceptional in the DJIA**list of leading companies, and hence it did not greatly affect the thelow-multiplier calculations.

**But...**

&gt;end of 1968 and revalued on June 30, 1971. **This time** the figures**proved quite disappointing**, **showing a sharp loss for the low multiplier** six or ten and a **good profit for the high-multiplier selections**. T**his one bad instance should not vitiate conclusions** based on 30-odd experiments, but its recent happening gives it a specialadverse weight. **Perhaps the aggressive investor should start withthe “low-multiplier” idea, but add other quantitative and qualitative requirements thereto in making up his portfolio.**

&amp;#x200B;

How to put price on a stock:

&gt;Graham feels that five elements are decisive.1 He summarizes them as:• the company’s “**general long-term prospects**”• the **quality** of its management• its **financial strength** and capital structure• its **dividend record**• and its current dividend rate**The long-term prospects.**

Refer to Security Analysis as you crunch up your own numbers. If you don't want to read that textbook, just standard DCA is basically what's needed using conservative assumptions and having some reasonable safety of margin (cause no one can reliably predict the future).

&amp;#x200B;

'Inflation is thing of past'. Deflation is an issue (and most likely is longer term).

&gt;In **recent years,** the true rate of **inflation** in the United States has probably runaround 1% annually—an **increase so infinitesimal** that many pundits have **proclaimed that ""inflation is dead**.” More basically still, the **intelligent investor must always be on guardagainst whatever is unexpected and underestimated**Since 1960, **69% of the world’s market-oriented countries havesuffered at least one year** in which inflation ran at an annualizedrate of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periodsdestroyed 53% of an investor’s purchasing power. **We would becrazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such adisaster**. But we would be even crazier to conclude that it cannever happen here.

Inflation in 1973-1982 in US:

&gt;In 1979 alone, inflation raged at 13.3%, **paralyzing the economy in whatbecame known as “stagflation”**—and leading many commentatorsto question whether America could compete in the global market.Goods and services priced at $100 in the beginning of1973 cost $230 by the end of 1982, shriveling the value of a dollar to less than 45 cents. No one who lived through it would scoff at such **destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to protect against the risk that it might recur.**

'Inflation is good for stocks'. Maybe in the longer run but:

&gt;Our figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from **inflation havingbenefited** our corporations and their shareholders, its **effect hasbeen quite the opposite.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The **debt** of corporations has**expanded nearly fivefold** while their profits before taxes a littlemore than doubled. With the **great rise in interest rates** during thisperiod, it is evident that the **aggregate corporate debt** is now an  
&gt;  
&gt;**adverse economic factor** of some magnitude and a real problem formany individual enterprises.

**And if stocks happen to go up because of inflation (remember 2020 March to last year?)**:

&gt;**if another bull market comes along**, he willtake the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not as achance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a **vindication of the inflation hypothesis** and **as a reason to keep on buying**common stocks **no matter how high** the market level nor how lowthe dividend return. **That way lies sorrow**  
&gt;  
&gt;that **stocks failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time**

Would commodities necessarily shield you from stock market downturns?

&gt;The **near-complete failure of gold** to **protect** against a loss in thepurchasing power of the dollar must **cast grave doubt** on the ability of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation byputting his money in “things.”

Best to not think so.

As for conclusion to whether stocks will do well:

&gt;**Common stocks may do better in the future than in the past, but they are far from certain to do so.**

There is no guarantees in investing. There is no reason why stocks must do better than bonds. And that stocks must have positive returns (especially after inflation).

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, if anything is to follow, it is to buy profitable companies when there's nightmare in the markets. Historically, you would have been rewarded very well. This also shows up in Nick Sleep's letter in which Nick Sleep invests in a Zimbabwean firm despite the hyper inflation and government instability going on there. Hence, I put a portion of money on Alibaba, a Chinese tech stock.

&gt;And then **Mr. Market went into a sudden, nightmarish depression**.On September 30, 2002, just two and a half years after hitting$231.625 per share, Inktomi’s stock closed at 25 cents—collapsingfrom a total market value of $25 billion to less than $40 million. HadInktomi’s **business dried up**? **Not at all**; over the previous 12 months,the company had generated $113 million in revenues. So what hadchanged? **Only Mr. Market’s mood**

And for [Nick Sleep's Letter](https://igyfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full_Collection_Nomad_Letters_.pdf) with his investment on Zimbabwean firm during Zimbabwe political instability:

&gt;. **Zimbabwe can be described as a fascist state**, in denial. Not only is **not encouraging**, but it is **also not sustainable.** **Destroying the agricultural sector because it is white-controlled** is stupid to the point of evil, when agriculture makes up 65% of the economy  
&gt;  
&gt;**Zeckhauser:** **One of our participants is buying Zimbabwean securities**, which are priced at a small percentage of Net Asset Value. **Would you try to invest with him?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Other panelist: No!**  
&gt;  
&gt;In the mid noughties, economic conditions were almost uniformly favourable around the world, and equity market prices reflected the prevailing conditions. In a perfect world, **Zimbabwe was a glaring anomaly**. **In Zimbabwe one could purchase** industrial assets, often monopoly or near monopoly operations, **for much less than the cost of those assets**: cement plants for ten cents on the dollar and breweries for one quarter of the cost of the stills and lorries.  
&gt;  
&gt;**We have no idea when trading will resume,** it could be quite a long haul, and so the independent directors of Nomad’s General Partner have **taken the view that our Zimbabwean holdings should be valued at zero**  
&gt;  
&gt;. Even though **Zimbabwe is far from normalised**, Nomad’s investments have **risen in price between three and eight-fold in US dollars** and, following the sale of our final Zimbabwean investments last year, the dollars have been remitted to Nomad’s bank accounts in London

I am not saying to touch Chinese stocks. Please don't. There's so much political risks and your money is your money. And fundamentals in Chinese tech firms are struggling right now due to extreme policy (business is 'drying up'); it's a big bet even if you don't believe in political risk that business can slowly come back to pre-covid. But at least for me, it seems the only reason people really hate Chinese profitable tech stocks is because the price went down. Anyways, ignore this commentary cause it can come off as a shilling.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, you might be wondering, if it were so 'obvious it was a bubble', did I get out of markets?** And the **answer** is a **resounding no.**

**Markets can stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent. I never sold** my US/International **index funds** and don't plan to. **Dot com bubble was first pointed out as a bubble in 1992**. It **wasn't until 2000 that it burst (8 years).** If you **stood in the sidelines for 8 years straight, you would never have gotten in the price of 1992.**

**Stay invested. But also don't fall for media**. Just because media tells you to buy/sell love/hate a stock/sector, doesn't mean you should. **Try to stay objective**. And if possible, **with serious retirement money, please don't speculate** and invest in broad well diversified low turnover index funds for the long run.

**Good luck to you all!**

&amp;#x200B;

Also:

&gt;**Successful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it.** At first glance, **when you realize that Graham put 25% of his fund into a single stock**, you **might think** **he was gambling rashly** with his investors’money. But then, when you **discover** that Graham had **painstakinglyestablished** that **he could liquidate** GEICO for **at least what he paid**for it, it becomes clear that **Graham was taking very little financial risk**.But he **needed enormous courage to take the psychological risk ofsuch a big bet** on so unknown a stock.And **today’s headlines are full of fearful facts** and unresolved risks:the death of the 1990s bull market, sluggish economic growth, corporate fraud, the specters of terrorism and war. **“Investors don’t like uncertainty,”** a market strategist is intoning right now on financial TV or in today’s newspaper. **But investors have never liked uncertainty**—and **yet it is the most fundamental and enduring condition of the investing**world. It always has been, and it always will be\*\*. At heart, “**uncertainty**”\*\***and “investing” are synonyms.** In the real world, no one has ever beengiven the ability to see that any particular time is the best time to buystocks. Without a saving faith in the future, no one would ever invest atall. **To be an investor, you must be a believer in a better tomorrow.**

**And note markets in short term tend to behave more like zero sum** games **even though it is a positive sum game in the long run**. So **if everyone else is investing in X, then chances are, there's going to plenty of losers in that investment**.

I would be very skeptical of stocks that have risen in value and is constantly mentioned in reddit. Even the big profitable tech firms. But that's just me. Just don't throw money blindly.",finance,1658907658
solar,"Would like a battery capable of running AC, quotes for Enphase IQ10 are marked up to $21k!! What other options are there to buy direct?","As in the title, looking for alternative power stacking batteries so that I can run AC during outages.

There seems to be some kind of racket being run on these particular batteries, I believe they retail at about $7K, but is running a premium at the moment, like most other things so I've seen it at $9,500. Whilst I'd like to get the whole system installed by the one vendor, I am willing to shop this piece out and even buy it myself directly, do the physical placement and then have the hook up and commissioning performed by the solar installer.  This way, I deal with bad cells and warranty issues on battery unit alone.  Everything else remains the installers responsibility.

CryptoCurrency,Harmony One is 99% Harmony DONE! TLDR: They're gonna dilute your tokens with new ONE minted.,"Last time, I wrote Harmony One is 95% Harmony Done. It seems I was wrong. It is 99% that One is Done now. They have made a proposal to reimburse those who were affected by the hack. Link below.

[https://talk.harmony.one/t/reimbursement-proposal-horizon-incident/20665/6](https://talk.harmony.one/t/reimbursement-proposal-horizon-incident/20665/6)

TLDR: No bail out. Loss will be reimbursed in ONE tokens. Worst yet:

1. One holders have NO saying the proposal. All you got is whether those were affected by the hack should be reimbursed 50% or 100%. You gotta bite the inflation proposal.
2. You gotta sell ONE in centralised exchanges if you would like to buy back your lost tokens like USDC or ETH.
3. ONE being reimbursed will be MINTED and not from the treasury wallet. Remember who said their treasury wallet could cover the loss. Hell no. They will PERFORM the hardfork to increase number of ONE in circulation. Your ONE will be diluted by new ONE minted in a span of 3 years.
4. Basically, Harmony team is NOT taking responsible for the hack, they are not gonna pay you a damn thing. It is future investors who are gonna buy new ONE will be paying up for the reimbursement. It is INSANE and ABSURD.

another TLDR: Those who are affected got f\*\*\*ed twice. They will reimburse you by the worthless token which will be diluted in 3 years as more ONE will be redeemed.

To ONE holders. Be prepared to see a volatility of ONE in a few month. There might be a case it will be pumped by some whales so you could be their exit liquidity.

To me (not a financial advice): One is as good as Done now.",cryptocurrency,1658908630

CryptoMarkets,The Prospects of a good investment even in the bear season.,"Since  the bear over the past couple of months, many have withdrawn  investments from the crypto space. The few more courageous ones may have  only managed to leave what was left of them in stable currencies like  USDT, USDC and BUSD. Hard times they say requires desperate measures,  this I very much understand.

Over  the course of my crypto journey, I have researched about several  opportunities that are available in the crypto space that can be  utilised in this bear period

I am  familiar with a few techniques from trading perpetuals, to getting into  newer projects as it appears people are dumping the older ones.

Decentralised  Finance(DeFi)  for passive incomes ranging from farming to staking to  airdrops seems to be another rewarding ecosystem this bear period. Some  of these DeFi platforms include Biswap, Nervos, Equilibrium and Fusotao.

Biswap  is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap tokens on  the BNB Smart Chain. Besides having a novel referral system and low  trading fees, Biswap also offers an assortment of products and services.

The  Nervos Network is an open source public blockchain ecosystem and  collection of protocols creating the foundation for a universal  internet-like public network.

Equilibrium  is a DeFi 2.0 platform on Polkadot. It has a money market and order  book DEX all in one ecosystem. The money market can be used for lending,  borrowing and earning on securing loans with pliable interest rates. On  the order book DEX, users can do margin trading with high leverage and  earn passively from the market making pools for liquidity providers.  While I liked the fair refferal rewards on Biswap and the awesome  staking rewards on nervos platforms, I must say I was much pleased by  the order book features of Equilibrium.

Fusotao  protocol is a verification protocol for orderbook-based matching system  using the paradigm of execute off-chain, verify on-chain. It is powered  by the decentralized infrastructure of Fuotao, a trust-free  orderbook-based matching systems with zero-cost gas and low latency.

As  it stands now, I just might begin to research on other similar novel  projects to add to the list above so as to put in my fair investments  for some good returns while also waiting for the the bull run.

stocks,We've reached the bottom,"We hit 3636 on the 17th. Now we are at 3964. We need to go down 8.7%. That's pretty big drop and I don't see any big news coming.  

&amp;nbsp;



Multiples have come down, the ukraine war has stagnated, I don't think china will continue with lockdowns, I don't think the dollar will keep rising and expectations have been massively lowered.

&amp;nbsp;

Russia has already massively reduced the gas to the eu. A likely bad result is Russia cutting off the gas completely but a lot of that has been priced in already imo and the eu countries are taking steps to protect themselves. I don't think we will see super widespread lockdowns in China. They are already trying to increase their vaccination rates and the cases have gone lower. But even with strict widespread  lockdowns we see companies like Tesla not get hit that hard because employees are lockdown in the plant and continue working. 

&amp;nbsp;

Dollar strength has hurt earnings some companies like google and microsoft have missed their earnings coz of that, some companies like Johnson and johnson have also seen their profits hit but have met earnings. I don't think we will see a ton more dollar strength because other central banks have started hiking along with the fed. And the market hasn't reacted very negatively to lower earnings coz of strong dollar.   
  
&amp;nbsp;

Expectations have been lowering for a few months. Micron had something like 24 earnings revisions and even though it's earnings weren't great it still went up coz it beat earnings and expectations. Same with Netflix, lost 1m subs and still went up. Recently walmart also came out and lowered expectations too. Big tech giants have announced hiring freezes and companies like coinbase and shopify are laying off ppl. Companies are scrambling to lower costs and prepare for the upcoming decline in revenue. Imo the bar for next earnings will be low and companies will do okay. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
  

Oil prices have gone down. There has been more time for supply chains to improve. The Fed will see 2 inflation reports by September. The market has priced in rate hike next year so if we get a surprise from the fed it will be most likely by next year if they decide to keep raising rates. And inflation started increasing late last year so the closer we get to years end we will be comparing now to a higher base which will mean lower inflation %  
   
&amp;nbsp;  
  
We might get an 100 basis point surprise from the Fed or apple missing earnings or some other shock and drop a bit but I don't think we will drop 9% more to reach new year lows.",finance,1658913598

Suppose you care and want a way to quickly visualize a number of economic factors which are highly specific.

I want to be able to quickly see these at a glance every day, or whenever I want, without having to search for them one by one. So I'd like something like a dashboard that gets and processes data from a multitude of sources, and can be customized to show any data.

I've been following this technology for a couple of years but only now I'm in position to acquire some BTC. 

FYI I 'm not planning to trade or even sale in the future, I truly believe in BTC and I'm going to HOLD it forever. So my big and only concern about the price move is that if it goes down I would feel like ""oh dam, now I could buy more"". It's only about that, to gather all that I can. 

If you have the possibility to acquire 2 BTC at today's price. What would you guys do? 

1) Would you buy it all at once someday maybe in the following weeks? (Expecting a price dump from the FOMC meeting).

2) Would you buy small chunks starting in a couple of weeks trying to DCA as much as possible?

3) A more speculative version of option 1. Would you wait even longer, like end of this year to wait until the world's actual situation keeps getting worse, and expect an even cheaper price? (Like war in Ukraine, Food shortage, Energy crisis, Home crisis, Inflation, etc)

&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 133 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures increased 1.4%.
*****
&gt; Alphabet shares rose nearly 4% premarket after the tech giant’s quarterly report showed strong revenue from Google’s search business. That said, the company’s overall earnings and revenue came in below expectations.
*****
&gt; Microsoft popped 3.7% even after the company’s earnings and revenue came in below analyst estimates.
*****
&gt; Enphase Energy also popped on the back of its latest results, trading 9.7% higher. Chipotle also added 8% following its mixed second-quarter earnings release.
*****
&gt; There are more major earnings reports to come. On Wednesday, Boeing and Shopify are expected to release their quarterly results before the bell. Qualcomm, Ford and Meta Platforms will report at the end of the day.

*****
&gt; “With so many moving parts to consider, we expect markets to remain volatile after the FOMC meeting,” wrote Mark Haefele of UBS Global Wealth Management. “With the markets anticipating a 3.3% fed funds rate by year-end, this means that after this week’s meeting, there may be around 100bps of rate hikes by end-December. But the pace of hikes remains uncertain.”

personalfinance,Step father passed and I am trying to help my mom.,"Hello personal finance, my step father just passed away and I am trying to help my mom get her finances in order but there a few things that I am worried about.

1. My step father was the sole proprietor of his business. The company is in massive debt and has a bunch of lawsuits against it. All loans for this were taken under his name. Worried they might come after my mom for this.
2. My step father convinced my mom to take out a loan against her car through title max. The interest rate is 159% with 8000 on the balance. We are trying to get this one paid of as fast as possible.
3. My Mom co-signed a loan with my step father for 23,000 and this was sent to collections. I have no idea how to deal with the collectors.
Right now my mom make around 3000 dollars a month.

Expenses:
Mortgage: 800
Water util: 79
Internet: 50
Phone: 50
Electricity: not sure yet
Title max: 8k
Loan in collections: 23k
Funeral expenses: 7k

We have some time on the funeral expenses as we have a zero percent apr for a given period. Family is helping as well.

She resides in Texas and at this time I don’t know if we can afford a lawyer or financial advisor.
Any help would be appreciated.",finance,1658925559
cardano,Comparison of energy consumption of Cardano and Bitcoin,"Did you know that Cardano is about 100,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin? Is this important to you? Maybe yes and maybe no. However, this topic is increasingly being debated at the level of governments and regulators. Their decisions may affect the future of blockchain projects. Let’s look at the details. 

# TLDR:

* Climate change, the economic crisis, and the negative geopolitical situation are forcing people to think about the appropriate use of energy.
* The argument that PoW must consume energy to provide security is valid only until the security budget is exhausted.
* The use of green energy for PoW mining is not a relevant argument for the ECB. Jurisdictions must meet emission limits. Green energy can be used elsewhere.
* It is difficult to see how authorities could opt to ban petrol cars over a transition period but turn a blind eye to bitcoin-type assets built on PoW technology.
* People should decide what technologies they want to use. However, they should take into account other people’s wishes.

# Intro

Protecting the environment is a priority for our planet. For many years, this topic has been overlooked as governments have focused mainly on economic development and technological progress. Ecology has been seen as an obstacle or a topic that can wait a few more years. This is changing rapidly. In Europe, and elsewhere in the world, we are reaching new temperature records. Britain has experienced 40-degree heat. It is also hot in France and some states in the US. The climate is changing faster than we expected. Thanks to negative geopolitical events, the price of energy is rising steeply, and this is at a time when Europe is committed to going green. The green deal is now in jeopardy, but legislators are trying to achieve the goals that Europe has decided to achieve.

These, and many other reasons, are leading to a growing debate on the meaningfulness of Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks. While the cryptocurrency community strongly believes that blockchain is revolutionizing the world of finance, not everyone on the planet shares this enthusiasm. We need to look at the issue dispassionately and understand the arguments of people who have not yet grasped the meaning of cryptocurrencies.

Importantly, the concept of decentralization is not only associated with Bitcoin, i.e. with the PoW consensus. Cardano is proof that Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus is a quality alternative to PoW. PoS in Cardano will celebrate its second birthday in 2022. There are many other PoS networks in the cryptocurrency space that have also been running for several years. No PoS network has yet been successfully attacked.

Should energy intensity be a barrier to decentralization, the cryptocurrency industry will survive without PoW networks. Bitcoin is a hugely important project for the entire industry and has a lot of backers behind it. On the other hand, the energy intensity of this PoW network is huge and, more importantly, hard to predict. If the value of BTC coins were to increase dramatically in a short period of time, say 100x, the energy intensity would also increase at the same time in the same proportion. If Bitcoin consumes as much energy today as, say, Spain, after such a dramatic increase in the value of BTC coins, Bitcoin would consume as much energy as 100 countries the size of Spain. Even Bitcoin fans have to admit that this is hardly sustainable for our planet.

We can also see the other extreme, i.e. that the value of BTC coins will not rise as quickly. In that case, however, the security of the Bitcoin network will decline, as the halving event gradually reduces the number of coins miners receive to cover the cost of the energy they consume. It would be unwise for the world to adopt a network whose security is inadequate. I have seen many successful attacks on PoW networks. A low hash rate was always to blame. PoW networks can’t afford for native coins to not permanently grow in value.

Peter Todd, a former Bitcoin core developer, has created a tool that [shows the security budget of Bitcoin](https://www.btcsecuritybudget.com/?fbclid=IwAR1NPFqQiiNhdNLJHlGzRUFDQrcn8Pdx01IFVrvnPLwHDgG_UtYZTJDzv5I). Anyone can play around with the parameters and see under what circumstances Bitcoin remains secure and decentralized. For example, if you leave the default settings in the tool, i.e. the average fee at $1.50, the block size at 1.20 MB, and set Bitcoin’s market capitalization at $100T in 2140 (4,7M USD per BTC), you will find that by 2024 Bitcoin’s security will be “Insecure” according to Peter.

We all know that the overall capitalization of the Bitcoin network is influenced by the big players and banks. If regulations and laws forced these institutions to refrain from investing in Bitcoin, the value of the coins would drop, which would have a dramatic impact on the security of the network. In other words, if Bitcoin is to be secure, it probably cannot do without support from the highest levels of politics.

Let’s not forget the ESG initiative, which can also influence decision-making quite significantly. It is time for the cryptocurrency community to share its views on the future with legislators. Ignorance and disinterest in talking to politicians on this topic can backfire.

The energy demand for running PoW and PoS networks is a topic that should be addressed more, not only across the cryptocurrency community but also at the level of politicians and other important bodies. Let’s take a look at the energy intensity of Cardano and Bitcoin networks in this article.

# How to calculate the power consumption of the Cardano network?

The energy consumption of the Cardano network is independent of the value of the ADA coins. This means that the power consumption is almost constant regardless of whether it is a bear market or a bull market. The number of nodes on which the pool or relay service runs must be taken into account in the calculation. Even so, the calculation may not be straightforward.

Based on Cardanians’s live relay analysis, some pools have 5 relays, others share some relays together, others run multiple pools on a single device, some have more relays under one DNS name, etc. Some run failover infrastructure and some have non-public relays. We have tried to factor in an appropriate average of all of these. Our estimation includes all nodes in the infrastructure.

If we consider 45W as the consumption of one node, we get the total consumption of the Cardano network by multiplying this constant by the number of all nodes in the infrastructure. At the time of writing, there are 4286 nodes in the network. The annual energy consumption of the Cardano network comes out to about 1.6 GWh. Current data can be found in [Cexplorer](https://cexplorer.io/energy).

# How to calculate the power consumption of the Bitcoin network?

The PoW consensus is based on electricity consumption. Unfortunately, the calculation is not so simple, as the power consumption is directly dependent on the value of BTC coins. Since the value of BTC coins is volatile over time, the electricity consumption also rises and falls. Because security is directly tied to the security budget, network security also rises and falls with the value of BTC coins.

The hash rate can rise regardless of the energy consumed as the efficiency of ASIC miners increases. This means that even if the price of BTC coins were stable for an extended period, the hash rate would increase. Miners cover the cost of buying energy through BTC rewards. Because the price of energy is different in each country, it is difficult to estimate how much energy miners will purchase.

There are several ways to reliably estimate the energy costs of mining. Let’s show some of them. It is possible to use a total hash rate and assume that miners have the latest ASIC miners. Miners always try to be as profitable as possible. On the other hand, it is not always economically viable to buy new hardware. So not all miners will have the latest models. Moreover, chips are currently a scarce commodity, so the demand for ASIC miners may not always be met in time. Anyway, if we know what hash rate one ASIC miner can produce, we can divide the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network by the hash rate of one device. This gives us the number of ASIC miners in the network. As we said, one must take into account that part of miners is older. Since we know the cost of running one ASIC device, we can also estimate the total power consumption.

The network security budget can also give us a rough idea. If we assume that mining must be profitable, we know that miners will not spend more money on energy than what the network pays through BTC coins. We have to subtract the cost of buying ASIC equipment, labor, the space in which the miners are located, costs related to cooling, fees to pools, profit, taxes, etc. We can calculate the gross cost per day of running a bitcoin network by multiplying the number of rewards per day by the number of bitcoins miners receive in block rewards (including fees), and multiplying the whole thing by the current value of BTC coins. Thus, (6 \* 24) \* (6.25 BTC + 0.1 BTC) \* 20,000 USD. That’s a total of $18,288,000.

If we wanted more accurate results, we would need to know specific data directly from the miners. Still, we can make a rough estimate. The gross annual cost of running the Bitcoin network is approximately 188,222 GWh at this point, according to our calculations. Our results are consistent with what is published, for example, by [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/881472/worldwide-bitcoin-energy-consumption/) (177 000 GWh) and [digiconomist.net](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/) (134 000 GWh). Keep in mind that these numbers are from the time the article was written, and as we wrote, they change significantly over time.

# Comparison

If we take the annual cost of running the Cardano network, 1.6 GWh and compare it to the annual cost of running the Bitcoin network, 188,222 GWh, we find that the Cardano network is about 117,000 times more environmentally friendly.

As you can see, the carbon footprint of the Cardano network is almost negligible compared to Bitcoin. PoW mining has a very negative impact on the environment and generates 74.76 Mt of CO2 per year, similar to the state of Colombia. A single Bitcoin transaction costs the world 1,491 kWh, which is roughly the cost of running a U.S. household for 51 days.

The fundamental argument in favor of PoW is that energy consumption is a prerequisite for securing the Bitcoin network. Time has tested this argument, but it is often forgotten that the rewards process is dynamic. As Peter Todd suggests, the security of Bitcoin is by no means certain and will depend on the growth in the value of the coins. Unchanged monetary policy is a groundbreaking technological advance, but long-term sustainability must not be forgotten. If it’s only supposed to work for, say, 20 years, it’s not as useful as it first seemed.

There is no convincing argument that PoS doesn’t work or that it has some fundamental weakness. Both PoW and PoS networks can be attacked. The attack vectors are different. There are several implementations of PoS and none of them have failed yet. It turns out that dependence on power consumption is not necessary. The advantage of PoS networks is that, unlike PoW, they are sustainable in the long term.

The security of PoS networks also grows with the growth in coin value, as it makes it more difficult for a single entity to accumulate large numbers of coins. On the other hand, the security of PoS networks also depends on the distribution of coins among users. If more than 50% of the coins were owned by 10M network users who would not sell them due to passive income, an attacker would essentially have no chance to get the necessary majority to attack. At the same time, it would be enough that the value of the coins would not drop dramatically, i.e., they could remain at the same level, and the security of the network would not be fundamentally altered by value drops.

Assume that all coin holders are honest participants because they have an economic incentive to protect the network. PoW networks have the disadvantage that strong competition can drive honest miners out of the game. In other words, an honest miner may not be profitable and is forced to stop mining. Thus, he cannot participate in the security of the network even if he would like to. This leads to a centralization of power. PoS networks are likely to always be more decentralized as they allow all users to participate in the decentralization and security process. Every player, even the honest whales, protect the network from attack.

For the purposes of this article, let’s stick mainly to energy consumption.

# What does the EU think about excessive energy consumption?

The European Central Bank (ECB) has released a report entitled “[Mining the environment — is climate risk priced into crypto-assets?](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_3~d9614ea8e6.en.html)”, which looks at the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. The report is well written and detailed.

The document says that some crypto-assets have a significant carbon footprint and that this undermines their green transition commitments. Estimates of the carbon footprint for Bitcoin and Ethereum further show that their combined yearly emissions as of May 2022 negate past and target greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings for most euro area countries.

Jurisdictions may also look more closely into the productive use of different energy sources as a result of the recent spike in energy prices following the Russia-Ukraine war. The authors of the paper point out that there is an alternative and much less energy-intensive blockchain technology that can achieve similar results to the energy-intensive ones.

Clearly, the authorities have a well-mapped cryptocurrency space and know the differences between PoW networks and greener alternatives such as PoS. The authors of the paper are aware of initiatives to transition mining to green energy sources. The document mentions the Crypto Climate Accord and the Bitcoin Mining Council.

The drive for greater transparency in mining and the commitment to achieve zero emissions by 2030 is viewed positively. On the other hand, there is criticism that these efforts are only voluntary and that the methodology is not clearly explained, as well as the lack of important details and unreliable data in the documents from these movements.

The transition of PoW mining to green resources is the biggest argument of Bitcoin proponents. However, from the EU’s point of view, this is not a solution, as PoW crypto-assets transition to renewable energy sources, they may crowd out other uses of renewable energy, putting countries’ green transition targets at risk. The document states:

&gt;*Renewable energy is limited. The share of renewables in global electricity generation was 29% in 2020. Hence, it will take time to have a fully renewable energy supply. Using existing renewable energy sources to mine bitcoin generally implies that less renewable energy can be used for other purposes such as providing electricity to households, as well as to eventually cover the required climate transition.*  
*\[…\]*  
*The significant energy consumption weakness of PoW can be addressed by another blockchain consensus mechanism, namely proof-of-stake (PoS). It is estimated that PoS blockchain technology dramatically reduces energy consumption while ensuring the same functionality.*

Public authorities do not want to stifle innovation and technological progress, as this driver of economic growth. On the other hand, authorities have doubts about Bitcoin’s benefits to society. The potential of blockchain technology is so far considered uncertain.

Authorities must look at the whole issue holistically. This perspective is often lacking among cryptocurrency proponents. Authorities must carefully balance the pros and cons. The document goes on to say the following.

&gt;*It is difficult to see how authorities could opt to ban petrol cars over a transition period but turn a blind eye to bitcoin-type assets built on PoW technology, with country-sized energy consumption footprints and yearly carbon emissions that currently negate most euro area countries’ past and target GHG savings.*  
*This holds especially given that an alternative, less energy-intensive blockchain technology exists. To continue with the car analogy, public authorities have the choice of incentivizing the crypto version of the electric vehicle (PoS and its various blockchain consensus mechanisms) or restricting or banning the crypto version of the fossil fuel car (PoW blockchain consensus mechanisms). So, while a hands-off approach by public authorities is possible, it is highly unlikely, and policy action by authorities is probable.*  
*It is highly unlikely that investments in PoW-based assets can be part of an ESG investment strategy. Even so-called green crypto mining would crowd out other, likely more productive uses of renewable energy.*

Whether we like it or not, we don’t think the authorities will be satisfied with the argument that PoW mining can switch to green energy. We must consider that Bitcoin is not the only PoW project and new ones may emerge in the future. To determine the overall negative environmental impact of PoW mining, we need to sum up the consumption of all existing projects. Authorities cannot grant an exemption to one project and ban others. If there is a green alternative to PoW, it is a fair argument that people should use a more environmentally friendly technology.

From our point of view, people should choose what they want to use. Authorities should respect people’s choices and not restrict them. On the other hand, awareness of cryptocurrencies is low among the mass population today, and Bitcoin’s high energy consumption is criticized by experts and the general public. It is not true that everyone who understands Bitcoin necessarily agrees with its high energy consumption. The population will always be divided in opinion and it is questionable how the authorities should approach this, as it is in their job description to take into account the views of both camps and decide in favor of the majority.

We believe that the PoW consensus makes sense if the problem of the declining security budget is somehow resolved. Building network security on the assumption that the value of coins will grow indefinitely doesn’t make much sense. The concept of useful PoW, where computing power is used to solve a real problem, is interesting. PoW can play a significant role in securing blockchain networks, but it is questionable whether it will in the form that Bitcoin is currently using it.

# Conclusion

We understand that people selfishly advocate for their own investment first and foremost, so they feel the need to overlook the needs of other people who don’t have skin in the game. There has not yet been a rational and open debate in the crypto-community on the subject of the over-consumption of electricity. We assume that it will not even take place because the different communities are hostile to each other and have no desire to accept the arguments of the other side. Everything is wrapped in false ideology. Frankly, we are not surprised that the authorities have taken up the issue and feel the need to make a decision. We do not like the possible ban on PoW, but we understand the arguments from the document that was published by ECB.

If we are able to create a more environmentally friendly technology, we have a moral obligation to use it. Nobody wants to live in cities full of dangerous fumes that will shorten our lives. With emission limits on internal combustion engines, we can live much better in cities. The pressure to use more environmentally friendly technology is relevant and in the interests of all people. Decentralized money and services make sense, but not at the cost of sacrificing our planet. In the past, we have often neglected the environment, and we still do. Now almost the entire world is trying to change that and the blockchain industry can’t get a special exemption.

 Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also acknowledged the misdiagnosis coming from her own department, and that of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

""Both of us could have probably used a better word than 'transitory,'"" she told senators in June when asked about their remarks about inflation last year and their slow response to price pressures.

Top officials at the Federal Reserve were seeing inflation data come in very hot for months before policymakers moved to wind down monetary policies that were stimulating the economy.

 It's the Fed's task to tame inflation that is running at a pace not seen in four decades. To do so, it has been hiking interest rates at a fast pace.

Reining in inflation may take more aggressive monetary policy moves than the central bank has embraced in recent years, according to economists like Judd Cramer. His research indicates that the Fed may need to hike rates to levels not seen in decades to force rising prices into retreat.

""If inflation is going to be high and remain higher, that means that the neutral rate in the economy is also going to be higher because the price of goods are going up,"" he said to CNBC.

A June survey of inflation expectations from the New York Federal Reserve suggests the price hikes aren't over yet. The group predicts that by June 2023, prices will have risen approximately 6.8% from their current levels.

Maintaining stable prices and maximizing employment are the Fed's top responsibilities. Jobs appear plentiful in the U.S., which may give the central bank cover to raise interest rates at an aggressive pace through 2023.

Fix the system

- destroy citizens United
- remove the filibuster (?)
- limit lobbying 
- extreme punishments for insider trading / force government officials to only invest in broad market etfs 
- age limits for government officials must be younger than 70 on inauguration date 
- term limits for judicial branch
- implement some level of ranked choice voting 


Energy Independence

- restart keystone pipeline (?)
- continue investments in diverse renewable energy, nuclear as a priority
- expand public transit
- financially support dying industries like coal, provide those workers with income if their jobs are lost, provide 10 year timeline for phasing out coal

Income inequality 

- end corporate socialism / corporate bailouts
- reduce military spending
- tax the wealthy via tax brackets of the 1950s/60s
- use tax revenue to fund education for youth and increase minimum wages to $17 or equivalent COL value
- vacancy taxes for property owners
- one time $10,000 student debt cancellation for low income earners (to get them to shut up)
- liability for student loans moving forward. Treat student loans like business loans. Ability to declare bankruptcy without student loans sticking with you forever
- move to a progressive consumption tax
- add some sort of micro tax on high frequency trading
- crypto regulations 
- legalize sports betting, marijuana and tax the ever living shit out of it (use to fund schools and low income support initiatives)
- redistribute social security from high income earners to low income. No reason for millionaires/billionaires to get identical benefits as senior citizens living in poverty



Broader short term market adjustments

- a transparent interest rate algorithm. i.e. 0.25% interest rate increase each quarter until inflation slows below 3%, 0.25% interest rate decrease quarter until inflation is above 2%

personalfinance,W2 employee moving to “contractor” employee - tax implications?,"I’m a college student currently working as a W2 employee for a summer internship. I have made about $6k so far and paid about $950 in federal taxes. I expect to have made around $10k by the end of the internship. I have an hourly rate of $20.

They offered me a part time position during the school year, and said they would be setting me up as a “contractor” for this. HR hasn’t got this set up yet, so that’s all I know because that’s all my boss said. I assume they mean a 1099 contractor. From what I can find online, I understand that the tax implications are paying 15% out of pocket (no withholdings). I think I’ll make maybe around $2.5k total through December for this. I’m working very low hours, 6-10 a week.

Another layer of complications, is that this job is in a different state than my college. They (TN) have no income tax, but my state (MS) does. They haven’t withheld any from my paychecks (I asked HR to and they waved it off and said it would be okay…). 

How much more money (other than what has already been withheld) could I end up paying in taxes as a contractor? Should I discuss staying on as a W2 employee or getting a pay raise to offset this?

To my understanding, I would get all of my W2 federal taxes refunded since I’ll be under $12550. But then I would have to turn around pay 4% state taxes on my W2 income. Then pay 15%+4% on my contractor income. This seems really complicated??? Can an online service do this for me for free??

I just don’t want a surprise $1k tax expense or something in the spring.

Edit: I just realized something else. If I make 10k from W2 and hypothetically 3k from 1099, would my gross income be 13k and I would no longer get my taxes refunded from the W2?",finance,1658934607

personalfinance,I was offered a contract job (6 month) that pays more than my annual take home salary of my full-time job in the length of the contract. More info in post.,"I was recently recruited by a major company to come on as a contractor for a 6 month contract.  The pay in just the six months will actually be more than my annual take-home salary in my full-time job.  This includes taking 15.8% for self-employment, 11% for federal (I live in a state with no state income tax) and accounting for roughly 680/mo for private health care.  
I love my current job so I'm not itching to leave, but I feel like I've hit a ceiling with my current growth.  I spoke with both the director of the consulting firm and the PM at the major company I would be working under already and expressed my concerns about a 6 month position.  I recently bought a house and will be getting married, added to the fact that we are likely heading towards a recession.  My work is in data analytics and I am currently getting my masters in data science, so I'm not too worried about job opportunities down the line.  Both the director of the consulting company and the PM at the main company have said that the 6 month contract is just what is offered, but there is a very high likelihood that they will extend the contract beyond the 6 months.  In fact, the PM mentioned that the specific project I will be leading is the linchpin in their future digitization and is extremely important.  He also noted that they are currently working on converting two contractors to full-time positions and the consulting firm has no non-compete in place that will bar me from doing the same eventually.  

My main question for PF is will it be a smart move to move from a full-time job that still pays pretty well to a contract position that pays much better for a short period of time with the possibility of upward mobility (but not promised)?",finance,1658936430

cardano,The new digital economy is emerging on Cardano,"In 2015, it was common to say that it was a pity that there were no decentralized exchanges and sandboxes where people could test new concepts. New protocols are emerging on the Cardano platform that people are using to interact with each other. How to understand this and what direction can it take?

**People wanted decentralized services from the start**

Shortly after Bitcoin's inception, there was no infrastructure. The first centralized exchanges made it easy to buy bitcoins and other emerging cryptocurrencies. After the exchanges, other centralized services began to emerge that took advantage of the hype around cryptocurrencies. The first big hacks began to occur. A few owners of centralized services took advantage of their position to steal user deposits. 

A key principle of the blockchain industry is decentralization. It was logical that people started calling for decentralized exchanges and other financial products. It didn't make sense that people could own cryptocurrencies and not be able to do anything sensible with them unless they wanted to take the risk of entrusting them to a third party.  

People wanted peer-to-peer services. Open-source algorithms were supposed to play the role of intermediary for more complex financial transactions. This seemed like a big technological challenge at first. One of the first attempts in 2017 was atomic swaps, which allowed tokens to be exchanged between two blockchains. This technology has not taken off. Soon after, the first DEXes appeared on smart contract platforms. You can deploy your own app on Cardano from 2021. In the same year, the first DEX MuesliSwap was launched on Cardano.

Note that it took approximately 8 years from the inception of Bitcoin before the first swap was attempted. Sometime in 2018, the first decentralized exchanges started to appear. In order to link two blockchains together and allow them to interact, a blockchain bridge is needed. If you own bitcoins and want to participate in DeFi's activities in the Cardano ecosystem, a blockchain bridge will allow you to do so without having to sell your bitcoins.

There are DEXes running on Cardano that allow you to swap ADA, USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH, and other tokens. Everything is decentralized, and there's no need to trust a centralized third party with the private keys to your coins. All you need is a Cardano wallet to access all of Defi's services. 

**Cardano does exactly what all cryptocurrency fans wanted**

In the Cardano ecosystem, no one has to ask anyone for permission to build a decentralized application. Once the application is deployed, anyone can use it without permission. No one has to provide KYC/AML or other private information. It doesn't matter where you are from or what your intentions are. The community demands that third-party applications be open source. Experts can judge the quality of the source code and alert the community if they have any doubts about the quality of decentralization or security. 

Centralized exchanges demand private information from users, can monitor their activity, and abuse their position. The biggest risk is that users' deposits can be stolen by hacked or by the CEO. 

Today, it is no longer necessary to take this risk. Decentralized applications offer similar services to centralized ones. Blockchain networks do not yet scale well enough to meet the demand of the hundreds of millions of users who have accounts on centralized services. However, the IOG team is working diligently on the scalability of the Cardano protocol. Be sure to go check out Defi on Cardano. 

Defi is exactly what bitcoiners and other fans wanted to have. We still want to create a parallel financial system that is as self-sustaining as possible and in which new economic models will emerge. As soon as a team deploys their app, people immediately come and use it. This creates new communities that want to use decentralized services more than traditional banking ones. 

It's perfectly normal for some attempts to fail. Cryptocurrencies are a new environment that is not sufficiently regulated. It's logical that some people will try to scam someone. Scams happen in the real economy too, regardless of the laws. 

Decentralization solves one fundamental issue. It does not matter the character of the person who deploys a decentralized application. As long as the application is well written, and the community can verify this for itself, even the author of the application cannot abuse his position and change the fundamental rules in the application. The decentralized world has the potential to create better conditions for users than what the banking system offers. 

Many bitcoiners criticize NFTs as completely useless tokens. Satoshi wished they would use bitcoins in games. He even suggested creating a virtual poker game that would be part of the bitcoin protocol. The reality is that nobody can predict exactly what will happen in the NFT industry. We certainly wouldn't dare to say that they will disappear completely. In any case, whatever their fate, they have an important role to play in the blockchain industry. New marketplaces are emerging where people are trading tokens. This improves the quality of these services. People can criticize things that don't work. Teams can fix and polish the flaws. This will one day get us to a stage where there is a decentralized marketplace for digital items. 

**What is the future of Defi**

Today tokens are images, but in the near future, they could represent pretty much anything. Even in the case of the internet, no one has predicted exactly how a particular technology will change the world. Sometimes it takes several things coming together to create something that will turn an industry upside down. 

Our feeling is that bitcoiners are envious that decentralized services are emerging on Cardano and other platforms. Basically, nothing substantial has emerged around Bitcoin when it comes to decentralization. When people wanted to get a reward for providing bitcoins and didn't trust Defi, they had to entrust them to centralized services like Celsius. Celsius went bankrupt and ironically did nothing but using the entrusted funds in Defi services. If bitcoiners weren't afraid of Defi, they would still have their bitcoins under control in services that are transparent.

Bitcoin is not important to Defi. Defi needs neither BTC coins nor the PoW security of the Bitcoin protocol. The native coins of the various protocols, on which Defi services are built, play a much more important role. ADA is used to determine the value and as payment for digital objects. In the Cardano ecosystem, you can buy NFT with ADA, not with BTC. It's similar to all the other platforms, which together are used by tens of millions of people. People buy and sell things, lend money to each other, provide liquidity, and even set up new decentralized organizations. People can even financially support the creation of new projects and become their owners through tokens. Is everything automatically a scam just because it doesn't arise around Bitcoin? That's a pretty naive view of the world. 

There will probably never be a Defi around Bitcoin that gets the traction it needs. It seems that the community doesn't even want it, or relies on the second layers who can't do it yet. New digital economies are emerging around smart platforms like Cardano. 

Some people don't believe that Defi is a real and viable business. It's healthy to be skeptical. But it is necessary for them to accept reality. For many people, denial is just posturing. It has nothing to do with skepticism. They are in a phase of denial that necessarily precedes the phase of acceptance. 

When you consider that Defi has only been here for a few years the adoption rate is incredibly fast. We even think adoption is faster than Bitcoin adoption. We don't think that overnight this whole industry is going to disappear for no reason. Technological progress is noticeable every single year. There are hundreds of people working on Cardano. Don't expect new decentralized banks to appear tomorrow or the day after. In 10 years or so, they will almost certainly be here. People have little patience and would like everything now. Technology development and adoption take time on the order of years, not months. 

People in Defi are taught to use ADA coins, which have a fixed monetary policy and are not subject to endless inflation. The question is what role stablecoins will play in this. As for algorithmic stablecoin, cryptocurrencies including ADA will be used as the underlying asset. This means that all users will be in control. No more stable coins will be created unless the necessary amount of ADA coins is locked. Mankind has never had such transparent and fair monetary systems as the blockchain industry offers. 

Defi is still a small industry compared to the traditional world of finance. We are still waiting for a pivotal moment, maybe a few smaller moments, that will draw the masses to Defi. Lending on a decentralized platform needs to be a usable alternative for ordinary people on the street. This can happen with the help of current financial institutions that compete with each other, so they are motivated to try new things. A conventional bank and a decentralized service are not two mutually exclusive things. Even a bank can deploy a smart contract that no one can subsequently change. Bankers can thus be useful assistants who will not be able to abuse their position. 

Cardano has a certain advantage because it places a high emphasis on application security. Learning Haskell/Plutus may be a hurdle for some, but if we want to create reliable services, formal verification is a necessity. For financial institutions, the quality of application source code is an absolute priority. Cardano will appeal to anyone who wants to build secure and reliable applications for the masses. It could be banks and FinTech startups, but it could also be you.

**Conclusion**

Peer-to-Peer interaction between users is a concept that is fundamentally independent of the blockchain. When two people exchange cash for goods face-to-face, it is a Peer-to-Peer interaction. Blockchain brings this model to the digital world, so it works remotely and is not required to be face-to-face. It can even work largely anonymously. Blockchain is an intermediary that acts as a trusted intermediary between participants. This principle is not limited to Bitcoin. 

In terms of functionality, Bitcoin is basically just a transaction network that can do nothing else. Cardano allows financial services to be built on top of the transactional network that can operate without an intermediary. If you use DEX on Cardano to exchange ADA for USDC, it's a more secure way than using the Binance exchange. A lot of people have figured this out. More will join soon. Decentralization is the future of finance regardless of the specific protocol.

When will it?","According to the CDC, [the US has had ~1,140,000 excess deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) since February 1st 2020 than you would normally expect.

We also know that [95% of people](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/coronavirus-deaths-older-adults.html) killed by COVID-19 were 50 or older. [You can see granular breakdown here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex). The highest concentration was amongst the oldest people.

So since 2020 there has been a rather sudden change in the 50+ cohort of Americans.  I can't imagine that this is without consequence of some kind.

A few things I find interesting abut this demographic which we had a sudden change in. 

[Americans 70 and older have stockpiled $35 trillion in wealth](https://www.wsj.com/articles/older-americans-35-trillion-wealth-giving-away-heirs-philanthropy-11625234216) 

&gt; The average inheritance in 2019 was $212,854, up 45% from an inflation-adjusted $146,844 in 1998, according to an analysis of Fed data by economists at a unit of Capital One Financial Corp. [WSJ]

&gt; ...


&gt; Americans age 70 and above had a net worth of nearly $35 trillion, according to Federal Reserve data. That amounts to 27% of all U.S. wealth, up from 20% three decades ago. Their wealth is equal to 157% of U.S. gross domestic product, more than double the proportion 30 years ago, federal data show.

As this cohort dies, millennials and Gen Xers are set to get the largest wealth transfer in history. COVID jumpstarted it.

[~75% of Americans 55+ own a home](https://ipropertymanagement.com/research/homeownership-rate-by-age)

How many excess houses were inherited because of COVID? Are the heirs moving into these houses? Are they offloading them for capital? How long does it take for them to begin to offload them, has it started/ended already? Will it impact the housing market?

How much excess equity was inherited because of COVID? Is it being offloaded relatively quickly or being held onto?

Bitcoin,What does a stabile bitcoin look like?,"We all know that bitcoin will never be a world currency unless it stabilizes.  Many say that in time things will settle down and it will stabilize, this is just not true.  First and foremost, it's appearance of volatility is entirely based on it's value compared to the established reserve currencies (namely,  the US Dollar).  Crypto to crypto pricing is much less volatile.  
Can bitcoin become stabile?  Absolutely!  The only reason the US Dollar looks stabile is because of contracts.  Agreements made between a handful countries ""stabilized"" the USD (and the other currencies as well), it did not just happen by itself.  It is my belief that the same can be done for bitcoin.  After all, if many of us can believe that bitcoin, which is nothing more than some computer code, can have value to keep us fed and sheltered and so much more, then we can also agree to use bitcoin at a contracted value, much like the USD.  
Ideally, we could simply say that 100 Bits = 1 hour of human labor, and then take it from there.  But no one would go for that.  What we can do is slowly transition from USD to bitcoin by way of established market pricing.  
At it's simplest, we have the Lifetime Average (LTA)  which by my calculations is around $8500.  This is too far away from current market value for anyone but the extremely brave to accept as a usable value.  To remedy this, the next step I took was to average in more recent pricing, I chose the Previous Year Average (PYA), which is currently around $46,000, but to help reduce volatility in the calculation I chose to use the first 4 quarters of the previous 5 quarters as the PYA time period.  And finally, in this idea's simplest form, I added the Previous Quarter Average (PQA), which is the 5th of the 5 previous quarters, currently around $32,500.   Finally, at this stage of my work-in-progress, add all three and average,  (LTA+PYA+PQA)/3.  or $29,000-ish.

It's at this point where I ran into some problems, because in spite of this attempt to level the price, there are times when it still varies widely from quarter to quarter.  I am currently working on getting the price to vary no more than +/- 25% between quarters, I realize this is a wide margin and hope to get it to less than +/-10%.  But there is another parameter that makes this difficult, it is my belief that the Universal Bitcoin Contract Price (?) should always be above free-market value to encourage use as a native currency and not a medium of exchange immediately converted to USD or other currency.

To get all of these numbers, I created a spreadsheet using historical date found online, so 2009-Q1 2013 have very limited data, but what I could find I did use.  From Q2 2013 on, I used daily Hi/Lo prices averaged quarterly, so basically 90-ish calendar days averaged.  Any annual averages are based on the quarterlies.  The spreadsheet includes up to date data through the end of Q2 2022.  
I'm not a mathemagician, so I'm sure there is a formula already in existence that can basically compress the numbers to accomplish what I'm trying to accomplish. 

And what am I trying to accomplish?  A stabile, reliable and non-arbitrary price that is free from direct conversion to another currency and can be used in contracts for things such as manufacturing, farming, online sales, etc.  This would be a very big first step in making 1 BTC = 1 BTC.

stocks,Fed hikes interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for second consecutive time to fight inflation,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted its second consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase as it seeks to tamp down runaway inflation without creating a recession.

In taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, the moves in June and July represent the most stringent consecutive moves since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s.

While the fed funds rate most directly impacts what banks charge each other for short-term loans, it feeds into a multitude of consumer products such as adjustable mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The increase takes the funds rate to its highest level since December 2018.

Markets largely expected the move after Fed officials telegraphed the increase in a series of statements since the June meeting. Central bankers have emphasized the importance of bringing down inflation even if it means slowing the economy.

In its post-meeting statement, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cautioned that “recent indicators of spending and production have softened.”

“Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,” the committee added, using language similar to the June statement. Officials against described inflation as “elevated” and ascribed the situation to supply chain issues and higher prices for food and energy along with “broader price pressures.“

The rate hike was approved unanimously. In June, Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissented, advocating a slower course with a half percentage point increase.

The increases come in a year that began with rates floating around zero but which has seen a commonly cited inflation measure run at 9.1% annually. The Fed aims for inflation around 2%, though it adjusted that goal in 2020 to allow it to run a bit hotter in the interest of full and inclusive employment.

In June, the unemployment rate held at 3.6%, close to full employment. But inflation, even by the Fed’s standard of core personal consumption expenditures, which was at 4.7% in May, is well off target.

The efforts to bring down inflation are not without risks.

The U.S. economy is teetering on a recession as inflation slows consumer purchases and dents business activity.

First-quarter GDP declined by 1.6% annualized, and markets were bracing for a reading on the second quarter to be released Thursday that could show consecutive declines, a widely used barometer for a recession. The Dow Jones estimate for Thursday’s reading is 0.3%.

Along with rate increases, the Fed is reducing the size of asset holdings on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Beginning, in June, the Fed began allowing some of the proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off.

The balance sheet has declined just $16 billion since the beginning of the roll-off, though the Fed set a cap of up to $47.5 billion that potentially could have been wound down. The cap will rise through the summer, eventually hitting $95 billion a month by September. The process is known in markets as “quantitative tightening” and is another mechanism the Fed uses to impact financial conditions.

Along with the accelerated balance sheet runoff, markets expect the Fed to raise rates at least another half percentage point in September. Traders Wednesday afternoon were assigning about a 53% chance the central bank would go even further, with a third straight 0.75 percentage point, or 75 basis points, increase in September, according to CME Group data.

The FOMC does not meet in August, instead gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for its annual retreat.

Markets expect the Fed to start cutting rates by next summer, even though committee projections released in June show now cuts until at least 2024.

Multiple officials have said they expect to hike aggressively through September then assess what impact the moves were having on inflation. Despite the 1.5 percentage point increases between March and June, the June consumer price index reading was the highest since November 1981, with the rent index at its highest level since April 1986 and dental care costs hitting a record in a data series going back to 1995.

The central bank has faced critics, both for being too slow to tighten when inflation first started to accelerate in 2021, and for possibly going too far and causing a more severe economic downturn.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told CNBC on Wednesday that she worried the Fed hikes would pose economic danger to those at the lowest end of the economic spectrum by raising unemployment.",finance,1658945027

personalfinance,Can a company force you to take VTO multiple times in a work week,"My wife’s job I feel like is a sinking ship. She’s having her budget constantly cut into for our daughter because several times in a given week they will ask members if they want to take Voluntary Time Off and then pick members to boot offline for the day or give them a write up. She recently was promoted to chat customer support for an online bank, who just months ago announced they were several hundred members over staffed and could no longer migrate everyone back to an office working setting. So now they’re full time work from home. This setting is great for us because it alleviates the need to pay for daycare. 

The problem being in my perspective is that because we’re separated and still married for the time being we still work on a combined budget. With her job stating she is full time, but she is only getting 18 - 26 hours a week because they’re over staffed, now I’m stuck asking work for extra hours which they are more than willing to do but I don’t see this as a financially stable place in our lives for her to coast on a job with hours that aren’t guaranteed anymore. Is it more financially responsible for her to start working with me to look for something else she’s capable of doing? Or is there some action that could be taken against the company that has her status shown as full time but is constantly cutting her hours? I feel there should be some sort of action that needs to be taken before we dip into our savings.",finance,1658946697

CryptoCurrency,Feds just rised interest rate by another 75 point. what does it mean for crypto?,"So what everyone was expecting happened about an hour ago.
Here are my thoughts:

















1. Market was expecting 75 point so this, alone would not come as a surprise or shock. As a matter of fact as I am writing this market slowly going up. 



















2. Bank lending requirements are tightening and that process will accelerate. This mean less and less money for risky investments. Don't know how much institutional investment gonna change tho. And we little guys are mostly out of cash already. So there is that. 



















3. If second quarter numbers look grim (at least worst than everyone predicted)in addition to rate hike it might push the market down further. 


















4. Part of where market goes from here is same as stock market. it depends heavily on how well Feds can manage inflation. If fed rate hikes prove to be successful we might have better days ahead. If not...well it will not be only crypto which would go to doom spiral I suppose.






















5. Next few hours/days will tell us where we stand. I would not buy until I see a nice dive which might never come. Who knows!



















6. For now nothing new/game changing added to the picture. If situation keeps going like this I expect to see a relief rally.",cryptocurrency,1658949215

economy,How does increase in Fed rate tame the inflation?,"Consumer will pay for food, energy and housing to function properly, no matter how high the prices are. Sure, they will cut down on luxury items and other non essentials. So if they are facing inflation wouldn't their house and auto payments going up cause more distress? Although it may decrease an average Lisa's monthly expenditure on Non Essentials, my thinking is that raising interest rate directly raises monthly expenditure on Essentials for those who are in debt (i.e. middleclass who don't have money to buy things on cash). Isn't that opposite of ""taming inflation""? 

Secondly, given that by Fed raising the interest rate the cost of debt to consumer is going to go up. Sure, it will dissuade many new customers from taking on the debt but it would make things a bit more difficult for those who already have debt.

Thirdly, the inflation is largely due to energy (oil and gas) because of external reasons. You won't be changing that anytime soon with increase in the internal interest rate. Right? You are taming inflation only on those non essential sectors while you may end up pricing up the essential sector such as housing and automotive.

Lastly, Personal Consumption is growing at only brisk pace and not so tremendously that it needs to be cooled down. Walmart sees low demand, there is a growing glut of inventory. If interest rate aims to cool demand and hence bring down the prices, where is the high demand that they want to dissuade?

· Labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is way too high

· We are continuing process of significantly reducing our balance sheet. 

· Job growth is slower, but still robust

· Wage growth is increasing

· Inflation is well above goal 

· Although prices for some commodities have turned down, earlier surge has boosted prices, inflation pressure. 

· Another unusually large increase could be appropriate at next meeting. 

· Likely appropriate to slow increases at some point. 

· Further inflation surprises could be in store. 

· *WOULD NOT HESITATE ON LARGER MOVE IF NEEDED GOING FORWARD.*

· Will follow the data we see in the future and take it step by step (Bullish short term here)

· It is difficult to predict the economy’s state in the next 6-12 months with any certainty. 

· Last inflation report was worse than expected. 

· It’s necessary to have growth slow down 

· We think we need a period of growth below potential to create some slack. 

· *STILL BELIEVE THERE IS A PATH TO RESTORE PRICE STABILITY AND BRING INFLATION DOWN WITHOUT CAUSING A RECESSION.*

· *I DO NOT THINK THE US IS CURRENTLY IN A RECESSION WITH HOW GOOD THE LABOR MARKET IS.* 

· GENERALLY, THE GDP NUMBERS CAN BE REVISED. TEND TO TAKE FIRST GDP REPORTS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. 

· In Q2, there was a slowing in demand. It has happened many times where the GDP was negative/weak, but the labor market was strong, and we went on like nothing happened. 

· We will watch both CPI and PCE data, but we still think best measure on inflation is PCE. 

· The slowdown in Q2 is notable

· Getting down to new balance sheet equilibrium could take 2 – 2.5 years.

· Financial Market conditions have tightened “A good bit”. 

· The Fed doesn’t say whether there is a recession or not based on GDP data. 

· A recession is a broad-based decline, and I don’t see that right now, it doesn’t seem like that. 

· Labor market sends strength signal; makes you question GDP. 

· Soft landing has gotten more challenging in recent months. 

· We’re seeing real declines in food consumption",finance,1658950237
btc,What happened at Coinflex? A timeline,"On June 23rd, 2022 Coinflex announced that it was halting all user withdrawals.  Unusually suspicious circumstances surrounding this have transformed this seemingly ordinary insolvency case into an ongoing investigation of suspected fraud.

Timeline of events:

**February 1**

Genesis Trading [raises interest rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/si8bug/bch_shorters_are_getting_desperate_and_they_are/) offered to borrow BCH through the Gemini Earn program.  This leads to suspicion that someone intends to short sell a large amount of BCH.

**April 1**

Interest rates to borrow BCH [are again raised](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ttzarh/after_just_1_month_gemini_yet_again_raises/), now to 5.33%, much higher than other similar cryptocurrencies.

**April 6**

Approximately 462,000 BCH is sent to Coinflex main wallet, mostly from [this address](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/1FjHwcUf7rptVA7Pa3r3RGcdFaNwVYfCwJ) which had been slowly accumulating BCH for months. Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb later [denies](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w5beu2/comment/ih8ynhr/) that this came from Genesis, and stated it was deposits from customers.

**May 9**

Over a few days, roughly 462,000 BCH is removed from [Coinflex main wallet](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/1PJ1rJhedQ5yP8NaCj5J2nAm5pM2hy8pkv)

**May 31**

A large amount of BCH is [deposited at Binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/v1lgmx/binaince_accumulating_about_1mln_bch_on_their_hot/), much of it from Coinflex.

**June 13**

Celsius Network halts withdrawals, triggering panic selling of many crypto assets.  Much of the BCH that had been [deposited at Binance](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/19dQkvaH2NGgkGomzZu3qrnqRGCicXwedM) is sold at this time, causing an especially large price decline in BCH.

Speculators are seen taking advantage of low prices by [buying large amounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vbmq49/on_coinbase_the_majority_of_trades_are_purchases/) of BCH, often more than a [million dollars at a time](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/on_multiple_exchanges_we_see_1020k_of_bch_bids_in/).  However, there is very little BCH for sale at any exchanges other than Binance, and [arbitrageurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vdkplz/on_coinbase_kraken_gemini_bitstamp_there_are_buy/) continuously withdraw from Binance to sell at other exchanges.

**June 18**

18,000 BCH is withdrawn from Coinflex and [mixed with Cashfusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w0d9jg/coinflex_loot_now_being_cashfusioned/).

An additional [10,928 BCH](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/transaction/0ad32ab73ac6fb5db51bbb0a32fcecf6f48d5e1378f5ad317d84a4ab58633b34?i=0) is then withdrawn and mixed, for a total worth approximately $3.5 million USD at the time.

**June 23**

Citing ""extreme market conditions last week &amp; continued uncertainty involving a counterparty,"" Coinflex [halts all withdrawals](https://coinflex.com/blog/coinflex-update-on-withdrawals/).

Coinflex [later explains](https://coinflex.com/blog/coinflexs-solution-to-resume-withdrawls/), ""a long-time customer of CoinFLEX’s account went into negative equity, meaning the Individual’s account currently holds a negative balance.""

**June 24**

Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb [repeatedly denies](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1541904986531037186) that Coinflex is [selling BCH at Binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/comment/idka39o/).

**June 28**

[Rumors](https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1541778973511884802) begin to spread that the customer is Roger Ver.  However, Roger Ver was not short selling, but had a long position.

Roger Ver [denies](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1541822377461415936) owing money to Coinflex, and claims Coinflex owes him money.

Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb [says](https://twitter.com/MarkDavidLamb/status/1541831697787928576) ""Roger Ver owes CoinFLEX $47 Million USDC.""

**July 2**

Doug Polk, who Coinflex had a marketing agreement with, [claims he was deceived](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vps8o1/doug_polk_full_statement_on_coinflex_situation/).  Coinflex had told him that assets were fully collateralized, which was untrue, and that Roger Ver was ""just an investor"" and not involved in the operation of the company.

**July 10**

Despite withdrawals ostensibly being halted, [100,000 BCH is withdrawn](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vvitgf/coinflex_selling_more_bch/) from Coinflex, of which [68,000 BCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vvitgf/comment/iflyvw0/) is sold at Binance. Mark Lamb [continues to claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w5beu2/comment/ihc3juh) that Coinflex is not selling at Binance, and that these are ""withdrawals from our users, to Binance.""

**July 14**

Coinflex offers [limited withdrawals](https://coinflex.com/blog/update-july-14-2022/) of 10% of account balances if users agree to their new terms.

**July 22**

Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb states that Coinflex does not intend to [file for bankruptcy](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w5beu2/comment/ih77xej/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Presumably they expect that most customers will accept the partial payout offer.",cryptocurrency,1658950774

stocks,"The definition of ""recession"" hasn't recently been changed","Let's compare:

**Currently, from the NBER website:**  *a recession involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.*

**From a 2009 St. Louis Fed report, referring to the NBER definition:**  *significant decline in economic activity spreading across the economy, lasting more than a few months*

&amp;#x200B;

You can think the definition is silly or wrong or something else, but you can't think it was recently changed.  The amount of misunderstanding on this point in this sub is baffling to me.

&amp;#x200B;

And no, it isn't the case that every economics textbook says otherwise.  From Mankiw's Principles of Economics, 8th edition, page 485:

*The upward climb of real GDP is occasionally interrupted by periods during which GDP declines, called recessions. Figure 2 marks recessions with shaded vertical bars.

CryptoCurrency,"If Everything Was Priced In, Doesn't It Mean The Bullish Momentum Is Already Priced In As Well?","many bulls on twitter and even here on reddit said the market was already ""priced in"", hence why now the market has been going up despite the Fed raised interest rate by 75 bps once again. But using the same logic, can't we say the same thing about bullish momentums?

Market generally has been going up since mid June until now, bitcoin was below $18K at the time and now it's almost $23K. doesn't that mean whatever trigger the current bullish movement won't sustain since it's also already priced in?

For example, many media outlets claimed Ethereum Merge triggered the recent bullish price action for Ethereum. But using this logic, that means the market will dump after the day of the Merge itself, since the bullish momentum is ""priced in"" too early?",cryptocurrency,1658951680

personalfinance,Just found out I have a lower APY savings account with Capital One than their current offering...anything I can do to get what I missed out on?,"Hi all. Lately I've been on a finance and investing research kick, and last night I was checking savings account interest rates.

I noticed that Capital One currently has a savings account APY of 1.3%, but I saw that my current savings account with them is paying me much less (0.30%). I called and discovered that I actually have a different type of savings account, even though they only advertise one on their website. I have the 360 Savings, and the higher-yield one is called 360 Performance Savings.

This was hugely disappointing to find out that for the past few years I have missed out on this higher rate because I never knew there was a different type of savings account I needed to create in order to get that rate.

In fact, nothing other than the APY seems different about the accounts, so why are there even two different types? Why didn't they just adjust the APY of my current account type to 1.3%? It almost feels like they created a new type of account on purpose so that existing customers wouldn't automatically get the higher rate.

Is there any recourse I have to get the extra interest I would have earned over the past few years?

We originally wanted to save for 20% downpayment and try to get a 300k or less house but that seems like a pipe dream in this economy and in our HCOL city / suburbs. We have almost 200k in savings just sitting right now. My original income before going part time was almost 90k a year but the cost of daycare vs staying at home was pretty obvious to us. 

I am just now getting into financial planning for us and reading some books, looking on reddit etc. We basically have no idea what to do with anything and have just been pocketing cash away in our stupid money market accounts. SOS 

**My questions in need of answering / advice:** 

Should we just pay off the 95K of total loans he has in full? Should we attempt to do PSLF and pay minimum payments for 10 years even though it might be a 10-15k difference? Should we try to put like 45-50k towards his loans before interest starts back up again and then consolidate and do PSLF? 

Should we invest in stock market w/ my traditional roth or via our retirements, on robin hood, buy crypto? Should we max them out contributing 10-15 percent? Should we be doing anything else with our retirement? 

Should I try to get another part time job or work from home to gain more annual income? I have it pretty cush right now working 2 days a week but am feeling the huge decrease in annual income. Should my husband try to gain more income by switching jobs or moving up the ladder? We both have masters but our jobs right now have been great for childcare. 

What else should we be doing? should we both try to switch jobs to make more money? get a financial planner (don't really want to because I am stubborn, frugal, and feel like I can learn enough from reddit, books, etc). 

Help me reddit. I looked at the resources on PF and have looked at the OG flowsheet. Hard to know what to do specifically in this economy as well as what to do so our future is financially ""secured"". Whatever that means. SOS

**TLDR: We make OK money together in a HCOL where our money doesn't go far, have almost 200k in cash savings, 95K in husbands loans, No CC debt or car payments, 2,200 in rent a month + other minimal expenses ($500-650 month). Do we pay off his 95K loans with our hard cash right now vs take a gamble with PSLF + high monthly payments for the next 6-7 years, save for shitty house next, then max retirement, save for our kids future after?**",finance,1658953740

stocks,My Cherry-Picked take on earnings reports so far: all indications of a strong American consumer in Q2; what will Q3 bring?,"Are earnings for this quarter behaving like we are in a recession? My take is the 'earnings compression' if it does happen will have to be postponed to Q3 instead of Q2, by which points inflation will really cool down (based on crashing commodity prices, falling gas prices, tightening real estate, food crisis being overblown). So far, we are not seeing changes in the earning denominator sufficient to really increase P/E ratios dramatically. These are obviously cherry-picked, but I tried to add as many examples and statements as I could. If the consumer really were so weak, you wouldn't see so many contrarian statements from major banks, restaurant chains, auto makers, credit card processors, etc. GDP/inflation numbers are very aggregative metrics, so let's dive into what the actual companies are reporting.

I will not link to where many of these quotes come from due to time and this not being an academic paper, but I took most of them from the news articles in Bloomberg/CNBC/Seeking Alpha and can be googled for verification.


**Big Banks**: 

- JPM expects credit losses to remain abnormally low through much of 2023, because customers haven’t yet drained cash balances that grew fatter during the pandemic, executives said Monday. “Big picture, the near-term credit outlook, especially for the U.S. consumer, remains strong,” said CFO Jeremy Barnum. 
- C: ""Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight.
- BAC: ""Our U.S. consumer clients remained resilient with continued strong deposit balances and spending levels,"" said CEO Brian Moynihan. Earlier this month, BofA said credit and debit card spending rose 11% in June.

**Restaurants/Food:**

- Chipotle/MCD report weakening demand from lower income consumers, but overall strong sales beats. In MCD, they see more substitution from fancier restaurants to MCD, and for Chipotle, they already cater to a slightly richer crowd.
- Major beat from KO. “We continue to see resilience and a lot of demand not just in the U.S. but across the world,” Coke Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said. Consumers who missed experiences such as dining out and entertainment during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic are willing to spend more now, Coke Chief Executive James Quincey said. Executives said the company is preparing for consumers’ purchasing power to come under increasing pressure in the second half of the year.

**Credit Card:** 

- Visa reporting strong consumer and lots of travel. ""Consumers are back on the road, visiting various corners of the world, resulting in cross-border travel volume surpassing 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began in early 2020,"" said Chairman and CEO Alfred F. Kelly, Jr."" 

**Auto:**

- GM wrote ""“I would say that at the end of the day, all the data that we’ve seen to date on vehicle pricing and demand remains strong…we still think that there is a big pocket of demand that hasn’t been met yet.""  Tuesday, GM said it expects to make more money in the second half of the year. 
- F expects earnings to triple
- Mercedes: said it expects demand for its vehicles to outstrip supply for the rest of the year.

**Travel:**

- Hilton sees strong growth: The hotel industry has benefited from people spending on travel as well as hotel stays, though rising interest rates and tight financial conditions are stoking fears of a recession. However, credit card and other data indicate that travel demand is likely to remain robust.

**Software/tech:**

- MSFT with such strong guidance it brought the whole market up after its earnings. Azure grew 40% quarter over quarter, a very slight slowdown.
- Spotify eclipsed forecasts and added 6mn subscribers to its service in the second quarter, defying the slowdown at Netflix that has weighed on the music company’s stock price. The company ended June with 188mn subscribers, beating its guidance for 187mn. Total users — which includes those who do not pay — also beat expectations, rising to 433mn.
- JPM on Google after earnings: ""Our primary takeaway is that search’s demand is persistent even in a tough macro advertising environment given its consistent and high ROI while benefiting from its diversification across online and offline as well as across verticals and geographies""

**Ecommerce:**

- Etsy with major beats. ""The company acquired 6M new buyers during the quarter, shaking off concerns of post-pandemic deceleration.""
- AMZN prime day: ""The expanded inventory must have played a key role in enabling Amazon Prime Day 2022 to become the single biggest Prime Day event in its history, with members purchasing more than 300 million items worldwide. ""

**Logistics:**

- FedEx and UPS both beat and affirmed guidance. Daily volume *did* decline, but from historically high levels during the pandemic. [Is this a collapse in the consumer?](https://i.imgur.com/IBDkf8r.png)

**Housing:**

-  D R Hortons: ""The recent DHI results show that the post-pandemic overheated housing market is beginning to cool off. During the third quarter, the company recorded 16,693 new orders which were down 8% YoY. The net new orders slumped due to a meaningful rise in cancellations which rose to 24% as the rapid rise in mortgage rates created a minor panic among homebuyers. However, the good news is that management has mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that the reselling demand is quite good, and the cancellations are being resold smoothly.""

**Commerce Department Data on Retail**:

- ""U.S. retail sales climbed in June by more than forecast in a broad advance, suggesting resilient consumer spending despite decades-high inflation and raising the prospects of an even larger Federal Reserve interest-rate hike this month. The value of overall retail purchases [in June] increased 1%, after an upwardly revised 0.1% decline in May, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. *The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation*.""

**Non-Examples**:

- Retail like WMT/TGT got crushed, but... with the totality of this data, suggests they had poor execution for inventories. They had an issue acquiring good, overbought, and now have to slash prices to get rid of excess inventory. That's less weakening of consumer demand and more bad planning.
- QComm sees weaker smartphone demand, but on the other hand, AAPL sources say strong demand for its iPhone in China.
- Best Buy: The retailer said it expects same-store sales to decline around 11% for the fiscal year, compared with the drop of between 3% and 6% that it forecast in May. 
- DPZ had big miss.",finance,1658956930

personalfinance,First-time Home Buyer - Normal Anxiety or Can't Afford It?,"Hello everyone,

This is my first time posting to this forum. I am hoping to become a first-time home owner sometime this year, and I'm currently under contract on a single family home I ADORE but am suddenly panicking that perhaps I can't actually afford it. I'm having a hard time discerning if my panic is an indication that I truly can't afford this house even if I love it, or run-of-the-mill anxiety as a first-time buyer.

Details:  
187k sale price with no appraisal gap to cover, 20% down and 5.250% interest rate on a 30 year fixed rate loan with no points to lock in the rate. Property taxes around 4.4k/year with annual increase up to 5%. Single family home, 3bed/1ba, 1020 sq ft, with a semi-finished basement and garage. Inspection basically found nothing wrong with the house, it's in great condition. Roof is newer (2015) although mechanicals are older (20ish years for HVAC and water heater).

This works out to be around 1,250-1,275/mo in PITI with escrows. Adding in estimated utilities and saving 1% annually for maintenance I get around $1600-1675/mo all considered.

I am a contingent/contract nurse with income that is therefore somewhat subject to change. I make 65-85k/yr. I have no debt, am graduating with a master's degree this month, and own a used car in fairly good condition. My only unique expenses are health insurance premiums (350-400/mo) and time off (no PTO but I take 4 weeks off per year). I have a rental lease I may need to pay through if I can't find a suitable subletter, so after the down payment, closing costs, and possibly paying through my lease, I'm left with around 40k in liquid savings for emergencies and other needs. I am unmarried and have no dependents and no plans to have children anytime soon. My retirement savings are embarrassingly meager as I prioritized paying for school and a used car out of pocket and saving for a downpayment/emergencies. I currently pay a measly 2.5% into my 403b and think I have around 6.5k in there, not all of which I'm yet vested in.

My master's will increase my income in a few years but not immediately. I expect to be able to earn in the same bracket, 65k min - 85k max, aiming for around 70-75k.

I would feel 100% comfortable buying something in the 140-160k price range, however, in this area there simply isn't much for sale and what there is isn't very attractive. The best alternatives that I can see for buying are condos in the 150-160k range (those come with \~460/mo in HOA fees with property taxes included, a plus) or trying to buy a house with a friend. Renting is a viable alternative; I currently rent with roommates and my monthly expenses ALL inclusive (rent, utilities, food even) are \~850. If I wanted to rent on my own, which I would probably do starting next year if I did not buy a house or a condo, an apartment I love and feel happy with would be around $1300+electric/mo. Comparable single family homes in the area would rent at around 1500-1600/mo.

It seems like it is by only the most conservative ""rules"" (e.g. Dave Ramsey's) that I can't afford this home, and by most standards it is affordable at best or at the edge at worst. It's certainly far under what I was pre-approved for and what most calculators spit out as ""how much house I can afford."" Still, when I read these forums, the two pieces of advice that have stuck out to me the most were base it off the monthly payment, and, if you're worried you can't afford it you probably can't. The monthly payment does feel like a bit of stretch, being more than double what I'm paying currently.

Thoughts? What advice would you give your daughter?",finance,1658962108
investing,The 8 economists who decide if the U.S. is in a recession,"(The Washington Post) -- The 8 economists who decide if the U.S. is in a recession

Democrats  and Republicans have begun arguing over whether the U.S. economy is in a  recession ahead of a key data release on Thursday. But the official  pronouncement will ultimately come down to a little-known group of  economists selected by the National Bureau of Economic Research called  the “Business Cycle Dating Committee,” which stubbornly takes its time  and tries to wall itself off from political interference or attempts to  spin its findings.

The  stakes for the group are high, in part because of the extraordinarily unusual economic conditions two years after the last recession, early in the coronavirus pandemic. The economy contracted in the first quarter  of the year, and many Republicans say a recession is here already, with  Thursday’s release expected by many analysts to show a second  consecutive quarter of negative growth. But from President Biden down,  administration officials are instead pointing to other indicators  showing the economy remains strong and insisting the committee would be wrong to declare a recession.

The  political haggling is not supposed to matter to the eight economists  who rule on when recessions start. Their decision is almost certainly  months away, if it comes at all: The committee typically waits long  after a recession has begun to declare it, only acting when the evidence  has become overwhelming, sometimes even after the recession is already  over. That puts the pressure bearing down on the organization from the  outside — to promptly render a verdict on one of the most important  matters facing economic policymakers — directly at odds with its mission  to provide unassailable empirical decisions.

As  a result, what seems like a straightforward question — is the U.S.  economy in a recession? — is in part decided on a subjective basis at a  later date, sometimes when it no longer appears pertinent, by experts in  closed-door meetings of a privately selected committee.

“By  far, the most important thing to try to convey is that the committee is  not trying to do real-time dating of whether we’re in a recession,”  said MIT economics professor James Poterba, the NBER president and a  member of the committee, in an interview. “There’s often enormous amount  of interest in that question and what many people are hoping for, but  the committee’s task is to create a consistent historical record of the  turning points — the peaks and the troughs in the U.S. economy.”

The  group’s calculus could become increasingly fraught in the following  months, amid puzzling economic conditions that defy easy  characterization. The political consequences for the committee could be  significant, as the Biden administration faces growing public anger over  high inflation and its economic stewardship. Congressional Republicans  will also be eager to seize on a ruling that the economy is in a  recession, trying to capitalize on voter discontent ahead of this fall’s  midterm elections.

Asked  about the upcoming economic numbers, Biden on Monday disputed the  notion that a recession was imminent. That is part of a broader  administration campaign in recent weeks to rebut GOP claims that a  recession has already begun. Top economic officials, including Treasury  Secretary Janet L. Yellen and White House National Economic Council  Director Brian Deese, appeared on cable TV news Sunday and Monday to  reiterate their view that the U.S. economy is not technically in  recession — and wouldn’t be even if the GDP numbers show a second  consecutive quarter of contraction.

This  strategy has its risks, though, because if the United States does enter  a recession later, their current assurances will look misguided —  particularly after the administration already incorrectly dismissed the  threat of inflation last year.

“We’re  not going to be in a recession, in my view. The \[unemployment\] rate is  still one of the lowest we’ve had in history,” Biden said on Monday. “My  hope is we go from this rapid growth to steady growth.”

At  the core of the challenge facing the committee of economists is that it  relies on more than a half-dozen criteria to measure when a recession  has begun. The general impression many Americans — and some commentators  — have is that a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of  negative economic growth. But that is not how the NBER, or most  economists, think of it. Instead, the committee weighs factors such as  payroll levels, retail sales, industrial production and personal income  when making a comprehensive assessment about whether the economy is in  recession. The committee stresses on its website that “there is no fixed  rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how  they are weighted in our decisions.”

As  Deese told CNN: “In terms of the technical definition, it’s not a  recession — the technical definition considers a much broader spectrum  of data points.”

Traditionally,  all these various economic metrics move in tandem, making the  committee’s job easier. Usually, when growth declines, so do employment,  consumer activity and the other measures of economic health. But the  economy since the start of the pandemic has confounded prior models and  may do so again. Economic growth may end up declining for two  consecutive quarters — although the first quarter in the United States  was negative due largely to technical factors, such as a temporary  uptick in overall imports — even as unemployment remains among the  lowest levels in American history. Consumer spending has remained  strong, too, in a way at odds with a typical recession. If unemployment  remains low even as growth contracts, the NBER economists could face a  vexing challenge in deciding how to categorize the situation.

Predicting  the committee’s decision is made more difficult by the way in which it  operates. As part of the NBER, the Business Cycle Dating Committee is  run by a private nonprofit group — not the federal government or a state  statistical agency. Its membership is selected by the president of the  NBER “in consultation” with the committee chair, according to Poterba.

The  committee’s meetings are not publicized. They’re held in a closed-door  conference room on the third floor of the Cambridge, Mass., office  building where NBER is headquartered. They don’t meet on a fixed  schedule: Board Chairman and Stanford economist Bob Hall is responsible  for calling the meetings. During long periods of consistent economic  growth, the board can go years without having anything to discuss, and  therefore, it might hold no meetings. It wouldn’t even confirm when past  meetings have happened.

“The committee does not announce its meeting schedule, and that’s something we don’t talk about,” Poterba said.

Its last public pronouncement came on July 19, 2021 — when [the committee declared](https://www.nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-july-19-2021) that there had been a recession between February and April 2020, the shortest one in U.S. history.

The  eight economists on the committee are among the most respected in their  field. Some have served in Democratic administrations, but past members  have also included GOP appointees. In addition to Poterba and Hall, the  members are Christina Romer and David Romer of the University of  California at Berkeley; James Stock, of Harvard; Robert Gordon, of  Northwestern; Valerie Ramey, of the University of California at San  Diego; and Mark Watson, of Princeton.

The  NBER has its roots in the period following World War I, after a  Columbia-trained economist who worked for labor and trade organizations  and the chief statistician at AT&amp;T formed a new organization after  realizing they had little shared empirical data with which to conduct  policy debates. In the early 1960s, the Commerce Department began  publishing a digest on business conditions that cited the NBER’s work on  the ups and downs of the business cycle, giving it a kind of federal  imprimatur, according to Poterba.

Poterba  stressed that the board is aware of public hunger for guidance about a  recession but does not let it dictate their decisions. Economic data is  often later revised, and the committee is careful not to announce a  verdict that is contingent on data that could later be changed.

“The  NBER is really trying to provide guideposts for researchers; it’s not  trying to provide short-term political talking points for either party,”  said Steve Miran, who served as a senior official in the Treasury  Department under Donald Trump’s administration and is the co-founder of  Amberwave Partners, an investment fund. “We’d all like it to be binary —  0 to 1, recession or not — but the truth is it’s much more of  continuum. It requires interpretation of the length, depth and speed of  the contraction, as well as which sectors of the economy are contracting  and why. … And that requires an element of judgment.”

Still,  that does not mean the board’s members are always in agreement. Harvard  economist Jeffrey Frankel, who served as a member of the committee for  roughly 25 years, said there is usually unanimity about the broad  questions of whether a recession is beginning or ending, but differences  can emerge about precisely what month a recession began or ended.

“There  are times when the right answer is not clear, and the kind of thing  there may be disagreement about is someone wanting more data — like  revisions to the \[gross domestic product\], for instance — and someone  else saying, ‘It’s already been 11 months, and if we wait longer people  will think the news will be too stale,’ ” Frankel said. “That tension is  always an issue.”

stocks,"Market Not Making Sense, What’s Bullish?","I know the saying “markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent”, I have to say that’s never rang truer than this bear market but curious from a bull’s perspective - what is bullish? 

Many bulls are betting on a pivot toward the beginning of next year once a recession becomes evident. For two years it was constantly repeated to “not bet against the Fed” and now Bulls are doing exactly that. They have no clue if the Fed is going to back off at the end of this year, in fact Powell isn’t signaling he is going to at all. To me it appears they are just hoping they do. With the bond market holding at approximately 2.7%, the Fed only has to hike one more time and basically be done. I don’t foresee 2.7% to hold as further inflation readings come out. 

But let’s say he does pivot - how does that benefit the economy? There’s no way the rate hikes that have been implemented are doing enough damage to inflation to suggest that QE would be a good idea next year. If they lowered rates only a year after starting, that would just further lead to a stagflationary environment where consumers will continue to be priced out of everything - leading to another inevitable inflationary recession or the prolonging of the one we are entering. It would be a bandaid on  a much bigger wound that needs adequate medicine - a hardcore high unemployment recession. 

Without high unemployment inflation can not go down. It’s simply not possible. They need to push people out of work in order to conduct true demand destruction. We have started seeing hiring freezes and slight layoffs in certain companies, but nothing in terms of the magnitude to adequately conduct demand destruction. I firmly believe Powell won’t back off until he sees higher unemployment. He consistently repeats that the labor market is strong and is suggesting we aren’t going into a recession, so if that’s true how is that bullish? If anything he’s stating how strong things are and it gives him even more of a reason to hike. He reiterates the same thing over and over - we have a strong labor market. 

So to me we get two options: either a Fed that hikes into a recession and high unemployment and he meets his goal of demand destruction to tackle inflation or he pivots and further contributes to higher inflation and leads to a recession anyway. I am a bull long term, but the current times mimic the depression. The roaring 20s were due to QE after the war (this time COVID), unchecked speculative investing and inflation, and a behind the curve Fed that started tightening into a recession.  Earnings also haven’t been looking great, with big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta missing. Apple is up tomorrow as well and I anticipate a miss, especially after seeing Walmart’s atrocious miss. So genuinely curious (and not looking for hate, I am a bear short term but bull long term) - what is bullish?",finance,1658964027

personalfinance,My parents suddenly decided to pull my college funding. What are my options?,"Sorry if some of this is just Google-able, I'm overwhelmed and scared right now. 

Heading into my second year of college but pretty much have all my GEs completed so I don't think there's much I could do at a community college. I'm at a very prestigious public university but living at home for the summer. Been arguing with my parents a lot and they just pulled my funding and told me they don't want me to go to college in the fall as I have been getting poor grades. I thought they weren't serious but now it is clear they are. They never told me there was a GPA stipulation to their money and never cared that I was struggling mentally until they finally saw it reflected in my grades. 

What are my options for paying? I obviously still want to go, although I'm scared my parents are right and maybe I can't handle college, as I've been struggling so far. I was a straight A student in high school but college has been really difficult for me. I'm in therapy and taking medication but still struggling. 

Anyway, if I do decide to go, can I fill out the FAFSA as an independent or is it too late? Should I apply for federal and private loans? I'll also look into getting a job while at school. I don't think being extra busy will make it EASIER to get good grades, but yknow it is what it is...

Edit: A lot of people seem to be telling me not to go back, which I will take into consideration. I'm frustrated at my parents because last year, during the height of the pandemic, when classes were online and when I was ACTUALLY doing really poorly mentally, I pleaded and begged with them for a gap year so that I could work/get my head on straight/take community college classes. They refused because they said it wasn't worth my time and that community college classes were ""beneath me"". I can't believe the irony that they want me to do the same thing now.

stocks,Inflation on your mind? Here are some TIPS* for you…,"###Turns Out Hawkish Jay Might Be Transitory?


We’re all very aware of inflation.  Most people have felt it at least a little in their lives from gas prices, groceries, rent, staples, travel, and so on.  Some investors and traders expect inflation to be persistent and uncomfortably high for a while.  They might even be very bullish on the market in the medium-term but want to have at least some cash to ride out volatility for an emergency or hedge against potential large declines.

They may feel forced into a false dichotomy that either they have to see cash burn in real terms or speculate on the short-term direction of the market.  Turns out there are ways to potentially protect your cash if inflation ends up being more persistent than we all think.  One of those solutions is **TIPS – aka Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities**.  Who are examples of people that might consider buying them?

* Someone looking to park cash to make a large purchase of some kind next year that can remain illiquid until that time but concerned that inflation will be very high.
* Someone bullish looking to hedge a highly growth tilted portfolio – “keeping some dry powder” on the side.
* Older investors looking to protect the value of cash expecting interest rates to rise further.
* Bearish trader speculating on a market decline but not wanting to go all-in the high risk of shorting the market either directly or with options.

###How do they work?

TIPS are just like regular Treasury bonds.  They have a fixed coupon rate that is applied to its face value twice a year to pay interest.  The key difference however is that the face value or principal is continually updated to reflect changes in the CPI-U index (the general urban CPI index we are all familiar with on the news).

TIPS are issued and auctioned by the US Treasury in 5, 10, and 30 year terms.  Since their scheduled auction and maturity dates have effectively been [scattered throughout the year](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.pdf) you will always be able to find whatever term you are looking for, and they can be purchased from your broker.


###Accrued Principal

The adjusted principal or accrued principal is the most important part of a TIPS bond.  The way it is calculated is by multiplying the original face value by the **CPI Index Ratio** also called “inflation factor”.  It is equal to the current CPI divided by the CPI index when the bond was issued.  Thus Index Ratio = (Reference CPI current date / Reference CPI issue date).

These index ratios can be verified and calculated just using [BLS data]( https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/) but the [Treasury also just publishes them for you.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/tipscpi/tipscpi.htm)  Most brokers will include all this data on their client portal or trading UI.  

Here’s an example of a TIPS bond with the following ID, [CUSIP - 912828UH1]( https://i.imgur.com/PA5RVX9.png).  It has three key dates 1) Issue date 2) Dated date 3) Maturity date.  The issue and maturity is the same as a regular bond.  The “Dated date” is the reference date to begin the CPI calculation, often middle of the month a couple weeks before the bond was auctioned, usually Jan 15th or Aug 15th.

For this bond, the dated date CPI is 230.82203 the CPI on January 15, 2013.  The CPI today is 291.88477 the “daily reference CPI”.  So the index ratio or inflation factor is 291.88477/230.82203 = 1.26454.  Hence the adjusted principal for each $1000 of face value is $1,264.54.

The adjusted principal is key because that moving balance is basically what coupon rates will be applied to on coupon dates and finally whatever it has climbed to is what you receive at maturity.  It is fairly straight-forward and intuitive but there is one small but very important detail to be aware of.  The CPI reference is lagging behind by three months.  

That means that the dated date (CPI at issue) is 1/15/2013 but in reality the CPI used is 10/15/2012.  Similarly the reference daily CPI today is actually 4/27/2022 not 7/27/2022 (today)!  I am not sure what the reason for this is but if I had to guess it is because of data lags that used to exist and the time needed to publish CPI. In any case, this means that if you buy TIPS today they *do not yet include hot months of May, June, and anything that happened in July*!  Since CPI is published by month, a simple linear interpolation (straight average) is used to calculate CPI days between months.

###Effective Yield

Finally, the effective yield is what you would expect on an annualized basis assuming consumer prices were completely stable going forward.  It is determined the exact same way as a regular bond except the face value is the current daily accrued principal.  The Wall Street Journal has a nice table of all TIPS yields (if someone knows of a better table to compare yields please let me know).

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/tips

Today yields went down quite a bit based upon what was perceived as dovish Fed guidance which one would expect to be inflationary.  But if you look at the April 15 2024 TIPS, it has a yield of -.18% which is close to 0.  That means that most of the gain from this bond will be from inflation.  If somehow inflation were 0 from here you would basically break even.  

A regular Treasury bond with a maturity of 4/15/24 has a yield of 3.034%.  The difference between these two numbers can be used to calculate the **break-even rate**.  3.034-(-.18) = 3.214% is the *market’s expected annualized rate of inflation* for the next 21 months.

##*This is the critical number to look at when placing your bet.  If you think inflation will be higher than this figure you should buy TIPS.  If you think inflation will be lower you buy the normal Treasury instead.*

###Final Thoughts

So there you have it, this is one tool to potentially hedge a bit against inflation.  Some might also like precious metals, energy / commodities, or BTC.  One strong advantage of TIPS is its stability and guaranteed nature of at least keeping up with inflation.  Pretty much nothing else can do this and basically the taxpayer foots the bill if inflation goes substantially higher than what regular Treasuries are pricing.

stocks,Sectors that benefit from rising interest rates,"Banks

Rising rates tend to point to a strong economy. And that health usually means that borrowers have an easier time making loan payments and banks have fewer [non-performing assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-performing-assets.asp). It also means that banks can earn more from the spread between what they pay (to savers for [savings accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savingsaccount.asp) and [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp)) and what they can earn (from highly-rated debt like Treasuries).

Banks that might benefit as rates rise include Bank of America Corp. ([BAC](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=bac)), which has a substantial presence throughout the U.S.; JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ([JPM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm)), with its robust operations in the U.S. and worldwide; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ([GS](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=gs)), with widespread [investment banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-banking.asp) and [wealth management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealthmanagement.asp) services, and Citigroup Inc. ([C](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=c)), which does business in more than 160 countries.2 

### Brokers

On the [broker](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) front, companies like E\*TRADE Financial Corp., Charles Schwab Corp. ([SCHW](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=schw)), and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., all hold promise during times of escalating rates for similar reasons. A healthy economy sees more investment activity and brokerage firms also benefit from increased [interest income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-interest-income.asp) when rates move higher.

### Insurers

Insurance stocks can flourish as rates rise. In fact, the relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear, meaning the higher the rate, the greater the growth. These same insurance providers, such as The Allstate Corp. ([ALL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=all)), AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. ([AFSIN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=afsin)), and The Travelers Companies, Inc. ([TRV](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=trv)), don’t fare as well in low-rate climates because their underlying bond investments yield weak returns.

Insurers, which have steady cash flows, are compelled to hold lots of safe debt to back the insurance policies they write. In addition, the economic health dividend also applies to insurers. Improving [consumer sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-sentiment.asp) means more car purchasing and improving home sales, which means more policy-writing.

## Beyond Financials

Financials aren’t the only star performers in a rising rate environment. [Consumer discretionary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-discretionary.asp) stocks also can see a bump because improving employment, coupled with a healthier housing market, makes consumers more likely to splurge on purchases outside of the realm of [consumer staples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerstaples.asp) (food, beverages, and hygiene goods).

Manufacturers and [sellers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) of kitchen appliances, cars, clothes, hotels, restaurants, and movies also benefit from the economic health dividend. Companies to keep an eye on during interest rate increases include appliance maker Whirlpool Corp. and retailers Kohl's Corp., Costco Wholesale Corp., and Home Depot, Inc. 

Finally, the industrials sector also benefits from the economic health dividend indicated by rising rates. Companies like Ingersoll-Rand PLC and manufacturers of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, tend to [outperform](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outperform.asp), as well as companies like PACCAR, a maker of heavy-duty trucks and truck parts. Such companies are among the first to benefit from any increase in [housing starts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housingstarts.asp).",finance,1658977591

 ***Mr. Levy is chief economist at Bank of America.*** 

Oct. 9, 2007 12:01 am ET 

 

Despite recent financial turmoil and a dismal housing market, there are key reasons why the economy will continue to expand, albeit at a modest pace, and not go into recession. Businesses are well poised to absorb a period of weaker product demand and are unlikely to significantly alter their hiring and investment behavior. Consumer spending is supported by rising incomes. Exports are strong. And monetary policy is consistent with sustained growth in domestic demand. Next year, we will look back and once again marvel at the flexibility and resilience of the economy.

To be sure, there is bad news. Housing construction and prices will continue to fall at least through 2008. There is an 18-year high in the inventory of unsold homes and soft sales that are constrained by several factors, including expectations that home prices have further to fall.

The surge in home ownership, which rose dramatically to nearly 70% in 2005 from 64% in 1994, has proved just as unsustainable as the reliance on subprime mortgages. That surge has begun to recede, and lower prices and onerous adjustable-rate mortgage resets point toward a modest further decline -- each one percentage point represents about one million homes. That decline, along with foreclosures, will elongate the housing inventory adjustment, exert downward pressure on prices, keep builders on the sidelines, and shrink employment in construction and the home finance sector.

 U.S. businesses are poised to withstand contraction.

During the late stages of prior economic expansions, as product demand slumped in response to excessive monetary restriction, firms tended to maintain production and employment growth, resulting in large inventory overhangs. Business capital spending also tended to grow too rapidly -- witness the late 1990s investment boom. Consequently, most of the decline in real GDP during prior recessions was attributable to inventory liquidation, which meant cutbacks in production and jobs, and sharp reductions in capital spending. Presently, those conditions don't exist.

Businesses in a wide range of industries outside of the housing sector have nimbly adjusted their production processes, and inventories are very lean. That significantly reduces the potential impact of any slowdown in demand on production and employment. Similarly, firms have constrained investment spending while maintaining high cash balances. Following the capital spending boom of the 1990s, the unwinding of the capital stock, net of depreciation, also lowers the probability of a jarring reduction in business investment spending.

 Fed monetary policy points toward sustained growth in nominal spending. Despite the financial turmoil, credit remains available to basic businesses and the vast majority of households, and a general ""credit crunch"" is highly unlikely to unfold.

Historically, real disposable personal income has been the dominant factor driving consumer spending. As long as businesses maintain employment, and wages continue to rise, reflecting tight labor markets, rising personal income will outweigh the negative impacts of declining home prices, declines in mortgage refinancing, and even the recent increase in energy prices, on consumption.

This assessment presumes that businesses will not cut net jobs. No doubt, jobs will be lost in some industries -- real estate, mortgage brokers and related finance, to name a few. But that's minor in the context of 138 million U.S. workers.

 My discussions with a wide array of business executives in an assortment of non-financial industries suggest that they have not materially altered their hiring plans, despite heightened concerns about general economic conditions. The majority plan to maintain employment levels or increase them in the next year, with most of the planned increases in export and international-related activities. September's reported rise in employment, covering the period of maximum financial crisis, is encouraging.

Once again, turmoil on Wall Street doesn't necessarily translate to contraction on Main Street.

Remember, following both the stock market crash of 1987 (which involved a cumulative 35% decline in equity valuations) and the 1998 financial crisis, the economy continued to expand. In both cases the Fed eased, financial markets absorbed the shock, and the economy proved resilient. The same will unfold this time; recession is not in the cards.

personalfinance,"36 years old, about to start my first ""real"" job. Finally want to get started saving and could use some advice.","Hello folks.

So, short version, my life plan has been a general shambles for the last few decades, but I somehow managed to land a job with a salary higher than I ever expected to make in my life. As such, I can finally (hopefully) stop living hand-to-mouth and hopefully start saving what I can for later. I've read through the wiki, but my late start makes me wonder if some priorities may be somewhat shifted from normal.

I have an outline of a plan, but a bit of advice for some points would be greatly appreciated, as, quite frankly, I've never really had money to spare up to now.  

To date, in total, I have about 1200$ in a retirement account from my days of university teaching. Unemployment has reduced my current savings to under 500$, and my 1000$ limit credit card is nearly maxed out. I also have substantial federal student loan debt (over 100k$), currently frozen.

First and foremost, my new job offers a 401(k) plan, and I intend to contribute the full 6% they offer matching on. Past that, I'm not entirely sure which direction to go. I have a few steps I want to take, but am not entirely sure of the order.

\-Pay off Credit Card

\-Rebuild my savings to cover 3+ months rent/bills

\-Purchase a replacement for my car (It is on its last legs and I need transportation to work. I'm perfectly happy shopping Used, but the market is not great at the moment) 

\-Open an IRA to contribute more towards the future (Roth or Trad, unsure)

\-Finally, hopefully, eventually, start putting some money away towards a House so I can move out of the tiny apartment I've spent the last 12 years in. 

In addition, I may have medical expenses in the \~near future (I've not seen a doctor in quite some time, and I'll finally have decent insurance. Might get my gallstones taken care of? Maybe some dental work? Depends on time-off availability). And, I'm not sure if I should keep my student loans at their current, rather high, repayment rate, or swap to an income-driven plan and just keep kicking the interest down the road. 

My questions for the moment are basically: 

\-Should I open an IRA ASAP, or wait until I have my savings rebuilt? 

\-Similarly, should I wait until I have a new (used) car sorted out before opening the IRA? Every car I've owned up to this point I purchased outright, so I've never dealt with a car payment before, unsure how to weight that decision in my plans.

\-Should I keep my current High (\~750$/mo) student loan payments, or would the Income-Driven plan be more advisable (Great Lakes' calculator suggests the payment would be less than half my current plan, but the interest worries me). Note: payments are slated to start back up in October, with interest restarting at the end of August. 

\-My new insurance includes an option for ""Flexible Spending Account"" contributions that let you pay for medical stuff with pre-tax money. Given it has limited yearly roll-over and won't follow me if I move to another job, I'm unsure how much I should contribute.

\-Is there a better mechanism for putting away money towards housing other than just ""stick it in your savings account"". 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, including stuff I've missed in my ignorance. I'm honestly still gobsmacked at the job I managed to land and how I'll suddenly be making 3x more than I ever have in my life. All a wee bit overwhelming really.

I don't think, contrary to a lot of belief, that BTC is designed to strictly become a decentralized currency to replace USD. I think its best use case is as an asset, like gold was before it, to back the currencies that already exist. The reason economic disparity is so prevalent is the way the Keynesian Economic model works and how it drives inflation, production, price and wages. When you have fiat currencies backed by nothing, there is nothing to stop the unlimited creation of it to solve financial problems. Fiat should always be be backed by some sort of stable or valuable asset to limit the amount it can be inflated.

Is there anybody that somewhat agrees with this? I think that if BTC was only meant to be pushed to topple the US Dollar as the driver of the World's economy, it wouldn't work too well for people that use it as currency, much like the guy who bought Papa John's pizza with it. It would be much more effective and revolutionary if utilized as an asset that backs currency not a currency itself.

The blockchain can easily be used as the world's ledger and peer-to-peer verification effectively cuts out greedy and predatory banks.

If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I can't understand why people want this to be the new Liberty Dollar, which didn't turn out so good.",cryptocurrency,1658991931
personalfinance,"Recent grad, looking for direction on investing and retirement planning","Hey, everyone. I (25M) recently graduated from a professional degree program and have landed a job which nets me more money than I know how to handle at the moment. I'm single with no kids and currently make **\~$95,000/yr**, working 7 on/7 off shifts. In my line of work, there *are* opportunities to pick up shifts or second jobs for the 7 days that I have off. This is something I will look into once I'm a little more practiced - 6 months down the line or so. I currently have **$80k** in **student loans** at a 5% interest rate (interest and payments on hold through at least August due to COVID) as my only debt.

# Financials

* $6k combined Savings/Checking account
* $2k in 401k (contributing 6% pre-tax and 10% after-tax (Roth 401k)
* $5k in Roth IRA (Vanguard VT fund with retirement date of 2060)

# Financial Goals

* Mortgage started within 5-10 years (\~$300,000 in my (low COL) area - expecting to need about 20% down payment). My **credit score** is currently in the mid **730s**.
* Travel: 2 or 3 decent trips per year, with at least one being outside of the country
* Student loans: Paid off within 5 years
* Retirement: Age 65
* Investments: Financial security to allocate \~15% of my paycheck into medium risk investments

# Monthly Expenses

* Rent: $500
* Utilities: \~$100
* Groceries: \~$300
* Gas: $150
* Cable/Internet: $50
* Cell Phone: $48
* Car insurance: $100
* Health Insurance: $142 (Dental and vision included)

**Total: $1390**

&amp;#x200B;

After taxes, necessary expenses, and 401k, this leaves me with somewhere in the ball park of **$3000 in take home per month** to put towards savings, paying off loans, and investing. I intend to max out Roth IRA at $500/mo and (at a minimum) keep contributing 6% to 401k for full employer match, but I was wondering if anyone has any guidance on what to do from here to help me best achieve my goals and if I need to adjust any of my contributions.

Some specifics that I'm unsure of:

* Emergency savings fund. I've heard that 6-9 months of an emergency fund is important. Should I save aggressively until I reach that point and then redistribute my take home pay afterward?
* 401k allocations: I'm still somewhat unclear on the pros and cons of pre-tax and after-tax contributions. Is my distribution of 6% + 10% okay or should I try to structure it differently?
* Student loans: I know that 5% is a pretty hefty interest rate. I would like to get rid of this debt as soon as possible. Should I forget investing for the time being and just contribute all excess take home pay to my loans?
* Investments: Excepting IRA and 401k, I am beyond lost on how to invest or what to invest in. Some guidance in this area would be much appreciated. I'm interested in diversifying my portfolio with low, medium, and high (maybe only after student loans are paid off) risk investments.

To anyone who's read this far, thank you so much. I am somewhat lost, but trying to get my footing. All help is greatly welcomed!",finance,1658994287

Bitcoin,"Powell's 'doves' boost risk assets Bitcoin rises more than 8% above $23,000","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a press conference following the interest rate resolution on Wednesday that it may be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, but the Fed has not yet decided when it will begin to slow the pace of rate hikes. Powell's dovish wording boosted risk assets.

Falling food and energy prices are evidence that inflation peaked in June and July. While all eyes will be on the Fed today, the real show will begin on 10 August when US inflation data is released.

personalfinance,Is it possible to survive the current skyrocketing inflation?,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I ran into a post that says keeping your money in your savings bank account is not effective enough to survive inflation. I decided to check out this info by comparing the interest rate I receive on my savings and the current inflation rate. The difference is massive.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if I want to save money for my future kids and send them to college, and I will open separate savings account for a college fund and put their $100 monthly, I'm not even sure that I could actually pay for my kid's education. Consider the current sharp price rise. Everything is becoming more expensive daily. So, if I save a couple of thousands for my kids' future, I'm afraid they will still have to take a student loan to go to college. Luckily, I don't have kids yet, and not even married. I'm afraid that family life will be way too expensive shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

But, let's leave the family life apart. I also have to live somewhere. I'm 32 y.o. and still share an apartment with my roommate because I can't afford this place alone. I need to buy something eventually, but again the prices are growing, and soon, I'm afraid I can barely afford a cup of coffee with all my savings.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to surf the web for recommendations on saving money for the future and found some good tips. I'm not talking about spending less money right now. I'm talking about investing my savings into something solid. I know it's risky, and I don't wanna lose all my money at once, so I decided to dig for something more or less stable and promising, and I read about investing in gold and precious metals. I wonder why this investment niche is less trendy than crypto because it seems to me that if you invest with a reputable company, like [Goldco](https://goldtrends.net/goldco-reviews/), you can actually make a profit in the long run. It's highly unlikely that the precious metals market will sink.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, investing isn't the only way; there must be others, so I'd love to hear any advice on surviving inflation. Many thanks to anyone willing to share their thoughts.",finance,1659005828

*****

# [Stock futures fall slightly after big Fed rally, Meta shares decline](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures moved lower Thursday after markets staged a major rally in the previous session following another 0.75 percentage point hike from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 47 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures lost 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Meta Platforms dipped 5.9% in premarket trading on the back of disappointing quarterly results, while Ford gained more than 5% after a beat on the top and bottom lines, and as it raised its dividend. Teladoc cratered more than 25% after taking another large goodwill charge.
*****
&gt; The moves come on the heels of a broad-based rally Wednesday after the Fed’s latest monetary policy decision, as investors continued to bet on whether the central bank can halt surging prices without pushing the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; Following the rate hike from the Fed, DoubleLine Capital’s CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime” he believes the central bank is no longer behind the curve on inflation and Powell has regained credibility.
*****
&gt; “This market reaction seems less of a sugar high than the prior two in June and May,” Gundlach said.
*****
&gt; The Dow jumped more than 400 points in the previous session, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 2.6% and 4.06%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All S&amp;P 500 sectors ended the day higher, with communications services posting its best daily performance since April 2020.
*****
&gt; “For the most part, what’s really driving this move is that the economy is still performing okay and it looks like the Fed is probably going to slow the pace of tightening down by the next policy meeting,” said Ed Moya, Oanda’s senior market analyst.
*****
&gt; Investors have grown increasingly concerned in recent months that the central bank’s attempts to tame surging prices would move the economy closer to a recession, if it hasn’t already entered one.
*****
&gt; Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said during a press conference he does not believe the economy has entered a recession.
*****
&gt; “I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession and the reason is there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,” he said.
*****
&gt; Investors looking for further clues into the state of the economy are awaiting a reading on second-quarter GDP slated for Thursday. While two back-to-back negative quarters of growth is viewed by many as a recession, the official definition is more nuanced, taking into account additional factors, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
*****
&gt; Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the economy to have barely expanded last quarter after contracting 1.6% in the first.
*****
&gt; On the earnings front, investors are looking ahead to results from Apple, Amazon, Intel and Roku slated for after the bell.

stocks,Did the market take Powell's recent rate guidance comments wrong (too dovish)?,"With recent coverage on Bloomberg (paywalled, therefore free archive link: https://archive.ph/fmLjF#selection-4293.133-4293.201 )  and many heated discussions online, one has to wonder if the market is overenthusiastic at this point, almost deliberately misinterpreting the signals provided. 

**Powell will still go strong with future rate hikes, his words have not been dovish, but some parts of the market seem to read a more dovish stance into it.**

Background: The current inflation is rooted in a multitude of factors, maybe more by the sheer number than in prior inflationary periods. 

The distortions caused by Covid19 such as homestay, QE, supply chain disruptions, overheating property market, procurement pattern shifts, labour and worker scarcity, stagnant or even decreasing investments in certain commodities (mining, development, exploration), shifted consumption patterns and further micro chain effects in various industry/business categories seem to last longer than anticipated - inflation is not transitionary.

Climate change and Russia's war with Ukraine are additional disruption factors that make a recovery back to low inflation levels more challenging.

Because these inflation drivers have become more intrinsic the Fed won't have any other option than causing a recession. The longer the current (uncertainty) period takes, the more painful the outcome will be. 

The fairy tale of a soft landing might be just a good tool for the purpose of providing hope, because in reality a soft landing won't fix the underlying problems, a hard landing will possibly do a better job.

CryptoCurrency,5 reasons why we are so bad at market prediction.,"Last night was surprising for many people. Feds raised interest rate by 75 point but cryptomarket just kept going up like it was nothing. It was not the first time that it seemed like market is just acting crazy. Ofc there are some people here who know much more than others but overall it seems like nobody knows nothing. 


















But why predicting the market is so difficult? 





















1. Delayed or rushed effect:
Sometimes it takes a while for market to react. 
Other times market response to something even before it becomes reality. Like when market expects something to happen.

















2. Expectation against reality:
Few years back Facebook fined 5 billion dollars by FTC. And share prices surprisingly went up! (By a total of 10 billion!) [Link](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/07/15/134196/facebook-is-actually-richer-thanks-to-news-of-the-ftcs-5-billion-fine/) .why? Because apparently shareholders expected worst! A bad news which is better than anticipated outcome might be an actual good news. 


















3. Long term vs short term effect:
Take federal rate hike. Short term it usually doesn't sit well with the market. But If it actually manages to tame inflation it will benefit the market in long run. And if it causes a recession, market will be doomed. 


















4. Apophenia: 
This fancy term is used to describe human tendency to seek patterns when there is none. 
You see it many times at this same forum. Like people thinking BTC will not dive past certain price because ot ""historically didn't.""

















5. Masking effect:
Sometimes a lesser effects ""hides"" behind a much bigger effect. Think about all of good news we heard while market was crashing. They are still there. But masked behind a much bigger force. For example of recession hits the market I highly doubt anything else gonna have any meaningful effect on the market.  



















Taking all of this, plus things like mentality, invisible players and hidden effects into the account it is not surprising that market is acting unpredictably.
Or as people love to shout it here ""nobody knows shit about fuck.""",cryptocurrency,1659016303

Bitcoin,Non-crypto investments to diversify my Bitcoin position,"Hi all,

I'm unresponsibly long bitcoin (no leverage but a very high % of my small net worth). I'm very confident that Bitcoin will succeed long term but I would like to lower my short-term volatility with some uncorrelated asset class. I think a big recession or interest rate hikes above consensus could negatively impact bitcoin in the short term.

Have you seen any articles/fund strategies/academic papers that study assets uncorrelated with Bitcoin? US Long term treasury bonds are starting to look more appealing now for the first time in a while and could do well in a recession (but probably not if rate hikes are above consensus)

Any other ideas? gold? commodities? value stocks?

stocks,So we are in a recession,"The rationale of most people on twitter and reddit seems to be , recession = cancel rate hikes.

This is like missing the forest for the trees. Recession is a BIG thing. Dare I say bigger than anything that FED can or cannot do. Why? With 9% inflation FED will not do QE to save the economy. Meaning there is no help coming. Rate hike pause in itself won't mean much to get the economy out of recession when interest rates are at 2.5-3%.

personalfinance,Help With a Math Problem With 3 Loans,"Good morning, PF

I have 3 loans right now. The balances are as follows:

~CAD181,000 at 4.7%. This one requires monthly interest payments at minimum, and in August of 2024 will require a monthly minimum of 1% of the total outstanding balance. The interest rate is floating and is contractually Bank of Canada plus 2.2 I think.

~CAD 72,000 at 5.7%. This one does not accrue interest nor require payment until Jan 1st 2023, and at that time will be on a traditional amortization schedule. (The interest begins Jan 1, and the first payment is Jan 31). This is also a floating rate and is contractually the rate on the first loan plus 1%.

~USD27,000 at 4.85% fixed. Car loan, minimum is ~585 dollars. 

Income is USD 275,000 and on august 1st I am due a $40,000 bonus. 

My question is this: The bank holding the 181k has offered to let me take out a further (up to) 17k to help with any of the other loans. Given that the next BoC meeting in a month will likely push that loan's rate higher than the car loan, it doesn't make sense to use it for that. However, the 72k loan will always have a higher interest rate, so it might be worthwhile to take up to 17k and apply it there. But if I did that, I would be paying more interest to the bank that holds the 181 for the few months prior to January when interest starts on the 72, so given the difference is 1%, I wonder if it would be worthwhile and I need help with the math. 

Thanks PF in advance.",finance,1659019515

investing,What kind of inflation is worse and more difficult to control? Supply-side or demand-side?,"I am just trying to understand what kind of inflation we are dealing with these days and whether it's a matter of resolving some external factors to address it.

* Supply-side inflation: there is a dearth of resources/goods/services, and people are willing to pay a higher price for every bit they can get. Rising prices does not stop people from buying and bidding higher, which creates an inflation spiralling out of control. Raising interest rates in such an environment would do little, will it not? Currently, it's the risk of extended war and resurgence in demand after COVID that can contribute to an inflation surge powered by an inability of the global supply chain to meet these demands.

* Demand-side inflation: people have more to spend, because money was available so cheaply. There is lot more debt than can be financed, and once the Feds/central banks raise rates, after some defaults, things go back to ""normal"". Demand adjusts to a level that normalises the prices and inflation kind of just dissipates. People are not buying stuff out of desperation, they just wanted to raise their standard of living.

What kind of inflation are we in? Investing in Supply-side inflation seems kind of profitable for some companies (they can increase prices without damaging revenue) but overall it seems a terrible situation. Demand-side inflation seems more healthy and generally good time to, ""buy the dips"".

Inflation is always presented as this ""invisible evil force"" that is bad and ever-present danger, but inflation is driven by us, the humans. Why do people keep buying at higher and higher prices? And if they are cutting back on their spending...*what is causing prices to spiral higher*? Who is buying at those prices? Are the rich people single-handedly raising inflation, is that even possible?",finance,1659021992
personalfinance,Thoughts on leveraging the rate hikes,"So Capital One is offering a balance transfer of 2% BT fee for 18 months at 0% interest. 2% is the best I've seen in quite a while. BT includes the option of having a check sent to you, with the intention to pay off higher interest debt or bolster savings. Meanwhile, the rate hikes have incrementally ratcheted up the CD rates such that an 18 month CD is paying 2.4% APY.

$5000 at a 2% BT fee is is $100

$5000 invested in an 18 month CD, compounding monthly at 2.4% is ~$180.

A.) Anything fraudulent with using a BT check to invest in a CD?

B.) If it's on the up and up, it's the juice worth the squeeze?

CryptoMarkets,Fed Rates and Crypto Meeting Update,,cryptocurrency,1659028121
CryptoCurrency,Here's why the crypto and stock market seems to believe that all the recent data is actually bullish...or at the very least not bearish enough to go back down.,"Keep in mind how markets work. Whether it's stocks, or crypto.

Markets speculate on future value. Hence the famous phrase ""buy the rumor, sell the news"".

So even if we're in a recession, the market only cares about what's next, not what's happening now.

Also, keep in mind the difference between Wall Street vs Main Street. 

Crypto and stocks are based a little more on speculation, and can seem more irrational, and out of synch with main street.

# GDP:

We are officially in a recession in the US. At least if you go by the simplified definition of 2 consecutive negative GDP.

So markets should go down right?

GDP is actually a lagging metric. It looks back at the last 3 months.

The latest GDP numbers may have shown further evidence of a bottom, and possibly the worst already happening in the past months. Last quarter, GDP was -1.6%. And this quarter that drop has slowed to -0.9%.

If you look at the monthly GDP, we were briefly flirting with -2% GDP (coinciding with peak oil prices), and slowed back to -0.9%.

A negative GDP was pretty much expected already. We already had data for that. So that part should have been priced in. What the market was waiting for, was the extend of the damage, and evidence of the worst being behind us.

# Inflation:

This one keeps getting worse. So why is the market not taking further?

That last figure for CPI wast at 9.1%. A pretty scary figure.

Yet markets went up.

There's many elements to this. But the biggest one is energy.

Energy was by far the biggest culprit of the increased CPI. In fact, energy alone, accounted for the entire increase in CPI, compared to the previous quarter.

That came from having oil prices hitting $122 a barrel in June for that quarter. But OPEC has started a series of increases of output, and oil prices have since dropped below $100. Recently bouncing between $98-$94.

So the main culprit of the much higher CPI, is now going down. Not having the Fed printing stimulus money, does also help.

# Earnings:

Remember last week all the posts saying we would drop, because earnings would miss this week?

Earnings did miss, but stocks and crypto still went up.

A part of it was because everyone was already expecting a miss. If for a couple weeks all you hear is everyone saying earnings will be bad, and it's gonna be a tough week, then chances are, the market already expects this.

But the other thing is, GOOG and MSFT weren't quiet as bad as maybe some people were expecting. Especially putting things into context. They still performed well under strained conditions, and still had some hefty revenue.

# Supply and demand:

This is really the biggest factor. If you run out of enough sellers (maybe because all the people who wanted to panic sell have already panic sold), prices become too oversold or too cheap, demand returns, shorts become too easily squeezed, there's not enough stop losses low enough to dive down, etc...Then the laws of supply and demand will kick in. There's only so far a bearish phase...or an entire bear market can go before it runs out of fuel and selling pressure.

This could be just a bearish phase running out of fuel. Or the entire bear market.

# Crypto outlook:

Crypto could form a bottom and begin to recover before stocks.

Mainly because it's a much faster moving market, more volatile, than stocks. It goes through its bear and bull cycles much faster than the stocks market.

It's more vulnerable to speculation.

We even often see Bitcoin crash, or pump, before stocks. Even when the Fed rate hike was released, Bitcoin reacted half an hour before stocks.

The entire bear market started about 2 months ahead of stocks.

While it has been correlated to stocks this year, that may not last very long. It moves at a different speed, and different volatility. We can already see the statistical correlation beginning to drop.

Is crypto beginning to decouple and return to follow its own cycles?",cryptocurrency,1659029864

I'm married and we have 2 young kids in daycare. We have a house and student loans we're currently paying off, and are about to buy a new car.

I'll start with some basic information. Assets first:

* Savings: Been maintaining $160,000 in our savings for over a year now, so our inflow and outflow of money has been equal. Daycare put a serious damper on our savings rate.
* Income: $140,000 / year combined

The thing is, the FED is an US organisation. Same as the SEC. But Crypto is a decentralized system, and most of the crypto actors (would it be coin creators, exchanges, or even crypto owners) are not US based.

I'm currently behind on retirement saving as I spent most of my 20's making little money + other not-so-great financial decisions.

Now for the details:

* **Single, 28M, also great credit if that matters (800+)**
* **Income/Savings/Capital**:

* **Student Loans**
   * *Private Student Loans*: $27k @ 2.91% - ($300/mo minimum payment)
   * *Federal Student Loans*: $29k @ varying interest rates (all higher than private loans)
      * I work in City Government (Parks &amp; Rec), so hopefully....PSLF
* **Other Debt**:
   * *Auto Loan*: $2,000 @ 10% APR (I know, terrible), $150/mo
   * *No cc debt* \- (I've never owned a credit card)
   * *No mortgage* \- (I rent)
* **Retirement/Investing**:
   * $8.5k in a 401k from my last job, have not yet rolled over to a Traditional IRA
   * $1,200 from my previous pension they still need to send me
   * $600 in an S&amp;P 500 investment account through Betterment
   * $500 in a Roth IRA which I just created last month after starting my new job.
   * Pension = 1.8% of Final Average Compensation x Years of Service - (again, I'm ignoring this)
      * *^(Did not start truly saving for retirement until age 27. I had a government job from ages 24-27 and naively thought ""I don't need to worry about contributing to an IRA, I have my pension."" I left the job after 3 years (before being vested)* *and have very little to show for it. Lesson learned the hard way. I'll be ignoring my pension this time around.)*

I've been throwing an extra $700 per month toward my private loans since the beginning of this year. Currently, I invest $450 per month into my Roth IRA (but will also need to open up a Traditional IRA to roll my 401k savings into).

But I'm wondering now, considering the importance of time in the market, if that's a mistake (given the low interest rate of my private loan), and if I would be better off investing that extra money. Initially I'd planned to invest some, while throwing extra money at my student loans until their paid off. Should I reverse this thinking? Make minimum payments on the loans, and invest more heavily?

I'm trying to weigh Investing vs. Debt. vs. House savings, but I'm not sure where to begin.

stocks,Nasdaq Soars to 5000 as Tech Stock Optimism Continues,"**By Greg Ip Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal**

March 10, 2000 1:42 am ET

Knocking aside valuation, interest-rate and psychological barriers like tenpins, the Nasdaq Composite Index rolled through the 5000 mark.

It is a crowning milestone in investors' unprecedented love affair with technology stocks.

The Nasdaq first tested the 5000 mark two days ago, but failed to close above it. Thursday, the Nasdaq used a late-day burst to finish up 149.60 points, or 3.05%, to 5046.86, a little more than two months after first crossing 4000. The index reached the achievement on the strength of Nasdaq stalwarts such as Microsoft , which rose $4.4375 to an even $100, returning its market value above the $500 billion mark, and market newcomers like VeriSign which climbed $37.75 to $240.75. Volume on the Nasdaq reached 1.9 billion shares, a typical level for today's markets but almost double last year's average.

The Nasdaq composite has defied almost all expectations by coming off last year's historic 86% gain with an even stronger start this year. It is up 24% so far this year -- that is already just under the full-year gain in 1999 for the Dow, of 25%. By contrast, the Dow is down 12.9% so far this year and the S&amp;P 500 is down 4.6%.

The Nasdaq has accomplished all this without depending on a handful of stalwarts. At a time when most other stocks, including most of the blue chips, are down sharply from their highs, 61% of Nasdaq's stocks are up so far this year and 39% down, according to Ned Davis Research.

A glance at Nasdaq's biggest market value gainers from 4000 to 5000 (which are therefore the biggest contributors to the composite, which is market-value weighted) shows the rotation in the ranks. They include Intel , up 41% to $395 billion; Juniper Networks , up 150% to $43 billion; and PMC-Sierra Inc., up 230% to $33 billion. None were among the top 10 contributors to the Nasdaq's move from 3000 to 4000.

The biggest threat for the rampaging technology market -- despite investor sentiment to the contrary -- is the continued threat that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Historically, tech stocks have fallen harder than the overall market at times of rising interest rates because of the discounting impact on the present value of their future profits. But that historic rule has been turned on its head this year as almost every other sector went down as scripted as the Fed raised rates but technology climbed to new highs.

The new logic is that rising rates don't affect technology companies because they don't borrow and because their sales growth is enough to overcome any interest rate impact. Indeed, Mr. Olesky said that as the end of the first quarter approaches, Nasdaq could coast to more highs as money managers rotate further into the best-performing stocks.

personalfinance,Funds to finish my degree,"Hello,

I am a 33-year-old that works full time and has a mortgage. My finances are in order where I could pay for a few semesters of classes, but I rather take out a loan and deal with it as I wouldn’t be able to cover all of it. I need roughly $25,000 to finish my BS in Computer Science.

Other than marching down to my wife’s credit union or my bank, are there any other good options for me? My place of work only reimburses degrees that are within the medical field as I work at a hospital but within IT.

personalfinance,HELOC or refinance to pay off debt,"Hello all! We're drowning in debt and have been in our home for 7 years paying $1662.63 a month, and now have 41.64% LTV (value is approx $479k and payoff balance is $193k) with an interest rate of 3.75%. 

If I add up all our credit card debt, it's a whopping $102k with interest rates between 6.24% to a staggering 26.74%. Each month, we pay the minimums,  $2,545.96 a month. 

This doesn't include our student loan debt from federal and private lenders, at roughly $250k total, give or take. Monthly is roughly $1,282. 

We're drowning and considering either a refinance, HELOC, or second mortgage. Our credit isn't the greatest because of the debt to income ratio but we make all payments on time and always have. I'm not especially good with numbers or calculating interest and up until now have been irresponsible with debt. 

We would ideally like to use our equity and pay off all debt. It would be nice to also have some money for a few home improvements. We aren't concerned about losing our jobs, and don't feel at risk for a reduction in income, so there's stability. Interest rates are higher now than when we purchased and hate to lose that 3.75% but I can't help but feel this is worth it and will greatly change our financial situation. 

In this scenario, would you use HELOC or refinance? Why or why not?",finance,1659039378

inflation,Unorthodox Inflation,"Hi (first post on Reddit), I'm looking the get some perspective into the actual working on inflation as I'm unsure how well I believe orthodox economics - particularly with the current situation in Türkiye. Below I have posted some thoughts I have on the workings of inflation and government reaction to it. If this subreddit isn't the best for me could you please direct me to where I would be better asking?   
Anyway, I've split this post into two 1 for traditional economic reaction to inflation and 2 for why I would guess untraditional methods could work. 

  

**1)Thatcherism**

Try to keep inflation rates low and also keep interest rates low. (about 2%)

Assume 2 categories of people:

\- DSU (deficit spending units) those who live month to month

\- SSU (surplus spending units) those who spend less than they earn

Any given month a DSU may spend more than they earn due to unexpected costs (car failure etc.), since they need money for this they chose to take a loan out. This loan has a lower interest and appears to be affordable over given months. 

In the same month a SSU will have money left over at the end of the month. Since the interest rates are low they choose to invest the money in a company rather than at a bank. 

This combination of increased spending and investment makes the company feel more financially secure. Since the company is more financially secure they are able to loan more money at a cheaper rate. Since the rate is cheaper the government can then afford to borrow money from these companies and these companies. Hence, the increased government debt that has happened. 

So essentially low inflation means that people are spending money and investing more in the economy which in turn makes companies more stable and therefore allows the government to borrow more money. (increased taxation with more steps?  Increase tax and the government will make more money – keep inflation rates low and the government makes more money) 

Pros: 

\- gives SSUs an opportunity to grow wealth

\- increased corporate wealth which gives companies more control over public affairs/takes away the risk of a government corruption 

\- consistent value of currency is good for a balanced economy of imports and exports (perhaps overvalued currency) 

Cons: 

\- Since SSUs are growing wealth and DSUs are not, the wealth inequality increases (wealth inequality can lead to revolutions – regardless of how well off the SSU category) 

\- Corruption in government officials who may have money invested (agency problem)

\- Are companies trying to improve society or make themselves rich?

\- SLOW GROWTH during periods of rising inflation

Since this is the proposed only way to a successful economy, all measures must be taken to ensure this stays true and that is why when inflation appears to be rising the interest rates must also rise – letting spending slow down and therefore inflation (by the laws of supply and demand)

  

**2)Alternative** 

When inflation rises do not increase interest rates. 

Problems with this are that there is a fear of hyperinflation, and that common people will not be able to afford things without increasing the wage. Therefore, government intervention would be needed to ensure that wages are increased with inflation to counter the latter problem. As for the fear of hyperinflation, proposed inflation band – similar to exchange rate bands (which most ‘floating’ currencies have)

Therefore, left with a moderately high inflation as well as a low interest rate. 

Pros: 

\- Increased spending (nobody wants to lose their value for money) – economy booms

\- Wealth inequality will decrease as the rich are losing more money than the poor are losing with the time value of money 

\- Less government intervention is needed on monetary policy 

\- decreases value of currency (con) which may come with a lag and create an undervalued currency – undervalued currencies increase profits on exports while also increasing costs of imports. Also, foreign investors would be attracted to invest in undervalued currencies if they speculate that the valuation will fix itself as this means they are profiting off both the investment itself and the difference in currency valuation.  

Cons: 

\- Companies are less secure as they also need to keep spending (however company spending may help day-to-day life) 

\- Less money for the government to borrow (could be a pro for great deficits) and thus if money is needed then taxation must be increased (personally think taxation is good if the government can be trusted to spend it in the most beneficial way – OBVIOUSLY NOT ALWAYS THE CASE) 

\- More government intervention on other policies (minimum wage)

\- BIG CON (maybe pro at the end) – if people struggle to save how do they deal with ambitions to buy a home etc (further government intervention would be needed on issues such as this). However, fewer people buying homes would decrease demand for home ownership and cause them to drop in value. If homes go down in value then the cost of rent would presumably go down in value as well and as it all goes – less spending on essentials, more spending on expendables, increase in company profits, etc. etc. etc……

CryptoCurrency,Is the US economy now in recession? Poll and opinions.,"According to the Guardian:

&gt;For  many, the unofficial rule of thumb is that a recession has started  after two consecutive quarters of economic contraction measured by a  fall in gross domestic product (GDP).  
&gt;  
&gt;So that's it? Not  so fast. Officially, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) – a  non-profit group of economists – defines when the US is in a recession.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  NBER looks at GDP but also at employment figures, personal income,  industrial production and other factors. It defines a recession as “a  significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the  economy and lasts more than a few months”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Federal  Reserve and administration officials would also prefer the public not  to think of a recession as defined purely by GDP – and presumably not to  think about it at all – so they are stressing that the picture is more  complicated.  
&gt;  
&gt;Are they right? Yes and no. The unemployment rate is 3.6%, near a  half-century low. Wages are also rising, although not as quickly as  inflation, and 2.7 million people were hired in the first half of the year.

At least want to know what the crypto community largely thinks of this fundamental question. So:

They sent me home with new special wet food instead of my orjen dry food. It's been just under 4 hours and he's drank alot of water and peed multiple times but he hasn't eaten since. He's also very sleepy still but he can stand and walk and he played with me for about 10 minutes.

To curb inflation, central banks raise the cost of money, triggering a slowdown in the economy and driving down prices.However, the other condition is just slowing down and requires the opposite treatment.

This was never disclosed until I called them asking why 1 cent was being held from the available balance. It wasn't mentioned in the account documents either. Come to think of it, minimums weren't mentioned for *any* regular accounts in documents or otherwise. I understand there are minimums for credit union savings accounts for the membership share and am fine with that, but even that wasn't mentioned in the documents.

Does anyone else have this? It seems kind of consumer-unfriendly, especially for a credit union, for a 1 cent withdrawal of your own money to cause an overdraft. I understand that banks don't want long-term $0 balance accounts and reserve the right to close them, but this seems downright petty.

Also, small pet peeve. It gets annoying to see the available and current balance constantly off by 1 cent. Makes me think I miscalculated something.

stocks,FOMO is the Mindkiller,"Over the past week was big in business news since there were key tech earnings, FED meeting, consumer confidence report and GDP. Overall the news wasn’t that good for the sign of the economy and yet the unexpected happened in the market. Most stocks were up and had very very high gains. Just a month ago everyone was fearing how a recession was imminent and get ready when the FED raised interest rates at a historic level and here we are again with more bitter news. Earnings overall weren’t that good, higher interest rates, more government spending and most likely inflation to stay relatively high. I was debating putting a big chunk of deposits after the interest rates last month and now that I look back, I probably could made a significant chunk but that’s no different than FOMO creeping on me and trying to time the market.

Not to be a doomer but I still see the market to be relatively bearish. I don’t know how a recession would pan out today vs the one two years ago or in 2008 but the sentiment now seems to be everything is priced in and is not as bad as we thought it might would and I see this more around the subreddit.  Do I know exactly how it will pan out? No I don’t but it’s the fact the sentiment changed that quickly in matter of less than a month. The next big set of news coming is up the inflation report (CPI) August 10th for July. If inflation is still remaining high at 9% it could mean more interest rate hikes by taking more drastic measures. Point being there’s still a lot of macro effects (inflation, highest debt, rising unemployment, loans, etc...) that signal the economy still isn’t strong. Also anyone in Europe with the looming energy crisis isn’t a good sign either and further conflict with Taiwan/China with potential visits that can further the trade war. Lastly during Bearish/recessionisk times, there are some of the highest gains in the stock market (dead cat bounces) and that doesn’t necessarily mean you should FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) in because it went up significantly over a short period.

solar,ProjectSolar Proposal,"I’m in DFW and considering getting a system through ProjectSolar, installed by TriSmart.

Here is the proposal which seems pretty reasonable based on other quotes I’ve seen. I’d love any thoughts.

Installer: TriSmart
Install Warranty Length: 25 Years
System Size: 11.1kW
Panel Type: Silfab 370W HC
Inverters: Enphase IQ 7+
Panel Warranties: 30 Year Production/25 Year Equipment
Full Installation: $25,461.18
Full Installation (After Federal Incentives): $18,841.27

We aren’t serviced by Oncor (Tri County Coop) so no additional incentives there.

This actually puts us at 121% offset. Our home was just under 3100 sq feet but was built in 2020 so it’s pretty energy efficient.

Should I lower the system size? We might add a pool at some point so that obviously will drive up usage.

Honestly my biggest worry is hail storms. Anyone from DFW have any horror stories about hail?",energy,1659078893
personalfinance,Is having a paypal balance/card worth it?,"Hi, so I have a checking account and a savings account with a credit union. I get large refund (financial aid) checks and I'm not sure whether to place it in a checking account or savings or maybe ask them to not send me them. I don't spend too much as I get fed living at home with parents, I usually buy food when they are gone and the groceries here are depleted, when I don't like what they've made or when I am not home(campus cafeteria during school hours or shops nearby). My other second biggest expense has been buying clothes. I have placed most of the pell grant checks in my checking account and I had a covid emergency check in my savings. I'm wanting to find a way to separate my personal expenses unrelated to school so I can learn to manage my money but since I do a lot of online shopping as compared to using cash in person, I need to often use a debit card when buying anything online. The problem is debit cards are linked to checking. I want to actually save some of what I've made so far from a few babysitting gigs yet also use those savings on personal expenses. I also worry about it seeming like I am spending too much financial aid inappropriate. I'm thinking to try to get paypal balance-debit card? Will this card link to my regular checking account or can I just leave whatever is sent to paypal to my balance? I use surveyjunkie and just click accept payment when it arrives. Are there fees that might make paypal cards not worth to get at all? Thanks in advance, I hope I was able to communicate my concerns well!",finance,1659081581
stocks,The Fed vowed to crush inflation with higher rates. Then the stock market rallied. Here’s why. (It’s not good news)- Interesting read,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points despite acknowledging that economic growth is clearly slowing. The central bank, under Powell, reiterated that the path of least resistance is well-represented by the so-called dot plot: More hikes ahead — all the way to a fed funds rate of 3.75%!

And yet, the stock market has staged a humongous rally, led by the most valuation-sensitive and risk-sentiment-driven asset classes: Nasdaq stocks **COMP,** **+1.08%** and crypto.

**So … what the heck?!**

It all boils down to how one single sentence was able to affect the probability distributions that investors were projecting for different asset classes.  
Does it sound complicated? Bear with me: it’s not!

**Why did stocks rally?**

When the FOMC’s press release was published, it looked like business as usual: A well-telegraphed 75-bp hike with the only small surprise represented by an unanimous vote despite clear acknowledgment that economic growth is softening.

But not even 15 minutes into the press conference, the fireworks went off!  
In particular, when Powell said: ‘‘We are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of neutral interest rates, and after front-loading our hiking cycle until now we will be much more data-dependent going forward.’’

 **This is very important for several reasons-**

The neutral rate is the prevailing rate at which the economy delivers its potential GDP growth rate — without overheating or excessively cooling down. With this 75-bp hike, Powell told us the Fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate and, hence, from here they aren’t contributing to economic overheating anymore. But that also means any further increases are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. And the bond market knows that every time the Fed became restrictive in the past, they ended up breaking something.

Until Wednesday, you could be completely sure that the Fed would have just pressed on the accelerator — inflation must come down; no space for nuance. So journalists asked questions to find out something about the ‘‘new’’ forward guidance. It went roughly like this:

Journalist: ‘‘Mr. Powell, the bond market is pricing you to cut rates starting in early 2023 already. What are your comments?’’

Powell: ‘‘Hard to predict rates six months from now. We will be fully data-dependent.’’

Journalist: ‘‘Mr. Powell, due to the recent bond and equity market rally, financial conditions have eased quite a lot. What’s your take?’’

Powell: ‘‘The appropriate level of financial conditions will be reflected in the economy with a lag, and it’s hard to predict. We will be fully data dependent.’’ 

He did it. He totally ditched forward guidance. And what happens when you do so? You give markets the green light to freely design their probability distributions across all asset classes without any anchor — and that explains the gigantic risk rally — as well as the jump in the broader S&amp;P 500 SPX, +1.21%.

**Let’s see why-**

If the Fed is so data-dependent, and there is basically one data they care about, it all boils down to how inflation will evolve in the near future — and the bond market has a very strong opinion about that. Using CPI inflation swaps, I calculated the one-year forward, one-year inflation break-evens — basically, the expected inflation between July 2023 and July 2024, which is represented in the chart above and sits at 2.9%. Remember that the Fed targets (core) PCE, which tends to historically be 30-40 bps below (core) CPI: Essentially, the bond market expects inflation to slow very aggressively and roughly hit the Fed’s target in the second half of 2023 already!

So if the Fed is not nearly on autopilot anymore, and markets have a strong opinion on inflation and growth collapsing, then they can also price all other asset classes around this base case scenario. It starts to be more clear now, right? This is what my Volatility Adjusted Market Dashboard (VAMD — here’s a short explainer) showed soon after Powell enunciated that one single sentence.

You have $200k  in crypto on a platform like Voyager.

You are receiving interest on the coins every month

Some portion of the portfolio is used to execute short-term trades based on crypto volatility.  In doing so, you accrue gains from buying/selling.

Voyager announces that they've suspended trading and have restricted your access to assets.  You are not able to do anything with crypto or money for the remainder of the taxable year as Voyager restructures.  They were (are) able to do this because their terms of service stipulate that you are pledging any assets you transfer to their platform.

Let's assume the investor's gains for that year (from trading + interest) are near 10k

For the remainder of the  year, the investor doesn't have access to either the principal or the gains. 

What options does this person have when filing federal taxes for that tax year understanding that they will most likely only receive a fraction of their assets back when the dust settles (though that's not know at the time of filing)?

stocks,(7/29) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of this week and for this month of July. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-

*****

#[S&amp;P 500 futures gain after strong Apple, Amazon reports as index heads for best month since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/stock-market-news-updates-open-to-close-future.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Friday as Wall Street looked to finish the week and the month higher.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.7%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added 1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 66 points, or 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was set to post strong weekly gains. The Dow is now up nearly 2% for the week, while the S&amp;P 500 the Nasdaq Composite are up 2.8%.
*****
&gt; The major averages were also on pace for their best month of 2022. The Dow is on track for a more than 5% gain for July, while the S&amp;P 500 could finish higher by 7.5%. The Nasdaq Composite, while still in bear market territory, is up more than 10% for the month.
*****
&gt; That performance is a stark contrast from the previous six months when stocks tumbled to their June bear market. The market reversed as investors fears about the aggressive pacing of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases started to wane and the idea that inflation has peaked began to settle in.
*****
&gt; Futures Thursday were supported by gains from two of the market’s biggest stocks. Amazon shares popped 12% after the e-commerce giant reported stronger-than-expected sales for the previous quarter, while Apple climbed 2.6% after posting better-than-expected iPhone revenue.
*****
&gt; Chevron and Exxon Mobil also posted better-than-expected results for the previous quarter, sending their shares higher.
*****
&gt; However, the latest batch of corporate results has been mixed.
*****
&gt; Shares of Roku sank more than 20% after the company missed estimates and warned of a slowdown in advertising. Chipmaker Intel dropped 7% after its quarterly results fell short of expectations.
*****
&gt; These moves come after a three-quarters of a percentage point hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a negative GDP reading on Thursday.
*****
&gt; “The market is taking on a hope that slowing economic growth is going to result in a more dovish Fed moving forward, even if it’s a little further out. So it would make sense to me that weaker rates expectations moving forward would result in a little buoyancy in the equity markets,” said Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist of New York Life Investments.
*****
&gt; However, Goodwin cautioned that the unusual economic environment and the long period before the next Fed meeting make it difficult to predict the central bank’s path from here.
*****
&gt; Investors will get updated looks at a key inflation reading and second-quarter employment costs on Friday, which could be key data points for the Fed as it considers its next move.

gaming,Please help me remember the name of this game from the 90s.,"I was thinking about this old game I used to play with my buddy back in the 90s. I think it was a DOS game.

It was vaguely similar to chess, with two sides and you had a number of points to buy creatures to form your army. I believe the goal was to kill the enemy orb holder to win, but you couldn't tell who had it.

You would move the units one by one and when they encountered each other it would enter into a top down real time one on one battle. 

I think the easiest way to narrow it down the specific game is to describe some of the units.


Vampire Bat could stun and healtdrain (brokenly OP in players hands)

Water/Fire Elementals. Both shot bolts and the water guy would do a crashing wave charge, fire guy would flare up and make a fire nova

Demon, big, red, blew a cone of fire.

Gladiator looking guy with a sword

Orc with arm blades

Wraith - could teleport around the map, even really far away at the cost of health. Lifedrained in combat

Grey robed woman with a staff, I think she was called a Seer and could see invisible units.

I was thinking it was an SSI game but I looked through their released titles and none of the name clicked.

Anyone know what I am talking about here?",technology,1659098757

personalfinance,Having a small windfall coming my way and need help with finances!,"I figured I would stop here first and possibly consider getting the services of a financial planner.

I was a late bloomer and went to college in my mid-to-late 20s and racked up a ton of debt.

I've been out of college for a few years now and been working steady and my financial situation has changed greatly in the last year.

I'm now making ~$70,000 / year and within the next month or two, I will be receiving a bonus of $25,000 and then in another six months, I will be receiving a second bonus of $25,000.

I calculated this out and after taxes, this is going to come out to ~$16-17k after taxes.

I've taken a look at my finances and here is what I'm currently sitting at:

Private Student Loan w/ Co-signer -- 8.25% APR -- $6800 remaining

Private Student Loan w/ Co-signer -- 9.99% APR -- $45000 remaining

Public Student Loans (No Co-signer) -- 0% APR -- $60600 remaining

PLOC -- 8.25% APR -- $9000 / $10000 Limit

Discover Card -- 25% APR -- $9000 / $15000 Limit

Store Card -- 25% APR -- $0 Balance / $2000 Limit

Bank CC -- 16% APR -- $200 Balance / $2800 Limit

Car Loan -- $900 Remaining

Medical Debt in Collections (~$2000 in small increments)

Current FICO score: Nearing 700

Basically, I've got a mostly decent history of making payments on time but I'm just crap at budgeting for unexpected expenses. 

At the beginning of the year, I was only making $50k and I negotiated with my employer for a raise (as this was my first employer out of college, I either wanted a big raise or I was going to go elsewhere to get a large raise). For the last couple of months, now that I have extra cash, I've been working on putting all of my extra money toward paying down credit cards first as that's where I'm getting killed on interest rates.

Goals:

Pay down revolving credit / outstanding debt asap

Kick off co-signers on joint accounts to improve their financial situations / credit scores

The Plan:

When I get the first $16k, I would like to start by paying down and $0 out all credit carb balances. I've got no problem avoiding spending money on those cards. Almost all the expenses on the cards have been for various emergencies. Example being, I had my Discover card down to $6k earlier in the year but ended up needing to toss on $3000 in emergency repairs. 

Once they're all at 0, that's going to be a lot of extra money per month I'm not pissing away in interest.

I next want to tackle my smaller Student Loan that is co-signed as well as the medical debt.

Total, this will take up the entire first set of bonus money, but I'm looking forward to moving forward, not having to pay

$350 / mo on student loan

$200 / mo on interest charges on credit cards

And then when my car is paid off in the next two months

$250 / mo in car payments

So that is going to mean I'm going to end up with an extra $800 - $1000 / month to start shifting into other things.

I'm thinking the next course of action will be:

PLOC &gt; 10% Interest Student Loan &gt; Federal 0% Loans

The PLOC I want to get paid off as it's Co-Signed but being the interest rate on that is only 9.75% compared to my credit cards, it seems like I should use that in case of having an emergency expenditure.

So, here is where I have some questions.

1-Do I keep the other cards open so I have a very low balance on high revolving credit offering?

2-Do I take the remainder of the second $16k and just toss is at Student Loans or tuck it away in case of emergencies?

3-What are the chances I can get the 9.99% interest rate Student Loan refinanced and have my cosigner kicked off? As of right now, I've been unable to refinance these loans without a co-signer at all which has been greatly disappointing considering the length of time I've been paying the student loans down without a missed payment. :(

4-How badly will my credit score take a hit if I cancel the high APR Discover and Store CC? Would it be best to try and negotiate a lower APR or cancel the accounts and get accounts with a lower APR?",finance,1659099336

stocks,Is unemployment rate a lagging indicator?,"Let me start by saying I am in no way a finance major. I only do a bit of research in my spare time and am fairly new to this world. 

The other day I stumbled on philips curve which implies that inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship. Right now we have high inflation and low unemployment. 

Now the feds could only talk about how we are not in a recession right now even though we have had two negative gdp quarters in a row because of the low unemployment. At the same time they want to combat the high inflation.

From what I’ve found, the rate hike effects won’t fully be felt for a year. Is the low unemployment rate we have now a lagging indicator from our 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP and the rate hikes? Will unemployment rates rise only after the economic effects of high inflation and rate hikes are fully realized? 

Not looking for a real answer as much as just want to pick other peoples brains as a discussion. None of my real life friends are into this stuff.",finance,1659101457

personalfinance,Advice on Debt Repayment,"Looking for advice - I have a considerable amount of CC debt ($38k) and am recently married and wanting to join finances with my husband, who is very financially responsible. Looking to get some advice on the most reasonable/effective way to pay down this debt with the least impact on him and to get me on track. 

**Here is the breakdown of the debt:**

* CC#1 - $3400 - 0% interest rate until June 2023 (balance transfer)
* CC#2 - $4400  - 0% interest rate until June 2023 (balance transfer)
* CC#3 - $5200 - 20.99% interest rate
* CC#4 - $6300 - 20.99% interest rate
* Personal Loan - $19441 - 15.49% interest rate (no penalty for early repayment)... I applied for a personal loan to cover the whole debt, but could only be approved for \~half and at an unfavorable rate (but still better than the CC Debt I paid off with it)

**Option 1:** 

Drain the Roth IRA I have ($21k – all earnings) and eat the taxes &amp; fees.. this is an account aside from my company 401k, and I have not put any money into it for a number of years. Use that to pay off the credit card debt, and then aggressively pay down the loan. 

**Option 2:** 

Have husband cosign on a loan to consolidate all debt at lower rate, pay as aggressively as possible. 

**Option 3:** 

Pay down the 0% interest cards by February 2023 (while paying min. payments for the rest of the debt), then transfer balance of the other two using a new balance transfer offer. Pay as aggressively as possible until it’s paid off, then pay down the loan as aggressively as possible. 

Do any of these options feel feasible? Once this is paid off and behind me, he will be managing my finances completely, so I am certain that i will not find myself in this position again, just looking to work my way out of it.",finance,1659101830

**FBI uncovers Chinese and Huawei misdeeds**  
Since at least 2017, federal officials have been investigating Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, and pursuing what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.  Among the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons. In addition a proposed $100 million ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC included a pagoda, which investigators noted would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection.

**Google fires software engineer who claimed AI chatbot was ‘sentient’**  
Last month, as we reported, Google put a senior software engineer, Blake Lemoine, on paid administrative leave after he published a paper claiming that the company’s controversial artificial intelligence (AI) model, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) had become ‘sentient’ and was a self-aware person. On Friday, Google publicly announced that it has now fired Lemoine for “violating the company’s confidentiality policy”. It highlighted that the engineer’s claims were “wholly unfounded” and that the company worked with him for “many months” to clarify this. Lemoine had posted an article on Medium in which he stated his conversations with LaMDA revealed the bot’s desire for rights and personhood as well as its fear of death from being shut down.

**Quantum cybersecurity bill heads to the Senate**  
Earlier this month, the bipartisan Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act passed the US House. The bill mandates that the Office of Management and Budget supervise the migration process of federal agencies to post-quantum cryptography. OBM would work off of NIST’s recommended  post-quantum cryptography standards, and keep Congress informed of progress, as well any new risks and need for additional funding. The bill now heads to the Senate. It received support from Google, IBM, and other tech companies working in the nascent quantum computing field.

**Windows adds brute force defense**  
Windows updated the defaults on Windows 11 Insider Preview builds to lock accounts for 10 minutes after 10 sign-in attempts. Vice president for OS security David Weston said this is meant to mitigated Remote Desktop Protocol and other brute-force password vectors. Microsoft does warn that this change may result in denial-of-service attacks on open RDP ports. If this setting sounds great to you, you can already use it in Windows 10, it’s just not on by default.

**Poor training and communications hindering cybersecurity efforts**  
A new report from Tessian indicates that three in four companies in the UK and US experienced a security incident in the last year. The report highlights that employees don’t understand their role in protecting the company, with nearly half (45%) of workers indicating they didn’t know who to report a security incident to, and 30% believing they had no role in helping with cybersecurity. While 85% of employees participate in security awareness programs, almost two-thirds (64%) don’t pay full attention during the training and over a third (36%) consider the security training boring. Additionally, mismanaged anti-phishing exercises are an issue for half of employees, who said they have had negative experiences with phishing simulations.

**Malware volumes increase for first time in three years**  
A new report from SonicWall indicates that malware attacks surged by 11% across the globe in the first half of 2022. The 2.8 billion malware attacks detected during the period represents the first recorded growth in global malware volumes in three years. SonicWall also detected a whopping 45% increase in never-before seen malware variants. There was also a 132% increase in encrypted threats designed to evade detection and 77% increase in threats targeting IoT systems. SonicWall CEO and president, Bill Conner, said “With so much turmoil in the geopolitical landscape, cybercrime is increasingly becoming more sophisticated and varying in the threats, tools, targets and locations.”

CryptoCurrency,"If I had a Moon for every time there's a promise of a doomsday event that turns out to be a nothing burger, I'd have an even more ridiculous amount of Moons.","Seems like every month there's some scary rumor about some upcoming bad news, some big wallet about to dump, something happening with China, some regulation, or something that's about to doom the crypto market, and send us into a collapse. 

Then a week later, we go on a rally.

# The whale wallets dumping:

Remember those posts that promised a big crash or major dip, from a whale wallet that was supposedly about to dump a massive amount of coins?

The most recent ones are these:

&amp;#x200B;

[22K BTC about to dump on the market!](https://preview.redd.it/tbuiunzczie91.jpg?width=824&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0f6a618e7bb862b6d76387ac409d2ef6e72da3e)

It's good to know these things, and it was nice of OP to inform us about this. But here's what really happened the following days:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yl8vtk6lzie91.jpg?width=1866&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=576d1f557b056af1cda1f180be6cd29e7a90bd36

Again, no dumping happened. And a nice redditor explained what happened:

[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w3mn8k/whale\_3\_is\_tricking\_everyone/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w3mn8k/whale_3_is_tricking_everyone/)

&amp;#x200B;

And another one...

Again, no price collapse.

&amp;#x200B;

# The ""brutal"" week:

The latest one was this  week, where we were promised the ultimate bear bomb, with the perfect storm of FUD (remember FUD doesn't mean fake, it means something that causes fear/uncertainty/doubt in a market) with Fed rates, CPI, GDP, and earnings. All expected to be bad. And for the most part, they were pretty bad.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0fimv46f4je91.jpg?width=843&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a04fef7cd57ed93bed70ffe9e5a2502a4637c77

But we didn't get the crash or bloodbath that was promised, we had a very nice pump.

&amp;#x200B;

# China:

There's a ton of classics we get almost every months. The one we probably get the most is China. Whether it's a ban, or some real estate mega company collapsing.

Remember when the ban on Bitcoin mining took effect in June 2021, and the hash rate began to drop that month? By the end of June, Bitcoin was beginning to have a significant drop in hash.

We were told it would be followed by a dramatic crash as the hash rate became low. Instead, the market went up from around $35K to $52K.

But we never know, maybe the next FUD news about China's economy collapsing might actually come true.

&amp;#x200B;

# What has come true:

This is not to say that all FUD doesn't come true. Obviously, some have over the years.

It might actually be shorter to list what doomsday scenarios have actual nearly killed the market, than list everything that hasn't come true.

Outside of just the cyclical bear markets, we've had a few doomsday events that rocked the entire crypto market.

For me, the 3 biggest doomsday FUD scenarios that I really felt nearly killed the market, are the collapse of Mt Gox, the Hash Wars, and the collapse of Luna and UST.",cryptocurrency,1659110803

Both well maintained and don't plan on replacing either anytime soon. Both clear from student loan debt. She has a spotty credit history but mine is excellent.

Additionally, savings account is just fine. I don't need to sell this home to put down a healthy down payment on a new home wherever we end up.  

With a new job I'll have the ability to work remotely so we're going to take that opportunity to move closer to our families. 

**Current home:** Single Family, 2 bd 1.5 bath, attached single car garage, built in 2008, 1200 sqft, small yard, nice quiet area, no HOA. HVAC and hot water heater both just replaced in recent years. If we rent I'll probably replace roof.

**Monthly Payment:**	$900

**Interest Rate:**		5.25%

**Sell Estimate:** $290K - $330K

**Rent Estimate:** $1900/mo - $2400/mo

personalfinance,My first experiences with Ally Bank,"Ok, so I've been with the same bank (USAA) for a zillion years, and decided to leave them, for several reasons. (Probably worthy of a different post, but they've really gone downhill on the insurance side in recent years, and have never been superstars on the banking side, imo ... I used to be a USAA fanboi of epic proportions because of how awesome they were on the insurance side, but man...).

So anyway, I've been with Ally for only a month, thought I would post this before I forget the start up pain, so others know what to expect:

First, the good:

1. It's easy to open an account, set up where you want money moved from.
2. Their interest rates for savings are solid, and seem to keep pace: I don't know if this is common/typical (can't imagine it is, tbh), but in a month, my rates on savings have gone from 1%=&gt;1.1%=&gt;1.25%=&gt;1.4%. (And just for comparison, USAA has been 0.01% for as long as I can remember, so in the same month have been 0.01%=&gt;0.01%).
3. Their app is intuitive.
4. The buckets in savings are pretty cool/easy to use.
5. Billpay seems easy to use.
6. Customer service is helpful and fantastic.
7. They tell you on the app/web how long the wait is to talk to customer service.
8. The mobile deposit seems to work fine.

The bad:

1. You can't request an ATM card until your account funds. I guess that makes sense, but it seems it should be either automatic, or you request it when you open and then it ships when it funds? Remembering to go back when the funds finally went through to request the ATM card was a pain.
2. Which leads me to: it takes a few days to fund.. so it came out of account at USAA on one day, didn't hit my Ally bank account for a few days.
3. I deposited two checks about two weeks after I opened the account, and both were held for 5 business days. They were checks from Progressive Insurance and Pentagon Federal Credit Union... so not sketchy institutions at all. The email stated "" we have confidential information that indicates that the check may not be paid"", which is BS. I'm a new account holder, say ""for new accounts, we hold all checks for 5 days, we'll stop that painful behavior when your account is &gt;2 months old"" or something. Blatantly lying to people in one of their first interactions is not a good look, and not knowing how long this behavior will persist makes it hard for me to know when I can really trust them to receive my money. So I'm stuck with USAA for a while :(
4. Customer service takes a while to get to. I waited on hold for over 20 minutes, which is way longer than I would at USAA. But.. that's ok. For the interest rate difference, I'll sit on hold for a while. And sometimes, it's only 2 minutes (according to the ticker). So if I really cared how long I sat on hold, I can just time it when the lines are shorter.
5. The app is sometimes wonky... like I have to hit the FaceID thing multiple times to log in, it gets stuck on a screen, or whatever. So far, nothing other than annoyingness (it's always gotten there except see #1 below), but still, feels less mature than the USAA app. Again, I'll take it. They're agile and deliver value quickly, which sometimes means a little wonkiness until they fix it.
6. You can't do some things on the app, like add bills. You can PAY bills once they're added, but you can't add them in the app, only from the web. I think there was one other thing I couldn't do from the app, but I can't remember what it is.
7. Kind of lagginess in received funds: I had my paycheck split between Ally and USAA, and USAA showed it a day before Ally. I think my payer may send a ""we're sending x dollars soon"" message, and USAA says ""ok, we'll make that available"" while Ally says ""thanks for letting us know, we'll make it available when it hits"" (maybe will change when I'm not new? Who knows). Or maybe it's ""here's x dollars with a date of tomorrow"" and USAA says ""ok, show it now"", and Ally says ""ok, show it tomorrow"", or maybe it's ""Here's some money"", and USAA doesn't hold it for a day but Ally does. I'm not sure what caused the difference and if it will go away, but it is different.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""I don't know""

1. The first couple of days I was using it, I got complete failures of the app.. like ""Service unavailable"", and I had to use web. Not sure if that was a fixed bug, a short term issue, app wonkiness, or common behavior. Hasn't recurred since, so the jury is out.
2. I don't know how reliable the bill pay is... haven't paid any bills with them yet.
3. How hard it is to get money out: so far, it's been a one way street: I haven't used my ATM card, transferred funds out, send a wire transfer, or anything else... maybe prone to the same lagginess as incoming money?

&amp;#x200B;

But I will say: my $0.20 interest payments at USAA were immediately dwarfed by the Ally interest payment. It made me cringe to realize how long I've had my money languishing at essentially zero interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Ok, synthesizing some of the comments from below, I need to update a couple of things: 

1) The lagginess of paycheck deposit isn't a lag issue and a con of Ally, it's a normal time, and a pro of USAA, who just gives you access early. 

2) I didn't point out the con of you can't deposit cash (I never need to, so didn't even think of that).

3) The lag on check deposits apparently is a thing for a while. So... if you're  frequent check depositor and need that money quickly, probably not a good choice. 5 business day hold is non-trivial.  

4) Don't try to use foreign ATMs.

5) No known issues with money leaving the account.",finance,1659114513

personalfinance,Debt Plan Sanity Check,"To preface, I have read the sidebar and am a pretty constant lurker here, just want to get a quick sanity check on my current plan of action. 

Debt: 

Wife’s graduate school loans (federal, currently on pause) : 225k, ranging from 6-9% depending on the individual loan

Mortgage : 330k at 3.8% 30-year. Just bought in May, so no meaningful equity yet

No other outstanding debt. Both cars are paid off and we hopefully won’t need new ones for a while. I *may* go back and get my MBA at some point, but right now I have no imminent plan to do so. 



Income: 

Combined 270k starting in August, have been at about 140k/yr combined for the past 3 years while my wife was in residency 


Cash &amp; Investment (excluding retirement): 

60-70k cash, currently in a HY Savings account. 

20-30k in long term investments that I’d rather just let ride and not take any cap gains hits 


My current plan, is to use the majority of the HY savings directly on her highest % loans as soon as the federal pause ends, and then use income to pay down the loans as quickly as possible. 


We both submit to the max match for 401k at our jobs, and max out a IRA every year. I know we should probably start maxing the 401k as well, but I feel like the loans are more pressing. 


So my current plan is Loans &gt; Fully Funded 401ks &gt; Outside Investments &gt; Extra towards the mortgage.

personalfinance,College Tuition - Collections. Advice needed.,"Good afternoon, 
Im not sure how to start this, but I began college in 2018. I’ve never had my parents help, they never took out any loans for school, and I only took out the minimum federal loans, no additional loans. Therefore, the leftover amounts were always my responsibly. Halfway through my year in 2019, I began failing to be able to pay my monthly tuition and thus, dropped out of school. I owed $1,500-2,000 to the university. When I went to pay it off awhile later, I realized they sent it to collections. I’ve rarely gotten calls or any mail from the agency - Capital Reliant. At this point, I cannot enroll in any other college or receive my transcript and I need to figure something out. I am looking to possibly get a loan to pay off the collection so I can enroll in college again. However, everything I’ve read about dealing with collections relates to leftover unpaid federal loans - mine is not a loan. It was what I needed to pay for out of pocket. I’m sad to say this situation has caused complete disarray in my life, constant feelings of disappointment &amp; sadness within myself, and I want nothing more than to resolve it and finish my degree like I know I can. Any advice would be greatly appreciated - I am not sure if I should just wing it, get a loan, and pay off collections or if there is a way to pay less than what I owe, considering they marked it up over $1,000 extra dollars. Btw, I’ve kept this a secret for a few years and do not have anyone to talk to about it. Please spare some advice. I’d do anything to get back into school again because I am quite smart, unfortunately I wasn’t the best at money management. Thank you!",finance,1659121269
personalfinance,I'm almost out of debt but need advice for finishing the job.,"Hi,

  **Context:** I am a college graduate (24) and make &lt; $30,000 per year with zero credit card debt.  I am overqualified for the current job I work full time at and have been aggressively hunting for a job in the field I went to school for since April of this year. If I get into the field I went to school for, I expect to make about $15,000 more per year than what I currently make. 

At the beginning of this year, I had four loans equaling \~ $33,000 in student loan debt (sallie mae). I am **extremely** fortunate to be living at home and not having to worry about rent. Thus far this year I have been able to bring my total private loan debt down to \~$16,900. So just about halfway there. I did this by utilizing a large portion of my savings (\~$6000, leaving a $2500 safety net), a $2000 govt bond that matured, and $2800 from an investment fund my Grandpa setup for me when I was little. The rest has been my own personal income. I would have used more of my savings but tbh my car is at 188k miles and is showing its age. I only have to pay its insurance and a lot of my aggressive pay-off strategy is leveraged in **not** taking on a new car payment soon. But if life deals me a bad straw, I'm somewhat ready.

I do also have $12,000 in federal loans however I haven't made payments due to the freezes in place. So right now I am homed in on paying off the private loans because the interest rates are so damn high. They're variable, and I've seen them go as high as 10% before. 

**Where I need advice:** I'm writing to gauge whether it's wise to utilize my earnings from my stock portfolio. It's nothing crazy, however my portfolio currently has about $4600 in it. I got into Tesla around $400 with three shares, got into AMD pretty early too. These make up about 3/4 of my portfolio. Should I sell these positions and throw them into the next highest interest rate loan? Said loan totals around $8900. 

I'd be giving myself about $3000 just to throw into a loan. My logic is I use my income, plus this influx of money to knock out another loan by November-ish. Because I will be making less than $40k this year, I'm pretty sure that means I won't be taxed on those stock earnings either. 

If you were me, how are you tackling this situation? Are there holes in my plan? Any advice is greatly appreciated even if its outside of what I directly asked for advice on. Thankyou!",finance,1659121426

stocks,FTC sues to block Facebook owner Meta from buying VR fitness app maker,"The Federal Trade Commission is suing to block Facebook owner Meta from buying Within Unlimited, a company that makes the virtual reality fitness app Supernatural, the agency announced on Wednesday. The FTC alleges that Meta is “trying to buy its way to the top” rather than compete on the merits in the VR-dedicated fitness app market, FTC Bureau of Competition Deputy Director John Newman said in a statement.

“Meta already owns a best-selling virtual reality fitness app, and it had the capabilities to compete even more closely with Within’s popular Supernatural app,” Newman said. “But Meta chose to buy market position instead of earning it on the merits. This is an illegal acquisition, and we will pursue all appropriate relief.” A Meta spokesperson said in a statement the case “is based on ideology and speculation, not evidence. The idea that this acquisition would lead to anticompetitive outcomes in a dynamic space with as much entry and growth as online and connected fitness is simply not credible.” The company spokesperson added the agency’s lawsuit sends a “chilling message to anyone who wishes to innovate in VR” and said Meta is “confident that our acquisition of Within will be good for people, developers, and the VR space.”

The lawsuit, which also names CEO and controlling shareholder Mark Zuckerberg as a defendant, echoes issues progressive critics have said the FTC should have raised in Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp roughly a decade earlier. The FTC is already separately suing Meta for illegal monopolization of the personal social networking market, in which the agency charges that Meta used those two acquisitions to shut down nascent competitors to increase its own dominance. Meta previously sought for that lawsuit to be dismissed, though it is still moving forward in a federal court after the judge allowed the FTC to revise its complaint. When the monopolization case was first filed in 2020, Facebook’s chief counsel said the FTC was looking for a “do-over” of its original reviews of the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers, which happened years earlier.

personalfinance,Recently bought a new car. What are my best options after losing my job?,"I've been working steadily for the past 6 years and drove a paid off 2012 Versa. I started having major problems with it in the last year, the check engine light was always on and I replaced the spark plugs, mass airflow sensor and a few other things. My mechanic said the next to go out would be my catalytic converter. You have to turn the key several times or get a jump for it to start. I still have the car as I'm in the process of getting the title switched over since I inherited it from my dad when he passed away a few years ago in a different state and it went through probate. I'd steadily brought in about $4,200 a month and my bare minimum expenses was about $2,300 with me driving the Versa.

In May, I started a 6 month contract job as a soft place to land after leaving a really toxic job. The contract was high paying and with the money I had planned to pay off a new car quickly as well as pay off CC debt (about $3,000). In June, I bought a new car and the car note is $730 a month due to a stupid high interest rate (bad credit, through my own bank) that I'll have to start paying 8/15.

I was unexpectedly fired on Tuesday. I'm aggressively looking for a new job and filing for unemployment. With the car, my bare minimum monthly expenses are about $3,000/month. I have $14,000 in emergency savings and my last two checks can cover 2 months of bare minimum expenses. I've already started cancelling needless subscriptions and plan on living very frugally. I'd like to find a new job as soon as possible but with the possible recession coming, inflation and jobs being slim right now, I don't know how long that will realistically take.

With the car, I have $39k in debt ($36k for the car, $3k CC).

Since paying off the car quickly is no longer an option and the car note is the second highest monthly expense behind my rent, I'm wondering if it may be better to sell the car or trade it in for something more affordable? How does that work? Would it be better to try to fix my old car that I still have? Keep the car and hope for the best? I primarily work from home, but the purpose of the new car was reliable, long term transportation.

For example: if you take a max 50k loan out @ 8% interest with lump sum payment at the end of the year, you could theoretically put an extra $4000 into your 401k for that year assuming that money is coming from a Roth account.

One downside of this is that, your money won't ""grow"" as the growth is coming from your income and not asset appreciation but it’s guranteed., it could also be somewhat resolved by investing the 401k loan into the same assets but in a taxable account as you would have in the 401k and ""transferring"" it over as you repay your loan.

Only loss would be the loan origination fees, which will be dependent on the 401k account broker.

*****
&gt; From Caterpillar to Amgen, dozens of large companies report earnings in the coming week, but it may be big economic data, such as Friday’s jobs report, that takes over as a major market catalyst.
*****
&gt; Monthly employment reports are always important, but the next few may be even more so. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear at his press briefing Wednesday that the Fed’s September rate decision will depend on economic data.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week, helped by better-than-expected earnings reports and a view that the Federal Reserve may not be as aggressive as it forecast when it comes to interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The major stock market indexes ended July with their best monthly performance of the year, and the S&amp;P 500 and Dow scored their best months since November 2020. The Nasdaq’s 12.3% gain was its best monthly performance since April 2020.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P was up 4.3% for the week and 9.1% for the month of July. It is still down 13.3% for the year. The Nasdaq was up 4.7% for the week. The Dow was up nearly 3% for the week and 6.7% for the month.
*****
&gt; “Earnings stink, but they’re not as bad as they could have been,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “The Fed raised rates the most aggressively since 1981, but that’s good because the economy is slowing down, and that’s good because the Fed might start tapering its tone.”
*****
&gt; Some of the biggest names in tech delivered earnings beats in the past week, and their stocks were higher, such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. There have also been some big misses and negative forecasts, like from Meta Platforms and Intel. Intel was down 8.6% Friday after its earnings miss and lowered forecast.
*****
&gt; “Thus far the market has been able to digest it,” said Art Hogan, chief investment strategist at National Securities. “A lot of this is better than feared. If that process continues, it’s likely to help the market grind higher. The market seems to be sitting on this notion that we had priced in Armageddon and thus far, that has not been thrust upon us.”
*****
&gt; Hogan said many investors were caught underinvested or even short stocks during the July rally.
“That helps throw some gasoline on the fire,” he said.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, there are 148 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings. Reports come from a diverse group of companies, such as health-care names Eli Lilly, Gilead Sciences and Amgen. There will also be reports from travel-related companies, such as Uber and Booking Holdings.
*****
&gt; Stocks enter August riding the optimism of July, but since 1995, the S&amp;P 500 has declined by an average 0.5% in the month, according to CFRA. August has also been the third most volatile month, and only three major S&amp;P sectors over that time had averaged gains for the month: real estate, technology and utilities.
*****
&gt; Tech’s outperformance during the month does help the Nasdaq, and the Nasdaq 100 increased an average 0.9% in August, going back to 1995, according to CFRA.
*****
&gt; “It’s a month that could go either way because it has among the highest single monthly advances while at the same time among the deepest single monthly decline,” said Stovall. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 gained 11.6% in August 1992, and fell 14.6% in August 1998.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the S&amp;P 500 could be tested early in the week. The S&amp;P ended the week at 4,130. “Around 4,150 is a very important resistance level,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Recession?
&gt; Investors have been worried about the prospect that the Federal Reserve’s tightening could push the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; However, Thursday’s report that second-quarter gross domestic product declined by 0.9% was taken in stride, in part because the market has been betting the Fed will have to slow down its hiking. The economy has now contracted two quarters in a row, and it is considered to be in what some economists say is a “technical recession.” But most say it is not yet a real recession because of labor market strength and other factors.
*****
&gt; The markets are focused on the potential for a bigger slowdown — particularly the bond market. In the past week, the closely watched 10-year yield fell to 2.64% from 2.75% the week earlier. Yields fall when prices rise, and the 10-year note was lifted by buyers who were concerned about economic weakness.
*****
&gt; The 10-year’s yield is important since mortgage rates and other business and consumer loans are influenced by it.
*****
&gt; “The top tier U.S. data is important for this recession narrative. One thing that kicked off recession talk was the ISM services data, so ISM is going to be important,” said NatWest’s John Briggs. Services ISM slowed less than expected in June, but a measure of employment within the report fell to a two-year low.
*****
&gt; The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing survey is released on Monday, and the ISM services report is due out Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders have been betting in the futures market that the Fed will have to start cutting rates next year, but the Fed’s forecast does not show that. The Fed raised its target fed funds rate by 0.75% of a percentage point Wednesday, the second hike in a row of that size. The next rate hike, expected in September, could be smaller.
*****
&gt; Briggs said the market’s recession worries may be overdone.
*****
&gt; “The jobs report has to be not bad. Powell called the labor market extremely tight, so I just think the market went a little bit overboard here,” said Briggs, “Now it just needs to be not terrible.”
*****
&gt; The July employment report Friday morning is expected to show the economy added 250,000 jobs, according to Dow Jones. That is down from 372,000 jobs added in June.
*****
&gt; “If the jobs report is bad, to me it’s not more good news. ... If the jobs report is bad, it’s more information we’re just begging this recession rather than finishing this recession,” said David Bianco, chief investment officer, Americas at DWS.
*****
&gt; Bianco said he expects the economy is heading for a recession but because of inflation, not the Fed’s rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The big issue for the stock market is tech and how it’s doing since it dominates the market, Bianco said.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks were slammed by rising interest rates, as the 10-year yield climbed earlier in the year. Investors pay up for growth and tech stocks because of the promise of future earnings.
*****
&gt; “People say if the 10-year is done going up, how bad are the technology earnings going to be?” said Bianco. “I caution with the idea that tech will be damaged by recession and a strong dollar and this [would be] from spending on the consumer side and the business side of technology. It’s not that valuations are cheap. ... This may be a shallow recession, but I’m not convinced it’s going to be a short one.”
*****
&gt; Bianco said he likes utilities, health care and aerospace and defense. “For those that want to take a cyclical risk, I like the big banks,” he said. He said the banks do not have the balance sheet issues they had in the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; “The overnight rate is going to be the driver of their net interest margins, especially at the big banks,” he said. “Banks are in a better position than they normally are in a recession.”

&gt; # Fed Chair Powell: The Comeback Kid

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 1% on each of the last four Fed Days going back to March. The March meeting was the first rate hike of the Fed's current tightening cycle, and every meeting since then has seen a hike of at least 50 basis points. Each time, the S&amp;P surged on the day of the hike.

&gt; The recent equity market strength on Fed Days is a new trend. Market performance on Fed Days during Powell's first few years at the helm was notoriously weak. Below we show the S&amp;P 500's average intraday performance on Fed Days by Fed chair since 1994 when policy changes first started being announced on the same day as the meeting. For Chair Powell, we show the S&amp;P's average performance on Fed Days during his tenure only through July 2021. At the time a year ago, Powell Fed Days were by far the worst of any Fed chair, and the market typically plunged into the close after the 2 PM ET announcement.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Powell-1a.png))**

&gt; What a difference a year makes. Below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday performance on Fed Days by Fed chair updated through the most recent FOMC meeting this week. Whereas Powell Fed Days were by far the worst for the market at this time last year, they're now the second best behind only Bernanke Fed Days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Powell-1b.png))**

&gt; To highlight the improvement in the market response to Fed Chair Powell another way, below we show the full-day percentage change of the S&amp;P 500 on Fed Days during Powell's tenure as well as how the cumulative averages have evolved for both the full-day change and performance from 2:30 PM ET through the close (encapsulating the market response to the presser, or the chair more directly).

&gt; As you can see, the S&amp;P was extremely weak on Powell Fed Days early on during his tenure, but over the last year, the market has reacted extremely positively. Seven of the last eight Powell Fed Days have seen positive moves for the S&amp;P, with the last four all seeing gains of more than 1%.

&gt; # Typical August Trading: Usually a Tepid Month

&gt; Money flows from harvesting once made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best DJIA month from 1901 to 1951. However since then and even more recently, over the last 21-years, August has been a disappointing month. The first eight or nine trading days have historically been weak with the major indexes shedding around 0.4% to 1.2%. This weakness is then followed by a brief mid-month rally that typically lasts until the 13th trading day. From there until late month the indexes have tended to wander sideways to lower before springing back to life ahead of month’s end.

&gt; # August’s First Trading Day Weakest of All

&gt; On page 90 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2022, it is shown that the first trading days of each month combined have produced an outsized share of the market’s overall gains. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2022 Almanac. In the upcoming 2023 edition of the Almanac August’s first trading day is still the worst. In the past 24 years DJIA has risen just 36.4% (up 8, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Several sizable gains in those up years, have mitigated the average first day percent change, but the median performance is a more sizable loss. Over the past 11 years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined 8 times.

&gt; # Worst Year for Sentiment On Record

&gt; Bullish sentiment measured by the weekly AAII survey has been a series of back and forth moves over the past several weeks. After reaching the highest level in over a month last week, bullish sentiment fell back down to 27.7%. Even with that decline, bullish sentiment has now managed to hold above 25% for at least three weeks in a row for the first time since the start of the year. We also must note, that the AAII survey collects data from Thursday at 12:01 AM through Wednesday 11:59 PM meaning any boost to sentiment from yesterday's FOMC post-meeting rally will not necessarily be fully captured in this report.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Whereas bullish sentiment has had its fair share of back and forth moves, bearish sentiment has more consistently fallen with this week being the third sequential decline in a row. Now at 40%, bearish sentiment is at the lowest level since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Given the drop in bulls was slightly smaller than that of bears this week, the bull-bear spread continued to move in a less negative direction. However, in spite of any improvement, this week was the 17th negative reading in a row as that streak remains the third longest on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-3a-1.png))**

&gt; Not only have bears outnumbered bulls for 17 straight weeks, but there has actually only been one week this year (the final week of March) in which that was not the case. As a result, this year is on pace to have averaged the lowest levels of bullish sentiment and the highest levels of bearish sentiment of any year in the survey's history.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-AAII-3b.png))**

&gt; With both bulls and bears lower in the most recent survey, neutral sentiment picked up the difference rising to 32.2%. That is the most elevated reading since April and back into the middle of the post-pandemic range.

&gt; # Big Revision in Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims continue to disappoint. Although this week's release technically fell down to 256K, it was from a 10K upwardly revised number of 261K last week. Both this week and last's readings are the highest since the fall and would also mark the highest readings since the fall of 2017 outside of the historically elevated readings of the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; The pandemic was a volatile time period for jobless claims data as readings rose into the millions. As such, revisions over the past couple of years have gotten historically large in turn, albeit less so over the past year. Although it may not sound like much, last week's 10K revision was actually sizable. It was the largest revision since the week of July 4th last year, and prior to the pandemic, the week before Christmas in 2012 was the last time there was a double-digit revision.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-2a.png))**

&gt; In his post meeting presser, Fed Chair Powell mentioned how the rise in initial jobless claims may be seasonal in nature. While we will provide some more in depth analysis to these comments in regards to the data in tonight's Closer, as we have noted in the past, jobless claims have been roughly following standard historical seasonal patterns this year. July typically sees a temporary seasonal spike higher, but as we noted last week, that seasonal peak appears to have been put in place a bit later than usual which is rare but not exactly an unprecedented occurrence. While claims will likely get some seasonal tailwinds in the coming weeks (including this week of the year as claims have fallen around 90% of the time historically), the actual level of claims for the current week of the year is now well above comparable weeks for the few years prior to the pandemic. In other words, before or after seasonal adjustment, claims have come off their strongest levels and revisions have not exactly made things any better.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072822-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, the latest week saw a 25K decline to 1.359 million. While that does mark some deterioration from the strongest levels, unlike initial claims, continuing claims are still well below levels from prior to the pandemic indicating a still very healthy labor market the likes of which has not been seen in decades as the insured unemployment rate (continuing claims as a percentage of the number of those covered by state insurance programs) continues to hover near 1%.

&gt; # Most Countries Remain Below Pre-COVID Highs

&gt; As we do the last Wednesday of each month, today we published our latest update of the Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the major economic data and financial markets of 22 major global economies. Taking a look at the US ETFs tracking these same countries shows a broad move higher in equities around the globe during the month of July. The US has led the way higher as the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) has rallied just over 5%. India (INDA), Sweden (EWD), and Singapore (EWS) have seen the next strongest moves with each one rallying 4% or more. That has brought US equities, India, and Singapore back above their 50-DMAs as well.

&gt; Given those moves are in the context of much larger pullbacks year to date, most country ETFs also currently remain below their pre-COVID highs (the 52-week high as of the S&amp;P 500 peak on 2/19/20). In fact, SPY, INDA, Taiwan (EWT), and Canada (EWC) are the only countries meaningfully above prior highs. Switzerland (EWL) is also technically a part of that list, but the one basis point difference is not much of a margin. At the moment, Brazil is down the most significantly from its pre-COVID high as it is still down 43%. However, unlike many other countries, the year-to-date decline has been very modest at only 1.76%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/072722-GMD-1.png))**

&gt; Taking a look at the charts of the four countries that are handily above their pre-COVID highs, the trends of the past year are not exactly positive. Each one currently sits in a multi-month downtrend, and only India and the US have managed to break above their 50-DMAs. Even if those moving averages have been taken out, further progress by bulls would be required to eliminate those downtrends.

Hello all, I currently have a job but found a better-paying security job as I want to go to the PD at the beginning of next year. I did my paper application (had nothing about any federal docs and nothing about payroll) for them and they gave me a start date. 

The day before I showed up the owner of the company requested my payroll info by text (all he asked for was routing and account) I sent it to him and he claimed he put it in ADP.

Now fast forward 1 month later (due to my current job I never actually started until last week) after my start date, I have not been asked to fill out an I9, W2, W4, 1099, or anything.

What is a big red flag for me is he claims to put my info in ADP but how can you do that without a social or I9? The paper application asked for my social but I never put it down then he claimed to do a next-day background check without a social.

I am also doing armed security so I require a special guard license to open carry a weapon, he claims we will do paperwork but never gets done and the PD is known to stop guards and ask for their cards, if I get stopped and they ask for my card I can go to jail and potentially dash my hopes for working for the PD in February..

So with all of this in mind, I am just trying to find advice about this situation, I am afraid I won't get paid for the days I have worked already. I guess good thing I never quit my main job, I was JUST about to then I sat and thought about everything.",finance,1659139030

stocks,My thoughts about the market !,"So first of all I know that time in the market beats timing the market and dollar cost averaging is the way to go when it comes to long term investing ( that is what I am doing too). However, just for discussion, I think this is a bear market really and I think there is more pain ahead and this is the reasoning: 
- Right now investors are pricing in the fact that inflation has peaked and fed will start lowering interest rates in 2023. The problem with this is that even though gas prices have fallen a bit ( still not low as crude oil is close to $100 a barrel and natural gas is still higher than before ), inflation will still come very high. Let's say that inflation peaked at 9.1%, do we feel good if it will be 6-8% in the next coming months ? I personally do not think that having fed funds rates at around 3.2% will bring down inflation to the targeted area of 2 or even 3 %. Therefore, FED will be forced to keep raising rates even more than what is expected right now. The fact that also unemployment is so low is a nice cushion for them to keep fighting inflation and raise rates. IMO, once we start seeing the news of inflation being still high and FED being more aggresive, the market will start dropping making a new low or at least retesting the $360 area.

stocks,Fed now doing damage control with NYT hit-piece after realizing that JPOW's dovish statement will make inflation fight harder.,"In NYT, one of the Fed's most dovish, Kashkari, says officials are ‘a long way’ from backing off inflation fight.

Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, suggested on Friday that markets had gotten ahead of themselves in anticipating that the central bank — which has been raising interest rates swiftly this year — would soon begin to back off.

“I’m surprised by markets’ interpretation,” Mr. Kashkari said in an interview. “The committee is united in our determination to get inflation back down to 2 percent, and I think we’re going to continue to do what we need to do until we are convinced that inflation is well on its way back down to 2 percent — and we are a long way away from that.”

Given that fact, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said policymakers would now set rates meeting by meeting rather than committing to a broad plan well in advance. Investors took that as a sign that the central bank was likely to slow rate moves sharply in the coming months as the economy slows. In fact, bond market pricing suggests that investors think officials may even begin to cut interest rates next year.

“I don’t know what the bond market is looking at in reaching that conclusion,” Mr. Kashkari said, adding that the bar would be “very, very high” to lower rates.",finance,1659149709

All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people.   It may not be used for any other purpose. 

3. Congress must purchase their own retirement plan, just as ALL Americans do. 

4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise.   Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.

personalfinance,Roth IRA or I-Bond? Which should I focus on next?,"Just for some context, I’ve followed the prime directive flow chart and have just about all of my bases met. I’ve maxed out my 401k, HSA, etc. The only tax advantaged account that I still need to max out for this year is my Roth IRA.

I have about $10k of disposable income to work with over the remaining five months of this year ($2k / month). My plan was to fully fund my IRA, then invest whatever was left in my brokerage account.

The wrinkle is that I have a $20k emergency fund that I also wanted to slowly convert to I Bonds. I’ve read that a safe strategy is to use disposable income to invest in the bonds until I have enough of a cushion that I can start pulling from the actual emergency fund and then start laddering in small amounts. This way, I always have access to cash if I need it—and I would’ve gotten my emergency fund in place where it’s growing with inflation. I realize that if I withdraw it after a year but before 5 years, I’ll forfeit three months’ worth of interest—but it’s still better than the 0.5% interest it’s earning now.

Anyway, so my dilemma is about the timing. Which should I fund first with my $2k / month disposable income for the rest of the year…? The I Bond or Roth IRA?

I keep going back and forth because they both have a $ limit and time component to them.

I Bonds are limited to $10k / calendar year, and the sooner I start buying them, the sooner they’ll be available + I can lock in the 9.62 interest rate.

IRAs are limited to $6k, but I have until April of 2023 to invest for 2022. However, the sooner I invest in this the better too because time in the market &gt; timing the market.

Also, I see IRAs as a wealth building tool whereas I Bonds are more of a safeguard.

So what would you do with the next $10k of income in these coming months? Throw it at the IRA, I Bond, or split it between the two?

https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-new-energy-crisis-11659153633?mod=hp_lead_pos7

America is wrestling with the worst energy crisis in nearly five decades, a period of high prices and limited supply. What makes this crisis different than the troubles that roiled the country in the 1970s is how it started and the fixes required to make it end.

This current challenge began with a decade of affordable power that upended the U.S. energy world. The rise of fracking, which extracts oil and gas from shale rock, unlocked cheap domestic supplies while cleaner energy provided by wind and solar farms became far less expensive. Gasoline and oil prices fell while gas-fired power and renewable power pushed aside costlier—and politically less popular—coal and nuclear plants.

It was an era of cheap, plentiful energy. It came undone thanks to a haphazard transition to renewable energy, reduced investment in oil and gas production, political inaction and unexpected economic forces triggered by the pandemic and lockdowns. Russia’s Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine applied even more pressure to global supplies.

The result was evident across the country this summer as demand surged well ahead of new supply. Drivers paid more than $5 a gallon to fuel their cars and trucks for the first time ever. The price of natural gas used to heat homes and offices hit its highest mark in 14 years. Energy shortages now loom as U.S. stockpiles of everything from crude oil to petroleum products fall. Electricity grid operators have warned of controlled outages to balance supply and demand on the hottest days.

The proposed new legislation that gained key support this past week from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is in part pitched as addressing some of the causes of the current energy crisis. Its passage is uncertain—and in any case the investments in new energy sources it aims to spur would take years to come to fruition.

The deal would spend roughly $369 billion on climate and energy programs, including tax credits for buying electric and hydrogen vehicles. It provides numerous incentives to accelerate the build-out of wind and solar farms, as well as large-scale batteries to store their output for use when production declines. It also has provisions that benefit fossil fuel companies—requiring the Interior Department to offer oil companies millions of federal acres onshore and offshore over the next decade—as well as support for nuclear power production.

Part of the handshake agreement with Mr. Manchin this past week tackles another issue: construction delays on new energy projects. A separate bill could speed up these projects by making the environmental-permitting process faster. The delays are making it challenging to fill a gap left by the closure of older power plants.

Whether any new legislation brings upward or downward pressure on energy prices depends largely on how fast new regulations and incentives are rolled out and which come first, said Bart Melek, global head of commodity markets strategy at investment bank TD Securities. Energy companies face steeper costs of production when dealing with new regulatory hurdles but are slower to factor in incentives in their investment decisions.

“Once you make changes, you have to convince your board of directors that this is a good idea [and] your investors,” Mr. Melek said.

Politicians of both parties didn’t plan for the possibility of this current crisis, making it more difficult to solve. It is a major political problem for President Biden heading into a pivotal midterm election in which the highest inflation in four decades—driven in good part by soaring energy costs—is a kitchen-table issue for voters.

Energy was a political issue for the president from his first week in office, when he blocked completion of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and froze new oil and gas leases on federal land. He backtracked some as gasoline prices rose, resuming the sale of leases to drill on federal lands, albeit at higher royalty prices and with fewer acres offered, and asking oil-and-gas companies to produce more.

While Mr. Biden has asked for more short-term production, he still opposes long-term fossil fuel investments that will make it difficult for the U.S. to meet carbon-reduction targets. His support for policies designed to reallocate investment from oil and gas to green power amounts to a market signal that fossil fuels are a sunset industry, say executives, making it difficult for them to invest.

Energy prices have tempered in recent weeks, as traders bracing for a global recession bet that lower economic activity will cut energy usage. Gasoline prices have fallen to less than $4.30 a gallon recently, in part because prices got so expensive that drivers have stopped filling up as much. The U.S. also has abundant untapped fossil fuel reserves and remains far better positioned than Europe, where energy shortages this winter appear increasingly likely as imports from Russia dwindle.

But a recession might only dent demand temporarily, say energy executives and analysts, and won’t reverse long-term supply issues. Demand is expected to increase for the rest of the decade, according to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.

**Fracking’s fall**

This crisis was unimaginable for many before 2020, when investors were plunking hundreds of billions of dollars into new petrochemical facilities and natural-gas power plants to take advantage of cheap American energy. The rise of fracking—which involves blasting underground shale rocks with a mix of water, sand and chemicals—had unlocked vast new domestic supplies of oil and gas.

From 2010 to 2019, while overall consumer prices rose 19%, energy prices paid by consumers—including gasoline, electricity and natural gas from utilities—rose just 11%, according to Labor Department data. In other words, the real price of energy fell by about 7%. During the prior decade, real energy prices rose 41%.

Coal power, which had been the leading source of power generation in the U.S. for much of the 20th century, was toppled by natural gas in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The shale boom transformed the U.S. from a net importer to a net exporter of petroleum and gas. Investors motivated by low interest rates plowed into fracking, and they triggered a gusher: The U.S. became the world’s top oil producer, surpassing Saudi Arabia. U.S. oil prices fell from about $78 a barrel to $58 from 2010 to 2020, lowering gasoline prices.

One shale producer that initially benefited was Bonanza Creek Energy, which attracted hundreds of millions of dollars from Wall Street investors. Between 2012 and 2019, the company roughly doubled its oil and gas production from about 12,000 barrels a day to nearly 24,000 barrels a day. But the Colorado driller burned through so much cash that it was forced to declare bankruptcy.

The same problems rolled across the industry, as many companies drew on gushers of cash to drill as much as possible with little regard to profitability. Many shale wells turned out to be less productive and more expensive than predicted, and the industry lost $300 billion more in cash than it made between 2010 and 2020, according to accounting firm Deloitte. Those losses soured investors, who began fleeing the sector. That raised oil companies’ borrowing costs and shrunk their budgets.

The result is that shale companies and investors are being cautious now. They aren’t producing enough energy to keep pace with rising demand, even as they now reap large profits from high commodity prices. Most shale-company budgets are still below prepandemic levels, and their spending will only equate to a 3% increase in production next year, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Consider Bonanza Creek, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2017. It expanded production in 2019 and predicted more expansion in 2020 but pulled back when the pandemic took hold. It cut planned capital expenditures to around $65 million from roughly $225 million and laid off dozens of employees.

In November 2021, it merged with a rival to create Civitas Resources, which plans to expand production only moderately or not at all and return all excess cash to shareholders instead of plowing it into new projects. Many of Civitas’ peers are pursuing similar strategies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Occidental Petroleum.

“Financial investors subsidized oil-and-gas companies to grow volume with no regards to profit and essentially subsidized the consumer,” said Ben Dell, chairman of Civitas and co-founder of private-equity firm Kimmeridge Energy Management Co., which owns a nearly 14% stake, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ. “Now, the investors are asking for a return on their capital and, by default, the prices will be higher.”

**The limitations of green energy**

There was a time when it also seemed like it would be relatively easy to replace many fossil-fuel plants with renewable energy and large-scale batteries that store wind and solar power for use as fossil-fuel production declines.

These energy sources became much less expensive over the last decade due to more efficient production as well as government subsidies that made renewables more attractive for investors. Renewable energy, including hydroelectric power, in 2020 became second to natural gas as a source of electricity generation in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

But as U.S. power supplies tighten, developers are struggling to build these projects quickly enough to offset closures of older plants, in part because of supply-chain snarls. Another reason: It takes longer to approve their connections to the existing electricity grid. Such new requests neared 3,500 last year compared with roughly 1,000 in 2015, according to research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Typical time needed to complete technical studies needed for that grid approval is now more than three years, up from less than two in 2015.

One renewable-energy developer, Recurrent Energy, filed more than 20 of these grid-connection requests last year in California, a state that needs more clean power to replace several gas-fired power plants as well as a nuclear plant slated for retirement in the coming years. It took the company seven years to get approval and construct a separate battery storage project in that state.

“It’s only getting harder and harder to get things done in California, specifically, but in every market,” said President and General Manager Michael Arndt.

Wait times can be years for other projects that could also help alleviate energy shortages, such as high-voltage power lines to carry electricity between regions, natural gas pipelines and offshore wind farms capable of generating large amounts of clean power. These require land and ecological studies that many stakeholders say are critical to protecting wildlife, nearby industries and other interests.

The strain is already evident in the Midwest, where Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc. operates a regional grid across multiple states. One of its biggest challenges, said Chief Executive John Bear, is how to replace coal- and gas-fired power plants that can produce power on demand with wind and solar farms where output fluctuates with weather and time of day.

When electricity supplies get tight, MISO calls on every available generator to produce power in what’s known as a “MaxGen” event, something that rarely occurred before 2016. Since then, MISO has had more than 40 MaxGen events, a number of which occurred outside the summer months, when demand is typically highest.

MISO this past week approved a sweeping plan to build high-voltage power lines to help balance supplies, though the projects aren’t expected to be complete until 2030. It is also considering how to better compensate power plants for operating on standby to slow the pace of closures. “The transition may require some scaffolding, and that scaffolding may be some gas plants,” Mr. Bear said.

Project delays—coupled with higher gas prices—present new challenges for utilities, too. They are paying more to produce or purchase electricity while planning big spending increases to upgrade aging infrastructure and prepare for new energy demands.

Xcel Energy Inc., a Minneapolis-based utility company serving parts of eight Western and Midwestern states, is wrestling with slowdowns on solar projects. Those include contracts with solar farms in Colorado that were scheduled to be online in late 2022 and early 2023.

Xcel, through one of its subsidiaries, is now working on contingency plans to ensure adequate supplies for next summer. It plans to invest $26 billion between 2022 and 2026 partly so it can build more high-voltage power lines to carry more power from new wind and solar farms.

Xcel CEO Bob Frenzel said higher energy prices pose near-term challenges for the company and its customers, but he expects they will fall with time. The war in Ukraine, the pandemic and supply chain snarls, he added, would have been easier to manage if they didn’t converge.

“You put those three factors in a mixing bowl, and you come up with a bigger challenge,” Mr. Frenzel said.

**‘No one knows what to do’**

The actions of the U.S. government also contributed to this current crisis. Federal decisions made over the last three decades to encourage competition, lower costs for consumers, sell oil and gas to foreign buyers and encourage the development of more renewable sources are having unintended consequences now that the energy market is in turmoil.

It began with the decision to deregulate the electricity industry, a movement that first gained support following the energy shortages of the 1970s and gathered more momentum with the 1992 passage of the Energy Policy Act, which encouraged competition among wholesale electricity suppliers. The federal government also lifted price caps on natural gas and created incentives for more renewable energy sources to take root in markets around the country, hoping to prop up technologies that didn’t rely on oil and gas.

What this new system created in the subsequent decades was a patchwork of markets across much of the country with different regional operators, leaving state regulators and power grid managers to do much of the planning. Coordination across regions became more challenging as states set different goals to reduce carbon emissions.

Consider what happened in California when the state experienced rolling blackouts in 2020 after temperatures rose across the West. The state had substantially reduced its reliance on gas-fired power plants in recent years in favor of renewable energy, giving way to evening supply crunches on hot days when solar production tapers off. California has historically imported a lot of power from neighboring states in times of need, but it was constrained in its ability to do so during the 2020 heat wave because neighboring states also had numerous plants close and thus had less power to spare.

“You had too much capacity come off the market too quickly and now all the markets are scrambling for reliability,” said John Arnold, a former natural gas trader who now is a billionaire philanthropist.

Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden all encouraged U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas. The U.S. became the world’s top LNG exporter this year as it sent huge volumes to Europe to help replace Russian supplies. But those same exports are now driving up domestic gas prices because U.S. consumers are effectively competing for supplies with foreign buyers, say analysts, and will keep prices elevated for years to come due to long-term supply contracts signed by exporters.

The U.S. government has more recently taken steps to help with the nation’s transition to renewable energy sources. For example, it expanded its authority to intervene in state-level permitting processes for high-voltage power lines as a way of helping balance electricity supply and demand across regions. Mr. Biden is also trying to lower high energy prices by asking Saudi Arabia, which he had vowed to treat as a “pariah” after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, to pump more crude. He traveled there earlier this month.

One former regulator said the current situation reminds him of a period five decades ago when an Arab oil embargo and revolution in Iran led to a rethinking of energy policy in the U.S. and Europe. But it is also different, he said.

so, we filled the gaps but made a big gap doing so. studies shows that about 91% of the gaps gets filled eventualy (no specific time though).

also, we almost at 200ema resistance level on daily chart, nasdaq and s&amp;p are on the way to hitting that EMA also.

macro enviornment hasn't changed and were still in a bear market, add to it the 2nd negative GDP number which technicaly means we entered the ""R"" word that JP was so afraid to say during the FOMC meeting.

personalfinance,Unhappy About Locked Mortgage While Rates are Falling,"Went under contract with a house a couple weeks ago. Put about 28% down and my credit score was at least 760 with each of the three credit bureaus. Lender which was used for the contract gave me a rate of 6.0% with buying half a point.

\[Relevant background, I'm a terrible/spineless negotiator: fairly easily manipulated and with poor social skills. Not trying to be self deprecating; just trying to give the context of me not knowing when I'm being pushed around and also not recognizing if I'm being too passive or too aggressive with another party.\]

I was pretty upset when I saw that the average 30 year fixed, conventional was around 5.8% at the time. My national bank (Ally via Better) was offering no points, no origination fees, and around 5.3%. 

Sounded pretty good. My real estate agent was OK with exploring other lenders, but he warned me that the seller would need to agree to adjust the contract and they could be wary of using a big national instead of a local lender. This sounded reasonable; my sister nearly lost a house due to working with a slow moving big bank. (30 day close, btw.)

I decided to contact another local lender. The guy I spoke to didn't seem to think my original lender was too far off the mark, but he thought he could do better because of the large down payment and good credit scores.

It took him a long time, and the clock was ticking, so I showed the Ally offer to the original lender. They came back with a 5.85% interest rate and eliminated the points. The second local lender came back with the same interest rate but kept the points.

I told him (the second lender) that the first lender had already given me a better offer, but the second guy said to give him a chance to do better when the market opened the next day. I did, and he came back something like 5.65% with not points.

This was obviously better, but I didn't think it was really worth it to try to renegotiate the contract and switch lenders for minimal savings (both monthly and long term). My present lender had also waived the appraisal (and fee) because of the size of the down payment, so that would save time and money. 

I did, however, pass the new offer on to my original lender. The original lender refused to budge and got a little irritated; he made it sound like they were losing money because they already gave me a break and they couldn't do anything else.

I decided to stick to my instincts and declined the  second lender offer. Now, it was his turn to be a bit irritated, and he wanted me to give him the rate it would take get me to switch. He also ended our discussion by saying that my present lender wasn't being fair to me if they wouldn't reduce my rate if rates continued to fall.

Presently, rates ARE continuing to fall. It looks like the national average for a 30 day fixed is around 5.5% and some banks like Ally are offering 5.1% or lower. A better rates could be worth $100 - $200 in saving per month for me.

Is it wise to try to put some pressure on my present lender to come down more - is it common or ""the right thing to do"" to decrease customer rates as national rates fall? (I really think they high balled me from the beginning.) Should I try for another lender like the second guy? Or does wisdom say that I should just be satisfied where things fell. I don't want to be greedy but I also don't want to be taken advantage of.

Closing is relatively soon, but imagine because the appraisal is waived this mitigates the timing issue.

1. If I got the HELOC and immediately draw 100k at 4.2% interest. If I never touch the HELOC again, will I be paying the same 4.2% interest on that 100k for the remainder of time, or will that interest rate/interest payment fluctuate on that 100k? (my understanding is that variable rate/traditional HELOCs are the latter, and a fixed-rate HELOC works more like the former)
2. What are the risk factors associated with my house value falling? With just a mortgage, my understanding is that even if you're underwater, if you can still make the monthly payment, then the bank won't really care. But is that the same situation with a HELOC?",finance,1659221929
solar,Unusual (possibly illegal?) quote from a solar company,"I've been considering a solar installation for my house - a grid-connected, net-metered system, no batteries or things like that. This is in the USA in the state of Idaho.

Company 1 quoted me a 29-panel 10.7 kw system, including tree trimming, installation, and replacing my 21-year-old AC system.

While it makes sense as an overall power-saving plan - that old AC system is probably the most inefficient thing in my house - a rep from a different solar company was quite surprised at the AC being included in the solar installation package. He said he's never seen that done before, and now I'm wondering - is it even legal? 

Both companies offered a financing package with very low interest over a 25 year term. Both companies included tree trimming as part of the installation. Both companies offered to include a smart thermostat and LED light bulbs. But Company 1 basically  told me the maximum amount of financing I was approved for, and then suggested this was an opportunity to do additional remodeling that I wanted done - including items that aren't related to power or energy efficiency at all, such as cabinetry, counters, etc. The solar company rolls everything into one big project quote, which won't be itemized, and a percentage of the entire project will be eligible for a federal tax credit. Now, as much as I'd love to pay less taxes, I also see a pretty big potential for fraud here.

stocks,Opinion: the actions of the current Fed indicate that it has a slightly dovish bias and therefore we should still be bullish asset prices.,"&gt;We don't see the world as it is, we see it as we are.

&gt;-Anais Nin

The future is fraught with uncertainty, and no one has a crystal ball.  We are all trying to predict what the Fed does based upon our own personal biases, of which we all have many.  Our forecasts probably say way more about our positions than they do the future.  And while these biases are impossible to remove entirely, I believe that on the balance, the current Fed fundamentally leans dovish.

They like growing the economy.  And they really don't like job losses or economic slack.  When making a decision, they rather err by making too many jobs than too little.

While it's obvious now that price stability is their top priority, I believe they still care a lot about unemployment and will genuinely do the absolute best they can to achieve a soft-landing.

Whether they can successfully do that is very much up for debate but past actions continually support that they tilt dovish.

* 2016 rate hike cycle was very gentle.  Extremely well-telegraphed, minimal surprises.
* Paused QT without making a significant dent in the balance sheet.
* Currently behind schedule on MBS runoff.
* Clear willingness to take dramatic and unprecedented steps when presented with a crisis, like in Covid.
* Inflation evidence was building fairly strongly way before the commodities crisis spurred by the Ukraine war.  CPI was almost 8% without the invasion.
* They probably could have started to unwind sooner, many were calling for it but they were quite resolute despite pressure.
* They believe 2.5% FFR is neutral which appears to definitely be on the lower end of the range, compared to most economists.
* **They seem to be pivoting already.  The market is pricing in rate cuts as early as March and a full point by EOY 2023**.

First post on personalfinance, so please give some advice to a slightly clueless 22 year old in need of some savings advice. My partner and I would like to generate extra cash for future life expenses and I have a dilemma.

As everyone knows, I Bonds have a very attractive interest rate with a purchase cap of $10k/year. I do not have the financial independence quite yet to immediately purchase $10k worth of I Bonds, but I want to invest ASAP so I don’t get hit with the penalty for withdrawing prior to the 5 year mark.

Would it be stupid to purchase smaller amounts of I Bonds over time (for example, buying a 1k I Bond now and purchasing another 1k bond in 6 months) versus waiting til I have a larger lump sum and maxing out that 10k limit? I make a decent salary right now, but seeing as I just started my career, I’m not sure how long it would take me to save 10k that I’m willing to store away and feel comfortable not touching for 5 years. Unless there’s a hidden disadvantage to do so, why not just purchase what I can afford at the moment as opposed to letting years of savings slip by?

Purchasing smaller bonds over time seems like a far more achievable milestone. But I don’t want to be doing something stupid!! Thank you for your time :)",finance,1659238312

personalfinance,Paid down car loan - Was that the right decision?,"Just for clarification: I live in another country than the US, all values are converted roughly.

Last week we (my wife an I) paid down our car loan of 13k for a car we bought 18 months ago. We initially saved up that money in that period to rebuild our cellar after a water leakage, but due to shortages and long waiting times for workers (we do most of it ourselves, but some things have to be build by code which needs certification in my country) we kind of had extra money sitting around. So we decided to use that money for something; in addition we save us a good amount of interest rates which are expected to raise in the future anyway. I guess potentially we save more on paying down the loan than on putting away the money in funds or similiar, especially in these uncertain times. Now we are debt free (except the mortgage of $1000 and two interest-free study loans of together $300).

Now I'm having second thoughts. While the rebuilding of the cellar is no haste, it still would be good to get it done; now it is definitely delayed until next year. I have the materials for all rooms, I just cannot finish it before some basic work is done by the contractor.

What is more of a question to me is, if we have enough of an emergency fund currently. Alltogether it's 17k divided into funds, ""high"" interest rate accounts and normal accounts available instantly. We live in a single family house, and have 3k to 3,5k expenses including mortgage, insurances, food, clothing, everything (my contries costs for living are known to be some of the highest in the world). One thing I can add is, that I dont have to be afraid of any health emergencies, since any doctor and hospital visits in my country are free except of a small fee in the 20-ish dollars. Also all salaries are paid for 1 year in full and 80% in the following year(s) in case of longer illness, so on that front we have nothing to worry about.

My wife got a new job recently, which gives her additonal 650 to 700 extra after taxes per month, additionally we ""win"" 250 extra per month from the missing car loan. Our income after all taxes paid was roughly 5400 per month before her raise.

Was the paying down of the car loan the right decision or should we have waited? It's hard for me to realize if we are good off or not, mostly I grew up poor and I know how it is to get yourself drown in debt and getting nowhere financially, so probably I am just exagerating.

Addition:  The loan had an effective interest rate of 4,8%  and was for 5 years. We paid down a big sum on christmas already.",finance,1659273517

personalfinance,Chase Credit Card/Bank Won't Negotiate on Interest Rates!,"Those with credit card balances have been concerned recently about the higher interest rates nearing 20% or more.  If you look at the education section under Chase Credit you will find the following.  The problem is that apparently this does not apply to Chase itself.  I called them and they said as policy they do not adjust interest rates and it did not matter anything about my personal circumstances.  They again emphasized they do not at all under any circumstances.  I pointed the following out to them which is on their education page and they had no awareness and did not care.  I suggested they clarify in this section it applies to other companies and not them.  Has anyone experienced this or has suggestions on how to work with Chase to lower interest rate?

 How can I pay off my credit card with high interest?

If you want to reduce the balance faster, but can't afford to substantially increase your monthly payments, try the following:

* **Negotiate a lower interest rate**. If you noticed that your interest rate has increased (which will make it harder for you to pay off over time), you may be able to contact your credit card company to negotiate a rate that works for you. If you have a variable interest rate, it may have increased due to state laws and this may be more difficult to negotiate. However, if you have a fixed rate, your interest could still increase due to late or missed payments, a high balance or drops to your credit score. If you are a long-time cardholder with a positive payment history, you may be able to explain your financial situation to your creditor and possibly lower your rate.

personalfinance,Home equity loan options for home repair,"Hello, I am looking for some advice on home equity loan options. My wife and I just found out that we need to have the siding on our home replaced along with a few other exterior repairs. It is old Masonite and there is swelling and rot that could cause problems in the future. We have a reasonable emergency fund, but it has taken a slight hit lately due to our 11 month old son and our budgeting estimates being slightly off for his expenses. Based on the estimates from the contractors we have contacted we would need a loan to cover the costs of these repairs. Our budgeting is improving, but things are still tight monthly right now. However, both my wife and I will be moving to jobs that pay much better within the next year. 

It seems like our best option is to leverage our home equity to borrow for this project. Even though we bought about 3.5 years ago, we have considerable equity thanks to the increasing home prices in our area. Family, friends, and neighbors have suggested we explore a home equity line of credit for this type of work. I have reached out to a few local credit unions and explored some online options and it seems like our choices are: 

* 1) use a HELOC to get our home repaired and start paying off the debt aggressively once we move to better jobs. 

* 2) Fixed rate home equity loan, but the payments would be challenging to manage and still contribute to retirement at this time.

* 3) A home improvement loan through a credit union that is very similar to a home equity loan, except no lien on the house.

* 4) Put off the repairs until we move to the new jobs.

The variable rate of HELOCs is concerning to my wife and I as we worry about substantial increases in the future, on top of the recent increases that have been happening. If we do choose a HELOC, we are leaning towards using Third Federal which seems to have the best rates. We also have neighbors who have used them and had good experiences in similar situations. We could put off the repairs for a while longer, but we are worried about increases to the cost of the project due to materials or further labor shortages and we have a contractor ready to start the job soon that is referred and well regarded. 

Could anyone provide advice on borrowing money in a situation like this? Should we be concerned about rate changes with HELOCs or is this a very common type of loan? Is now a good time to borrow or does the current situation suggest that we wait and tackle this later? Any advice you can offer is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1659278373

personalfinance,Rent (un)furnished or sell,"Howdy,

My partner and I bought a condo last year that we spent a lot of effort / money on to make look nice.  Due to unforeseen circumstances we are strongly looking to move a great distance and are considering our options with the condo.  

We did buy it before hyper-inflation so we got a great deal on the interest rate.  Due to that and just that we like the place, we have some interest in renting it if possible instead of selling.  Also given the effort to make it look nice and how much it would be to move furniture to the new place, we had a thought to rent it furnished so that we could get a higher monthly rate for it.

Would also look to buy in the new place.

My questions are:

1) Are there helpful resources for understanding how the furnished vs unfurnished rental market works?  Guessing you'd get a lot more short to medium term rentals for furnished and wanting to understand what comes with that.
2) What's a helpful model for budgeting when looking at keeping a rental?  I definitely don't want to plan on having 100% occupancy but wondering if we should make sure we could pay both mortgages without a renter indefinitely or if this seems overcautious.  Currently in a large city with a healthy rental market.
3) Are there any key considerations I might be missing?",finance,1659283561

personalfinance,Financing to Renovate House,"Hi, I'm a 40f with an annual salary of about 80k (only had this income a few years.) I bought a small semidetached home in 2010 for 98k. I hate the house because when I bought it I couldn't afford to do much with it and couldn't afford to upgrade anything. My husband started tearing it down inside as we aren't currently living there so currently it's not in livable state (basically just an empty shell.) He's abandoned the project last year so it's just been sitting. I want to renovate and move back into the house as we are now separating and do a complete renovation of the entire space. Right now the total estimate to do what I want is about 45k. I have about 11k in cash that I can put in as well as a 15k line of credit with my CU, some retirement accounts I can borrow from, and whatever equity based off evaluation of the property (which isn't looking too good right now.) I spoke to 'RenoFi' and they will finance the project based off appraisals with a fixed interest rate of 6.25%, it's basically a second mortgage. Since I bought this house when I only made about 36k I am confident I can afford the payments on whoever will loan me the money, but it's been tough with the house not in a good state to have any sort of appraisal done on it... With the market the way it is, houses on my street have sold for as much as 300k so I feel it's a sound move to put the money into it to live there until I decide what's next. Can anyone offer any sound advice on alternatives to finance? I was told my credit score is 788 and clean, I'm a nurse so not even the pandemic can stop me from earning my salary. 

I feel I am finally reaching financial security but unfortunately I'm stuck living with my husband in his also demo'ed house and can't do this anymore. I understand I don't have the money saved, but really want to try to move forward with this plan. I wish I had more time to plan and save but that's not something life is allowing me right now. Any advice is appreciated!

solar,Points on the solar loan,"This correct? It just feel wrong:   I have a quote for a system for $27,048.  Lets assume that is a good price and not get hung up on that.  The amount I am financing, though, is $38640. Apparently I am paying $11,592 in 'points' to lower the apr on the loan from 5.99% to 0.99%.  This brings the monthly payment from $135/mo (after handing over the fed tax rebate) to $104/month.  I am guessing that this 'works' because I am essentially wrapping the interest into the loan, then using the fed system rebate to cover 26% of it.    


The 'base' system at 27,048 generates a $7,032 tax credit that is applied to the loan.  Then  299 (25 year loan) X135$ = $40,365 .  (Total of $47397, but I would pay the 40365)  


The base + points at 38,640 generates a $10,046 tax credit, that is applied to the loan than 299 x $104 = 31,096$ Total of $41,142.  (I pay 31,096)

We decided to sell the house so I didn't go back to work.

Of course that tanks both of our credit scores, we are trying to purchase a home with cash from selling the house that's a few hours away. We are currently living in a camp trailer on my in-laws property. We are looking at getting temporary jobs out here just to have some sort of income. I just worried that we will be foreclosed on before we can sell the house. We haven't been financially smart; eating out too much, not building savings of any kind etc. We've moved out most of our stuff and tried selling things we don't need and could replace in the future. (tv's, tv stand, furniture) People haven't wanted much of them though.

I know most of these problems of our own design and we've been working towards being smarter financially. We just have bad habits that are hard to break, Our only car is having transmission issues so we've been using SIL's car to get around and do the prep on the house.

personalfinance,Looking for some feedback/sanity checking of the strategy for investing house sale gains,"Hey folks! I'd really appreciate a sanity check on my approach to investing post-house-sale gains. Handling this quantity of money all at once is new to me and I'd love to not make a dumb mistake.

**Background**: Bought a house in the midwest about 3 years ago, moved a couple months ago for a new job, just closed the sale and cleared about $90k in profit.  I'm 27 years old and my partner and I are unmarried, but we've been together for \~8 years. No actual specific savings goals right now other than to just protect the gains against inflation and make the money do some work. In the future I'm sure we'll want to buy another house, and we're both considering grad school programs, but these are vague goals that aren't actionable at all and are highly subject to change.

**Investing Experience**: Little to none. I do have a 401(k) that I put enough into to fully utilize employer matching funds, so that account is pretty healthy and my new employer has a very similar match to my old one. I understand what the various personal financial mechanisms *are*, and I've played around with a couple grand in the stock market before (now just invested in index funds and a small selection of lingering individual stocks), but I don't have experience with executing a cohesive strategy.

**Current Financial Commitments**: Nothing significant. The city we moved to is too expensive to buy in, so we're renting here. I have a car loan that's at 2.95% and isn't causing any financial strain. I have a few grand in federal student loans left over at 3% that have just been hanging out with the COVID postponements and only cost like $55/month when they are active. With inflation, these seem reasonable to allow to continue to function as loans (let's assume I'm not going to pay these down, for the sake of discussion). Our normal salaries far exceed our living expenses with plenty of space for fun stuff and savings contributions. The day-to-day budgeting aspect is pretty rock solid imo.

**Plan as it stands right now**:

1. A couple fun purchases (new bicycle for me, new embroidery machine for my partner). That will eat a few grand.
2. Throw \~3 months worth of living expenses in a savings account (likely Discover) as the emergency fund. This would be roughly $15k. Savings were certainly not formalized before, so this feels wise.
3. Push the rest of the profit into various robo-managed accounts with varying levels of risk tolerance. I opened up an account with Betterment and I opened a Fidelity Go account since I already have various accounts with Fidelity. I would plan on funding these accounts with maybe $20k on Monday, then assuming that transfer goes smoothly, pushing an additional $40k or so into them shortly thereafter.

**The ask**: Other than that, what should I be doing? Is there a particularly strong reason to add specific funds, I-bonds, or other financial products to the mix? Should I put more of my money into index funds? Is there something really stupid and standard that I should be considering?",finance,1659309319

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car now or keep paying monthly bills?,"I have around $3000 left on my car and I have been paying $500 a month which is $75 more than actual amount due. My interest rate is 1.9%, and last month interest was $6 vs $494 towards principal. I was thinking to pay it off and then keep investing $500 a month into some fund or just wait few months? Is there any real benefit of paying it off now or in 6 months?",finance,1659310072

personalfinance,Does anyone here use infinite banking through a life insurance policy?,I have a life insurance policy set up at an investment account to be able to access money while I’m alive. It’s a guaranteed 4% compound interest rate of return for what I invest through it plus any dividends. I’m still learning how best to use the policy to my advantage. I’m just curious how popular this is or how much people in general know about it. Have you heard of this? Do you have an account and any suggestions how best to utilize it to my advantage? Have you heard of this but have reservations about it or don’t agree with it as a strategy of investing? Most of my friends and family don’t understand it or know what I’m talking about when I try to explain it.,finance,1659311106
Economics,In March of 2020 the fed dropped the reserve requirement to 0 percent. This obviously increases the multiplier effect on currency. Are our metrics catching all of these increases? Why is this not a large part of the conversation on inflation? Why hasn't the fed increased it?,,finance,1659311245
