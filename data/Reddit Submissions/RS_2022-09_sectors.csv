personalfinance,Car help - Long post,"Hey all: Long-time stalker, first-time poster. 

I (34F) am a 4th-year clinical student in Veterinary school. I spent my first 2.5 years abroad in the Caribbean at an accelerated university (which is why I'm a 4th year now) and came back to the states in June to finish my last full year here. I am living on (LOTS of) student loans, currently at 260k, and will graduate with around 340ishk, so I'm planning on essentially dying in debt. I love what I do and I'm good at it. I was driving a 2010 Subaru Legacy that my parents generously gave me when I came back from the Caribbean, but it was on its way out and I was planning on driving it till it died. 

I will be graduating in May 2023 and will be moving to CO to be with my SO, and my plan was to get a decent job (starting salaries are 100k+ with sign-on bonuses galore) and then look into buying a new car (28k-35k range). 

However: 2 days ago, my car and I were in an accident. I had right of way and was T-boned in a way that my rear axle is likely bent and the rear left tire was not stable enough to drive it. The tow truck driver said it's likely totaled, but I don't have any way of knowing just yet. I called my insurance and filed a claim with them, as well as called the police and filed a police report. I have the other driver's info, phone number, and car registration stuff. He did not have his insurance info on him but stated he did have insurance (skeptical). Since the car was gifted by my parents, they still are the main people on the insurance, and the car is registered in a different state than where I am currently located. I'm not sure of the ramifications of this. The car also didn't have collision coverage, so I have not been able to get a loaner car, and I expect the insurance ordeal to take at LEAST a month. 

My issue is I NEED a car. There is no way to finish out my clinical year without one. I need to be able to travel to different rotation sites in this state and in a few others that are scheduled throughout the year. 

Right now I have:

6k in savings that I recently put there to save for a car once I get to CO. 

8k in a Roth IRA in ETFs

4k in my checking account, and another 10-12k coming in the form of financial aid next month(which I would rather not have to touch), which currently is still at 0% interest, but will be at the federal interest rate of I think 7ish% once that comes back. 

No CC debt other than my monthly grocery purchases which I pay off every week

I pay $900 a month in rent which is prepaid until the beginning of November (all utilities included) 

$30-35 in my cell phone bill

Approx $200-$250 a month in groceries

was paying maybe $60 a month in gas 

and gave myself $100 for ""stuff"" buying

Have a few days a month side gig working with another professional making 300-400 a day (but only 1-3 days a month and likely wont continue past November)

I have very good job opportunities, but I do not have a job lined up yet as I am not even licensed or graduated yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering different options, but still don't have a clue as to what the insurance is going to do. If the car is totaled, I don't think I will get much for the car (honestly have NO idea what they would give me). The car was drivable with no known engine issues. Had a new battery, new tires, and about 2k worth of miscellaneous fixes in May of this year. I also had the catalytic converter replaced recently since it was still under warranty and had a recall. So all in all, it had quite a few dings and dents but was a perfectly fine car for the time being. 

So I'm not sure what the best options are. I've been considering looking for a new car, and putting whatever money I get from the insurance toward a down payment. I live well below my means as it is and since coming back to the states have barely touched my finaid, so I know I can put money toward a car if I absolutely have to. I've also considered leasing a car with the option to buy it later when I do have a job and can more rightfully afford a higher monthly payment, but im not sure if that would be worth it in the end since I've been told leasing to buy is just a waste of money. My SO thinks the insurance should give me enough money to get a car of equal value, but with the market the way it is right now, I'm not sure id be able to get anything worth driving for 6-8k (what i assume my car might be worth). And to top it all off, I dont really have the time or ability (no car) to go car shopping. There are a butt load of used car places around me, but again, the prices are astronomical. I feel like its almost a better deal to go for a new Honda civic or Toyota camry (Or something like a Mazda3 which Ive owned before and loved) and just figure out how to pay it. I have very good to excellent credit (even with my load of student loans), and if absolutely necessary can get financial help from my SO, I would just rather not at this moment in time since I've been going to him for help for the past few years while I've been working on my education. 

ANY and ALL advice would be appreciated. I just feel completely lost and know that I can easily fall prey to bad car salesmen.",finance,1661990809
personalfinance,Personal Line of Credit before or after selling our house?,"Hi there. I wanted to get some input on what might be a better way to go. We are currently selling our house and moving abroad and we'll have quite a nest egg from the sale of the house to be able to purchase at the new place.

I'm thinking about applying for a personal line of credit and I'm wondering if I should wait until after the sale of the house is cleared so that my debt to income ratio is better or if I should do it while I still own and have ""equity.""

The reason for the person line of credit would be to add to My buying power at the destination country and act as emergency availablity of cash if needed.  A mortgage loan at the destination country is not an option.

I'm aware of all the pros and cons of a personal and a credit versus a personal loan versus credit cards versus home loans, which is not an option. What I'm curious to know is what would best help my case to get the highest possible limit or best possible interest rate.

Thank you for your time",finance,1661992951

Forex,New to Forex. Question about buying JPY.,"Familiar with stocks/options, but new to Forex. The JPY caught my eye, as it seems it caught many of yours skimming the sub. Without really understanding the nuances, the degenerate gambler in me thinks it will rebound soon.

I just submitted for approval to trade Forex in my account, but don't really know the best way to do it. I know I sell one currency to buy another. Should I just do USD/JPY? Is there a weaker currency to buy it against? If the US actually continues to raise interest rates, I think that would be bad for my trade, so I'd prefer to pit it against something that will only get weaker as the JPY gets stronger.

Any insight is appreciated.",finance,1661995471

personalfinance,"First-time loan, using Santander for auto--should I refinance with another lender?","If anyone has experience with Santander as well as another lender, that might help in particular. Last year, I had to get a new car, I'm young and had no credit at the time so my dad luckily cosigned for me, but Santander was the lowest interest rate possible because his credit also isn't great, which is fine, that's how it goes. Since I've been careful not to miss a payment though, my credit has bumped up a lot.   


My original interest rate is 21.78 APR, and the payments are a good amount on top of that; as I'm trying to slowly wean myself off using my parents financial assistance day to day (alongside needing money for travel and emergencies, and hopefully investment eventually) I was thinking of refinancing in hopes it would make things easier. Now my question is, should I try some other things to enhance my credit first so it's the best possible, and should I stick with santander or go somewhere else? (For instance, I have a credit union nearby that's got a good rep, especially for auto loans). Will it all be worth the hassle?

I also had an issue just this month that made me feel a little sour towards them. It was honestly my fault, but they didn't help for shit, I had to take it up with my bank instead and it was super stressful on top of other things rn. I'm petty, what can I say.",finance,1661999108

personalfinance,payroll deductions in the u.s. - i may be overlooking something obvious?,"first of all, thank you in advance. i tried googling thoroughly, to no avail. that said, i'm terrible at math and mathematical thinking, so i may be overlooking something obvious here. please be nice if it is obvious - i would be grateful to understand.

pertinent info:

i'm an hourly worker.

deductions from my paycheck: medicare, social security, state tax (it's a flat amount) and federal tax.

no pre-tax deductions for anything.

**the question: why is the** ***percentage*** **of my deductions fluctuating paycheck to paycheck?** my potentially wrong understanding is that medicare, social security, and state are all flat (in my case), and the federal tax rate should only change when i enter a new bracket, not paycheck to paycheck. (is this a withholding issue? if so, why would it fluctuate? are there other factors i haven't considered?)

**these are appropriately rounded numbers, but-**

this last pay period, i kept 78% of my paycheck.

the one before: 82%.

and before that: 81%.

and before that: 83%.

and before that: 81%.

**so: why are these percentages changing every two weeks? what have i missed?**

personalfinance,Moving $ between HYSA frequently,"I had savings in a Chase savings account. A few years ago I learned that Capital One has a better interest rate so I moved the majority of my balance to that account. I've now discovered that Discover has a sign up bonus for new online Savings customers, and their rate is also good at the moment.

So my question is: as long as I'm not exceeding transaction quantity limits and such - is this a smart move, to transfer the majority of the funds every so often when I see a better deal?

MachineLearning,"[D] Paper lost and found: Is there ever a paper about a method called ""cultural evolution""?","I vaguely remember from the depth of my head once reading about a method roughly named *cultural evolution*. The method is a low-communication distributed training strategy, where you do distributed data parallel without gradient all-reduce. Instead, a small proportion of data in the batch is fed to every worker, and the outputs for these shared examples are synchronized across workers. (Not all-reduced, so each worker gets a copy of the outputs for every other worker.) Then, each worker is supervised to predict similar outputs on those shared examples to the averaged output of other workers by a consistency loss.

Is this a real method ever proposed by someone? Is there a paper about it? Or did I hallucinate it and probably should actually try it myself?",technology,1662006857
algorand,Is Lofty AI operating in violation of US securities laws?,"I am not posting this to shit on Lofty or tell you not to invest with them. By all accounts, they operate a polished product and a legitimate business. I am making this post as a fair warning to people, so that they can understand what exactly they are getting into before making an investment.

I was surprised to learn that as a non-accredited US investor, I was able to invest with Lofty, since securities offerings must be SEC registered to be sold to the general public in the US. My first assumption was that they registered their offerings with the SEC, which is extremely uncommon for a blockchain project. However, this is not the case; instead, they make the argument that what they offer is **not** a security.

On the surface, Lofty's property tokens do appear to be securities.  According to the Howey Test, a security is defined by the following criteria:

* An investment of money
* In a common enterprise
* With the expectation of profit
* To be derived from the efforts of others

Keep in mind, all 4 prongs must be met to constitute a security.

The first 3 prongs of the Howey Test are certainly met in this case, and so there is no need to go any deeper. Given the ability to passively invest in properties that are managed on my behalf with rental income collected and distributed to me, it would also appear the 4th prong is met. I literally don't have to do anything beyond collect my money.

So how exactly is Lofty offering tokenized real estate to US investors?  Last year, a Reddit user emailed the Lofty team and asked the same question. Here is the relevant portion of their response (full post can be viewed [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/oy2xlx/updatei_emailed_lofty_over_my_concerns_and_they/)):

&gt;We're  currently engaging with regulators to make a presentation that  what we  are offering are not actually securities. This is because in  essence,  we're using technology to allow a group of real estate  investors to  invest together in a single real estate property. This  process happens  thousands of times per year in the US where a group of  friends or small  investment club get together, pool funds, to purchase a  rental house  as an investment. Frequently, these groups will often  utilize an LLC as  well to make sure they're not all individually liable  for anything  related to the operations of the rental property. As you  can imagine,  very few, if any, members in these groups register the  investment as  securities, nor do they take the time to verify each  member's  ""Accredited Investor"" status. Yet, none of them are prosecuted  by  regulators, both state and federal, as offering un-registered   securities for sale. Turns out, there are often exemptions for these   investment clubs, you can read more about it from the SEC site here: [https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html).

There are several issues I find with this response, starting with the first sentence: ""we are currently engaging with regulators to **make a presentation** that what we are offering is not actually securities."" This heavily implies that the SEC has not signed off on what they are doing. So, at this point, not even Lofty knows if the SEC accepts their characterization of their property LLCs as ""investment clubs"".

The next issue - a much bigger one - is that Lofty's reliance on an ""investment club exemption"", for lack of a better term, is extremely flimsy. It is very clear that a platform that presents investment opportunities to the general public is already at odds with the ""spirit"" of an investment club. In essence, investment clubs are private and closed groups of friends or associates who invest collectively. This definition is kind of subjective, but there are also objective criteria that must be met to quality as an investment club, which Lofty's LLCs don't appear to meet. From [SEC.gov](https://sec.gov/):

&gt;To qualify, an investment club:  
&gt;  
&gt;must not make, nor propose to make, a public offering of its securities; and  
&gt;  
&gt;must not have more than 100 members.  
&gt;  
&gt;A public web site or other public communication that could be viewed as   suggesting that a club is looking for new members might be considered a   public offering. An attorney with experience in securities law can help   the club evaluate, based on its particular facts, whether its membership interests are securities and whether the club is making a public offering of those securities.

I am admittedly not sure if any of Lofty's properties have more than 100  investors, but I have to imagine they do with a minimum investment of only $50. Additionally, they make public appeals to join their ""investment clubs"" on their very public website. So, the investment club argument doesn't appear to hold much water.

The other argument I've heard is that Lofty's tokens are not securities because each LLC is essentially an autonomous organization run by its members and not by Lofty. Put another way, Lofty is just a marketplace that allows investors to form self-sufficient investment clubs. If true, this would mean prong 4 of the Howey Test (To be derived from the efforts of others) would not be met, and therefore their offerings would not be securities. The basis for this argument is that Lofty has a governance protocol where token holders make decisions on rental price, optional repairs, etc.

With regards to classification as a security, the fact that token holders can vote on certain decisions does not mean they are not relying on the efforts of others to earn a profit. Lofty's management is absolutely vital to the operation of these LLCs. According to the SEC's *Framework for ""Investment Contract"" Analysis for Digital Assets:*

&gt;When a promoter, sponsor, or other third party (or affiliated groupof third parties) (each, an “Active Participant” or “AP”) provides essential managerial efforts thataffect the success of the enterprise, and investors reasonably expect to derive profit from thoseefforts, then this prong of the test is met

Lofty's management efforts include (but are not limited to):

* The acquisition and/or listing of the property
* The establishment of the LLC and its documentation
* The conversion of membership units to tokens
* Hiring and acting as a point of contact for property managers
* Collecting and distributing rental income
* Preparation of tax documents
* Offering token buy backs, which allows investors to cash out (a major selling point)

It is apparent that Lofty's team provides ""essential managerial efforts"" that allow these property LLCs to run. The idea that these LLCs are autonomous or self-sufficient clubs that do not rely on Lofty's management is a facade and does not hold up to scrutiny. Compare this to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Algorand, which are non-security tokens with true decentralization. These networks would continue to operate even if their developers up and left tomorrow. The do not rely on any central figure to operate at this point, which is why they do not meet the 4th prong of the Howey Test.

If anyone can refute what I've laid out here, I am more than willing to admit I was wrong. I am not a lawyer or an expert on the subject. But based on everything I know, as well as all of the information the SEC provides, Lofty is using flimsy logic to circumvent US securities laws and illegally sell securities to the general public.

29. Wow! The Netherlands arrested the developer of Tornado Cash on Friday (Aug 12). The stakes just got a little higher in crypto.

30. An interesting point has been made that validating blocks in ETH 2.0 that contain Tornado Cash or other sanctioned transactions would be a violation of the sanctions while not validating those blocks can also lead to financial penalties (“inactivity leaking”) in ETH 2.0.

personalfinance,Sudden medical retirement from military,"I'm writing this on mobile, so please excuse any format issues. 

My wife and I are both in our mid 30's, with a total of three kids between our first marriages. Current net worth in retirement accounts is about 375k between her TSP and my combined TSP/401K/Roth IRA. We used to be dual military, but I was medically separated and rated 100% P&amp;T by the VA a few years ago. I got lucky and found remote work, leveraging my documentation skills of all things. My wife's military career has unfortunately met the same fate. She has been medically retired, and rated 40% by the military, and 100% P&amp;T by the VA.

This means we'll get to keep tricare, and won't be eligible for CHAMPVA (VA family Healthcare). The projected monthly cost for a family is about $175/month with an annual $3k catastrophic cap.

Current combined income is about $227k before taxes. We don't have any mortgage or housing costs at the moment, as we live in military housing. 

Our only debt is a car payment. I splurged and bought my wife her dream car (not smart, but a great middle finger to our ex spouses). 1.75% interest rate in the 9% inflation rate era is why I'm only making the minimum, $924/mo payments, for the next 5.5 years. 

Monthly utilities/insurance is about $1050/mo
Monthly groceries is around $900/mo (HCOL area).
Most of the leftover income has been going into i-bonds(50k/yr limit thanks to 5 ssn's)

I'm currently maxing out my 401k, and ESPP. My wife is putting about 10% into her TSP. Our current combined after tax income (including VA) is $11106/month. That's going to change in January, when my wife retires.

We are planning on moving to a MCOL area, where we'll be exempt from property tax. We'll also be receiving $8602/mo from the VA for the rest of our lives (with yearly increases tied to SSA adjustments). This will go up/down as kids go to college and leave the household. 

Neither of us planned for this situation, and all of our retirement funds are setup for us to use in our 60's. The odds of us making it far past our 60's isn't as great as it used to be, especially for me. This has me wanting to enjoy life as much as I can, and maybe retire early. I genuinely enjoy my current job, which is why I'm unlikely to try to leave, even though I'm probably being underpaid (MS in Cybersecurity, cloud exp, $135k/yr)

My wife wants to work after she's out, and her career field in the military doesn't transition well into the civilian sector, unless you go government contractor, in a limited set of locations. She's had job offers in the $90~105k range. 

I'm having difficulty planning out the next 0~25 years for us, and nobody I know is in a similar situation. While I know I'm somewhat fortunate, our bodies paid a heavy price to get here.

Now we will have to move and look into buying a house at a less than great time. Assuming my wife accepts one of the jobs she's been offered, we are looking at a gross income of $330k~360k/yr. While I don't want to be house poor, if I've only got 30 years of life left to live, I would like to live in a nice house. I'm also not sure what my budget for a house should be. Does the traditional 1/3 rule still apply, or should I plan for one or both of us to not be physically capable of working? 

Our other option is to move to a LCOL area, far from family. We'd also be giving up some of the VA benefits, like the free education for the kids, and property tax exemption. The gain is we'd be able to retire early.

I've got about 3 months to figure all of this out.",finance,1662010453

**The Suez Canal was blocked for a short time**

As a German I woke up to these news and was scared to even look at the crypto chart. First thing I see is my German stock market bleeding heavily **again**. I was ready to see a -5% BTC and -10% on alts but … nothing?

I guess after all the coupling with NASDAQ crypto suddenly doesn’t care anymore?

And then I realized something. The last months felt irrational anyway. ETH doing a 2x in a couple weeks while people are still calling new lows coming soon.

Markets pumped on recession and inflation news. The entire markets feel like they are all on crack for the last months reacting heavily to any single word / number coming from the FED.

September is known for being a bad month for markets so… I’ve decided to be bullish. In fact I’m loading up from today till end of next week on crypto until my entire budget is in. Maybe I’m a degenerate but everybody is so bearish lately it wouldn’t surprise me if September ends up like another June rally lol

personalfinance,Are CDs a good option for me?,"I had about $43k sitting in my savings account. Upon reflection, I figured it would be best to start investing it. I started by purchasing $10k in Series I Bonds, so I am capped on that. I opened up a Roth IRA with Fidelity and put $6k in their Fidelity Freedom Index 2060 Fund (FDKLX), so I am capped there as well. I am thinking that I should invest another $10k-$15k. Would a CD be a good option? Bread Savings appears to have good APYs (1 yr - 3%, 2 yr - 3.5%, 3 yr - 3.55%, 4yr - 3.6%, 5 yr - 3.65%). Would a 1-year option be the best? That way I can move $6k of it into my IRA next year. Any help would be appreciated!

*Extra information:* I currently have about $15k in my TSP (military) and actively contribute to it for the matched contribution. I plan to get out of the military, so I will be transferring those (Roth) funds to my new Fidelity Roth IRA when I separate in less than two years. I have another $3k tied up in a Navy Federal CD.

stocks,Don't fight the fed advice,"With so many people trying desperately holding on to any good news lately, remember don't fight the fed and don't fight the trend.

If jobs number is good the fed will take it as a sign there's more room to increase rates. If GDP grows or stagnates they will take it as a sign for manuever.

The Fed was clear they want to fight inflation and will bring pain to the market companies and households for it.

But don't take my word for it take Jerome Powell word:

""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,"" he said. ""These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.""

Even with four consecutive interest rate hikes, including two back-to-back 75-basis-point increases, Powell stressed that the Fed is not in a place to ""stop or pause"" — an unwelcome sign for investors who were predicting a rate cut next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

So next time you see a rally based on jobs numbers or GDP or whatever remember the fed will take it as a sign to keep increasing rates.

Since the Feds raised the rates AND inflation is through the roof, it looks to be a solid decision.  You can't touch the principal at all for the first year and for years two through five, there's an interest penalty for withdrawal.  If inflation ever goes back to zero, that would be the time to withdraw it.  I'm okay with not being able to withdraw either bond.  

However, you can only purchase the bonds through the treasury.gov website and the technology that they use is from like, 20 years ago.  I've read countless comments, disparaging the system for assigning bonds, cashing them in, and plain just not being able to access your account.  However, I never see any comments about the site having issues taking your ten grand per bond.

It seems like a great deal, but why bother if you can't get paid upon maturity and/or access your account to check up on them?  Can anyone give me some personal experience in purchasing these bonds, please?  Or, at least, know some truthful information about these I-bonds?

# [Stock futures fall to start September as market reels on worries of rising rates](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/31/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, the first day of September, as traders continued to fret over the potential for higher Federal Reserve rates.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 143 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves came as the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 3.516%, the highest level since November 2007, at one point Thursday.
*****
&gt; Nvidia shares also contributed to the losses, falling more than 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker said the U.S. government is restricting some sales in China.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off four straight days of losses. On Wednesday, the final day of August, the Dow slid nearly 0.9%. The S&amp;P 500 lost about 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell roughly 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The Dow closed the month down about 4.1%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq recorded losses of 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors are debating whether stocks will again challenge the June lows in September, a historically poor month for markets, after weighing recent hawkish comments from Fed officials who show no signs of easing up on interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “If we retest the lows, I think it happens in September,” SoFi’s Liz Young said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” However, she added, “I think in order to do so, something would have to get materially worse than it was on June 16,” when stocks bottomed, such as earnings revisions that come in worse than investors are expecting.

&gt; **Nvidia (NVDA)** – Nvidia slid 4.3% in the premarket after the graphics chip maker warned it expects a sales hit of as much as $400 million from new U.S. licensing requirements. Those rules will impose restrictions on shipments of its most advanced chips to China. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said some of its chips would be impacted by those new requirements, and its stock fell 2.6% in off-hours trading.

personalfinance,Thoughts on the Tally app?,"Was wondering if anyone has tried it and what are people though on it. In my situation I have 2 credit cards totaling up to about $5k. I am considering it if my understanding is correct, that you get a loan that pays off the credit cards. Then you just have that one loan to pay, but you pay at a lower interest rate then what you would have with both cards combined.",finance,1662040772
personalfinance,Refinancing credit card debt,"Hello,

I'm trying to understand what would be the best way to refinance our household credit card debt.

Right now, between my wife and I, there are 4 credit cards with a total debt of around 4500€, the interest rates for these cards are between 18% and 21%.

The cards are split like this:

&amp;#x200B;

|Card|Balance|Monthly payment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Card 1|650€|125€|
|Card 2|800€|50€|
|Card 3|850€|25€|
|Card 4|2.200€|45€|

&amp;#x200B;

Between the 2 of us we have a monthly payment going towards credit cards of around 250€.

My debt is the Card 1, so I'm thinking to take out a loan of 6k (also to help with a big expense we got in the next months) with my bank for 28 months and an APR of 8.73% to pay out the credit cards and then basically keep the same amount of monthly paying we are currently doing towards one loan instead of different cards with higher interest rates.

I also read about the snowball method and I thought about just paying off Card 2 and Card 3, increase the payment on Card 4 to 125€, and then as soon as I pay off Card 1 (5 months), increase Card 4 to 250€.

This would allow me to pay everything off in 12 months more or less but I would have to go into my savings (I don't feel comfortable doing that) and if my calculation are correct I would save a couple of hundreds over 28 months, would that be worth it?

I consider the loan the best option but I would like some opinions from you guys.

Thank you",finance,1662043539

stocks,How do you use economic data to inform your trades?,"Most traders know all about the effect of Fed news on price action whether that is with data drops like CPI,  PPI, housing sales, or something else. But that's a common place for traders to end their relationship with economic data-  Papa Powell just means volatility.

But what if you could take advantage of the various data to inform your trading?

You see, each set of data reveals new details into the story of the economy and we can use this data as traders to position ourselves in an advantageous way, enjoying longer trends and resistance to pulldowns (with thanks to staying power).

# The Market is a River You Endure

Imagine someone who enjoys white-water rafting. This is someone who sits on a raft and uses their paddle to influence their direction as they make their way down a river. White-water rafting is pretty simple, really, but that doesn't mean it's always easy. In fact there are *six class of white water,* each one more dangerous than the next. Class 1 and 2 are for floating and soaking in nature while Class 4 is an aggressive adventure (and Class 6 represents extreme danger, taking the lives of some of the most experienced athletes).

And here's the thing: *Regardless of the class of white-water, the rafter always has the same paddle.* *But that paddle doesn't influence their direction as much with more aggressive waters.* The more difficult the water the more strategy, planning, experience, and fitness are required to traverse the river. Sound familiar?

Strategy... Planning... Experience... Fitness (Capital)

# The Problem

**Now back to trading:**

We've all heard the statistic: 95% of traders don't prosper long term. There's lots of reasons why this might have some merit, but one of them is traders not fully understanding the market in which they paddle. The river is going to take you where it wants. *You can only maneuver between the rocks.*

Imagine not knowing which class of water you're about to carve through? Class 6 will rip your arms off. And I'm telling you right now that this right here is a good analogy for a trader who completely ignores economic catalysts and overall trends.

Traders like you and me can benefit from understanding which ""class"" of market they are in. There are times when volatility is low and times where it is high. Even worse, there are times when volatility is \*impending\* and traders don't know what is going to happen. Which brings us to the point of this post:

# Economic Data Drops: How to Take Advantage

Let's start with some data that is applicable today.

Non-farm Payrolls and Unemployment data **comes out tomorrow (September 2nd, 2022)**. This represents one of the most important pieces of economic data. Period. This happens every first-Friday of the month. I'd argue it is even more important during this season of inflation and supply issues.

I'm going to use a lot of super great explanations from Graeme Watkins, CEO of Valutrades Limited (of which I have no affiliation), to illustrate how day traders can benefit from digesting this kind of information.

**What advantages does Non-Farm Payroll data offer traders?**

# Advantage #1: Find Volume and Volatility

Just knowing the date of these drops helps **identify volume and volatility shifts**. After the report hits tomorrow before open, you'll notice a rise in market activity. Having a handy economic calendar for significant news helps traders game plan for a high volatility environment.

We've all been there. You do your research. You have a plan. You're ready to go... And then... ""Wtf was that?! You seeing this volume?!"" That never actually goes away completely (lol, life) but you can prevent surprises and game plan differently by knowing when these data drops occur.

I love this app for economic calendar (again, no affiliation).

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trading-economics/id1142178921](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trading-economics/id1142178921)

# Advantage #2: Find Momentum Sectors and Hot Stocks Early

Most traders are late to a trend and find just a fraction of a run to take advantage of, missing a huge chunk of the whole move. What if you could capture the lion's share of it instead of a tiny slice?

Well, traders can **identify momentum sectors and hot stocks early** with thanks to a (somewhat) predictable market rotation from NFP data. And of course momentum can present clean trends for larger profits and safety against pullbacks.

How?

Well, to be overly simple, changing rates affect business decisions, manufacturing, and distribution. These changes in business operations have a butterfly affect of sorts that represent headwinds and tailwinds for affiliated industries. This is provided by the guts of the NFP data which is that that we get to learn about the ""total number of paid U.S. workers of any registered business; exclusions to this figure include private household employees, employees of nonprofit organizations, general government employees, and—as you can probably already gather—farm employees.""

**Notable tickers to watch** during the data drop: DXY, USD/EUR, VIX.

# Advantage #3: Leverage Group-think Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

We all know trading is a *psychological jungle.* Wouldn't it be nice to have a bead on the general sentiment in the market? **Being aware of current trends and ""group-think"" offers an enormous edge**. Take advantage of the psychological aspect of the market. Because you see...

&gt;""When jobs are increasing in number, sentiment within the market generates momentum, with consumers having more disposable income and, thus, spending more... An increase in user spending has always been a factor behind USD performance, even if its impact is often understated.""

*Side note: With this quoted, it should be known that right now* ***good news is bad news*** *since the labor market and spending is part of the reason inflation is still white hot. But that's another chat for another time, one that I am sure would be an energetic conversation.*

When traders are aware of shifts in sentiment or socially trending topics, they can find where volume and volatility are, representing opportunities for profit. And if they understand the data, they can make smart choices on their strategies as it relates to direction and risk/reward evaluations.

**Tracking Social Sentiment Manually**

There are cool websites that track keyword mentions across the internet. Watch how the words ""unemployment, inflation, and recession"" spike after the data drop tomorrow. I like this one (no affiliation): [https://www.wordtracker.com/search?query=recession](https://www.wordtracker.com/search?query=recession)

# What about you?

These are just a few quick ways that I feel traders can benefit from watching and digesting financial data. If you'd like to learn more about the impacts of financial data like this, I have some resources I'm happy to share, but I'd like to hear from everyone else. Tell us your magic sauce.

stocks,Should I go to an all cash portfolio?,"So, I (31 yo) inherited a rather large portfolio from a family member about 2 years ago (currently $1.1m). It's invested at about 60/40 ETFs/mutual funds. As we are all aware, the markets have been exceptionally volatile, and I believe that we're going to see a steady slide/decline into a recession (at the very least) over the next year or so due to the Fed's guidance, continued inflation, loss of trust in the government (with regards to changing recession definitions), etc. 

With that being said, I am obviously very interested in maintaining the value of the portfolio, and reinvesting the cash once we see a significant decline in the market (id assume around 6-12 months). However, total average gain for the portfolio is around 15%. My assumption is that I'd end up paying capital gains on that 15%. My questions for you guys are:

1) would you recommend that I cash out and reinvest once the market has dropped into recession territory?

2) would I end up paying a huge chunk in taxes if I did this? And if so, is there any way to reduce/remove my tax liability?

CryptoCurrency,Understanding Recent News About the Current Status of a U.S. CBDC,"Lately, there has been a ton of news and information floating around about a U.S. CBDC and different projects or pilots being rolled out. As many know in March President Biden signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) that required various government agencies to work together to create a unified roadmap for cryptocurrency policy. This announcement brought renewed focus to the Federal Reserve and the possible creation of a CBDC. In the months since several projects and pilots have been announced or started, however, there is only one that actually involves the Federal Reserve/Government and this project initially started in [August of 2020](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/press-releases/2020/the-federal-reserve-bank-of-boston-announces-collaboration-with-mit-to-research-digital-currency.aspx) and has been ongoing ever since. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are currently [two projects](https://forkast.news/headlines/digital-dollar-project-ripple-cbdc-sandbox/) operating to ""test"" CBDC. These projects are not government affiliated and involve a company and a nonprofit partnering together. The first one emerged in April when the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation partnered with the Digital Dollar Project and launched Project Lithium. Yesterday, another one was announced with Ripple also partnering with the Digital Dollar Project to launch a [technical sandbox program](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/01/digital-dollar-project-plans-to-explore-cbdc-technical-solutions-with-new-sandbox/) to further study a CBDC. What comes out of these programs and what important data they claim to gather should be taken with a grain of salt because they do not involve the very authorities who would launch a CBDC in the first place. The Federal Reserve could easily dismiss these findings. 

&amp;#x200B;

The one project that people in the crypto/blockchain space should pay attention to is the Boston Federal Reserve's project with MIT The Hamilton Project. In February the Fed released an [update](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/project-hamilton-phase-1-executive-summary.aspx#20cfcd8d-c994-477e-bb57-7e49f291b155) on the Hamilton Project which announced the results of Phase One of the project. Phase One covered the design and sustainability of if this sort of project was launched and if it would even be better than the system that the U.S. already has in place. This release also coincided with the project moving to Phase Two. In this phase, the project will be looking at new functionality and alternative technical designs. The research topics that will be covered cast a wide range of areas and will target some critical things like offline payments and protection against denial of service attacks. While these areas are critical for the system to actually function in the crypto community research into cryptographic designs for privacy AND audibility will likely occur. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving forward I am sure we will continue to hear about the U.S. moving towards deploying a CBDC however with how the current system functions, with the Federal Reserve in charge, the U.S. is quite a ways away from deployment. A ton of steps will need to take place like pilot studies and evaluating the results making the necessary changes and then trying again. While other governments have looked at the possibility of building atop another built-out blockchain the U.S. is going to build its own from scratch and something like that just takes time. If and when the Fed decides to launch a CBDC even among themselves they will have to sort things out. In August one of the Federal Reserve Governors, [Michelle Bowman](https://www.coinspeaker.com/federal-reserve-fednow-cbdc/) spoke about the central bank's work. When asked about a CBDC she instead advocated for a program called FedNow instead of a CBDC. FedNow enables financial institutions of any size across America to provide safe and efficient instant payment services. According to her, this program would solve the underlying issues that have led people to call for a U.S. CBDC. 

&amp;#x200B;

With how quickly FUD can spread I wanted to put this together since I have seen an increase in the number of articles online about the U.S. developing and deploying a CBDC. I hope this allows you to see where in the process we are and how much further we would need to get to even be able to pull this off!",cryptocurrency,1662050723

personalfinance,how to finance new hvac?,"Hello, I am a homeowner in the midwest US. This week my 23 year old ac unit finally bit the dust (had this confirmed by my friend who is an hvac tech). I do not now and will not any time soon have the funds for replacement with cash. I have an extremely tight budget and am falling behind due to inflation as it is, and it is all I can do to stay on top of my credit card debt, so I am really not wanting to add more credit card debt even though I am currently not paying interest and have not reached my limit. I have 8 months until the promotional 0% rate ends for me to either pay it off or transfer the balance, and my confidence in my ability to pay it off completely by then is pretty low at this point. 

I am thinking of using a fixed rate heloc or home equity loan to finance a new ac and furnace. Traditional helocs kind of scare me because of the variable rate, and because my budget is so extremely tight I need something long term and predictable. The one good thing I have going for me is a lot of equity in my home (about 120k) and a good credit score (770). I have 8k in credit card debt and a car loan that I owe 2k on. 

So basically I'm wanting to leverage my equity to pay for this new hvac unit in a way that won't overextend me financially and allow me to still continue chipping away at my credit card debt. I'm not sure the best way to go about that, and I'm worried about the further strain that inflation and higher interest rates could put on me and possibly land me in an untenable situation.

CryptoCurrency,What it really means when we have the ability to take the IRS to court when they get info about our crypto use,"So a few have seen the "" **Taxpayers can take the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to federal court for gathering private financial information about his use of virtual currency from third-party exchanges without a lawful subpoena** ""

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell, basically we can take the IRS to court if the use an unlawful subpoena to get info about us.

# Problems

# * There is a pretty good chance you will NEVER know this was done. 

Like unless if they use it against you in an audit or some way. Like they might audit you to try to find a link. Where they know what you did, but they are trying to find some legal way to prove it.

&amp;#x200B;

# * Many times companies get what is called an information request. 

Sometimes they are legally you will give us x. But a lot of time it is them asking for info but if you don't get it then it's OK. The problem is, many companies give the information. 

Like with this. lets say you trade on Coinbase and move the crypto off platform or do whatever. The IRS can give a simple request, and it's up to Coinbase to give that info or not. If they do, then it was freely given. If not, then no harm in asking.

&amp;#x200B;

# * Another major way gov bodies get info is by buying it.

Like ISP do this all the time where they flat out sell user data. The buyer could be an ad company or maybe the gov. This means the IRS could simply work a business deal with the exchanges to collect info. 

# * Another way that is used with other things like FBI is other countries. 

Basically, it is illegal to spy on our own citizens without the proper paperwork. HOWEVER, the country can spy all day long on other citizens in most other counties. Countries with similar laws they work deals with us where we spy on their citizen and they spy on ours. On paper, no law has been broken and no warrant or anything needed.

&amp;#x200B;

# * The last way is data collection programs in intelligent communities. For example PRISM

&gt; PRISM is a tool used by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to collect private electronic data belonging to users of major internet services like Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, and others. It’s the latest evolution of the US government’s post-9/11 electronic surveillance efforts, which began under President Bush with the Patriot Act, and expanded to include the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) enacted in 2006 and 2007.   
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet)

&amp;#x200B;

IDK if PRISM is still around, but there is a TON of multiple monitoring programs now so its all rather convoluted

* What has changed is that the NSA was challenged on using PRISM and other method for bulk collection and storage of data in the US
* That has been stopped (it was stopped many years ago) so bulk collection no longer happens in the US
* Now court order must be issued before the NSA can actively monitor you. 
* If you are a criminal then beware that getting a court order in the US is so trivial that it is practically issued automatically

So on paper bulk data collection stopped, but it is still going. There is so many of these court orders and virtually none of them get rejected and they get approved so fast that it's bulk collection but with extra steps.

And you will never know if they got one of these orders against you. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I say there is so many of these request and orders. Apple, Google, and Facebook people complain about it all the time. Where they will get hundreds to thousands per day at week. During given events this can be per day.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR

Unless if they flat out admit it or they start taking you to court and you have a lawyer trying to figure out how they figured out what about you and if it was legal. You will never know

1. what the IRS knows about you
2. what they will use with that knowledge
3. when they find out about it
4. what false info they know about you (like screwed up data or putting the wrong 2 and 2 together)

I’m considering buy a home very soon, but I often wonder will the housing market crash? 

Foreclosure rates are up 150% YOY but that’s only because of the extreme low rates of last year. Mainly due to the foreclosure moratorium along with a ton of other government supplements. The foreclosure rate is still not at 2019 Pre pandemic levels. 

An argument I hear often is that “the housing market can’t crash because there’s low supply”. I’d argue the only reason supply is stretched so thin is because of programs like, deferred student loan, deferred mortgage payments, deferred car payments, low interest rates, etc. Under these conditions I’m sure you would easily afford your lifestyle, what happens when these programs expire? 

Another argument I hear is  “well the unemployment rate is at a all time low” keep in mind unemployment is a lagging indicator, it’s funny because right before every single recession we’ve had “all time low unemployment”.

I haven't really had a real strategy, so now I want to establish one.

solana,Imagine you only paid for the seconds you watched on Netflix.,"If the world is running on pay cycles, imagine if the movement of money was continuous. Zebec is spearheading the evolution of how money is moved on the blockchain, creating the model for the future of on-chain payments. They aim to enable a real-time world where everyone is getting paid, so you are not relying on payment lending.

This evolution of pay cycles will evolve the concept of credit as well. Your pay cycle will be how many cents you earn every second and how many cents you can pay back your debt. Your interest rate will go down because you’re more reliable to lenders. The payee receives their money faster, compounding their cash faster while their interest rates decrease.

Right now, Zebec is focusing on payments, but over time it will open up to charges outside of payroll to subscriptions and other markets. Zebec has also created ZAApps, a fully functional one-stop app store for DeFi projects on Solana.",cryptocurrency,1662069492

Some stats about our financial info.

My wife is currently working towards her PhD to be completed in May of 2023. She has her JD in law but has not passed the bar. She has attempted the bar two times and didn't pass so she decided to go and finish up her engineering degree. As you may have guessed a lot of student loan debt has been accrued up until this point. The principal still owed is  $279,537.79 at a 7% interest rate.  She is currently temporarily employed making 52k. 

I have completed my bachelor's in Psychology, but haven't had any luck finding a job in my field. I went to attempt my Master's Degree in Psychology but the program was not a good fit so I left the program before I accrued any more student loan debt. However, at this point, I am struggling to find a job around here that needs just a bachelor's, so I have begun to teach myself web development since I minored in CIS. I have accrued 70k debt in student loans over the course of my life. 

Up until this point we have been renting. However, we live in Oklahoma and have had 3 slumlords back to back with no recourse. My wife has always wanted to own her own land/home so we have been looking for a home loan. I know that renting is usually ideal in situations like this, but is there a way to make buying a home reasonable in this situation? We have had mortgage loans offered to us at 75k with no down, and have filled out applications at a mobile home place as well and waiting to hear responses from them and other mortgage places. 

Also, how can we begin to get a plan in place to start saving for our future, and should we seek out a financial advisor in this situation? Thanks in advance!",finance,1662072744

I went through a nasty divorce 3 years ago and I'm just now doing well mentally and picking up the financial pieces. I'm quickly approaching 30 and with all the things I've missed out on due to bad financial/personal decisions in my 20s, I really want to get out from under this crushing debt and be financially stable by then.

Income: $622 average take home pay weekly after deductions and 401k loan payments that come out of my check. I receive $200 every other week from my partner for rent. Total monthly income: $2,888

Expenses: including rent, utilities, minimum debt payments and my cash budget for necessities and sinking funds $2863

Debt is currently $31,554.58 across loans and credit cards.

Savings: $516.47 ($10 automatically taken from each check)

I can list my specific debt amounts and my expense breakdown in the comments below if that would be more helpful.

I have reviewed my monthly spending to get down to a zero based cash budget for gas, groceries, prescriptions and medical expenses, as well as sinking funds like property taxes, car maintenance, clothes, Christmas, etc. I feel while it is bare bones, it is doable for me.

Additionally, I recently got hired for a 2nd job on nights and weekends and expect to earn a minimum of $500 extra a month.

My plan of action is to use my 2nd income to get my savings to $2k while paying my debts at minimum payments and not adding any debt to existing cards, and then start tackling my debt, starting with credit cards from low to high, then do the same with my loans because they have lowest interest rates. When I free up each minimum payment, I plan to move that payment on to the next highest debt to pay it off through the snowball method. I understand that it may cost me more interest, but it will greatly help me with my cash flow situation.

I have looked at every way to cut my budget further, but I don't think it's possible without eating ramen for every meal or moving in with my parents. Any advice or words of wisdom are greatly appreciated.",finance,1662081345

An interesting point has been made that validating blocks in ETH 2.0 that contain Tornado Cash or other sanctioned transactions would be a violation of the sanctions while not validating those blocks can also lead to financial penalties (“inactivity leaking”) in ETH 2.0.

personalfinance,Taking a variable rate loan for ease of mind,"I want to take a personal loan to pay off my CC debt… I have two options: 7% variable APR or 7% fixed APR. Now the choice would be obvious to anyone in these times… And I know full well that the interest rate will rise, even substantially. Now here’s the dilemma:
With the variable rate loan, I can repay any amount of the principal whenever I want without any fees or penalties. The remaining balance will be spread out on the original term length. And I can do that anytime within the website or the app.
With the fixed rate loan I will have to pay fees and penalties EVERYTIME i want to make some extra payments. Plus there’s no option to do it online, you have to call customer service.
Also, I’ve made some calculations on Excel. We’re not talking about a massive loan (10k). So even if for some reason the interest rate goes up by 20% (very unlikely) with a 0.75 hike every 3 months, I will pay in total less than 1k more interest than if I took the fixed rate loan. My term length is 3 years so ~$300 more a year doesn’t seem so awful.

I know we're all tired of hearing about The Merge all day long, but most people have been focused on the monetary policy changes, i.e. the ""triple halving"".  What I'd like to turn your attention to is narrative.

While price may drive narrative for participants in this space, mainstream narrative is what dictates the rate at which new participants enter the space. Once the Merge takes effect, Ethereum will consume at least [99% less energy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/29/cryptocurrency-ethereum-plans-to-cut-carbon-emissions-by-99-per-cent-with-upgrade). Considering the impending energy crisis the Euro zone will surely face by EOY, this could drive Ethereum and other PoS networks to outperform PoW ones.

It's true that the current macro-economic state of the world doesn't favor risk-on assets, but if we really are in for a lost decade or even a major recession, I think that could make some people lose faith in traditionnal finance and be more willing to explore alternatives.

investing,"Economy adds 315,000 jobs in August despite slowing economy, mounting recession fears. Unemployment rises to 3.7%.","Hiring slowed sharply in August but remained sturdy as employers added 315,000 jobs despite softer consumer spending gains, rising interest rates and a sputtering economy.

The unemployment rate rose from 3.5% to 3.7%, the Labor Department said Friday.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that 300,000 jobs were added last month.

Many experts reckoned August finally would mark the start of a slowdown in payroll growth after the U.S. recovered all 22 million jobs wiped out in the pandemic the prior month. So far this year, the labor market has averaged more than 450,000 monthly payroll gains, shrugging off a shrinking economy, soaring inflation, and mounting recession fears.

Persistent labor shortages have made many companies reluctant to cut staffers and even encouraged some firms to bring on workers they don’t need in the current wobbly economy with an eye toward an eventual rebound.

And some industries, like restaurants and bars, are still well below their pre-COVID employment levels and struggling to catch up as Americans resume dining out, traveling and other activities in larger numbers. For now, the robust job numbers mean more household income and spending, insulating the economy from a recession, at least in the short term.

But most employees who were laid off in spring 2020 have been rehired, leaving less space for outsize employment gains. Also, aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to fight inflation have been expected to eventually dampen business hiring and investment.

Moody’s Analytics predicts payroll advances will slow to about 100,000 a month by the end of the year. Some economists are forecasting a recession by the middle of 2023.",finance,1662122924

investing,T-Bills at 3% on Vanguard. The current market earnings situation.,"Even at these seemingly depressed levels (note: depressed from one of the fastest, most hysteric market runups ever), I still find the market to be on the higher end of fair value. TTM PE is finally touching below 20, but this is in the wake of extremely fast growth in earnings over the past couple years.

I'm not going to take the silly approach of counting our current growth starting conveniently at the catastrophically depressed levels of covid. Pre-covid, we were looking at about $160 eps on the S&amp;P at the start of 2020. Now we're at just a tad over $200. So you're talking 25% real growth in about 2.5 years, or about 10% real growth per year.

While the current growth number is fantastic just on its face, I hardly see it as sustainable, nor do I want to participate in pricing shares according to such unsustainable growth levels. However, it seems the market is finally turning *away* from pricing in growth, thanks to the fed. Now, despite the current price ratios becoming depressed due to upside earnings volatility, do I think it's foolish to buy in here? Absolutely not. I just don't particularly think it's time for a *heavy* allocation. I like to refer to Graham's counsel in the early 70s, since the bond/stock situation seems somewhat similar, albeit the numbers are different.

&gt;The major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on first-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since been a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 7 1⁄2% and even more against 4 1⁄2% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend return on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the market decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is less than 3.5%...

During that time, you had a high grade corporate bond yield of 7.5% against a dividend yield of 3.5% on stocks, with bonds yielding over twice what stocks did. Now, you've got a stock yield of 1.5% against a 20y corporate AAA rate of 4.5%, or *triple* the yield of stocks. Even T-bills themselves, currently at 3%, are doubling stock yields. Graham's 50-50 counsel in that particular bond-stock situation in the early 70s appears therefore a heavier allocation toward stocks than what would be prudent at current levels, given that the bond yield:stock yield ratio is currently substantially more in favor of bonds.

But why would I say this, with the *current* growth rate of stocks being what it is? Well it's just that word -- current. Real earnings growth in the past 3 years has exploded when compared to the more smoothed growth rate over a longer time period of, say, the past 10 years. From 2012-2022, earnings have risen 112 --&gt; 204 eps. This is just a tad over a 6%/yr real rate of growth (mind you, the *price growth* of the S&amp;P over the same time period has been well over double that). Again, for this 3 year period we are currently in, we've seen something closer to 10% real growth. While in theory this is a fantastic development for those *already in* stocks, it spells caution for those *looking to enter into stocks* right at the present moment, since these periods of explosive growth are likely to be tempered by a following period of lower growth.

While the typical counsel for those in their younger years is an all-in equity approach, I think the current situation does present at least a reasonable case for consideration of a more balanced approach. At least until equities are at substantively cheaper valuations, and while short term risk free rates remain as high as they currently are (as of today, 3% on 3 month T bills), Graham's 50-50 approach seems still a prudent approach to today's current market environment. Given that the average yearly earnings of the S&amp;P over the past decade is 156 eps, an S&amp;P level of around 3120 could be considered a reasonable allocation changer (say, 50% to 75%) for a more value-inclined investor. 2340 would be the level for the die-hard Shiller believers. I find it also a strange coincidence that the Shiller level is within a few % of where the covid market bottomed out, but that is a digression.

For the most extremely conservative among us, especially those in retirement, a case could also be made even for a 25/75 portfolio. It's also worth noting that there is optionality here. With current treasury rates providing relatively little extra % yield for additional time commited, staying in the T bill range (1-3 months) allows an investor to potentially change allocations on a quarterly (even up to a monthly) basis, if stock prices happen to substantially change.",finance,1662139022

personalfinance,What percentage should I contribute to my company's Simple IRA?,"(22M) - I just graduated from college in may and got a job making 60k salary. I have 28k out in federal loans(18k if the 10k forgiveness goes through) and owe 10k on my car at 5%, however I have 21k in savings for when the 0% interest on my loan goes away at the end of this year. My monthly expenses come out to $500, low as I am currently living at home with my parents. After taxes I make $3900 a month. I also have 8k in a Roth IRA and plan to put in the 6k contribution cap each year.

My employer is offering a Simple IRA with 3% match, I know I am going to without a doubt contribute the 3% to get the match(can't turn down free money). My question is does it make sense to try to max out the contribution on this account as well? I was think of contributing between 7-12% putting me at 10-15% or $6000-$9000 per year.

gaming,I talked a father out of getting a video game that his young kid wanted at a game shop. That kid is gonna remember me for life.,"Context: The dude was there with his kid who wanted Kirby Star Allies. I decided to stick my nose in and recommended Kirby and the Forgotten Land instead, which I consider to be the superior Kirby game on the Switch. Anyway I later learned that the kid had ALREADY played Forgotten Land but in talking it up I must have talked down on Star Allies enough to put off the dad from buying it. So in the end, the kid ended with nothing.

Edit: Yeah I totally recognise I effed up there and believe me I do feel bad for the kid about it. I just thought of helping out a fellow dad. Just didn't expect things to end up the way they did. And to be clear I didn't say Star Allies is bad or anything. I just said I think *this* other game is so much better and how much my own kid preferred it.",technology,1662142770
personalfinance,Business is telling me that credit card companies are charging 3% surcharge direct to consumer and wants cash payment instead - this is fake right?,"I had some work done on my car at my local mechanic. I've used them before with no issues in the past. Generally I drop off the car, and they call me with the diagnosis and estimated costs to get a green light to do the work. Then when it's complete, they call with the final bill and any notes. 

This time, when they called to let me know the final cost, the mechanic told me ""just a heads up, if you plan to pay with a credit card, the credit card companies are charging a 3% surcharge directly to customer now. It's not a charge that we, the business, are putting on there. In the past they used to charge it to us, but now in New Jersey, they are changing the rules and credit card companies are charging the customer the fee directly"" 

He asked for a cash payment instead to avoid the charge, but said they'd still accept the CC if I wanted to pay that way. This sounded like total BS to me, and a cursory google turned up nothing about this. If anything, failing to disclose the surcharge prior to doing the work may run afoul of New Jersey's credit card surcharge rules. I assume this is a move to avoid the shop from having to pay a fee/eat the cost. 

I can pay in cash, and though I'd be missing out on my 1% cash back, its not that big of a deal (total was \~$360). I mostly want to know if I'm being fed a line by my trusted mechanic since that would lead me to be skeptical of his other business practices and seek a new mechanic. He does good work at a fair price so I don't want to go mechanic shopping again if I've just jumped to conclusions, but I have to say my BS alarm is going off.

personalfinance,"Do I do Baby Steps in order or survive until I graduate, land a job, and start Baby Steps again? TL;DR at the bottom","I first discovered Dave Ramsey through the radio in 2007 hearing it when I was picked up from school. I slowly started to understand people calling in for advice. Around 2017 is when I started to take Dave Ramsey’s advice to heart especially with student loans. Without that advice, my undergraduate student loans would be in the back burner.

In 2018, I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering Technology with $26K in student loans, credit cards, and other debt. My first job was with the electrical distribution department at one of the steel mills where I lived with e the salary of $63K. I was gracious of living with my parents during school and work. I started from July 2018 to February 2019 fully paying all of it off being done with Baby Step 2. Then, I took out an auto loan for $16.1K in July 2019 for my Subaru before I moved west for another job opportunity as a power field engineer paying $68K. I paid that off in February 2020 and moved on to Baby Step 3. 

Then in March 2020, I accomplished Baby Step 3 with 6 months of expenses. I would have been evicted from my apartment if I have not accomplished Baby Step 3 because in the back of mind I’m used to having emergencies happening and figured I would have the means to head on. 

COVID-19 hit and I was laid off. I could not find a job and have tried every method but got the impression I will never be good enough for the position I was made to do.  I did Shipt during the last 6 months to keep my busy and not feeling the pain from my arms to hanging in there during these uncertain times. In addition, I took a month-long temporary position for near where my parents lived as an Electrical Engineer at an electrical contractor that did work for my department when I started working after graduating with my BS. The yearly salary would have been $70K. Based on how well I did so far, I had the impression that I can finally get back on my feet after being laid off. Then two weeks later I was laid off and head back home west to my apartment.

I continued with the job searching and Shipt and grew tired to where I decided to move forward with graduate school and hope with earning a MSEE, passing the PE (professional engineer) and CAPM (certified associate in project management), all of the chaos would be over. Additionally, what I would have would be future-proof where not a pandemic, an economic instability episode, ultra-low leadership, or anything that would not devastate up everything I worked hard for after losing what I had before the covid pandemic.

I decided to move back home to my parents for graduate school in August when my apartment lease was up. 2 years later, I am in my second to last semester of graduate school with a 3.3 GPA, passing both exams I mentioned in the last paragraph, and had to take classes outside my degree program for university requirement and have my education meet NCEES’ education standard for engineering licensing everywhere.  I plan on graduating in May 2023 with a MS in Electrical Engineering.


Now to where I am at now. 


Hearing about what covid showing the true colors of people, pressure from engineering school, well-being of society and the country, and all of the constant mishaps this year.  This includes getting hit in a car accident (not my fault), step-grandfather passing away, getting Covid after visiting London, not doing well in Spring ’22 semester, and the fear of those “rare” mishaps that will happen in the future.

This have developed distractions that led me to making unhealthy financial decisions using my credit card as a weapon against myself. This consisted of being distracted and obsessed with buying things such as collectables that bring me joy and refuse to sell fearing it might go up in value. I have also used my credit card to where it solves problems without messing everything in my sensitive schedule. An example is leaving London after a weekend vacation. An embargo was placed the day we were supposed to leave where our family (flying standby) cannot leave London because of instability at Heathrow Airport. I said screw this and paid for a ticket back home because there are animals at the house (including my cat) that need to be taken care of. Plus I was interning at an engineering firm at the time and do not get paid time-off.

I had a 401k but never resorted to touching that because of the consequences but smaller investment accounts I have touched all to fund those unhealthy financial decisions. I also did internships during my graduate school career but all went to required (bills) and unhealthy financial decisions.

This led me taking out a personal loan to pay off the credit cards that will annihilate me with high interest rates. To this day I still have those two credit cards open with balances low but existing because I am inclined to believe that it will be needed in case of an emergency (such as flying out ASAP to visit my dying loved one) or required expenses with no compunction of where I am at in my crazy and pressurized life.

To put it that way, I’ve lost my way and have free-fallen back to my unhealthy old ways and the me from 2018 &amp; 2019 would be disappointed in me. I could not be more shameful of where I am at right now.

Two months ago, I decided to return to Dave Ramsey’s podcast in hopes I can regain the energy I had in 2018 &amp; 2019 way before chaos hit the earth. I had accomplished Baby Step 1 but that went towards Baby Step 2 therefore not following the steps in order to clean up the hurricane of a mess I made. I tried to stay committed to this community myself or I would have a high probability to make my financial decisions worse. My shovel is small because I have a certain GPA to meet where I would have to do reduced working hours without getting dropped. Also, no scholarships and no funding unless I go into research.


Now comes the question I ask you in the subreddit or a WWDD (What Would Dave Do?)

Do I continue with baby steps and do them in order starting from Baby Step 1 and then moving on to Baby Step 2 or just survive for 9 months of finishing up school until I start a new job after graduation and do the baby steps then?


TL;DR: Dave Ramsey listener since 2018. Paid off student loans and car. Pandemic hit. Job loss and loss of stable finances. Only option was grad school. Pressure from engineering school, true color of people, and well-being cause me to free-fall. Made unhealthy financial decisions. Took out from smaller investments to pay also on top of pay from internships during grad school. Get back on saddle with Ramsey Show. Did BS1 but went towards mess of BS2. Do I start again with Baby Steps in order starting with 1 or survive until I graduate and land a job.",finance,1662145883

This has resulted in several very expensive added on costs to solar projects.

personalfinance,Need some advice about debt and potential consolidation,"Straight to the point, I have about $58k in credit card debt. Never late on payments, just let it build up paying minimums instead of doing better. I make plenty of money now and the interest rates are pretty high and climbing as rates go up. I was modeling paying them off myself over time vs a personal loan for debt consolidation. Looking at the rates for personal loans on Credit Karma, the interest rates are like half or so. Well, aside from one card that has a lower interest rate. 

Anyway, it seems like a better solution to pay less interest and pay in full each month going forward. The beauty is I think a 3 year loan payments would be like half my fun money per month, so I shouldn’t have any problems with it, and sticking to the plan. 

Thoughts? Should I go for it and reclaim my credit this coming week? It would feel good, that’s for sure. I just have to make sure I stick to the plan and only pay in full going forward.",finance,1662150312

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 5th, 2022.

# **Major stock averages slide for third week, Nasdaq posts six-day losing streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-august-jobs-report-due-friday.html)**
*****
&gt; U.S. equities fell on Friday to cap their third straight weekly decline, after a solid August jobs report failed to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would keep aggressively hiking interest rates to fight inflation.
*****
&gt; After rallying through the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 370-point gain and finished the session lower by 337.98 points, or about 1.1%, at 31,318.44. The S&amp;P 500 fell roughly 1.1% to 3,924.26, its lowest close since July. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.3% to 11,630.86, recording its first six-day losing streak since 2019.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages were lower to end the week, making it their third negative week in a row after slumping in the final days of August. The Dow and S&amp;P lost roughly 3% and 3.3%, respectively, while the Nasdaq fell 4.2%.
*****
&gt; “There’s still a lot of nervousness around what we’ll see over the next few months,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. “Yes, inflation and the job market are coming back into balance, but at what cost? Markets are still figuring that out.”
*****
&gt; “To make matters worse, the S&amp;P 500 is trapped in the danger zone – below its three big moving averages,” she added. “Those moving averages served as floors up until a few weeks ago. Now, they seem to be ceilings that the index just can’t bust through. The mood has definitely changed. While we may not test the lows of this sell-off again, we also may not reach new highs any time soon.”
*****
&gt; Stocks had been weighed down throughout this week by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that interest rate hikes aren’t going away anytime soon. That’s put traders on watch for a retest of the June lows, especially knowing September is historically a poor month for the market. Some have suggested that if the S&amp;P 500 fails to hold the 3,900 level, those summer lows could come back into play.
*****
&gt; Some investors were briefly comforted on Friday by the highly anticipated jobs report, which showed the economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, just under the Dow Jones estimate for 318,000. Stocks rallied in the first part of the day.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, two-tenths of a percentage point higher than expectations. The August report is particularly important because it’s one of the last major economic reports the Fed will weigh before it raises rates at its September meeting. This data point could help the central bank determine whether a 75-basis-point hike.
*****
&gt; The last major economic report of note is August CPI on Sept. 13 and is more likely to determine how aggressive the Fed needs to be in the near term.

&gt; # Weakness on Tuesday After Labor Day – DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight

&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.03% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.30%. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.29%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.26%.

&gt; # Bears Back Above 50%

&gt; In the wake of Jackson Hole and more hawkish than previously expected Fedspeak, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for its worst week since June. As a result, recent improvements in investor optimism have been entirely given back. The AAII survey of individual investors saw only 21.9% of respondents report as bullish this week. That is the worst reading in two months as the back-to-back declines over the past two weeks total 11.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; That was matched with a considerable increase in bearish responses. For the first time since early July, over half of respondents reported a pessimistic outlook for equities. Bearish sentiment's eight percentage point week-over-week increase was the largest since mid-June and the third weekly increase in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves of bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to quickly move down to the worst level since the start of July. That follows a string of readings only a couple of weeks ago in which bears outnumbered bulls by only single digits.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-3.png))**

&gt; Given the reversal in the spread, the streak of negative readings presses on. Now at 22 weeks long, it ties the 1990 streak for the second longest on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-5.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showcasing a much more pessimistic tone of investors. Both the NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence survey also pivoted to more bearish readings. Combining these three results, the average reading on sentiment has fallen back to more than one standard deviation below the historical norm. Although that is not as pessimistic of an aggregate sentiment reading as earlier this year, there have only been a handful of other times going back to the mid-2000s in which the investment community had as negative of an outlook towards the equity market.

&gt; # August Declines All Around the World

&gt; The end of August is here and US equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY), have been on a wild ride. At the mid-month high, SPY was sitting on a 4.3% month-to-date gain, but that has more than entirely been erased as it is on pace to finish the month down closer to 3.5%. The country ETF of each other major global economy that we track in our Global Macro Dashboard is a similar story. Across these countries, on average, they had reached a 3.13% gain at their month-to-date highs, but today they are down an average of 3.5% MTD. Overall, developed markets have faired much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4.82% versus 1.24%, respectively. In fact, there are only two ETFs—Brazil (EWZ) and India (INDA)—that are currently positive for the month. Meanwhile, China (MCHI) is unchanged. On the other end of the spectrum, Sweden (EWD) has been the worst performer nearing an 11% decline with a number of other European nations following up with the next worst performance.

&gt; With stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in August, most have moved back below their 50-DMAs or even into oversold territory. There are no country ETFs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although EWZ and INDA have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/083122-GMD-1.png))**

&gt; As we show in the table above, this year's declines have resulted in the average country ETF falling 24% below its 52-week high. Those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below pre-COVID highs as well. At the moment, there are only four countries that remain above pre-COVID 52-week highs: Taiwan (EWT), India (INDA), the United States (SPY), and Canada (EWC). This exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert back to those prior highs, and as shown in the chart below, each one would also still have support at lows from earlier this year before pre-COVID highs become a technical level worth eying.

&gt; # High Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds

&gt; So far in 2022, stocks and bonds have both sold off, leading investors with a balanced portfolio to experience historically painful drawdowns. Rates have risen, and partially because of this fact, equities have had a tough year. The S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is down 16.0% on a YTD basis, while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) has shed 11.3% of its value. Typically, rates fall alongside equities, as investors shift their capital allocations to safer assets. 2022 has been different, though, and has seen selling in both bonds and equities. This has resulted in a historic level of positive correlation between the ETFs SPY and AGG going back to 2004 when AGG first started trading. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

&gt; Although the 200-day correlation between stocks (SPY) and bonds (AGG) has been higher once before (in late 2009), the current level remains particularly elevated. The current 200-day correlation sits at 0.87, which signifies a strong positive relationship. In the last 200 days, stocks have moved in the opposite direction of rates on most days, as the market is incredibly focused on the bond market as the Fed transitions from an accommodative to a restrictive stance in the face of higher inflation. Interestingly, the correlation coefficient does appear to be rolling over, moving lower in each of the last 15 trading sessions. Historically speaking, the correlation coefficient has tended to turn negative not long after rolling over, as illustrated by the chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-200-D-083022-2.png))**

&gt; The more we zoom in, the more the rollover becomes clear. The higher frequency measures, such as the 100 and 50-day correlation coefficients, have already moved substantially off of their recent highs, even though they are still elevated relative to history. The 100-day correlation coefficient is now at just 0.70, while the 50-day coefficient is even lower at 0.55, the lowest levels since mid-June and mid-May, respectively. This tells us that the 200-day correlation will likely pull back further, thus giving SPY a chance to gain even as rates rise, and visa-versa. As evidence of this, today SPY is down over 125 basis points even as AGG is up six bps, moving in opposite directions. To make a long story short, bonds and stocks may begin to diverge in terms of performance as the correlation between the two assets begins to roll over.

&gt; The rolling 100-day correlation between stocks and bonds has been over 0.5 (or 50%) for 129 trading days, which is the longest streak since the inception of AGG by a considerable margin. Although the coefficient is declining, the 100-day correlation would need to drop another 0.2 points for this streak to end.

&gt; # Continuing Claims Catching Up

&gt; Initial jobless claims had a strong showing this week as the previous reading was revised lower by 6K to 237K. From that revised level, claims fell another 5K down to 232K marking the lowest reading since the last week of June. That was also handily below expectations which were calling for an increase up to 248K. With another week over week decline, claims have now fallen for three weeks in a row; the longest streak of declines since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) basis, the current week of the year has historically marked the annual low. Assuming that is the case this year, 176.8K is in line with the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. Although further declines are not out of the realm of possibility, assuming normal seasonal patterns, NSA claims will likely rise from here through the end of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to initial claims.. While continuing claims remain low having avoided the same degree of upward drift that initial claims have experienced this year, this week's reading did move up to 1.438 million. That marks the most elevated level since the first week of April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; Recently we have been highlighting the ratio of initial claims to continuing claims as a way of showing the disconnect between the two seasonally adjusted readings. In other words, the lack of filter through of initial claims into continuing claims, which can be extrapolated as those filing for unemployment are quickly finding new roles. Although the ratio remains well above the historical norm and especially the range of readings observed since the early 1990s, it has begun to roll over in the past five weeks. As for just how big of a drop it has been, the decline ranks in the bottom 2% of all 5-week moves on record. While that is not to say the overall claims picture (initial claims not turning into continuing claims) has completely turned around, it is a sign that continuing claims have been playing a degree of catch-up.

personalfinance,Need advice on underpayment penalty to irs.,"So I can't go into exact specifics but I owe some people money at a really high interest rate 25% and it's quite a bit. 

I was planning on reducing my withholding through my w4 form to reduce the taxable liability each paycheck. I would do this by putting in a number well above what I itemize to decrease my taxes. 

It's showing the interest rate is 6% for unpaid taxes. When is the start date for that? Is that from the date they send me the letter or is that assessed over the previous year? Basically at what date does the interest start to compound. All the info on the irs website is vauge 

I plan on paying the taxes by April 15 it's just cheaper for me to divert cash flow to high interest debt and pay the small fine for underpayment. 

For reference my standard tax bill after I itemize is 40-55k a year.",finance,1662167524
stocks,Inflation is still as bad as it was in March.,"Source here: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/ 

Inflation was at 8.5% in March. It's almost half a year later and it's still at 8.5%. It's moving in the right direction but we have to remember: When we look at annual inflation, adding a month on one end and chopping a month from the beginning still leaves eleven months in the middle. If the Fed can lower inflation at the same pace at which it skyrocketed we're in for a full year of pain starting *today*.

This is what it means when you think about investing for the ""long term"". If you invested $1000 in the S&amp;P at its peak in 2001, it would take 13 years to break even. If you invested the money halfway down, it would take 10 years to break even. And right now, valuations remain sky high.

So I'm not an oracle, but IDK how the fuck people think they can fight the fed for the next year. You gotta really beat the market just to do better than holding cash. Equities are going to tank because the Fed is determined to destroy them, no?

Here's the thing: Even if the strongest growth companies priced at ridiculous valuations keep pace, that doesn't mean the market cap has to grow with them. These companies can keep growing while the share price shrinks to smaller multiples. This is what happened in the 70s: the airline industry took off, but investors lost heaps of cash trying to ride the wave.

What planet are the bulls living on right now? Cramer's basement?

economy,"Student loan forgiveness undermines one of our military’s greatest recruitment tools at a time of dangerously low enlistments,” Representative Jim Banks (R-IN) tweeted shortly after the announcement.","“ in the six years since Banks first ran for Congress, he has taken more than $400,000 from defense contractors,  weapons manufacturers, and other major players in the military-industrial complex. 
Corporate political action committees for Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, L3Harris Technologies, and Ultra Electronics have each donated tens of thousands of dollars to Banks, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data analyzed by OpenSecrets. He now sits on the House Armed Services Committee, which oversees the Department of Defense and United States military.

Members of the committee have already collectively received more than $3.4 million from defense contractors and weapons manufacturers this election cycle.

Banks’s admission highlights the way the student debt crisis has been exploited by the military-industrial complex. By saying the quiet part out loud, Banks is finally speaking the truth about how military recruiters use the GI Bill — the 1944 law that awards a robust benefits package to veterans — as a remedy for the cost of higher education to convince young people to enlist.

“To have members of Congress openly imply that the answer to this is to actually exacerbate hardship for poor and working-class youth is, actually, the best thing for young Americans to see,” Mike Prysner, an antiwar veteran and activist, told the Lever. “It proves their reasons for not joining are totally valid. Why allow yourself to be chewed up and spit out in service of a system that cares so little for you and your well being?”

CryptoCurrency,BTC weak at 20000$ - what are your thoughts ? Analysis for the sub [serious],"Yesterday after the stock markets were in solid green they all declined and dumped heavily most likely reacting to [G7 capping Russia oil and Russias reaction](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/09/02/business/russia-oil-price-cap-g7-intl-hnk/index.html) combined with weekend uncertainty that will be longer this time since Monday NA stock market are closed. ( Labor Day )

On the chart BTC keeps rejecting the [EMA 8](https://imgur.com/a/2pi4XsV)

This weakness combined with ongoing bad news about the EU gas problems and the US inflation rate still being high is not the greatest time for Crypto to have a recovery.

recently Chairmen Powell sounded more hawkish indicating a potential another interest rate hike trying to cool down inflation. 

Something I’ve mentioned before in this sub a couple weeks ago is also the more and more lowering Bitcoin [dominance](https://de.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-BTC.D/) which is in my opinion huge news. 


**the last time it was at such Level was 2018 and the huge 2021 sell-off**

Bitcoin also dropped below the [200 week moving average](https://imgur.com/a/3SfiwKs)

I personally see this as good and bad signal. Bad news it really looks like Bitcoin is on a cliff right now testing new lows and might fall under 19k trying to find support anytime soon.

On the bright side I think what we’ve witnessed the last months is really good for bitcoin. Crypto keeps surprising me how it’s doing during these bad global economic times. If you would’ve told me 1 year ago that we will have this situation I wouldn’t be sure if I could even expect Bitcoin to stay above 10k.

And I have about 60,000 saved. We found the perfect house in our desired neighborhood and they accepted our offer at 675,000. We have 20% cash to close on hand with a buffer of ~20k. We initially got quotes for 4.75 apr, not great but seems to be normal after the fed hike. The appraisal determined the in-law suite is actually metered separately and the two apartments in this suite make it a multi family home. This increases the risk portfolio for the lender and now they are quoting 6.75%.  A difference of ~$650 a month (mortgage now $4100 from $3600). We bring in around $12,000 net per month after paying 401k, life insurance, health insurance. I will sell our current house and hope for $250,000 in proceeds but I’ll plan for $200,000. So once I restructure the loan our mortgage will be $3,100 monthly. I can then use some of the freed up cash to pay to principal because this rate is HIGH! Does this make sense or should I walk away?

solar,Minimum distance between Enphase IQ Combiner Box and MSP?,"Hi all,

I'm in the design stage with a large solar installer in Los Angeles, CA, and we're currently in a standoff about placement of conduit and the IQ Combiner Box. For context, this is a 25 panel (Panasonic EVPV400H) installation with Enphase IQ8M microinverters, roof mounted, totaling 10 kW DC.

The installer wants to put the combiner box around the corner from the MSP and run conduit, stating that it must be at least 7 feet away from from the MSP. I can't find any reference to this requirement, do you know what they're talking about? They take a very black and white ""it has to go here or here"" approach, but I'm wondering if there are any creative solutions, and need to better understand the relevant requirements if I'm to do the outside the box thinking for them.

For aesthetic reasons, we are unwilling to install the device and conduit in their preferred location. Running it 7 feet in the opposite direction is possible but tricky (there's a water tank and large door in the way, so it's a tricky run requiring a bunch more conduit).

Also a somewhat related question: our MSP is top fed, does that mean that they must enter the MSP from the bottom? They seem to think so, but the solar breaker is usually at the top right, so how does that work? There is some existing unused conduit that goes to the top of the MSP that we are wondering if they could use (it's a 6 year old house so the conduit should be up to code, and is 1in).

investing,Is it a good idea to invest long term with loans?,"Say you have an income of 5000$ per month after taxes, and you wanted to save up enough money to retire as soon as possible.

You live in a low cost of living country, with an expected cost of about 1500$ per month to live large and 500$ per month to live a frivolous life, you decide to live large with 1500$ and place 500$ every month into an emergency fund.

You intend on staying invested until you reached your goal of $1.2M, after which you will apply FIRE with the vanguard withdrawal strategy (take 2.5% of you portfolio on bad years and 5% on good years), you estimate this will be more than enough to live a privileged life.

You decide to save up $3000 of your income per month to work towards that goal, which will be invested in a 100% stocks portfolio of MSCI world index and MSCI emerging markets, expecting a conservative 7% per year return.

With this plan, one could expect to reach their retirement goal in 17 years, not bad.

But here i want to introduce the loan aspect of the plan. In your residence county, you can take a financing loan with a 1.1% interest rate and you decide to get some leverage.

Instead of investing the $3000 per month, you decide to take a $450k dollars loan against them, to be paid back in 13 years.
During those years, you keep the $450k invested in the same investment, which will make you have your 1.2M, saving you 4 years of work, quite the save!

However you notice a problem, what would happen if you lost your job for multiple months? This is where the cost of living would kick in, the plan is to cut down on expenses, living on $500 per month, and using the emergency fund to survive while you look for a job. You are confident you can find a job that pays at least as much as your previous one, since you're a professional in a highly requested field. As an ultimate backup plan, you're willing to sell some of your shares to give yourself extra time to find a job in case of a critical failure. You would still have a better prospect than the 4 extra years of work.

What do you think about this plan? I've also heard about the possibility of an insurance plan in case of a job loss, which should add about 144$ to monthly expenses, i would take that out of the emergency fund.

Another thing to be considered is that rather than losing my job, I expect my income to severely increase over the following years, because of my obsession with finance, a strong trend of increased income over the past few years and some personal projects that I expect to double or triple my income in the next year.

I've also read that leveraging your investments early in life is a good idea as you have a larger margin of error thanks to time and expected increase in income, and given the fact that I'm 22, I should be in rage to receive those risk benefits

&gt; S&amp;P Global Inc. is an American publicly traded corporation headquartered in Manhattan, New York City. Its primary areas of business are financial information and analytics.

Can the market keep its current 20x valuation as earnings fall and bonds/treasuries become more attractive?

As earnings are released, you are looking at the market staying below 4000 until about Q1 2023 if current P/E ratio of 20x holds.

If investors flee equities because they want to lock in bonds/treasuries as they become more attractive (due to rising interest rates) or because they find equities with shrinking earnings less attractive, P/E ratios could fall below 20x (which is historically relatively high/inflated) causing for even more pain on the price side of the ratio.

With that said, if Q3 2022 EPS estimates are literally perfect and P/E ratio stays 20x, we'll end up at $3824.60

By Q3 2023, if EPS estimates are again perfect and P/E ratio stays unchanged, we'll end up at $4155.60

That'd be 8.65% return in 12 months, which is about inline with what equities do historically.

tl;dr 3763-3824 could be on the horizon, followed by the typical 8-10% return equities usually see as earnings grow and get returned to shareholders through price appreciation",finance,1662224588

While the overlay isn't a 1:1. I found it interesting that it does follow the pattern most of the time.

Assuming this holds true, what it shows is we could be looking at the price going to the low $17k range.

&amp;#x200B;

It should be noted this is only 1 bit of info. Things can change easily, and you should do more research into it before you use it to buy/sell anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Big thing to note that I found to be interesting is this last drop matches up around the time the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting is.

It most likely means nothing and just a coincidence. But I thought it should be noted.

* Stocks are down due to recession headlines and higher interest rates
* Eventually stocks should go back up when the economy gets better
* Since high-growth tech stocks are the ones that are getting hit the hardest in this bear market, that means they'll also gain the most when the market recovers.

-not enough cash. I’m not even sure what that means as the loan type doesn’t require any percentage down. Only employment income is verified. 

-too many accounts opened within past 12 months. I’ve opened maybe 5 credit accounts since summer last year. All in good standing or with 0 balance. Why would it matter that I’ve opened accounts as long as I’ve kept up with them?

-serious delinquency. I literally have no negative open accounts on my report. Would they look at closed accounts?

-credit score reported on the denial was 681, so not great but well above the requirements for FHA in California. This wasn’t an FHA loan, but no credit score was listed as a requirement.

investing,Is levered bond fund the best play right now?,"Background: 

Currently the market is pricing 3.4% rate fed funds rate by Jan 2023. Although it is likely that we will see more hikes because as many will rightly point out, if history were to be a guide, inflation persists until the fed funds rate matches the rate of inflation. The flip side of the argument is the previous instances of inflation were mostly demand pull inflation and not supply side inflation, therefore a less aggressive hike is needed.
In any case, 3.4% is not far off from the long term average rate of 4% rate that the Fed has used

How it applies investing:

My fav investment right now is NBB - Nuveen Taxable Municipal Income Fund. It’s a close end fund that uses leverage. Historically, default rate of muni bonds was 0.1% per year, and NBB is currently offering 7.4% yield. That’s a whole lot of return for very little risk.
Some pimco funds, like PDI and PDO have very diversified (but leveraged) bonds portfolio and with the current hammering of the bond market they offer as much as 12% yield and PDI has a good track record too. Checking on cefdata we can see they never paid out ROC (none of the funds I’ll mention do) and CEFconnect shows that there is no NAV erosion too. Of course NAV is bound to fluctuate with interest rates, but I see no evidence of long term erosion in NBB or PDI. My point is - I don’t see this is yield chasing, I see this as a very attractive deal

Conclusion:

Leveraged bond funds with solid track record offer great returns right now. The biggest risk is further NAV decline if fed funds rate exceeds current expectations but as well we can see, implied rate is not too far off the long term fed funds average therefore with some patience these investments are bound to be profitable. If we see a fed pivot, these investments will bring capital appreciation while also you will be able to lock in attractive YOC

personalfinance,Skyrocketing Insurance Costs and Increased Risk for Investment Condo,"Hello Reddit! I’d love to get ideas and opinions on our current situation. 

Background financial information: Bought a condo (instead of an expensive wedding) in San Diego in 2002 for 282k, spent very roughly 100k in upgrades and repairs over the years, mortgage balance is 180k @ 4.25%.

Moved to Seattle in 2008, rented out condo. Receive $2.5k / month, had planned to increase to $2800 a month. Current tenant’s lease renews in January, has resided there for at least 10 years. She’s a pretty good tenant so we keep rent a bit lower than market. Edit: Mortgage, taxes, and HOA fees are currently $1950/month, likely to be $2200 after HOA increase. This doesn’t include any additional insurance. 

Bought a home in Seattle in 2010 for 328k. Refianced last year to convert the detached garage into a rental home as well as lower interest rate. Total cost of project was initially estimated to be $100k but actually will be closer to $150k. Opened 3 cards with 0% APR for 14 months about 3 months ago to cover difference. Home should be complete and ready to rent in about 3 months. Anticipated rental income of $2.5k a month. Property is valued at around $900k but does not include the value that garage conversion will add. Mortgage balance about $400k.

We’ve had some personal setbacks over the years: in late 2010 I had to stop working (cancer researcher in university lab) due to disability. Husband works in IT but after some bad experiences as an IT manager decided to change careers. He was out of work for 3 years and we lived off of personal savings/retirement accounts. He’s now been working for 2 years as a control engineer (got the job through a friend I made playing an online game, lol). He’s quite happy with his new career. We’re mid 40s, no kids, happy to spend time and energy on nephews instead. We have about $50k in cash (and about $50k in 0% CC debt, all other CCs paid off monthly). When the 0% expires if we can’t pay off balances in full then we’ll open new 0% cards in husband’s name.

Our issue: We just got a letter from my condo HOA. The current insurer of the building won't renew the 50 million policy due to fire concerns. HOA couldn't find coverage on prime market and had to look for higher rate policies. They're doing a special assessment of about $3k to cover the added cost of a policy that only offers 5 million of coverage. We do have insurance as does tenant but it only covers inside walls.

I see two possible solutions: obtain umbrella insurance or do a 1031 exchange. In the letter we received it stated that losses beyond what’s covered by insurance will be billed as a special assessment to everyone. So it would seem that even if we covered our shortfall through umbrella insurance we’d still be on the hook for other’s losses? Our HOA payment will almost double to accommodate the insurance increase in addition to the special assessment. Also our current tenant is a single nurse, she really can’t afford much higher rent. If we did decide to sell it would seem like a bad idea to do so in January.

I don’t know much about 1031 exchanges but it’s my understanding that we’d have to buy and investment property. If we did buy something I’d prefer to buy a home for us to reside in and keep our current soon to be two residence property for the two monthly income streams. I’m not sure about where to get reliable advice regarding our situation (the last time I looked into financial advisors many were simply salespeople with just enough training to sell company mutual funds).

personalfinance,Should I sell my house I just bought this year,"Hi everyone. I recently bought my first house in March of this year. The house was listed for 460k and I got it for 450k with the sellers paying $10k of the closing costs. I also put about $20k down on the house. The interest rate is 3.25%. 

I rushed into the home buying process because I was excited to find out I can finally buy a house after rebuilding my credit and finally making enough money to do so. I’m self employed and make over 6 figures a year so paying my mortgage isn’t that big of a problem. The problem is I’m not happy with the house I purchased. 

I honestly think I would rather just rent and not worry about all the extra costs of fixing things and being in debt. Renting feels like it has more freedom since you’re technically debt free. I do not have any debt besides the mortgage. 

Would it make sense to sell this house so soon and just go back to renting? Or should I stay in this house for a little while? I’m trying to find out what financially makes sense. Thank you.",finance,1662292411

Thanks for stopping by. I'm a 26m living in Boston MA working in Tech; current income is $150,000 base salary, $30,000 bonus + $9,000 401k match dollars per year from my company. I bought a Condo in Boston in September 2021 w/ a 2.9% interest rate w/ 10% down conventional loan. Basically I'm looking for advice on how to build a lot of wealth; I have big goals &amp; dreams, like waterfront home for a family one day &amp; owning businesses that bring me passive income.

Numbers are as follows:

$10,000 in Emergency Fund

$29,000 in 401k

$23,500 in taxable brokerage

$6,000 in Health Savings Account

$2,000 in Roth IRA (above income limit for now, should I open a Traditional IRA? Currently also contributing 5% of income to Roth401k or megabackdoor roth because of this.)

Condo: 200,000 equity (357,000 remaining, valued/could sell for close to $600,000) 1 bed 1 bath 800 sq ft right in downtown Boston, MA)

This puts my current N/W at right around $270,000. I currently max out both 401k &amp; HSA for the year, as well as contribute an additional 5% of my income to the megabackdoor roth since my income is above the limit to contribute to a Roth IRA. After that, I put whatever is left over into my emergency fund savings account as well as buy VTI in my taxable brokerage. I spend 20% of my income because I have a girlfriend, we like to travel &amp; try new foods + living in Boston MA is not cheap. Basically I want to become wealthy but don't want to live like a hermit in getting there so I force myself to spend some money to maintain a good relationship &amp; social connections and cool experiences as I see these all as important life long learning opportunities.

What can I do to substantially build wealth? Buy more property...use my current condo as a rental &amp; buy and move into another primary leveraging home equity as a net worth builder? Increase income.. in some way? Business idea's for someone in my position?

My goals are to build substantial wealth, own a waterfront home somewhere in Massachusetts &amp; lot's of land and rental property and businesses. What do I need to do?

He says we can easily beat the 5% with proper investing and it'd be wasted money to pay down loans any faster.

Yesterday I spoke to one of my brothers financial advisors who is in an independent firm and he told me I'd be a fool to not aggressively pay off the debt. He's claiming you'd be very hard pressed to beat that interest rate long term and it's best to direct all available cash flow into paying off debt until they are gone. But he did say just straight up investing in the S&amp;P 500 will yield just a hair under 10%, so that makes me learn towards the northwestern approach. He made a good point in telling me the northwestern guy won't make any money if I pay it all off but he will make money if I invest through their firm, so I'm a little torn here.

Does anyone have a similar/recent experience with paying off a large amount of debt with decent cash flow? I'm obviously very new to investing and having any cash flow whatsoever so any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1662305669
personalfinance,Solo 401K thoughts and questions,"Hi there everyone,

I opened a solo 401k account with etrade a few years ago when i started my freelancing business. 
1) I rolled over my previous employers 401k into this account
2) I continue to add to the account anytime I pick up some freelancing work
3) Now I have the flexibility to direct these funds as I see fit. Partial growth stocks, some penny stock (gambling) and the rest dividend investing.

I have a decent balance now and came across a post talking about the ability to take a loan out against your 401k, max of $50K or 50% of your balance whichever is less.

From my understanding, I set the interest rate (must be reasonable) and any interest I pay back against the loan just gets added to my 401k account.

If I am understanding correctly, I could take out a loan and use the money as a down payment or even to purchase other assets then anything I pay back just goes back to myself. 

The only downside I am seeing is that now I have a monthly payment (that comes with any loan) but the upside is I'm paying myself not a back.

Is there anything I am missing?
Has anyone done this before?
If so, what are some of the assets you've bought with this?

I feel like I just found the best cheat code in final fantasy and now im gonna own any boss haha.",finance,1662307799
stocks,The Problem With The “PermaBear” Accusation,"I see a lot of people online talk refer to people who have been predicting this collapse as “permabears” and I understand why - but I think there is a serious problem with that accusation. 

If someone understands interest rates as more than arbitrary numbers - and - instead as an actual market prices that coordinates the decisions of saving and investing - as the economist Hayek did - well then as long as The Fed is still manipulating interest rates to be artificially low - then said permabear’s investing thesis would still hold true. This is before getting into the inflation problem and QE. 

So, if the FED has been massively inflating the money supply for years and a permabear is constantly saying “this is creating a bubble , this will end badly” - is he truly a permabear?

If someone is shooting heroin and I say “you need to stop. You are going to OD and die.” And after 3 years of shooting up - they die - was I being overly pessimistic? I view -some- so-called permabears in the same way. 

Now - there are actual permabears who are loons - and think the US economy is going to zero - that’s obviously not true. 

But look at the correlation between money supply and stocks prices the past few years - it’s like .9 

There is a lot of fake money propping things up that is going to get removed from the system and all adjacent businesses will begin a deleveraging process.

Just to end this tangent, I have no doubt that dollar cost averaging and buy and hold works. The data is pretty clear on that. However, if you are able to massively increase returns by shifting strategies during times like these by understanding a little Econ - why would you not? 

As a final point, I’m young (24) and haven’t sold any of my investments. I have, however, been taking advantage of this downturn by using puts and inverse ETFs (non leveraged) to build wealth so I can buy as we get closer to the bottom. 

Anyways, just thought I’d give my 2 cents.",finance,1662308069

personalfinance,When do you suggest refinancing for a lower interest rate?,"We recently bought a house under the PFHA (PA’s new version of a FHA program) where they give you up to $15,000 in tax credit. The interest rate was raised to 7% right when we locked in. 

We’ve only just made our first mortgage payment, but I’m wondering how do we know when to refinance? 

I understand that most people do it on a percentage (like .5 - 1% decrease) or a rough estimate on how much you would save ($500~) but I have no idea how to check where my specific loan’s rates are or how much money we’ll need to even do that. Or if you’re refinancing would I go with a conventional loan instead? When I asked the loan officer I worked with, they said it was too early to ask.

economy,Signs of a coming recession are growing,"As a result of August, the expectations of the industrial sector in the developed Asian economies also deteriorated significantly. The fall in economic activity in South Korea and Taiwan has reached its highest pace since the start of the pandemic: the decline in new orders is in the nature of a landslide, not a controlled slowdown. The rapid decline in orders led to the fact that in South Korea the volume of accumulated but unfulfilled orders decreased for the first time since October 2020, and in Taiwan, the volume of accumulated orders decreased at the highest rate since the beginning of 2009 (the peak of the global recession!). At the same time, the rate of decline in output in August became the highest since the start of the pandemic.

[PMI Manufacturing](https://preview.redd.it/o3imbgd42wl91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=251c7207542916d1a1f0e8fb045043918f848128)

The dynamics of the leading indicators of South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore indicate a rapid weakening of global demand for electronics and semiconductor products, which was the result of both a gradual decline in real incomes of the population in the world due to high inflation rates and the tightening of monetary policy by central banks in most countries of the world.

[Industrial production, YoY, &amp;#37;, 3m avg.](https://preview.redd.it/6fcjtl492wl91.jpg?width=756&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b0c2f1f466d5a21c9d6de74833448a181db1ba8)

As a result of this drop in demand, South Korea and Taiwan have experienced the weakest increase in selling prices since 2020, as well as an improvement in the situation in the supply chains of goods, the disruption of which has been one of the reasons for the world's record inflation rates in decades. Thus, the inflationary pressure in this sector is beginning to weaken due to the actions of the monetary authorities.

However, let me remind you that central banks are now only in the middle of a cycle of tightening monetary policy, and we are already seeing a collapse in demand for electronic components. An analysis of historical statistics indicates that the decline in demand for electronics in these regions begins on average for 3-6 months before a steady decline begins to be recorded in other industrial sectors and regions, primarily in developed countries, which then drags other developing economies.

Thus, my assumption is confirmed that even the measures already taken by central banks are enough to cool the global economy; however, central banks will once again exceed the amplitude of changes in interest rates necessary to stabilize the economic situation, which will contribute to an increase in the depth of the upcoming recession in 2023.

stocks,"It’s not different this time, The Great Crash","Everyday I hear some reason to go all in and throw my life savings into the stock market 

These quotes are used very redundantly and wont seem to go away

“Buy the dip” or “the bottom is in” and my favorite “inflation is slowing” 

The wall-street media machine is suffering from a complete and compulsive denial of reality. 

A crash is coming like it or not, and it will be painful. 

For the crash deniers. A market crash isn’t abnormal at all. It is part of the boom/bust cycle. Yes markets move in cycles.

Also the fed can’t u-turn it’s caught in a debt trap. Meaning the fed can no longer buy treasury’s because debt to GPD levels have become unsustainable. Also inflation is spiraling outta control. So the fed cant cause more inflation. It’s hands are tied.
 
Tech is still highly overvalued. P/E ratios are still out of sync with rational logic and reasoning. What makes these companies worth so much? Besides the hype. 

From a historical perspective. Most major booms come with a major bust. The dot com boom, seems very similar to this 2020 boom with enormous amount of retail interest in the stock market. 

Let’s not forget that there is a global slowdown in growth. China is going through their own economic woes. Europe is struggling with recession. Sri Lanka is collapsing as well as Pakistan. 

The law of thermodynamics states that loss in a system is inevitable. And we can’t expect a system to sustain itself forever without adding more energy. This notion lines up with Karl marks socio economic theory of capitalism. (Crisis theory) which states that the amount of initial capital you use to run a business is lost and to sustain the business more capital is needed to an unlimited amount. ( is it possible to grow forever?)

Academic theory aside,  the constant bad news from policymakers at the fed is enough to know trouble is brewing. 

And no, don’t go buy gold and doomsday bunkers. We will have to ride this one out like adults. It’s not always sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes we have to deal with things and it’s just a little bump in the road

vet,"Small dog vomiting for five days, otherwise normal","Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is so long, just wanted to be thorough. 

My 4.5 year old male Havanese dog has been vomiting the last five days. He is neutered and weighs 15 pounds. He's a short boy, so he's a little chunky but not fat. We live in Oklahoma. He has eaten Eukanuba small breed dog food his entire life. Started with puppy formula, and transitioned to adult. We have also treated him with the occasional chicken and rice for dinner, and scrambled eggs for breakfast(with cheese). No new food or treats have been added recently. He is an inside dog unless he is with my wife or I.

In my yard I've seen frogs, spiders, ticks, tiny garden snakes, and we have three outside cats that are all young and healthy. The only concerning insect I've ever seen are black widows, and I assume it would be much worse if that was the problem. The day before this began he was in the yard with me as I was pulling some weeds, and sprayed some Ortho Home Defense bug killer, but I'm almost certain he didn't have any access to that as he stays on the porch and I was working 20-30 yards from him. We've had heavy rain recently so there were some mushrooms that have sprouted up recently, which I believe I removed before he would have access to, but I can't be 100% certain I didn't miss  
one. 

He began throwing up early Wednesday morning(five days ago), which he has done in the past like all dogs do, and we thought nothing of it. It was yellow-ish(bile we assume) with some undigested food in it. He has strange eating habits and doesn't really eat much unless my wife and I are home and in the same location. We sat down Wednesday evening and he ate some food, but vomited it up within an hour or two. This process has gone on since Wednesday, but the time between eating and vomiting is getting shorter. It was the yellow-ish bile up until 36 hours ago. The vomit has changed to white foamy, still with undigested food in it. All throughout this process he has been full of energy and eager to eat, but just can't keep it down. He drinks water as he usually would, and has solid bowel movements throughout this process as well. Urination seems to be normal as well. Gums aren't pale, gets excited to go outside, barks at anything that comes in the yard, all the usual happy dog things.

So we took him to the emergency vet last night, and they did blood work. They stated ""he is still very bright/alert, well hydrated and all other findings unremarkable"". He was given fluids via an IV(has a hump where the fluids were injected, but it is shrinking) and an anti-nausea shot. When I got him home I gave him an 1/8cup of chicken and white rice and fed it slowly to him(he always eats very fast). Even though it was a small amount, I gave it to him in bits to make him eat slower. He threw up within 15 minutes in two separate piles with the majority of it in the first pile. Again white foamy with the undigested chicken/rice. They suggested I get some over the counter famotidine(pepcid), and feed him 30 minutes after taking it. I have not given him the pepcid yet, as I figured the anti-nausea shot would be sufficient for the 24 hours that the paperwork stated.

He's been very healthy up to this point, and we're not sure if this something that just needs time to pass or if we should be taking further steps medically. If I left out any important information please let me know, and thank you so much in advance for any advice.

A month of inflation not rising does not mean it's peaked. Layoffs are increasing, interest rates rising, QT happening. Have you seen the situation in Europe and China?

China is shutting down factories, their economy is imploding, bank runs are on the verge of happening and their real estate market is collapsing.

Europe is just screwed. England is talking about rationing power like a third world country, in some European countries inflation is over 20%, war in ukraine, failed Russia sanctions.

I am currently a 21 y/o student who wants to know if I am on the right track when it comes to maximizing my personal finance goals. Currently, I have been following the FI/RE movement and want to retire as early as possible through investments. This is my current financial situation and information, please let me know if there is anything I can do to accelerate my plan!

I am in my last year of Physician Assistant school on a federal scholarship so tuition is free and I receive a stipend of approximately $1300/mo. I am currently set to pay $1200 in rent + utilities for my new apartment lease rate. I receive free food through Food Stamps (EBT) at grocery stores. I spend approximately $200/mo going out for food/drinks/misc activities. My parents have been generous enough to pay whatever balance I have left over from my credit card that I have gone over the stipend - however, do not want to continuously rely on them for money and want to independently start creating my own wealth.

Each year my dad maxes out my ROTH IRA (approx 6K/year) since I was 18. Starting next year, I am planning to do the same with my salary. 

Starting next year, I am set to make about $130,000 gross income with some type of 401k benefits and health insurance. I am planning to max out my 401k match contributions, but after that, the plan is to invest as much as possible in index funds like VTI every paycheck. My family tells me to invest in real estate during a downturn as this is how they made their wealth, would that be a better plan?

I live fairly modestly and plan to drive the same car and rent in an apartment around the $1000 range after graduation. I am hoping to retire before 30 years old if this is at all possible and just have my money snowball in investments. I am prepared to invest $70,000 per year if this is possible and plugged it into a FI/RE calculator with a 8% return rate. Am I missing something in this picture? Is it worth considering moving to a income-tax-free state to make this process even faster?

My dream life would be being able to travel and enjoy time with family without worrying about money or financial security through work. I would obviously still work afterward, but doing something I enjoy and working the hours that I want to rather than have to.

economy,What is happening on Market now?,"Equities had another bruising week, with NASDAQ and RUSSELL falling by almost 5% compared to a week ago. **Crypto markets, on contrary, diverged and ended up bit higher, with Bitcoin up by 1.9% compared to the previous week, closing slightly below the psychological 20k level. ETH experienced the highest jump by more than 10% closing at 1.577 from its recent lows of 1.430.**

This was mainly fuelled by the upcoming Merge and weak US jobs report on Friday. The selling pressure on equities came after the US labor department data showed uptick in unemployment rate and a slower pace of job growth, adding 315,000 jobs in August compared to 526,000 added in July. After the report release, the equity market went up along with the crypto market, but fell right after Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned energy group, said it would close the Nord Stream gas pipeline indefinitely, which eventually happened on Friday as EU leaders agreed on gas price caps. This put further squeeze on Europe’s energy supplies which means higher energy prices.

The FED is still expected to raise interest rates in September, with overall expectations still closer to 0.75% than 0.50%. The expectations cooled slightly after Friday’s job report, suggesting the central bank will raise its main rate to around 3.83% by March 2023 from a projection of 3.95% at the close on Thursday. We expect they will raise again in September by 0.75%. The US is in technical recession, as its last quarterly GDP contracted for the second straight quarter, declining by 0,90%.

Eyes are on the ECB this week, which is expected to hike interest rates this week by up to 0.75%. It raised rates from -0.50% to zero in July 2022. However, if the ECB decided to raise by 0.75%, it will be the second time in its history. The first time they raised rates by that much was in 1999 because of the technical adjustment after the Euro’s launch.

With energy crisis engulfing the EU continent, ECB governing council members have called to act by front-loading the path of future rate rises to prevent surging inflation from becoming a 1970s style spiral of persistently higher wages and prices.

algorand,Period 4 vote,"While lack of Algo anywhere including defi and trading liquidity is a narrative anyone can sympathize witch, heck don't we all feel we could need some more Algo,  there is no proof of such initiatives in those areas at the cost of other Algo holders would be aligned with the interest of those other Algo holders who are paying for it. 

There is already non prohibitive liquidity for Algo

 Given that governance Algo are soft locked the resulting reduced sell pressure will drive price upwards which is typically more valuable than selling it down through liquidity or DeFi loans without further qualification. 

These measures of period 4 are much more conceivably beneficial for others than previous round of attempted power grab by DeFi but still I'm leaning towards 1B and 2B. There are enough Algo out there and the more that gets  locked in governance without centralization of voting power to Defi the easier it will be for DeFi to have a competitive ROI. 

The foundation could focus measures on many things, why not on getting more Algos into governance, the ROI would be 2%, the lock up's upward push on price would be substantial, and DeFi could easily compete on interest rate with the billions of Algo still unlocked. 

If DeFi could describe how their increased financing activities from governance subsidies would ultimately drive buy pressure on Algo while doing generally good in the world then that would make a vote in their favour more supported. 

Proven successes with financing of others so that they in turn create buy pressure on Algo would be appreciated.",cryptocurrency,1662386325

personalfinance,"FERS, Social Security and spousal survivor benefits","Kind of a specific question here…

Both my mother and father were federal employees and were in the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). They retired a number of years ago (after age 65), and then my dad passed away in his mid 70’s. 

My mom got remarried in her 80’s to a gentle about 5 years her senior. They were married 12 years and he just passed away.

He received Social Security benefits. In my reading of the SSA website it seems to me that she should be eligible for spousal survivor benefits. However, she is concerned that because she is a part of the FERS system and thinks she is ineligible for Social Security benefits (which she is for any SS benefits she has earned, since that would be double dipping which is disallowed).

Is she eligible, however, for survivor benefits from his SS?

personalfinance,How To Request: Managing the Behavioral Component of Personal Finance,"**TLDR:** My most important personal finance goals just aren't sexy. What do people do to stay motivated, consistent and successful towards their identified goals?

&amp;#x200B;

Recent (and expected) significant salary increase has allowed me to move out of the survival mode of my lifetime personal finance journey and jump start the building wealth phase (more accurately climb to net worth $0 ha).

What I have noticed is that its much less satisfying than expected. For example:

 I paid a lump sum payment on my private student loans and finished them off (still have some federal loans that I have left alone given the COVID interest/payment freeze). I had been paying them every month for 6 years and I finished it out 4 years early. Hurray Me! **BUT** easily some of the least fun money I've ever spent. I understand the argument that its money I already spent so the fun has already been had. But it still doesn't feel as good as I thought it would. I feel like that money would feel better sitting in an investment account with a big satisfying balance number on it. I tried to make if fun and calculate all the interest I had paid so far, all the interest I saved by paying it off early, etc. And I don't think that helped either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's not even talk about how unexciting it is to get payroll deductions funding a 401k of broad index funds that slowly lose money every time they are checked on. 

&amp;#x200B;

My goals are unexciting. I want to build, invest, grow and dig myself out of the student loan debt hole in which I find myself; but afraid that if i don't make it fun/exciting/interesting, I will stray and fail to be as aggressive as I could be (need to be?). 

  
I had always scoffed at the snowball method of loan repayment, imagining all the extra money paid by paying in the wrong interest rate order. But now I see anything to hack your own finance psychology might be well worth it. 

I have written goals for savings, student loan pay offs:  save this much by this date, pay off this much student loans by this date. As well as rules like rent for 2 more years, no car upgrade while student loans exist.

Sorry for the long post. Thanks for your wisdom and time.",finance,1662395588

I have $32k in 401k matched 5% by the company at the end of the year. I was really hoping to convert some of that bond money into NASDAQ or S&amp;P index funds, but the provider doesn't have those, and most of the indexes track different Russel Indicies.

CryptoCurrency,The Anti Crypto conference (Crypto Symposium) just took place a few hours ago; here are the cliff notes:,"* Both Stephen Diehl and Darren Tseng introduced the need for such conferences to bring millions of crypto skeptics to educate and provide resources to lawmakers to make better public policy to stop crypto.   ""Cryptos is nothing more than gambling"".   Then the first speaker joins
* Member of Congress Brad Sherman joins first. He says he has been a skeptic from before the current market crash.   They say a few 100 crypto oligarchs are ""making money by making money"".   He goes on to call out crypto as taking money from less privileged to these ""crypto bros"".Sherman says now Wall Street, Zuckerberg, Goldman Sachs, and more are now minting billions.   Crypto is not a currency, your short term bet is to sell it someone else. Long term bet is hoping it becomes a world currency then explains how impractical crypto as a currency is. Regulations require regulated entities are required to ensure KYC, legitimacy of customers and the money itself.   Brad Sherman says once you move funds to your own wallet it becomes anonymous.   For crypto to become currencies need advantage over current currencies.Selling point is the name that translates to ""hidden money"". He says there are trillions of dollars' economy that crypto caters and lists those as drug smugglers, money launderers, etc.   Asks, if we make drug dealers a little more efficient how many deaths will we see? Cites Virgil Griffith case who confessed to teaching NOrth Korea how to move money with crypto.  Gives a few more examples like Lazarus groups, and others.
* Professor Steven Diamond joins the conference.   He is a lawyer and consultant for corporate law and many more things.   Says the problem is majorly for the USA.   Concern for regulator is If you begin to steer people's savings to unregulated markets you lose accountability. Just in last year, a massive sell off, a crash has triggered enormous concern across political spectrum.   Gives a lesson on Federal Securities Regulation. Core principle being when playing with other people's money, you have a social responsibility.
* John Stark joins the discussion. Says this is a symposium of crypto knights.   He says when you give your money to someone, and if they have to make you more money, it's a security. so it has to be regulated and must have protection. Crypto doesn't have that is the implication. Says the laws like Howie Test, they are supposed to be broad. Explains examples of how they have fought against many scams who then these very laws reprimanded.   Says Securities regulations are not complex and they should apply on Crypto.
* Ruth Wandhofer says these laws are based on principles and hence the technology advancement is still covered under them.   John Stark says with lack of regulations, license, insurance and transparency, does not protect people.
* John Stark says the regulators help protect people. Says you don't fight with the regulator as you can be put out of business overnight. John Stark says there have been horrendous failure like Sub prime Crisis, but overall it is very helpful to have SEC and other agencies regulate public markets.
* Stephen Diamond says if we do not have system to regulate how other people's money is being used then the system collapses

CryptoCurrency,How Bad Will The War Get Between Banks and Crypto?,"I've seen alot of people say that their banks want nothing to do with crypto. I can also say that in my country that no bank will accept crypto. At least part of it however has to do with the uncertainty of the US CFTC and SEC on coins status, I believe.

We now see the Fed seemingly going forward with their own coin. Now if the Fed has their own coin, what need do they have for banks as every citizen can just have an account directly with the Fed, and this gives government more control. Anyone disagreeable to thr government can directly have their accounts frozen or at least people agreeable to the government can have better terms and rates for things like loans.

On the other side actual decentralised crypto is meant to directly sidestep banks.

Basically, banks look like they'll be squeezed both from decentralised crypto and from the Fed's token. The best case for the banks is the Fed picking just a few of the big ones like JP and BoA and having them continue operations but instead use the Fed token. Still, the majority of the banks would probably die.

I can't imagine banks taking this lying down. I think things are going to get nasty, with the little guy being caught in the middle, as usual. We probably already seeing signs.",cryptocurrency,1662402300
personalfinance,Is inflation higher than interest rate for always real estate a good thing?,"TITLE EDIT:  **Is inflation higher than interest rate for real estate always a good thing?** 

I see comments on the internet where people are saying it is a good thing. But I am a bit skeptical.

For example:

Say interest rates are 5%, inflation is 10%. You buy a 100k house with 5k per year interest. Your 100k yearly salary now loses 10% of it's value, so you are now essentially making 90k. After paying paying your interest rate 90k - 5k, your takehome is 85k.

If inflation is 5%, your 100k salary now loses 5% of it's value and you are essentially making 95k and if interest rates are the same, you come back with more becasue after paying paying your interest rate 95k - 5k, your takehome is 90k.",finance,1662403035

CryptoCurrency,Could BTC switch to Proof of Stake?,"Bitcoin is a protocol that uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) as it's consensus mechanism. This is a mechanism that involves significant energy consumption, which increases as the value of BTC increases, but at the same time guarantees high immutability of it's blockchain.  


Other cryptocurrency protocols, on the other hand, use Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because it is a less energy-intensive mechanism and allows for faster block generation. However, it is somewhat less secure than PoW.  


I should also add that I'm not against  
 Proof-of-Stake because I do not mine and I am more focused on other aspects of crypto like Blockchain finance, security tokens like Aave, Ovenue, DigiFt and basically whether BTC goes to PoS makes very little difference to me but still the concept is very interesting to discuss.  


For example, Ethereum was made with PoW, but then decided to switch to PoS over the years. Could something similar happen to Bitcoin?  


As of today, the answer is definitely no.  


In reality, no one has the power to change the Bitcoin protocol at will, and there is currently no large majority of Bitcoin users who would accept such a radical change.  


The transition from PoW to PoS requires a complete change of the system by which blocks are created, so much so that Ethereum, for example, even had to create a new blockchain based on PoS and decided to abandon the old PoW once the final switch was made.  


Perhaps in the relatively distant future there could be a strong majority of users of Bitcoin who would approve such a radical change, but today we cannot even glimpse this scenario.  


Additionally, while some argue that Bitcoin's energy consumption will continue to increase at a high rate until the transition to PoS is necessary, in reality, in the long run, Bitcoin mining's energy consumption is likely to decline due to continued halving of the mining rewards once every 4 years.  


This means that no one forbids imagining in pure theory what the transition of Bitcoin to PoS could entail.  


It's actually not that hard. In fact, if it was decided to replace PoW with PoS on Bitcoin as well, the process could even be very similar to the one carried out by Ethereum.  


However, PoW allows the block time on which Bitcoin's monetary policy depends to be kept very constant over the years: a block is created every 10 minutes or so, and BTC halves the premium every 210,000 blocks which is just under 4 years. With PoS, it may be more difficult to keep this monetary policy firm and rigid.  
Which is probably one of the main reasons it may not switch at least not in the foreseeable future.",cryptocurrency,1662410312

personalfinance,Good time to sell house,"Hello,

I recently separated with my wife. We've been married for a couple years and we have an infant child. We only talk through our attorneys and it looks to become a pretty contested divorce, mainly regarding custody.

We bought a house together some years ago. It has since gone up quite a bit, worth about $600K and we owe $315K.

She moved back in with her mother and stopped paying the mortgage and all house expenses.

The mortgage with escrow is $1750 a month. Utilities including water, sewer, trash, gas, electric, internet, security, etc average $400.

My credit is good, 805.

I don't have any CC debt, car payment or student loans.

I make $70K at my job and take home around 3.5K/month after paying for the medical insurance family plan.

I have $30K in my 401K and some savings.

After paying the mortgage, living expenses, child support and my attorney fees I'm slowly eating away my savings.

I'm thinking about asking her to sell the house and split the money 50/50 (even if I paid a big chunk of the down payment). The only way to get her off the mortgage is to refinance, right now that is not a viable option with those high interest rates. 

I would be in a better spot financially if I come away with $120K profit.

The value of the property came down 4% the last 2 months (according to Zillow). I'm afraid if I wait longer I would be missing out on quite some money if there is a big correction coming up.

I have family in the area I can live with for a while and biding my time to see what the market does.

Is it a bad idea to try to sell right now? I’ve been mulling over this decision for a long time now and want to make the best one.

Would love any advice and if I’m overlooking any important factors.

Probably the worst place to ask this but just wanting to get a gauge of opinion from (I hope) sound minded individuals. 

I recently got a low-ish interest, 0% for 12 month, credit card with ability to do a money transfer with a 4% fee that falls into the 0% interest for 12 months. I was debating doing this in order to clear an overdraft and simply pay it off the credit card rather than directly via my bank. The 4% transfer fee is approx 1.1% more than my normal money overdraft interest rate. 

My thoughts are that, given my overdraft interest rate is higher than even the credit alone, I would always benefit from using the money transfer option, incurring the 4% and clear it over the 12 months rather than incurring the 36% annual interest fee for the overdraft. Also the fact I will only pay 4% in total over 12 months using the money transfer and 0% interest, this would be the better option?

personalfinance,Car loan calculations incorrect,"Hey everyone. Bare with me here but I'm trying to buy a car and my calculations of monthly payments are coming out vastly different than what I'm being quoted by the dealerships and I'm wondering what I'm missing. 

Let's take a $25,000 car for example. I live in a HCOL area and tax is 10% (and add in $400 for title/license fees) so we're at $27,400.

I subtract out a $12,000 cash down payment on the car.

We're at $15,400 for the finance portion. I was quoted an interest rate of 3.99% (I've seen everything from this up to 6.5% for my 800+ credit score).  

I'm being told that this amounts to a $289 car payment for 72 months.

My hand math (15,400 x .039 = $600) so ($16,000 loan / 72 months) = $222/month.

The dealership quoted me $289/month. 

How am I almost $70/month off?

So then I use: https://www.calculator.net/auto-loan-calculator.html

Type in all of the above information. ($25k price, 72 months, 3.9% interest, $12k down, Illinois, 10% tax, $400 for title/license fees). 

This shows a monthly payment of $202. Still nowhere near what the dealerships are quoting me.  Even if I click the ""include all fees in loan"" button, it's still $248 and not near the $289 they are quoting.

\- 6.26% interest rate, obviously increasing further.  
\- Min repayment approx $2000 a month.

\- Min repayment approx $690 a month.

No other debt, credit cards, or finance. I am expecting the area I live in to have a moderate increase in house prices next year (not looking to argue this point).

Do I:  
\- Aggressively pay down the car for next 6-12 months with the aim to remove that debt completely.

personalfinance,I could put over half down on a house. But should I?,"***TLDR
I have 400k cash and want to put it all down on a house in San Diego for $650k and get a 250k mortgage. We earn $160k combined but have unavoidable costs of 2k a month. A lower mortgage feels more manageable and like we can still have a life. But people tell me to put the money to work for me instead of giving it all to the bank. But if I put less down and invest then the mortgage will be big and hard to manage and I'm scared to lose the rest.***

I sold my house and have 400k, a job that earns 60k, my spouse earns 100k working for the government and has 20 years federal/military service.  We have a side hustle based on the car which pays for about half the car payment and we are working hard to make it bigger. Their car payment is $870 and alimony + care for their adult disabled child is about $1500. I consider that cost permanent since the adult child will never be self sufficient. So consider those costs on top of normal expenses.

Here’s the pickle. I want to move to San Diego. We clearly don’t earn enough for San Diego but my hope is that our house proceeds can help us get there. I’m quite careful with money and don’t use credit well. Like I used to pay cash for things.  This is more to say that I feel like a bit of a financial idiot than anything.  But both our credit scores are over 800. So my thought was to put 400k down on a 650k house and get us a 250k mortgage. So maybe $1500 a month.

This idea feels good to me because then if I lose my job, he could probably manage it alone. If his child requires help, if we want to travel, if we want to buy me a cheap car, whatever it is, we could maybe do it because our incomes can afford a $1500 mortgage. Although I do understand that San Diego will be more expensive in taxes and utilities, so perhaps I have to make that sum larger in my mind. But isn’t that more reason to get a smaller mortgage?

But, some wealthier people I know have balked at the idea of me putting all this money down. They say to put down the minimum and invest the rest safely. They say it’s a huge mistake to tie all the money up in real estate when it could be earning me. 

I’m not sure what to do and how to play this. I’m very tentative and scared of losing it all. I don’t come from a wealthy family so I don’t have much buffer or backup. The rich people scare me because they sound so flippant with money but I feel like they know how to use it and I dont.

I have two accounts in collections, one that I currently am paying (due to them wanting to sue) that is costing me 217$ a month and has 1500$ remaining.

I was looking into debt consolidation recently and I have found that only upstart was willing to give a weary soul like me a chance. I went in applying for a 2500$ loan to be able to pay off my other account in collections, my Wells Fargo charge off, and the remainder of the 1500$ debt they wanted to sue me for. They approved me for the amount I applied for at 35% APR. Then I saw that they approved me up to 4500$ and I was really shocked as no other lender wanted anything to do with me. What I was thinking of doing was essentially consolidating all of my debts (credit card debt, collections, charge off) onto the full amount of 4500$ cause conveniently that’s everything I owe in total. Now before y’all crucify me regarding the astronomically high interest rate, please hear out my reasoning:

I have only been able to afford minimum payments on my cards for the last few years due to being so financially strapped. My balances seem to never drop because the interest puts it right back to where it was before I paid essentially. This new payment of 217$ that I had to start paying recently has pushed me to financial ruin and I have been so depressed and anxious as of late that I want to cry each day. 
My payment that I would have to make for that 4500$ loan would be 160$ each month while I am currently paying around 400$ for all my debts across the board. This would mean my expense would drop around 240$ monthly which might not seem like a lot but that extra money seems like such a godsend right now. Coupled that with the fact that it would also FIX my credit since I would no longer have any delinquent accounts and my credit card usage would be at 0% since I consolidated them. Now moving back to that high interest, I have done the math and have calculated that I would pay a whopping 4000$ ish in interest over the 5 year term and that made me want to poop my pants. My idea was to essentially take this loan for the mean time and essentially fix my credit (probably gonna cut my cards up not gonna lie), lower my monthly payments so I can finally have some breathing room for the first time in years, and then eventually apply for another loan in the future once my credit fixes with a much lower APR and pay off the balance with that. I know I would basically be “throwing away money” with that interest rate, but to me it seems like for the first time in years I finally have a way to get my financial situation in order. I know by no means is this an ideal situation or solution but I guess all I’m asking is, is this a huge financial mistake or have I really found my ticket out of my rut? I am open to constructive criticism but please be understanding, I was never taught financial literacy of any means so if I sound stupid it’s mostly because I kinda am. I just a guy trying to get his life in order",finance,1662447659

cardano,Overview of Cardano's monetary policy,"Cardano will only have 45,000,000,000 ADA coins. This number is the maximum number of coins and it is important to know that not all of them are in circulation yet. 22.5%, which is approximately 10.13 billion ADA, will be released into circulation through monetary expansion. We can call them reserve or unminted coins. Each epoch a small portion of the reserve is taken and used for staking rewards. A portion will go into the project treasury. This will gradually increase the number of coins in circulation. At the time of writing, there are approximately 34.8 billion ADA coins in circulation.

What happens when the reserve runs out of coins? Where will the coins for staking rewards come from? The scalability and utility of the network are expected to grow over time. The number of fees collected will grow with adoption. A circular economy will emerge in which users pay for the costs of operating and maintaining the network through fees. There will also be enough for staking rewards. 

Let's neglect the treasury and look at staking rewards. Every epoch, approximately 13,000,000 ADA is released for rewards. With a fee of 0.2 ADA per average transaction, this would mean that 65,000,000 transactions would have to be processed per epoch, or about 13,000,000 transactions per day. Cardano's network would have to be able to process 150 transactions per second and that is technologically conceivable within a few years. 

No one can predict the adoption rate. If Cardano gets adopted by 1% of the population, which is 77,000,000 people, and everyone paid one transaction a day, the network would collect over 15,000,000 ADA in fees every day. 

This is a hypothetical example, as the value of ADA coins will likely increase and people will pay fees in stablecoins. At $5 per ADA coin, the 0.2 ADA fee would be $1. At the moment it is difficult to predict what the size of on-chain fees will be and how the situation around the second layers will develop. Either way, the Cardano network has a good chance of making enough to cover the cost of its own operations. The path to economic sustainability for all networks is scalability.

Forex,What does today's RBA decision mean for the Aussie Dollar?,"The Aussie Dollar could continue to face selling pressure despite the RBA’s decision for a fourth consecutive 50bps rate hike earlier today, marking the most aggressive tightening cycle in their history. 

The central bank still expects inflation to surge beyond 7% this year before peaking, which will likely force the central bank to continue raising rates beyond the estimated neutral rate. Now, although the official cash rate still slightly below this level, today’s move may have opened the door for the RBA to begin easing the pace of their rate hikes, and possibly even pause to assess the impacts sooner-rather-later. 

This potential for a dovish pivot could be the reason AUD/USD touched its lowest level since mid-July today, and with expectations for another 75bps hike from the Fed later this month, the pair could find itself at risk of retesting its lows below 0.6700 in the near-term. 

However, all trading carries risk, and with AU GDP data out tomorrow and US CPI due next week, there is still plenty of room to manoeuvre in either direction ahead of the next FOMC Meeting.",finance,1662461893

personalfinance,"Keep a small pension, roll it over, or withdraw?","Looking for some outside perspective... My spouse and I both just changed jobs. We are both vested in a pension plan from our previous employer (the same org) though not for much. I stand to receive about $1,700 monthly after age 60 w/o a survivor option and he is looking at about $1,200. We can also cash out either pension with a 20% federal tax liability. Mine is about $56k and his about $40. We have the option to roll these pensions over into another retirement fund. Both of our current employers offer 403(b) plans with up to a 5% match. Regardless of if we roll over our pension we will both pay into these plans. 

We also are on a timeline to buy a house by summer 2023. We have a young kid and are currently renting. We'd like to have another kid in the next year but can't do it in our current place because of the size - so a lot of big life plans depend on getting a bigger place on a tight timeline. We have a meager savings now and should be in an OK place by next summer. Cashing out one of the pensions, even at a steep penalty, would give us a VERY nice cushion to our savings for a down payment. 

We're debating the best strategy. Keeping the pensions as-is means guaranteed monthly income, but they're not particularly high and obviously need to be supplemented. I'm worried that it's risky to keep them generally - it's a local government sponsored pension and who knows what will happen in 30 years. $3,000 a month is nothing to sneeze at, but again, in 30 years, is it going to help much at all? Particularly since we're still going to pay into two 403(b)s? Cashing one out means losing a LOT of money, but it also could be the difference in us being able to afford a house we want (school district, yard, etc.) versus one we might just live with for a few years. 

If we don't withdraw, rolling the pensions into a 403(b) will let us gain more in interest in the long run but I'm wondering if it's safer to stick with a portion of it as a pension and to supplement it with the rest of our retirement. 

Lots of ways we could do this but I think what I really want to know is... Am I crazy to even think about withdrawing one of our pensions now for a down payment? We still have at least 30 years of work ahead of us, but I don't want to be a total bonehead about our money.",finance,1662469810

personalfinance,"Family fronted cash for house, Bank taking advantage on Mortgage 100.","My SO (22) and I (24) bought our first house last May for $280,000. Due to the market and all the cash offers being accepted, we had a family member who was willing to front the cash, as long as we pulled out a mortgage 6 months ish down the road. We kept the title open for this purpose. 

Here we are 6 months later, the house appraises for $295,000 but now the bank wants us to do a mortgage 100 on the $280,000. We have about $110,000 in stocks that they were going to use as a proof of fund, to lower our interest rate (5.2%), and to avoid PMI. They said they needed an additional $20,000 put it into stocks for the mortgage. We were told we could access it whenever we needed, but now they're saying we cant get it back for at least 6 months. The main problem though, is that they're charging us for all the title fees again, totaling about $20,000 in closing costs. Which would mean that in 6 months we'd pay about $30,000 in closing costs total. 

Other than paying the family member directly, is there a better way to do this for both parties? Thanks!",finance,1662474971
CryptoCurrency,Will this time be the same? The road ahead might be unpredictable. But the end is crystal clear.,"The winter has finally arrived. Stock market is falling like a rock. And crypto market is no difference. In fact, cryptocurrencies have been being traded like tech stocks for several months and not many people want to bet against this trend, at least for now and the next few months. Natually, even the most optimistic people in this space start wondering whether their whole investment thesis is flawed, and this winter will be as long and \*painful\* as it was a few years back.

I think we first have to be realistic. At the time of this writing, macro doesn't look good for high-risk assets in general and cryptocurrencies in particular, and Fed is going to hike rates several times until they finally realized that they have created their own monster during covid time and eventually f\*cked up the whole economy. At the current rate, developing countries &amp; economies will suffer the most due to absurdly high value of the dollar and interest rate. People are all getting poorer and poorer as days passed by.

So will there be any light at the end of the tunnel or this time will just be the same?

I think we can make a good judgement by assessing the maturity of blockchain technologies, the quantity and quality of the decentralized applications built on top of several blockchains, and the amount of capital sitting in the crypto market.

The last winter, we barely had BTC and ETH. Smart contract was still at its infant state which was mainly used to raised fund through ICOs. Now what we have? Several smart contract platforms, each has its own design trade-offs, competing for investment capital and user-base through their innovative and efficient Defi apps, NFTs, etc. Millions of people are using these Dapps in a daily basis for borrowing, lending, trading, and so on. If we look into the current state of the crypto market, we can easily see that: (1) BTC has been losing its market dominance in a remarkably gradual pace, (2) several layer-1 platforms have been eating into Ethereum's pie, and (3) a huge amount of real capital is currently sitting in stablecoin. This last point is essential because it means that smart money has not really left the crypto market. It's there waiting to make the  next big moves to one or several of these platforms. And let's not forget, that is actual money and liquidity.

So yes, I really think that we are in a huge financial and geopolitical crisis right now, but if just we can mindfully manage the risks and navigate through these uncharted waters, we might come out of this with the biggest prizes.

We'll get there.

The 18,559-square-foot estate has been valued at more than $36 million, according to local appraisal records. In an interview with Boca Raton Magazine in 2018, the celebrity physician described the mansion as “our house” and raved about Palm Beach, which he said was “like a playground to me in many ways.”

The opulent Florida property has so far escaped the level of attention given to some of Oz’s other houses, such as the New Jersey mansion where he resided for years until 2020. Oz purchased the mansion in 2015 with the help of Florida attorney Leslie Evans, whom the deed describes as a trustee for the property.

The year before, Evans was involved in the purchase of a foreclosed Connecticut mansion. It was a transaction that became central to federal fraud cases filed in 2018 that saw four other people plead guilty to bilking investors out of millions. 

The group was accused of luring foreign investment in a Palm Beach hotel with the promise of inclusion in the federal EB-5 visa program, which expedites consideration of visa applications for foreigners who contribute at least $500,000 to development projects that create domestic jobs.

The reason for this has to do with Federated FreeBusy. companyA has several domains associated with it and it would be easier to just consolidate to one actual external email address.

personalfinance,How can I find out why my quoted auto loan interest rates are so high?,"Hey all, I've been half heartedly looking to take out an auto loan and have been met with uncomfortably high interest rates. Am I crazy for thinking these are high, if not how can I find out why they're so high?  


Here's me. I'm 23, a Software engineer making 80k(USD) a year. I have a 786 credit score according to Experian. I have 4 years of credit history across two credit cards, a discover and capital one Walmart card (5% back at Walmart? you betcha). Rent is 800/MO. My only debt is in credit cards, and that's not really debt it's just my monthly spending (everything goes on a credit card unless there is a fee), and on a month to month ranges from $300 - $2000. I bank through Wells Fargo which is why they're mentioned a few times below.  


About a year ago (so I only had three years credit history at the time, the above paragraph is otherwise accurate), I was looking for a fun car as an autocross toy and didn't want to spend all my money so I figured I'd finance half of it. I was looking at a 2007 corvette. Wells Fargo denied my loan application, private lenders were quoting me 23% APR, capital one wanted me at 15%, discover said I had to get a personal loan and they tried to get me at 12% APR. Whatever, I figured it was the 22 year old trying to buy a 2007 corvette, opted for a cheaper Hyundai Genesis in cash and moved on with life.  


Now I'm looking for something I can semi routinely drive from southern Missouri to northern Michigan, haul the dog in etc. I found a nice 2018 Toyota going for about 20k. I'd like to put about 10k down and finance the rest. That leaves me with an ample emergency fund, plus with Christmas and most of the families birthdays coming up I'd like to keep a decent savings account balance. At this point the only hard check on my credit ever is last year when I applied for financing on the corvette. Toyota financing, Wells Fargo (personal loan), Discover, Capital One and all the private banks the finance department set me up with all have me around 9-10% still. Applying for third party financing through bulk finders online puts me around 18%! Two guys I lived with in college bought new (brand new) cars this year and got interest rates around 4% with no cosigners, and I see the national average is around 6% currently.  Am I crazy for thinking these are insanely high quotes for someone in my position? Should I be looking at amending my credit history or something? I can't see anything on my report that looks out of place?",finance,1662495750

personalfinance,"Apartment leasing office overcharges me $145 for monthly rent. I ask to cut me a check, they say no, we issue credit to next month's rent. Anything I can do about it?","I live in Texas, and I've been at the same apartment complex for the last 3 years. It's not the greatest, and yet not the worst. (yet) I want to move, but at the moment I'm tackling so many bills, that I can't afford to move anywhere, because somehow everywhere else is more expensive in a 20 mi radius, and I have a kid, who I share custody with. So please don't tell me I should move. Believe me, I want to, I just can't realistically afford it right now without screwing myself over at this time. 

After some confusion with the lease renewal, (they tried out a new software that was glitchy) I signed on for another 12 months. My original lease ends on the 20th, and the new one begins on the 21st. So 20 days of old rent price, and 10 days of new rent price. Well I went to pay my rent online on the evening of the 1st, and noticed it was well off, even with the rent increase. Like by about $145 (almost my electric bill) No biggie, I thought, I'll hop by the leasing office tomorrow and get it sorted out. The next day (Friday Sept 2nd) I stop by around 3pm by the leasing office to complain. Unfortunately anyone with authority to settle the dispute has already left for the day, despite the office closing at 5:30 pm. The staff that is still there takes down my complaint, and says someone should reach out to me later (but they couldn't say when) About 4:30 I get an automated email saying the office will be closed for the weekend, and resume Tuesday, after the holiday. 

I come back Tuesday afternoon, and get them to confirm they overcharged me. They had expected to credit me back for the upcoming month, but I asked them to cut me a check for the amount. They said they couldn't do that, because it had to get approved from corporate, and if it got approved, it would take about 45 days. Normally I wouldn't mind the credit, if the amount was under $50. But l feel that $145 is a significant amount to overcharge, and I could put the money to bills I have to pay this month. I feel like I'm giving them a 30 day interest free loan for $145 without having a choice in the matter. This wouldn't have been a problem (that they created) if they had been appropriately staffed on Friday.

I checked interest rate charts and it seems like this is really about the worst it has been in the last 13 years so think it is a reasonable bet that at some point in the next 10y, I'd be able to catch a significant break from a refinance. Post1971 avg is 7.76%.",finance,1662501205

personalfinance,In dilemma re house ownership.,"Throwaway account for reasons.

1. Friend paid 50% of the 20% downpayment when I bought a house.
2. I am currently living in the house. I pay everything i.e. mortgage, taxes, insurance, hoa, etc.
3. Now friend says he wants 50% of the proceeds when I sell the house.
4. Their name is on the deed, title, mortgage, etc.

Few options points:

1. One option is I move out and we rent the house for the foreseeable future.
2. Second option is I buyout the friend's share for some hefty sum going by the current fair price of the house.
3. Third option is I give in and may be go like 40% and friend gets to use the 1098 towards their deductions.

Any suggestions or advice? It is going to be a tough conversation with the wifey tonight. :(

Update:

1. There was no formal agreement.
2. We are ready to hire a lawyer and come to an agreement that route.
3. I do not want to go to court. I will rather move out.

Update 2:  

1. Can anyone kindly help me run the numbers? Giving up the house for rent and getting another house possibly in next 2-3 years?
2. Assume 40% stake of the other person, the interest rate on the current loan of 30 yrs is 2.5% and no PMI. Let's assume the house price is $700k with 28 yrs remaining on the loan.
3. A new similar house will cost between $80k to $900k with interest rate of 5.3% and PMI plus closing costs.
4. Why similar house? The house is not big or small and the area of living is perfect considering my long term plans.
5. Am I somewhat break even in both the situations? I am trying to run the numbers on my own as well.",finance,1662507856

personalfinance,Purchasing a new home with payment assistance,"Looking for input as to what I could be missing that would make this a bad idea. For background, I (30m) and my wife own our current home and an investment property. We have a 6 month old daughter. Our current home is far too small for our family of 3 and two dogs. The only problem is any larger houses in the area we’d like (good school district) are out of our price range, even after using the ~$400,000 in equity we have built up for a down payment.

My parents recognize that housing prices here are insane, and they want to help us purchase a nice house in a good school district. They have offered $80,000. We found a house we like which is listed for $829,900. This would be a home we stay in for 20+ years. Using my $400,000 down payment, the mortgage payment (with taxes, insurance, &amp; HOA) is $3,000 / month. Adding the $80,000 from my parents decreases that slightly to ~$2,600. The max I’m comfortable paying is $2,250 per month.

Rather than using the $80,000 for the down payment, my parents have offered to give $750 / month for about 9 years to go towards the mortgage payment. After that I’d be responsible for paying for the full mortgage payment.

Initially I was hesitant to accept this offer, because I’d be locking in a mortgage payment that I can’t afford at the moment. However after thinking about it, I realized that in 5 years my wife’s student loans will be forgiven, which is about $400/month (Public Service Loan Forgiveness). Additionally, in about 5 years, our daughter will be out of daycare and in public school. We currently pay $1700/month for daycare. On top of that, I feel fairly confident that interest rates will decline at some point in the next 9 years, allowing us to refinance. Also, my job typically gives 2-3% raises every year which would help.

I currently make $126,000. My wife makes about $90,000.

Is there anything I’m missing where this could bite me in the butt and cause me to regret purchasing this house?


TLDR: interested in buying a house that is currently out of my budget. Parents have offered to give $750/month for up to 8 years to go towards the monthly payments so I can afford it now. I’ve made some assumptions as to how I can afford the extra $750 within 8 years. Is this risky / dumb?",finance,1662519372

stocks,"‘Extreme buyer hesitation’ pushes home sellers to rent instead of sell, and builders see rentals as a hedge against a cooling housing market","Faced with weak demand from home buyers, home builders and sellers are increasing their focus on the rental market. And that’s likely good news for renters. Home sellers are facing a tough market. The 30-year interest rate is sliding past 6%, according to Mortgage News Daily on Tuesday, compounded by recession fears, are holding buyers back. Sellers are, as a result, giving into more concessions. One builder is even offering a “free finished basement.” 

Put off by the softer market, some sellers in the south and the west are instead putting their homes on the rental market. Rick Palacios Jr., research director at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, tweeted. Palacios Jr. said that he’s seeing a surge in sellers shifting from sales to rentals in California due to a rapidly cooling housing market in California, compared to the rest of the country.  “Home prices have been falling for several months now in major California markets, and sellers realize that, so they may be inclined to switch,” he told MarketWatch. Some of these homeowners were hoping to flip their house, but the cooling market is holding them back, he noted. “We know that investor transactions as a percentage of all home sales in places like Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, Sacramento, San Jose, and San Francisco, are all around 20% to 30%,” Palacios Jr. said.

The same trend is playing out among home builders. “There are a lot of builders that believe that the for-rent market can offer a hedge to a slowing housing market,” Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda, told MarketWatch. 

“There are builders that weren’t that active in the for-rent space a couple of years ago that are now working to build single-family homes for rent,” she added, “because they say we can offer the home, the location, the school district in some cases, all to a consumer without them having to worry about the down payment.” Wolf said she’s seeing the pivot happen where land prices are slightly cheaper, and where demand is still strong, like in Phoenix, Ariz., and parts of the south and the midwest.

My only debt is 80k left on the mortgage (house value is ~280k) but my interest rate is so low it doesn’t make sense to me to pay it off. My emergency fund is in good shape. But I have a question I could use some advice on about retirement. 

Current situation: I’m 48 and would like to shoot for retirement in 20 years or so. While earlier would be nice, I have young kids and don’t see it happening. 

Currently I’m:

Maxing IRA contribution.
Maxing out HSA.
Contributing 7% to 401k (company matches up to 5%) invested in a target date index fund. 
Enrolled in company espp plan.
Have brokerage accounts with a 3 fund strategy plus a little play money in individual stocks. 

I have an inherited IRA with an RMD of 13,500 with 8 years left.

I don’t feel like I’m doing enough for retirement. 

I’ve taken two RMD’s from the inherited ira and mostly dumped it into index funds in my brokerage account because I didn’t know what else to do with it. 

The question I would like to ask is would it be better to substantially increase my 401k contributions from my paycheck even though the company only matches 5%? If I go this route I’ll supplement my monthly income from the RMD instead.

But I feel like I don’t have enough information yet to answer that question. So the real question is what more information do I need to figure out the best strategy? 

The 401k and my brokerage accounts are performing roughly the same. Brokerage has a very slight advantage due to some individual stock plays I’ve made.

stocks,(9/7) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Hump Day! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, September the 7th, 2022-

# [Stock futures are flat, weighed down by fears the Fed will keep raising rates aggressively](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Wednesday as investors worry that the Federal Reserve will hand out another large rate hike in September in a bid to tame high inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 86 points, giving up earlier gains. S&amp;P 500 futures also retreated, edging lower by 0.30%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.27%. If the slide continues into the trading day, it could be the eighth negative session in a row for the Nasdaq Composite.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped into negative territory after a Wall Street Journal article suggested that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s commitment to reduce inflation could mean that the central bank hikes rates by 0.75 percentage point in September, which would be the third consecutive increase of that size. Markets have been hoping that the Fed would start to hand out smaller increases starting in September, but are now pricing in an 86% chance of a 0.75 percentage point hike.
*****
&gt; Stocks added to their three-week slide Tuesday. The Dow fell about 173 points, or 0.5%, and the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% to notch its first seven-day losing streak since 2016.
*****
&gt; The moves came amid a surge in bond yields that saw the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jump to its highest level since June. The rate on the 30-year Treasury closed at its highest level since 2014. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Rates dipped slightly Wednesday, with the 10-year trading at 3.321%. The 2-year and 30-year yields traded at 3.47% and 3.472%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors are split on how to approach the market entering the first post-Labor Day week in September, a notoriously cruel month for stocks. All eyes are on the 3,900 level on the S&amp;P 500. Some see the index falling to even lower lows, while others are optimistic about a year-end rally.
*****
&gt; “With equities back to June lows and the rates path reset higher, more inflation easing along with decisive EU government intervention to tackle the energy crisis could prompt another bear squeeze,” Emmanuel Cau of Barclays wrote in a Wednesday note. “Big picture, we think stocks remain in a tough spot given a poor growth-policy trade-off.”
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will give its summary on current economic conditions, also known as the Beige Book. Elsewhere, Fed presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland and Tom Barkin of Richmond, as well as Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard are scheduled to speak at various events.

retirement,"Sale of Primary Home that is eligible for $500,00 exclusion-Is this income as well?","THIS IS REGARDING ACA Health Insurance Income requirements) SOrry

&amp;#x200B;

Hi  there, my husband may have to retire earlier than expected and health  insurance will be a concern for 1-3 years (we are not sure at what point).  We are considering selling  our primary home and moving to a rental in a LCOL area in the same state.  Any gains would be exempt from federal taxation.  I am reviewing  the ACA site and they list capital gains as included in reportable  income. I know income in in our roll-over IRA is reportable even if it is tax-exempt, so I highly suspect a primary home sale would be included.

I am trying to consider the timing factor. Sure wish I had a crystal ball right now.

btc,"Formula to calculate half-life of BCH Hedge, paying monthly txn fees + interest rate (Hedge rate), incl. Python code. $10 halves in 27 years, paying 0.2%/month.","`HalfLife = log((A₀/2+Fee/r)/(A₀+Fee/r))/log(1-r)/12`

`An = (A₀+Fee/r)(1-r)^(12n)-Fee/r`

    from math import log
    def HalfLife(A0,Fee,r): return log((A0/2+Fee/r)/(A0+Fee/r))/log(1-r)/12
    def An(A0,Fee,r,n): return (A0+Fee/r)*(1-r)**(12*n)-Fee/r

where `A₀` is initial Amount ($ or BCH), `Fee` is the total txn fees per month, `r` is the decimal monthly interest rate, &amp; `An` is the amount after `n` years.

**Edit**: There may be an extra fee, maybe `.2%=.1%+.1%`, for opening &amp; closing a large Hedge. Bulls may instantly trade when a large contract is opened/closed, suffering an ask/bid spread.

[Here](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/pz23yseh358gcjqjwafxu75umemmnprf2yjf2e8rp7) is an AnyHedge Contract address whose history consists of making &amp; exiting a Hedge. It's under 1kB, so `Fee` is **0.11** cents if that's all which is required every month. Some months may require multiple Hedges though if a stop-loss is triggered (protection against faulty price or scam oracles).

But what rate `r`? Assuming Bitcoin Cash being used as a BTC Cash payment system achieves the lowest possible rate, maybe 0.2%/month (`r=.002`). That's 2.4% p.a. to cover the BCH Bulls' trading expenses. A Bull could sell half his BCH for BTC &amp; go 2x long on the other half, earning 2.4% p.a. yield. But maybe people Hedge en masse if BCH/BTC is obviously about to go down. Every market-take requires paying a spread, btwn bid &amp; ask, &amp; so 2.4% p.a. may not be sufficient. Maybe 0.5%/month is more realistic, &amp; it's variable. Above 2%/month is considered usury, unless it's a Hedge-rate.

Speaking of $ is a little misleading, but what could be most popular is a BCH Hedge to BTC (**S**tore-**o**f-**V**alue) using $ as the Unit-of-Account! The wallet value does whatever BTC's price does, but we count it in $, even though it's all on BCH's blockchain. BCH can be thought of as a **H**edge-**t**o-**V**alue, the **V**alue **H**edged **t**o everything else.

What is a reasonable amount? $1, **$10** &amp; $100 have half-lifes 16, **27** &amp; 29 years. So $10 is a reasonable Hedge, but $1 isn't necessarily enough to cover the 0.11c fees. However if BCH price went up (e.g. 10x) the minimum amount would 10x too. To calculate in Electron Cash console:

    HalfLife(1,.0011,.002)
    HalfLife(10,.0011,.002)
    HalfLife(100,.0011,.002)

To check the $10 half-life, enter

    An(10,.0011,.002,26.7)

Unfortunately BCH currently doesn't support Hedging with variable maturity, imho. I've been [discussing](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/op-get-current-block-height/533/8?u=tinos) the issue over at BitcoinCashResearch. A new OpCode, `OP_CHECKBLOCKHEIGHTVERIFY` (with 6-conf lock, OP\_CBHV) would guarantee Hedge can Exit whenever they want without Bull's signature.

I doubt AnyHedge will achieve mass-adoption without a new OpCode. If BCH could enable grocery &amp; fuel money to be Hedged to BTC (or XAU, etc) then maybe. However without OP\_CBHV a smartphone would have to keep re-Hedging every few hrs &amp; the person has to predict a few hrs in advance to disable the auto-re-Hedge. Also, a multisig escrow is inconvenient because escrow+vendor have to keep signing each re-Hedge since a shipment could take any amount of time. We can't write a BCH Script which determines the block-height of the blockchain without a new OpCode. AnyHedge might still work if the Bulls are always online to **auto-sign** the Hedge-Exit (to pay for groceries instantly, etc). Like a LightNing channel, a trusted counterparty should be required.

Instead of the BCHN full node wallet Hedging to BTC the way it should, CashTokens could enable it to hodl some official BTC CashToken (yield bearing?). The wallet isn't necessarily valid if its value isn't linked to BTC. That's if it's mining Bitcoin, using the same PoW. It deserves Bitcoin's actual value.

If Satoshi wanted to fork his own chain, surely he'd Hedge the new full node wallet to BTC. His whitepaper seems consistent with Bitcoin being both a **S**tore-**o**f-**V**alue &amp; a **H**edge-**t**o-**V**alue. BCH can enable Bitcoin's true value to be spread to the masses in a decentralized way. It's an alternative to the LightningNetwork which may be cheaper if the Hedge rate is low enough. Only BCH/BTC price oracle/s would be needed by the nodes.

An analogy is if a USD balance at PayPal were only ever representative of PYPL shares, + Hedge to USD. If PYPL goes down, more shares are owed, with final settlement in PYPL - sold at the stock exchange. It'd be a way for PayPal to avoid banking directly - the stock brokers handle that. But there could be a monthly rate paid to the PYPL Bull. 😉",cryptocurrency,1662554749

CryptoCurrency,"People need to accept the harsh reality that crypto isn’t likely to be pumping anytime soon, and it’s because of interest rate hikes across the world.","The world isn’t exactly in great shape. Inflation has been soaring across the globe, and to combat it governments have increased interest rates. Over 45 countries are doing it, to be precise. 

In environments where rates are low and money flows, it’s often called *loose monetary policy*. And in economic climates where rates are raised, we call in *tightening*. 

When we are loosey goosey with rates, investments tend to do well because capital flows more freely as loans and collateral are easier to afford. 

When rates get tight and start to bite, it’s harder to spend as freely and borrowing becomes harder. Basically, there’s less money and less volume in markets. 

Right now, countries across the world are furiously raising interest rates to combat inflation. It’s one of the swiftest money tightening cycles ever, and throw in some war and post pandemic recovery, and things look dicey to say the least. 

Crypto is awesome, I love it, we all do! But it’s not exactly a blue chip stock, it’s a speculative asset, and the risk of that makes it a *no no* in a world where we are **tightening** our belts and being wary of rate rises. 

Eventually, we will get things under control and rates will be eased and lowered. When this happens, governments, businesses, and people who tightened their purses during rate rises find opportunities and optimism to spend their money again - much of that money finds its way into the market, and to crypto. 

I have no doubt the next bull run will be epic. However, I think you are very optimistic to think it will happen in the midst of such a historic monetary tightening environment. 

Naturally, I could be very wrong. But the obscure technical analysis appearing lately to provide hopium hasn’t convinced me otherwise yet. 

TL:DR - Interest rates are climbing across the world, which is bad for investments and will inhibit the potential for a new crypto bull run. When looser monetary policy begins the bulls will rise once more, but not a moment before.",cryptocurrency,1662561752

personalfinance,Popular Personal Finance Advice vs the Professors (online research article),"from the national bureau of economic research, this paper reviews many of the financial books that are mentioned in this sub every week. It looks at many of the claims from the books and compares them to academic economists' views on the topics. for example, JL Collins is called out specifically for dismissing international stocks in his book. Dave Ramsey called out for not paying off highest interest rates first.

It also points out that savings rates should vary at different ages, but most of these self help books recommend smoothed amounts. This is the main contrast, in that the academic authors think that people are needlessly punishing themselves by trying to save too much while young and missing out on life to meet some long term ambiguous savings rate.

an interesting read, and most of us will likely have read some of the books mentioned in the research. I encourage everyone to skim through this and pick out some of the points they find relevant to themselves.

personalfinance,Do I Refinance or Sell My Car?,"Hello everyone, I need some money advice.

In July I had to fight a stupid lawsuit in court here in colorado.  I won the case, but now am stuck with over $8,500 in lawyer fees.  I tried to get the plaintiff to have to pay for it, but because of the type of case, I couldn't recoup those fees. 

Here is my question, what would you guys do to find $8,500 in my assets to pay this money?

I currently own an apartment.  I paid $242,500 in June 2020 and it is now valued around $310,000 - $325,000.  I did have to take out a second that is around $10,000, so if I did a cash-out refi that would be paid first.  My current interest rate is 3.25%. 

I also lease a Toyota that is currently valued at $22,000 and I only owe $12,000 on the car.  

I have no money in savings.  I had a stroke at the beginning of the year and the medical costs have depleted my savings. 

I only have around $15,000 in my retirement account, and can't access that money unless I quit or borrow against it.

I have amazing credit ~810-820

I make around $26/hr and work in government. I could be working at a much higher earning potential, but because of my health conditions and the age of my kid, I've chosen to work an easier job that doesn't have a large earning potential.

Here are the ultimate questions:
#1 - Do I refinance and pay for it that way?  I could take out enough to replace my furnace and pay off my car, but with interest rates so high, I am too scared to do this. 
 
#2 - Do I trade my car for another cheaper car and have no car payment?  I could then use the money I paid towards my car payment to pay off the $8,500 over the next few months/years. I pay $420/month for my car and the interest rate is 3.85%

#3 - Do I just suck it up and get a different job and pay for this like I would pay down a credit card?

Aside from my mortgage and car payment, I have no other debt except for this new amount.  I usually never carry any debt (aside from home and car) and I'm struggling with what is the best financial decision. I like my job and don't want to feel like I have to quit.  I am currently strapped with my monthly budget and this new cost will eliminate all of my disposable income because of a new monthly payment.

Please be nice.  I know I don't have a ton of money, but I'm a single woman who paid for college on my own, bought a home on my own, and am trying to keep my sh!t together. I would just like to know what all of you would do. Thanks everyone",finance,1662570291

Avax,Subnets vs Sidechains,"There are many ways in which blockchains choose to scale their networks. Each with their own unique take on how to solve the trilemma. Here we are discussing the differences between Avalanche Subnets and blockchain sidechains.

**Finality**

Subnets are completely sovereign and don't share their state with the Primary Network so transactions are final and immutable in less than 2 seconds w/the Avalanche Consensus.

Sidechains need to continuously send a checkpoint/save state to the 'parent' chain (Polygon to Ethereum, for example). Transactions on sidechains are not final until the checkpoint is accepted and finalized on the parent chain. So it must be recorded on the sidechain, then sent to the ‘parent’ chain which must then also record it. This leaves a point of failure where a chain may experience a reorg, as a failsafe.

**Speed**

Subnets transactions do not affect the speed of the Primary Network, and the Primary Networks transactions do not affect the speed of the Subnet transactions. Both are allowed to operate at maximum speed without affecting one another.

Sidechains transactions are not affected by the ‘parent’ chain and likewise the other way around. This allows both to work at their optimal speeds. However, gas price fluctuations on the ‘parent’ chain can affect the speed of checkpointing, and congestion can prevent them altogether.

**Validators**

Subnet nodes are REQUIRED to validate the Primary Network, thereby creating a common coordination environment. This can be used for registering metadata, check-pointing proofs, atomic transfers, and other similar uses. 

Not all sidechains use the same nodes as their parent chain but can, depending on the sidechain. 

**Flexibility**

Subnets provide maximum flexibility. You are free to create your own economics (such as custom tokens for gas), security, and also your choice of VM (virtual machine). So a project is not handcuffed to only using the Primary Network’s tokenomics and technical structure. This allows projects to customize all aspects of their environment. This means you can use other execution environments besides the EVM. Also Subnets can be permissioned or permissionless.

Sidechains, however, require users to use their token for gas, their VM, and abide by their security structure.

**Security**

Subnets have the added benefit of being risk isolated from the Primary Network since subnets don't share their state with the Primary Network. They don’t share risk with  other Subnets either. 

With Subnets, if the Primary network were to be maliciously attacked and successful in the attack, it will not affect the Subnet.

[Avalanche](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Avalanche?src=hashtag_click) security is parameterizable. The safety threshold is at 80% (59% of nodes can be ""Byzantine""). In e.g. Ethereum the threshold is 50% (33% Byzantine).

Sidechains that are compromised will not affect their ‘parent’ chain. However, if the ‘parent’ chain is affected, the sidechain will be impacted as well.

**OTHER**

**How many Subnets can you have?**

Unlike other networks, Subnets are not limited. Anyone can build a subnet, no need for auction slots or limited caps.

investing,Retail concompetitive T-Bill auctions vs SGOV etf,"In the recent past, T-bills seemed pretty useless because they paid zero interest. Now they seem to be far better than savings accounts and money market accounts, and possibly outperforming bank CD's.

I'm going to ignore ""treasury direct"" so please consider it off topic.

There seem to be two remaining popular ways to get t-bill interest rate:

1. Buy T-Bills via a retail brokerage; seems like you have to use a ""non-competitive"" bid, which is basically a blind bid with a surprise interest rate ""discount"". 
2. Buy a t-bill ETF such as SGOV

What are the upsides for parking fiat between those two methods ?

My guess is the advantages are

T-bills:

* State Tax advantages for directly owning t-bills vs getting dividends via an ETF
* No expense ratio, so you get those last few basis points
* No risk of the price dropping like mad

ETF:

* works like autopilot so you dont have to manage it
* Not having aas much downtime for your fiat pile between t-bills when they expire till the next auction
* Can sell anytime with less overhead

Despite significant recent gains in residential solar in the state, the California Solar Initiative’s Single-family Affordable Solar Homes (SASH) Program is currently closed to new applications.  The program apparently has been allowed to expire without a renewal.

The SASH program was responsible for over 9,600 installed PV systems representing over 30 MW of solar capacity with about $138 million in incentives.

In addition, local cities are still allowed to institute regressive anti-solar policies.  For example, in the city of Colton where I'm considering adding a new solar system, they have a blanket maximum limit of 2 watts per square foot, with no oversizing allowed.  

They also require the last 12 months of consumption data as a limit, even if it's a completely unreasonable and inaccurate condition to project future consumption and savings in many common scenarios.   I've owned the house for many years, but due to Covid and other family health issues, the property was vacant for the last 2 years, so last year's consumption can't possibly be reasonable for future PV sizing, especially if I want to make best use of low-income solar subsidies.

These kinds of local restrictions seem to sabotage the potential benefits of the new Federal solar incentives.

Does anybody know if SASH may be renewed or a similar program approved to replace it anytime soon?",energy,1662587869

vet,Sibling cat sudden fear/aggression,"Hi,

I have been to see my local vet this morning just a matter of hours ago, but I'm really interested in as many professional opinions as I can gather.  
I have two lovely indoor cats, sisters coming up six years old, DSH rescues, Lady and Nymeria. They've been indoor cats all their lives, and always lived together, in a few different setups throughout the years but generally studio apartment sized and style. They've always shared food from their bowl, but have a variety of different sleeping spaces and toys that are sometimes shared sometimes used alone. Essentially I've never had behaviour issues with them as a pair beyond the occasional ""she groomed me too much"" brief spat.  
Over the course of the day yesterday, between me leaving for work with both happily in proximity of each other on the bed making biscuits, and coming home, suddenly its like Lady is absolutely terrified of her sister, to the point where if she even sees her she does the 4am catfight yowl. I quickly separated them and fed separately, then tried to get through the night after concluding neither were at all physically hurt and that an after hours vet was not going to change anything immediately at least. Didn't sleep much, over the night several extreme screaming matches broke out, no physical violence although I do think that things very much could get physical if I weren't intervening. Throughout the night Lady was very clearly incredibly fearful, she's sticking to a corner of the kitchen, didn't touch water and only really licked the jelly from her jellymeat, did not bathroom at all through the night but did finally brave her litter box (I have put one on each side of the space for each cat) in the morning. Nymeria has been a bit frightened by the extreme responses and has spent quite a significant portion of time under the couch, she'll come out for me but if Lady can see Nymeria she hisses and does the very severe yowl, which gets worse if she can see me near Nymeria. Out of both trying not to be the worst flatmate in history and trying to keep stress levels as low as possible for both, I'm letting Nymeria to her own devices behind the couch with her own separate food/water and litter tray as best as I can.  
Having gone straight to the vet this morning, Lady has been prescribed Noroclav as an antibiotic, she has previously had UTI problems and both the vet and I have considered that Lady is potentially behaving how she is as a pain response, although I am somewhat sceptical given that she's still very receptive to me patting her, it seems to be exclusively her sister that is frightening and stressing her. She's also been given clomicalm, a larger dosage given by my vet hours ago as well as 5 days for me to give starting tomorrow. As of yet I can't say it seems like she's at all calmer since our vet visit and being given that.  
For lack of a better short way to describe, it's like Lady suddenly doesn't recognize Nymeria at all, she's behaving how I would expect she would if some strange cat she doesn't know was suddenly in her house with her.

My base annual pay is $98k.

Safe to say that I will make more than $98k a year but i cant accurately predict it because on occasion my schedule encounters interuptions or I get sick, etc. I work and live in CA. 

My company matches 50% of every dollar I contribute into my 401k Roth up to the federal limit. Last couple of pay checks I put away between $700 - $800 which the company then matched 50% of. My contribution amount is 15% of each paycheck with an additional 7.5% from the company for effectively a 22.5% contribution rate. I'm using this to play catch up as I've never had such a great match before. I just turned 28 and only have roughly $36k in my 401k so far and $20k in the bank. I know I'm behind....

My son is quite young currently but I want to give him a bedroom, a yard, and space to stretch out and play more as he gets older. I also consider a house and a retirement asset, especially a paid off one.

personalfinance,If you need to add an income source on mortgage preapproval- do you have to do the entire application over again or can they edit it?,"Primary reason for getting preapproved ASAP now is because rates are projected to go up even higher. My husband accepted a signed job offer as a new grad in a different city. We thought we could get preapproved with that but just by googling it looks like he has to wait until the background check, drug test, security clearance and until he has a written and signed start date. But things are moving slow and steady (it’s defense) 
It is looking like the start date won’t be for another 2 months. So in the meantime, we were hoping to get preapproved to lock in a rate for 60-90 days or so. My husband has steady income as a disabled veteran ($900/month) that counts toward a mortgage. We could get preapproved with that I know for sure. But once he has the signed job offer- could we add that to the application? Or would they have to do a whole new application? Important because again we want to lock in the interest rate ASAP.  
Right now income is at $900/month, new job is $88k/year, we obviously need the income from the new job to get preapproved for the amount we need for a house.
Or- if we did preapproval with our current income and have that locked in as low as we can- do you think once we have that job income other lenders would match it or try to beat it? Or would they know that our preapproval and interest rate was only based on our $900/month income. 
Thank You in advance! ☺️
Also- 0 debt, husband graduated with no student loans and we have $17 saved (EDIT: 17k aha) (we had 25k, but job search took a few months longer than expected and our rent here went up from 1,400/month to 2,119/month + utilities right before he graduated and obviously that’s a lot) also, credit scores are 740 &amp; 790. Will get a VA loan with 0 down most likely but planning on attacking the mortgage off within 5 years.
Also, for anyone wondering, I am full time mama and caretaker for the kids, although $900 may seem concerning and that one of us should immediately start working somewhere right this instant, we finally have some down time as a family all together (and I finally have some help!) and I know once he starts working that is going to be mostly gone again.

*So yes, you have time to go solar and get locked into NEM 2 for 15 or 20 years. But I would hurry because that 120-day window is likely but not law (yet).*

# AB 2143

This bill was amended and passed. The only thing that can stop it is a veto by Governor Newsom. 

First, I just want to state clearly that I am all for higher wages. Paying installers a good wage for getting up on your roof and installing panels in the rain up to triple-digit heatwaves is one of the best things companies and customers can do to make sure that hard-working, motivated, and skilled installers and electricians are doing good work that will last 25-30 years. 

But this bill is about putting solar out of reach for most Commerical and Industrial (C&amp;I) customers like apartment complexes, nonprofits, businesses, hospitals, co-ops, farms, volunteer organizations, churches, and community solar projects. They amended the part where if there is a clerical error or omission the customer permanently loses their NEM status. Now only if there are willful violations.... the customer loses their NEM status. So the victim is punished for past workforce decisions made by a 3rd party they did most likely not know about. If that seems needleless unfair and unprecedented, it's because it is.

Weirdly, actual public works projects are exempt from this bill. So if your city puts solar on the fire station, they would be exempt which is completely counter to the idea that this is about public works. And I will point out that with the Inflation Reduction Act, non-profits and governmental organizations now qualify for the Investment Tax Credit. Rules for thee but not for me! Modular/manufactured homes are also now exempt from this bill so manufacturers can get the credit for pre-installing solar on mass-produced homes. My guess is someone in the Senate has an investment in Boxabl or a similar company. 

To be clear, there is a big difference between prevailing wages and union wages. If C&amp;I solar installers hired people from the utility workers union, they would still have onerous reporting, audits, and be subject to two different departments with oversight into projects and labor documentation. Which is a recipe for disaster because there will likely be two different, potentially conflicting standards being enforced between two state organizations (CPUC and the CA Department of Industrial Relations). And just the idea that NEM status can be completely revoked up to 5 years after the project completion means financial institutions would have no interest in financing California C&amp;I projects that could suddenly become unprofitable, forcing the customer to make payments on a 10-30 year agreement that could bankrupt them and risk the financial stability of the lender. 

One of the big reasons why public works projects pay prevailing wages is the fact that with taxpayer-funded projects, the government doesn't mind spending extra money on labor because they can recapture a percentage in the form of taxes. And the more you pay them, the more money, and a larger percent of that money gets recaptured by the government. For federal projects, if the government pays someone $150k, which puts that worker in the 24% income tax bracket which means they will recapture say about 20% after deductions, credits, etc. So the federal government gets about $30k in taxes at the end of the year to use on other projects. Plus with higher wages, they get to command the labor market and incentivize individuals and companies to make these projects a priority. 

With state projects, especially in California, there are even more incentives. Pay someone a prevailing wage, and the state recaptures a percentage in income tax. That worker also generates state and local sales taxes and property taxes. Their employer pays state business taxes. Plus higher paid workers help stimulate their local economy generating more taxes for the state. 

This is fantastic, especially for these prevailing wage workers, their families, and their communities. But not when there are no public funds involved, so the cost for all these great perks is put on customers (aka taxpayers) because businesses will not eat the approximately 25% increase in cost to pay the workers plus all the backend administration required not to have their customer's NEM agreement axed down the line. 

But none of that matters if this bill just makes C&amp;I projects unfinanceable in California. No one will be making those wages. But the utilities will benefit because C&amp;I projects make up about a third of the renewables market in California, a number that is sure to skyrocket now that California actually has a community solar program. 

The author of this bill, Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo is very anti-rooftop solar and very friendly with the Investor Owned Utility Companies. They could have provided additional state funds to make this bill makes sense. Put in reasonable punishments for developers who do not follow the law but don't go punishing customers for parts of the project they are not directly responsible for. But this was about killing a third of the solar projects in the state at the behest of the Investor Owned Utilities under the guise of better wages. 

Suppose Assemblymember Carrillo wanted better wages for solar workers. In that case, she should have just expanded AB 257 (which she coauthored and would be familiar with the text) to allow for sectoral bargaining for the solar industry workers as well as the fast food industry workers. But this is not about good wages. This is just about killing off C&amp;I solar projects to protect IOU profits. 

Since the bill passed and cannot be amended to be reasonable, the only thing left is to call Governor Newsom and ask him to veto this bill to protect the expansion of solar in California.  You can leave a message at 916-445-2841.

# SB 846

This bill extended the life of the Diablo Nuclear plants for 6-7 years and was paid for with a gross power consumption tax, which would have included adding a second consumption meter or basing consumption off of your system's estimated production. This would mean all power you consumed whether it came from the utility or directly from your solar panels, home battery, or generator would be taxed. 

Fortunately, the bill was amended to state that the fee would be added only based on utility power consumed. No tax on solar power produced and consumed on-site without ever being rolled onto the grid. So everyone is getting an extra line item on their utility bill rather than a bigger rate hike to pay for all the temporary diesel generators (with waived emissions caps) that would have been required to make up for the lost generation. 

The bill has been passed.

# Conclusion

Lots of developments to keep up on lately, so I'll be sticking around for a few hours to answer questions. This will probably be my last policy update (barring any big unexpected developments) until the NEM 3 proposal drops at the end of the month. I am entertaining some ideas about doing a live chat or something like that the day it drops rather than just sticking with a massive wall of text reaction like my first NEM 3 post. Let me know your thoughts about that as well. 

Stay safe out there everyone and bring on the questions!",energy,1662601146

From what I remember I believe it will be around 60k — but, I am about 10-12k deep in credit card debt. Im really struggling to pay off my credit card debt because of interest rates and then also having a $300 car payment isn’t helping (before Covid hit the $300 payment was fine). I haven’t seen any sort of articles about this online, but what is the best way to go about eliminating my cc debt and going to nursing school at the same time? I think it’ll be very difficult to continue working the 30+ hours I’m working now while attending nursing school (especially when they recommend you don’t work at all) and that’s the only way I’m able to pay off my bills plus a little more on top of that. I’ve been putting off nursing school for a while, I don’t want to keep putting it off. Is there a way I can pull out a loan for both and then repay it after nursing school? I know there are debt consolidation loans but I would still need to have enough money each month to repay it and I don’t think I will be able to. Any advice is appreciated!

Anyway, my monthly payment amount is $349 and honestly, in this economy, it would be dope to save a little money. 

I tried to refinance a year and a half ago, but I owed more on my car than it was worth, so my bank wouldn't approve it. That isn't the case anymore since the car market is having a stroke.

I know they’re fixed but are they significantly lower than going conventional? Or FHA?

personalfinance,"Upcoming major repair, pay off a different loan to save on interest or keep the liquid cash?","So we’ve got a crack in a wall and foundation slab at one end of the house. It’s going to be expensive, don’t know exactly how bad. Hoping to spend a little more than the bandaid and fix up the room on that end of the house anyway to give us more living space while we’re basically rebuilding it already. But still trying to line up engineers and contractors. No availability around my area, so the repair is probably months out minimum. 

I did a cash out refinance when interest rates were %2.65. I also have a 12k old credit union loan at %2.99 I could pay off with the cash for the repair, but without an idea of how much it will really cost, I’m pretty sure I’ll need it as cash. 

Any advice? We don’t have a lot of income to slosh around. 3100 monthly net income. 1800 house. 150 a month for the credit union loan. Cell phones are 75. One car and it is paid off. Child care is 200 a month. No balance on credit cards but monthly expenses (everything from food to auto pay utilities) are usually between 600-1000 (so a little extra one month just ends up being used up a few months later). Just had a hospital bill and dipped into that repair money. It just keeps chipping away as we wait for a contractor to tell us how much we need for the house repair. 

Mostly want to know if paying off a 2.99 loan is better or keeping all the cash out liquid. I feel like the answer is be cautious until I have a quote because I can’t quickly replace the cash on hand with our low income.",finance,1662621112
economy,Sweden and the fiscal policy,"As you know, inflation is currently noticeable. There are relevant objections that argue that it is not due to an overheated economy (but war, supply disruptions, etc.), and therefore cannot be fought with interest rate increases.  What I think is clear when we have lived with inflation for at least six months is that the Swedish central bank's hawkish comments for a long time are not directly reflected in reality.  

The policy rate is 0.75%, compare for example with the USA at 2.33%. It is interesting to think about this. Doesn't Stefan Ingves ( head of the central bank) believe in higher interest rates for reduced inflation? If that is the case, it is not something he is open with.  What we can ascertain is that those who suffer from inflation are those with small margins, where increased food/fuel prices hit the wallet directly. If we think of the upper middle class in Stockholm with high leverage, modest interest rate increases are of course welcome. They are not affected as much by a few thousand more in food costs and they are perhaps not dependent on cars to the same extent.  I therefore see that an inability to seriously raise the interest rate will further increase the gaps in society. Large parts of the middle class will slip down and get the same standard as those on welfare, despite maybe 2 full-time jobs. This as the welfare  cheques have already been inflation adjusted without there being any guarantees regarding future salary movements.

cardano,How Cardano can be upgraded,"At the time of writing, 95% of nodes are ready for Vasil upgrade. You can check the current status on Cexplorer:  [https://cexplorer.io/versions](https://cexplorer.io/versions)

Hard forks allow major changes to the protocol rules. In a decentralized network, the majority of people running nodes must agree to the change. Therefore, synchronization is necessary. The team creates a new version of the client that includes the changed protocol rules. People running nodes must install the new version if they agree to the changes. If they do not agree to the changes, they can continue to run the old version of the client. 

Let's talk a bit about the protocol upgrade process. Most blockchains must be forked to enable updates. This can be quite a disruptive process that can result in forked currencies or ghost chains. Users are often faced with many questions regarding the following: What the update means for their asset holdings? Do exchanges and wallets support the update? Will the hard fork lead to network downtime? 

Usually, a hard fork requires a sequence of the following steps. The pre-fork blockchain protocol stops operating temporarily. New changes and rules to the protocol are implemented. The post-fork blockchain restarts with the new rule changes. After the upgrade, two different blockchains can exist. One with the old rules and one with the new rules. 

Cardano’s hard fork combinator is designed to streamline the network’s updates without requiring network stoppages or restarts. It does this by combining pre-fork and post-fork blocks for a transition period. The combinator allows for maintaining one continuous blockchain. Cardano’s hard fork combinator combines blocks rather than diverges the old blockchain with the new blockchain. This can be achieved without sacrificing the continuity of user experience or causing network interruption of any kind. There is no blockchain split after the hard fork combinator event. No new ADA coins, no new tokens, etc. 

The IOG team took a completely innovative approach to hard forks and did not allow the creation of forked blockchains with new coins. In doing so, decentralization has not been sacrificed. Node operators are free to choose their client version.

For a hard-fork event to occur, 75% of the block producers must signal support for the new rules. Signaling is enabled by installing a new version of the client. It is possible to publicly track how many nodes have installed the new version and what percentage of blocks are created by the new client version. 

In addition to the support of pool operators, other conditions can be defined to trigger a hard fork event. For example, the support of large exchanges. 

Initiating a hard fork event can be considered a vote for change. The team cannot arbitrarily change the protocol rules without the consent of the pool operators and all stakeholders. Note the difference between Cardano and Bitcoin.

The team can change the protocol rules at any time. These changes may concern critical parts such as monetary policy. There is some social contract between the team and users that the team will not change important rules without debate and approval from the community.

For PoW networks, voting is done via hash rate. Only miners decide on the change. BTC holders cannot participate in the voting unless they operate an ASIC miner. The dominant miners in the network have a major influence. So a relatively small group of people. 

In the Cardano ecosystem, all ADA holders make the decisions. ADA holders delegate coins to a pool of their choice. If a pool behaves differently than delegators expect, they can delegate coins to another pool at any time. This is quite crucial because the reason to delegate coins elsewhere may also involve voting to change the protocol rules. If delegators disagree with the new rules they will delegate ADA to pools that refuse to install the new client version. The stake of all delegators has decision-making power. 

While only miners vote in the PoW networks, all ADA holders can vote in the Cardano network. Pool operators can only vote on the change through their own coins. The total stake of the pool, i.e. the number of blocks the pool produces, depends on the stake of all delegators. The distribution of decision-making power is more fairly distributed in Cardano than in PoW networks.",cryptocurrency,1662624375
personalfinance,US Bank charging interest on all purchases after 0% balance transfer promo,"Hey, folks!

Last month, I took advantage of a 16-month 0% balance transfer promotion on my US Bank Credit Card. I transferred $15k of my $19k limit from some student loans with 8-9% interest. I have a pretty good job but a lot of debt, so this is one of the ways I've found to manage interest rates while being able to also start putting money in a savings account for emergencies. I planned to pay it off in full in 16 months.

In the month since then, I made around $8k in purchases **and made payments to offset them** and keep the total balance at $15k (my balance transfer amount) throughout the month.

When I received my statement yesterday, I saw that I was charged interest on all of my purchases for the month and my **balance transfer amount** has decreased by the $8k I have paid (for my purchases).

I feel scammed... If I can't put money towards my purchases, I assume they'll just continue accruing interest until the balance transfer amount is paid off? Is my only option to avoid paying more interest to pay the whole thing off this month?



**UPDATE:**

Thanks for the replies!

While this appears to be common practice, the language in the terms for various companies' balance transfers seems purposefully misleading. Even though this got down voted hard, I hope someone sees it in the future before they end up paying a transfer fee only to find they now have to pay off the debt immediately anyways in order to keep using the card at all...",finance,1662627034

computers,HP ProBook 645 G4,"Hello! Honestly I've pretty much given up on ever getting this piece of junk to work, but might as well ask for help here. So here's the deal. I got this computer from school 3 years ago. Brand new, flawless condition. During my school years it got a bit problematic already. It sometimes froze for no reason. After turning it on and off again (yes, I have tried it), it worked like a charm. Later on, maybe last year or so, this became a daily occurence. But as I said, I just had to reboot it and it worked. Oh yeah and it stopped after like half a year I think. 

Until like a month ago. One day I left it on in my room while I went somewhere for a few hours, on accident, but I think a laptop should be able to handle that. Well, after I got home I tried to use it and once again it has frozen, nothing worked. So I turned it off, expecting the old problem to have just returned. Oh how wrong I was...

After I turned it on, I was greeted with a beep (like when you enter the BIOS), but it was actually an error screen. The text says: ""HP Sure Start Recovery: HP Sure Start detected an unauthorized change to the Secure Boot Keys. The keys were restored automatically and there is no further action required. The repeated occurence of this problem indicates a security problem that should not be ignored.""My choices are either ""Esc"" or ""OK"". Whichever I press, it starts to turn on, only to shut off. Then turn itself on again, ending up in the same god damn screen. No difference. 

Alright, next logical step is obviously to Google this error message and what I can do. Trying every button combination under the sun, Windows + V + power, Windows + B + power, F10, F9, Formula 1 etc. Nothing. Then I try downloading a BIOS reset thingy onto a flash drive, plug it in... No reaction. God dammit. Out of options, I throw it to a local electronics shop. They get nothing done on it, and I waste weeks of my time waiting for a call from there because for some reason they don't call you, you have to call them????? Rant over. 

Today I got my computer back from there. I decided to take fixing it into my own hands. Or... my friends' hands, I know jack shit about computers. So, we gather around and try and see what's wrong with it. My friend has a flash drive with a new Windows installed. We try that, try pressing random keys such as F9, F10, ESC, I seriously don't know how, but we got in. We got in the fucking BIOS!!! Then... we seriously fucked up. Thinking it would be easy enough to change some boot settings (sorry, I don't remember which ones, pretty sure they were in the advanced category), we just hastily saved the changes and exited the BIOS. 

I wouldn't be making this post if this did work. It didn't. And we never managed to replicate the way we stumbled upon the answer. So we decided to crack that bad boy open. The objective: Resetting the CMOS battery. Us being idiots and not having a clue where the hell it is, we did so much unnecessary work trying to get it removed. The plug was very much visible. We just didn't know that and followed the manual on how to remove it completely. Well, we did and that also did nothing. Fucking great. Try it a few more times, made sure we properly waited for like a good handful of minutes before plugging it in. Still the same problem. 

One thing we couldn't do was short-circuiting the CMOS battery. Apparently that's a thing you can easily do for a PC, but we really couldn't figure out how to do that for a laptop. Was that one thing we couldn't do really our golden ticket, or is there some other seperate problem? Did the BIOS not reset itself, or what's going on? I'm seriously fed up with this piece of crap and I'll buy a new one next year anyway but I still kinda wish it would work. Hopefully my description was extensive enough, I couldn't add pictures. Maybe I should do it through imgur or something, I've never used it though. Yeah, I'm not expecting much out of this but thanks in advance! 

TLDR: When you turn the computer on, it goes to an error screen from which you cannot progress. Tried every button combination and even opened the laptop and unplugged the CMOS battery but nothing has changed. Short-circuiting it is the only thing I haven't tried.",technology,1662629207

personalfinance,Flowchart Revamp Project,"So we all know and love and link to the flowchart since it is such a great tool. Admittedly, I haven't looked at it in detail in a good long while until today though, and noticed that it hasn't been updated since 2016. There are a few areas that I feel like could use updating or discussion. Curious what the community thinks about these suggestions or if there are any other sections that they think could be changed in 2022.

1) I think paying the ""non-essential"" bills (like cable, internet, etc) should take priority over the emergency fund. Leaving them unpaid could lead to loss of service and being sent to collections, which will have long term credit score effects. If you cannot pay of these bills, then that should be handled in the ""create a budget"" step

2) HSA contributions is way too far back. Should be after employer matching and high interest debt.

3) I think that giving the ""snowball method"" of payment equal time to avalanche is inappropriate for this chart. We already know that since we passed the ""make minimum payments on all debts and loans"", that cash flow is not an ongoing problem.

4) I think that the ""moderate interest debt"" (Defined as 4-5% excluding mortgages) comes to early in the flow chart. It comes before basically any non-employer match retirement savings. Semi-related, but debt from 5-10% interest rate is not addressed in this flowchart

5) Maxing your IRA comes before saving 15% total for retirement. Kind of nitpicky, but depending on employer match, etc, its possible for many people to hit that 15% before maxing their IRAs.

6) For the ""retire early"" end goal, there needs to be something about having brokerage accounts to access before retirement age

CryptoCurrency,Prices Will Get Even LOWER,"I will try my best to summarize everything in a few paragraphs as this is very complex and is quite a lot. I also previously made posts about this topic and you can check previous posts for further info. Most of the sources are also included. Other sources are on previous posts.

As a general reiteration, virtually all countries around the world are struggling to fight inflation as well as being hit hard by the effects of climate change. There is high single to double-digit inflation in almost every country you look at. There are massive floods, droughts and high temperatures that are crushing economies, by drying up some of the most key waterways in the world such as the Rhine in Germany, the Yangtze in China, the Danube in Western Europe and the Colarado River in the US. Entire sections of these rivers have dried up that are causing companies to decrease or outright halt operations.

Russia has stopped pipeline flows of natural gas to Europe, having provided 40% of Europe's energy pre-war. They say flows will not resume until Europe lifts sanctions meaning that they have lost almost half of their energy from a cheap and convenient energy source. Neither of the sides are likely to bend to the either, meaning that Europe is about to face winter while having their main source of heating and energy cut off. It is to the point that classrooms in Normandy, France have begun arrangements to heat their classroom with *wood.* French companies have to submit plans to reduce their energy usage by 10%. German energy bills are set to increase by around 500 euros a year while Germany is expected to lose 225 billion over the next two years if gas flows stay halted. OFGEM, the UK energy regulator, has already increased energy price caps by 80%, with room for further raises if necessary as UK energy bills a projected to cost twice the monthly wage in 2023. Similar stories continue across Europe. EU states have agreed to cut energy usage by 15%, a measure that will suffocate the economies across Europe.

China, **the worlds largest exporter,** is going through a Lehman Crisis moment as youth employment is almost 20%. There was a theft of 6 billion from customers through the banking system and there are now widespread protests and customers are refusing to pay mortgages and effectively defaulting as real estate companies are themselves heavily overleveraged and out of cash. Two real estate companies have begun what is expected to be a wave of defaults. Meanwhile, China continues its mass lockdowns at any hint of COVID. There have now recently been arrests of dozens of individuals related to the banking theft. There are now reports of banks restricting withdrawals to only a few hundred yuan(few dozens USD). In the crypto space, we all know what withdrawal restrictions mean.

A recent industry-wide issue has now just occurred that European energy companies face 1.5 **trillion** euros(same amount in USD) in margin calls. How this occurs is that companies generally hedge their business operations in case of some systemic risk like floods for an agricultural company. This means that even if there are floods you have bought some sort of insurance so you don't lose everything if your business is heavily affected. Basically, all your eggs are not in one basket. However, since Russia has cut off gas flows the companies that provide this insurance have in effect raised the premium and energy companies have to pay more for the insurance. In a time of massive inflation and high rates by banks these energy companies have to find even more funds. And as usual, all these costs get passed right back onto the consumer, the little guy. So the already terrible energy bills are going to go even higher. This can be mitigated if the governments decide to spend millions to subsidise citizens, but then we know that game. All the money governments spend to help citizens come right back to bite them through inflation, at a time of *already* super high inflation rates. There is no way out of this.

All of this meanwhile countries continue to struggle to feed themselves as grains, that account for 45% of the world's diet, and around 25% of which comes from Russia and Ukraine. Food supplies are further reduced by the aforementioned climate and environmental issues where temperatures are either too high or too low as well as the effects of drought causing crop failures. This is sure to affect developing countries.

Another factor for developing countries is a lack of foreign exchange. Fed is continuing interest rate increases and the dollar is still skyrocketing in value and so further reducing supply. Developing economies need forex to survive which is precisely why they are called developing. The manufacturing and production are weak and most economies work by simply buying goods from foreign markets and selling them locally. But forex is needed to buy the foreign goods initially, forex that is very low in supply.

The US has already shown weakness and signs of recession from asset prices, to lay-offs to the unemployment rate and the rise of multiple job-holders and continued Federal Reserve rate increases, massively increasing consumer debt levels and loan default by prime borrowers. I dove into these already on previous posts. I called the crash from around \~$25,000 in these earlier posts as well.

Open interest in top tokens has also surged in anticipation of the merge. Exchanges are seeing record short interest in top tokens.

I am not calling anybody out. I am not insulting anybody. I am just saying that while yes markets might be a casino, at this point this ain't a game anymore. At this point, if you know you can't afford to lose what you have in, take out what you must from the market. Where we are right now, things look bad and have much room to get worse. If you are into shorting tokens you may have a good time, but otherwise, the signs look downright catastrophic.

personalfinance,Buy $15k used car in cash or get loan?,"So my high mileage, early 2000s car recently broke down and the cost to repair it is nearly as much as the car is worth. Long story short, my wife and I are in the market for a new used car.

We're looking at used cars in the \~$15k range (incl. taxes, title and registration). Right now we have close to $12k in emergency savings, plus an additional $10k in a high yield savings account for a total of $22k. We also have a decent nest egg built up from maxing out our 401ks and Roth IRAs over the last handful of years but obviously don't want to touch those unless absolutely necessary. We make a combined $110k annually with relatively stable jobs and live in a LCOL area.

I'm not sure if it would be best to just to pay for the car with cash, or put a good chunk of money down and take out a small loan. Our credit scores are excellent, but from what I've seen, we'd still be looking at 7-9% interest rates on a used car loan. We typically have $1,500 - $2,000 extra each month (after 401k contributions) that we can put towards savings, investments or our emergency fund so it would only take a few months to get our emergency fund back to our $12k minimum. I could also lower my 401k contribution from \~$1,600 monthly to $315 for the next few months to get an extra $1k each month to put towards our emergency fund. As long as neither of us lose our job or face significant unexpected expenses, it wouldn't take more than 2 months. 

Option 1: Buy $15k car outright with cash, then save $5k as quickly as possible to replenish emergency fund

Option 2: Put $10k down on car, take out $5k loan, and pay back loan as quickly as possible.

personalfinance,Help trying to dispute $1300 medical debt that has gone to debt collectors.,"Hi,

I was wondering if my partner has a way out of paying his medical bill of $1300. It recently went to a debt collection agency and we're not sure how to get rid of it or dispute it. We're in California. 

He got this debt after going to a new PCP after getting new insurance from his new job. He selected the doctor through his job's portal and it seemed that he was in network with his EOP insurance. He saw the doctor about a week after selecting him and had his annual physical done. He saw him again for a follow up. I think a few days before seeing him again, he got a bill saying he owned a bunch of money. I though it was probably his insurance making a mistake because he saw his doctor quickly after setting up his insurance. The same happened to me and then the amount was cleared up. 

Sadly, this was not the same case for him. After we called his insurance, they said the doctor was out of network and they wouldn't cover anything. I'm not sure how the doctor's clinic didn't tell us this before we went to the appointments since they always check your insurance to make sure it's accepted. His insurance said they might forgive it and pay it because it was a mistake. They ended up not though. I thought maybe it would be best to not pay the bill at all. But now it seems the bill has gone to a debt collector. We started received three letters with different amounts due and even saying they charge interest. I called the hospital to confirm and they said they had sent the bill to them. But because it is something recent, they might let us still pay the hospital back instead. 

I've been digging around for ways to help our situation and I came across some new CA bill that was signed in 2021 that says medical bills can't be sent to debt collectors before 180 days. Today is day 175 since he first say his doctor. Not sure if this is something important though.

My partner called the debt collectors today and asked to lower the bill to $900. They said they can only lower it by 20% and that they'd put in a request. He then said he could do payments instead...not sure if he goofed here...after saying that the lady rushed him, said he'd get a text message with details, and hanged up. He called again and some new person said they'd send him a confirmation text. 

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!",finance,1662655348

Cosidering that there will be extra costs im not seeing plus the house could end up being valued slightly higher, in my head im counting on having to spend around 25k total. All the money I have saved up right now is 40k, so that would leave me with about 15k or so in my bank account.

Can someone explain this document I received entitled, ""Statement Concerning Your Employment in a Job Not Covered by Social Security""","Hey guys, sorry if this is a dumb question, I recieved this form, and I was wondering if anyone could shed a light on exactly what it means and what kind of implications it has for my future? 

""Your earnings from this job are not covered under Social Security. When you retire, or if you become disabled,
you may receive a pension based on earnings from this job. If you do, and you are also entitled to a benefit
from Social Security based on either your own work or the work of your husband or wife, or former husband or
wife, your pension may affect the amount of the Social Security benefit you receive. Your Medicare benefits,
however, will not be affected. Under the Social Security law, there are two ways your Social Security benefit
amount may be affected.


Windfall Elimination Provision

Under the Windfall Elimination Provision, your Social Security retirement or disability benefit is figured using a
modified formula when you are also entitled to a pension from a job where you did not pay Social Security tax.
As a result, you will receive a lower Social Security benefit than if you were not entitled to a pension from this
job. For example, if you are age 62 in 2013, the maximum monthly reduction in your Social Security benefit as
a result of this provision is $395.50. This amount is updated annually. This provision reduces, but does not
totally eliminate, your Social Security benefit. For additional information, please refer to Social Security
Publication, “Windfall Elimination Provision.”


Government Pension Offset Provision


Under the Government Pension Offset Provision, any Social Security spouse or widow(er) benefit to which you
become entitled will be offset if you also receive a Federal, State or local government pension based on work
where you did not pay Social Security tax. The offset reduces the amount of your Social Security spouse or
widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the amount of your pension.


For example, if you get a monthly pension of $600 based on earnings that are not covered under Social
Security, two-thirds of that amount, $400, is used to offset your Social Security spouse or widow(er) benefit. If
you are eligible for a $500 widow(er) benefit, you will receive $100 per month from Social Security ($500 -
$400=$100). Even if your pension is high enough to totally offset your spouse or widow(er) Social Security
benefit, you are still eligible for Medicare at age 65. For additional information, please refer to Social Security
Publication, “Government Pension Offset.”

Social Security publications and additional information, including information about exceptions to each
provision, are available at www.socialsecurity.gov. You may also call toll free 1-800-772-1213, or for the deaf

CryptoCurrency,Is doomsday coming for many alts? The SEC will likely rule almost every alt as a security,"Anyone who has been in this space for a while knows of the difficult relationship between crypto and the SEC, which stands for the Securities and Exchange Comission. The SEC is an independent government body government regulatory agency responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair and orderly functioning of the securities markets, and facilitating capital formation. For clarity, a security is ""a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that represents some type of financial value, usually in the form of a stock, bond, or option.""

A lot of the discussion has been concerned with which crypto tokens are securities and which are not, because the SEC is the federal regulator of the securities market. Quite some time ago, the SEC claimed that XRP is a security on 22 December 2020. That case is still ongoing and the SEC has been delaying it heavily. What happened to XRP? Well, after it was deemed a security, it went about -70% within a week and never really recovered (back then it was #3 in market cap):

There have been other instances of the SEC highlighting projects as securities. Recently, for instance, the SEC said that 9 projects were securities, namely: AMP, RLY, DDX, XYO, RGT, LCX, POWR, DFX and KROM. These tokens have not done very well relative to the rest of the market (e.g. AMP is bleeding out).

Now, it is entirely unclear what the SEC views as a security in the crypto space, because clear guidelines are missing. However, they are creating these guidelines, and the SEC will ""soon"" rule which token is a security and which is not. Gary Gensler said: ""that the CFTC will regulate spot + futures for non-security tokens, and the SEC will regulate spot + issuance of tokens that are securities"". This is consistent with the incoming bill of several senators. What does this mean? Sam Bankman-Fried from FTX writes:

https://preview.redd.it/0xydsff5pom91.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b036ffa4b69a51a0ac1f09773407c33a14982d21

So BTC and its forks (e.g. Bitcoin Cash) and ETH and its forks are likely safe. But many other coins are on the chopping block. Many tokens will likely be ruled as securities and it is possible that this could have the same effect as it did on XRP, in essence shifting money away from those projects ruled as securities to those projects ruled as not being securities.

What do *you* expect to be ruled as a security and what not? How big wil the effect be on this space?",cryptocurrency,1662665062

May not be a great road ahead for Bitcoin.,"Every part of this world is struggling right now with the climate change and governments will need to take very drastic steps soon. They do when they have to (especially when electoral chances are at risk) - a good proof is Fed rate hikes in US - it’s still going strong and beyond anyone ever expected.

This could be a horrible situation for Bitcoin but a massive opportunity for Ethereum with its upcoming PoS migration. If Governments do take drastic actions and ERGs get more strict, we may witness an Ethereum Bitcoin flip and ETH becoming the most valued chain. Of course, other blockchains on PoS consensus will do well especially - Solana.

This may not be a bad thing. If Bitcoin is not good for environment, the foundation needs to do something about it. So glad ETH is just on time for the PoS migration.

Student Loans - $55.5K /  6.125% Interest Rate when loans accumulate interest again in 2023 (I did receive pell grants so principal may be $35.5k if student loan relief goes through)

Truck loan - $6,730 principal / 4.59% Simple Interest Rate - about $250 per month which will not be paid off until 2/7/25

I am currently making about 4k-4.3k net monthly (important to note that I make 1k net per month from a part-time job that I plan to leave in Nov or Dec this year).

Is it a smart move to try to refinance now trying to get a lower interest rate? Credit score is around 750-760 range. The only reason I would want to refinance is if I would end up saving on interest overall. Not super concerned with lowering monthly payments although that would be nice too.

stocks,QT 2018 vs QT 2022,"First post here so please go easy on me. I wanted to start a discussion comparing the two Fed tightening cycles listed in the post title. 

Equity markets sold off in late 2018 while the first attempt of QT was in full effect from 2016 until about September 2019 along side a hiking cycle that looks to have ended June 2019 and then rate cuts commenced. The markets rallied from a bottom of December 2018 until Feb 2020. 

It is now 2022 and we are in the middle of a Fed hiking cycle soon approaching a restrictive Fed funds rate and the highest amount of monthly QT just started from the Fed balance sheet all to fight high inflation.

What were the main catalysts that fueled the sell off in 2018? Was it more related with the tariffs or was it tighter fiscal monetary policy weighing in on the markets? What exactly made the Fed pause QT and what made them cut rates?

Between rate increases and balance sheet runoffs, is one or the other more effective to combat the current levels of inflation?

Or is this just an apples to oranges comparison of tightening cycles to fight historic levels of inflation vs the Fed’s 1st attempt to unload assets from the balance sheet? I apologize if these questions have previously been posted. Thank you for your time.",finance,1662676232

For context, the area we are looking in is suburban with good schools, so the houses sell quickly and the offers are quite competitive. There's been a lot of disappointments when someone beat us out with a cash offer. Anyway, we finally got an offer accepted on a home we really fell in love with, and while the housing market seems to be back on a more realistic trajectory, the past year or so has made us a bit anxious about closing the deal.

Here is the relevant financial information:

Combined monthly income : $6,500 (net after taxes/insurance/retirement contributions)

Liquid Assets: $100,000

Additional Assets: $55,000 in a brokerage account, $50,000 in my 401k, $35,000 in her 401k and our current home, which is fully paid off, ready to go on the market and worth $150,000.

Debt: No mortgage, no credit card debt. My car is fully paid off, wife has a monthly car payment of $319. She also has $20,000 of federal student loans remaining, but is in a grant program that will have this fully paid off by 2024.

New House Cost: $340,000. We are putting 20% down and getting a mortgage for the remainder (pre-approved at the moment). The house is in fantastic shape with a lot of recent upgrades/improvements, including a roof, hot water tank, furnace and hardwood flooring. The monthly mortgage, including property taxes and homeowner's insurance, should be around $2,000.

Are we on solid footing here? I've looked at it from multiple angles and I don't see much vulnerability, except maybe tightening our belts a bit if our current home takes a long time to sell.

personalfinance,New Graduate - New Job - Current Budget listed,"Hi!

New graduate here found a job in my field. Job is a non-profit job that pays a little over 50k a year. Not much, but the role and company has amazing benefits. 22m. Currently having no CC debt, have a fully paid for car (no major problems aside from bad sensors), paid off the registration for this year + smog, Costco member, 1k emergency fund, and another 1k in an ETF (VTI). I have about 4.1k in federal student loans and I 100% qualify for the forgiveness if it does go through (Family was low income and I was a pell grant recipient). Quite healthy but can obviously get better eating, sleeping, and exercising habits. I also live with my partner and we split everything more or less. 

My healthcare is paid for, Hybrid position, generous gas reimbursement, 5% 403b match, Dental, vision, etc.


With that in mind, here is my planned budget. 

**Rent**: 1075

**Internet**: 25

**Savings/Emergency fund**: 500

**403b**: 500

**Utilities**: 100~150** (Gas +Electricity) (We only have a wall AC and a Portable AC)

**Gym**: 91 (Rock Climbing)

**Car insurance**: 50

**Gas**: 150

**Subs**: 22

**Groceries**:200**

** = Split with partner

So, I take home about **$3220** a month after taxes (Based off my first paycheck, get paid bi-weekly). That leaves me around a little over **450$** left after bills and savings above. I don't pay for my phone since I'm in a family plan with my parents. My car insurance is cheap since I'm also in a family plan. Also, for utilities, it really is a guesstimate since we haven't received our first bill and I'm accounting for total amount so that number would be split. Food is the same thing and if anything, it will stretch to 300 if we want to buy expensive meats but 200 is good for now. My gas is fully reimbursed and I get a lot of extra money back (depends on the month since I have to visit clients). Example: Last month, I drove ~**200 miles**. My car gets about **25mpg** so gas is about 5$ (California) they would reimburse me about **40$**. They gave me **$130**. Again, it varies how much per month depending on the amount of driving I do per month. Anyhow, I started work at August so I'm aggressively trying to get the 5% match thus the reason why I'm putting 500$ a month on my 403b (Couldn't put money in my 403b for the month of August since benefits started September). I'll be 500$ under to reach my match goal on December but I'm hoping that the extra gas money would allow me to reach the goal. The remaining money I have will be used for either furniture (we have all the essentials like a bed, desk, etc), entertainment, eating out, side savings account bucket (ally), and anything else really.

gaming,Happy Game (2021) Interpretation,"I just finished playing Happy Game by Amanita Design and I was blown away by the art and just the overall feel of the game. I've seen a lot of different interpretations and I thought that I would put my thoughts on the game here. Since the game is composed of three different nightmare sequences, I'll go through each one and explain my thoughts on them. I see this game as being entirely about the loss of childhood early on in life. None of this has been confirmed by the creators so I'm just working off my thoughts on the game.

Nightmare 1 - Toys: I see this part as expressing the effects of bullying on small children. In this portion, we follow the main character as he's chasing after a ball, which is shown being taken from him by an older boy in a flashback sequence. It's clear from this that our protagonist had been bullied in school, with other children taking his toys away from him. In my interpretation, this is why the first nightmare of the game is focused on taking these innocent children's toys and making them horrifying. The protagonist used to see his toys as a source of comfort, but due to the bullying, he was no longer able to see them the same way. He wants to maintain his childhood joy and comfort but is afraid that if he does he will be bullied. Along with this is a lot of overstimulating scenes, especially the beginning puzzle that results in extremely loud music that makes our protagonist very scared. Perhaps he had very bad anxiety as a child and didn't know how to deal with it, leading to his mind creating these false scenarios to scare him out of doing what he enjoyed.

Nightmare 2- Rabbits, Hearts, and Smiles: This is one of the most important chapters, in my opinion, so each part will be discussed separately. This section of the game begins with another flashback sequence. This time, the protagonist almost falls into a lake, dropping his stuffed bunny into the water in the process. After this, he wakes up on a bed on a spherical map covered in flowers and colorful rabbits. Floating above the map is a bell that cries when rung, opening a hole in the ground where a giant rabbit comes out and begins chasing the player. After escaping said rabbit, we find ourselves in a similar situation, having to feed the rabbits carrots this time to get the larger rabbit to eat them. I honestly see this first part as a representation of the protagonist himself. He sees himself as small and weak, like a rabbit, but is also incredibly smart and quick thinking. Although he doesn't know where he is, he is still optimistic and does whatever he can with what he has around him. After these puzzles, we move on to a similar area full of a bunch of different hearts that we have to set up to make their heads explode. Each heart is having a good time until one small thing happens that will set them off and make them explode. However, the other hearts laugh when they see another's head explode and continue living happily. After setting up guillotines, you must cut apart another large rabbit, this one full of many bodies of the protagonist. Each part of the rabbit follows after you until it reaches its final hand and you are able to jump into the open hole. This I think represents the neglect that our protagonist faced from his loved ones without him realizing it. Despite all of the terrible things that happen to the hearts, they still continue playing and having fun. I feel that this shows that our protagonist had faced many traumatic experiences but didn't realize they were bad because they were from his loved ones. He doesn't understand what's happening to him until he has to face the rabbit. The rabbit that is full of his many bodies is the harsh truth that he's too afraid to face. He runs away because he doesn't understand how his past experiences have affected him. Finally, we have a long set of puzzles and sequences focused entirely on smiles. For a few of the puzzles, the protagonist has a smiley mask on that he cannot remove. I feel that this represents our protagonist being forced to internalize his feelings in front of other people. He is forced to put on a smile and pretend that everything is okay when really there's so much pushed down deep inside his heart. This to me is really cemented by an NPC you face early on. You find him past a pile of bodies with a large yellow head and a huge frown with a sign that has a crossed-out smiley face on it. Interacting with him causes him to rip your head off and toss you into the pile of bodies. In another puzzle, however, you get the front part of the mask broken off, showing your eyes. Interacting with him after this causes him to get frustrated, and unable to remove the protagonist's head. From here he begins chewing gum until it pops on his face and he starts crying. The protagonist then comforts the creature and the creature, in turn, removes the rest of the mask off the player. I see this as the protagonist coming to terms with his emotions and telling himself that it's okay for him to be upset. After this, you are forced into a hole with many smiley-faced monsters, having to blow up the hearts of each one, finally retrieving your stuffed bunny back at the end.

Nightmare 3- Despair and our dog: In the final part of the game, our dog runs away and we chase her throughout a monochromatic forest. This part I believe is the protagonist's fear of death or losing those closest to him. Throughout these final puzzles, we're faced with lots of skull imagery, loss of body parts, thunder, sacrifice, and other darker imagery. There's also a sequence where the world is flipped upside down, the dog underneath us and us on top. Along with this is the building of a cairn, which is a Scottish memorial tradition of building a pile of rocks, the higher the cairn, the more luck, and peace you'll have in your life. The protagonist realizes that death isn't something that he should be afraid of and he has to face it in order to become stronger himself. 

The Ending: The game ends with the protagonist waking up in his room to his peaceful room and the company of his dog. However, this glitches out and instead reveals our character lying on the floor in a dark room, surrounded by drawings, and smiling with his eyes closed. We see the large smile shown throughout the game as it zooms in, showing the protagonist fearfully banging on the glass, fogging it up, and drawing a smiley face. To me, the ending isn't really the happy ending that it says it is. The protagonist got everything he wanted, his ball, his bunny, and his dog. This however came at the cost of facing his own trauma and learning to be emotional. He didn't change after everything he saw and he continued living his false happy reality, ignoring all of the issues in his life. This is why he is trapped behind the smile at the end.

stocks,Question on VIX,"While I am not new at trading, I have a question for the swarm intelligence of reddit (the word intelligence used very hesitantly here):

The VIX routinely swings between 20 and 30 usd. I am almost inclined to think, that whenever the VIX hits 20 or below, it is an almost assured thing, to say that at some point in the next few months, volatility will pick up again and rise to around 30 (as it has historically).

Looking at the full-length historic chart, it has peaked above 30 at least 40 times since 2004, with the peaks becoming more frequent as time passes.

Looking at the macro-situation, I highly doubt volatility will decline anytime soon, no matter what fed / ECB policies are implemented, or what political factors change.

As such, I see the probability of the VIX swinging in this same range (if not higher) as time goes on as rather high, if not close to 100%.

So the investment idea would be to just buy whenever it drops below 20, and sell whenever it rises above 30.

Am I missing something here? Misinterpreting? Is this just too obvious to work?",finance,1662724170

#[Stock futures rise as Wall Street looks to snap a 3-week losing streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Friday following a choppy trading session as traders considered Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest comments on inflation.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 235 points, or 0.74%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.81% and 1.05%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Shares of DocuSign surged more than 17% in extended trading after the electronic agreements company reported an earnings beat. The company also issued a third-quarter revenue forecast that was above expectations.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 193 points, or 0.61%, during the regular session on Thursday — closing higher after alternating between gains and losses throughout the day. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.66%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.60%.
*****
&gt; Those gains put all three major averages on pace to snap a three-week losing streak. Through Thursday, the Dow is up 1.45%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.09%, and the Nasdaq Composite is 1.99% higher.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile recently as expectations of a 0.75 percentage point rate hike this month grew on Wall Street, after the Fed chair said again that he is “strongly committed” to bringing down inflation.
*****
&gt; “I think that people are grossly underestimating what the Fed is going to have to do to fight inflation,” Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said Thursday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “It’s incredibly ironic that investors are even considering a Fed pivot when the real fed funds rate remains about as most negative as it has historically been. So the Fed isn’t even really heartily fighting inflation yet. We don’t have a positive real fed funds rate. It’s hard to argue that we should turn wildly bullish anytime soon,” he added.

personalfinance,Withdraw IRA and/or apply for HELOC to help consolidate loans?,"My wife and I are attempting to consolidate our loans and credit card debt to help reduce some of the monthly payments to each that overall impacts what we pay back on our credit card - feeding into the cycle of building more debt..

Between car loans, a loan against our 401k's and our credit card, we are hovering around 55K owed.

I have an IRA with $35k in which I have not contributed for about 5 years, never had any sort of matching or other programs with my previous employer and considering withdrawing, knowing about 30% will go to taxes and penalties, but would be enough to pay off several loans. Why am I considering pulling the IRA? Generally speaking, some number crunching tells me the one time loss may not be as far off as the interest we'd be paying in the long run on the existing loans and card debt in addition to not opening a new line of credit to be worrying about monthly payments.

My goal would be to first pay off our 401k loans with our current employer as they are the highest payments each month we have and I rather use that towards paying towards the credit card debt. The only benefit, as we saw it was the 401k loan payback ""interest"" would all go directly back into 401k but the thought of switching or losing jobs would require immediate payback.

The other option, or an option to do in conjunction with the IRA, is to apply for a HELOC and consolidate the (remaining) loans or card debt to help reign in the monthly payments...

We had a good handle on our expenses prior to the pandemic, but I had changed jobs, needed several surgeries and move all within the past 2 years - on top of several needed home repairs. So we have a game plan going forward, it's just deciding the starting point.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 38 years old. Income a month is roughly $4,200 with nearly $4,000 going towards mortgage, bills and loans - does not include payments towards credit card.

Edit 2: I brought my 'financial plan' to an advisor, which was several spreadsheets that crunched all our monthly costs, average expenses, the different interest rates and me creating five approaches on how I would be approaching the budgeting.. Initially, the advisor did not like to hear of taking out of the IRA as usually a bad idea. Also suggested at first to pay the credit card with the higher interest rate. Where we did end up landing was how my plan was to eliminate three loans with the IRA post penalties, how that frees up cash flow for what I am paying into the loans each month to redirect to the credit card and how with current spending, we would be able to pay 0 out the card and start being more in the positive within 10 months.

The last time we took any sort of loan, it greatly tied up cash to pay towards the loan and only caused the credit card to slowly get away from us. the IRA is separate from our current retirement plans and not being paid into as well as being 100% me paying into at prior job and looking at alternatives, this made the most sense at present. A HELOC with closing cost then interest rate put us near the same as just withdrawing IRA. I would much rather keep the HELOC as a later/when needed option as to not have a loan cover other loans..

To sum up the approach, we will be eliminating my 3 highest costing monthly loans. This will free up over an additional $1,200 a month. This will all go directly towards the credit card and we will leave our car loans in place being only a year out remaining on one and low interest and payments on both. By paying off the 401K loans, it will leave us with options should we ever need to borrow against or weigh the HELOC for future home repairs/projects but going to avoid any loans in the near future.

Unrelated but good timing; I was informed I am being promoted at work that comes with a pay raise.

Social: 6.2%
Medicare: 1.45%
Federal WH: 15.22%
Pennsylvania WH: 3.07%
Philadelphia: 3.79%
Pennsylvania SUI EE: 1.29%-9.93%

I'm no tax expert or anything, just a barista and I'm noticing that a shit ton of taxes are taken out from my paycheck. It hurts more cuz we get paid weekly so the net pay looks low 🥴 I guess I should mention that I work over minimum wage, if that changes anything?

So just from my own digging, it seems that they're taking more then they should be? I thought taxes were to be 25% of your check. But based on my math, my employer is taking 30% Again, my paycheck looks small because of these damn taxes + getting paid weekly. 

After doing some math, based on my most recent paycheck, all the percentages are higher than what I found on Google, except for the PA SUI EE. Personally, I find that kinda shady? If they're taking out more, do I also get more back next year when I file my taxes?

vet,can't find vet available to help cat with teeth problems,"A couple weeks ago, my cat was having severe tooth pain (chattering teeth, hiding under the couch) and I couldn't find anyone willing to take her that day so I waited a few hours until the emergency clinic was open and then took her there. They prescribed some antibiotics and medicine and told me to find a vet to do oral surgery on her if she wasn't better after finishing the antibiotics. 

So I gave her her medicine for the full week as prescribed (and am still giving her the med that they said to give her every day for a month, as prescribed) and she was mostly better but still clearly not 100% cured, so I called every vet in a 20 mile radius and the soonest appointment I could get was almost 2 weeks away (it is this upcoming Wednesday). They said that during that appointment, they'd check out the issue and see if she needed surgery/if she was fit for surgery (she is 16 years old so it is a risk). I figured the problem was no longer urgent and we could wait until then. But then, several days passed and she started getting worse again, and today I noticed that one of her canines is now crooked. She is not hiding under the couch or chattering her teeth like she was that first night, but she struggles to eat even soft cat food despite having an appetite.

Should I take her to the emergency vet again? Is there even anything they can do for her? I would assume an emergency place isn't exactly equipped to handle surgeries like that (especially with how understaffed the place is) but I don't really know how any of this works.

edit/update: her canine tooth (the one that was crooked) just fell out and she doesn't seem to be in as much pain and is eating and enjoying both soft and hard cat foods. I'm no longer panicking but still definitely am taking her to the vet on Wednesday as scheduled and am gonna keep a close eye on her til then. Does that sound like an okay plan or should I rush her to the emergency vet today cuz her tooth just fell out? I'm not good at this sort of thing.",cryptocurrency,1662735033

The FBI [has recovered more than 300 classified documents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/02/fbi-inventory-mar-a-lago) from Mar-a-Lago this year, according to government court filings, after months of negotiations with advisers to former president Donald Trump, a subpoena and a court-approved search. Some of the seized documents detail top-secret U.S. operations so closely guarded that many senior national security officials are kept in the dark about them. One included details of a foreign government’s military defenses, [including its nuclear capabilities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/06/trump-nuclear-documents).

The documents were found mixed with thousands of unclassified items at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida residence and private club, more than a year after he left the White House. They could be used as evidence in the government’s ongoing investigation into possible mishandling of classified information, as well as possible hiding, tampering or destruction of government records. A federal judge has agreed to a request from Trump to appoint an outside expert to examine the documents and determine whether any should be shielded from investigators because of attorney-client or executive privilege.

I have zero loans otherwise. Remaining fall tuition expenses are zero (i.e. the $20k loan would go straight to my bank account). Spring tuition expenses are around $27K. I do not qualify for Biden's loan forgiveness plan. I will begin making income in July 2023, and it will be about $70k. Current breakdown:

$27,000 for final semester of tuition 

$10,500 for eight more months of rent 

$12,000 for credit card spending (approximated from last 12 months of total spending)

$3,000 - 5,000 for additional travel/celebratory expenses (ex: I want to go to Japan for a couple weeks)

**$50,000 - $55,000 total** 

**Available Funds until July 2023:**

$40,000 in Vanguard 500 index fund (Admiral Fund) 

$9,000 in Vanguard Money Market Settlement Fund 

*$15,000 in checking account from a recent family death. Biggest question is what to do with this.*

$20,000 in Federal direct loans for Fall semester

$20,000 in Federal direct loans for Spring semester

1. I am not sure what to do with the $15k. If I did not have immediate tuition expenses, I would invest it in a mutual fund. 
2. I am not sure if I should accept $20k in loans, $40k in loans, or $0 in loans. I do not qualify for loan forgiveness. 
3. I am not sure if I should sell shares in the mutual fund (total value $40k) to pay tuition, or if I should use loans to pay tuition. 
4. My most valuable resource at this stage of my life is free time. This is the last time in the foreseeable future where I will have months (quite literally many months of free time) available for travel.

CryptoCurrency,USD spending power up 14% year to date,"Since the beginning of the year the value of USD is up 14% compared to the global currency market. This accounts for inflation and exchange rate between currencies. 

We often think of crypto as allowing people in developing nations with high inflation to protect their money against inflation. Crypto provides an opportunity for everyone to store their money in a different currency. If you lived in the UK, Switzerland, or the Euro zone you would have more capital if you were storing money in USD stablecoins. 

Now, currency arbitrage has been around for a long time. Crypto makes it a lot lower fee and accessIble for the average person. 

The fact that the spending power of USD has gone up 14% is not necessarily a good thing. It has been spurred by the US raising interest rates which then has caused other countries to strengthen their currency by raising their interest rates. This can then have domino effects that can slow the world’s economy.",cryptocurrency,1662738162

I was shipping a laptop from location to another, via Fedex. Package was insured. Fedex seems to have lost it and its been a week. They are refusing to mark it as lost and saying its in transit and they are trying to locate it. (Maybe because they don't wanna pay out the claim?)

Every day,they say to give them 1 more day to locate it and they 'promise to do their best to deliver it'.

personalfinance,New Job - Budget below,"Hi!

New graduate here found a job in my field. Job is a non-profit job that pays a little over 50k a year. Not much, but the role and company has amazing benefits. 22m. Currently having no CC debt, have a fully paid for car (no major problems aside from bad sensors), paid off the registration for this year + smog, Costco member, 1k emergency fund, and another 1k in an ETF (VTI). I have about 4.1k in federal student loans and I 100% qualify for the forgiveness if it does go through (Family was low income and I was a pell grant recipient). Quite healthy but can obviously get better eating, sleeping, and exercising habits. I also live with my partner and we split everything more or less.

My healthcare is paid for, Hybrid position, generous gas reimbursement, 5% 403b match, Dental, vision, etc.

With that in mind, here is my planned budget.

Rent: 1075

Internet: 25

Savings/Emergency fund: 500

403b: 500

Utilities: 100~150** (Gas +Electricity) (We only have a wall AC and a Portable AC)

**Gym**: 91 (Rock Climbing)

**Car insurance**: 50

**Gas**: 150

**Subs**: 22

**Groceries**:200**

** = Split with partner

So, I take home about $3220 a month after taxes (Based off my first paycheck, get paid bi-weekly). That leaves me around a little over 450$ left after bills and savings above. I don't pay for my phone since I'm in a family plan with my parents. My car insurance is cheap since I'm also in a family plan. Also, for utilities, it really is a guesstimate since we haven't received our first bill and I'm accounting for total amount so that number would be split. Food is the same thing and if anything, it will stretch to 300 if we want to buy expensive meats but 200 is good for now. My gas is fully reimbursed and I get a lot of extra money back (depends on the month since I have to visit clients). Example: Last month, I drove ~200 miles. My car gets about 25mpg so gas is about 5$ (California) they would reimburse me about 40$. They gave me $130. Again, it varies how much per month depending on the amount of driving I do per month. Anyhow, I started work at August so I'm aggressively trying to get the 5% match thus the reason why I'm putting 500$ a month on my 403b (Couldn't put money in my 403b for the month of August since benefits started September). I'll be 500$ under to reach my match goal on December but I'm hoping that the extra gas money would allow me to reach the goal.

I have several friends of mine who have asked me since the June lows ""what do I do"" and my response is 100% of the time ""dollar cost average for as long as possible"". One person has $28k sitting in a checking account with no investments. I told them to withdraw $1k every month and pour it into VOO or SPY until they are down to $5k in checking. We can all disagree on if it would be better for them to just stick $23k of checking into VOO or SPY right now... 

My other friend is already heavily invested. He is like most people down about 18% YTD and tells me my advice of the past years ""dollar cost averaging"" is not cutting it for him. I feel bad he is down 18% YTD, but so is almost everyone else. 

Tell me why, if it is, that DCA is wrong. I think it is the best way to invest, and call me evil in bad times like this year, but it just is the best possible route. Both of my friends made me feel small today because they are certain we are going to have a 20% dip thanks to some of the talking heads out there saying things like the soon to come rate hike will lower stocks. 

Tell me - is this time around different? Should we have all sold in winter when we began to see slippage in the S&amp;P 500?

68% VOO ($21,000) 

8% TSLA ($2,470) 

7% TQQQ ($2,100) 

The remaining 17% is in cash ($5,250) right now. Should I myself sell everything and wait for a dip? If I do this I will lose out on my dividends payments to come in many weeks for VOO...

&gt; # The Midterm Election Is Two Months Away. What Investors Need To Know

&gt; First things first, the Carson Investment Research team would like to send our condolences to the Queen’s family, and all of our friends in the UK. We lost a great one yesterday and the world is a better place because of her.

&gt; Midterm elections are right around the corner, as this week marked two months from the always important election. Although this year investors have been more worried about inflation, the war, the economy, and the stock market than the election, one thing that is playing out once again is midterm years tend to be volatile.

&gt; # The Calendar
&gt; As our first chart shows, the average midterm year since 1950 corrected 17.1% on average, the most out of the four-year presidential cycle. That’s the bad news, the good news is stocks gained 32.3% on average a year off those lows and have never been lower. Although we don’t know if June 16 is officially the lows or not, there could be a lot of opportunity for bulls over the coming year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Here’s another look at the same thing, but breaking it down by each year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Should we be surprised that stocks have had a tough go so far in 2022? Maybe not, as this next chart shows the worst time for stocks is a midterm year under a new President. With the S&amp;P 500 up only 2.4% on average these years, it helps put the disappointing year so far into perspective. Now check out what happens the following year, which might be something many investors could be smiling about soon enough.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Here’s one more look at how stocks do based on the calendar. Below we’ve broken returns down by each quarter out of a 4-year presidential cycle. Sure enough, the first three quarters of a midterm year are historically quite weak, some of the worst out of the entire cycle actually. Once again though, we are on the cusp of some of the strongest quarters coming up and investors need to take notice of the positive seasonality right around the corner.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-Midterm.png))**

&gt; # What About The Election?
&gt; Historically the party that loses the election is the motivated party and they tend to gain seats in the House and Senate. In fact, since World War I, the winning party lost nearly 30 seats on average at the first midterm election. FDR during the Great Depression and George W. Bush (post-9/11) are the only two instances when the President’s party gained seats in the House.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Please don’t shoot the messenger here, but President Biden’s approval ratings have been among the worst ever at this point of a new Presidency. In fact, his current Gallup approval rating of 42% extrapolates out to approximately a 40 seat loss in the House for the Democrats.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-6-Midterm.png))**

&gt; What does it mean for investors? Well, Republicans need to win only five seats to regain control of the House, which is quite likely at this point. The Senate is more of a coin toss, but history shows 4 seats have been added by the motivated party since World War II. With the Senate split 50/50 right now, this one is very close to call, but the Republicans could gain one seat and take full control of Congress. As the chart below shows, the very best scenario for stocks is a Democratic President and a Republican controlled Congress. Should the Democrats retain control of the Senate, that scenario of a Democratic President and split Congress is quite strong for stocks as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-7-Midterm.png))**

&gt; # Leave On Some Good News
&gt; Odds are investors will start to hear a lot more about the midterm elections over the coming weeks. You might hear that these sectors will do well if so and so wins, or that these sectors will do poorly if this happens. The truth is no one really knows. After President Trump won in 2016 it was widely assumed coal and steel would do great, the opposite happened. Then under President Biden green energy was to do great and dirty crude and coal would struggle, again, the opposite has happened. We aren’t saying you shouldn’t think like this, it just isn’t so clear cut.

&gt; What is clear cut is stocks historically have done quite well the year after the midterms. As you can see in our last chart, the S&amp;P 500 gained a year after the election every single time since World War II, with a very solid 14.1% average gain over that year. Why is this? Likely markets hate uncertainty and there is a lot of that leading up to a midterm election. But once the election is over the uncertainty is likely lifted.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-8-Midterm.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Midterm elections are very important for a lot of reasons, but the best part for investors is once the election is over, stocks tend to get a nice tailwind. On the Carson Investment Research team we think this could happen once again and is one reason why we remain overweight stocks here.

&gt; # Four Charts On The Worst Month Of The Year

&gt; “October: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.” Mark Twain

&gt; Although October is known for some spectacular crashes, it is September that historically has been the worst month of the year for stocks, suggesting Mr. Twain should maybe change his famous stock market quote. In fact, as our first of four charts show, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.5% on average in September, making it the worst month of the year. It’s also been the worst month over the past 10 and 20 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-090722.png))**

&gt; Why is it so weak you ask? The two ideas that make the most sense to me is first, the big boys are back from the Hamptons and begin to sell to square up their books. Secondly, many large hedge funds and institutions end their fiscal years in October and you tend to see some selling ahead of year-end. Of course, I’d like to ask why October isn’t weak if this is the case, but I digress. Whatever the exact reason, we just think it is important for investors to be aware of this potentially tricky month.

&gt; The next chart is something that most investors might not know. Most of the weakness historically takes place later in the month, while the first half is fairly strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-090722.png))**

&gt; Our next chart (or technically a table, but you know what I mean) is always a popular one, as it shows how each day of the year historically has done. This once again shows later in September is one of the worst times of the year. I’d like to note that my birthday is October 28, which until only recently had been the best day of the year. I’m not sure that’s a coincidence and I look forward to it taking back the number one spot soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-090722.png))**

&gt; Finally, this last chart shows that if stocks are weak heading into September, things can get even worse. As you can see, the average September drops 0.5% on average, but sports a slight gain if it starts the month above the longer-term 200-day moving average. The catch is things get worse when it starts beneath the 200-day moving average or down more than 15% year-to-date. Given 2022 started September down 17% year-to-date and beneath the 200-day moving average, the potential for seasonal weakness is quite high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-090722.png))**

&gt; The good news is we do think the lows for the year are likely in, but it won’t be a smooth ride and we’d advise investors to be ready for some bumps over the coming weeks. Please continue to read our blog, as the Carson Investment Team breaks it all down for you.

&gt; Since the S&amp;P index futures began trading on April 21, 1982, stock options, index options as well as index futures all expire at the same time four times each year—known as Triple Witching. Some call it Quadruple Witching or Quad Witch due to single-stock and ETF futures, their impact on the market has thus far been subdued.

&gt; Monday Before September Triple Witching is less bearish with DJIA and S&amp;P flat on average, but NASDAQ is down 14 of last 23 with and average loss of -0.25%. September’s option expiration week is up 57.5% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 52.5% of the time and 55.0% of the time respectively.

&gt; However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last nineteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times, but NASDAQ is down the last four. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down nine of the last ten since.

&gt; **S&amp;P 500 Down 25 of 32 Week After September Quarterly Options Expiration, Average Loss 0.89%**

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. The week after September quarterly options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 32 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are the sea-of-red in the tables here. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –0.98%, S&amp;P 500 –0.89%, NASDAQ –0.85%. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter.

&gt; # Historic Small Cap Volatility

&gt; It's no secret that growth stocks have underperformed value stocks over the last twelve months. The trailing-twelve-month performance spread (percentage points) between the small-cap growth and large-cap value indices, two opposite ends of the equity market, is currently at -20.5 percentage points. Although this is far above the recent low of -33.9 ppts, the current reading is in the bottom 6% of all days since the mid-1994 (when both the MSCI USA Small Cap Growth and MSCI USA Large Cap Value Index were active). Interestingly, this year's trailing twelve-month performance spread was the lowest since 2001 (unwind of the dot-com bubble). Funny enough, the spread had hit the highest level since early 2000 in 2021, as excessive performance from small-cap growth stocks has tended to reverse course after reaching extreme levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/TTM-Performance-Spread-ppts-090722.png))**

&gt; Small-cap growth stocks tend to trade at significantly higher valuation multiples than large-cap value stocks, which is part of the reason that small-cap growth equities have sold off at a higher rate than their counterparts. These stocks also have higher betas, so market moves have a disproportionate effect. These factors have caused the average daily percent change spread between the two indices to reach an extremely elevated level, the highest since 2000 - 2001. This measure of volatility is also yet to roll over, indicating no end to the volatility regime that has been in place.

CryptoCurrency,Is ‘The Merge’ bullish or bearish?,"'The Merge' narrative continues to bring interest and trading activity to crypto. In August, Ethereum accounted for 40% of all crypto trading volume. BTC had around 30%.

Ahead of 'The Merge' ETH derivative markets are implying bullish sentiment. The call/put ratio currently stands at 3.81.  
   
Meaning, there are more than 3 times the number of options to buy vs options to sell.  
   
The highest call option stands at a US$3,000 strike price.  
   
It’s NOT all bullish for 'The Merge'…  
   
Major ETH whales have moved 11% of their holdings from cold wallets onto centralized exchanges. Historically, this is a sign of a plan to sell.  
   
At this point does anyone know if ‘The Merge’ is bullish or bearish?

Boxer Bulldog - 1 year, 6 months old

My dog has had diarrhea for 5 days, pooping in his bed and me waking up to it at 4am.  He started acting lethargic so I withdrew his food for 12hrs and contacted vets.  I, then decided to feed him a chicken rice bowl, which he ate.. gave him some pepto and then got back to normal and full energy.  Poops were getting normal.  Fast fwd to about 10 hrs later, my grandmother brought him some boiled chicken w rice and we fed him again - he was unable to hold it down.  Fast fwd again bc I withdrew food for a few hours... I gave him some rice w a little bit of pumpkin, he held that down... so I tried to work in just a few pieces of dog food later in the day yesterday - he now has diarrhea again 😒 this food has never given him diarrhea before, he's had it for like 7 months.  I'm at a loss on what to do??  Other than diarrhea, he's completely normal and no longer vomiting.

personalfinance,(Mathematical) question on mortgages and mortgage terms,"tl;dr: If I get a 30-year mortgage and overpay every month to the same amount of a 25-year monthly mortgage payment, will I be in the exact same position in 5 years when I have to remortgage as if I got a 25-year mortgage in the first place?

In the UK, mortgages have an initial term of a few years where the interest rate is fixed, after which it goes variable. Most people remortgage after this fixed term to start a new fixed term mortgage.

I got an offer for a 30-year mortgage - let's say at £500,000 - for 3.5% interest fixed for 5 years (after which it goes variable). This means my monthly payments are £2,245 in this example.

I actually wanted a 25-year mortgage (monthly payments of £2,503) to minimise the total amount of interest I pay back over the years, but my broker made a mistake and got me a 30-year offer. This isn't an issue, as the broker can easily request it to be amended to 25 years before the house purchase.

In fact, I may want to keep it as is, and this is the source of the question. in the UK, most lenders (including the one from which I got an offer) allow you to overpay every year (by 10% of the remaining principal amount, which is well above what I need in this case). So may question is: should I just keep the 30-year mortgage, which gives me the *option* to pay less in a month if I ever need to, but aim to pay the 25-year equivalent monthly payments (£2,503 instead of £2,245, so overpay by £258 every month) for the next 5 years? Would this put me in the exact same position in 5 years when I remortgage, or would the total amount I still owe still be more than if I had taken a 25-year mortgage initially?

personalfinance,What stocks should I sell?,"Hello everyone!

I am here for some trading advice of you. My situation is as follows: 

I am about to buy a house. To get a bank loan with decent interest rates I need to bring in alot of my own money. That is why I want to sell atleast a quarter or even half of my stocks. My depot consists of several Etf's and maybe two dozen single stocks. Some of my stocks did really well (like 80% - 150% gains) and some of my stocks did poorly (like 5% - 30% losses). I try to buy only ""good"" companies, so the reason for most of my stocks that did poorly are because I bought them at a bad timing (like at the ATH right before the current bear market). So I expect most of them to eventually get back up in the long run. Admittedly some stocks are just high risk, for example hydrogen companies like Plug Power. I dont know if they will ever rise again to their previous ATH or die out. 

So as of right know I am unsure whether I should sell the stocks that are currently at a profit or the one that are currently at a loss.  At the one hand I dont wanna lock in my losses with stocks that I expect to get back up again. On the other side my profitable stocks will hopefully also keep rising and I dont want to keep only ""losing"" stocks in my depot. But I would potentially get more money by selling less stocks if I sell my gainers. However I have to pay taxes on my gains if I sell my profitable stocks. 

What do you guys think? Should I sell my winning or my losing positions or a mix of both to finance my future home?

Next Congressional Primary election: 11/8/2022.

Context: Internet search has a lot of articles about Trump.

Result: S&amp;P raised from 2,738.40 on 11/6/18 to 2,764.60 on 11/13/18 (increasing 0.10% in 6 trading days)

None of this is advice.  I ran a couple numbers and should have searched harder.

**Abstract**

The paper provides evidence for the existence of a midterm election effect on the US equity market. By examining the quarterly total returns on the S&amp;P 500 Index between 1954 and 2017, we show that, **nine times out of 10, the index has been positive in the fourth quarter of a midterm election year and the following two quarters.** This compounds to nearly 25% in those three quarters. Neither changes in the monetary nor the fiscal policies were able to explain the effect. Moreover, the authors show that the known third year of a presidential term effect is weaker than the examined midterm election effect. Our results are robust for selection time period.""",finance,1662807464

Also, to this point, I mean I’m willing to bet FAANG stocks rise on average by about $30-$40 per share by next year, so I could capitalize on those small gains. 

I could buy a couple of stocks but it doesn’t seem worth it. Idk. Is it worth it to have just like a handful of Apple or Amazon?

To grow that cash short term for money to move in a couple years or sooner. A large move across the country too. Which I’d probably just take me, muh dog, n muh cahr and sell the rest and arrive wherever cash-flush. I digress…

So let's say I'd exercise some ISOs in January 2023 and incur actual AMT - I would only have to pay it in the following tax season which would be March \~ April 2024? If not, then when? (I don't intend to exercise and sell the same year, so that I could have long capital gains tax in the future).

personalfinance,Advice for helping dad with rent/car payment?,"Hi! I just started my first post graduation job. I’m currently living with my dad and hoping to get advice on what would be fair for me to contribute financially. 
 

My salary is $85k in a relatively HCOL city in the south. I expect to take home around $5100 a month after taxes. Here’s what my monthly spending looks like:

Student Loans: $400 ($27k federal in my name, $12k parent plus in my dad’s name)
Internet: $100
Food/Restaurants: $400
Gas: $120 


Right now, I’m still on my dad’s health insurance, car insurance, and phone plan. My dad offered for me to stay on his health/car insurance, but I’m not yet sure if I should and give him money for it, or get my own plans. My phone is 5 years old and on its last legs, so I’ll be getting a new one soon. I also might start contributing to my company’s 401k ($0.50 every dollar up to 6%).
 

There’s two things I need to immediately help my dad out with, rent and my car payment. 
 

For rent, my dad’s monthly mortgage payment is $1600. I’m not sure what the grand total is with utilities. I’ve been here for a few weeks, living in one bedroom and using another room as an office. This is more of a relationship decision, but what might be fair for me to give him monthly? 
 

My dad purchased a car for me when I was in high school. It’s a 2015 4Runner with 90k miles. It’s fully loaded and the KBB value is $25-27k. I plan to drive it until the wheels fall off. My dad owes $7k on it. He drives an older vehicle and wants to get a new one soon. We’ve been talking about me either paying it off completely or taking out a loan. I’d like to pay it off over the next few months and be done, but my dad seems like he wants additional money on top of what is owed. What do you think would be fair for me to give him? Should I (1) pay it off + slowly give him more on top overtime or (2) just take out a loan and add more than what is owed now?
 

My dad and I argue everyday about money. I need to figure out how I’m going to contribute soon and let him know so that hopefully life can get a little better. I work 60 hours per week and I want to help my dad, but I also want to be sure I’m making smart financial decisions. I’d really appreciate any advice, thank you in advance!",finance,1662830844
personalfinance,Car Loan Anxiety - Don’t Want to Regret Purchase,"This is my first time financing and I’m very scared to go ahead with it. I make somewhere in the ballpark of $35k/yr and have decent but relatively new credit. The cars I’m deciding between have good reliability ratings, are CPO, 4-6 years old and $15-18k out-the-door. I can comfortably budget $200/month for car payments aside from insurance/gas costs. I’m not counting on getting a great interest rate with my lack of credit history, so assuming I can put any % down, is there any way I can do this that would make it a reasonable financial decision?

Edit: Thank you so much for all of the advice. Please believe me when I say I’ve been spending every waking moment that I’m not at work on Craigslist, Facebook, Autotrader, AutoTempest, CarGurus, TrueCar, etc. for months looking for something I can afford in cash.

personalfinance,"First job, how do I save appropriately?","Hi all! I’m in my mid 20s and just started my first real job. It’s been about 4 months but I quickly realized I need to A. Manage my money better and B. Start saving and investing because dang does money just disappear when you’ve got real responsibilities lol. Anyways, I’ve got my masters and unfortunately  have around 60k in grad school debt. Grandparents were super generous and are paying off my private loans (35k) so I can save myself from a 7% interest rate. They said I don’t have to pay them back but I’d like to eventually or at least pay for other things for them as they enter their retirement years. The other 35 is federal loans, if I get that 10k waived off then it’s 25k. I went to grad school right during the pandemic so my first year loans accrued only a couple months of interest before interest became 0. Also as of now I hadn’t been making payments towards the federal loans, only the private loans.
In terms of budget, I bring home a little under 4k a month after paycheck deductions like HSA, 401K insurance and taxes. My rent + utilities is about $1500. I’d say currently on average I’d spend about $2k a month (maybe even 2,300) if I include rent, groceries and eating out. Door dash has been the bane of my existence and I spend so much money on take out or buying lunch at work. Don’t worry, I’ve been on top of it and have started cooking at home and taking lunch so that money I’ve spent has significantly dropped. I do budget some fun money for going out (I’m in a new city and have been trying to make friends but I don’t go out super often). The majority of my monthly expenses beyond food has been new apartment things (living in new city and alone for the first time so needed furniture, tv or kitchen supplies etc. I tried to space out buying what I need but I now have what I need so I can expect my monthly expenses to drop a little).

Coming to the crux of my issue, all the rest of my money just sits in my checking account. I have been looking at getting a high interest savings account (maybe ally? Still have to do research).  But I guess my question is how much, and for what do I need to be saving a month. In my bank account I have about 16k. So I have at least 6 months worth of emergency fund. What about the rest of the money? I’d like to eventually have the following : save for a house, some emergency funds for car maintenance purposes, travel (vacation, travel to fly home to family or travel for weddings etc), some fun money ( like a new laptop or other big purchase things I would like), future wedding (?), retirement (have a 401k but do I need to invest more? Elsewhere?), also want to save some money to put into investments ( still need to research but I’d like to save a decent sum and once I figure out how I’d like to invest, I would do so ). So essentially, how much of a goal do I put on these things. Like should I save certain percentages of my paycheck towards each goal? Additionally, are there other things I haven’t thought off I should save towards?

personalfinance,Car purchases during divorce?,"I am going through a divorce, and  in my state, I am required to pay alimony and support my soon to be ex while splitting marital assets 50/50. 

Her VW SUV lease expires in 2 weeks. I have option to buyout the lease for less than car is worth. [19k residual vs. ~24k market value.] 

My Tesla lease expires end of the month. I can’t purchase it, but I can extend lease month-to-month for up to 6 months. [$400/mo]

On the 15th, I get my annual cash bonus… after taxes, it will be about $50k.  

Some options:  

A. I buy her car outright in cash, thereby removing need to make ongoing payments for her moving forward. I then extend my lease for a while, even though I will eventually need a bigger car as a single parent. (This seems like cleanest break.) 

B. I finance the buyout of her car, and finance purchase of my own new car. (This preserves maximum of the bonus, giving me liquidity in a time of uncertainty.)

C. I buy her car outright, and then make a big down payment on an SUV for myself. This reduces my payments moving forward, while preserving some immediate liquidity. (This is kind of like the middle path, I guess?) 

D. Some other variation I haven’t considered.

investing,What's The Deal With I Bonds? An Explanation,"I made a video explaining why I think I Bonds are a great investment. I don't want to post it here because I don't want to violate the self-promotion rule, but the mods suggested that instead of linking to it, I could post all the information from the video here for discussion. Therefore, please enjoy the script and feel free to ask questions below.

**What’s The Deal With I Bonds?**

Before we begin, I want to say up front: I’m not a financial advisor. I’m going to be giving an opinion about I Bonds, but nothing here should be construed as investment advice for you specifically.

I remember a few years ago my aunt passed away, and I learned she had left me some US Savings Bonds that she bought in my name the year I was born. These were physical paper bonds, and I felt sort of sentimental when I went to cash them in, thinking of what a nice thing she had done for me, so very long ago. But, if I’m honest - while I was touched by the gesture that type of savings bond wasn’t a great investment, because the face value wasn’t much more than when she bought the bond when I was born in…let’s see…carry the two…1853. And I think a lot of people feel that way about savings bonds. They’re old fashioned. They’re not going to make you rich, right? Why bother?

Well, there is a reason to bother, and it’s because of the Series I savings bonds. First issued in 1998, for a long time these were the best kept open secret in personal finance. These are, in my opinion, one of the best investments available to normal Americans. I’m going to explain why I Bonds are so great, I’ll discuss how you can get started in them, and I’m also going to talk about some of their drawbacks.

**IT’S ALL ABOUT INFLATION**

Why do we invest? Fundamentally it’s because if you’re not investing your money somehow, you’re losing it. Inflation means that money we stick in the bank loses value over time. If you had $100,000 in 1980, and you stuffed it into a mattress, and took it out today, it would only buy a fraction of what it would have bought in 1980. In fact, you would need around $360,000 2022 dollars to buy the same amount of stuff. Inflation is real, and it eats at your savings over time.

For the past few years, we’ve had very low inflation, but now that we seem to be entering another rough spot of higher inflation, people are starting to look for solutions. Enter I Bonds.

**THE GOOD**

I Bonds, or more properly “Series I Savings Bonds”, are a low-risk savings product of the United States Department of the Treasury. Unlike most savings bonds, which give you a fixed interest rate, usually less than you’d like, over their lifetime, the I Bond is a little more complicated. It consists of a fixed rate return, plus a variable rate. The variable rate is *indexed to* the inflation rate, specifically the nonseasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index. The interest on the bond is rolled into the principal every 6 months, so you effectively get compound interest on your I Bond. And you get it for approximately zero risk, because the bond is backed by the US Treasury.

For the past number of years, the fixed rate has been roughly 0%, so we can just treat I Bonds as a bond that is just indexed to inflation. If you had bought $10,000 worth of I Bonds in 1999, they would be worth $37,608 today - much better than if you’d left it in a savings account collecting desultory bank interest rates. You might have gotten that kind of return if you invested in the stock market…but to do that, you’d have to take more risk.

This isn’t where the story ends, though. There are other things that make the I Bonds special. The Treasury sells other inflation-protected securities, such as TIPS. But unlike TIPS, I Bonds are guaranteed to not lose value. Let me dig into that a little bit.

If you buy a TIPS bond, it’s indexed to inflation. So if inflation goes up, the value of your TIPS increases; but that’s also true if we experience *deflation* \- if inflation is below 0%, the value of your TIPS bonds will go down, limited to the face value you bought them at. This isn’t true of I Bonds - they are guaranteed to always maintain at least the value they held in the prior month. So if we experience inflation, your I Bond keeps pace with it, and if we experience deflation, your I Bond - by holding its current value - effectively becomes worth *more*. It’s like a product that has multiple types of insurance built into it. They’re an insanely good deal.

**THE BAD**

So are there any drawbacks to I bonds? There are, in my opinion, a few drawbacks, all of which are a very small price to pay. 

I Bonds are a good way to save, but they’re not going to make you rich. So while I think they fill a valuable role in many people’s portfolios, if you are looking for “I bought Xerox in 1936” or ""I bought Microsoft in 1990"" returns, they’re not going to get you there.

You can only buy them on the US Treasury’s “Treasury Direct” website. This is a very 2003 web site that is somewhat painful to use. Complaints about it are legion, and there’s just no sugarcoating it - it’s pretty bad. God help you if you accidentally lock yourself out of your account. \[whispered: ASK ME HOW I KNOW\]

Thirdly, I Bonds do lock up your money for a while. You can’t redeem them for a year after you buy them, and then you pay a small penalty if you redeem them within 5 years of purchasing them. This is a manageable risk for a product that’s meant for long-term savings, but is something to plan for.

Lastly, the Treasury itself is quite aware of how good of a deal they are giving … and so you’re limited to purchasing $10,000 of I Bonds per year. You can also get an additional $5,000 of I Bonds over and above that by applying your tax refund to it. They send you a paper bond - you can convert it into electronic form, but the process is, frankly, excruciating. I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether that’s something you want to do.

So if you, like so many of us, had looked at US Savings bonds and dismissed them as being not dynamic enough for your portfolio - take another look at I Bonds, and you might find there’s more to them than you thought.",finance,1662839783

solar,Experience with Project Solar?,"I received a few quotes for my solar project - SunRun, SunPower and Project Solar for an 7.2 kW system (11k kWh annually)

SunRun and SunPower quoted me 42k but Project Solar quoted me 22k. All include installation and price is before Federal Credit. 

The only caveat is SunRun and SunPower do help with adding an underlayment for the roof to support the panels. They are both quoting around 20k for that. Between the two, I'm convinced SunPower is a better option. Both of them are quoting a 2.5% interest rate for the entire project.

But project solar is too good to be true. I see two problems with Project Solar:

1. Project Solar did not have good reviews in this sub especially around installation. And given that I need some repair to the roof, I'm worried Project Solar will leave me to fend for myself if there are any problems. 

2. The account exec does not know if their installer would support the roof. She says that unless the engineering team takes a look they cannot tell me if they are going to support it. 

3. Project Solar is giving a 5% rate of interest. I don't know if I can shop around for financing the project like how I would for a car or a home. Are there banks that help with that?

Also Project Solars panels are not as good as SunPower's but better than SunRun. At half the price, it seems like a no brainer tradeoff to me. 

Browsing this sub, I read posts that 4$/kWhr seems expensive, but a few other local vendors are also quoting me the same price. I don't know where else to shop for cheaper quotes. 

I am confused at this point. Any pointers on how to decide here? I'm in San Jose, California if that matters. Any personal experience would be really helpful.",energy,1662850066
personalfinance,Should I apply for a credit card or personal loan for moving expenses?,"Hi! I'm trying to move to a new place in October. Unfortunately, I only have soft numbers to budget with right now. My rental and power company deposits will be somewhere between roughly $1100 and $850. With installments, the high end is $291 for three months and $225 for one month. At the low end, it's $174 for the first three months and $108 for next three months. I expect most or all of the deposit at my current place will transfer to the new rental deposit (same company), so it should be closer to an $850 total than $1100. I may also need to hire a moving company and will have to buy some things for the new apartment.

My only income is SSDI ($866/month) so even with installment plans, paying those deposits would be a significant burden. I mostly need help getting through the first few months and then I can funnel the excess money from the EBT increase and SSA cost of living adjustment in January towards the deposits. The electricity deposit ($200) is returned with interest after one year of on-time payments.

My credit score is in the 760s today. I have no debt, just a credit card that I pay off monthly. I do not want to carry a balance on it. I'm leaning towards applying for a card with a 15 month or longer 0% APR to cover part of the deposits, probably one with a welcome bonus or rewards. The idea is to budget as though I were paying the deposits in smaller installments over a longer timeframe and pay it off before the intro period expires. But can I get a credit line high enough to matter? If not, should I apply for a second 0% APR card either at the same time or later? Apply for the card and then a smaller personal loan?

I don't have any experience with personal loans. It would be be an unsecured loan. Credit Karma* is showing me a loan that has no penalty for paying it off early, so I ideally could avoid some of the interest. If I go this route, I'm unsure what amount to apply for and how soon I need to do it.

(*Is Credit Karma reliable since the lawsuit? Where else should I look for offers?)

I've been planning to get a second credit card anyway and it will continue to be useful after the deposits are paid off. I prefer the flexibility of a credit card vs. a fixed monthly payment. The personal loan will probably have a lower interest rate than the card, but the actual amount of interest paid could be lower even if I don't manage to completely pay off the card before 0% APR ends. As I see it, the main benefits in favor of a loan are knowing exactly how much money I'm applying to receive and likely a higher amount. So which is the better option?",finance,1662850262

Quantitative easing pushes more money into the system and some of it ends up in the most risky asset out there, crypto. Quantitative Tightening does the opposite, it drains the global financial system of assets. This fits nicely with the narrative that crypto is at the tip of global liquidity system as central bank policy really only flipped hawkish last November, around the peak in BTC and ETH. 

Until the Fed starts increasing the size of its balance sheet, I think its a negative signal for bitcoin and crypto.

Read our notes to get an understanding of their views on the broad macro-outlook, the Ava Labs controversy, over compliance regarding sanctioned addresses, and more.

# Broad Marco Outlook

***Haseeb***:

● Now everyone has the same view on macro

● Zero alpha in predicting where macro’s going to go

● It’s weird that the intonations we hear in speech end up moving the markets

***Jill Gunter***:

● In general, she skews bearish

● Points how we’ll come full circle from the QE days, FED expanding their balance sheet, to now the FED trying to drain all the liquidity from the market due to a massive pump in the money supply

● My coffee is still getting expensive every day, and so there’s more liquidity that needs to be mopped up i.e. implying that inflation is still high

● Questions if monetary policy is data-driven

# Ava Labs Controversy

***Haseeb***:

● Gave TLDR, a video surfaced of class action lawyer Kyle Roche, allegedly intoxicated, having a conversation with Dominic Williams, an enemy of Avalanche founder Emin Gun Sirer.  Roche mentioned having significant amounts of AVAX and suing Avalanche competitors to deflect regulatory attention from the protocol.

● Avalanche team denied the claims and stated that they used Roche’s services early on in Avalanche’s history, they now have representation from 12 different law firms.  The Avalanche team also spoke out against the lawsuit against Solana.

● Kyle Roche later claimed that this was opposition research by the ICP team, crypto leaks is funded by ICP in some way

● Doesn’t believe this is much of a story

● Roche later claimed he was giving information from other lawsuits to other people, which could land him in trouble

***Tom Schmidt***:

● Questions the integrity of the cryptoleaks.info platform, stating that the three articles that have been published so far are going after people that are going after ICP, so he feels their biased nature is apparent.

● Speaking of the immediate dump of 20% in the price of $AVAX, Tom mentioned retail reflexivity, wherein someone heard bad news and panics, and then others join in as well

***Jill Gunter***:

● The latest article’s title doesn’t mention ICP, but once you read through the article, you do realize they seem biased towards ICP

● Even with the video evidence, it doesn’t appear that Ava Labs instructed Kyle Roche to take certain actions, i.e. sue their competitors.

● Roche could have been acting on his own accord, he could have had an interest in suing Avalanche competitors if he had a significant amount of Avalanche that he wanted to gain more market share

# Aftermath of the Tornado Cash sanctions

***Haseeb***:

● Tornado cash, a privacy-oriented mixer protocol on Ethereum was sanctioned by OFAC

● Circle, the issuer of the $USDC stablecoin, blocked addresses that had interacted with Tornado Cash

● Infura and Alchemy, which are RPC endpoints to interact within the Ethereum blockchain, blocked API requests to Tornado Cash

● The natural question arises, do we need decentralized RPC endpoints?

● Even pocket network, which claims to be a decentralized RPC endpoint for Ethereum blocked API requests to Tornado Cash.

● Flashbots, an integral part of the Ethereum mempool, and the largest off-chain MEV (miner extractable value) auction relayer, now integrates OFAC restrictions.

Ethermine, a big Ethereum mining pool, also started blocking Tornado Cash transactions

● There was probably a snowball, in that whoever decided to block reads and writes to the contract was followed by other entities

● Tether got this one right by not complying with the OFAC sanctions, as the ideal way to control illegal activity is by preventing people from cashing out

***Tom Schmidt***:

● It was much simpler in the past for these projects to sanction individual addresses from using their application, whereas now they must state that by default anyone who has interacted with tornado cash cannot use their project

● Aave runs its own front end, integrates with crypto compliance tooling like TRM, and has blocked addresses that directly used TC, or were one hop away

● 95% of Ethereum addresses are four hops away from interacting with a Tornado address.

***Jill Gunter***:

● Despite working in close proximity to regulators, Tether is not over complying

● OFAC is potentially using these sanctions as a way to influence the behavior of the parties involved (e.g. Infura, Tether, Circle, etc.), and in most circumstances does not force over-compliance

● Empathizes with companies being overly compliant

# The Role of Social Slashing, Compliance, and Privacy

***Haseeb***:

● Will there be OFAC complaint validators following the Merge?

● PoW enables miners in jurisdictions outside the US to mine transactions from sanctioned addresses, however with PoS the validation will be concentrated in the US

● Eric Walls’ plan to make Ethereum censorship-resistant is to use the concept of social slashing, a feature that allows the Ethereum community to come together and hard fork the chain, deciding to slash the stake of the validators who are censoring transactions

● Believes that immediately post-merge, validators (e.g. Coinbase) will stop processing Tornado Cash transactions

● Mentioned that FTX blocked users from interacting with Aztec, a privacy-focused ETH roll up

***Tom Schmidt***:

● Privacy may become mandatory if validators start sanctioning addresses on a mass scale and the burden of compliance grows

***Jill Gunter***:

● The idea of social slashing is problematic, how do you get to a consensus on who the bad guys that should be slashed are?

● Case of technologists wanting to technologize

● Should instead focus on educating the regulators, and help differentiate between what is the core tech stack, e.g. RPC endpoints, vs What protocols have specific intent to enable things like money laundering

● Need to figure out as an industry where exactly that line gets drawn

● Mentions the importance of not only transaction privacy, but also application/ protocol layer privacy

● Talks about how stablecoin providers need to implement some basic level of privacy to enable B2B payments, merchant payments, etc.

personalfinance,A family member has been scammed through online dating. I don't know what to do.,"Sorry, if this is not the right sub. But I desperately need help.

One of my closest family members of mine has been scammed through online dating for over 180k USD. Let's call her Jane.

I REALLY don't know what to do. MY ENTIRE FAMILY IS FREAKING OUT.

We can't believe how Jane can fall for such a simple scam. Through online dating apps, someone told her to go on to this fake website and buy Bitcoin and Ethereum. She transferred the money through WIRED transfer.

She used her entire life saving (45k) PLUS 180k loan through 4 separate loaning companies to buy bitcoin on this fake website.

I don't even understand how she got all these 4 loans (total 180k) when she makes around 50k a year.

BestEgg, SoFI, PenFed, TD Fit

loan 1 - \~20k 8% APY

loan 2 - \~40k 11% APY

loan 3 - \~20k 15%

loan 4 - \~20k 14%

Credit card 1 - \~8k

Credit card 2 - \~11k

This total is around 120k, Idk where the rest of the 60k is but this is the current information I know.

We really need to help her get out of this but it is hard to comprehend since it's just so much money.

We talked about helping her pay over the coming years or maybe just telling her to file for bankruptcy...

I really need some advice here.. to help her get out of this mess. Letting her die is not an option.

Few questions, I have in mind.

\- Is it possible to dispute with these loaning companies so we can pay off part of the loan and get it done?

\- If the worse case is to file for bankruptcy how would it work? She doesn't have any property but has a job. What's required? And how would it work?

I personally have 80k life savings, but to be honest, I really don't want to take out every penny I have. I am young and I literally just started my career 2 years ago and was planning to buy a condo....",finance,1662880871

vet,Upset stomach &amp; omeprazole (cat),"My cat hasn't been feeling too well this week. He was at the vet on Monday for his flea treatment and during the visit the vet recommended switching his food as I mentioned he hasn't been too keen on his food lately.

I swapped from Felix original to Purina Gormet and the first time he ate it, he wolfed it down. However, over the next few days his appetite decreased and was hardly eating. I now know that I should have switched food gradually. From Tuesday-Friday he didn't seem to have much of an appetite but was still eating a little and was acting normal however on Saturday he threw up bile so I took him to the vet again. 

The vet gave him an antisickness injection and prescribed him omeprazole which is to be taken once a day for five days. She also advised to feed him a bland diet of boiled chicken and rice. He is completely refusing to eat it and I'm worried that he is hungry and this may make it worse. 

I've also tried scrambled eggs and he won't touch it but anytime I go near the cupboard he meows as though he is hungry. 

My questions are, is it better to feed him small portions of the Purina gourmet if he is refusing chicken or just wait and hope that he eats the chicken?

Also, can omeprazole affect my cats appetite? How long does it normally take for the medication to kick in and settle his stomach? When should I be worrying/calling the vets again?

Months left: 42 (loan was for 60)
Current payoff amount: $6871.87

Min. Payment: $146.46
Months: 60

I would plan to use the remaining $128.13 from the loan as part of my first payment. I would also hope to continue to pay $300/month. This obviously sounds like the better deal but the contract states there is a finance charge of $1787.04 which means I would pay total of $8787.04. This still saves me a couple hundred dollars from my original loan but would I not be able to pay extra each month?

Putting aside any questions of whether we SHOULD take this on, would appreciate any advice about how we approach a home purchase.

Background: we have a mortgage, bought in 2020, great interest rate, good equity just from the market increases, but haven’t paid down that much. We’re both working and will probably have saved up enough for at least a 10 or 15% down payment by the time this needs to happen, BUT we have a young son so spending money on housing grandma really ultimately needs to become a long term investment to go towards our own retirement or his future savings for college etc. 

Meanwhile, MiL is currently renting and working a retail job, basically just breaking even and sometimes actively losing money each month. She was a private school teacher pre COVID, but got laid off and hasn’t been able to find another teaching job (probably due to her age?) She’s nearing retirement age, but truly has no retirement savings beyond what she can get from social security. We absolutely do not want her living with us and don’t have room for it even if we did. I feel like she might be able to qualify for income restricted housing and/or first time home buyer programs, but only if we gifted her a down payment. 

Alternatively, we could buy some level of investment property and let her live there for some amount of vastly under market rent as long as she’s able to work and live independently. 

The latter is our current plan, but I’m curious, is there any reason to pursue the former? Are there any programs out there that we’d be foolish to not look into? I know we won’t be able to get as good of an interest rate on a second home in the current / near future market. Meanwhile just subsiding her rent leaves us with nothing to show at the end and  the alternative is…homelessness?",finance,1662910971

CryptoCurrency,A World of Warcraft nerf was one of the reasons Vitalik created Ethereum,"Vitalik was born in Moscow and moved to Canada when he was a kid. There he started to play World of Warcraft.

“I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock’s Siphon Life spell,”


Siphon Life was indeed removed by World of Warcraft patch 3.1.0 — “Secrets of Ulduar,” the first major content patch for the Wrath of the Lich King expansion that launched in November 2008. Patch 3.1.0 rolled out April 14, 2009. Buterin was 15 years old at the time.

At the time it was nerfed out of the game, Siphon Life would transfer 15 health per 3 seconds from the target to the spellcaster, for a maximum of 30 seconds. Patch 3.1.0 replaced that with a healing effect caused by the Warlock’s Corruption spell — they get healing equivalent to 40% of the damage done by Corruption.


“I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.”

“I saw everything to do with either government regulation or corporate control as just being plain evil. And I assumed that people in those institutions were kind of like Mr. Burns, sitting behind their desks saying, ‘Excellent. How can I screw a thousand people over this time.’""

Edit: apparently Vitalik said this on other post about what he already said about Ethereum origens:

Background information:

\- Bought in December of 2020 with 2.5% interest rate at 383k owe 350k, current estimated value is around 550-600k. 3 bedroom 2.5 bath with study and theatre room around 3k sq ft. Located in a good area close to schools and there is a lot being developed around it. 

\- 6k monthly take home pay and will be promoted end of this year. WFH or travel for work.

\- Plan to split rent on a house in new location, current monthly living expense is about 3k+ and will be about 1500-2k.

\- If rented out I would use a property management company to handle day to day (this should be eligible as a tax write off).

\- If sold will be investing majority of the money into an ETF SPY/VOO and keeping some as emergency fund. 

I don't think I can go wrong with either choice, however given the current and future market what do you think is the best option? I am leaning towards selling it for a couple of reasons, the housing market is suppose to go into a downtrend for awhile, the house is a constant reminder of my past relationship, and I feel as though it would be a pain to have to keep up with it despite having a property management company (taxes, periods of no tenant and still paying mortgage etc.). The idea of someone else paying off my mortgage is attractive however, and I want to make the right decision.

2) Keep renting for $450 until we get a credit score (in about 5 months).

Talisman is already one of the easiest-to-use wallets in ANY market, but people still steer their Aunt Karen to a hardcore developer tool for her first experience, and she's going to have a bad time and never come back. Enough already. Leave the developer tools to developers and stop accepting a shitty user experience as part of the process.

See how you like seeing every single one of your balances in one extension window, ETH balances included, as opposed to seeing...oh right ZERO OF YOUR BALANCES in polkadot.js. Seriously, it's a wallet that doesn't show you your funds, why am I having to convince you of this to begin with?

Stop cosplaying a developer. Stop using a horrible consumer product just because you always have. Stop inflicting it on new people. Maybe we can stop losing people that'd rather be here to Cosmos just because Keplr isn't MS Dos in an orange box.

personalfinance,Finance new home construction without paying off existing mortgage?,"Background: My wife and I purchased a home last year when interest rates were low. The property is in a nice area but the house itself is pretty old and in need of improvement. The house is liveable but to completely remodel it and add a 2nd story exactly the way that we want will be tricky and we’re thinking of just completely knocking down and rebuilding probably within the next 10 years. We are in a high cost of living area and upon appraisal, the land is worth about twice as much as the existing home.

By the time we want to build our new home, we expect to be able to save up enough to pay off a significant chunk (if not all) of the mortgage but we won’t have enough to pay for both: pay off the mortgage and fund a new construction. Ideally we want to keep our existing mortgage since the rate is low and we want to put most of the money toward the construction instead. My question is if we want to demolish and build a new home, do we need to pay off the entire existing mortgage? Or can we get some sort of a construction loan against the equity in the land without fully paying off the existing mortgage? Wanted to check with others here on if they have suggestions on how to finance a new construction loan without paying off the existing mortgage especially in cases where the land is worth much more than the actual home",finance,1662973750

CryptoCurrency,UST And The Crypto Companies' House of Cards Continues With A 35 Million Loss,"Algorand released a few days ago that they lost access to 35 million USDC. This 35 million was invested in a project by the name of Hodlnaut. Yes, the name doesn't inspire much confidence. Basically, Hodlnaut functions like Celsius, the comparison is mostly used to describe only the similarity in their business operations, as they acted as a bank basically by taking user deposits and paying users interest and also lending those deposits to other users on margin. That is from what I could gather as eerily their faq page is currently down. The company claimed 20,000 users and around 250 million in assets with an interest APR of 7.5% with instant withdrawals which would be okay except we were/are in a nasty bear market.

Unfortunately, also like Celsius they suspended user withdrawals and are now in a legal process to determine if, when and how users will be reimbursed. They have also announced the cutting of **80%** of their staff. and dropped their interest rates to **0%.** They are technically not in bankruptcy but in something called ""interim judicial management"" where generally a company was mismanaged and is currently insolvent or seriously in financial distress but is expected to make cash to be able to pay off the debt in the future. So the company in essence receives new managers to ""fix"" the company who are external/unrelated to the company. They are not expected to go into liquidation i.e. sell large amounts of assets. For simplicity, it is not exactly inaccurate to think of it as something akin to restructuring or Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, however.

Algo claims this represents less than 3% of their assets and virtually wouldn't affect their operations or liquidity as far as users would experience. That may remain to be seen. But the real problem is this. Algorand invested in Holdnaut and Holdnaut invest in***...****drumroll please...* everyone's unfriendly neighbourhood crypto company **Terra.** As a matter of fact, Hodlnaut puts their financial distress down to the crash of UST in their media release. Another point to consider is that it is easier for these companies to have you believe it's all Terra fault since everyone hates UST right now and they make a good scapegoat and you won't be too mad at the company. I'm not saying they're lying but clearly a lot of these guys can't be trusted. The fact that they are in judicial management means Hodlnaut definitely had poor management so they are clearly culpable.

We know a lot of these crypto companies invest in each other but the more we find out the worse it feels. I really feel the people who ask questions on how to do your own research when a lot of the specifics of the info just aren't public. A good rule of thumb is just if it seems too good to be true it probably is. And even if it isn't you have to be realistic about and can't ignore market conditions. And if you can, try out a *truly* decentralized project, not something that functions on the whims of a few people at the top.

I'd love to hear what the general sentiment of Algo is.

personalfinance,23 and I feel Like I Can't Ahead,"My situation is I live in a medium COL area and I make 55k a year. I also babysit some and make an extra $200ish a month doing that. I graduated from college 2 years ago and finished paying off private student loans in July, and my federal loans look like they will all get forgiven. My rent + utilities is about $1300/month, no car payment, no credit card debt. I feel like I'm barely saving any money and I just don't see where I can cut back. I invest 8% of my paycheck in a roth ira and 401k, coupon for household items, shop at aldi for groceries, eat out maybe twice a month, go out to bars once or twice a month. No gym membership, phone bill, or health insurance payment at this time. I paid my car insurance for a year in full so I could get a discount. I stopped getting my nails done, buy almost all of my clothes secondhand, only get a new makeup or skincare product once every few months when I really need it. The only splurging I do is getting my hair done once every 3 months or so and that's about $130. That's a nonnegotiable. Of course different things come up every month (new tire, doctor's visit copay, buying a wedding or birthday gift etc), but I am very careful with my spending.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I feel like it doesn't look like I'm spending much money right? Well, I look at how much I have leftover at the end of every month and I'm just shocked at how little I have left to save. I want to buy a house, I want to eventually own rental properties, I don't always want to drive an old Honda, and it just seems impossible. If my car were to be totaled and I had to get a car payment, I'd literally be screwed. Looking at the job market I'm in, I have a pretty good salary for my experience/industry, and I want to stay at this job for a little longer for the sake of my resume. I job hopped a lot my first year out of school. I work from home and I'm stuck in my lease until the end of next year, so getting a roommate isn't a possibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously a reddit post doesn't show the total ins and outs of my financial situation and spending habits, but I'd say I'm pretty thrifty. What can I do differently to save more? What could I do differently to increase my income while having a full time job and also babysitting on the side? I feel so discouraged and lost. I don't want to just eat rice and beans all the time and never leave my apartment, but there's got to be something I can do.

CryptoCurrency,A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency:,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked off the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.

But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many argue it’s more secure because of it.

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each ADA coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each have their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What are Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That’s it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you may see a $65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway).

Currently there are 19,118,581 BTC out there at a cost of 24,340.01.

That means, the market cap is 24,340.01 x 19,118,581 = 465,346,452,725.81 (465B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,739,028,516. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price of .50 that means the market cap for Cardano is .5 X 33,739,028,516 =16,869,514,258 (16B).

You'll need a 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 30

33,739,028,516 \* 30 = 1012170855480.

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.23 Trillion. That’s only 0.11% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing”, find something with a low market cap regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech; the two Ts.

Also ask yourself:

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Take Luna for example. You probably lost your investment. Period. But, you never know.

Look at Ripple. Look at Shib.

Both were thought to be dead, but they live.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

Do your own research. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With chains like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata are things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.

Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.

But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.

Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.

IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A diamond NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in Decentraland, a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned; The asset is not stored in the blockchain.

What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

**Terminology?**

HODL = Hold On for Dear Life

Hopium = Represents the belief that the situation will someday improve.

FOMO = Fear of Missing Out

FUD = Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt

Bear/Bearish = ""Bears"" believe that an asset, for example a digital currency, will decline in value.

Bull/Bullish = If a trader believes that an asset will rise in value, he or she is a ""bull.""

Who me? I’m not a finical advisor. I work for a major software company as my full-time job, and manage Microsoft Active Directory and Azure AD. 📷I do however love the idea of blockchain, and what it can bring to the world.

personalfinance,How to properly plan now that we've deferred the house purchase,"Until recently, my wife and I (late 20s M/F) were set on buying a home in about a year's time in a relatively HCOL area. We have saved up about $100k for a down payment and were expecting to buy something in the $550-650k range. However, with the amount interest rates have risen and will likely in the coming months, making that purchase doesn't seem smart. We've just about made the decision that we will rent for now instead.

The question is what to do next, considering we would like to own a house in the next 3-5 years. My current thought is:

* Put the down payment money into index funds with no intent to withdraw in the next 2-ish years. Accept the risk of poorly-timed market downturn (would ride it out and delay the home purchase further) because holding that much cash for that long in an inflationary environment is just poor use of assets.

* Continue to aggressively save so that we can ultimately borrow less for the house, with a 30-40% down payment, making it more affordable with high interest rates. It feels likely that prices will continue to be depressed if interest rates are high, so we can take advantage of that environment and then refinance down the road once rates fall.

Does that seem like the right plan of attack? Appreciate any advice.",finance,1662992233
CryptoCurrency,Lendingblock WARNING: another CeFi company refusing to process withdrawals but never announced it.,"I had a little bit of crypto in Lendingblock thanks to their seemingly generous referral program and high interest rates. It's not a huge CeFi company, not compared to Celsius, but the red flags are now there.  

In January, I deposited some Bitcoin and earned about $133 in referral bonuses. Last week I tried to withdraw it, and they refuse to process it! First they told me I broke their terms and conditions and they could no longer provide me with service. The e-mail said they couldn't even tell me the term/service I broke. To me, this sounded sketchy as hell, so I emailed them back politely asking for more information. They replied back that, after further research, that my account HAD NOT broken any terms, but that they still refused to process the withdrawal because it consisted of referral bonuses, and they ""have paused paying out referral rewards.""  

The only problem is, they haven't announced this ANYWHERE. Even their last tweet on their twitter account August 15th states that business is going as normal:  https://twitter.com/lendingblock/status/1559246797742264323

personalfinance,Help with an issue with our CPA,"Hopefully this is the appropriate sub for this. Wanted to see if I was crazy or not: 

We have a fairly complicated tax return with multiple income streams via LLCs, rental properties, a lots of deductions. I prepare an incredibly detailed outline with each piece of info broken down by entity for our CPA (this is our 3rd year with him). It’s really organized as I want to make it as clear as possible what is happening. 

In early 2021 we had asked him (and paid for) an analysis of estimated taxes due on selling a rental property. I knew we would have some depreciation recapture with the gains. We ended up selling the property in 2021. I included this info on my outline. 

April 15 comes around and I ask for an update on our return. He says, “great news! You don’t owe anything this year! You’ll get a refund. But I need to file an extension.” We filed the extension. I was shocked by this because we had budgeted for $20k in taxes due from the rental property sale. 

I followed up with him several times over the next few months, and it was always “I’ll finish up soon!” He calls me in July and basically gives me a “whoops, I forgot about the sale of your rental property. You do owe taxes after all.” Fine, mistakes happen, but I was slightly annoyed since he had every bit of info needed. 

We now have state/federal penalties to the tune of $400ish. 

My question: Is it reasonable to ask for a reduction of our invoice for his services by that amount?

Of note- we have been happy with his work in the past and would like to continue working with him. He is not a new CPA and has 20+ years of experience. We have had some really poor experiences with CPAs in the past, including getting “fired” by another firm when I was agitated that they filed another client’s tax return under our SSN.

personalfinance,Buying a rental with US mortgage for foreign national brother,"Here goes nothing: I am a US citizen lucky enough to own several rental properties and a comfortable position in life. My brother is a foreign national with a B2 tourist visa to the US. In one of the buildings where I own a couple of condos, an opportunity has arisen for him to be able to buy a unit below market price. Lets call this a prospective condo. Based on my renting the two condos I own, I know the rent on this prospective condo will cover more than the mortgage and all other expenses leave him with say $1000/month etc. Throughout the scenarios I provide below, assume that my brother &amp; I are extremely close and I am willing to take any and all credit risks association with buying this rental &amp; allow him to take all the profits.

While he has the 20-25% down payment + closing costs my brother has no US credit score or source of income. As a result he does not qualify for a typical Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac mortgage that most people reading this qualify for. There are lenders who specialize in foreign national loans, but they charge 9%+ interest rate for foreign national mortgages (aka ITIN mortgages) while as a prime borrower I can get a 30 year loan on a rental for 5.5% today (9/12/22). Him paying 9% would eat into the cashflow and render the rental virtually not profitable.

The only remotely feasible solution I have found that minimizes tax liability, optimizes cash flow, and allows him to eventually take ownership is as follows:

I can have an agreement with him where he ""gifts"" me the down payment and I buy the property under my name with a mortgage (i.e., I am on the title, deed, and the note). Then I can rent the property to him with an option to sublease and he can sublease it to someone else. The rent I charge him would equal mortgage, property tax, insurance, and operating expenses. And the rent he charges someone else would be what he pays me plus a markup (which would be his cash flow).  On my taxes, my net income will be, by design close to $0. On his taxes (filed with an ITIN), his income will be the net cash flow (which would be under $12K ish so standard deduction should wipe that out and his tax liability will be $0. Once we refinance the property at a rate that we feel is low enough where refinancing may not be possible (say at 3% or so in the future), I can start giving him a gift of upto the annual gift tax exclusion ($16K in 2022) each year in equity and accordingly a share in profits. In around 20 years the rental will be his and during those 20 years, he enioys the cashflow without any tax liability.

Here is what I want from you: Advice on whether this is feasible or any alternative ideas. Here is what I dont want from you:  any discussion on how I am taking all the risk and he is taking all the returns.

personalfinance,is a second mortgage realistic?,"Hi there,

I would really appreciate some help regarding this topic as it has been very confusing on what is the best option. My parents are getting older and they sold their home, my parents and I are planning to live together and buy a home. They can buy a home all cash but my parents want to invest and save their money, and don't want to put all their cash into a house. They are both retired and can't get a loan. So they suggested I get the house under my name (first time homebuyer) and the loan, and they can pay 40% down payment to help with the current interest rates. The home we are buying is in Texas, I make 110k and the home is 500k. With 40% down. That means my mortgage will be 300k for 30 year conentinal loan.

Here is the tricky part, i will be living with my parents until I get married which is in 2-3 years most likely. When I try to get my own mortgage would it be difficult? Was thinking when I get married I might be able to convert the mortgage of this current home(the title will be only in my name) to a rental property and rent it out to my parents so they can stay in it.

2. Headline and core come in weak -&gt; dollar weakness
3. Headline strong but core reading above expectations -&gt; dollar strength near term 
4. Headline weak but core reading below expectations -&gt; dollar weakness near term. 

Here is the detailed explanation also. 

The headline expectation is 8.1% vs 8.5% yoy. Now before we say the headline is coming in bad we will have to watch for details in the report. 

Core inflation is expected +6.1% vs 5.9% yoy. What we need to watch out for is a bad headline with strong core inflation. If that happens the dollar will strengthen near term. So to say we need an all round bad report for the dollar to weaken. If we get a better than expected headline but weak core i expect the dollar to weaken near term but not as you might think. There will be bumps as the expected hike is still 75bps. I highly suggest you dont take random trades before the headline and 30 minutes after unless the report is crystal clear for long or short. If its not you might get whipsawed. 

The core reading/detail is the most important to look at because thats what the fed looks at too. So keep an eye on that and kinda ignore the headline but not too much. I hope you guys are ready and this helps you.

That followed a flurry of buying on Friday that sent the Cboe equity put-call ratio to the biggest drop since July.    
&gt;  
&gt; Fear of missing out is suddenly back in vogue after investors from day traders and professional speculators turned sour on equities. While risk appetite remained subdued amid mounting risk from raging inflation to war and a hawkish Federal Reserve, the urge to chase gains is creeping up.   
&gt;  
&gt;During the week through Thursday, hedge funds tracked by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought shares for the first time in a month, with the notional long buying reaching a one-year high, data from the firm’s prime broker show.   
&gt;  
&gt;As stocks climbed Monday for a fourth straight session, Danny Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler, noticed a rather large derivatives trade coinciding with the initial rally. One trader paid $90 each for 9,000 S&amp;P 500 calls with a strike price of 4,300 by December. The trade would be profitable if the index closes above 4,390 at expiry, he estimates. The benchmark gauge ended Monday at 4,110.41.

The S&amp;P 500 declined 4.2% in August as fears over persistently high inflation, aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and an uncertain global economic outlook have investors fleeing risk assets. The S&amp;P 500 is now down 17% year to date, but a handful of top-performing stocks have bucked the bearish trend. Top performers include several oil and gas stocks benefiting from surging energy prices and health care stocks with unique bullish catalysts. Here are the 10 best-performing stocks of 2022 among companies that trade on major U.S. exchanges and have market capitalizations of at least $1 billion. Returns are total returns, meaning they reflect the impact of any dividends and are through Aug. 31.",finance,1663047387
Forex,Will a weak US CPI print be enough to help EUR/USD break its downtrend?,"Despite causing USD strength to ease, expectations that today’s US CPI figures will bolster hopes of peak inflation hasn’t yet been enough to help EUR/USD break its bearish channel. 

The pair ran into resistance just below 1.0200 yesterday, preventing it from breaking the upper trendline. This could be an indication of a lack of demand for the Euro above these levels, and that sellers remain dominant given the EU’s economic backdrop. 

However, the ECB’s hawkish pivot, and Ukraine’s advances against the Russian military over the weekend, does seem to giving the Euro some support. If the actual print today can now signal a significant cooling in inflation, it may spark a shift in momentum and help EUR/USD break its downtrend as traders reposition for the possibility of the Fed slowing their tightening cycle next month.

Of course, all trading carries risk, and with another 75bps hike pretty much nailed on for next week’s FOMC Meeting, it will be interesting to see if EUR/USD can build on this recent rebound, or if it was just a “buy-the-rumour, sell-the-fact” type of move.",finance,1663056514
stocks,"Soft Landing More Likely Than Recession, Say JPMorgan Strategists. What That Means for Stocks","A soft landing is becoming a more likely outcome for the global economy than a recession, according to strategists at JPMorgan Chase. The avoidance of a global recession, along with moderating inflation and wage pressures among other factors, should continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, they added in a note. Within equities, the firm favors cyclical stocks, which it said should benefit from the gradual easing of inflation. They also like small-cap stocks and remain bullish on China and emerging-market stocks. 

“We maintain that inflation will resolve on its own as distortions fade and that the Fed has over-reacted with 75bps hike. We will likely see a Fed pivot, which is positive for cyclical assets,” they said. The bank’s strategists said economic data and investor positioning were more important factors for the performance of risk assets than hawkish central bank rhetoric. “The data appear to be increasingly supportive of a soft landing (rather than global recession), given moderating inflation and wage pressures, rebounding growth indicators, and stabilizing consumer confidence,” said the bank’s global markets strategy team.

The U.S. consumer-price index is due to be released later Tuesday and economists expect it to show that annual inflation cooled to 8% in August, from 8.5% in July. That would be the second consecutive month of decelerating price growth, and the lowest rate since February. “Our expectation that the global economy will stay out of recession, increasing fiscal stimulus (e.g. China and energy support in Europe), and still very low investor positioning and sentiment should thus continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, despite the more hawkish central bank rhetoric recently,” they added.

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street awaits key inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/stock-futures-are-higher-as-wall-street-awaits-key-inflation-report-.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were higher Tuesday as investors waited for an important inflation data point ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 207 points, or 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.7%.
*****
&gt; At 8:30 a.m. ET, all eyes will be on the August consumer price index report, which is expected to show a 0.1% decrease in headline inflation on a monthly basis, according to estimates from Dow Jones. On a year-over-year basis, the index is expected to show an 8% increase — down slightly from the previous month.
*****
&gt; The report is one of the last the Fed will see ahead of their Sept. 20-21 meeting, where they’re expected to deliver their third consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike to tamp down inflation.
*****
&gt; “The durability of the rally will likely be determined by Tuesday’s CPI report this week and the tone of the FOMC meeting next week,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.
*****
&gt; U.S. stocks rose Monday, continuing a relief rally that began last week when all three major averages snapped three-week slumps. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 230 points, or 0.7%. The S&amp;P 500 rose close to 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite added about 1.3%.
*****
&gt; Investors’ confidence has been bolstered by the belief that inflation has already peaked. A weaker dollar and military success in Ukraine also supported stocks.

A recent post I made reminded me that some people will blindly follow and defend the gov to the grave.

[https://np.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/xcsk15/did\_you\_know\_its\_a\_federal\_crime\_to\_leave\_nc\_with/](https://np.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/xcsk15/did_you_know_its_a_federal_crime_to_leave_nc_with/) 

In short the post was just an interesting fact that if you leave the state of NC with raw peanuts in the shell, dirt, sand, gravel separate or mix. You are breaking federal law. So like, if you visit NC and how there is always dirt in the air. Because that attaches to your clothes. By leaving NC with that dirt, you are technically are breaking the law.

For me it was just an interesting fact, but shockingly people were defending to an extreme. To the point someone said

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You can play ""what if"" all you want, but until your theories become reality, they are just ""what ifs.

[https://np.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/xcsk15/did\_you\_know\_its\_a\_federal\_crime\_to\_leave\_nc\_with/io7v6sx/?context=8&amp;depth=9](https://np.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/xcsk15/did_you_know_its_a_federal_crime_to_leave_nc_with/io7v6sx/?context=8&amp;depth=9) 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why this is important to note is there most likely will always be a large enough voice that always 100% backs the gov or current systems. Many times they won't even look at any evidence, but yet go on CNN or whatever yell about **Bitcorn mining is killing the planet**, or whatever.

# There is no fixing stupid. And something to note is the 5 laws of stupid.

## Law 1: Everyone always and inevitably underestimates the number of stupid people in circulation.

## Law 2: The probability that a person is stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.

So like they can be an expert in their field and still be stupid.

## Law 3: A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or group of people when he or she does not benefit and may even suffer losses.

# Law 4: Non-stupid people always underestimate the destructive power of stupid individuals.

## Law 5: A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.

Basically, stupid people are highly unpredictable

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For those who think the gov really can be trusted, and things are being overblown. This is what I told the person who mentioned I was playing with what if.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You went from Federal law to city law

The point of that video and story wasn't federal vs city. It is if a law is written wrong, then the gov can and sometimes does abuse it's power.

Just because 1 is federal and the other isn't, honestly doesn't mean that much. Both are human, and it is within human nature since greed is pushed as a backbone of society.

There is plenty of examples of FBI, ATF, CIA, NSA, and even military powers where they highly abused their power at given points in history.

&gt;You have this idea that anyone can simply go to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200; despite that, we don't actually have those issues.

Ruby Ridge, Banana Wars, and a shit ton of others as examples.

There is literally entire list out there showing a ton of problems.

FBI [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_FBI\_controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FBI_controversies)

ATF [https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/05/19/atf-s-greatest-hits](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/05/19/atf-s-greatest-hits)

&amp;#x200B;

I was giving a light hearted example with that city thing because the majority of the time when the federal abuses their power, people die.

&amp;#x200B;

# Hell, if you want the biggest example of USA gov abusing its power look up Japanese internment camps.

# Where people were sent there without trail, without breaking a single law, without a way to leave, and so on all because their parents were born in the wrong country.

This event btw, was a simple ""You have this idea that anyone can simply go to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200"". Look it up if you don't believe me. There was no trail, most were outstanding citizens, and yet they locked them up under military guard and gun.

It was so bad that a historical department in the USA was shut down after they took pictures and the military had a bitch fit about how the pictures of the camps would make them look bad, and how it was in the best interest of the nation to stop archiving and logging historical events in the USA. Then they tried to spend it as they were protecting the Japanese citizens when others got pissed from the stories that came out about the place.

# And this isn't even the last time when the USA locked up mass groups of people without a trail, them breaking crimes, and so on.

During Obama's term FEMA camps were used to lock up homeless under arm guards for a bit. Like they were giving a choice to go to the FEMA camp or go to jail. This happened in Boston, NYC, Colombia SC, and a few others.

Even in recent times 2021 a bill was brought up to do the same damn thing.

**Again ""anyone can simply go to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200""**

&amp;#x200B;

**And if you think the gov isn't actively abusing it's power right now. Look up civil forfeiture.** Where the gov has taken hundred of thousands of dollars from people because they THINK it COULD HAVE been used in a crime. NC luckily it is illegal for cops to use this FEDERAL LAW. But in states that allow this, there is a shit ton of stories. To the point where cops pull over those armored trucks over turn signal or honestly any other violation they can make up. Then make jokes about it when the amount in the truck is less than the cops thought they would get.

This isn't a you simply go to jail. But people literally have had cops take $100k+ legal money from them, trucks, houses, etc. All to get a kickback from the federal gov which is pissed NC cops aren't allowed to do this, and in recent times the federal gov tried to force their hands on this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You can play ""what if"" all you want, but until your theories become reality, they are just ""what ifs.""

If you think the gov is to be blindly trusted. Then you are a damn fool who doesn't know their history. It's in human nature to do this. This can be proven throughout history of humans.

To be clear, I'm not saying do something or we need to get rid of it. But after reading above and doing your own research. If you still blindly trust the gov, then it doesn't matter what someone says.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

1. Don't blindly trust the gov to do the right thing.
2. Don't blindly trust people to not blindly trust the gov to do the right thing
3. Don't be shocked when people are literally defending a system until and even after it has harmed others

So where the SEC wants to mess us over. Don't expect mass support from the public. But also don't take that as maybe we are in the wrong. Remember the first law of stupid.

gaming,Are there learning games?,"Hello,

I was looking for any recommendations of games that are suitable for primary children 4-11 that could work as a learning aid? Games where there's a lot of story to read, logical problem solving, critical thinking, spacial reasoning, things like that would be great. 

I work in school now but had a really rough start in schools.  As someone who is very dislexic (still can't spell the fucking word) had very little love for words because they were so difficult for me and thus very intimidating. My only motivation for learning to read was so I knew what was going on in early Final Fantasy game. And this didn't happen until I was 11, too late unfortunately. 

I feel in school there is a massive focus on reading novels and plays as beneficial reading. And that we must instill a love of reading in children, which we should. But only presenting children with one type of reading and I feel we could be doing better.

Studies have shown children on the spectrum are very uninterested in novels because they have no active role to relate to and feel very disengaged from stories about people. 

I've suggested maybe getting some comics and graphic novels in. But I would really like to put forward some games just to get kids motivated to learn. I know I loved logic games like Aibu (something like that) but would be very outdated now and not particularly interesting to modern fortnight fed children. 

Just wondered if anyone knew of some more modern learning games. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

CryptoCurrency,"Markets are cratering not because CPI deviated 0.1% from expectations, but because sticky inflation is soaring instead of showing any signs of reduction. The Fed really has its work cut out","Actual CPI print was 0.1%, and markets being down across the board doesnt make sense. SPX down 3.2%, QQQ is down 4%, Bitcoin down 7% following the CPI numbers. Except when you look at the actual figures that make up the CPI, it paints a gloomy picture of inflation. 

The baseline CPI is made up of several individual inflation components like Energy inflation, Housing, New/Used cars, Food etc. Each of these items is given a weight in consideration for the total CPI. 

For instance, energy has a 7% component in the CPI. In the just released CPI numbers, energy inflation fell by 5% compared to previous months. However, it was not enough to offset the increase in other components. 

**Sticky components** of the inflation means it is hard to bring this down easily without drastic policy changes. While energy component of inflation can be quickly brought down by lowering the price of oil and gas (supply/demand), prices of some components like shelter are not that easy to bring in control with just couple of policy changes. Shelter is a key sticky inflation component, and contributes 32% to the CPI. 

[It has risen by 0.7&amp;#37; in Aug 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/0noutjcpenn91.jpg?width=3148&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2e07650a1bccd34595aa5ae83009b06e108825b)

[https://www.atlantafed.org/research/inflationproject/stickyprice.aspx](https://www.atlantafed.org/research/inflationproject/stickyprice.aspx)

This simply means the current actions of the Fed are not proving to be enough. While gas prices have come down, prices of other essentials like shelter is soaring. This is a big jolt to the market and the current expectations are that rate hikes will continue way into 2023, while the market was earlier pricing slowing down of rate hikes towards the end of 2022. 

As you can see from the AtlantaFed sticky price index, it took several steep rate hikes + a recession to bring that in control in the early 80s.",cryptocurrency,1663084831
CryptoCurrency,Core CPI of 6.3% is what matters and crypto markets are going to respond in kind.,"The Fed's focus at this point is on core CPI which removes energy/food and not just the headline numbers. That number came in above expectations which signals to markets that the Fed is not only going to continue to be aggressive, but that it won't start the ""Pivot"" for a longer time. 

As as a result, crypto markets reacted and will likely continue to react towards the down side. 

My personal opinion is that if the capitulation we feared earlier in the year is going to happen, it's going to be during this period of contraction where strong downside moves are very possible and low valuations for extended periods are certainly possible.

Currently, I am 31 years old and single. I work as a radiographer in a hospital and take home minimum 4250/month, usually a bit more as we're understaffed and are asked to do overtime. My expenses are 2,700/mo including rent, food, car payment, etc. Everything left over goes towards paying down the balance on my loans, which are:

Car- $19,000 ($307/mo @ 4.25%)

Personal Loan- $3500 ($140/mo @ 10.49%)

Student loans - $3700 (after student loan forgiveness, not currently paying)

With that said, an opportunity has come up for me to pursue another professional credential. This would cost $3500, which I would have to put on a credit card (9.5% interest rate) but it would raise my income by at least 10k/year when I'm finished in about 4 months. I'm not sure if I should do this or not.

Also, I'd like to get an additional ""fun"" car that I like a bit more. This isn't completely necessary, just something fun I'd like to do for myself. I'd finance this and spend about 10k.

Is it possible for me to do both of these things in the near future?

# 1-The macro economic environment.

\-None of the micro economic data is as high or as bad as it was in June.

\-CPI for inflation may not be dropping as quickly as Wall Street wanted, but it has still slowed from 9.1% to 8.3% in 3 months. It would have to start increasing back to those highs, before we can talk about new lows.

\-GDP is growing again. It is up 1.3% for the latest September data according to the Atlanta Fed. And is on pace to be positive again. GDP is what recessions are measured with.

\-Unemployment is still at a low at 3.7% (but not too dangerously low), and 2022 has the highest wage increase in decades.

\-Housing and rent prices are beginning to cool off.

\-The supply chain is continuing its recovery. Which means everything from oil, lumber, food and goods, will be able to resupply more quickly and bring prices down.

\-Oil prices are low, and on pace to continue to dive, as demand is dropping, and China's economy is reeling and facing lockdowns reducing demand even further. While there is a growing oil supply coming on the market, mainly due to increased output targets, OPEC members still trying to play catch up on their quotas, Libya lifting its oil blockade, and the supply chain recovering.

\-The War in Ukraine has taken a u-turn, with now Russia losing territory and on the retreat.

Key take away:

None of the numbers that brought us at $17K are there anymore. Every month, we are getting further away from those numbers. And further away from a new low.

# 2- Every bull market becomes less intense, and as a result bear market become shorter and less intense.

Past bull markets from bottom to ATH keep getting less intense: In the 2013 cycle, it went x406. In 2017,  x109. In 2021,  x21.

Bear markets from ATH to bottom drop less each cycle: In 2014, Bitcoin dropped 86%. In 2018, 83%, or between 74%-76% if you remove the Hash Wars. So far, at the very bottom, Bitcoin dropped at a max of 74%.

Timeline from ATH to bottom, get shorter in duration: In the 2014 bear market, it took 405 days. In the 2018 bear market, 364 days. So far this bear market has been 308 days.

If there is another bottom, it would have to be within the next few weeks, or likely has already happened.

# 3- History often rhymes.

Comparison between the 2018 bottom (chart at the top), and the potential 2022 bottom.

# 4- The fuel for the correlation with stock markets is no longer there.

Some of you may have noticed that we've had days where Bitcoin is doing the opposite of what the stock market is doing. In fact, we seem to have a growing number of days like that.

That's because the correlation to stocks hasn't been growing since May. And has become less consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the Covid crash creating a hard reset for the Bitcoin bull market, putting it in synch with stocks, and liquidity coming in because of the Fed printers, Bitcoin has had a stronger correlation than usual to stocks.

But the monetary policy is no longer there. And sooner or later, the much more volatile Bitcoin market, will uncouple itself again, as stocks don't have the same volatility, and the same shorter cycles.

As time goes by, it becomes increasingly more likely that Bitcoin won't be able to stay tethered to stocks as much as it was in May and June.

investing,"We are 100% on track to 4%+ on federal funds rate in the near future (potentially 6%) Why are/aren't we in store for a ""Powell Shock"" (Volcker Shock 2.0)?","Inflation came in hot today. Fed has to do what they can to destroy demand to cool down the economy. Labor markets are still tight. Lower half of the economy is facing raising rent/food/energy prices that they can't easily absorb due to their low savings/low incomes.

Why is ""this time is different"" in 2022 for the Fed? Let's discuss. Why won't Powell be forced to raise interest rates to *at least* core PCE or above?

My personal take/guess:

If core PCE/CPI stay in the 6-8% range, once the fed gets rates up to 4% (which should be completed by November/December of this year), if inflation is still ""hot"", they'll probably be forced to hike rates even further at least match inflation. 400bps becomes 450bps which becomes 500bps, etc. That would take until about pretty much any time Q1-Q4 2023 (the FedWatch tool does not show anything 450bps realistically priced in whatsoever for the foreseeable futures) at the current pace.

I'm not sure what the ratio of ""federal funds rate -&gt; core PCE"" was during 1980 when Volcker put rates up to 18%. A quick Google says it was about 9%. That means it was 2x CPI/PCE (I know they aren't interchangeable, trying to keep this brief) -&gt; FFR.

What if there were a Smart Contract on the blockchain that:

* Allows people to show their support of an opposition anonymously, by adding their signature to a list
* The list is owned by nobody and the names stay unknown until a certain number of people have signed the list
* The list will not be revealed if that number is never reached; nobody will ever know that you signed on to the opposition if the number is not reached
* If the minimum number is reached (or has been reached by a certain point in time) the list will be published along with the statement

Is this a potential use case for a blockchain-stored smart contract? I have not a lot of technological knowledge but would love someone else's take on this.

personalfinance,what's going on here...,"So I applied for a personal loan through a group called bhg. 50k all together. The interest rate was better than my credit card rate so I used it for debt consolidation. I also told the guy selling me the loan that I was out unless they removed the prepayment penalties and he obliged and it says big and bold on the contract that can pay it off at any time with no penalty. Some of what the loan officer was trying to tell me seemed predatory but in the end I ended up with good loan terms I was happy with.

I am now working to pay it off. They sent an email a while back saying a different bank was providing servicing of the loan. Relyance bank. So expected that if I wanted to pay extra would do so with relyance since they process my monthly payments.

So it was a huge pain to get online access through relyance bank (it's an Arkansas bank and live in NJ and they were initially adamant that I open a checking account as well.). So when I finally log in, see that relyance had the initial principle balance of close to 75k. And the loan servicer there said they bought the loan for that amount.

So in a panic I call bhg who reassures me that the loan was not sold to relyance. And that my balance is what I expected it to be. All additional payments need to be made directly to bhg not relyance I was told.

So I feel better now, but I'm a bit weirded out that this bank in Arkansas has my social security number attached to a loan that is so much more than I owe.

And another thing am not sure if it's relevant but the bhg company doesn't report the debt to the credit agencies. That was a big thing they advertised although I didn't really care if they did or not.

Can anyone explain what is going on and if this is all ok? Initially I figured they sold the amount for what principle and interest would be over a set number of years or something. But have no idea.

CryptoCurrency,The launch of EDX Markets MIGHT be the best adoption story we have been looking for...,"As this market is entering the home stretch into the fourth quarter, it is hard to be as optimistic about any news related to full-scale adoption. In July, the SEC poured cold water on a Spot Bitcoin ETF application by Grayscale, inflationary pressures abound with high prices from gas to groceries, and most importantly, the Federal Reserve makes it harder for any risk-on mood to turn up with their rate hikes (September's rate could be arguably steep).

But this OP is to describe why I believe this launch of EDX Markets, a new cryptocurrency exchange backed by Trad-Fi, could usher in a serious adoption phase, and eventually, a new bull market for this very reason. The reason is that creating another exchange could provide unfettered access for any investor  -- both new and upcoming, and highly established, to invest or trade in Bitcoin, just like any existing crypto investor from FTX, Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, and the like. Why would this be the story of adoption for this bullish thesis? Because these investors have shown to those brokers that they do have a strong appetite for crypto, and who wouldn't miss out on the next bull cycle.

See, traditional finance players such as Schwab, Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade, among many other brokerages, realized that cryptocurrencies in their current form bring a lot of potential for their clients. Simply put, leaving cryptocurrencies out of their plethora of options that they could have taken advantage of would not make any business sense. In other words, these companies would not be seen as financial companies that are forward-looking when it comes to investment opportunities.

What it means for Bitcoin and crypto is that we should see this as a long-term positive development because new capital from investors who are coming to the market for the first time, will finally bring Bitcoin as alternate assets that compete with the likes of other commodities. Therefore, it will ultimately determine that the market may soon witness the start of something big in the coming months and years.",cryptocurrency,1663100497

Immediate trip to our vet who was able to get us in for an emergency visit, broken spine but no pain and is eating and drinking normally. Vet determined age to be about 4 weeks, advised we could do humane euthanasia or monitor for a couple days to see if he will have a bowel movement and use that for the determining factor for quality of life. We opted to monitor for a few days. 

We fed him some kitten food with water that he chowed down(per vets recommendation since he was eating hard treats they had), and he's napping happily in his temporary box home. 

Now, our vet knows us, and knows we will do anything for our pets, and probably assumes that will extend to this stray kitten and is willing to let us try to save this little guy. Cost is not an issue. All that being said, can this cat have a good quality of life long term? Im afraid our vet is trying to ""let us down easy."" Is there anything we can do to make him more comfortable in the short term? Vet said we could try to stimulate bowel movements but it may or may not make a difference.   Realistically, what am I looking at here?  How much pain will he be in if he's eating but can't poop due to paralyzation?  I know I should have asked the vet these things but I was not quite thinking very clearly.
_______________________________
Update, 3 days later for anyone curious- 

Kitten was able to urinate and poop on his own and is showing awareness of when he need to. Our vet thinks he may regain some use of at least one of his back legs based on it appearing to have some pain response and movement as of the appointment this morning (no pain response or movement was present in the initial visit)  Potentially a stroke instead of broken spine but not sure right now, and not doing any extensive testing at least for now. Vet reccomended some physical therapy (hydro and massage) to try to encourage as much back leg use as possible.  He's doing very well, good apetite, and has started playing and grooming himself in the last day or so. Poop is a little dry/dark and was prescribed a light stool softener. Scheduled a revisit in a couple weeks for checkup and standard vaccine rounds.  Overall has a fairly positive outlook. ✨️",cryptocurrency,1663105968

An American businessman was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large Yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied only a little while. The American then asked why he didn’t stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs.

The American then asked, “But what do you do with the rest of your day?”

The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, pay with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, and stroll the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, senor.”

The American scoffed, “I am a Stanford MBA and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the processor… eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution.

The Mexican fisherman asked, “But senor, how long will this take?” To this the American replied, “15-20 years.”

“But what then senor?”

The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part! When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich… You would make millions!”

“Millions, senor? Then What?”

The American said, “Then you would retire… Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”",finance,1663113343
personalfinance,looking for a strategy to tackle multiple double digit interest rate personal loans and credit card totalling around 19k,"title pretty much sums it up.. long story short, wife kept me in the dark on her debt as it spiraled out of control, we already handled the relationships and spending portion of it. I'm trying to figure out how I can pay this off in the most intelligent way possible.

loan 1

* min payment 127
* term 60mo
* completed 9/15/26
* interest rate 15.35%
* initial loan $6000
* remaining amount $4309

loan 2

* min payment 73
* term 60mo
* completed 12/13/26
* interest rate 17.85%
* initial loan $3500
* remaining amount $1996

loan 3

* min payment 89
* term 7mo
* completed 3/29/23
* interest rate 17.35%
* initial loan $500
* remaining amount $500

credit card

* min payment 0(cant see it currently as i just put some money on it)
* interest rate 16.9%
* cash advance limit reached
* monthly interest is \~$179(total for cash advance interest and normal interest)
* remaining amount $11,971

&amp;#x200B;

the only other debt we have is student loans, which as you know, are paused. I would like to make sure im covering interest and principal every month until the new income-based repayment scheme takes effect so a significant portion of our income will be going to that.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already minimized our living expenses as much as possible, after all other living expenses and paying the minimum amount on each debt, I have $1,269 leftover per month until jan 2023 at which point student loans enter repayment, then I will have $668 leftover. Then that amount will likely drop again in may of 2023 to maybe \~$600 per month as i have to renew my lease and i expect my rent will increase.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm essentially stuck with a paradox of choice in how to approach paying this off, my credit score is 766 and my wifes is 706. Part of me wants to take out a personal loan and do a debt consolidation route(my bank considers a personal loan and debt consolidation loan the same when it comes to approvals, a representative told me the personal is less questions/hoops); the savings in interest paid would be around 3k, but to be comfortable I would probably have to do a 2.5-3 year loan. Another part of me wants to keep the loans intact and pay them as is and do a balance transfer on the credit card and take advantage of a 0% interest balance transfer scheme but I would need to find a card that had it for at least 19 months as thats how long it would take with what I would have left over every month..  I'm not confident enough in either of these choices to pull the trigger and am terrified in general of whats going to happen with the economy in the next 1-2 years and am trying to get over having such a large sum payment looming over my head every month in an economy where myself or my wife might become jobless, which i guess is a good time to mention we have 0 savings, although part of my monthly expenses are working towards reconciling this(wife was out of work for the past year).

Forex,How to actually make easy money trading forex,"This is the simplest most brain dead way.

1. Look macroeconomically at fundamentals. Find some bias that you think will happen no matter what.

For instance my bias is AUDUSD to as low as possible. Why? Because living in Australia I know the place has an insane housing market that all of the politicians are invested in. I know raising rates would threaten this.

So for all the hollering about 'matching the US fed' when raising rates.. I bet.. when push comes to shove Australia will not hike rates to protect their housing market. Thus AUDUSD will collapse. Ya ya.. independent fed my ass. I know all you elite clowns are in on it...

2. Down cost average small pieces with no stop loss. Remember, you want ot be able to have it move thousands of pips against you without getting margin called. Use 0.01 lots of you have to.

3. Use RSI as entry. Whenever RSI goes above 60. Just buy another 0.01 lots short on AUDUSD.  Do this for months and months.

Be 100% prepared to lose your account if you are wrong on the macro economic calll.. but either your right or your wrong. 50/50 at worse... Which is a lot better odds than 98% of traders blowing their account and losing money on forex.

You will make 400-500% after 6+ months of this on a decent directional call.

You will lose 100% of your starting account if you make the wrong call. Your margin call and zeroing of your account IS your stop loss. Don't be afraid of this. The reality is your are extremely likely to blow your account to 0. You can do that by  trading like a normal person, having a stoploss and watching your account get chunked bit by bit until you lose control and go 500:1 and blow it... Or you can do the sensible thing and take a 50/50 shot.

Don't be greedy. Get out at 400-500% no matter if the call still continues and start a new account.

Its slow but it is profitable.

personalfinance,Help understanding why I owe previous company,"Greetings!

For the sake of anonymity, I'll refer to my previous company as ""fubar"".  Also info provided uses redacted values as well as other fake info, but ultimately hoping those aren't important and they help to provide insight as to what's going on instead.

So today, FUBAR sends me an email stating that I owe them $400 (fake value).

This is the wording that was provided:

&gt;When your final check was processed, a correction was made and was processed again.  The incorrect final check was voided at the same time.  Due to the timing of when the checks processed and when you reached the Social Security Maximum taxable amount of $147,000 – the final amount was shorted.  This is because when the second check processed, you reached the cap.  Then the reversal check processed and there were $400.00 less in deductions.  When the incorrect check was voided, your taxable earnings went below the maximum amount.  At this time, FUBAR has paid $400 to ensure your social security taxes were paid timely and correctly. 

Also provided in the email is some sort of table data, showing the following.  It showed some other checks, but ultimately I think those are irrelevant.. these two entries show a voided then a reversal from the bank, which were also highlighted in red:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Check #|Taxable amount|FICA|Correct Fica|Amount Owed||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|01/01/9001|1337|10,000|1000|1000|0|Voided|
|01/01/9001|1337|\-10,000|\-600|\-1000|400|Reversal|

&amp;#x200B;

They then go on to say that I owe them $400:

&gt;You can write a check to FUBAR for the full amount or you can allow us to deduct them from the federal income tax that we have already withheld from you and apply it to your balance.

&amp;#x200B;

So... I guess there are three questions here:

* I've re-read this email like 100 times and I'm still utterly confused as to wtf is going on... can someone maybe explain it in a different way or something?  I'm just not grasping it...  It's so confusing and maybe I just need pictures or something...
* Is this actually a thing?  Or can I tell them to go pound sand?
* If I opted to just have it removed out of fed tax witholding, I'm assuming that amount just finally catches up to me at tax time?  In the form of a tax payment (or, potentially reduced amount owed to me)?

&amp;#x200B;

I do plan on calling the payroll dept tomorrow to get it sorted out, but mostly I wanted to try to come armed with knowledge before that call.  I will get their phone number off FUBAR's site and call that rather than using the one in the email.   Initially I thought this was some kind of scam, but maybe not?  Anyhow... hoping maybe someone out there can help out a dumbfounded individual on this topic :)  Thanks!",finance,1663122519

business,A little lost and not sure what to do :(,"I unfortunately wised up and matured much later than I should've been, and now that I have shit figured out and want to follow up with aspiration... I donno what to do to escape the 9-5 trap and find way to be financially free with middle-upper class lifestyle capabilities.   


TLDR: I'm hoping to find a business that can scale with decent chance of success and requires minimal capital. Such thing probably don't exist, but I figure why not? Could also use a mentor. I have no debt and thirsty to not worry about finance and find some freedom where I could feel fulfilled in limited mortal lifespan.  


  
Full context:  


Currently depending on IT job and hoping to break from tier1/2 to tier3 and above and hope for more comfortable 6 figure income and become much harder to replace (ideally with more flexible remote work... maybe via corporate contract where I don't have to be in one particular country for traveling freedom and tax advantages). My one criminal record makes it difficult at least until I have enough experience and know-how (supplemented by certificates), but that's a long way to go (and not even sure if I can)  


Started a boutique hedge fund with great returns back in 2021 using partially my money but mostly my parents. My parents got spooked by 2022 market and wants to put investment on hold until bull market resumes again. I understood their position and respect it but it was painful as that was my only realistic way to get ahead in timely manner. I work with  a business partner who is far more competent with leveraged midterm investments who manage risk very well, so my current goal is to build 400-600k USD together to start again on our own (and we'll manage the parents' savings again if they want to resume but that way we don't get rug pulled if they get spooked again as that investment revenue is like oil revenue for the Saudis).   


9-5 won't help me get there unless I work for decades. I need something else that I can scale and network so people can work for me (and they will also get paid accordingly for their effort ofc). So far the only thing I can think of is me helping me out with a guy flipping used cars for living. He has a big buyer clientele so it's a bizarre situation where we have healthy demand but limited inventory. I made some decent money thus far and I'm working with some rich network so they can get me more cars. But flipping car is like great recession right now cause no matter how much price goes up or down, you can't make deals without car inventory. I am sure it'd get better if we can survive the economic volatility and when the cycle circles back, but who knows when that would happen. Since it's commission based job, I can always try what I can and start doing far better when shortage heals in few years or more.  


But I want to do something. I'm ambitious and I don't mind putting a lot of hours and face rejections here and there. But everything seems so risky... with gloomy economics and high interest rates/inflation I can't think of any business that would thrive in this situation :( My buddy knows a guy who is broker in weed business and even he tells me it's rough competition is fierce and demand is dialing down. Weed that used to sell 2k USD is now barely selling for maybe 1100 or so. Real estate/airbnb requires big capital and it's nervous to buy now when property bubble hasn't fully popped yet. My buddy was even thinking about maybe breeding rare pets, but they are just as hard due to various elements (like finding sperms with expensive price, finding a good place to raise them, network, etc). I even flirted with the auction idea with a lady who does that for hobby, but sale is slow (and since it's auction deal so many flakes or just asking at stupid price, storage issue, etc). And even that lady is getting old and tired and I can't depend on our teamwork to scale it up :(  


I'm feeling miserable that I can't find something that I can build and own that can lead to financially freedom. It feels like at this point, I just pray I meet someone who figured it out and have amazing business that is thriving and hope to learn the rope and maybe even manage it for the owner for modest profit and either expand his business or build my own I donno... I always go to bed wondering how do I go from here to where I want to be?

I don't have expensive taste, but I would like to make enough to travel at least once a year and not worry about living just above a modest lifestyle without checking my bank account. I want a business where others work for me and I spend most of my time networking and managing than doing the labor work myself.   


Sounds like fantasy, but I figure I'd put this out there and see if maybe I'd meet someone or hear some advice/suggestion that could change my life for the better :/

CryptoCurrency,"Inflation generally increases the price of bitcoin, when will people understand?","If the dollar inflated 1,000% this year, what do you think will happen to bitcoin’s price? 
Conversely, if the dollar deflates 1,000% (buying power of the dollar increases 10x), what do you think will happen to bitcoin’s price?

Bitcoin increased from $10k in 2020 prepandemic to $69k in the end of 2021 on the rumor of hyper inflation in the US. This was driven by the [belief that 80% of the dollars in existence were created since 2020 pandemic](https://techstartups.com/2021/12/18/80-us-dollars-existence-printed-january-2020-october-2021/). While this belief isn’t entirely accurate when looking at macroeconomics (how could it be 100% accurate, when dollars supply is not auditable and the actual amount in existence isn’t actually known) it’s also not entirely inaccurate either. [Money is actually mined, or created, by lenders.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2017/10/31/how-bank-lending-really-creates-money-and-why-the-magic-money-tree-is-not-cost-free/amp/) 

&gt;&gt; Money is created when banks lend. The rules of double entry accounting dictate that when banks create a new loan asset, they must also create an equal and opposite liability, in the form of a new demand deposit. This demand deposit, like all other customer deposits, is included in central banks’ measures of broad money. In this sense, therefore, when banks lend they create money.

And during 2020 til this year, there has been historically low interest rates and an immeasurable amount of lending, and thus, an enormous increase in the (unknown) money supply. 

Then inflation data finally starts to be published, and it’s not as bad as it seemed, with CPI at only 9% this year.
Classic buy the rumor sell the news scenario.

But there’s more to the story.

Inflation data by the government needs to be taken with a grain of salt, since they have a conflict of interest in reporting it. This is why the CPI is adjusted regularly, and is only based on what is being purchased rather than the actual change in price.

If something becomes unaffordable, then it becomes purchased less and gets less weight, thus lowering the CPI value.

An example, if you make $10 per day and your only expense is food and you buy a $10 quality ribeye meal every day, you are living paycheck to paycheck. During a period of hyper inflation, your ribeye can become $30 instead, so unless you get a raise your spending power won’t keep up. Instead, you’ll need to buy a Big Mac for $10 to stay in budget. The ribeye would be thrown out of the CPI, since you’ve stopped buying it, and magically the cpi will report no increase since your spending didn’t increase even though inflation was 300%.

My conclusion, is that this recent crash is an overreaction and historically a very normal part of the market cycle, as bitcoin’s price has fallen 80% from the ATH many times since it’s very short lifespan thus far. Also, that inflation will cause bitcoin’s price to increase over time, not decrease, due to high inflation.

Edit: some credit needs to be given to Saifedean Ammous, author of the Fiat Standard, as my example of how CPI downplays inflation is almost directly from his book.",cryptocurrency,1663135220

personalfinance,Roth IRA for down payment savings,"Hi r/personalfinance, I’m considering using my company’s new Roth IRA option to (partly) save for a down payment on my first home. It seems like a lot of people recommend against this option but I’d like to know more about why. 

It seems like the number 1 argument is “don’t withdraw from retirement early.” And that makes sense - if the money is meant for retirement. But this is money I’m not saving for retirement, it’s for my first home. Some relevant info about my personal situation:

33 years old 

I have 50k in traditional IRA accounts now

20% savings rate - 10% me, 10% employer match, fully vested w no wait period 

51k income (after recent 5% raise)

5k in emergency fund (some of which I’ll probably invest in bonds which are apparently a good deal now) 

Living and working in the US 

Will not buy for at least another 5 years 

So investing in the Roth option isn’t a “I’m withdrawing from retirement early” situation - it’s an “I plan to invest in Roth accounts to earn a higher interest rate than a HYSA.” 

I understand the market is never a guarantee, but I’m not on a set timeframe. Also I am not putting ALL my down payment savings in Roth- some will be in HYSA and bonds took 

My honest question: What am I missing? What negatives are there - that apply to my situation - that I am not accounting for? Do I need to save even more for retirement than I am now?",finance,1663157239

&gt; The market moves came after August’s consumer price index report showed headline inflation rose 0.1% on a monthly basis despite a drop in gas prices.
*****
&gt; The hot inflation report left questions over whether stocks could go back to their June lows or fall even further. It also spurred some fears that the Federal Reserve could potentially hike even higher than the 75 basis points markets are pricing in.
*****
&gt; “It caught the market off guard,” said LPL Financial’s Quincy Krosby. “The market had been expecting at least that we had leveled off — perhaps not moving downward but certainly not climbing higher. It was the wrong direction and the concern, of course, is always translated into what does this mean for the Fed.”
*****
&gt; All 30 Dow stocks and S&amp;P 500 sectors finished the session lower, led to the downside by communications services. The sector fell 5.6% and finished its worst day since February, dragged down by shares of big technology names like Netflix and Meta Platforms, which tumbled about 7.8% and 9.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; A reading of the producer price index is due out Wednesday morning and could offer further clues into the state of inflation before the Fed’s rate-hike meeting next week.

If I take out a loan at 10K, I just need to pay back about 421 per month for the next two years. It will be deducted from my salary automatically. I always save half of my salary to my PEA (French version of IRA) anyway. My direct managers also won't know about this. 

I plan to put half of the loan into a savings account and the other half into short-term inflation-protected bond ETFs like VTIP (which currently yields near 6%, but has gone almost -5% YTD).

personalfinance,Will housing be more affordable anytime soon (within 5 years),"Looking for information and/or thoughts on if the current economic landscape will become more favorable as it relates around the U.S. Housing market. Will it ever get better/more affordable to own a home? I realize interest rates are still historically low, but compared to what they have been it makes a 30-yr mortgage super expensive.

Personal info related to question. Wife and I purchased our small 996 sq ft home with basement (2/2 bath upstairs, one bedroom downstairs) in 2013 for $295k. Put five percent down and got a 30 year mortgage with a 3.5% interest rate. At the time we were unsure when and if we'd have kids. Well now we have 2 kids, a 3 yr old and 4 month old and we really need another bedroom - we intended to have the kids share a bedroom until we could move into a *slightly* larger home, but that is challenging as the 3 year old has sensory processing disorder and is a very light sleeper. Anyways, we definitely missed the most opportune time to by a new house which was 2 - 3 years ago. Everything now is super $$ on top of higher interest rates. For example, to buy our same house today would result in basically DOUBLE the cost for monthly payment than we paid 9 years ago. Our income has NOT doubled in the same time period. I fear without some significant drop in rates/market it is going to be extremely difficult for us to get a slightly larger home. Even an addition is crazy expensive. I realize we are lucky to have a fixed mortgage even if we are cramped to the max in our current space - renters are really getting screwed.",finance,1663162348

I'm thinking about putting the money instead in 3 month duration treasury bills. Rates are higher than high yield savings accounts and I can time them so they mature every quarter in time for the next Fed rate hike.

My long term goal is to wait until Powell is done with rate hikes and a possible recession hits and then return to going all in on total market index funds at some point.

Are there any risks involved with going all in on treasury bills? Am I making a mistake trying to time the market and should I DCA back into total market index funds instead? I'm worried about going back into the market when it seems we'll remain in a bear market until the Fed gets inflation under control.

CryptoCurrency,"Maybe technical analysis is not the answer and we should just countertrade people like Bitboy, MMCrypto, The Moon Carl, and Jim Cramer instead","Over the past few weeks there have been a lot of debates on the merit of technical analysis, whether it can be used to predict market movements.  But perhaps we have been making it too difficult for ourselves, and all we simply need to do is countertrade the idiots in this space? By idiots I mean the social media influencers who always make wrong predictions.

A quick analysis of the social media of such figures leading up to yesterday's CPI reading could have given us strong signals that we were going to dump hard. Let me illustrate with a few very useless social media influencers (MMcrypto, The Moon Carl, and Bitbot) and someone from traditional finance (Jim Cramer).

MMCrypto, a popular crypto personality and YouTuber, has bagged the award of the top crypto influencer in crypto of the year 2021. I have no idea why, because he is always wrong and led many people to the slaughter by being overly bullish at (local) tops.

The Moon Carl, a popular crypto personality and YouTuber and waste of a human being, was long going into the CPI reading, gloating about his profits. It is probably play money, because he was once revealed to do these bets with play money rather than actual money, lol. We should have known.

A little bit before the dump, Bitboy was gloaing that bears were on the run and gone. We should have known.

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Cramer, known for the inverse cramer, was predicting the FED was winning against inflation the day before the biggest dump in the Nasdaq since June 2020. Oops!

&amp;#x200B;

**What's next?**

Thankfully, even those of us that missed these signals, will be okay from hereon, because we are about to pump. Why? Well, the new predictions are incredibly bearish. So HODL seems to be the way.

My two only concerns are total cost and impact on my credit score; which of these options do you think sounds the best?

The bank said they'll defer to the end without changing my interest rate (2.99). I heard that this can have a huge hit on credit.

It's a VA loan, so VA Partial Claim Program is an option, but the bank said that this would include a loan modification, which would increase my rate to 3.99. (Are they being honest? I can't find anything on the VA site mentioning anything about a modification)

I could take a personal loan, and pay it off that way; ignoring the cost, would this look better or worse on my credit score?

I got an offer for a business loan that won't report to my personal credit at a decent rate; I can take a loan from the business account. This costs more, but it'll means that my credit score won't take a hit.

Anyways, we've put in a reservation for a 2023 Ford Mach E CR1 trim which will come in at around ~$65k before taxes and any potential incentives. It likely won't be ready for 8 months to a year so still plenty of time to save up more for a potential down payment. We're probably going to be looking at a 60mo loan through Navy Fed. A quick google search says their rates are around 3.5%-4% for that term.

I'm just unsure if it'd be smarter to put as little down as possible, basically just pay title fees and registration taxes, and invest the rest like I do normally, or put like $15k-20k down to reduce the monthly payment.

Here are the numbers for me and my wife:

- Combined monthly income after taxes/deductions: ~$12-13k
- Mortgage: $3100
- Bills/Utilities: ~$500
- Average monthly CC: ~$2k-3k
- Mortgage is our only debt, my wife might have a small CC balance &lt; $2k or so. I have none.

I found an online calculator assuming 0 down and like 3.5% it looks like our monthly would be about $1k/month + adding it to our existing insurance (haven't looked up what that would be yet). We can definitely afford that, I'm just not sure if it's smarter to put money down to reduce the payment and the amount we pay over the life of the loan, or to put less down since it's a depreciating asset and invest the rest or use it to save up for projects on the house. Let me know if I should provide some more information, most of these numbers are estimates off the top of my head but should be fairly accurate since I handle most of our finances.",finance,1663175075
personalfinance,Which debt should I focus on?,"I've got some extra money that I wasn't expecting coming in this month and I want to use it to pay down some of my debt. Under my current plan (not including the extra money this month) I'll be totally out of debt around April. It's down to two of them. The interest rates are highish because my credit isn't great. But hey, it was beyond terrible a few years ago, so ""not great"" is a pretty big improvement.

The first debt is a store credit card. Due to promotions on some of my purchases, I have $325 on it that is zero interest until December After that the interest rate will be 28%

The second debt is... um.... wierd. I picked up this $2500 loan at 98% APR to pay off a 400% APR loan (I failed to read the fine print on that one). Yeah, normally 98% APR is atrocious and I wouldn't have considered it, but it's a massive improvement over what I WAS under. What makes it weird is that for every 6 months that I make my payments on time the interest rate drops by 2%. The payment schedule goes for 5 years if I make just the minimum payments, and for the first 6 months I'm paying nothing but interest. My current plan includes paying this monstrosity off with my tax return (I intentionally have extra pulled out of my paychecks so I always get a big return - had to pay in once and decided not to ever let that happen again).

Now here's the debate. Would it be better to use that extra money to pay off the zero interest stuff before I start getting charged interest for it or do I use it to give myself a big jump on the high interest loan?",finance,1663176019

CryptoCurrency,"Matt Levine's thoughts on The Merge from ""Money Stuff"" newsletter","Today Matt Levine from Bloomberg had a section about the Ethereum Merge in his newsletter so I thought I would share it.

It's kinda long, but it's a good read from non-crypto-bro perspective, here's a summary:

He starts by giving a layman-terms overview of blockchain and bitcoin, then explains how Ethereum will be different after The Merge. Highlights some clever innovations and some problems with the protocols. He then gives a really interesting tradfi perspective of the economic model of PoW and PoS and how they relate to crypto futures market, making some predictions on how The Merge will effect ETH futures and touches a bit on staking ETH.

## The Merge

The idea of a blockchain is that you want to  do bank transfers without a bank. You want people to be able to do  transactions, and have them confirmed, and have there be some canonical  agreed list of the transactions, but you don’t want to trust some  central party to do it.

At a high level, the blockchain solution is  to confirm transactions by letting everyone keep a copy of the  transaction ledger. And then the official ledger is based on consensus  among people who have some demonstrated stake in the system. What that  has often meant in practice — [what it means in Bitcoin](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly9iaXRjb2luLm9yZy9iaXRjb2luLnBkZg/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baBd4508c2f) and what it [originally meant in Ethereum](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldGhlcmV1bS5vcmcvZW4vd2hpdGVwYXBlci8/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baB49b07999)  — is “proof of work.” What you do is, you buy a bunch of computers, and  you set them to work solving meaningless math problems, and whoever  solves the most math problems the fastest gets to confirm a block of  Bitcoin transactions, and they are rewarded with some newly minted  Bitcoins and then everyone starts over solving more math problems to  confirm more transactions. Buying the computers, and paying for the  electricity to run them to solve the math problems, demonstrates your  commitment to Bitcoin: It would be crazy to spend all that money on  computers and electricity to confirm *fake* transactions, which would undermine the value of Bitcoin and thus of your investment. \[1\]

This is called “mining”: You spend money on  computers and electricity, and then you are rewarded with newly created  Bitcoins. And there are people, and publicly traded companies, who are  in the business of Bitcoin mining and thus of maintaining the Bitcoin  network. The inputs are electricity and the outputs are Bitcoin.

This was a clever innovation and has some  important benefits. It lets you have a ledger that is maintained by  people with incentives to do the right thing — people you can trust —  without knowing who they are. There is no pre-approved list of people  who are allowed to maintain the Bitcoin ledger; anyone who buys enough  computers and electricity can participate. It is [  permissionless](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDktMTMvY3J5cHRvLXdhbnRzLXNvbWUtc2VjLXJ1bGVzP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA5MTQyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDkxNCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baB9f3b11b5).  But because they have to buy all those computers and electricity, they  have good incentives to maintain the ledger in a good way.

But there are some problems. The biggest is  that it uses a ton of electricity solving pointless math problems, which  seems wasteful both in environmental terms (you’re emitting a lot of  carbon to generate all that electricity) and [ also in economic terms](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly92aXRhbGlrLmNhL2dlbmVyYWwvMjAyMC8xMS8wNi9wb3MyMDIwLmh0bWw/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baB40d489ec)  (the Bitcoin system is effectively paying utility companies a lot of  money to maintain its ledger). Developers of later blockchains realized  that, if the point here is to have transactions confirmed by people with  a demonstrated stake in the system, there are easier ways to  demonstrate a stake in the system. \[2\]  Most simply: If you have a lot of Bitcoins, you will want Bitcoin  to be valuable, and so you will want to confirm transactions honestly in  order to keep Bitcoin valuable. Instead of proving that you have an  economic stake in the system by spending a lot of money on computers and  electricity, you could prove that you have an economic stake in the  system by spending a lot of money *on Bitcoin*. If you have a lot of Bitcoin, that proves that you care about Bitcoin, so you get to participate in confirming transactions.

Well, that is not how Bitcoin works, but it is how Ethereum works starting, uh, today-ish. Bloomberg’s [  Olga Kharif and David Pan report](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDktMTMvd2hhdC1zLWV0aGVyZXVtLWV0aC1tZXJnZS1wcm9vZi1vZi1zdGFrZS1kaWZmZXJzLWZyb20tYml0Y29pbi1idGM_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDkxNDIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwOTE0JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baB89c51807):

&gt;Ethereum is about to get a makeover. The  popular crypto network that runs Ether, the world’s second-most-valuable  digital currency, could morph as early as Sept. 14 into a configuration  that shakes up the entire crypto universe.The long-anticipated software change, “the  Merge” to crypto fans worldwide, will lower Ethereum’s energy use by  99%, silencing critics who dislike the blockchain for its electricity  consumption—enough to power Finland for a year by one estimate. …Ethereum’s new process will rely instead on  what’s called proof of stake. It consumes very little power, because it  doesn’t depend on miners. It does require entities called validators to  put some skin in the game in the form of Ether coins. Staking, or  putting coins in the pot, gives large Ether owners the right to add a  block of transactions to the ledger; they’re rewarded with new Ether  when they do so. All Ether tokens will now pay interest when placed into  staking wallets. The software upgrade is called the Merge because the  existing Ethereum blockchain will combine with a parallel network that’s  been running for almost two years to test the proof-of-stake concept.

If you have a lot of Ether, you can stake  them and be a validator and confirm transactions and get rewarded with  additional Ether. Or, if you have a smaller amount of Ether, you can  delegate them to a validator: You hand them over to some validator that  you trust, and that validator can stake them and confirm transactions  and get rewarded with additional Ether and give you some of them. In  practice, it is natural for [ big crypto exchanges](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvaW5iYXNlLXdvdWxkLXJhdGhlci1zaHV0LWRvd24tc3Rha2luZy10aGFuLWVuYWJsZS1vbi1jaGFpbi1jZW5zb3JzaGlwLWJyaWFuLWFybXN0cm9uZw/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baB1924b4e9)  like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken to be in this business: They are  holding on to people’s Ether for them anyway, and they have a big  economic interest in Ether working well, so they might as well stake  customers’ coins, validate transactions, and share the staking rewards  with their customers.

The economic model here is a bit different  from the Bitcoin proof-of-work model. In that model, professional miners  basically buy electricity and turn it into Bitcoins. In this model,  professional stakers, or their customers, basically buy Ether and turn  it into more Ether. You take your Ether, you lock it up in an account at  a financial services firm for a while, and your Ether grows by some  steady percentage. You know: like interest. Kharif and Pan write:

&gt;But for investors, the advantage is that  Ether post-Merge will resemble more of a traditional financial asset  that pays interest, like a bond or a certificate of deposit. That could  entice hedge funds, asset managers, and wealthy individuals who’ve  stayed on the crypto sidelines so far. …To acolytes, staked Ether becomes like shares  of stock that generate dividends or bonds that pay a yield. Ether’s  yield could be relatively attractive: Owners who stake their coins can  get about 4% now, and that’s expected to rise post-Merge. As much as 80%  of all Ether supply— about $170 billion at current prices—could  eventually be staked, according to ConsenSys, an Ethereum blockchain  technology provider. “I think that Ethereum’s merge fundamentally  changes the asset,” says Jack Neureuter, research analyst at Fidelity  Digital Assets, a unit of Fidelity Investments Inc. that plans to offer  custody and trading in Ether later this year. “It fundamentally changes  the investment case around it.” …Still, for existing Ether investors, staked  coins will be similar to putting money to work instead of stuffing it  under a mattress. The yield feature allows traditional finance  professionals who’ve long struggled with valuing crypto assets to  perform cash-flow analyses to compare Ether’s performance with that of  traditional assets. They can also benchmark staked Ether against other  investments. “It’s not risk-free, but it gets you close,” says Henry  Elder, head of decentralized finance at Wave Financial Group, an  investment manager. “This is something that crypto really struggled  with: How do you compare asset managers, how do you compare performance?  I think that’s super important, because when you get to institutional  investors, that’s the language that they speak.”

In one sense, crypto is in the business of  constantly reinventing or rediscovering the basic ideas of financial  history, and it is funny for crypto to reinvent *interest*. In  another sense this is cool: Crypto has rediscovered interest from  entirely different principles. In traditional finance, you get interest  on your money because you are lending it to someone else to build some  productive business. In crypto, you get interest on your money because  you are getting paid for maintaining the ledger. \[3\]

A few notes. First, we talked a lot a few  years ago about Bitcoin futures. The idea of a Bitcoin futures contract  is that you get economic exposure to the price of Bitcoin without  actually holding a Bitcoin: For every dollar that the price of Bitcoin  goes up, you get paid $1 on your futures contract. \[4\]  When Bitcoin futures contracts launched on traditional exchanges in  2017, the futures traded at a large premium to Bitcoin itself: People  might pay $18,000 for a Bitcoin but $18,500 for a Bitcoin future. I [  explained this](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTctMTItMTkvYml0Y29pbi1mdXR1cmVzLWFyZS1hLWdyZWF0LXdheS10by1ub3Qtb3duLWJpdGNvaW4_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDkxNDIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwOTE0JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baBf77110ab) by saying that, for a lot of traditional institutional investors, it was *much* more  pleasant to hold a futures contract on a regulated exchange than it is  to hold a Bitcoin. If you own a Bitcoin, you’ll probably lose your  private keys or get hacked or something; your compliance department and  regulators won’t know what to make of it. If you own a futures contract  on an exchange, that’s fine, that’s a normal thing, your systems and  lawyers and regulators know how to handle that. So traditional investors  who wanted to get into Bitcoin would buy futures, and more nimble hedge  funds would sell them the futures and buy Bitcoin to hedge, and the  hedge funds would get paid a premium because they were doing valuable  work.

This effect has reduced over time, as  institutions have gotten more comfortable and efficient about owning  crypto. And with staking it reverses. If you own actual Ethereum, you  can stake it and earn interest. If you own [ Ethereum futures](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9tYWNyb2NlcGhhbG9wb2Qvc3RhdHVzLzE1NjkzNzkxOTM0MzA4NzYxNjY/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baB37225aac),  you miss out on the interest. So spot Ethereum should be worth more  than futures, and futures for near-term delivery should be worth more  than futures for later delivery. Ethereum should be in [ backwardation](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbC1nYW1tYS5jb20vX2ZpbGVzL3VnZC9hZGM0ZTFfMjllNDFkZmQzZTg5NGQyMWEyYzg1OGFiMjA3ZmZiNTcucGRm/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baB5b9a5981)  rather than contango: The forward price should decline over time,  because owning Ether now (and getting interest) is more valuable than  owning it later (and missing out). If you are a hedge fund buying spot  Ether and selling Ether futures to institutions, now you should pay  them.

Second, I said above that it is natural for  big centralized crypto exchanges to be Ethereum stakers: They are  keeping track of customer money anyway, they care about the ecosystem,  they have rails to pay staking rewards to customers, etc. But the  exchanges have other incentives: They tend to be big regulated companies  located in financial centers; their executives tend to be rich and want  to stay that way and avoid prison. They are thus convenient subjects of  regulation. Some people in crypto worry that letting them be in charge  of confirming Ethereum transactions will mean that the Ethereum ledger  itself becomes too subject to regulation. At the Financial Times, [ Scott Chipolina reports](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvODg1MThiYzUtM2FmNC00MWMzLTk5YjUtYzBjZDBiYTY5YWI5/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baBfd8959e6):

&gt;This problem has become clearer since the US  Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) last month imposed  sanctions against Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based platform that the  government accused of facilitating billions-worth of laundered crypto.  The staunchest of crypto’s libertarian army had said the heavy hand of  government would prove ineffective against the kinds of “smart  contracts” — computer software designed to automate transactions — that  run on decentralised platforms. Yet, sanctions have proved effective  after all. In the weeks since Tornado Cash was targeted, transactions on  the platform nosedived.That worry is bound to cross the minds of  Ethereum’s future guardians, including exchanges Binance and Coinbase,  and staking platform Lido Finance. According to Nansen data, these  companies are already some of the biggest Ethereum staking players  around, and thus will be trusted to secure the network post-Merge. Last  month, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said his exchange would  likely quit the staking business before censoring the network.As guardians of the Ethereum network, these  entities will have to decide whether or not to validate and process  blocks of transactions that may contain transactions coming from  entities under sanctions such as Tornado Cash. That hardly sounds like  the censorship-resistant utopia envisioned by the idealists — although  critics of bitcoin point out that the concentration of miners (who are  overwhelmingly based in certain countries such as the US and Russia) in  that blockchain also amounts to a centralised system.

The idea is that if Coinbase and Binance are  confirming all of the Ethereum transactions, and the US Treasury goes to  them and says “hey don’t confirm any Ethereum transactions from the  following list of Russian-affiliated addresses,” they’ll do what  Treasury says rather than risking unpleasantness with the US government.  And so the Ethereum blockchain will become a policy arm of the US  government (or other governments with power over stakers), like the  dollar financial system is. I am not so sure about this worry: As  Chipolina notes, Bitcoin mining is also pretty concentrated, including  in US public companies, and I suppose that the Treasury could lean on  Bitcoin miners to exclude Russian transactions too. But, sure.  Centralization exposes crypto to more effective regulation; if a million  anonymous users confirm transactions then they’re hard to censor, but  if six big exchanges confirm transactions then those exchanges will want  to stay on the good side of regulators.

I suppose one more point is that if you are a big *US*\-based  crypto exchange and you are paying staking rewards on Ethereum, does  that make your offering a security that needs to be registered under US  Securities and Exchange Commission rules? An interest-paying crypto  lending product is probably a security, the SEC [  said last year](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDktMDgvbGVuZGluZy1iaXRjb2lucy1pcy10cmlja3k_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDkxNDIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwOTE0JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baB82b81f11), and while it is [  not exactly rushing to clarify](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDktMTMvY3J5cHRvLXdhbnRzLXNvbWUtc2VjLXJ1bGVzP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA5MTQyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDkxNCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baC9f3b11b5)  the situation for staking, you might worry. “There is regulatory  uncertainty regarding the status of our staking, lending, rewards, and  other yield-generating activities under the U.S. federal and state  securities laws,” [ says Coinbase Global Inc.](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29049995.256953/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9peD9kb2M9L0FyY2hpdmVzL2VkZ2FyL2RhdGEvMTY3OTc4OC8wMDAxNjc5Nzg4MjIwMDAwODUvY29pbi0yMDIyMDYzMC5odG0/60dcb0d9dfa1d82d3152e9baBc8c17771) in its SEC filings, and with the Merge that might be a bigger risk.

When I signed up for the 401k the max allowed contribution was only 30%. Since 3/4 of the year is already over I will not get close to the federal contribution limit.

stocks,"Mohnish Pabrai bought 5% of TAV Airports(Turkish Company), here's the DD of the business.","Mohnish Pabrai invested in another Turkish Company, considering his last investment in Reysaş (another Turkish Company) returned him over 4-5X on dollar basis, I think his new investment at TAV Airports is worth taking a look at.

[https://imgur.com/cJEYLjK](https://imgur.com/cJEYLjK)

As we can see in the document above, he invested additional 357000₺ to Tav Airports which brought his ownership in the company above 5% threshold for declaring ownership to KAP for the public to see.(similar to SEC In Turkey but not exactly, exact match is SPK in this case)

He bought his additional shares on 14th of July with an average share price of just under 50 liras. The stock is currently trading at around 65 liras which means that if you want to invest now you have to pay around %30 premium than what Mohnish has paid.

TAV Airports constructs terminal buildings, and manages and operates terminals or airports in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Macedonia, Latvia, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Spain, and internationally. It operates through Terminal Operations, Catering Operations, Duty Free Operations, Ground Handling and Bus Operations, and Other segments. So almost everything that *AIRLINES* don’t do, It's TAV Airports that’s doing it. Before going further on their business let's take a look at their ownership:

[https://imgur.com/RWs1PTO](https://imgur.com/RWs1PTO)

Free float on Turkish Stock Market is at 47.6%, Groupe ADP owns the most shares with 46.1% and 6.3% of the company is owned by two Turkish construction firms. Of course now we know Mohnish owns over 5% of that free float as well.

TAV Airports operates 15 airports in 8 countries (this is just Airports, not other services.)

[https://imgur.com/Fnsb8Ae](https://imgur.com/Fnsb8Ae)

Here is a map that shows the areas TAV Airports operate at. Looking at the map, I would consider an investment at TAV Airports is a bet on developing countries, which reminds me of a famous Charlie Munger quote “The first rule of fishing is fish where the fish are”. But TAV Airports in my opinion is also a value play which I will talk about later in the article.

TAV Airports are growing in mainly two ways;

\-They buy the rights to operate new Airports

\-They increase the revenue per Airport YoY

Of course their service business is also growing but that’s not where most of the company's revenue is coming from. Here is how they show their growth path in 2021 Annual Report:

[https://imgur.com/a/fQXXJWy](https://imgur.com/a/fQXXJWy)

TAV Airports don’t actually own the Airports they operate in, they buy the rights to operate for a certain time and they accomplished a lot in that area in the past several years.

Airports have strategic importance for countries and just like having two railroads in the same route doesn’t make sense as infrastructure airports are the same as well. Turkey made a new Airport in Istanbul in 2018 and since TAV had the rights to operate the old Airport at the same side of the city, Turkish Government made payments to subsidize TAV’s lost revenue according to their contract. Airports are therefore comparable to train businesses that own the right to operate on important routes, in my opinion and that gives a moat around TAV Airports, and the airports that TAV is authorized to operate are crucial ones, in my opinion. Antalya Airport for example is the busiest airport in mediterranean.

[https://imgur.com/G0cTSuF](https://imgur.com/G0cTSuF)

Here we have a chart that shows TAV’s concessions and fare structure at the airports. TAV is a Turkish based company and as we all know Lira is losing its value and has a very high inflation. TAV Airports, even though they are a Turkish based company has their revenues in mostly USD and EURO, Mohnish has talked about how he looks for companies with EURO and USD revenue stream in Turkey before so I think that’s one thing about TAV Airports he finds very attractive, TAV’s income stream is in Euro and USD but their costs (especially labor cost) are mostly in Lira which means as Turkish Lira losing value (will probably keep losing value because of the low interest rate policy combined with very high inflation) TAV’s net income is increasing.

As I stated before, TAV Airports have made very important achievements on their Airports concession duration. From their last annual report “**After winning the Antalya Airport tender, the EBITDA weighted average concession duration of our portfolio increased from eight years in 2020 to 30 years.**“ I would consider this new duration has widened their moat significantly.

In 2021, TAV Airports acquired Almaty Airport. I'm just going to include that section in its entirety here because I believe they did a fantastic job of outlining its significance in their annual report.

[https://imgur.com/3BUB9tD](https://imgur.com/3BUB9tD)

The fact that Almaty generated a net profit in 2020 is crucial in my opinion because it demonstrates how resilient the airport is.

Now, let’s start looking at their financials.

[https://imgur.com/a/NEYRHCG](https://imgur.com/a/NEYRHCG)

Here we have the income statement, obviously the effect of covid-19 is clearly visible in 2020 and 2021. Company’s current market cap is 23.82B Liras in other words 1.30B€, assuming they return to around 2019 levels next year (they now have Almaty as well which company describes as one of its flagships but on the other hand in 2019 they had a huge amount in total extraordinary items which is not a trustworthy recurring income) with 300M€, their P/E would be around 4 (currently 30).

[https://imgur.com/YQKDkGk](https://imgur.com/YQKDkGk)

Here we have the company’s 1H22 results. Revenue and EBITDA are up huge mostly because of Almaty acquisition and recovery from covid.

And now let’s look at their revenue and OPEX (operating expense) breakdowns (inner circle is 1H2021, outer circle is 1H2022),

Couple of things I wanna point out in my opinion very important are

● Their revenue stream is well diversified and since their margins are not directly connected to the price of oil like airlines companies and assuming covid to be a black swan event I think their revenues are both well diversified and sustainable (especially now their average concession duration is 30 years)

● As I stated above a significant cost is labor and Turkish Lira’s devaluation means higher margins for the company.

[https://imgur.com/a/3EuO5dc](https://imgur.com/a/3EuO5dc)

And here is a breakdown of their EBITDA by airports (Havas includes Antalya)

[https://imgur.com/a/678IraJ](https://imgur.com/a/678IraJ)

TAV Airports generally likes to reward their shareholders with dividend distributions. Most Turkish companies don’t do share repurchases as far as I can see.

[https://imgur.com/a/hbymjZo](https://imgur.com/a/hbymjZo)

As we can see in their 1H22 report, they have stopped the dividend payments since Covid but remain determined to return it and their dividend payments in euro basis was trending upwards. So, in my opinion, that's a relief for foreign investors.

Now let’s take a look at the risks of investing in this company:

\- Turkey’s current economic situation: In modern history of Turkey(now Turkiye), the country never defaulted on its debt but current inflation is over 80% and Lira has lost over 80% of its value against USD in the last 5 years. Turkey accounts for an underwhelming majority of TAV's business, and even though they are hedged with most of their contracts being in USD and EURO, a sudden stop in Turkish Economy would probably mean less business for airports.

\- Margin Problems in the short term: TAV’s margins have shrunk significantly since Covid and if they can’t recover their margins soon enough the multiples market is currently giving to the company could shrink (TTM P/E is 30 as I write this). In 2017 and 2018 they had around 44% ebitda margins, 37.4% for 2019 7.5% for 2020 and 28.6% for 2021.

\- Slower economic growth for developing countries: As I previously indicated using Turkey as an example, nearly all of TAV's business is in developing nations, emerging nations would suffer far more than wealthy nations from a global economic downturn or possibly stagflation.

\- DEBT, in their 1H22 report, the company once again did a fantastic job of outlining the fundamentals of their debt issue. I'll put that page here.

[https://imgur.com/a/jtoTAo5](https://imgur.com/a/jtoTAo5)

Even with their strong 2019 EBITDA, they have a Net Debt/EBITDA of 5.9, I find that to be high but in the same time period the company managed to get Almaty Airport and their concession duration went from 8 to 30 on average. So the debt part of the company depends on what you think of management’s capital allocation progress, in my opinion.

So to summarize

● TAV Airports have a huge moat around their business and they managed to expand it even further in the last several years while also increasing the amount of debt they had. (I want to point out that as long as the expected return is higher than the cost of capital, debt is a fine way to grow the business for me.)

● TAV Airports likes to do dividend distributions to reward shareholders and before the pandemic their dividend payments in euro basis were going up and they also point out that they are still determined to return the dividend and make it %50 of their IFRS Net Profit (IFRS Net Profit means after tax profit to be determined pursuant to consolidated financial).

● There is not an overvaluation of the company in my opinion and as long as they manage to return to their pre-pandemic levels (very strong signs they will even pass it in the coming year) your downside is protected.

● TAV Airports is a Turkey based company and is highly exposed to developing countries. In my judgment, such a business model poses greater structural risk than the typical S&amp;P 500 corporation. TAV Airports does not carry a net cash position as well, they leverage their business through debt, which could be problematic for the company during a crisis (financial crisis or any unexpected event)

I see a lot of posts that say ""the Fed can't hike rates above 5% because then the US won't be able to afford to pay the interest on the $30t it holds in national debt"" as if the millisecond the interest rate changes, it backdates to all of the debt we've collected over the past years. I don't think that's how it works. I believe the overall national debt was financed at various rates over many years, and the current 2022-2023 ""high"" 4-6% interest rates would apply to any new debt issued during that timeframe (which we are running at a rate of about $1t a year as of https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/national-deficit/ unless I'm reading it wrong)

stocks,"Balance Sheet is $9,000,000,000,000 and Fractional Reserve Banking Has Ended","Obviously there has been a lot of talk about the Federal Funds Rate decisions and Quantitative Tightening/Easing, but it's been troubling why more people aren't talking about the Fed balance sheet.  

Back in 2008 when Bernake/Paulsen agreed on terms and congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act it was agreed that the Fed would buy $700b in mortgage back securities from the banks which led to the Act being nicknamed the ""bank bailout of 2008.""  

Also at the time it was said (by everyone) that eventually those emergency policies would need to be rolled back. FOMC member Charles Evans said ""once the economy recovers and financial conditions stabilize, the Fed will reduce the size of the balance sheet.""  

Since then, not only was the balance sheet not reduced, the total has ballooned to $9 trillion (43% of GDP). And in 2016 Bernake himself wrote a paper completely changing the original opinion and saying that they would just grow the balance sheet infinitely:  
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/09/02/should-the-fed-keep-its-balance-sheet-large/  

Obviously people can see the issue here, what was once considered a $700 billion bank bailout has quietly become a $9,000,000,000,000 balance sheet and the S&amp;P 500 has been directly 1:1 correlated with the growth of this ""balance sheet"" amount:  
https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/posts/2021/07/Fed-Balance-Sheet-vs-SP500.php  

Also at the height of Covid in March 2020 the Fed decided to abandon factional reserve banking completely, setting the reserve requirements to 0:  
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm  

So now that we are seeing persistent and extreme inflation isn't this absolutely a case of taxation without representation?  The banks have given themselves $9,000,000,000,000 which required no congressional action and now people are paying for it in the form of higher prices on goods, services, housing, transportation, and energy etc.  

Why aren't more people talking about this, when TARP passed in 2008 it was headline news.
  
  
-———————————————————————  
EDIT: 
Seems like some people are noticing a conflation of TARP and the balance sheet so wanted to clarify.  Both TARP and Quantitative Easing were initiated at the same time at the end of 2008.  TARP was the fiscal policy (by congress/the Treasury) and Quantitative Easing was the monetary policy (by the Fed buying MBS).  

While TARP ended, Quantitative Easing continued and has since ballooned on the Fed balance sheet to $9 trillion dollars. It was initially thought that normalization (balance sheet run off) would occur but that hasn't happened. And Bernake's paper linked above as well as a book he released in May of this year (21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19) suggests that the balance sheet will never be normalized.  Money on the Fed balance sheet went into bank reserves and when combined with lowering reserve requirements seems like a never ending infinite bank bailout.",finance,1663204027
personalfinance,Lender declined to extend rate lock - do I have any options?,"Due to continuing delays from my homebuilder, my lender has refused to extend my rate lock, and as a result, I'll be stuck with a mortgage payment well beyond what I can afford. 

First, some background information. I originally put down a 5% deposit on a townhome back in Summer 2021, with the expectation from the builder that the home would be finished by April 2022. I managed to lock in a great rate in October **at 3.15%**. Around January, the builder reached out to me saying that they were behind schedule, and the completion date was now July. I let my lender know, and they agreed to extend the rate lock through October 2022, just to be safe. I was already get worried, as rates at this point were **over 4%,** but was fortunate to able to lock it in. Back in July, I hear back from the builder again - surprise - it's delayed further, now the completion date is November 2022. Again, I go back to the lender and request another rate lock extension, this time to the end of the year. All the while I am hemorrhaging money trying to extend the rate lock, because by this point rates are **over 6%.** 

Last week, I again heard from the builder. Completion date is now February 2023, nearly **10 whole fucking months** later than the original completion date. I reached out to my lender, and they said they would not continue extending the rate lock into 2023. Instead I would have to accept a new, market-based rate, which at this time is **7.05%.** What started as a very affordable mortgage payment when I started this process has now more than doubled, and would be well beyond what I can comfortably afford. 

So, to put it bluntly, am I completely screwed here? The builder has bent me over time and time again over the course of a year, and now the lender won't continue a rate lock, and there is no way I can afford the mortgage payment at a **&gt;7% interest rate**.

The house price around this area is crazy, and I don't think I can afford one any time soon given my savings. I can work remotely so I'm thinking about moving to another state, preferably with lower state income tax and more reasonable house price, which will allow me to afford a house.

Forex,The majority of this sub is hopelessly lost due to SMC.,"ICT and copycats alike have infected retail forex. Its nothing new really, and it used to run under a different name, but people need to understand that marketers like ICT do not have your best interest in mind. They only exist to sell you a prospect.  
ICT has been caught numerous times trading demos when he is supposed to be trading real money. He has been called out for huge losses and brushed them off as ""Oh I was just testing the market, those losses don't count."" Do you realize how ridiculous he sounds? He's a snakeoil salesman. He rambles on and on. Anytime his logic starts to show cracks he just adds another layer of reasoning to discontinue the current train of reasoning. ""Oh, this zone failed because its actually part of a much bigger retracement, the market makers want to trick you with this one. (5 minutes later the zone validates itself again) ""Oh this is actually a classic reverse blah blah blah seen its a thousand times."" Its a constant layer of BS and contradictions. There is no organized reasoning, it constantly changes to validate him.  
The concept of SMC itself is fundamentally flawed. If you cannot quantify aspects to your reasoning in trading then they only exist as arbitrary vague. I have found no SMC trader who can tell me anything specific about an order block. ""There is liquidity above this order block."" Ok, roughly how much money sits there? No one can answer that. I get that retail traders do not have access to the back-end of the banking, but then how can you base your position off of it. How about assigning it a relative value. Compare X order block to Y order block. Which one has more liquidity surrounding it? Out of every 1000 demand zones that appear on X pair, how many of them fail? Its not possible to say because the definition is too vague. I could ask 100 SMC traders to draw supply and demand zones on a chart and there will be a large array of results. How exactly do you supposedly back test something that you can't define in the first place.  
It needs to be understood that Forex especially in the short term is very random for the same reason the price of oil can be random. Not everyone buying a barrel of oil plans on speculating its future value. They need oil because its a commodity. Currencies work the same way. Sometimes people need a specific currency regardless of its price outlook. Its going to be impossible to predict a lot of short term movements because of that. You will have people who trade short terms movements and do well, however you also have people who play craps and do very well. It doesn't always mean you are playing a winning game just because you happen to be winning.  
I am going to shill macros once again and I always will because they are the only predictable driving force of currency markets. I can tell you exactly the average range of a specific news release. You can go back in time and see the sheer affects of interest rates/PPI/Bond Auctions/Job data ect month over month and year over year. Sure the market deviates but it will always gravitate back to what the macro data is.  
You are being sold something under the guise that its unique and special, but scroll through this sub. SMC and technicals in general are what 99 percent of people use. Every CPI release you can scroll through this sub and it will be chalk full of people panicking because there pair is way more volatile than what they thought they signed up for. Its embarrassing when you claim to be an expert trader after making some money for a couple months and continue to give ICT and alikes your voucher but you can't fathom why high CPI would strengthen a currency. Therefore you claim trading news is another market maker ploy. No, the market isn't going move hundreds of millions of dollars to collect your micro lots that don't even exist outside of the bucketshop CFD provider you ""trade"" with.",finance,1663216463

Forex,What does higher interest rates mean for the FX markets?,"Unless you've been living under a rock, you'll know that high inflation and interest rate hikes are driving the markets and being reported frequently on the news.

With the rate hikes not easing in the near future, what could this mean for the Forex and other markets? What trading opportunities could this present... 

**Recession** \- higher interest rates may lead to recession. Central banks may actually see recession as one of the only options to cool down inflation. 

Higher rates discourage spending and encourage saving and paying off debt - economies can thrive when people spend, spend, spend - the less people borrow and spend, the greater the chance of recession. 

**Housing** \- with higher interest rates comes higher mortgage rates, so it's more expensive to own a home and to buy-to-let. 

Due to historically low interest rates for more than a decade (some countries even longer), many homeowners and landlords haven't experienced (or have forgotten) how costly interest rate hikes are. As an example, a mortgage of £250,000/$250,000 has a monthly repayment increase of around £140/$140 for every 1% rise in rates (on a 25 year mortgage). If interest rates were to increase to say 5%, which is realistic, homeowners and landlords could be paying about £600/$600 a month more than they were paying a couple of years ago... Combine this with drastically rising energy rates and you have a whirlpool of disaster... 

What does this mean? Higher rents to cover landlord mortgage repayments and higher mortgage repayments for homeowners, leading to less money to spend and less houses being bought.

**So, what does this mean for FX and other markets?**

**Well, if the current rate hikes don't bring down inflation and further rate hikes are expected...**  

*Stock markets* \- it might not be time to buy the dip. Prices could yet fall further. 

*FX* \- possibly a weaker GBP, EUR and CAD. Below parity on EURUSD and perhaps parity (or near parity) for GBPUSD. Potentially an even stronger USD and CHF. Countries that are not being as impacted by high inflation and rising rates could also see strength, such as CNH, AUD and NZD. If the BOJ can stabilise the Yen, then JPY could also see strength.

*Commodities* \- possible upside on GOLD, SILVER and commodities in general.  

**If the current rate hikes start to bring down inflation...** 

*Stock markets* \- we could already have the lows and start to see upside in the coming weeks and months

*FX* \- currencies against the USD may have a floor and we could see USD pairs retrace. 

*Commodities* \- possible further downside on GOLD, SILVER and commodities in general.  We could see GOLD break below it's current weekly range.",finance,1663225970
personalfinance,Buying a condo or renting an apartment?,"I’m finishing my last semester of undergrad and have accepted a job offer in Dallas, TX. Base salary will be 90-95k with a 15k signing bonus (which I have access to immediately) and a 10-20% annual performance bonus. I also have about 45k in an investment account and 10k in savings. My credit is very good (750+). I will move to Dallas in about 4 months and I’m considering buying a condo rather than renting an apartment. 

Assuming I were to move somewhere close to my future office, I would probably be looking at 275-300k for a 1BR condo (Average HOA fees, just from what I can find online can be anything from 200 to 700 per month) whereas rent would likely be 1700-2000 per month.

I expect to stay at this job for 3-5 years before probably going back to grad school. Hard to say where I’ll go from there but definitely could be back to Dallas. 

I would probably have to cash out a significant portion of my investment account to make a ~20% down payment should I decide to buy but I really don’t mind as I am not very confident in my ability to invest in the current market.

I definitely like the idea of buying over renting and building equity in a property by making similar monthly payments to what rent would cost anyway. However, I certainly understand there are several nuances to this sort of decision. I’m curious of anyone’s opinion on how the timing associated with the current housing market and interest rate climate should affect my decision making, and I would appreciate any feedback about the overall feasibility of the buy route and any further advice to help make a final decision.",finance,1663227172
personalfinance,I believe I've been scammed by a bank executive into a loan I can't pay and it's going to ruin my life (MX)...,"TL/DR I was pushed by a bank executive into accepting a big loan to pay off my smaller (yet, virtually more expensive) loan under a premise that, upon checking out how loans work, might be false. If what I learnt is true, not only my credit score will plummet, I'm also going to lose everything. Advice needed in how to approach to the bank... or any other advice, please.


Reddit I'm somewhere between shocked, in total dispair and with just a tad of hope that this is just a misunderstanding. Between that and the fact that I'm not a native English speaker, I apologise for any grammar mistakes. I'll do my best to explain the situation... 

I'm very organized and I pay my credits right on time but I don't have chance to save money so any unexpected expense takes a toll on my. Early this year (February) three incidentals happened, so I took a loan (5,000 USD), which was crazy expensive (\~200 USD + taxes included/48 months) but there wasn't any penalization for early payments, so I was planning on paying it in about 24-30 months as soon as everything got back in track. It was my first loan ever, but there was no other option.

Saddly, sh\*t kept happening and last week I was struggling while planning my next 12 month finances, prices are sky rocketing, I lost one of my income sources (125/m),  and the whole year has been a financial mess. I haven't been able to increase my monthly payments, the interest rate is eating off all my payments (no penalizations whatsoever, just the interes+tax). So far my debt still is 4450. But from August next year I will be able to pay 400-600 dlls / monthly which will reduce significantly the time. 

Out of the blue, I got a call this week from my bank asking me to go meet them because they were lowering their rates in loans... So, I went on Wednesday and the bank executive told me I was being offered a 17,000 USD loan for half the interest rate (payments of 640 monthly/48m), I could also take a lower amount If I wanted but the interest rate wouldn't be as low. 

I said I wasn't interested in taking that amount of money because I was already focused in paying the one. He said the decrease on the rate was a present to their clients with good financial score, such as myself, so I just needed to say yes and my monthly payments will be down to 180USD/48 months. In my current situation, 20 dlls less per month are happily received because those are 20 extras for the loan, shortening its time.

I asked everything that came to mind, and long story short, he told me I had to take the 17,000 but they were going to transfer only 12,450, therefore eliminating my previous loan. Then I would have to wait 1 month and pay the 12,450 as an early payment. That would leave me with my original 4550 to pay. I then told him I don't have the 640usd for that first month, I could only pay the normal 200 and he said: ""no problem, you take those 440 from the early payment which will leave you with your original 5,000 debt, but with such a lower interest rate. This month they are going to charge you only half the interest from the first loan and half the interest from the big loan, so is not going to be 640. Also, because you paid earlier the first loan, they are going to give you back the insurance you paid at the begining, so there's a chance you won't have the original 5,000 debt but about 4600"". 

Still hesitating I remarked that I can't pay more than $200 per month and I was only considering it for the 20dlls less. So he gave me a speech about how much money (from the bonus he gets) he would lose if his clients couldn't pay and why both the bank and him are very careful to whom they offer this loans. I ended up accepting it, the transfer was immediate and everything checked out just fine.

Back home, I was recalculating my annual plan and I happened to find a loan simulator from another bank. I happily tried it and it crushed my soul...in that simulator, even If I pay ahead the 12,450 the monthly payments won't be smaller. It will shorten the time though, but the thing is, once again, I can't pay to the loan more than 200 per month. If I don't pay the 640 not only the interest are going to increase, after a couple of months they could take my home.

I can't cut any of my expenses (200 for food, 270 for housing and utilities, 610 for credit/taxes/legal matters, 200 loan). I'm on the process of putting into my name the apartment I inherited which wasn't debt free (the loan was to pay part of that debt off) those are the unavoidable credit/taxes/legal and the reason I can't pay the loan ahead. Can't rent it out because I already have 2 roomates, can't put a mortage on it because 1) still not legally mine 2) is almost 50 years old.

So either the bank takes my home, or the state, or the notary... I'm freaking out...

Any advice on how to approach to the bank in the next few hours??

UPDATE: 

I went to the branch and they said they couldn't check it out from there, it had to be done over the phone. So, I called and they told me almost all the info was right except that I shouldn't wait a month to transfer back to them the amount I won't be using, it can be done today. They entered a petition to put that amount on the capital to reduce the monthly payments. The gave me the number of that petition and the bank is supposed to give me an answer in 15 days. 

Only problem: the app isn't working so I can't transfer the money. I'll try again later.",finance,1663227717
investing,Americans keep running up credit card debt even as interest rates climb. When will this go wrong?,"So read an article [here on yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-card-debt-interest-rates-174011574.html) saying that with inflation making everything more expensive, instead of Americans holding off certain purchases they keep buying by instead running up their credit card debt like crazy.

Now my question.. when do you see this consumer credit bubble collapse? I mean it seems in the US people can just keep piling up debt, opening new credit lines, so anybody can put a timeframe on when something like this will go wrong maybe based on how this went historically? Or can this really keep going for a long time before anything happens?

I live in Europe and over here you get rejected alot faster while in the US it seems credit card companies don't care giving away more or new credit thinking worst case they can be bailed out again.",finance,1663227781

# [Stock futures are little changed ahead of a fresh batch of economic data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. equity futures were little changed on Thursday as investors looked ahead to several economic reports scheduled to come out in the morning.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 12 points, or less than 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Retail sales, import prices and jobless claims, as well as the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey and the Empire State manufacturing survey are all slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Those reports will come after Wednesday’s producer price index report showed an decrease in wholesale prices of 0.1% in August.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a choppy session in which the major averages posted modest gains. The Dow on Wednesday closed slightly higher, by 30 points, after falling more than 200 points at one point. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Stocks sought stability after a hotter-than-expected inflation report on Tuesday sent them tumbling to post their worst day since 2020. August’s consumer price index report showed headline inflation rose 0.1% on a monthly basis, despite a drop in gas prices.
*****
&gt; “One-day events are tough to extrapolate,” said Jeff deGraaf, founder and chairman of Renaissance Macro Research, on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “It is one of those extreme events that doesn’t have follow-through and that tends to be good news, not bad.”
*****
&gt; “Inflation is really a dark cloud over equities, but I think it’s really important that people keep in mind that it’s not about good and bad in the markets, it’s about better and worse,” he added, “and it does appear that inflation is getting better.”

N_E_W_S,How inflation is fueling a nationwide labor movement,"&gt;Labor initiatives are surging throughout the U.S. economy, driven by a higher cost of living that’s proving resistant to interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Inflation numbers for August came in hotter than expected this week despite falling gas prices. Core inflation climbed 0.6 percent on the month, doubling what economists anticipated.   
&gt;  
&gt;Both Republicans and Democrats have bemoaned the fact that persistently high inflation eats into paychecks and effectively decreases wages, which have barely seen an increase in 40 years.

personalfinance,HELOC Loan converted to fixed rate,"Alright reddit finance fam, I need some feedback. 

We have about $200k equity in our home. I would like to take out a HELOC for $70k and use this to finance a property purchase closer to our parents. My research shows that a portion of HELOCs can be converted to fixed rates, although slightly higher than variable. With interest rates climbing I'd like to take the HELOC, use $50k to purchase the property, and immediatley convert to a fixed rate. I'd like to use the remaining to pay the mortgage until May of 2023. 

&amp;#x200B;

We plan to sell our current house in the spring and I'd like to pay off the Heloc to a zero balance at that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will this work? What am I not considering? Most HELOCs are 10/20/30 years so I realize I need to look for a bank or CU with no/low early termination fees. Or should i zero it out and leave it open (look into inactivity fees).. Is there a better way you suggest to go about this? Would appreicate any insight!",finance,1663244995

personalfinance,Current emergency fund is a 1 year CD ladder. Should I move it to a savings account?,"For a several year period before we had kids, our monthly expenses were low. We both had decent paying jobs. We had no debt (we were renting and no car loan) so we fairly aggressively saved up two emergency funds. One to act as income replacement in the event one or both of us lost our jobs and one to act as a fund for unexpected things.

The income replacement fund is structured as 12 1-year CDs that renew at the beginning of the month. The idea was, at the time, that if we needed it we would just set it to deposit into the checking account at maturity instead of auto-renewing. A 1 year CD also tends to have a higher interest rate than a high yield savings account. We saved enough so that we could put $2000 into each CD. That's been a few years ago now and because of interest, each one is between $2200 - $2300. So lets just say $2250 as an average.

However, since then we've bought a house. My wife is a stay at home mom. I have a car loan. The financial situation has greatly changed and that $2250 in each CD would not cover our monthly expenses (even after the car loan is paid off). I also don't make enough extra to where we could afford to set some aside each month to boost each CD as it matures. I've been using YNAB for a few months now and it's made we hyper aware of all my ""true expenses"" and after budgeting for them, we don't have a lot left over.

After typing this out, I feel like I know the answer, but I'm curious what y'alls opinions will be.

EDIT: ITT people not understanding a CD ladder. I don't have to wait a year to access the money. Each CD expires at the beginning of the month so I could just redirect it into checking and it would be like a paycheck. I have a more liquid emergency fund in savings that is smaller for emergencies where I need it right away. For example, I have a CD maturing on Oct 1st, and another one maturing on Nov 1st, etc.",finance,1663247593

That leads me to speculate  that Fed may have to raise the interest rates to at least 5% which may not be enough to tame the inflation. 

I do not think fed can raise more due to our debt service being approx 15% of our budget but I’d love to hear other arguments. 

Do you think fed wont raise beyond the certain number and let the economy take its course which can take months or a year. Or more. 

Wondering how it can affect stock market if inflation is relatively high and the rates are high as well? 

Happy investing.

I have 50k in the US stock market (ROTH and self directed), match my company's 401k contribution, and have a high 4 figure crypto portfolio. I had a big goal when I was younger of buying my first house ASAP (between the ages of 22-24). I started at this goal last year but was essentially priced out of the housing market. The goal was to do house hacking but I would have to use my stock portfolio to fund the down payment and the closing costs. As interest rates rose, I decided to sit out of the market and see what the housing market does.... while doing that, I did some math to see where my portfolio would be if I earned 9% per year and only contributed 6k per year  and IIRC it came out around $4m. Now it has me wondering is it still worth it to sacrifice my stock portfolio and start from 0 again for a house?

I want to lower my taxable burden such that I am in the lower tax bracket through whatever legal means that I can. If I maxed out the entire Mega Backdoor Roth, would that put me in a significantly lower bracket while also minimally impacting my take home pay?

I was somewhat living off my credit cards while going to school and not working much the past 2 years, plus the unplanned birth of my baby. But fortunately after finishing school I've doubled my income. 

I looked into possibly a debt consolidation loan at the moment, but due to my credit score tanking from 800+ down to about 620 in the past 2 years, the best APR I can get is 9.99% with Est. Monthly payment of about $598 for a loan of about $19,500 to pay off the 2 highest credit card balances. 

I would appreciate any advice you could give me that would save me the most money. I'm willing to put almost all my remaining income each month if it means I'll save the most in the long run. I got myself into this crappy situation, so a little punishment for my mistakes is more than reasonable if it means I have to sacrifice going out, or buying new things and just living as frugally as possible to dig myself out of this hole, and just be done with as quickly as possible. 

Thank you

personalfinance,"How to balance student loans, retirement, and saving for a house?","I am hoping to get some insight on my situation as I've ran the numbers a few times on paper but can't make a decision. I also understand that this decision will be based on what is more important to me (debt-free? Homeowner? Comfy retirement savings?), but I am wondering if someone with more life experience or someone who has been down this road has any advice!

Age: 24  
Annual income: $115k base, closer to $120k after overtime pay  
Cash: $37k (15k emergency fund)  
Student loans: $52k (30k private at 5%, 22k federal at 4%, monthly payment $400 to private)  
Retirement: $71k (39k Roth 401k with 6% company match, 19k Roth IRA, 12k brokerage account)

I still live with my parents so I have no housing costs. The houses I am looking to buy seem to be around the $300k-400k mark, but that is probably over-valued at this time given the housing market conditions.

Currently I am paying the minimum on my student loans, maxing out retirement accounts, contributing an extra $300/month into my brokerage, and then throwing the rest into a high-yield savings account.

Should I continue aggressively saving in my retirement accounts while the stock market is ""down,"" or only contribute 6% to get the company match and build a larger nest egg? And then with that nest egg, should I pay off all my student loans and start from zero saving for a down payment? Part of me feels like I am missing out on time in the market if I slow down my contributions. But another part of me does want to own a house in the next 1-2 years and getting there in that timeframe means saving more cash for a down payment. The other part of me feels like my student loans will come to bite me in the butt if I don't pay them off first before buying a house.

What should I do? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance,1663268538

It's served me well but I'm preparing to scrap it and build a new one,  this time using WireGuard to see if there's a difference in speed but  mainly just to learn about how it works since I've only ever really  worked with L2TP and IPsec.

Now,  this isn't pointless for me entirely because I'm mainly doing it for  hobby/study purposes to better familiarize myself with different VPN  technologies. But lately I've been thinking about the five eyes and if  there's anything they truly \*can't\* see; whether using a VPN for the  chief purpose of preventing your government from spying on your online  habits is pointless for average users.

Can't  intelligence agencies acquire a backdoor into just about anything ? If  your commercial VPN is established in a country within the fourteen  eyes, does it really matter if they claim ""no logs"" ? Isn't there a long  history of big tech companies like Microsoft working with feds to  provide them backdoors ? If they suspect your internet traffic is  interesting enough, what's stopping them from issuing a subpoena to the  VPS provider hosting your VM that your VPN runs off of? What's stopping  the NSA and big cloud providers collaborating on hidden vulnerabilities  for the purpose of mas surveillance ?

Now  obviously, VPNs aren't pointless despite all this. But if you're an  average joe who's only purpose for using a VPN is for privacy from your  government's surveillance, is there really any point ?",technology,1663270713
personalfinance,Discouraged and convinced I’ll never be able to move out of my parents,"Bit of rant. I’m a 26f making 64k per year, which I think is pretty good considering job hopping helped me get here, in 2019 I was making $15/hr. 

I’ve been commuting ~1.5-2.5hrs for about 3 years now, and I’m completely burnt out from that, I have no life because I spend so much of my day sitting in the car. The field I work in is centralized in one region of my state(where I’d like to move). For me to get a job closer I would need to switch fields and take a large paycut. Plus, I really like my job and the city it’s in has many other opportunities as well (which is why I’ve been commuting there for so long). But I’ve only been at this particular job 5 months and this is my 5th job in 4 years so I need to stay there for a little bit at least. 

After taxes/401k/insurance I take home about $2800/month. My car payment/insurance adds up to $600/month, my student loans are $525 for now, once the federal pause is over that’ll be an additional $200 monthly. I have a dog and I’d estimate the cost of that averages to about $150/month considering a yearly visit and restock on flea prevention meds. So that leaves me with $1325 monthly. 

I can’t find anything within a 30 minute radius for less than that (lots of farmland/nothing once you get out of the city so there’s not a ton of options in general), aside from a couple places that are in unsafe neighborhoods that aren’t really an option. The cheapest I could find would probably still add up to about $1500/month including utilities. With that, I’ll end up running out of my $5k savings in just a few months. 

I’m wary of roommates because at this point I’d have to live with a random person, all my friends live with their spouse/partner. Plus my dog has a lot of anxiety issues so it would be better for her if we lived alone so she could have a more structured routine. But do I really have any other option? Where does one find a roommate? I could refinance my student loan to a longer payoff term to reduce my monthly payment, but then I’ll just be paying more over the life of the loan.

Overall I’m just so frustrated that I’m doing everything I can to make this work and it’s just not. I’m so burnt out of driving so much as well.

(Planning for future house and family),"A bit of background: I’m a 26M living in NYC and have procrastinated for an embarrassingly long time on sitting down and planning for my future. Ironically, I work in finance so have had limited time to think these things through. However, I have a vacation coming up and want to spend some time planning.

I have an annual income of \~$200k after-tax (have about $300k invested in stocks, \~2/3 S&amp;P and the rest in tech index funds (obviously this year hurt…).

Recently however, I’ve really been thinking about a family with my current girlfriend (not now, but like \~5 - 10 years in the future), which naturally has led me to think about buying a home and expenses for kids, etc.

The home aspect is really the main thing I’m thinking about right now. I currently live in Hudson Yards Manhattan in a studio, paying \~$3.5k a month, which is obviously really damn high. I understand that buying in the city is not very optimal at the moment given interest rates, but I wonder if buying a condo or something right now would be beneficial for the future when I do buy a house for future family (e.g., rent saved that can be reinvested, appreciation in value, etc.)

For what it’s worth, we hope to eventually settle down in Southern California. My girlfriend is also a banker (though a more junior level so at about half my income).

For over 30 years central banks steadily lowered the price of debt/capital inflating asset prices and disguising and depriving the efficiencies gained by globalisation and technology.

investing,World Bank warns higher rates risk causing global recession,"(Financial Times) -- Organisation calls on central banks to co-ordinate policies and tighten less to avoid ‘devastating’ worldwide downturn

The World Bank has warned that leading central banks risk sending the global economy into a “devastating” recession next year if policymakers raise interest rates too high over the months ahead and stress financial markets.

The Washington-based organisation called on monetary authorities in the big economies to co-ordinate their actions to reduce the overall amount of tightening.

Central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, have embarked on a series of aggressive rate rises over the course of 2022 in a bid to tame inflation that is at, or close to, double figures in several advanced economies for the first time in decades.

Energy and food prices have surged following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, triggering a cost of living crisis.

To avoid letting inflation rip, the World Bank urged governments to provide targeted relief to vulnerable households instead of relying on tighter monetary policy.

David Malpass, president of the World Bank, said momentum in the global economy was sliding and more countries were already falling into recession. “My deep concern is that these trends will persist, with long-lasting consequences that are devastating for people in emerging market and developing economies,” he added.

He called for more action to boost production to ease inflationary pressure, rather than all the focus being on curbing spending. Increased investment would, he said, “improve productivity and capital allocation, which are critical for growth and poverty reduction”.

The World Bank did not produce new forecasts for the global economy, but noted that the outlook for 2023 had been sliding as rich and poor countries alike responded to high inflation this year by seeking to limit spending.

“Central banks around the world have been raising interest rates this year with a degree of synchronicity not seen over the past five decades — a trend that is likely to continue well into next year,” the World Bank said.

The warnings come ahead of crucial policy votes at the Fed and Bank of England next week. The US central bank is expected to raise rates by 75 basis points for the third meeting in a row on Thursday, while UK borrowing costs are likely to rise by 50 basis points.

The expected rises in global interest rates would bear down on inflation, but not enough to meet central banks’ targets, which are usually around 2 per cent, the World Bank warned. Core global inflation, excluding energy, was still likely to be running at a rate of 5 per cent next year — twice the pre-pandemic rate.

If such a level of inflation persuaded central banks to become even more aggressive, global economic growth would drop to 0.5 per cent in 2023, according to the World Bank.

That would meet most definitions of a global recession just three years after the last one, the World Bank added, because with population growth, average global incomes would be falling.

In its modelling(opens a new window), the bank said there needed to be some tightening of monetary policy, but this should be accompanied by every effort to ease bottlenecks both internationally and domestically to allow production to increase without stoking inflation.

This includes boosting the supply of commodities, food and energy to alleviate much of the global inflationary forces, alongside investing to decarbonise economic growth.

The bank’s findings have been echoed by former IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

“Just as central banks, especially those of the richer countries, misread the factors driving inflation when it was rising in 2021, they may also be underestimating the speed with which inflation could fall as their economies slow,” said Obstfeld, urging them to be less “zealous” in raising interest rates.

“By simultaneously all going in the same direction, they risk reinforcing each other’s policy impacts without taking that feedback loop into account,” he added.

stocks,Is there any truth to the idea that as the fed keeps raising interest rates inflation will get worse in the short term?,"The basis being if the fed keeps raising rates in incremental amounts, then servicing the debt for the consumer will get higher. An example for the consumer could be housing, rents and auto loans. The mortgage rates will keep climbing with the fed funds rate, which means mortgage payments for new home buyers will be higher, and it will also push out those who can't buy anymore with the higher rates into renting. This increases demand for rentals also pushing rent prices up.

On the corporate side, higher rates increases their debt servicing cost which may push them to raise prices to keep their margins.

So in between raising rates there's this small gap where the public can still afford to service their debt and the higher rates could lead to higher prices which may be reflected in the CPI. This is of course until rates get so high and defaults start happening.",finance,1663285103

* Inflation is [already decelerating](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-rate-mom), about 1.4% over the last 3 months (core a little more stubborn, but expect housing to come down soon) and that is based on backwards looking CPI data. Once the impacts from the rate increases starts to hit we will see continued deceleration.
* Inflation has been primarily supply driven, Fed can't affect supply with their policies ([see here](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/june/how-much-do-supply-and-demand-drive-inflation/)).
   * Overall, the supply problems have improved over the past year
   * China's zero covid policies are totally unsustainable, look for them to pivot soon
* National debt is [massive](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S), the only way we can serve a debt to gdp ratio this high are low interest rates (which were probably an expectation with the giant covid relief packages). Inflation has basically served as a tax we pay against this debt, which secretly some folks in the government probably haven't minded.
* Mortgage rates are over 6%, rates in the 7-8% range seen unfathomable and would crush the housing market. Some price reductions are a good thing and we're already [seeing housing supply start to build](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/)
* We're already seeing layoffs in high paying industries like tech and banking. We'll see more over the next few months moderating wage growth for high earners
   * Speaking of [wage growth](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker), I don't see a huge problem with inflation hanging around in the 3-5% range a bit longer if we're seeing above average wage growth

investing,The significance of FedEx's Q1 results,"I'm sure many of you have heard that FedEx has massively lowered their Q1 preliminary guidance and withdrew full year forecasts. They pre-announced Q1 EPS of $3.33 vs $5.14 expected. Additionally, the company has begun to close offices to offset a declining volume of packages. That is extreme.

That said, if we look at sales for some names on their latest quarter on a q/q basis, you'd see EBAY (2.5%), HAS +15.1%, and WMT +8%. Sales have not exactly been collapsing here. If sales are okay, how can there be such a drop in package volume?



Ticker	|Q1 Sales|	Q2 Sales|	%Chg
---|---|----|----
EBAY|	$2.48B|	$2.42B|	-2.5%
HAS|	$1.16B|	$1.34B|	+15.1%
WMT|	$141.6B|	$152.9B|	+7.9%

The answer is inflation. If it wasn't clear with Home Depot or Starbuck's recent earnings results, there is massive inflation going on that has allowed for sales to remain drastically elevated despite the decline in volumes. While it was previously unclear if HD or SBUX were isolated events, FedEx's results now show that the effect is very much global. The world is seeing higher sales and lower volume.

These are clear signs of stagflation, however the worst is yet to come. If you look at all the major economies in the world, they generally have two things in common: **high inflation and a hawkish central bank**. The world is combatting inflation in unison and almost all central banks are raising interest rates to quell economic activity. As an example, the US Fed is now expected to raise 75-100bps next week and are guaranteed to continue raising at least until the end of the year.

We are in for a seriously shitty period where we will have to deal with stagflation as central banks are actively trying to put their economies into recession. Inflation is a huge threat. Fixing it will be very painful.

tl;dr Inflation is here. Fixing it will likely require a prolonged recession",finance,1663288473

I've been investing in some more alternative assets over the last couple years. Bought about $60,000 worth of physical gold, silver, and platinum -- locked it up. Bought $60,000 worth of Bitcoin, some of which I have in cold storage, and some more I use to sell covered calls on (I sell covered calls, generate cash, then sell cash-secured puts, which basically allows me to buy free bitcoin every month). 

Recently I put $10,000 into a managed wine investment fund (VinoVest).

I don't own any stocks, but I do actively trade commodity futures. I'm up 85% YTD on my futures account (which translates into generating about $26,000 in profit). 

**Right now I'm sitting on another $17,000 I can invest with.** I was thinking about finally buying into an index fund, but I don't really want to do that until the Fed pivots. So with the dollar strong, I've just kept it can cash for the time being (which I kind of hate, because I like to keep as little cash as humanly possible -- every dollar I hold onto feels like a game of hot potato). 

But today I kind of went down a rabbithole WatchCharts(dot)com and saw that the Rolex index was down considerably and that got me thinking it could be another good alt-investment to add to my precious metals hoard.

I have no interest in wearing it. I figured I'd just use it as an investment vehicle -- buy it -- and lock it up.

Yet, although I know how to sell gold, silver, or platinum if I ever want to liquidate any of my holdings in the future... I don't know if it's as easy to sell a Rolex at current market prices.

personalfinance,How to IRA (college student),"Hi, I'm a college student and want to know how to IRA. I just finished a paid internship this summer for context.

How does this stuff work exactly? I'll list some of my priors here. I think that (not for my internship though) companies will match a percentage of 401k contribution (where you are limited to ~20k). I think that once you leave this gets moved to your traditional IRA account. I think you are allowed to contribute a smaller amount of money (~6k) split between your traditional IRA (taxed upon retrieval) and a Roth IRA (pretaxed).

How does one go about creating a traditional IRA account? I see that many companies offer accounts. Is the rule that the aggregate contributions to all accounts must be below the federal limit (~6k)? Is there any reason to not make only one account? Is there any reason that I should not contribute right now?

From what I understand, I think I surpass the Roth IRA income limit. I have been told to backdoor. I only know roughly that this has to do with converting a traditional IRA account at some point in time. How exactly does this work? If I've already made past the requirement this year, is it now impossible to do this (and how can I prepare to do this once I graduate)?",finance,1663316853

personalfinance,"Roughly 8k in loan &amp; credit card debt after life got bad. Haven't paid most of them in 3 or so months due to debts being above my income. What's the best solution? Tally, maybe?","At the end of last year, shit went sideways and I had to restart from 0. Couldn't find jobs that would pay me as much as I was making, etc. Spent time sick. It sucked. Went from making 80k a year to $15 an hour. I made it work for maybe 2 months then I needed a loan. Then another loan. Then a loan to cover those loans. I've got 4 loans currently plus a few Credit Cards totaling somewhere around 8000 in total balance. A balance of around $1774 a month in pure loan debts in addition to me paying a mortgage, bills and other expenses. Things corrected a bit when I began working two jobs (80 hours a week) both at $15 an hour. I was actually making some money. Then I had to stop working both jobs because my ""main job"" needed me to move to a different shift and health-wise, I couldn't keep going with two jobs for too much longer. This sent me down to making $2000 a month instead of $4000 again. Unfortunately, I had to prioritize some bills over others and now my credit score is fucked (800s to 400s from May to now). I was also promised a raise and promotion. Got promoted, raise kept being pushed back. However, with my raise finally on the horizon (OCTish), I want to jump back on this and start to get everything paid off but I don't know what exactly to do. I didn't want to stop paying or ignore my debts, I just honestly didn't have money and was stuck. Trying to correct the mistakes. What I need help with are these. I've got:

\- LOAN 1: $1525 balance (35.95% APR) \[roughly $84 biweekly\] 

\- LOAN 2: $705 balance (159% APR) \[roughly $112 biweekly\]

\- LOAN 3: $2957 balance (8.97% APR) \[roughly $101 monthly\]

\- LOAN 4: $2812 balance (26.15% APR) \[roughly $121 monthly\]

\- I owe one more loan but I have no idea to who or how much.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I apply for a consolidation loan? I feel like they'd say no. I saw an ad for Tally, a debt consolidation app? But IDK what to do. This sub has taught me to pay out highest interest rate first. Which I can do. The highest loan APR seems to be the lowest balance. I can knock that one out in October and then the second lowest over the rest of the year, then pick back up monthly payments for the rest after that? I don't know if that's realistic?

**We have apartments in other cities in the country**, but for professional reasons, we can’t go and live there and live in a remote city.

Is smarter to keep buying BTC instead of buying another apartment? (Especially since interest rates are going up and people can’t access funding and that will imply most likely a downturn in prices in a few months).

stocks,World Bank: Global rates hikes could trigger 2023 recession,"Q: what approach are you taking? Are buying small amounts frequently (aka DCA) or jumping in all at once? Are you anticapating prices dropping further next year or not? Most have returned to pre-pandemic level or there abouts.

Article by Annabelle Liang, Business Reporter. BBC News

Interest rate hikes by central banks around the world could trigger a global recession in 2023, the World Bank has said.

Central banks have raised rates ""with a degree of synchronicity not seen over the past five decades"" to tackle soaring prices, it said.
Raising rates makes borrowing more expensive to try to bring down the pace of price rises.
But it also makes loans more costly, which can slow economic growth.
The warning from the World Bank comes ahead of monetary policy meetings by the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, which are expected to increase key interest rates next week.
On Thursday, the World Bank said the global economy was in its steepest slowdown following a post-recession recovery since 1970. 
It said a study found that ""the world's three largest economies - the US, China and the euro area - have been slowing sharply"".
""Under the circumstances, even a moderate hit to the global economy over the next year could tip it into recession,"" it said.
The World Bank also called on central banks to coordinate their actions and ""communicate policy decisions clearly"" to ""reduce the degree of tightening needed"".
Inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, hit a 40-year-high in the US and UK in recent months.
This was driven by higher demand as pandemic restrictions eased, and as the war in Ukraine boosted energy, fuel and food prices.
In response, central bank policymakers have raised interest rates to cool demand from households and businesses.
However, big rate increases increase the risk of recession as it can cause an economy to slow.
Central banks do not typically run policy decisions by their counterparts.
They have in the past, however, coordinated their actions to support the global economy.
In 2007, a global financial crisis was precipitated by a subprime mortgage crisis in the US.
This developed into a full-blown crash after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008.
A month later, the Fed, along with the European Central Bank and central banks in Canada, Sweden and Switzerland, jointly lowered their key interest rates.
They said in a statement that the ""intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability"".
""Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted,"" they added.",finance,1663333473

personalfinance,Need advice on where to put my money- pay off loans or invest? Or both?,"I have an adjustable rate, HELOC currently at 5.25% that I am only required to pay interest on for 5 years, after which the total will come due. That said, I am currently paying quite a bit over towards the principle on this.  I also will soon have a fixed car loan at 3.9%, 60 mo (as soon as the car comes in).  I also contribute monthly to my retirement account, which has gone down in the past year, of course.  3 year gains are flat. Credit cards are paid off completely each month. Credit score is in the 800+ range. Near retirement age.

 I've been advised to only pay the minimum payments on these ""since inflation is so high"" by a close relative who is quite wealthy.  Unfortunately he is a bit unapproachable to ask these questions.

What would be my best course of action to pay the least in interest yet maintain some gains in my retirement account?  Should I contribute less there and put that money towards the HELOC or the car?  Would paying the minimum be a smart decision? That goes against my theory of paying down the highest interest rate obligation as quickly as possible.

CryptoCurrency,Why the Biden Administrations Report is a Shoulder Shrug Event,"Earlier today the Biden Administration finally released the rest of the report that was due after he signed the March 9th Executive Order. When it broke I noticed I was tagged several times in the thread about it with some people commenting on what I had previously written about. Since I do work on The Hill and have been involved with numerous briefings and events the biggest thing that I have tried to bring to the community here is an insight into what is going on in D.C. in Congress about this industry that we all care about. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are numerous ways to frame this report and while some try to paint it in an actionable plan others are discussing how it really is nothing but a nothing burger. Like all things, the truth lies somewhat in the middle but I want to address the big ones and explain the big takeaways findings. If there is something you have a question about please comment it below and to the best of my ability I will try to provide an answer. Before I jump in though I do what to state that this is not the final report. Most sections/reports were due last week or 180 days after the signing of the EO but there are still 4 sections of the EO that are not due for an additional 30 days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Breaking down the Executive Order can be done in a few different ways from the 9 different reports issued, the 6 priorities laid out, or what impact this actually has. That being said the 6 priorities that were to be addressed were consumer and investor protection, financial stability, illicit finance, U.S. leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness, financial inclusion, and responsible innovation. When I see this list what I see are really two categories. The first is about the person and the second is about the U.S. standing itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

What the report heavily focuses on is something that I think most people would admit is important to some extent and that is protecting investors/users from malicious actions. It is already in this first issue we hit the main issue that this entire report runs into. The Administration does not create or pass laws that job is left to Congress. To make a point of saying that they are doing something the various government agencies do state or list new or expanded steps they plan to take and that is why we see the words ""redoubling"" a lot. See these agencies can say they want to do something or try and expand and do something else but they again run into the Congress issue. Congress is the one that sets the budget and pays for these agencies to exist so they might have these crazy hopes and dreams but it does not mean that they will be getting the money to do so. There will be some things that they can clean up rather easily like the blatant scams that get promoted and honestly it does not involve too much money or resources for them to address but again they only have some much money and they already have submitted their budgets months ago for next year. Interestingly enough not a ton is discussed about inclusion and I personally feel it is because it is known that crypto is much more inclusive than traditional finance is. Not saying it still cannot improve but it has shown the ability to perform much better. 

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. leadership sections really break down to one thing and one thing only. Does the U.S. need a central bank digital currency (CBDC)? I have to admit the report has left me a little bamboozled as in the EO the Federal Reserve, an entity already doing an enormous amount of work on this, was not included in requests for reports, and instead, the Admin went to the Treasury Department. Well, this led to an answer that shocking does not mean much as the Treasury will now be doing research into this topic ignoring the years of research that the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the U.S., has already done. The general response from the report was not in support of it as it did not call out that we needed to develop one. Since FedNow is getting ready to roll out instant payment without the typical 3-5 business day window will become possible and over time I would assume standard. This report though has now set up the Fed and Treasury to end up clashing in the future as the idea is further pursued and who would be in charge of it or in charge of what parts. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is expected that the Admin will now work on legislation to present to Congress to have them act upon but there is a huge issue with that. Congress is in session for the next two weeks followed by a month off. We then have elections and a lame-duck Congress and this makes it highly unlikely that any significant legislation is passed as they typically do not. The report really highlighted the shortcomings of the way things are set up and showed that the Admin can only do so much without Congressional approval and passed legislation. Some of this passed legislation is destined to clash with these reports and set up agency and executive branch infighting over who gets what piece of the pie.",cryptocurrency,1663345015

Those statements included promises to invest in digital assets, when, in reality, Edelman used their funds to bankroll his personal expenses.

The complaint also alleges that Edelman engaged in “Ponzi-like” activities by sending some investors early repayments to encourage them to make larger investments in the scheme. It described the investors as elderly and “relatively unknowledgeable” about crypto.

The case marks the second time this week SEC regulators have gone after bad actors in the crypto space. On Wednesday, the SEC sued a Chicago-based crypto company that allegedly sold $1.5 million in unregistered tokens and misled its investors about the nature of the sales.

CryptoMarkets,The White House released a framework for crypto regulation in the United States. How do you think the crypto prices will react to government regulations?,"With crypto adoption on the macro-rise, regulators have keenly been keeping an eye out on the space. Of late, they’ve also been addressing the elephant in the room. Just a day back, for instance, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that staked cryptocurrencies could be subject to federal securities regulations. 

 Now, in what is the latest development, the Biden administration has laid out a crypto [framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) outlining what regulations should look like. Here, it is worth recalling that President Biden had instructed federal agencies to examine the risks and benefits of cryptos and report their findings. The current framework is a response to these findings. 

 US’s stance on CBDCs had been sort of muffled until now. However, it looks like the Biden administration is all set to take a step closer to a digital currency.

Notably, the Federal Reserve will “continue its ongoing CBDC research, experimentation, and evaluation.” More so, because a digital dollar could enable a payment system that is “more efficient, provides a foundation for further technological innovation, facilitates faster cross-border transactions, and is environmentally sustainable.” Furthermore, the released framework added,

**“It could promote financial inclusion and equity by enabling access for a broad set of consumers.”**

However, it was also emphasized that the digital dollar should be created only if it was in “national interest.” Here, it is also worth recalling that Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell**,** [previously stated](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/jerome-powell-promotes-cbdc-digital-dollar-warns-against-stablecoins.html) the main incentive for the U.S. to launch its own CBDC would be to eliminate cryptos’ use case.

personalfinance,"Should a chunk of my 401k be in ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund""?","Hi! I am pretty much a noob with 401ks and the market as a whole and I was looking around a bit in my 401k and noticed a decent chunk of my 401k is in the Vanguard Federal Money Market and from what I read online that is like a stand-still fund that you use for actual investments/stocks?   


My question is if that money should be going into something else (like the other stocks/funds in this Moderate Portfolio - *screenshot link below*) or if it will automatically do that on its own or something?  
**Portfolio and allocations percent (omitted $'s)**: [https://i.imgur.com/V7kW0QN.png](https://i.imgur.com/V7kW0QN.png)  


We recently (last summer) had our 401ks moved from Vanguard to Slavik, and before then it seemed like there was noticeable gains but after a year and half now with Slavik I swear I have almost lost money over time even with continuous investing - so I don't know if it didn't transfer right, or if the allocations are wrong, or if the market is just down the gutter and automatically being cautious.   


I have tried solo researching this a bit to learn more but am not getting much from that.   


My only fear is that I did something wrong with the transfer and it is not buying stocks correctly. If the market is simply bad that is fine, I understand enough to know that I should keep investing - just don't want to realize one day that my contributions were not actually being bought or something and it was all just sitting idle due to my lack of knowledge.   


I have tried using Slaviks report generator as well, and while it does show dollar balances over two time periods it does not show me starting and ending share amounts so its hard for me to truly see what is going on I guess.  


Any advice/guidance appreciated, thanks! :)


EDIT: thanks for all the advice! It sounds like since I am younger (31) it is smarter for me to move this portfolio into a target fund, which I have done.

CryptoCurrency,"Are we about to have our final capitulation moment to mark the bottom? Yes, *IF* crypto history repeats itself","After 10 months since our all time high, we are without a doubt deep in bear territory. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is a little over 70% down at $19.5k and this week has been unsettling to say the least. It is difficult for Bitcoin to catch a bid. With the exception of some shitcoins, *everything* is (slowly) crumbling: Stocks, crypto, commodities, and gold. This is perhaps not surprising, as inflation is very high and so far not coming down despite interest rate hikes, energy prices are still very high, and there is a lot of fear and uncertainty in the market. The best performing major asset is the US Dollar (USD), and even USD is losing value quick due to inflation.

**Is it about to get worse?**

I fear that it is about to get worse before it finally starts getting better and I found some data \*suggesting\* that might be the case. As can be seen in the chart below, after about 310 days since the major peak, we are at the exact same percentage drawdown from all time high that we were in the 2017-2018 bear market and 2013-2015 bear market. A rather peculiar coincidence. Both times, the final capitulation moment was close. Although the difference between \~70% and \~84% might not seem large, from all time high this means we could drop about another 50% to around $10k.

[The Bitcoin returns since the major peaks in &amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/y7f7yprcw9o91.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=885cb98a2fde373edb332457db0ae3a610c3a33e)

But Beyonderr, crypto has not seen a recession and such economic turmoil, so what is the point of looking at past bear markets? Firstly let me say that it is a miracle that we are still at 20k from that perspective. Moreover, I dont think it is an entirely wasted comparison, given that the worse economic environment is partly offset by the high levels of institutional adoption we see every day. That said, obviously, we have no clue what a recession would do to crypto despite all the adoption. This market is too young.

**Confluence in Stocks**

There is confluence for the ""one more drop"" thesis if one has a look at stocks though - and this data is in a sense more relevant because stocks have been around much longer. Interestingly, we seem to be following the 2008 S&amp;P 500 (SPX) bear market fracal to near perfection, as can be seen in the two charts below here. The similarity in the fractals is eery. Back in 2008, we also were also close to having our capitulation drop.

&amp;#x200B;

[The S&amp;P 500 \(SPX\) bear market fractal from 2008 \(black\) and current chart \(orange\) overlaid on top of each other](https://preview.redd.it/0vb6e6uhw9o91.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fad16b6c15b766db80830d613a7ddd7564851c81)

[S&amp;P 500 \(SPX\) bear market fractal from 2008 \(yellow\) next to current chart presenting the same information as the chart above](https://preview.redd.it/eutrz15pw9o91.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24bfb2b891d682b0b58232c44df6dc57d2c90ebc)

Lastly, the chart below shows a red line each time the Nasdaq dropped 4% or more. Such days tend to happen during capitulation moments. It is possible that similar to 2008 and 1987, we see several of these massive selloff days in a row. During bear times, 4% drops never happen in isolation, and we already had two days of 4% drawdown or more. This usually marks the bottom though as these days are rare.

[The Nasdaq with red lines showing the days with a 4&amp;#37; or more drawdown. ](https://preview.redd.it/iyepqjg5x9o91.jpg?width=1791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fb625bca87fd9b5d74d32097f1dc7c096d299dc)

**Conclusion**

*If* there is a final capitulation to mark the bottom, this will likely present an incredibly buying opportunity. Will this happen? Obviously we dont know because there are no guarantees, only estimates. But it isnt looking too pretty.

All I wanted to do was share some data, so you can make your own perhaps just a little bit better informed decision on how to move forward from here. Even if it gives some people a 1% better odds or a bit more money it would be worth it. Please dont base any decisions off of this post alone, there are plenty of arguments for why the bottom would be in (e.g. many bottom indicators of crypto are flashing). All I wanted to do was inform people who might find this relevant.

They have become top/#1 validator for most other popular PoS networks and ETH was their next Victim. They then charge outrageous commission fees to steal more of your hard earned money:

Cosmos Network - Coinbase surpassed Stakefish to become #1 validator with the largest voting right/voting power for changes the network. They charge a 20% commission and only give you 5% APY of the rewards even though it should be 18% as stated on their Block Explorer. (20%)

Tezos - Coinbase has become too private validator for this LPoS network. They charge a 13.39% commission, one of the highest in the network. They have largest voting power/voting rights for changes to the network. (13.39%)

Solana - Coinbase Cloud is top/#1 validator for the network. They charge an okay commission, closer to what other top validators on the network charge (8%) but still high. They have the largest voting rights/voting power for changes to the network.

CryptoCurrency,Summary of the Whitehouse Fact Sheet on Digital Assets [serious],"The other 2 threads on this were filled with jokes and useless comments from people who did not read the document. Here's an actual summary that highlights the most important parts.

Back in March 2022, Biden announced an Executive Order to study the risks and benefits of ""Digital Assets"", i.e. cryptocurrencies. Here are the results from 9 of the reports that have been returned so far.

##Findings

- Consumer banking is insufficient
- 7M Americans have no bank account, and 24M rely on costly financial services.
- Cross-border payments are slow and costly
- 16% of US adults have purchased cryptocurrencies
- Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations remains widespread. A quarter of ICOs had disclosure or transparency problems, false promises of guaranteed returns, or plagiarized documents.
- Outright fraud, scams and theft are rampant and on the rise, with a 600% increase from 2020 to 2021.
- Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, and often impose large risks on consumers and investors. Sellers commonly misled consumers about features and expected returns.
- Terra UST caused a loss of $600B in consumer assets

##Plans of action

- Encourage regulators like the CFTC, SEC, and CFPB to **pursue investigations into unlawful practices**. Encourages them to get along and collaborate.
- Encourage regulators to **issue guidance and rules** to address current and emerging risks
- Encourage FLEC (Financial Literacy Education Commission) to **educate consumers** in understanding risks
- **Get everyone banked**. 2023 launch of FedNow, an **instantaneous 24/7 interbank clearing system**, working alongside the existing Clearinghouse Real-Time Payments (RTP) system. (Similar to the UK's Faster Payments Service, which already sends 98% of paychecks in the UK. For the record, systems like Zelle already use RTP for settlement, which is why they can offer settlement within seconds.)

##Further research

- Explore instant cross-border payment systems and work towards improving efficiency of them
- Investigate technical and behavioral economics of digital assets
- **OSTP** (Office of Science and Technology Policy) and **NSF** (National Science Foundation) to research next-gen cryptography, transaction programmability, and cybersecurity
- **FSOC** (Financial Stability Oversight Council) will publish additional report discussing cryptocurrency risks and regulatory gaps in October
- **Treasury** and **NSF** to identify and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities and market risks. Both to provide industry with guidelines.
- **Department of Energy** and **EPA** to track environmental impact and harms
- **Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, USAID, State Department** will continue doing their normal roles related to digital assets, as well as continue research into digital assets.
- US agencies will promote discussion and guidelines in international forums
- Continue to pursue **Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism** with an emphasis on ransomware, drug trafficking, and funding of terrorist groups (e.g. DPRK's Lazarus Group).
- Research if a **US CBDC** is needed. No actions have been planned concerning CBDCs.

I've seen some quotes on EnergySage that range from $2.80/Watt (local) to $3.45 (NRG - supposedly using top of the line panels (Q-cells) and inverters (Enphase I-Q8M)).

Sunpower seems like a decent bet as far as the longevity of the company going forward which is my primary reason for thinking $3.54/W isn't a bad deal.

We're fairly certain this  system will cover our current power needs going forward and the rep we  spoke to said we can always add panels in the future, because we're  planning on getting EV's in a few years. My plan is to get an EV that can function a house backup battery in the event of a grid failure, but the rep admitted he wasn't sure if the system was compatible and that I'd have to speak to the site surveyor they'd send after the contract was signed. Otherwise, we're fortunate to have never dealt with grid stability issues and I don't think a regular backup battery is worth the added cost.

Sunpower seems like a decent company by most accounts, but my biggest concern would be longevity/quality of panels considering they're these U-Series  that no one seems to know anything about.

There is a financing option at .99%, but they can't offer that on another proposal (see: Fed raising rates) and then the system ends up being around $4.60/W at a total cost of $18,429 (Still less than my current monthly power bill).

personalfinance,Please help 22 year old figure out what to do with family money,"Hi,  


I'm 22 and I moved to the US a few years ago. No one in my family knows anything about investing or money management (or anything related to education, healthcare, insurances, taxes etc). I've been having a really hard time navigating everything. I was hoping to get some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

My family has about 200-300k in cash, basically everything my dad saved up for the past 20 years. Keeping it all in cash (in bank) and no investments seems like a bad move. Let me just specify our goals and please let me know what you think we should invest in.

&amp;#x200B;

1) We want to minimize risk, i.e. preferably guaranteed securities FDIC or NCUA insured.

2) 3mo or less of commitment. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reasoning for both is that we are trying to buy a house, and if one that we can afford and is good presents itself, we  want the liquidity to be able to purchase it. We expect to be looking for housing for 3mo-2yrs depending on the market, but we don't want to find a great house but not be able to withdraw our money or find that the market has halved it. Other than these two, we just want to optimize for best returns. Here are some options I've considered:

&amp;#x200B;

Option A) SoFi, Ally Bank, or Basket Bank. They all seem to be FDIC insured, and range between 2-2.5% APY. Which is definitely better than 0% which we are getting now. Downside is that APY is taxed.

&amp;#x200B;

Option B) Treasury bonds or state bonds. I don't fully understand this but I'm aware that it is sometimes tax exempt? And also available for 1,2,3,6 month commitments? And we can sell before the commitment time ends too? Any additional information on this would be greatly appreciated. The tax exemption makes the 2-3% APY equivalent to like 5-6% APY where I would have to pay tax.

&amp;#x200B;

Option C) Investing in high dividend yield stocks like energy stocks of Kinder Morgan, Clearway Energy, and Schweitzer-Mauduit. This will give more yield but obviously more risky.

&amp;#x200B;

Option D) Investing in some kind of crypto stablecoins something something 9% APY something something. My friend told me about this, extremely skeptical and definitely know nothing about it. Just thought I'd mention it in case my friend is in the right.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Additional information, I'm in the 32% federal tax bracket, and 9.3% state tax bracket (CA). Only other investments I have are my 401K which I've had for a few months, and an HSA account.

*****
&gt; Stocks fell Friday as Wall Street wrapped up one of its worst weeks in months and traders reacted to an ugly earnings warning from FedEx about the global economy.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 139.40 points, or 0.45%, to close at 30,822.42. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.72% to end the week at 3,873.33. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.90% to finish at 11,448.40. It was the worst week for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq since June.
*****
&gt; Shares of FedEx plunged 21.4%, their worst daily drop ever, after the shipments company withdrew its full-year guidance and said it will implement cost-cutting initiatives to contend with soft global shipment volumes as the global economy “significantly worsened.”
*****
&gt; Transport stocks are typically seen as a leading indicator for the stock market as well as the economy, and FedEx pointed to weakness in Asia as one of the main reasons for its negative outlook. Shares of shipping rivals UPS and XPO Logistics dropped about 4.5% and 4.7%, respectively, and Amazon’s stock fell 2.1%.
*****
&gt; FedEx’s announcement comes soon after a hotter-than-expected inflation report in the U.S. on Tuesday, which raised concerns that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cause a recession to cool prices. That data sparked a decline of more than 1,200 points for the Dow.
*****
&gt; “There is a lot of nervousness about how the global economy can affect the U.S. economy now, while the U.S. economy is dealing with its own set of very serious issues. I think that dynamic is what people have woken up to,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro.
*****
&gt; The three major averages suffered their fourth losing week in five, and the summer comeback rally looks increasingly like a bear market bounce. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 4.1% this week. The S&amp;P 500 lost 4.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped about 5.5%.

&gt; # What a Way to Start the Weekend

&gt; If you've been in a particularly bad mood heading into weekends this year, you're obviously paying pretty close attention to the markets. With today's decline, the S&amp;P 500 is in the familiar position of ending the week with a decline of 1% or more. If the current declines hold up into the close, it will be the 12th daily drop of 1% or more to end a week this year. Going back to 1952 when the five trading day week started, there have only been five other years (1974, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2008) where there were as many or more down 1% Fridays (or last trading day of the week) in a given year. As you might expect, all five of those years were lousy for the stock market.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091622-Number-Down-1-Weeks2.png))**

&gt; While this year is currently tied for having the fourth-highest number of 1%+ down days, the year isn't even three-quarters done (heaven help us). After today there are still another 15 weeks left in the year, so there is plenty of time to move up the rankings. On a percentage basis, the S&amp;P 500 has closed down at least 1% on the last trading day of the week just under a third (32.4%) of the time, and if that pace were to keep up for the remainder of the year, 2022 would easily set the record for the highest frequency of 1% declines to close out the week. Never have we needed a happy hour more than this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ba2711672107ac095a7779b315c1f612/490d4ab446266551-02/s400x600/441d01b753ddc80b68fb09671198b26055aa683f.jpg))**

&gt; On page 108 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (see pinned tweet) we discuss the Aura of the Triple Witch, when stock options, stock index options and stock index futures all expire at the same time four times each year. It’s important as it usually increases volume and volatility.

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –0.98%, S&amp;P 500 –0.89%, NASDAQ –0.85% and Russell 2000 –1.44%. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter. And next week we have the Fed rate hike decision to contend with.

&gt; # Bad CPI, ugly trading, but history of 4% daily declines shows good gains…eventually

&gt; Today’s hotter than anticipated CPI report was the bad that triggered the day’s ugly across-the-board declines. Surging Treasury bond yields hit NASDAQ the hardest, off 5.16% today. Tech-heavy S&amp;P 500 was down 4.32% while DJIA was off 3.94%. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has declined 4% or more in a single day 53 times before today. In those previous 53 occurrences, on the next trading day S&amp;P 500 was higher 35 times and lower 18 with an average gain of 1.08% on all days. Based upon historical performance, the odds of a gain tomorrow are 66.04%.

&gt; However, the line chart of the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 53 greater than 4% drops does not suggest any significant advance in the near-term as S&amp;P 500 only managed a modest recover, on average over the next 20-25 trading days (a typical month is generally 21 trading days). But the following table does showcase solid gains in the majority of occurrences when looking forward the next 3-, 6- and 12-months. S&amp;P 500 was higher 82.7% of the time one year after a greater than 4% daily decline with an average gain over 25%.

&gt; # 11%+ Annualized - Not Bad for the 'Worst Trade Ever'

&gt; It has now been 14 years since Lehman Brothers' last day as a solvent company - an event that set off one of the biggest market meltdowns of all time. In hindsight, the events leading up to and after September 2008 may not seem all that bad. How quickly we forget. Three-quarters of a century removed from the Great Depression, most Americans had never given a second thought to the safety of the funds in their savings account or even money-market funds, but shortly after Lehman, these were legitimate concerns on the part of all Americans. People were actually going to ATMs and taking out extra cash to literally put 'under their mattress' just in case they woke up and the ATMs weren't working anymore.

&gt; Most of these extremes came after the Lehman bankruptcy, but the period leading up to Lehman wasn't a picnic either; that's actually why Lehman went belly-up. From the S&amp;P 500's peak in October 2007 through 9/12/08, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 20%. But after an early summer sell-off, the S&amp;P 500 rallied from mid-July to mid-August before selling off into Labor Day. Heading into the weekend after Labor Day, the S&amp;P 500 was down 4% from its mid-August high but appeared to be stabilizing at a higher low relative to July. With the S&amp;P 500 still down 20% from its all-time high, you couldn't have faulted someone heading into the weekend for thinking ""maybe I'll try to buy something on sale.""

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091222-100907.png))**

&gt; On 9/12/08, stocks may have been on sale relative to the October 2007 highs, but any buys on that day would quickly go down as one of the 'worst trades ever.' After Lehman announced its bankruptcy that weekend, cracks spread all over the financial district from a Wall Street parched of liquidity. September ended with a decline of nearly 10% but continued to get worse from there, and by the following March, the S&amp;P 500 was down just under 46% - or 71% annualized - from its 'pre-Lehman' close'. Stocks that seemed cheap less than six months earlier were now down by nearly half, so getting back to even from there would pretty much require a double. Speaking from experience, any investor who bought any stocks in those six months quickly felt like the stupidest investor in the world.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091222-091208-030909.png))**

&gt; While any equity purchases made 14 years ago just before Lehman collapsed quickly turned into some of the worst trades ever, time is an investor's best friend. Anyone who had time gradually looked less foolish. From a longer-term perspective, the decline from September 2008 to March 2009 still looks painful, but over time, the market (as it has to this point always done) dug itself out of its hole. The snowball effect of compounding has rewarded investors who were in it for the long haul. Not including dividends, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 227% since the Friday before Lehman's bankruptcy, and including dividends, it has delivered an annualized return of more than 11%. You'd probably sign the bottom line as fast as you could for an annualized return of 11% between now and 2036!

&gt; Not bad for what seemed like the ""worst trade ever"" at the time.

&gt; # Buckle Up, Late September Can Be Rocky

&gt; We are winding down an absolutely awesome time at Carson’s Excell experience in Las Vegas. It has been a ton of fun meeting with our advisors, learning more about our industry, presenting our investment views, but best of all making new friends. If you want to come to the very best conference for advisors, please be sure to make it next year in Nashville.

&gt; Here’s a quick blog I put together (take note I’m running on fumes out here) that looks at seasonality and why late September and into October is one period that investors need to be aware can be bumpy.

&gt; Here’s a similar chart, but it looks at midterm years. Yes, right about now isn’t historically a bullish timeframe, but check out what tends to happen once you get later in the year and past the uncertainty of the midterm election. We are optimistic that history could repeat itself once again.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2-3-800x318.png))**

&gt; Zooming in some and it becomes even more clear that late September can be a slide down.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3-3-800x369.png))**

&gt; Another look at this is a popular chart we’ve shared before, but it really does a nice job of showing just how weak some of the upcoming days are for the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/4-2-800x475.png))**

&gt; So buckle up, as the calendar isn’t doing to any near-term favors, but we remain overweight equities and think the low for the year is in and once we can get past this seasonally weak period, a nice end of year rally is quite possible.

&gt; # Sentiment Contradicts Price Action

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 may have fallen around 1.5% over the past week, but individual investors have reportedly become increasingly bullish. 26.1% of responses to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish this week, up from a recent low of 18.1% last week. With the S&amp;P 500's worst day in since June 2020 and a hotter-than-expected CPI print occurring late in the response collection period (12:01 AM on Thursday through 11:59 PM Wednesday night), the timing of responses is a potential cause for the increase in optimism that was contrary to equities' price action. In other words, responses that came in prior to Tuesday were likely far more bullish than those that came in afterward and therefore elevating the level of bullish sentiment. As such, next week will be a more telling read on individual investor sentiment as it will more fully capture recent price action and inflation data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091522-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; While bulls rose back above a quarter of responses, bears fell back below 50%. Bearish sentiment dropped to 46% which was only the lowest level since the week of August 24th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091522-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Those moves meant the bull-bear spread rose 15.3 points week over week going from -35.2 up to -19.9. That was the largest one-week jump in the reading since the end of June. However, that indicates sentiment remains heavily in favor of pessimism as the streak of negative readings grows to 24 weeks long; the second longest streak of negative readings on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091522-AAII-3.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/091522-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showing a rebound in sentiment. Both the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index highlighted increased bullishness in the latest week's data. As with the AAII survey, though, the collection periods likely did not fully capture the effects of Tuesday's inflation data and historic one-day decline. Overall, the story remains that investors are remarkably bearish.

&gt; # 4% Daily Drop with VIX Under 30 Unheard Of

&gt; Today’s bounce back was in line with the stats we posted yesterday, but the gains and trading were uninspired. What stuck out was the 4% drop came with VIX below 30 all day. Never happened before.

&gt; Since 1990 when VIX data began S&amp;P 500 had 42 daily declines of 4% or more. Only 8 had a VIX print below 30 and zero that did not have a print above 30. 7 of the 8 opened below 30 and one hit a low below 30 intraday. VIX was below 30 all day 9/13/2022.

&gt; October 27, 1997 Asian contagion mini crash, February 5, 2018 inflation fear selloff and June 11, 2020 Covid second wave scare were one-offs. The rest were just the beginning of trouble. Triple Witching, end Q3, Fed decision, September’s bearish history, Octoberphobia, midterms could make the comps between now and then a little fuzzy. But September 15, 2008, was also Monday of Triple Witching Week – and that brings in the scary 2008 analog into play, but that’s for another day.

&gt; # Pain in CPI

&gt; With investors expecting consumer prices to fall month-over-month heading into the day, this morning's higher-than-expected headline and core CPI reports caused an instantaneous reversal in market sentiment heading into the opening bell. While equity index futures were indicating a gain of around 75 basis points heading into the print, after the release, indications were for a decline of 2%. When the opening bell finally rang, the S&amp;P 500 gapped down 2.27% as indicated by the tracking ETF - SPY.

&gt; Going back to 1998, today marked just the sixth time that SPY gapped down in excess of 2% on the day of a CPI release. As shown in the top of the table below, on four of the five prior 2%+ gaps down on CPI days, SPY not only gapped down by over 2%, but it continued lower throughout the trading day. While that doesn't necessarily bode well for today, we would note that on many of those prior occurrences, there were other overriding factors impacting the market. From the Russian debt default and collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998 to the Financial Crisis in 2008, the US debt downgrade in 2011, and then COVID in 2020, on most of these other days, investors had other issues besides inflation to worry about. The only time that there wasn't another major issue impacting the market was on 5/14/99 when headline CPI exceeded forecasts by 0.3 ppts and core CPI exceeded consensus estimates by 0.2 ppts.

&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have listed every other time since 1998 that core CPI exceeded consensus forecasts by 0.3 ppts or more. Today's report is just the fourth time that core CPI has topped estimates by such a wide margin, but what stands out most is that every other prior occurrence since 1998 came after COVID. We noted numerous times in the past how COVID has created so many distortions in the economy that the job of forecasting it has become exceedingly difficult, and the fact that every 'beat' of this magnitude in core CPI has occurred since COVID only reinforces this point.

personalfinance,"Anxiety-induced paralysis over new car purchase... but I've done everything right, right?","First time posting here, I read the rules but lmk if anything needs changing... sorry it's a long post but I'm having a lot of anxiety over this and hope I can gain some perspective from this awesome community.

Quick intro: I'm a young professional (will be 30 next year), with a stable dual-income household and no kids. I live in a very HCOL area but my salary is proportionally generous.

I haven't owned a car in \~4 years, after my last one (bought used at 9 years old) had a mechanical issue that was disproportionately expensive to repair, leading me to sell to a scrapper. I live in a very dense city that generally has decent transit coverage, so I saved money by not replacing my vehicle and instead hoofing it daily to and from work.

Now, years later, I've reached my breaking point. Not being able to ""live life"" fully during COVID has made me restless and depressed. I'm also physically and mentally exhausted from my daily grind. I can't work from home, so I easily walk 5+ miles a day, and take 2 trains, to get to and from work, resulting in 3 hours of commuting daily. I used to put my dog in daycare every day when he was a pup (high needs and intelligence means he can't be alone all day), but to save money I've started taking him to work with me. Our commute together is stressful, to say the least. We pass through multiple rough areas to get to and from the transit station and several times over the past year I've had to pepper spray stray dogs and people on drugs who've come charging at us. I'm now constantly on high alert and ready to be attacked, peering around corners and even exiting my train on random platforms to avoid sketchy situations. Conditions on the ground have definitely gotten progressively worse because of the economic downtown caused by the pandemic, and I can't take it anymore. I've started paying for $60 Ubers, $35 carshares, etc. to avoid my regular commute. It's been adding up. I've realized it's time for me to get my own car.

I sat down and thought about it hard. I've had a depressing and exhausting few years just grinding away at my career, putting in long hours, and overall feeling like I've been ""living to work"". I've had two cars before in my life, and both were burdensome, old, and not fun to drive or own. Even so, I made a lot of lifestyle sacrifices the past few years due to not having a car, and I decided what I really want is a vehicle that 1) I actually LIKE and 2) that allows me to get back to doing things I really enjoy. Being very outdoorsy and adventurous, and living in a part of the US that allows me to really get out and explore, I looked at a lot of options but my heart is decided on a Jeep Wrangler. Those things are gas guzzlers though, so I'm looking at the 4xe hybrid, which is more expensive. For longevity and resale value, I then added all the safety and technology features that are standard in most other cars. I also added in options for features that I absolutely loved about my last car which I know I'd use daily. The end result is a $72k vehicle.

Now, my family growing up was solidly middle class. We never owned a new vehicle, ever. We never wasted food because food was expensive. The majority of our things were hand-me-downs. We basically only took vacations when we had a free place to stay and could drive there. That sort of thing. Even now that I make good money (more than both my parents combined made in their entire careers), I still catch myself stuck in a poverty mindset of hoarding junk and skipping meals to save money, and things like that. So of course, every fiber of my being is freaking out at the thought of buying a brand new $72k vehicle.

Logically, though, I know I don't really have to be this anxious. I read the finance guides on this sub about vehicle ownership and I check nearly all of the boxes. The total value of the car, including tax, is less than 50% of my annual salary. My total car-related expenses each month would be 13% of my gross monthly income, which is 3% higher than the rule-of-thumb on this sub, but my rent is only 8.5% and my saving contributions (401k, retirement, investments) are almost 30%. I've also done the math using my actual take-home pay and my budget is still balanced with room to spare. I have an excellent credit score, and can afford to put 25% down and get an awesome sub-3% interest rate from my credit union. I would be eligible for a $7500 federal tax credit for this particular make and model if I buy before the end of the year. I have a 6-month emergency fund that can be easily accessed if needed. I have no other debts or loans besides revolving credit card debt that's paid off 100% every month. I'm not someone who generally has expensive taste, or habitually overspends. I'm very budget-conscious and careful. I have highly detailed spreadsheets for all my bills, savings goals, loan repayment projections, risk mitigation plans, you name it. My budgeting calculations are always conservative and are all double-checked by my partner, and both of us work in technical math-heavy fields, where we are both conditioned to overplan and overthink. In theory, this all checks out.

So why am I still freaking out???

I think it's all the unknowns... which I've planned for and thought about, but are anxiety-inducing nonetheless! People buy things though, people take loans. It's normal. I should be allowed to spend within my means on something I really want and would use daily, and for a very long time, especially when it would drastically improve my quality of life.

I can't bring myself to pull the trigger though. I'm losing sleep over it. I'm badly in need of a sanity check.

So, PF reddit, is this just my poverty mindset sabotaging my happiness? Or is my anxiety rational and something worth giving pause for?

Sorry again for the novel, but I'm extremely grateful to anyone who gets to the end and can lend some of their own perspective on this! 🙏 There are not many people in my life who are in a position to advise me on this and I don't know where else to turn.",finance,1663372787

personalfinance,Roof Purchase will wipe out Emergency fund,"Looks like I need to buy a roof as the one I have decided to start leaking. Home insurance wont cover it due to age of the roof and I don't have enough equity in my home for an HELOC loan. The good news is my emergency fund can cover the bill, but I'm worried on how to rebuild the emergency fund. 

The roofing company is offering a 10 year loan where the introductory rate is 0% for a year then it goes credit card high after. My current plan is to take this loan to turn this unexpected expense into an expected expense. What should I look out for with this plan?

I currently have about $140 a month to rebuild my emergency fund after the roof $9500 purchase. By cutting back I could lower my monthly expenses to leave something like $450 a month, but it just feels like a long time to be on rice and beans if you will.

The other option is to try to pay off my car loan within the year with the remainder of my emergency fund then use the cash flow to pay down the roof loan as quickly as possible. This has a benefit of removing a loan that is tying up my cash flow and allow me to rebuild, but I may not be able to pay off the roof loan before the high interest rates kick in. Are there any downfalls with this plan other than the risk I take in not paying both off?

My monthly budget brakes down to:

Take Home Pay (after 401K and HSA contributes): 4750

Mortgage: $1940 (2.99%, like 29 years left)

Student Loan: $70 (3.5%, Private loan, not subject to federal 10K forgiveness or the covid interest freeze, 8 years left)

Car Loan: $700 (4%, two years left)

Other expenses: $1900

I built my financial backbone way to late and had very poor management of it. Basically I was making ~100k/yr with a car that had continual bills over 2k every month because the transmission had a faulting wiring harness that wasn’t found until it was to late. My rent was 2k and total car bill (insurance and note) and other expenses generally ate the rest of what I had left. By the time I had been let go because the company was selling my division to a competitor, I only had around 1k in savings. My life was hell after that. Got through bankruptcy and have been rebuilding since.

I currently have 2 months of post tax income in savings, and another 4 months of pretax income in the companies savings. 
I also have a non-tax deferred money market account with around 15k in savings. I plan on putting that in a tax deferred account soon, I haven’t yet because the anxiety I have with loosing everything again. 
The corporation has enough in savings to run without paying me for the next 2 years (software I use is kind of expensive…)
Now on to my debts
I have a 30k car loan for a brand new car, interest was 12% when I got it and has been refinanced to 9% 48 months last July. 
I have gotten my associates and have around 9k in student debt that I am applying for forgiveness for.
Credit card debt is around 6k out of 20k in accounts. I know I should pay it but because of how volatile my income can be with it being contract pay I just don’t want to put myself in that position again. Reason for the debt is because I ended up getting in an accident and the medical expenses have been piling up. Im buying a market place plan as soon as open enrollment opens up. Funny enough though the debt is at a lower interest rate than my credit cards pre bankruptcy (I ended up getting a few secured cards and putting the maximum down at the start of the year.) 

Basically I am wanting to get a house within the next 3 years and will start putting 10% of my gross income (80k not 60k) in an actual employer sponsored tax account like a 401k.",finance,1663381998

personalfinance,Paying taxes on less than $400 self employment combined with regular job?,"First off if this is the wrong sun to post under, I do apologize - please lead me in the right direction to post this! 
Otherwise,
Hello! Thanks for stopping by to read this :)
I wanted to know if I owe taxes if I make less than $400 from self employment?
I know alone it wouldn’t, but because I have a regular job that I am earning above the standard deductible for this year ($12950) does this change anything?

I ask because when I do the W-4 estimator on IRS gov it does reduce my tax refund if I file in my self employment income even if it’s less than $400? 

Thank you!

Edit: 
Thank you everyone for your responses! It has really cleared everything up for me and now I know I just pay federal income tax (where I live no state income tax) because it’s below $400.",finance,1663386396

personalfinance,"Roth 401(k), what funds to invest in?","My employer offers both traditional and Roth 401(k) accounts, and I've chosen to open a Roth. They do not contribution match, instead they've got some kind of profit sharing - I've not been with them long enough to have any idea of how much that means for me (likely, not much).

I've already set up my portfolio based on what seemed okay at the time, but I honestly have no clue what I'm doing with all these different funds.

For reference:  
I'm in my late 20's.  
My salary is $54k annually.  
No other investments, just money in a savings account in case of emergency (still building up).

personalfinance,Cash purchase or installments? Longest use vs. sell+upgrade? Network locked contract payment vs. unlocked no-contract? Holidays vs. saving? Can you help me understand these?,"So I have a few different scenarios in my mind that I have always been curious about, but since these are ongoing, medium/long-term things, I’ve never figured out which is the best. I hope you wonderful people can help me understand these finances better:

##1. 

Let’s say I’m buying an item for €1000. I have a significant amount of cash sitting in my current account to be secured as a mortgage deposit in the coming months and I can afford the €1000 item in one go (except for my frugal soul may die a bit after spending it all!) Assuming that the installments option comes with no additional charges and 0% interest rate, financially speaking which is a better option? Buying in cash in one go or paying in monthly installments over two years?

##2.

Now, let’s say what I’m buying is a tech gadget (titanium+sapphire smart watch) and what I currently own cost €1000 less than two years ago (still under warranty for the first 2 years). Someone is interested in buying it off me for say €500. This year’s new model is the same price (€1000) with more features and comes in the same precious materials which seem to lose their value once the technology is outdated. Is it better to sell and upgrade or keep using the old one till it’s completely outdated in which case you’d probably get nothing if you want to sell it?

##3.

Now let’s say what I’m buying is a phone and I normally pay €20 as I go every 4 weeks for my sim. My phone purchase options are either buying it in cash at full price without being tied to a carrier and continuing with my monthly €20 top-ups, or buying it on bill pay for a 2 year period at €40 or €60 a month where my phone price is also included but tied to that carrier only. If I want to unlock the carrier limit, it will cost about €200 extra after certain number of months. Which is the more economical option?

##4.

Now, last but not least, let’s say I’m still saving for a house/apartment/hellhole(!) as much as my salary allows me for a mortgage, but I don’t have a big local social circle whereas there are international events going on that I’m finding out about without too much notice. Would/should I spend a few hundreds every other weekend and go away to hang out with people and do things or keep saving while living as frugally as I can until I’ve bought a house? (Let’s say I’ve already had some holidays in the year, but again, I live alone without much of a social life locally).",finance,1663406316

CryptoCurrency,Lebanon Banks are being closed for 3 days because people want to withdraw their money... That's a mess.,"As we are in this era of high inflation now with nearly all countries at deacde high inflation and some many at record inflation. Especially ""poorer"" countries are struggling with it such as Argentina with near 100% inflation even with 75% interest rates. Lebanon is another victim of that and more social troubles in the country.

Due to that people, as their right is, wanted to withdraw their money from the bank to use it but apparently now a bank can not do the very task it is meant to do. With that Lebanon banks just closed for 3 days and now people can't withdraw their own money, that's just crazy and a mess.

And it may be one of the situation where saying ""Crypto can solve this"" is actually true. Not only is crypto open 24/7 but also you can take out any amount of money without being tracked and followed. Obviously it's only like that if you use crypto right.

I'm a cool guy so i'm gonna give you the best advice i've carefully  catered since i've joined this pretty damn usefull sub. Are you read for it? Let me spill some fax no cap:

&amp;#x200B;

1 - **Buy High Sell Low**. This one doesn't even need any comment, it's pretty obvious and this sub's favourite jutsu.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - **Reply DMs**. If you don't know it by now you bout to find out! This sub is full of insightfull people with great wisdom always red to help. Nursy Joe got nothing on helpfull crypto bros.

&amp;#x200B;

3 - **Diversify**. Basic investiment concept. Why go full BTC or ETH when there are so cheap coins out there? one BTC costs 20k, imagine how much DOGE/SHIBA you can buy with it? Don't over think it, the more full coins you have, the better.  


4 - **Seed Phrase.**  If you are serious about crypto, you need one of these USB pens. You probabily have one laying around your dirty bedroom anyway, use it = profit. Now here is the ultimate lifehack about seedphrase. Don't write it down, just memorize it. Seriously, how much stuff you know already without needing help? You know your name, your phone number, your credit card debt so why not memorize 12 punny words? Nobody can hack your empty mind.

&amp;#x200B;

5 - **Day Trading**. What if i told you, you can make money NOW? Look at all these broke ""investors"" waiting for the market to bull, ain't nobody got time for that. On Day Trading you can multiply your account just like Goku's kaioken = instantily.   


6 - **Hard Wallet too expensive? Then make hackers waste their time.** Hackers hate this one simple trick. Think about it. They want to know where your coins are to steal them, it's quite straight forward. Now, why have your assets in one place anyway? Transfer them around daily! Are they on Binance? Transfer to your sofware wallet EXODUS, the following they transfer them do Metatask, then to another Exchange. Keep doing this daily and they will have no idea where to being with. What are simple **fees** compared to keeping your assets safe?

My theoretical question to you is what set of circumstances do you see happening that may act as a catalyst and when do you think this could happen. For example I think two events could act as a catalyst to start a new bull run, those being Spot ETF approval, or a fed policy pivot. I think these events could shift things to a positive momentum situation. Please share your thoughts. Again this is theoretical so there is no right or wrong answer!",cryptocurrency,1663427620

devops,Need Help: Issue with the Remote - Containers VScode plug in. Example below.,"Hi there so I love the ability to code in a docker container and I got it working once but have not been able to get it working since. I am not sure if it is my lack of knowledge of the plugin or if there is something more obvious I am missing. I will share a couple pieces of relevant information to hopefully diagnose the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

First here is the dockerfile I am trying to run.

    FROM amazonlinux:latest
    RUN yum install -y amazon-linux-extras &amp;&amp; amazon-linux-extras install python3.8 &amp;&amp; curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py &amp;&amp; python3.8 get-pip.py &amp;&amp; pip3 install awscli
    WORKDIR /app
    RUN echo 'alias python=python3.8' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc

A pretty straightforward Dockerfile. Simple but it gets me what I need to make a Python script.

Next. I use the Remote - Containers plugin and I use the option 'Open Folder in a Container"" It prompts me to use the ""Dockerfile.txt"" in that directory which i accept.

So at this point it begins to spin up a container using the Dockerfile in the folder I want to do development in.

I get this log.

personalfinance,using a Donor Advised Fund to Qualify for ACA Deductions,"I will try to make this short. My wife and I took this year off to help my Dad fight Pancreatic cancer. We used the affordable care act for health Insurance and planned on pulling money from our IRA (about $12,000) to meet the ACA requirements. I made another $8000 from a small pension. This gave us almost free insurance. My Dad passed away last week and left me an Inherited IRA. He did not take his RMD this year so I will be getting an RMD of about 55,000. This will leave me owing the ACA about $7200 to pay back. I do plan on giving money away to charities in future years so I was wondering if it made sense to open a DAF and put 30 or 40 thousand in it to avoid paying the penalty to the ACA. (My thinking is that I would lower my MAGI (which is what ACA goes by) thus qualifying for the subsidy.) I totally get that I have no deductions so would only help a little bit with my Federal taxes since I would kind of be wasting my Standard deduction. Then next year I would most likely pick lower cost ACA plans or do something else entirely. Do you think this will work? Any downfalls? Thanks for your input.

personalfinance,should I run my capital gain/loss report with or without wash sales?,"Hello, an equities question -

I'm struggling to make sense of TD Ameritrade's gain/loss reports. I can run them with or without wash sale adjustments. I'm trying to figure out how much I've actually made or lost on my capital, especially after I factor in taxes.

I made money in equities in 2021, and I paid taxes on it. Accounting for wash sales, I made about 70K in capital gains (all short term - I sold everything in December). Without wash sales factored in, TD Ameritrade says I made about 50K. I do understand that I paid taxes on the first number. The taxes I paid on the capital gains, both state and federal, amounted to about 22k. I live in a high-tax state.

In 2022, I've lost money in equities. Yes, I bought back in. Accounting for wash sales, I've lost about 80K (all short term). Without wash sales factored in, TD Ameritrade says I lost about 62.5K.

I'm obviously not going to be paying capital gains taxes this year (understatement of the century). Therefore, do I care about the wash sales?

Essentially, I'm trying to figure out how much money I've lost from the beginning of 2021 to the current date. 

BTW, yes, I've learned my lesson. Index funds for the rest of my life. I'm actually kind of glad this happened to me relatively early. I thought I was a genius and invested in high growth tech stocks. I'm glad it happened now rather than later with a $1,000,000 portfolio.",finance,1663445837
personalfinance,How should I deal with the severe credit debt of my aging father with memory issues? Please help!,"**I desperately need help. TL;DR My dad is a small business owner with developing Alzhiemer's and $130k in business debt that he put on his personal credit cards. Bankruptcy does not seem like a good option as he has a house in California that I don't want him to lose. He and his doctor do not think he should move out right now, so selling it isn't an option either. How should I deal with his debt? Should I liquidate his retirement fund to pay it off? Should I take out a cash-out mortgage on his house? Or should I use my doctor's note to negotiate with the credit card companies, thus ruining his credit but getting him max savings? (This would also mean that he would not be able to get a cash-out mortgage)**

My dad, who is in his early 70s, has memory issues. I'm not exactly sure when they started, as he was long in denial. He brushed his lapses off as stress. And because there were legitimately many stressful things happening in his life I was inclined to believe him. Until I spoke to some of the people who have worked with my dad for decades and they told me they've been worried about him and that he's had trouble with accounting and keys and so on.

He has also not scored well on medical memory tests.

We live in different states. This summer, I traveled to California to help him apply for a cash-out mortgage to cover some legal bills from a stressful intrafamilial litigation over his mother’s property (not brought by him but by another relative). 

While applying for this cash out mortgage, the lender ran a credit check on my dad and said his debt to income ratio was 103%. I asked how that was possible. She then rattled off ten credit cards and the balance on each of them. It amounted to more than $135,000. Unbeknownst to me, and unbeknownst somewhat to my dad, he had nearly maxed out ten credit cards charging to them expenses from his small business. During the pandemic, his small business took a big hit, and this was compounded, I suspect, by his memory issues. Somehow he did not manage to get a PPP loan. He told me he applied and was denied. This is curious because he has an employee and several people who do routine tasks for him and he works in the Bay Area, the place with the earliest and most stringent shut-down requirements. I know many people, including freelance editors and furniture designers without any employees, who somehow got loans for $80k and more. But that's besides the point.

He was not supposed to put business expenses on his credit cards. But he loves his store, and either forgot or was blinded by that love. Most likely both. He was aware that he had outstanding balances but had no idea the size of the debt. He also believed he always made payments on time. The reality is more complicated--he usually made the minimum payments in a relatively timely fashion. These balances are just getting larger and larger. As I spent more time with him at his store, I realized he was late on payments, confused about accounting, and generally very stressed, and fearful about his diminished capacity but also in denial. 

We went to the doctor for a memory evaluation and he scored even more poorly.

To put out the immediate fire of this legal fee, I loaned my dad $40k, savings intended for my kid's education and my household emergency fund, so that he wouldn't be sued by his lawyer. 

He agreed to close his store and retire, which was very emotional for him. The problem is how to put him in an ok financial position. His wife, my mother, is dead, and apart from me, he has no other family or children. 

His credit score, surprisingly, is 700. My general thought was to wipe out as much of the debt by selling off his inventory. Then I either wanted to knock out the remaining debt by liquidating one of his retirement funds or getting a cash-out mortgage or negotiating with the credit card companies (either myself or through a credit consolidation nonprofit). What would you recommend????

His mortgage is $1780/month at an interest rate of 4.2%. He has $82k left on his mortgage. He bought his house in 1990 for $500k. It is now worth an estimated $2 million. He has not paid himself from his store in years. I think this year he maybe paid himself $5k, last year $8k. This low income makes cash-out mortgage apps hard. He works more than full-time. His only income is social security and an IRA. He began drawing from both during the pandemic. He gets $3,600/month from social security, and $1-2k from the Equitable IRA. He has three retirement accounts total--the Equitable with $44k, which he is drawing from, and another with Invesco for almost $100k, and a third that I'm currently setting up with Vanguard, which will have $110k (this is a rollover from a profit-sharing account that he set up 15 years ago, when his business was doing well). I am tempted to consolidate all of his retirement accounts into one single one at Vanguard. Is that a bad idea?? 

I spent a week inventorying the items in his store, and if he sold everything for 15% off, he would bring in $160k, 30% off would be $130k. But his store rent is $5k a month and he doesn't have the capacity to advertise, and I have a full-time job and a baby. I took a month off to help him while my husband took care of my kid, and I wasn't able to help him move very much inventory. Neither he nor I have the ability/time to list on ebay, and I'm concerned about interest rates growing. It seems like if I could just hustle harder, I would be able to find someone to research, price, and post his inventory for a cut of the proceeds, but I just don't have the bandwidth, and I feel very guilty about it. A buyer in the same industry has made an offer on all of the inventory for $60,000. It's a sizable loss, but we are leaning toward accepting because the buyer will do the work of packing and removing the items quickly. My dad could be out of his month-to-month lease next month.

That leaves him with $70k in credit card debt. And a $40k debt to me.

I asked his tax accountant and mine if I should just use his retirement fund to wipe out the debt and they both said NO because the tax penalty would be too high and you can never put that money back in. But isn't the accruing credit card interest worse??

Afraid of accruing interest rates, I used the money in his checking and savings and business savings to attack some of the credit card debt, focusing on the cards with the highest interest rates. The remaining balances are as follows:

$25,000.00 @ 18.24% 

$9,780.44 @ 13.49%

 $12,399.64 @  0% till 7/7/22, then 15.24%

$29,796.57 @ 8.99%

 $15,357.80 @ 9.97%

 $13,579.25 @ 9.99%

$5,000.00 @ unclear

**$110,913.70**

I also spoke to greenpath debt management, a nonprofit debt consolidation service that would destroy my dad's credit score but work with credit card companies to negotiate down his balances and consolidate everything into a single payment. (They charge $50 startup fee and then $35/month).

personalfinance,Can I take out loans with no credit as an American citizen who's lived abroad for the past decade?,"Hello everyone.

I left the United States when I was 18 and went to university in Europe. I'm almost 27, and I plan on returning to the United States to get some money together to finance a project I'll be working on before I go to graduate school. Right now my options are either to work my ass off and try and save enough money on the side (which might take a few years), or try and get a personal loan which I'll be able to pay back in the future, thereby getting started immediately.

I am pretty sure I have no credit because I've been living abroad, and my parents have horrible credit (they've both declared bankruptcy), so I don't think it'd be possible to get their help either. As far as assets go, I'm pretty poor. I have about $4000 or so when all is said and done, and nothing in the way of property or vehicles.

I have my doubts that I'd qualify for any loans, but to be perfectly honest, I have no idea how this system even works in the United States. I planned on saving up $50,000, but it's not possible to take out a loan for that much with no credit, is it?

Let's just neglect whether I *should* or not for a moment. How much debt could one in my position theoretically get into if they were a complete financial masochist? If I paid no heed to interest rates and all that, is it possible to get $50,000 in loans? Is it possible to get even more than that? $100,000? $200,000?

Are student loans an option for me, even if I plan on going to a foreign university and probably spending more of it on rent, visa fees, and flights, rather than tuition?

I know this sounds silly, but I would really be grateful if someone could entertain the idea, if as nothing else but a thought experiment, just so I can get an idea how this all works. I'm not *actually* trying to do something stupid like get myself mired in six figures worth of debt, but taking out a significant chunk of change actually will make some degree of financial sense given my current career trajectory.

personalfinance,"Early 30s, many questions on goals, saving for home, and managing money in a marriage","Please be aware this will be a text wall. I started typing this up as an exercise for myself to compare against the spending flowchart, and make sure I had an accurate picture in my own head. For those of you groaning at this already; yes, your assumptions based on the numbers to follow are probably correct… We are working on it. I find that discussing this type of thing and getting opinions helps me, and I figure background/numbers will help you all with context. I know there are many different points of discussion here, I thought about making multiple posts but these are really holistic questions.

Married filing jointly, ages 31 and 32

Combined base salary $185k (both make basically the same), expected bonus \~$30k. I reasonably expect these values to increase by \~ 10%/yr or more. 

We live in OR so state tax income tax is 8.75% for income over $9k

Credit score is 740 and 680. 

Minimum monthly budget just over $5k/mo, breakdown of major expenses as follows:

Rent: $2250/mo

Electric/gas/water/internet: $450/mo

Cellphones: $180/mo (I know…)

Insurance (Health+/life/auto/renters): $550

Car payment: $526/mo

Car maint: \~$100/mo (3 cars + moto and I do almost everything myself)

Student loan: $300/mo (expected, currently under pause)

Credit Card minimums (more on this later): $300/mo

Groceries: $400/mo

Misc.(dogs/clothes/etc.): $200

Random crap: way too much. 

Checking/Savings: 

“Buffer” Checking account: \~$10K running average, I try to keep it at a minimum of $8k  

Savings: $8k

Retirement:

Combined, including HSA: \~$50k 

Contributions: company Roth, %5 with 1-1 match, 6% with 0.5-1 match

Debts: \~$61k

Student loans: $27.6k (should be -$10k assuming that goes through), \~5% APR (average, multiple loans, all federal)

Car: $17.3k, 0% apr, 33 payments left. 

Credit Cards: $16K

Net worth: \~$0. Ouch. That was a painful realization.

I don’t really plan to retire early unless we get a windfall (not likely). My wife probably will if my career grows the way I hope. We do want 2 kids in the (relatively) near future.

Now on to some questions. These are pretty inter-twined/build on one another, I’m looking for opinions here because there’s probably a lot of things I’m not considering. 

1. We want to buy a home in 1-2 years, and the current going rate for what we want (5+ acres and a medium size house) is \~$700k. West of Hillsboro, OR, (west of Portland). Would we be out of our minds to consider this? Hear me out: Realistically this would take our \~$3k/mo rent/utilities to \~$5.5k/mo for mortgage/utilities/upkeep. In order to have a decent down payment in the given timeframe, we need to be putting away 2-3k/mo in savings, so could sort of see this as “reasonably within our current budget”. Also, I’m somewhat hopeful the market will come down by the time we are ready, but not banking on this.

2. Sanity check on numbers for buying a house: 5% for down payment would be $35k, let’s call it $45k for some cushion and closing costs. Also thinking another $20k in emergency funds. So realistically, minimum of $65k in the bank before making this move. Is this reasonable, or should that number be bigger? More questions on debt management below. 

3. Best place to sock away money for down payment? I’ve been putting money into Roth IRAs because then we could pull out principal to buy a house. Also, we probably don’t have long before we are over the income cap for Roth IRA. Leaving it uninvested, essentially this as a savings account with the added benefit that if we can save aggressively/have a windfall, we can just leave it in there. Basically, what was discussed in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/x6sud8/building\_an\_emergency\_savings\_account\_consider\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/x6sud8/building_an_emergency_savings_account_consider_a/). For funds beyond that amount, set a timeline and put it in CDs? 

4. Employer retirement accounts: we are making the minimum contributions to get max employer matching. Everything I’ve read says getting a loan from your 401k to buy a house is a bad idea, so with the short term goal to buy a house I don’t really want to contribute more. Thoughts?

5. Employer retirement: Roth vs traditional? We have been doing Roth, but I’m thinking we should convert to traditional as the tax savings will help us save up cash faster in the short term.

6. Debt management: big amount in CC debt, more on why further down. Floated this on balance xfer offers that give 0% APR for 18months with a 3% fee, so 2% APR (2 different cards from Wells Fargo and Discover). From everything I have seen, getting these offers is fairly easy, so one could probably keep this going for a really long time and just keep switching banks. Yes, CC debt is bad and stupid and if I screw this up, we have to pay back interest on the remaining balance at the end of the 18 months. But here is my thinking. Student loans are spread across 6 different federal loans with ranging APR, average about 5%, so if I prioritize SL payments I’m saving about half the interest costs. Similarly, mortgage rates are probably going to still be high, like \~7%, when we are ready to buy a house. It actually seems like a smart move to continue the balance xfer float method, and aggressively pay other loans. I haven’t paid SL since the pause, rather focused on paying down this CC debt for the same reasoning. The only thing I can think of is that CC debt might be counted as a bigger “black mark” against you than SL when applying for a mortgage? Having trouble finding actual information here. For what it’s worth, my CC utilization is \~15%. Also, does it make sense to hold a bigger cash cushion and maintain low interest debt? Or should we really just plan to pay off all CC and SL before buying a house?

This next part may be an overshare, but I think it’s important context. My wife and I are about to hit 4 years married; I was in school for the first 2 working part time. Outside of my 2 year stint in school, we have both worked full time for \~ 10 years. Historically, handling money together has been a big problem for us, we come from very different backgrounds and mindsets. It got to the point where she felt very judged and basically wouldn’t even discuss money with me (pretty fair, I got very upset and didn’t handle things well). The end result is the financial situation you see above. We are now talking through and working through this together. But there are still so many things we don’t agree on, and it’s really hard for me to not get frustrated. Basically, it seems like she gets the big picture, but then when it comes down to the daily nitty gritty of saving and not overspending, there’s a disconnect. She has made amazing progress in the last year by not spending on CC, and paying down the balance. However, she still casually wants to spend what I consider large amounts on things like eating out and vacations. This is what I mean by a disconnect on the nitty gritty details. 

I have done a terrible job of working on this with my wife in the past, because it’s hard for me to keep my emotions in check. I know a lot of it is because of her upbringing, it’s literally habits and mindsets, but it’s so hard not to get frustrated. I know that if we are going to be happy together, we have got to figure it out and be on the same page. Anyone in a similar situation, how the heck have you done it? And not trying to paint myself as some kind of financial genius here, I have a lot of work to do too.

This whole post started as an exercise for me of trying to document a clear picture of our finances and goals so I can talk with her more clearly about our path forward, and reference back to it in future discussions. I really think setting large goals and reviewing on a regular basis will help us both keep focused when it comes to managing spending. I’m thinking the approach will be;

1. Nail down our financial goals with respect to savings, debt payments, retirement, etc.

2. Make a tracking spreadsheet with graphs for all of the above.

3. Review it on a weekly basis together.

I'm thinking this will help make money management an ""us"" thing instead of a ""you and me"" thing. I’ve also thought about incorporating a line item in our budget/opening a savings account for “fun/vacations” as a way to control this type of spending. Thoughts? 

If you have made it all the way through this post, thank you so much for reading. I would really appreciate your input on any and all points above.",finance,1663479137

personalfinance,between a couch and a hard place,"I have a lot of debt and I'm looking for advice/financial steps. I have no family and I have been trying to survive as I go. 

Debts:
Card 1: 18% rate at $2,300
Card 2: 13.24% at $10,000
Card 3: 0% at $1,000 for a year
Total CC debt about $14,000 with variable interest rates.

I have about $65k in student loans. I know $20k will get knocked off but that's still a lot of debt. I know I can pay off the $1,000 first but does that make sense?

I moved to a new state and my auto insurance doubled, and I'm still not sure about the rest of my bills since it's my first month. Rent went from $650 to around $1240 before utilities. 

Income went from $18/hour to $65k/year both before tax. Virginia to Texas.

I'm 25 and I cook most of my own meals. It's a new city but I still like to do fun things and meet people. I meet my match in Share Purchase Plan and Retirement. 

I got a relocation bonus of close to $1,000 AFTER tax. I have NO savings and a bunch of debt. I'm a former student athlete with back problems. 

Questions:
1. I can spend most of the bonus on a great couch and buy a bed frame later, pay debt as I go? 
2. I can spend some of the bonus on an alright couch, not terrible for my back, and use the rest on one of the cards?
3. Use the entirety of the bonus on a card, and use my current bed with pillows as the couch?
4: Pay minimum on all cards, no couch, and have savings for the first time?
5: is there a formula I can input my X's and Y's into to pay off debt the fastest, so I can use disposable income on furniture?

Keep in mind that: my back got evaluated and I'm legitimately lacking in cartilage. I don't have a backup plan and I'm on my own. Used to have a 42"" vertical tho gang gang.

I also have other bills each month but these are most pressing, and I also haven't gotten the other bills in the mail yet.",finance,1663479790

Forex,What I believe to be the highest probability setup from fundamental analysis.,"Currently, I am holding a short position on equities using US30. I believe a continued bearish trend in US stocks is very likely to happen. The age of QE has ended and the Fed is on track for a historically aggressive hike path. Previously at the Jackson Hole symposium the Fed left multiple rate hikes on the table as well as hikes more often in non conventional cycles. That was the before the recent CPI release which showed that the previous rate path has yet to completely stagnate inflation. This makes a case for a 100 bp hike this Wednesday compared to the expected 75 bp hike. A larger than expected hike is almost guaranteed to force stocks lower. Given the high correlation on lower time frames between equities and almost any major pair, EUR/USD stands out as particularly weak compared to both the pound and aussie which have upcoming interest rate related releases that might turn out more dovish than expected. It wouldn't be unrealistic for EU to slide into the 0.95 realm by the end of the year. USD/JPY is a good candidate for a long position if you don't already have one, but I am being mindful of the BoJ interest rate decision this Thursday.

stocks,Wall Street is torn on whether the stock market will crash or soar 20% ahead of next week's Fed meeting. Here's where 6 experts stand.,"What do you think?   

# The Bears

**1. Ray Dalio: Expect a 20% sell-off in the stock market if rates keep rising.**

""With inflation well above what people and central banks want and the unemployment rate low, it's obvious that inflation is the targeted problem, so it's obvious that the central banks should tighten monetary policy. Everything will flow from that,"" Dalio said on Wednesday.

""I estimate that a rise in rates from where they are to about 4.5% will produce about a 20% negative impact on equity prices,"" Dalio said.

**2. Scott Minerd (Guggenheim CIO): A 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500 could happen by mid-October.**

""It's really stark to see the price-to-earnings ratio where it is... given where seasonals are, and how far out of line we are historically with where the p/e is, we should see a really sharp adjustment in prices very fast,"" Minerd said last week.

""It appears people are ignoring the macro backdrop, monetary policy backdrop, which would basically indicate that the bear market is intact. We may very well already be in a recession... with YoY core PCE now at 4.6% and S&amp;P 500 trading at \~19x, we should see stocks fall another 20% by mid-October,"" Minerd said.

**3. Jeff Gundlach (DoubleLine Capital founder): The credit market suggests both the economy and stock market are in trouble.**

""The action of the credit market is consistent with economic weakness and stock market trouble. I think you have to start becoming more bearish,"" Gundlach said on Tuesday, adding that he agrees with Scott Minerd's call that stocks can fall 20% soon.

""You always want to own stocks, but I'm a little on the lighter side...buy long-term Treasurys, because the deflation risk — in spite of the fact that the narrative today is exactly the opposite — the deflation risk is much higher today that it's been for the past two years,"" Gundlach said. Gundlach believes the Fed should hike interest rates by just 25 basis points next week.

# The Bulls

**1. Tom Lee (Fundstrat founder): Inflation has already peaked and that means you should buy stocks.**

""Even for those in the 'inflationista' camp or even the 'we are in a long-term bear' camp, the fact is, if headline CPI has peaked, the June 2022 equity lows should be durable,"" Lee said on Friday.

August's higher-than-expected CPI report ""does not mean stocks have to break below the June lows,"" Lee said, as he reiterated his view that S&amp;P 500 will rally more than 20% to new highs by year-end.

**2. Jeremy Siegel (UPenn Wharton professor): Inflation is falling and whoever wanted to get out of stocks already has.**

""It seems like everyone that wants to be out of the market is out, and everyone that wants to be tactical is short. Therefore the surprises are going to be to the upside... when everyone has sold, only the buyers are left, and the shorts are exposed,"" Siegel said on Monday.

Siegel said if the Fed says rates will be higher for longer, ""That would be a policy mistake. I think they're going to look at the economy, and I hope they understand what the statistics are and what on the ground inflation is.""

**3. Marko Kolanovic (JP Morgan Chief Global Strategist): The stock market will rally as inflation resolves itself.**

""Given the lag it takes for rate hikes to work through the system, and with just one month before very important US elections, we believe it would be a mistake for the Fed to increase risk of a hawkish policy error and endanger market stability,"" Kolanovic said on Monday.

""Our expectation that the global economy will stay out of recession, increasing fiscal stimulus, and still very low investor positioning and sentiment should thus continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, despite the more hawkish central bank rhetoric recently,"" Kolanovic said.",finance,1663496348

I did some extensive budgeting before I moved so I could be sure I wouldn't rent something above my means, and came out with about $400 left over every month for savings--yay!  Unfortunately, I just received my first pay stub, and had a couple unpleasant surprises...

First, I budgeted by month.  I'm now realizing, the months don't all split out neatly into two pay periods, so my monthly salary is actually typically lower than the number I originally planned for (there are two months a year with three pay periods).  The other problem is my Fed withholding, which is somehow twice as much as I expected it to be.  Not sure how I screwed up there, but it's definitely not helping.  

How do people usually deal with the whole pay periods vs. average monthly pay thing?  Based on two PP/month, I'm now a couple dollars in the red for ten months of the year, and then coming out $1.5k ahead for two months a year.  I don't love the idea of using that extra money to play catch-up/get ahead twice a year but I'm not sure how else to do it, especially given the next three PP month is not until December. Any advice?

(Also, if anyone has advice on how to cross check the fed withholding rate, that would also be super helpful--it feels very odd to me that it would appear to increase as much as it has).",finance,1663514501

cybersecurity,Beginner friendly security setup for sandboxes (asking for review),"I have written a simple application wrapping up very important applications that are likely to interact with the bad internet and get compromised (e.g. Firefox). It is fully written in Bash but Fedora/SELinux specific (currently?). If you are interested in the source code you may browse it by looking into the src/\*.sh.in files in the repo pasted below - those files are concatenated into a final script which is then installed on the system.

I have done so by using systemd-run and allowing only access to really necessary directories (configs and the application specific cache). To further improve isolation I am using Xephyr to spawn a new Xserver and execute the entire application specifically there.

So what I am asking you guys is to perform a somewhat review and maybe let me know some tricks on how to improve the security.

What I currently experience is the possibility to escape the specific Xserver by  the applications in the following ways. In all of those cases I do not know if that is even a bad thing:

1. Firefox can communicate with services running on the local host (e.g. syncthing web gui)
2. Telegram's notifications are displayed natively (if native notifications are enabled)
3. System tray icons are generally available (Telegram/Transmission)
4. Thunderbird must gain access to \~/.gnupg to perform decryption

I'm curious what your opinions are - will we see 4-5% interest rates on mortgages within the US in the next 2-5 years? It seems like there is no end in sight for the current rate hikes. Historically speaking, a 6-7% interest rate is still amazing. But we've become spoiled with sub 4% rates.

CryptoCurrency,Are we actually going to have a bullish October?,"Not a copium post, just my thoughts for the next month. 

So, here is where we are: 

Markets reacted violently with CPI figures for August being higher than projected. Next week we are having the FOMC meeting with a projected hike of 0.75% with some analysts speculating a 1% possibility. Markets are seemingly pricing in this over the past few days (along with the CPI reaction). 

Where we are going:

In October there is no FOMC meeting. In early November we have the elections. Historically both October and the month before the elections is bullish (data from last 50 years). 

Provided that we get 0.75% next week I am speculating that we might actually get a bullish month for a change. 

Personally I would like to take this opportunity (if it happens) to close some positions because i expect more slow bleed over the next months.

solar,New DIY Install Finished,"Just finished up a major solar project at my house that first involved reshingling the roof, building a new shed, and then installing solar. Everything was DIY and it all took me about 1.5 years. System is 44x 430 Watt QCells with IQ8A Enphase microinverters. Total cost for all materials including conduit, wiring, new electrical panel (bought a SPAN panel which was a bit pricey \~$3.5k), and all the solar equipment was about $34k. I'm in NY so after the 30% federal credit and $5k from NY, my total cost will be about $18.8k.  I just got PTO about two weeks ago, cracked 100kwh a few days ago. I'm expecting yearly production of about 21,000 kwh and the house uses about 14,000 kwh so plenty of margin. Next up is geothermal!

If you read between the lines, governments are preparing and many countries are already in the testing pilot phases of a CBDC (Central Backed Digital Currency). Of course that's bad because it won't be like the crypto we know now, it'll be programmable and able to be manipulated unlike Btc.

CryptoCurrency,What I would have done differently from 2017-2018-2019 and how it applies to (now) 2022- (summer?) 2023. Is bitcon dominance about to spike?,"I discovered bitcoin and cryptocurrency in October 2017. Every month for about a year I just kept on throwing money into it without thinking or looking at the charts.                  

I hope you guys are smarter than I was back then. If you saved up every penny you could and put it to the side, then I would recommend beginning a DCA strategy now. However, just because we are below bitcoin's fair value right now doesn't mean we're gonna be out of the woods next week or the week after that or the week after that. Basically if I had paid attention to previous bear markets (spoiler alert, I didn't go back and look at the charts) then I would have known that an 80% or more drawdown from the 20k ATH of 2017 could have been possible. I could have just saved as much cash as possible for a year and then started buying at better prices EOY 2018.                

These past few days I've been aggressively (maybe even too aggressively) buying bitcoin at every single opportunity I could below 20k as opposed to just sitting back and watching where we go from here. I might have thrown 15-20% of my dry powder at the dip below 20k we saw 24 hours ago only to go lower now.                    

I'm expecting everything to get worse for crypto and bitcoin over the next few months. We could reach some new all time low in the next two months, in which case I'm expecting the ""fastest possible recovery"" to come 4-6 months later.                

**EDIT:** My justification for the final paragraph is pretty simple. When the CPI report was released like a week ago, stock and crypto investors basically saw that inflation was not decreasing as quickly as they thought it would decrease. So, these guys thought far ahead and are speculating that the Fed is going to spike interest rates by at least 75 basis points (0.75%) while there are a few (not many) who think that a basis-point hike of 100 basis points is possible. And in the chart below, we have a basic screenshot of a poll where people are expressing what they think will be the interest rate in December of 2022 (cumulative, not a spike or raise).

stocks,"Costco, AutoZone, Lennar, Darden, and Other Stocks for Investors to Watch This Week","All eyes will be on the Federal Reserve this week, as the central bank’s policy committee meets to consider further interest-rate increases. A handful of major companies will report earnings this week, including AutoZone on Monday and General Mills and Lennar on Wednesday. On Thursday, Costco Wholesale, Darden Restaurants, and Accenture all report.

The week’s main event will be the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day meeting, which ends on Wednesday. Futures pricing suggests the greatest odds of a third-straight rate hike of 0.75 percentage point. The Bank of Japan also announces a monetary policy decision on Thursday. There’s no change in interest rates expected there.

Economic data out this week will feature several indicators of the health of the U.S. housing market. The National Association of Home Builders releases its Housing Market Index for September on Monday, the Census Bureau will report housing starts for August on Tuesday, and the National Association of Realtors reports existing-home sales for August on Wednesday.

Other data will include the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index for August on Thursday and S&amp;P Global’s Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers’ Indexes for September on Friday.

# Monday 9/19

AutoZone reports fourth-quarter fiscal-2022 results.

**The National Association** of Home Builders releases its Housing Market Index for September. Economists forecast a 48.5 reading, about even with the August data. The index has fallen every month this year and in August breached the key break-even measure of 50 for the first time since May of 2020.

# Tuesday 9/20

**The Census Bureau** reports new residential construction statistics for August. Expectations are for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.45 million privately owned housing starts, matching the July figure.

# Wednesday 9/21

**The National Association of Realtors** reports existing-home sales for August. The consensus estimate is for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 million existing homes sold, about 100,000 fewer than in July. General Mills and Lennar release earnings.

Salesforce and W.W. Grainger host investor days.

**The Federal Open Market** Committee announces its monetary-policy decision. Just two weeks ago, Wall Street was debating whether the FOMC would raise the federal-funds rate by 50 or 75 basis points. After another strong jobs report and a hotter-than-expected print for the August consumer price index, a three-quarters of a percentage point interest-rate hike seems all but assured. That would bring the fed-funds rate to 3.0%-3.25%. Traders are even pricing in a 25% chance that the central bank will raise its key short-term rate by a full percentage point, which would be the largest move in nearly four decades.

# Thursday 9/22

Accenture, Costco Wholesale, Darden Restaurants, FactSet Research Systems, and FedEx hold conference calls to discuss quarterly results. BallCorp. and Qualcomm hold investor days.

**The Bank of Japan** announces its monetary-policy decision. The central bank is expected to maintain its ultralow interest-rate policy and keep its target rate unchanged at negative 0.1%, as it has been since early 2016. The dovish BOJ, in contrast to the hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve, has sunk the yen to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since 1998.

**The Conference Board** releases its Leading Economic Index for August. The consensus call is for a 0.1% month-over-month increase after a 0.4% decline in July. The index has fallen for five consecutive months, indicating that the risk of a recession is rising in the near term.

# Friday 9/23

**S&amp;P Global releases** both its Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers’ indexes for September. Economists forecast a 51 reading for the Manufacturing PMI and a 45.3 for the Services PMI. This compares with 51.5 and 43.7, respectively, in August.

CryptoMarkets,How one should focus on surviving crypto winter?,"The term 'crypto winter' is the equivalent of bearish sentiments in a traditional trading market. During such a winter, prices for many crypto tokens dip and stay uncharacteristically low for an extended period.

Take Bitcoin (BTC) prices as an example. Its valuation started dipping in January 2022 and hasn't managed to cross the $22,000 mark as of early July 2022.

Several factors can contribute to such crashes. For instance, the 2022 crash happened due to a combination of a hike in interest rates, irrational investor behaviour and the Tera (LUNA) crash. 

Here's how it all went down:

* **Tera (LUNA) crash:** Despite hosting two native stablecoins, the Terra network detached itself from the US dollar. That brought LUNA and UST valuations extremely low. To counter this price drop, Terraform Labs decided to sell its entire BTC reserves. However, the company failed to anticipate that selling such vast BTC reserves would lower BTC prices. Investment platforms delisted LUNA and UST shortly after, but the damage had already occurred.
* **US Federal Government’s Interest Hike:** The US Federal Reserve decided to hike interest rates to control inflation. In response, investors began to sell their tokens to avoid aggressive strategies such as slow spending and increased debt rates. This caused the market to bleed even further.
* **Irrational investor behaviour:** Investors continued to panic due to the events mentioned above. Fear and impulsive market behaviour manifested themselves in the large-scale selling of tokens. 

It didn’t help that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms such as the Celsius Network imposed restrictive transaction policies. While the goal was to control impulsive investor behaviour, the network failed to explain its actions adequately. This only led to another wave of panic.

Now, surviving  such a ‘winter’ can be easy if you rely on long-term investment avenues like a [Crypto Investment Plan](https://blog.coindcx.com/product-features/crypto-investment-plan-cip/) (CIP), Dollar cost averaging, HODL, and more.",cryptocurrency,1663583807

economy,Crypto Market Update (week 37),"C**rypto and equities markets finished the last week with losses, preparing for this week’s FED announcements.** Crypto markets dropped heavily with Bitcoin down by over 10% compared to the previous week, closing at 19.419 on Sunday. ETH experienced the biggest slump by almost 25%.

The Merge had successfully taken place on September 15th, 2022, at 08:42:42 GMT+2 at a Block #15.537.393, marking the full transition of the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which will cut energy consumption by about 99.95% compared to the PoW consensus mechanism. However, the successful upgrade had not fuelled the Ether’s price further up. Instead, the price remained flat at the Merge event and finished the week down at 1.335. Equities, on the other hand, dropped by around 5% with NASDAQ closing at 11.448 and S&amp;P closing at 3.873 last Friday.

**The FED is expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75% this week.** The consumer price index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on last Tuesday, increased by 0.1% in August, ending at 8.3%, down from 8.5% in July 2022, but still at four-decade highs. Headline inflation rose 0.1% month over month, even with falling petrol prices.

Core inflation rose 0.6% month over month, translating to an annual increase of 6.3%, up from 5.9% recorded during the previous period. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a decline of 0.1% for overall inflation, with a rise of 0.3% for core inflation. Moreover, Economists polled by Reuters forecast the CPI fell by 0.1% month-on-month in August, resulting in 8.1% for August 2022, down from 8.5% a month earlier.

Despite the drop in gasoline prices, the rise in core inflation fuelled speculation that the FED will have to step up with further rate increases on its next meetings. According to Refinitiv, **the new expectations point the federal funds rate to a new target range of 3.80% to 4.20% by end of 2022, with a peak of 3.94% – 4.45% around March 2023.**

Overall, the crypto market sentiment (measured by Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index) continues to stand at **21/100, indicating Extreme Fear**, compared to a month ago when the Index stood at 29/100. The total crypto market cap had dropped by almost 10%, crossing below the $1 trillion mark. ETH dominance slightly dropped to 18% (from 20.5%) and Bitcoin went slightly up to 39.4%. As we had pointed out in our previous week’s macro analysis, the ETH Merge was a typical buy-the-rumour-sell-the-news event. The Protocol’s technical upgrade had already been priced in.

**WATCH OUT FOR:** The next monetary policy meetings are scheduled for September 20-21st, 2022 for the FED and October 27th, 2022, for the ECB. The next US CPI release for September 2022 is scheduled for October 13th, 2022. The next US GDP update will be released on September 29th, 2022, followed by October 27th. 2022.",finance,1663595821

We have to relocate in 3 months and I am trying to figure out if I should buy a house at the new location or rent for the first few months.

\-House Cost: $600,000

\-Interest per month on 3% rate: 1500 per month

\-Interest per month on 6% rate: $3000 per month

I believe the house is priced for 3% rate from few months ago but they are selling it when the actual mortgage rate is 6%.

investing,"Bond ETF valuation mechanics not behaving, any ideas why?","I have held a long-term option short position with TLT for a few years now, expecting that it would take a hit when interest rates rise since bonds held would need to be discounted once interest rates change significantly.

I've looked at the assets and value of what they've disclosed for the fund in the published documentation, and after the first interest rate change, it should have dropped significantly. 

I waited, and it didn't, despite the prospectus claiming to rebalance regularly with the index.

Since then, there have been several other increases in the default interest rate, and the fund hasn't moved, or appeared to re-balance these changes at all.

Any ideas why this Bond ETF hasn't dropped? 

The assets the fund holds appear to me to be worth at least 30-40% less than the current market value. Given the interest rate hikes, but the ETF market price hasn't been impacted at all.

I'd like your take on this since it appears I must be missing something.

gaming,Where should I purchase indie games between the options listed below?,"Hello everyone. So lately I've been needing to budget and don't think I have the capability to purchase any new hardware for my needs, both in work and in personal entertainment. To that end I've been thinking about where it would be best for me to purchase indie games moving forward.  

PC via Steam- currently have a Surface Studio and Surface Book 2, and have been facing technical difficulties with my computers. However, I recognize that any games that I get on Steam would be potentially playable on any future computer. The thing is that I mainly use my computers for work as a freelance artist, and I feel like this would compromise my systems, as my computers tend to get very finicky whenever I have games loaded onto them. 

Nintendo Switch- has the most exclusives that I'm looking forward to playing and also enjoy the option of it being portable. However, I recognize that the device is very under-powered and that games on it may not be able to run as well as on other platforms. Also am uncertain if any games I get digitally for this device would be able to carry over onto any future consoles. 

PlayStation 4- has been my go to system for the longest time and has a large catalog of digital and physical games that I enjoy. I feel confident that any indies I get for this device would be able to run smoothly. However, I also recognize that the PS4's days are numbered, and that the controversy around Sony lately could put the console brand in jeopardy. There also aren't too many games for PS5 out at this time that really have me interested in the system, so I can't say for sure how I feel about my library being future proofed in the PlayStation ecosystem. 

While I've been in this state of mind, I've also wondered how it would be best for me to approach games in general. I have been getting games on Steam at dirt cheap prices for the longest time even when I couldn't run them on any computers out of the belief that I would play them in the future. However, I'm beginning to think this approach may be wrong and that I should try to enjoy the games that I can on the systems I have in the present, even if they may break down and be unplayable in the years ahead. I could still try to get them cheap on Steam later on as a backup, but I wonder if it'd be better to try and enjoy them on consoles first. 

Any thoughts on the matter would genuinely be helpful for me. Thank you.",technology,1663602359

personalfinance,Someone fradulently tried to charge my debit card AND successfully logged into my online banking account. What should I do?,"Edit: it was a scam call. Remember to always hang up and call your bank through a verified number !

Here in the run down:

Scammers called me on SPOOFED number that MATCHES the number on the back of my card. (Even if the number looks right, please hang up and called back). It was the RIGHT 800 NUMBER.

I realize that it's really hard to do what they claimed they did. So I call the correct 800 number. 


I speak with bank rep and they confirm they didn't NOT call me. They give me slightly incorrect information also confusing me. I am done with them, but I panic because the number are the same.

I also get confused because the outgoing call to the right DCU number and the incoming calls from the scammers are the same in my caller ID. At the same time I was calling DCU, the scammer is trying to intiate the transfer and steal my money. *I'm guessing they had been trying to transfer money out (my bank doesn't support Zelle), once they saw I was online with the rep and likely getting some emails, they rushed to try to transfer money*

So now I'm panicking thinking I was calling the scammers, and they were able to take more action against my account. I call the NON 800 number and speak to a rep and he guides me through the process of resetting all my information and cancelling the outgoing transfer. It was a coincidence that the scammer were trying to get into my account while I called the legitimate representatives

--------

The bank called me and intercepted the charges. My account got frozen since they successfully logged into my banking account. They made three charges that were all blocked. They were all in a state different from mine.

I use my credit card 99% of the time, and I use a password manager/unique passwords for all my accounts.

investing,Why recession is the friend of the long-term investor?,"We are in the second half of 2022 and the economy’s outlook is 180 degrees opposite to what it was one year back. There is an understandable fear of a looming global recession. A downturn directly affects the livelihood and the standard of living, so it's natural to feel a little scared. Many millions face the real threat of financial struggles that may last for years. The well-off investors are on the edge of their seats too as their portfolios bleed red.

However, if you don’t live paycheck-to-paycheck and have some financial cushion, it’s helpful to remember that a recession can be a boon for your investments, especially if you invest in quality businesses for the long term.

There are two reasons for this:

**1) A great business is a better bet against the recession**

Let me illustrate this point with the help of an example about the fate of two businesses in the 1980s. This one is from the traditional farming industry and it’s very instructive.

John Deere and International Harvester were the top players in North America's farming equipment market in the 1950s and 60s. By the early 1970s, John Deere had emerged as a stronger business because of better products and prudent financial management. Compared to International harvester, its profit margins were higher (14% vs 8%) and its debt ratio was lower (31% vs 44%).

Both companies were growing fast in the 50s and 60s, but things changed quickly during the recession the of 1970s. The US entered a period of higher interest rates that led to a sharp decline in demand and net incomes.

International Harvester had huge debts. When the farmer demand plummeted, its thin margins didn’t generate enough cash to service those debts. Within a matter of 3 years from 1979-1982, its net worth declined by about 99% from $2.2B to $23M. It tried restructuring the debts, but could not succeed and finally became defunct in 1985. The recession literally destroyed the business.

John Deere’s story played out entirely differently. It was not immune to the downturn either. Its earnings declined and growth slowed during the recession, but it weathered the storm because it had better margins and lower debt. In 1981, it even raised from equity markets that it used to build extra capacity and expand internationally. It quickly filled the gap left open by International Harvester, and by 1990, it had become the largest producer of farming equipment in the world. Its stock price has grown by 35x since then.

This is not an isolated story. There are ample examples across industries to show that great businesses come out stronger after a recession. When things go south, they too struggle just like everyone else. Their earnings are not impressive because there is low demand across the board. But they use their competitive advantages to stay afloat. Under the hood, they gain market share even as the competition gets decimated. When the tide turns, like it always does, they come back stronger. They capture the soaring demand while commanding a larger share of the market.

This brings us to the second reason why recessions are doubly beneficial for patient long-term investors:

**2) You reduce your risks and increase return potential because everything is available at a discount**

Consider the current market situation we are in right now. As liquidity dries up and Fed continues to raise interest rates, investors are withdrawing money from the market. The prices of most technology stocks have dropped anywhere from 30% to 90%. S&amp;P 500 has corrected by over 20% from its peak in less than 12 months.

While it doesn’t feel good to watch your wealth shrink, this is a better time to find bargains for new investments. Of course, this does not mean that everything is available at a discount or below its fair price. But it does mean that there are more buying opportunities than what existed a year or so back.

The purchase price is one of the biggest determinants of your future returns. And a recession hands you a rare opportunity to turn the risk-reward ratio in your favor.

**What does this mean for long-term investors?**

There are two key implications for the long-term investor: 1) Do the homework to identify strong businesses because they are better bets against recession, and 2) Remember that recession is a much better time to buy stocks. You take less risk and have a larger upside.

I have said nothing new or groundbreaking in this post. I intend to only remind the readers to not lose perspective when there is so much noise all around. If anything, you should feel more confident in making new investments now.

Needless to say that none of this matters if the recession brings financial hardships. It may very likely get worse before it gets better. And recessions can last a very long time. But if you are fortunate that your life won't turn upside down, take advantage of some opportunities that Mr.Market provides.

These times might feel gloomy and it’s important to remain cautious, but there are also reasons to be optimistic if you are a long-term investor.

personalfinance,Buying vs continuing to rent?,"Hi all,
I keep debating this question over and over in my head, so I’d like to get some outside opinions on this topic (especially with mortgage interest rates increasing).

I (29F) am in a good position financially—no student loans, no other debt of any kind, stable employment/positive long term career outlook, credit score of ~790, $55k annual income for just me, Roth IRA contribution is maxed out, employer 401K is optimized to get the best matching rate, savings account is built up decently well, so all my boxes are checked in those regards. If my (29F) partner and I get married, we agree that we want a courthouse ceremony, and we are both adamantly childfree, so wedding/child expenses are not factors in my future financial plans.

I’ve felt for several years that owning a house is the next personal goal I want to achieve, but I keep going back and forth on whether I really want to own a house or if I’d rather keep renting. I moved a lot as a kid (military) so I grew up in rented homes and that’s what I’m used to. My parents now own a home in a different state than where I live that I will eventually inherit since I am an only child (that’s a long way down the road though). I’m for the most part comfortable with renting, but I feel conflicted due to the popular advice that buying a house is the best possible financial decision you can make long term because equity, renting is just throwing money away, etc. 

However, I’m hesitant to buy because it’s a huge commitment, a huge amount of money, and I don’t have the skills to perform upkeep/repairs on a house. Additionally, while I’m comfortable with the area I currently live in and anticipate being here for 5-10 more years at least, I don’t love it. Basically, it’s just okay to me. 

The reasons I would want to own a home are because of how heavily it’s recommended to do so from a financial standpoint and because of me and my partner’s concerns about winding up with a crappy/homophobic landlord (we live in a relatively conservative area). That being said, though, we’re equally concerned about buying a house only to come into contact with homophobic neighbors, contractors, trades specialists (electricians, plumbers, etc.), as well as the difficulty we anticipate in managing upkeep and repairs ourselves since both of us work full time and are usually busy on the weekends. Plus, with mortgage rates and home prices the way they are, I have to question how worth it it would be to buy when the current landscape suggests it’s not the greatest investment.

Also, in my area, the difference between renting vs/ buying in terms of monthly payments isn’t really different (both would be between $1000-$1500) so there’s that.

If anyone could provide some perspective on my situation and help me out with analyzing the pros/cons of renting vs buying, I’d greatly appreciate it.",finance,1663614666
investing,When will deleveraging end?,"There are a lot of reasons why interest rates can affect the price of equities - two big ways are a) increasing the cost of debt for companies and b) increasing the cost of margin debt for investors. I'm not a fan of trying to time the bottom the bottom of equities given how random day-to-day changes are, but I do wonder if it is more reasonable to estimate the lower range of variation for margin debt since, collectively across firms, it is a straitforward loss calculation independent of specific stocks. You'll probably not be surprised to learn that we're currently in a [de-leveraging part of the cycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/LVTA/master/Plots/lvta_total.jpg?).nThe best way to look at margin debt is to familiarize yourself with [FINRA-compliant organizations](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics): 

&gt; Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4521(d), FINRA member firms carrying margin accounts for customers are required to submit, on a settlement date basis, as of the last business day of the month, the following customer information:

&gt; * the total of all debit balances in securities margin accounts; and
&gt; * the total of all free credit balances in all cash accounts and all securities margin accounts

You can find a full primer on the leverage cycle [here](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/648285). The idea is that (some of) the price of many equities may be driven not by fundamentals (gasp) but instead by margin. As interest rates go up, so too does the cost of margin, which then requires big margin traders (and specifically FINRA-compliant firms) to sell positions. As selling pressure increases, equity prices drop. 

For non-margin investors, this represents a great opportunity. The fundamentals (always do your homework) on a equity might not change much, but the price of the equity drops simply because large margin investors can't hold onto all their positions. Which means the ideal time for non-margin investors to invest is at the bottom of the leveraging cycle when the price is likely to go up as margin-holding firms buy back in.

Measured as a ratio, the following major market movements saw the following debt:capital ratio changes:

* Dot Com: 1.9 -&gt; 0.75 (60% drop) from 01/2000 to 09/2002
* Great Recession: 1.2 -&gt; 0.65 (46% drop) from 06/2007 to 08/2008
* COVID Crash: 1.7 -&gt; 1.15 (33% drop) from 12/2019 to 04/2020
* Post-COVID Inflation: 2.2 -&gt; 1.7 (23% drop) from 08/2021 to 07/2022*

The list of 4 above are the largest movements in the past 25 years, with half of major leverage changes in the past two and a half years. Note that the last one has an asterisk (*) because it isn't over yet. The big question for retail investors is this: how much more de-leveraging from FINRA-compliant firms do we expect? This question does depend on interest rate changes expected in the future, but it also isn't completely divorced from the deleveraging that has already happened.",finance,1663616686
personalfinance,Should I buy a house now or should I rent for a year?,"Before I get to the question at hand, I'll provide a little backstory. Currently 26 with a stable income job working from home in the Tech field. Moved back into my parents house for a little over a year already but I need to move out. Rent would be around 1400 a month if i rented or if I bought a house right now, my mortgage would be about 1900. I can afford it but is it worth spending that high of a mortgage right now. 

Back to the question, The market right now is crazy with houses still really high and interest rate in the 6 percent which is really high. My thoughts is that if i wait a year, the housing market will drop at least 5 perfect or even more since inventory is staying more on the market and house affordability is getting really low. If the housing market even dips around 5 percent within a year then I will be saving more money to rent for a year then to buy a house right now. My thoughts is that is that rent would be 16k for the year that I wont get back or loose about 28k on a house that could loose value in the same one year mark. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I take the risk and still buy a house right now even though houses and interest rate are high now and take the loss if the house i do buy looses value or go rent an apartment for a year while patently wait if the market goes down?

A Review of Asset-Backed Securities.,"In January of 2022, shortly after the Federal Reserve announced they were going to raise rates and halt QE to combat/adjust for inflation, a bitter reaction in the markets was seen. Stocks tumbled, marking the beginning of a downtrend that continues to this day. 

A lesser-known effect is the collapse of CDO/CLO asset-backed securities issuance (US ABS Issuance). In fact, very few have taken notice of this, let alone the implications.

personalfinance,Paying off Parents' Mortgage,"I'd like to pay off $70k mortgage on parents' home which is worth about $200k. House is in CT. They are early 60s and relatively healthy. The interest rate is stupid and I'd probably save them $1k per month with no principal/interest mortgage payment. I think doing this would make retirement feasible for them.

Unfortunately, I can't afford to outright give the $70k. I could potentially pay off the mortgage in exchange for being able to sell the house in 25-30 years, hopefully for somewhere in the mid $200ks. I want them to be able to live in the house for their lives, rent free. But, l'd need legal certainty that I wouldn't lose my ""investment"" when they pass away. 

I am consulting with an estate planning attorney soon and I'd like to do my homework first. I'm interested in any ideas. Here are mine so far:

1. Pay off mortgage and they convey the property to an irrevocable trust. Could the trust provide for my right to sell the house upon their death? While they couldn't sell because they'd have no control, could they rent the home, collect rent proceeds, and then use the proceeds to pay rent elsewhere? It's unclear if they want to live in the home forever.

2. Pay off mortgage and they convey property to me. Would this count as income for me? Could I then convey the property to an LLC that I could use to rent them the property? If they became indigent, could the LLC rent them the house in exchange for section 8 rental assistance?

3. Pay off mortgage, they retain ownership. They give me a mortgage for $250k, with no monthly payments, and balance is due upon their death. I record the mortgage into first lien position. Provided that property taxes are always paid, could anyone or any entity jump ahead of my lien position and jeopardize my investment?

Maybe I'm totally off base. Just trying to brainstorm ways to make this work. I'd really appreciate any advice, thanks!",finance,1663637220
ethereum,Where it all ends,"So the SEC thinks that eth is us jurisdiction, because the US has the greatest density of node, i.e the majority vs other country

They would lie or say anything or do anything to get this outcome regardless, it is about US nexus which is how US law works, it's incrementalism for them to do what their agenda is. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have to understand where this ends and what they want.

They want to imprison people who don't register their smart contracts, who don't force kyc on the smart contract level, and when that fails, which it will, they will federally mandate Coinbase and the others to freeze funds that are deposited with a chain history linking to the non US nexus white labled smart contract. They're going to fully illegalize mixing and normalize the freezing of funds without clear chain history.

Yet so many of you are in denial. 

They have no other way to put an end to US citizens using mixers, monero, and so forth other than the nuclear option, and no way to enforce Banking regs and CFTC and SEC regs other than the nuclear option, i.e, de facto illegalizing non transparent chain history, they need to see which smart contract you interacted with so coinbase can freeze or return funds, the writing is on the wall.

CryptoCurrency,"Where I see the crypto market going as of today, 9/19/2022!","The biggest question I’m seeing on Twitter is if the bottom is in? On June 18, 2022 (happens to also be my birthday) we saw Bitcoin see a new local low of \~$17K, down 75% from its all time high of $69K. 

So the big question is, will we see Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market below $17K again or will we see Bitcoin never return to these levels and over time get to a new all time high?

First I want to see if there are any similarities to the previous Bitcoin bear market when we went from $19.7K on 12/17/17 to about $3K in December 2018. 

If you look at Bitcoin’s historical chart, you find something oddly coincidental. On June 18, 2018, Bitcoin’s price was $5,700 which was \~71% drop from its all time high of $19.7K. Then from June 18, 2018 to November 17, 2018, Bitcoin mainly traded sideways between $5,700 and $7,500. 

Then on November 17, 2018, Bitcoin capitulated from $6,500 down to $3,000. 

I remember this time very vividly. From January 2018 until June 2018, Bitcoin was simply in free fall without being able to establish some kind of bottom or support. Then from June 2018 to November 2018, Bitcoin finally was creating a stable support level between $5.7K and $7.5K. During this time, I thought to myself, “the bottom must be in” and like many other investors I started buying a lot of crypto using all the dry powder I had available. 

That drop to $3K sobered me up for months which made me unable to make a purchase at those lower levels for months.

This time feels exactly the same to me but at the same time, maybe things are different?

Here are my reasons why the bottom is not in:

### Why the bottom is NOT in:

1. Read above. 
2. Historically, Bitcoin never recovered this fast from the bubble bursting, so the people that say “the bottom is in”, they’re also saying the most dangerous words in all of finance and investing, “this time is different”. Which are the exact words that were told to me in Q4 2021 when Bitcoin hit $69K and we were heading to $100K (well that never happened). 
3. The trend is your friend until the end. The truth is we have been in a downward trend for over 9 months, why suddenly will we see a reversal when the macroeconomic picture looks worse than ever which leads me to my 4th point.
4. “Don’t Fight The Fed!” Wether we like it or not, everything is tied to interest rates. Interest rates are the cost of capital which is inversely related to the valuation of assets. Hence why the stock and real estate market goes down when interest rates rise. I personally do not see crypto or any asset class reversing until the Fed stops increasing interest rates. 
5. Low Sell Volume. Usually when we make a bottom in Bitcoin, we see a massive increase in selling volume. In 2018, when we dropped from $6.5K down to $3K, we saw massive selling volume. If you compare that selling volume to the volume we saw when BTC dropped from $30K to $17K in 2022, it was only half of the capitulation volume in 2018. 
6. Historically Bitcoin’s price falls between 80–85% from its all time high which implies Bitcoin’s low is around $10K — $14K. In my opinion, we are 1 capitulation away from hitting the target. 
7. % of the overall BTC supply held at a loss — in previous bear markets at least 60% of the Bitcoin bought were being held at a loss. Today, that number is about 52%. And to get to 60%, it would require Bitcoin to go to \~$10K. 
8. This one is from Willy Woo (go follow him). Long-term (LTH) and short-term (STH) holders. Normally, at the bottom, STHs have a lower cost basis than LTHs. This means that STHs paid less for their coins than LTHs, the latter defined as those hodling BTC for 155 days or more. Right now, the LTHs still have a lower cost basis than the STH. This would change if Bitcoin went down more and we saw an increase in accumulation. 
9. Lastly, the sentiment on twitter and other social media is too rosy. Everyone is still sharing their 100x crypto gems and people are still interested in discussing the next crypto they should buy. I remember the bear market of 2018–2020. It was all doom and gloom, no one wanted to talk about crypto anymore. Even CNBC took the BTC ticker off of the screen once BTC fell off a cliff. 

### There’s a good possibility I’m wrong which is why if you look at my previous post you can see that the best strategy historically is to dollar cost average (especially when you start to DCA when prices are 66% or more down from their highs).",cryptocurrency,1663641109

CryptoMarkets,Crypto market's current scenario,"The crash of the crypto market in May paved the way for a continuous bearish trend. There were numerous reasons behind the advent of crypto winter like recession, Russia Ukraine war, soaring interest rates set in motion by the Fed, 40-year low inflation.

However, within a few months, crypto is on the way to recovery from the slump. Despite facing high-profile company bankruptcies like Voyager and Celsius, the crypto tokens are standing firm.

Some technical developments in the blockchain and crypto landscape could possibly help reverse the downward trend. Ethereum’s final Merge called Paris changed the PoW into a PoS network making a historic mark in the books of crypto development. Another important event, Cardano Vasil hard fork will enhance the network’s overall performance.

As far as the absolute recovery is in question, the crypto specialists predict the tokens rising up in the [next 2-3 years](https://coindcx.com/blog/cryptocurrency/top-crypto-news-why-is-the-crypto-market-crashing-today-19-september-2022/).",cryptocurrency,1663671030
CryptoCurrency,"Now that the merge has completed, there isn't much good news on the horizon for Crypto.","Now that the merge has completed, there is little good news on the horizon for Crypto. For those looking to enter the crypto market now or add to their stack, there may be benefit in waiting for prices to drop further.

What's the argument for this?

Firstly the obvious. We are dealing with global inflation, supply issues due to the war in Ukraine, China still pursuing zero covid and tanking their growth. All of which are not showing any signs of resolving anytime soon. Unless the macro economic environment improves soon, things are not looking good for crypto.

Secondly Russia is in the process of cutting gas off to Europe in the lead in to winter. Things here in Germany are quite scary. There is genuine fear that households and industries that rely heavily on gas (which is most of the country) will simply have to turn off or ration gas to stay afloat. With industries unable to operate at their full capacity this will obviously have a flow on effect to poor economic growth.

Finally our world leaders are hell bent on driving interest rates up and up until it forces a global recession. Yes they have to do this to combat inflation but when people have less money to spend unfortunately crypto being a discretionary speculative asset class is the first to go.

So it might be worth waiting before sinking more money into crypto.",cryptocurrency,1663671965
stocks,Help me understand - how does raising interest rates bring down inflation,"I'm trying to understand how raising interest rates brings down CPI inflation. What is the *precise* mechanism (or mechanisms) that make this happen?

I am aware of the explanation ""higher rates slow down economic activity"" but I find it too vague and too simplistic and, whenever I try to work through a concrete scenario, I tend to reach a more nuanced conclusion.

Here's just one example: higher interest rates causes higher mortgage rates causing less people to buy home causing less new homes being built causing less demand for building materials and labor causing lower materials / labor prices causing a lower CPI. So: higher interest rates, lower CPI.

At the same time, people have to live somewhere, so if they are not buying homes, they must be renting. So, higher interest rates cause higher mortgage rates causing people to prefer renting to buying a home, causing a higher demands for rents, causing higher rents, causing a higher CPI. Higher interest rates, higher CPI.

Is there a detailed explanation somewhere about the causal link between interest rates and CPI inflation?",finance,1663672376

# [Stock futures dip with Fed set to kick off September meeting on Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/19/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Tuesday as Wall Street looked to build on a modest rebound ahead of another rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.3%, and those for the Nasdaq 100 traded 0.5% lower.
*****
&gt; The Federal Open Markets Committee kicks off its September meeting on Tuesday, and the central bankers are expected to announce a 0.75 percentage point rate hike on Wednesday. Stocks have tumbled in recent weeks as comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and an unexpectedly hot August consumer price index report caused traders to prepare for even higher rates until inflation cools.
*****
&gt; “I think last week a lot of the work was done to reset interest rate expectations,” said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
*****
&gt; “The momentum in equity markets is to the downside. … Until we establish that pattern of lower [inflation] readings, it’s going to be hard to reverse that elevated uncertainty and volatility that we are seeing,” Kourkafas added.
*****
&gt; During a choppy trading session on Monday, stocks rose in the afternoon to snap a two-day losing streak and claw back some of their recent losses. The Dow rose 197 points, or about 0.6%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained roughly 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively.
*****
&gt; However, after the market closed on Monday, Ford announced that supply chain issues would cost the automaker an extra $1 billion in the third quarter. Shares fell nearly 5% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors will get a fresh look at the housing market on Tuesday morning with the August reports for housing starts and building permits.

So i stick that money in a Roth and hope for a decent bit of growth

If he takes federally backed student loans there is no interest while he's in school  and If I  turn 59.5 before he graduates I can pay off the loan from my IRA with no penalties.

When US investors **lend** money to the government, FED gives them a interest rate on that. This is supposed to help slowing down inflation.

**How is it supposed to slowdown inflation?**

When they rise the interest rate, it kinda of ""**freezes**"" the economy because it's harder to borrow money from. It will make people think twice about their purchases and hence, inflations goes down.

* **WINS** \- People who **LEND** money to the government. As rates are higher, people will recieve better interest from the money they lend.
* **LOSE** \- People who actually need to **borrow** money from Uncle Sam.

**What will happen tomorrow, what's the projection**?

The general opinion is a **0.75%** increase **BUT** it might be higher, and if it rises by a whole **1%,** all markets will take a hit from it, specially one as volatile as CRYpto.

If you truly believe that - you would never read stocks news or look at economic data. The very fact that you’re in a finance subreddit - I think - is a tell that you don’t actually believe that and are just looking for reassurance. 

It’s almost a paradox. The fact that you are reading finance and Econ related things, implies you do - to a certain degree - disagree with the dogma. 

Like when some hippy says “all generalizations are wrong” - being completely obvious to the fact that they are, in fact, making a generalization with that statement. 

Im not a perma bear. I’m not a perma bull. Stocks are crashing and real interest rates are still negative. Imagine what happens when rates go up in a meaningful way?

CryptoCurrency,What if Fed believes the inflation has indeed peaked and there is no need to hike rates? Would that end bear market?,"There is general belief and consensus that Fed is going to increase rates by another 0.75% this week and markets are already reacting to that. Dow is down 500 already. It's really bad for capital markets and lending and borrowing will become more painful. Some people are claiming that it can push US into a painful deflation that will be nightmare to fix (I personally don't believe - fixing part).

Now the alternate scenario - what if Fed believes that the inflation has indeed peaked and there is no need for drastic measures i.e don't increase the rate at all or let's say may be they increase it by 0.25%. If the legendary President Biden is right that inflation is done, pandemic is over - then limiting the rate hike to 0.25% or not increasing at all are not bad tactics to ease the economy.

If this alternative scenario plays out, what would that mean for the market? Would that end the bear market for crypto? Crypto will start to rally back? Curious to hear everyone's thoughts?",cryptocurrency,1663697732
personalfinance,Rent out or sell home,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice. Throwaway account just to be safe.

Background: I purchased a home for $370k in December 2020 with 10% down with a mortgage at 2.75% interest. I still have about $319k left on the mortgage and monthly payments are about $1,650. I plan on moving about 8 hours away from my current city within the next 6 months, I'm trying to decide which is the better option: to keep my house and rent it out or just sell it.

Renting option: I'm confident I could rent out the home for $2,500+ a month, but since I'll be moving so far away I'd need to hire a property management company to handle everything which would cut into the positive cashflow. For simple budgeting, I figure I'd profit about $500 a month after management fees and taxes. I've never been a landlord or done any real estate investing, so this would all be new to me and I'd definitely have some stress about renting out a fairly expensive house. The risk of property damage or bad tenants is there, but I'm sure I'd get comfortable with it eventually. There would also be additional ongoing maintenance fees that I'd have to budget for.

Selling option: The house is currently worth about $500k. After costs of getting the house ready to sell, closing costs, and taxes (this has been my primary residence for only about 15 months) I estimate I'd come out of the sale with about $100k cash. This would definitely help with the down payment for my new home, especially with interest rates so high right now, the more I can put down the better. But I am very hesitant to give up my existing 2.75% mortgage. Another positive of selling, is I wouldn't have any stress around being a land lord, but I would miss out on any additional appreciation in the home value.

TLDR: should I rent out my home for around $500 a month extra positive cash-flow or sell it for about $100k profit and not stress about being a land lord?",finance,1663697957

gaming,"It feels like folks have forgotten that roleplaying, even in a video game, still takes some degree of effort on the player’s part","I won’t say anything about the quality of any recent RPGs. There’s good, there’s bad, everything has its own strengths and weaknesses. Everything related to game development is inherently limited by time and budget, and while expecting a minimum is reasonable, a single game can’t do everything.

With that in mind, players still have to put *some* effort into crafting their own story. Not just the actions presented by the game, but filling in the blank or idle spaces as well. Instead, it seems like people expect everything to be spoon-fed to them - not a single moment is allowed to be dull if it can be helped. Time management is practically nonexistent outside of forced limits, and exploration is only seen as a last resort. Some people think that gameplay can’t even exist outside of combat.

CryptoCurrency,We may have to face revisiting 16k tomorrow after the FED announcement,"With less than a day to go until the FOMC announcement, many are watching for the signs, rising inflation is still a problem in America, so the FOMC meeting will reveal whether they will go even harder. Expectations are currently 84-16 for 75bps, so the 0.75% is the better chance. 

Interest rates have a very big influence on the market and the crypto market, the NASDAQ is pretty much at make it or break it level. In the case of the NASDAQ, if we fall another 1% or so and break the level, we're back to the mid-July level, which would mean we're still breakeven after basically 2 months of movement.

The situation is no brighter for BTC, where we have crawled below the zone several times and have been able to climb back so far, but now we have not even been able to break out of the zone to the upside - we have only been above 19600 for a short time. The problem is that if this level falls, the next zone below it may come, which is around 16k - the current zone was not only a support on days, weeks, but also on months (!), so breaking it would be a huge warning for us. Perhaps we can still hope for a bounce to 17600 if we start down, but overall if this scenario comes true, we are in for some very grim times.

In the long direction, of course, the important thing would be to break above 19600-20k, so it is worth setting an alert here.",cryptocurrency,1663704859

gaming,Grandma in fallout dnd session 19: Come fly with me,"Grandma took irvine's actions as a personal slap in the face, so as her character PPG, she constructed a plan.

Pretty much she crafted her own FBI that deals with any problem characters in her faction whether its player or npc. She gives them a corvega bought with taxes and has them wear black suits, she then has them drive to new vegas.

They had a single key card among her crew of 5 and it was the only way to disengage a modified autopilot engaged on the vertibird that currently only goes to ohio. Each of them carries a tranquilizer dart gun and two carry tazers, their goal is to capture, contain and bring irvine back so they can attempt to synthesize a cure from him.

And with that, everything is set into place.

Courier acts as if hes supposed to give to irvine his ransom for the cure, he rigs the sniper rifle given to irvine to blow up if it is used.

Irvine then tells him to plant it at a special location outside new vegas, once irvine picked up his side of the bargain- he immediately goes to find a carriage he had stashed with a brahmin for his great get away.

His promise of a cure was a major bluff and he knew he'd be marked the moment the others realized this.

At the outer limits of new vegas he is stopped by PPG's men as they tell him they are here to escort him back.


Irvine takes this as a sign PPG hasnt wised up to the situation.

As he slips off his carriage, he decides mid walk that he didnt trust them, the moment he hesitated- he was shot with two tazers and immediately pushed into endurance saving throws

Both fail and he's immediately tranquilized and cuffed.

When he awakes, he realizes he is surrounded and cuffed in a ""X"" formation

He attempts to break the cuffs as he memes the ""I CAN BREAK THESE CUFFS"" meme, immediately failing.


But he had another ace up his sleeve, he took a ghoul harvester/plant perk that allowed his blood to burn through things like acid, he watched the guards as they periodically switch positions.

Biting his lip, he spits some across the chains of his cuffs, the men were not phased by it, they failed their perception checks and did not realize what was unfolding before them.

Immediately irvine snaps from the first cuff and immediately grabs the guy behind him, using his body as cover as he yanks at the second cuffs.

Grandma didnt think about how good their aim would need to be against a player or how players are far stronger than npcs.

First one shot hits the guy on top, the second hits irvine and he now must do a endurance check to not fall asleep.

He passes. The hit guy failed his roll and passes out. He pops his second cuff and proceeds to use the npc's limp body as a shield 

He is shot twice, he now must endurance save -2 to his rolls, he passes *again*

Next turn, he grabs the tranquilizer and dart's one of the guys fighting him, the guy fails the roll barely,yet passes out still, he uses the rest of his turn to snap the last of his chains.


Irvine passes AGAIN. 

He attempts to charge the final guard, slamming him to the door, stunning him fir a turn.

Irvine slides the door open and tosses him from the vertibird.


He takes the turn to collect the dart guns and  load each one, by some miracle from god, he passes again, with only about 20% chance to pass each time.

He uses a bobby pin to unlock the cockpit and dart's the co-pilot. He then goes into an all out gunfight with the pilot between a tazer shot at him and the dart guns. Irvine then is hit again!!


He passes, with 10% chance left!

He takes out the pilot and tosses him from the vertibird and takes the seat. He's excited and feels like he upgraded his winnings and got grandma's vertibird!

He cant get the controls to work, they wont budge! He finds his stuff begins attempting to pry at the auto pilot  controls locked below, he realizes the keycard slot and has a brief ""oh.. no.."" reaction once he thought how that might of been on one of the men, but he had no time to search.

 once again, he rolls to stay awake again- he succeeds.

He rolls pilot and begins to realize the biggest horror in his situation, he never added skillpoints to pilot and has NO IDEA how to fly it!

He presses every button, I allow him 2 more pilot rolls, he crit fails and it begins to spin out!  He panics as he attempts to try and get control- with a crit success to science, he figure out how to stabilize the flight.

He fixes it by snapping on the autopilot and prepares his plan for after his saving throw... except the inevitable hit, he failed the roll and proceeded to pass out in the pilot seat.

On his flight on the slightly altered auto pilot, he flies over grandma's mercy hospital city.

Grandma watches with the medical team as the vertibird flies over, only to pass overhead and gently crashing miles out into the distance.


Grandma wasnt expecting this of all things to happen, so as PPG, she grabs her followers McCormack and Rodger to follow her and for her bounty hunter river, to stay behind.

She felt bringing a follower who has a connection to the prisoner was asking for trouble.


As she arrives at the tipped vertibird, she has rodger pull out irvine to the brittle brown grass.


""Any survivors?"" She asks

Rodger replies ""none, I dont see the other guys""


Ppg sighs and pulls out her wattz 2000 pistol


Irvine succeeds  a saving throw to awake, he realized his dangerous situation and attempted the only idea he had.


He pulls free his dart gun and shoots at grandma

It misses, but as he fled the opposite direction, it only took one shot for Ppg to paint the brown ground in a spray of red matter as irvine immediately goes limp.


""Bag him up, wear the hazmat suits, leave no pieces and dont get any blood on you, we dont know what else he carries""


And with that, Grandma kills her first player. She proceeds to have a biohazard team clean the mess, burn the area for good measure and bag any possibly contaminated dirt.",technology,1663705808

7. How can Treasury maximize the development and use of emerging technologies like blockchain analytics, travel rule solutions, or blockchain native AML/CFT solutions, to strengthen AML/CFT compliance related to digital assets?

8. How can financial institutions offering digital assets better integrate                                           controls focused on fiat currency and digital asset transaction monitoring and customer identification information to more effectively identify, mitigate, and report illicit finance risks?

personalfinance,Which interest rate to go with,"Some context.  Started the home building process April 2021.  Set up an adjustable rate mortgage for a construction loan (since a traditional con loan is only good for 1 year, we risked going over the timeframe and incuring closing costs another time).

Rate is at 4.125 for the first 5 years. Currently have 3.5 years left on that rate.

The home just finished and we have a rate lock for a 30 year. At 6.125 expiring soon. (Couldn’t refinance or lock until the home was complete. We got that rate as soon as we were able to)

With the arm that we are currently in we would have an adjustment at year 5, year 6 and year 7.  Then it will remain that rate for the life of the loan.

It can increase (or decrease) a maximum of 2% at each adjustment.

Assuming worst case
In 3.5 years &gt; 6.125
In 4.5 years &gt; 8.125
In 5.5 years &gt; 10.125

We would be ok making the payments at 6.125 for the 30.

We also could make the payments when they get up to 10%

We are leaning towards riding out the arm then refinancing.  We have a lot of expenses with a new home and projects. (Gutters, yard, landscaping, etc)

Crypto Market Overview

Crypto and equities markets finished the last week with losses, preparing for this week’s FED announcements Crypto markets dropped heavily with Bitcoin down by over 10% compared to the previous week, closing at 19.419 on Sunday ETH experienced the biggest slump by almost 25%

The Merge had successfully taken place on September 15th, 2022, at 08:42:42 GMT+2 at a Block #15.537.393, marking the full transition of the network from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), which will cut energy consumption by about 99.95% compared to the PoW consensus mechanism However the successful upgrade had not fuelled the Ether’s price further up Instead, the price remained flat at the Merge event and finished the week down at 1.335. Equities, on the other hand, dropped by around 5% with NASDAQ closing at 11.448 and S&amp;P closing at 3.873 last Friday

The FED is expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75% this week The consumer price index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on last Tuesday, increased by 0.1% in August, ending at 8.3%, down from 8.5% in July 2022, but still at four-decade highs. Headline inflation rose 0.1% month over month, even with falling petrol prices

Core inflation rose 0.6% month over month, translating to an annual increase of 6.3%, up from 5.9% recorded during the previous period. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a decline of 0.1% for overall inflation, with a rise of 0.3% for core inflation. Moreover, Economists polled by Reuters forecast the CPI fell by 0.1% month-on-month in August, resulting in 8.1% for August 2022, down from 8.5% a month earlier

Despite the drop in gasoline prices, the rise in core inflation fuelled speculation that the FED will have to step up with further rate increases on its next meetings. According to Refinitiv, the new expectations point the federal funds rate to a new target range of 3.80% to 4.20% by end of 2022, with a peak of 3.94% – 4.45% around March 2023

Overall, the crypto market sentiment (measured by Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index) continues to stand at 21/100, indicating Extreme Fear, compared to a month ago when the Index stood at 29/100.

For example, with Fed funds rate set to increase 75BP tomorrow, it will take around a month for online banks to reach the maximum increase in savings interest rates.

However for our more conservative investment decisions, I was wondering if I was overlooking anything regarding paying extra on the mortgage versus buying 10 year treasury notes.   Let's assume 10 year rates remain the same for the sake of discussion.  Is it as simple as comparing the 5.5% return of the mortgage to the 10 year's \~3.5% return?

personalfinance,Borrowing $30k from Roth 401k to finish reno and addition on primary residence? Bad idea? Better options?,"We paid $160k for the house in 2008 and have put about $40k into since then.  We had kids a couple of years ago and have no desire to leave, but we would like to do a sizable addition.

To accomplish this, we did a 10-year cash-out refi in 2021 at 2.125% and took $200k.  Appraisal on the house at the time was $390k.

We have several well-reviewed and personally recommended general contractors that we feel comfortable with, and they're coming in around $280k for the job.  We have $60k in savings that we're willing to put toward the job, but that leaves us with a shortfall of $20k (assuming no major issues or changes).

We have not committed to anything, but all that's left is signing a contract and pulling permits.  We like where we are and so have only looked at a couple of houses in person (but many online) and there's nothing under $500k that we're interested in because they either lack something we'll get out of the addition or they require their own work to make it into something we want (or both).  If we were to immediately turn around and sell the house after the addition, I believe it would only add only about $200k in value; I realize this is a terrible return on investment, but we're not too worried about it since this is first and foremost a change to the house we plan to be in at least until the kids finish high school (more than 10 years), with an overall target of leaving only after they've finished college (if they choose to go).

So now we're looking for the best way to come up with the additional $20-30k.  I've been at the same job (which I love) for more than 15 years and do not plan on leaving.  In addition to a pension, I have a Roth 401(k) that I've been contributing to for most of that time and will be limited to the $50k borrow maximum.

Given the current economic environment - interest rates, the stock market, etc - is borrowing from the 401(k) a reasonable source of funds to fill in the gap between cash on hand and the cost to do the project?  We should be able to comfortably pay it back in 18-24 months, though possibly sooner since (as far as I know) you can't contribute to the account while you have money borrowed out of it, meaning I would be paying it back using money that would have otherwise been put in as a contribution.

investing,"What if it really is as simple as ""don't fight the Fed""? Why DCA into equities during known unfavorable conditions?","It's undeniable that the bull run of basically 2009 -&gt; 2021 was fueled at least partially (if not majorly) by various forms of quantitative easing. Interest rates were historically extremely low. If you couple them with inflation at the time (2-3%), it was basically free to borrow money (with interest rates being 0-0.25%).

The market has very few reasons to be bullish in the current short term (6-18 months). The market is forward looking. We're starring down the barrel of at least 12 months of ""no more quantitative easing"" (aka higher interest rates). Couple that with quanatitive tighting, consumers feeling the effects of inflation and being unable to scrounge together discretionary funds for travel, renovations, general consumerism, etc.

Russia/Ukraine is, from what it seems, not getting any better.

American wages are having to grow due to a tight labor market. ""Quiet quitting"" is becoming a major thing. How are companies supposed to innovate/grow in these conditions?

There really isn't one country/region that is doing well. Europe has its issues. China has its issues. America has it issues.

Advice around here says: have about 3-6 months worth of cash and put the rest into equities. You're talking about most people having 95% of their non-real-estate net worth in equities based on how close they are relative to their retirement.

S&amp;P could stand to fall a lot more from 3800, couldn't it? We're still in a 19-20x P/E ratio area which is above 15x-17x which is the historical average. Historically, we're still technically ""expensive"". Historically, interest rates are still low, meaning they have more room to rise. If earnings suck during the next 2 quarters (which, they might/probably will for a slew of reasons), price could totally fall and we'd *still* be expensive P/E wise.

CPI/PCE have yet to top/slow down based on recent reports. We don't know how the ""European energy crisis"" will play out for the winter.

How likely is it that we will be back to 4500 within 18 months (18% from current levels)? Can the 2m+ investors here who have the majority of their net worth in equities really stomach another 15-30%+ downturn in the next 12-18 months?

Are the days of ""just DCA and you'll make 10% returns with dividends reinvested"" over because the Federal Reserve finally turned off the easy free money cheat code? Are we in for a decade of subpar returns?",finance,1663721858

CryptoCurrency,What To Expect From Fed Meeting on Wednesday,"I think we are actually at the point where the reality of the bear market has set in for everyone. There are some  trader who held on to hope that the Merge would have a positive effect on markets. It seemed to have ended up being a typical buy the rumour sell the news situation and even then it's effects were limited. 

Knowing that we know now, markets do not look good. Fed chain Powell has stated that investors would [face pain in the fight against inflation](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/26/powell-warns-of-some-pain-ahead-as-fed-fights-to-lower-inflation.html). It's not that crypto is crash *all* markets are crashing. Real estate may have been the last man standing but with [the highest morgage rates in over a decade since the Great Financial Crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/09/15/mortgage-rates-6-percent/), home prices will surely fall. Morgage rates being *the* determiner of of your house if cheap or expensive means real estate must fall. And experts are [seeing early signs of this crash.](https://fortune.com/2022/09/18/housing-market-downturn-moves-into-second-stage-falling-home-prices/)

The question is really how high will Powell push up rates. We have be meandering with .75 percent for a while but it's clear that this is not enough. Inflation rates have been largely unchanged for the last couple of readings. We should consider the reading at 9.1% in June as an outlier because this was the month when there were high political tensions and huge speculation that Europe would be fully cut off from Russian gas. This huge speculation was in turn reflected in markets which later corrected for. Outside of this, even if you want to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt that they did lower rates .1% or so I must remind you that inflation is **still** at a WHOPPING 8 percent. 

I will further introduce you to the concept of neutral interest rates. This is basically a rate that keeps causes zero change in inflation. It means interest rates are *just* high enough to keep inflation down and *just* low enough that inflation doesn't increase. It is fair to say that we are close to this neutral interest rate as we have mostly been stuck at around the low to mid eight point something percent . The problem is that we need to bring inflation *down* and as such rates must be brought higher than this neutral rate to being inflation down and be brought *much* higher than this neutral rate to bring inflation down *quickly.*

Now remember that mid-term elections are very near and the Biden administration has been heavily berated by critics over the inflation levels. Of course, the FED is *supposed* to be independent but we all know how government really works. As a quote from Investopedia, ""*The President* nominates the chair and is permitted to be vocal about the direction of the Fed"". As such, Biden being under pressure is Powell being under pressure. Even without mid-terms, the interviews of Powell by members of Congress regarding inflation have been scalding. Quite a number US citizens also have choice words for Powell as well.

Thus, I am expecting a full 1% rate hike. At the very least .75% would be the go-to, but 1% is absolutely on the table; front and centre in my opinion. And considering the majority of investors are in sync with the rough market reality, the bears are going to wake up from hibernation just before winter and eat everything in sight.",cryptocurrency,1663726259

\-------------------

The United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against prominent crypto influencer, investor, and entrepreneur Ian Ballina over an initial coin offering (ICO) dating back to 2018.

The SEC accused Ballina purchased $5 million worth of SPRK tokens from Sparkster Ltd. and received 30% bonus tokens before he started promoting it on social media. He did not disclose that he was given an incentive to promote the ICO, the regulator has charged in its lawsuit in federal court in Austin, Texas, media [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-19/cryptocurrency-analyst-was-paid-5-million-to-push-ico-sec-says?srnd=premium-asia#xj4y7vzkg) said. 

## SEC’s Case Against Sparkster   

Sparkster and its CEO Sajjad Daya hogged the media headlines in 2018 and 2019 for never launching the SPRK tokens for which they had already raised $30 million in ETH. In an interesting development, one of the Sparkster wallets from 2018 got activated for the first time in May 2022, and 14,200 ETH tokens were swapped for $22.7 million USDC.      

According to the SEC statement on Monday, Sparkster Ltd. raised $30 million from about 4,000 investors in an unregistered ICO between April and July 2018. The company and its CEO Sajjad Daya have agreed to pay $35 million in a settlement to resolve investors’ claims of losses due to the unregistered SPRK offering, it added.

The SEC has been apparently on a trail of unregistered ICOs cheating investors during the ICO boom of 2017 and 2018. It has filed lawsuits in several such cases.

In February, the agency [charged](https://cryptopotato.com/sec-charged-three-involved-in-ico-fraud-backed-by-steven-seagal/) three individuals for allegedly defrauding over $11 million through an ICO in 2018. Famous American actor and martial artist specialist Steven Seagal was one of the promoters of this project. 

Last year, the Commission went after three Rivetz Group companies and Rivetz Corp CEO Steven K. Sprague for conducting an [unregistered ICO](https://cryptopotato.com/sec-charges-rivetz-corp-ceo-over-a-18-million-fraudulent-ico/) that raised $18 million. The SEC complaint said the defendants offered and sold digital assets called RvT tokens to the public, including investors from the US, between July and September 2017.

## Ian Balina’s Role in Failed ICO 

The 33-year-old Ian Ballina describes himself as a “World Renown Investor, Entrepreneur, Speaker, and Author” on his website and claims to have a master’s degree in computer science. He has also worked with IBM Watson as a data scientist. Ballina is the founder and CEO of Token Metrics, “a data analytics platform for crypto that helps investors leverage machine learning to become smarter investors.”

In 2017, Ballina used Token Metrics analytics for crypto investments that saw his $20,000 fund swell into a $5-million portfolio of crypto assets, he informs on his site. 

His website is also carrying his [Response to the SEC](https://ianbalina.com/sec-wells-memo-response/), where he refutes charges as “baseless.” He calls his investment in SPRK “a private pre-sale purchase” and a 30% bonus as a “volume-based discount from the public sale price.” 

## Ballina Defends  

Ballina defends himself from the SEC charges in his submission to the court, where he describes the allegations made by the regulator as “unfounded effort based upon multiple misconceptions of fact and law….” Excerpts of the submission are available on Ballina’s website. He also posted his [defense](https://twitter.com/DiaryofaMadeMan/status/1571992340121747457) arguments through his Twitter handle.

&gt;“We are prepared to fight these frivolous charges to the US Supreme Court,” his legal team says on Ballina’s website.

He denies the accusations that he invested $1.2 million in SPRK and indicated that he invested only $106,915.50, and like other investors in the scheme, he, too, was a victim of fraud.",cryptocurrency,1663738870

We won't get to 400bps until November of this year (I didn't know that, I thought we were closer to 4% interest rates)

It seems the market really isn't pricing in anything above 450-475bps to be honest

There's a very slight hint that rates will peak by 06/2023 but that's obviously wild speculation/nobody has a clue/up for debate.

Market very wall may not be pricing in what earnings will look like for corporations in ""higher"" interest rate environments.",finance,1663744464

economy,Why do long term bonds have such a high demand ahead of their terminal rate?,"Let me preface this by saying I understand why the yield curve is inverted - there is an auction style market place for bonds in which the lowest bidder is awarded the bond; in addition demand for long term bonds is higher than that of short term bonds, driving down the yields.  


But why?  


The market has priced in an 82% chance of a 75bps rate hike, and an 18% chance of a 100 bps rate hike, with an end of year fed funds rate of 425-450 bps, which may not even be the terminal rate.  


Why would anyone buy 30 year bonds yesterday, when they can wait until today to get a greater yield? If we aren't at terminal rates, wouldn't it make sense for entities to buy shorter term bonds with greater yields until the rate hikes are over, and only then buy up long term bonds?",finance,1663753798

economy,The Celestial Empire and the Sultanate Are Getting Power,"The Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit, which was established in 2001 on the initiative of Moscow like the “Kremlin’s Friends Club + China”, has come to an end. For many years, the SCO, under the de facto leadership of Russia, was half-asleep, since Moscow, trying to create opposition to the Western blocs, made its main bet on the BRICS. But this year, Beijing has reformatted the SCO according to the principle of “China's zone of influence + partners.” The Russian Federation has clearly ceased to be a dominant in the SCO, and its status is in between the categories of “China's zone of influence” and “China's partner”.

Based on the results of the SCO Forum, the geography of this organization was expanded. Iran and Belarus entered it as full members, after which a dialogue began on the entry of Saudi Arabia and Qatar into the SCO. The latter can hit the oil and gas interests of the Russian Federation, because it will cease to be the largest source of hydrocarbons in this structure. In addition, during the summit, Beijing and Minsk has announced a declaration on a new level of relations. Moreover, the level of “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” between China and Belarus is (in the gradation of Chinese diplomacy) even higher than the level of “all-round strategic partnership and mutually beneficial cooperation” between China and Russia. That is, Beijing gave Moscow a signal about its views on the country, which the Kremlin considered to have practically become part of the Russian Federation.

It is revealing that right during the forum in Samarkand hostilities took place between countries that only yesterday were firmly within the sphere of Russia's interests. On the border of Europe and Asia, armed skirmishes have resumed for control over regional logistics between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In turn, there are sporadic clashes over the control of water resources and an uncoordinated borderline in Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan for many years. Neither Russia itself, nor its pocket CSTO military bloc, could in any way help in neutralizing these hot spots. The conflicting parties independently agreed on a ceasefire. At the same time, Kazakhstan received guarantees of security and territorial integrity from the PRC.

In general, the South Caucasus and Central Asia has demonstrated at this summit (except for Uzbekistan, which did so a few years earlier) that they are decisively leave a zone of influence of the Russian Federation. The SCO Forum became a “cold shower” for V. Putin, who, in front of foreign journalists, shifted from foot to foot, waiting alone before meetings of the heads of other countries, nervously sorting through papers and unsuccessfully trying to reply with a joke on questions from the press.

In Samarkand, the Russian president has publicly acknowledged that China, India and Turkey – three countries that are helping Russia in one way or another to circumvent Western restrictions – have many questions and concerns about Russia’s war against Ukraine. Probably, V. Putin asked Beijing, New Delhi and Ankara to recognize the results of the forthcoming referendums in the Donbas and the occupied territories of the South of Ukraine. However, it is unlikely that any of these three major international players will want to comply with the request of the leader of the Russian Federation and to get involved in a dubious adventure.

The Russian Federation at the SCO Forum tried to demonstrate to the world that it is making a U-turn from the West to the East — towards the Celestial Empire, the Ottoman Sultanate, the Iranian theocracy and India. This process is not an empty threat to the West, it is really happening. However, the intrigue is that after the failure of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, no one in the East does not view the Russian Federation as an equal anymore. Yes, Beijing, Ankara, Tehran and New Delhi continue to maintain close relations with Moscow. But, as the SCO Summit clearly demonstrated, all of them keep the Russian Federation purely on the sidelines.

V. Putin solemnly proclaimed “the end of the era of Western domination” in that part of the world where the SCO states are located. At this time, the countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia are trying to guess who will become the new dominant? Celestial Empire or Sultanate? But certainly not Russia!",finance,1663755599

Also look for comments from Chair J Powell, who I suspect will make some very pointed comments on the state of inflation, whether he thinks its peaking, and will reiterate how committed the Fed is in bringing inflation down.  Semantics matter here and industry listens careful to every word he says. 

I don't recommend new traders take up any trades today. If you do trade, use stoplosses and limit your timeframe because the probability is that today will see volatile price action swinging both ways.

# [Stock futures rise slightly ahead of the Federal Reserve’s expected interest rate hike](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-newshtml.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as traders looked ahead to a potential interest rate hike announcement from the Federal Reserve later in the day.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 60 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures also climbed 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures traded just above the flatline.
*****
&gt; The central bank on Wednesday is expected to deliver its third consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate hike to tame high inflation. A higher-than-expected consumer price index reading in August and hawkish comments on rate hikes from Fed leaders have weighed on stocks, with more pressure likely ahead as the central bank continues to fight inflation.
*****
&gt; Investors will be monitoring the central bank’s projections and comments from Chairman Jerome Powell for insight into how much more interest rates will rise and how that could impact economic growth.
*****
&gt; “Our sense is that markets could be set up for a short-lived relief rally if the Fed hikes by +75bps and Powell doesn’t ratchet up his hawkish rhetoric even further,” wrote Wolfe Research’s Chris Senyek in a note to clients. “That said, we don’t anticipate having to change our intermediate-term bearish call.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching for earnings from Lennar, KB Homes, General Mills and Steelcase Wednesday. Existing home sales will also be released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields dipped Wednesday after reaching levels not seen in more than a decade. The 2-year rate, which touched its highest level since 2007 in the previous session, was last down about 2 basis points at 3.948%. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 3.54% after hitting its highest level since 2011.
*****
&gt; Stocks fell Tuesday, the first day of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting. The Dow shed 1.01%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.13% and 0.95%, respectively.

stocks,The Fed needs to 'rip off the Band-Aid' and hike interest rates by 150 basis points,"[Full Article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-fed-meeting-interest-rate-hikes-wells-fargo-2022-9)

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Reserve should hike interest rates by 150 basis points — even though that would likely spark ""carnage"" in stocks, a top Wells Fargo strategist has said.

Most economists expect the US central bank to announce another jumbo rate hike of 75 basis points at the conclusion of its two-day meeting later Wednesday.

But given the Fed likely wants to raise its base rate from 2.5% to 4%, it should consider getting there by making one even more supersized hike in its September policy decision, Michael Schumacher told CNBC on Tuesday. 

""The Fed knows what the destination is. It's got the funds rate now, the upper bound is 2.5%,"" the Wells Fargo Securities' head of macro strategy said on ""Fast Money"". 

 ""Very likely it gets to 4%-plus this year,"" he added

""Why not just rip off the Band-Aid — let's get there in one day.""

The central bank has raised interest rates 75 basis points at its two previous consecutive meetings, in an effort to tame inflation running near 40-year highs. 

Schumacher acknowledged a 150 basis point hike is unlikely, because of the shock it would deliver to markets. Stocks have sagged, with the S&amp;P 500 down 19.3% year-to-date, as investors assessed whether the Fed's aggressive tightening could tip the US into a recession.

""The big fear in the market would be, 'Oh my goodness, they've done a record-sized move — what's going to happen next month or the month after that?'"" Schumacher said. 

""It would require incredibly good communication and confidence or the result: Carnage. And nobody wants that.""

Market still face turbulence in coming months from the central bank's unwinding of the loose monetary policies in place since the 2008 financial crisis, according to Schumacher.

""When you consider the last 10-plus years, we've had incredibly easy monetary policy for most of that time,"" he said. ""Super-stimulative fiscal policy in a lot of cases, especially the US."" 

 ""So, doing a very quick U-turn — I suspect it's going to be very rocky,"" he added. ""To think that it would somehow go smoothly from here is probably a big leap.""

US stock futures pointed to a slight gain at the open Wednesday, ahead of the Fed's decision, after the major indexes closed about 1% lower Tuesday. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.28%, Nasdaq futures rose 0.08%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 0.29%.",finance,1663767449

because profits have sky rocketed, while pay for workers barely catches up. If an entire industry decides overnight to raise the cost on customers - as a monopolized entity - without raising wages, then essentially we are just being scammed with the backing of the federal reserve throwing around the buzz word “inflation” in which consumers just.. become numb and accepting to it..

defi,Loaning NFTs: advantages and risks,"NFTs are no longer just a jpeg, nor an in-game asset, but a big business in the eyes of many developers. Using NFTs as collateral for a loan is now an option,  NFTs lending (which allows people to lend out their NFTs as collateral to borrow crypto) is thriving. I did some research before deciding to take a loan against my NFTs (I’m loaning my Axies), here are the pros and cons:

# Pros

**1. Get liquidity from NFTs without selling them**

We can’t always sell our NFTs instantly (unless at a very cheap price), borrowing crypto against NFTs became an instant liquidity option, which allows us to turn our asset into coins.

**2. For Axie Infinity players: still play and earn with Axies that have become collateral**

Some protocols like MetaLend allow gamers and scholars to continue playing with staked Axies and earn SLP, which is quite appealing. And we still have full control over our collateralized Axies.

**3. Change our mind anytime**

We can redeem our NFTs whenever we want. 

# Cons

**1. Some NFTs may be undervalued when there is a slump**

Market volatiles a lot, especially within the crypto market. Prices crash can lead to low appraisal, which means you can't borrow much with your NFTs.

**2. Interest rate can be high**

Some lending protocols offer loans at extremely high interest rates, that’s what we call a loan shark (just make sure the protocol on your list isn’t one of them).

Many have told me to cut my losses, but I was like, my Axies might still be helpful for my investment even though it's no longer its golden age… And more importantly, they still hold sentimental value to me and I would like to hold on to my Axies while exploring other uses.

When I’ve tried that, they simply say they won’t know the decision until we put in the application. Then they move onto the application part without any discussion. 

Is there a way to provide context before applying for a loan, or does that happen during the application process, or after?  I honestly don’t know that it will make a difference, but I have been denied all pre-approval opportunities from traditional sources. I don’t expect a guarantee of anything before submitting my application, but I also don’t want to have a ton of hard pulls if my application will most likely be denied. Currently, I’m a member of Navy Fed. The loan will be used to pay off old debt and cover an unexpected expense.

ethereum,Blockchain ≠ Decentralization,"You will be very surprised to hear that Islam and Confucianism are almost the same religion. In fact, people in the East are also surprised to hear it. The same is true for Middle Easterns. However, if you read both the Analects and the Koran, you will find that the two share the same living feelings and lifestyles. That is, Confucianism is Islam without God, and Islam is Confucianism with God. Other than that, they share the same root.

The same is true of democracy and anarchism. A democracy has a president or a prime minister. Anarchism, on the other hand, does not have it. So in the event of the Great Depression, there is a person who is responsible in democracy, but there is no person who is responsible in anarchism. The words responsibility of all co-operative members are the same as the words no one is responsible. In other words, anarchism is a democracy with no one to take responsibility for, and democracy is anarchism with someone to be responsible for.

Blockchainers shout anarchism, namely, decentralization. Satoshi pursued an anarchic financial system. In particular, the subprime crisis of 2008 affected him. Thus, most Satoshi followers, or blockchain followers, advocate an anarchist financial system. But what will happen if the financial system is operated by anarchism?

In anarchism, members of the cooperative are not held accountable. On the surface, everything seems to flow beautifully. But Putin suddenly invaded Ukraine. Then prices around the world began to soar. In this situation, which is suitable for crisis management, the current democratic financial system or the blockchain financial system? From my point of view as an economist, if we leave this situation to anarchism, the global economy will end up in either hyperinflation or panic. The reason is that no one is responsible. Users, or coin cooperatives, cast TXs and vote only for their immediate benefit. In the case of democracy, the Fed chairman, the president, and even the ruling party's House and Senate feel responsible. But there are no such people in the blockchain. There are only co-operative members who put private interests before public interest.

In the 19th century, a communist capitalist in a country conducted an experiment in which he handed over his factory management rights to workers. He expected the factory to prosper. But the factory went bankrupt shortly afterwards. In the face of laziness and insincere decision-making, the company has become a mess.

The ability of the blockchain is in the ""record"". In this world, all areas that require records can be the territory of the blockchain. In this case, managers are not required. It doesn't guarantee the authenticity of the record's content (this is the famous Oracle issue), but at least the fact that it was recorded by a true author is guaranteed, and it doesn't cost at all. Namely, management personnel are not required. This is the ability of the blockchain. 

The ability of blockchain is nothing more or less. It is neither more nor less than the ability to guarantee who wrote it at no cost. However, this ability does not extend to the ability to realize the decentralization, or 19c anarchist ideology. It's just a guarantee that it's a document you wrote. The ideal of anarchism will never be achieved only with the fact that the documents of this world are not forged. The ideology of anarchism is not achieved just because additional personnel are not needed to prevent forgery. What it means is that the ideology of ""de-centralization"" is not achieved by preventing forgery at no cost. Nevertheless, when people talk about blockchain, they always shout decentralization. This is nothing but the belief that the ""record revolution"" can achieve the ideals of anarchism.

Now let's look at the reality. What does DeFi look like now, which has been calling for decentralization? Is it a beautiful image of anarchism? No. It's nothing more than an image of gamble. Tax evasion and money laundering are rampant. The USDT is refusing to audit. These are worse people than Lehman Brothers executives who caused subprime mortgages. They were audited at least. That is, the current DeFi is not the decentralization. It's just Sodom and Gomorrah. Blockchainers are ostensibly calling for the decentralization, or the beautiful ideal of anarchism, but their inner hearts are only pursuing Sodom and Gomorrah.

The area in which the blockchain can exert its utility can be expanded only to the extent corresponding to the special ability of the blockchain. In other words, it can be effective only in the realm of plain daily life where it is no problem even if there is no one to take responsibility. But this area is incredibly wide. Blockchain can reduce costs and manpower in almost every day life, such as IoT, auctions, voting, etc. And these are the areas that smartcontracts should go. However, in this area, you cannot feel any decentralized nuance. It's nothing more than a good cost-cutting technique. Bringing up the term anarchism in these scene is just out of the blue.

Blockchain has no relationship with decentralization. Rather, centralized intervention is essential. Without it, it has no choice but to move in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and that is what it looks like in the present reality.",cryptocurrency,1663772073

stocks,The Fed will save the stock market and cut interest rates if a deep recession occurs next year,"[Full Article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-fed-save-markets-rate-cuts-deep-recession-2022-9)

&amp;#x200B;

Just as fast as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 2022, they could do the exact opposite in 2023 and cut rates, according to JPMorgan.

That's if a deep economic recession materializes and corporate earnings plummet, JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic said in a Wednesday note. 

The Fed has been on an aggressive rate hike path so far this year, with another outsized 75-basis-point increase expected later today. That would push the federal funds rate to a range of 3.0% to 3.25% by the end of today, a far cry from its range at the start of the year of 0% to 0.25%.

By the end of 2022, current market expectations suggest the fed funds rate will be in a range of 4% to 4.25% as Fed Chair Jerome Powell seeks to extinguish high inflation readings.

 But interest rate hikes take time to flow through the economy, meaning there's an ongoing risk that the Fed overtightens as it focuses on lagging indicators while economic growth slows. None of this is lost on JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who is set to testify to Congress later today.

""Many Americans are feeling the pain, and consumer confidence continues to drop. While these storm clouds build on the horizon, even the best and brightest economists are split as to whether these could evolve into a major economic storm or something much less severe,"" Dimon said in prepared testimony.

A key factor to watch is if the unemployment rate begins to rise, as it has consistently stayed below the 4% mark since December. The rate recently nudged higher to 3.7% in August from 3.5% in July.

""The decline in earnings could become more significant if the unemployment rate starts moving up materially and a protracted or deep recession takes place,"" Kolanovic said. But such a scenario doesn't mean investors should ditch stocks, because the Fed could return to its years-long practice of easing financial conditions, according to the note.

 ""But even in this adverse scenario we believe that the Fed would be cutting rates by more than is currently priced in for 2023, thus backstopping equity markets and inducing higher P/E multiples,"" he added. 

The market is currently pricing in a Fed pause in interest rate hikes for most of 2023, with two potential 25-basis-point rate cuts occurring towards the end of next year. Kolanovic ultimately believes those rate cuts could accelerate considerably if economic strength begins to deteriorate. 

A potential markets-friendly Fed in 2023, combined with low investor positioning and a decline in long-term inflation expectations, suggests that downside in the stock market is limited at current levels, even if a slowdown materializes next year, Kolanovic concluded.",finance,1663774191

investing,Can we talk about bank liquidity?,"Hi all. I'll say this that I'm not a particularly smart man. So bear with me and help me understand why more people aren't talking about potential bank liquidity issues going forward.

**2007-2009**

Housing collapses, Fed cuts rates to an average of 0.16% in 2009, banks get bailed out with the dollar amount as low as $700 billion, as high as $4.5 trillion. The bailout was done in part by buying up MBS  

**2010-2019**

Despite being clearly out of the recession by 2013-2014, if you want match pre-recession job numbers. It ""technically"" ended in 2009. In 2014 we started to see the Fed slowly raise interest rates but continue to buy MBS after starting to shed it's MBS held, as it had declined from $1.2t after the great recession, to $800b by 2012, to *skyrocketing* to $1.7 trillion by 2014 and only slowly tapering to $1.4 trillion by the beginning of 2020.  

**2020-2021**

COVID happens, Feds immediately cut rates to practically zero which in part massively expanded the money supply  despite the velocity of money (VoM) falling off a cliff. Mix in massive supply constraints and demand from people locked in their home for a year, you can't expand your money supply AND have your velocity of money fall off a cliff, and not expect inflation to happen. During that time, the Federal Reserve also continued to buy up MBS, raising total MBS held by the Fed to $2.7 trillion. Keep in mind, this is all the while the Federal Reserve was calling inflation ""transitory"" and has only recently, after inflation has hit a high of 8%+, admitted that it was indeed not transitory. *Aren't these guys supposed to be some of the smartest people in the world?*

**March 2022 to today**

On top of it's first interest rate hike, in March the Federal Reserve announced it would no longer buy MBS starting in September, with it's last purchase being almost a week ago now.

**Potential liquidity issues**

Alright that's a little history, here are my issues; banks and financial institutions have been depending on the Fed's SOMA (MBS buying operation); just churning out mortgages and converting back into cash knowing full well they can just flip it to the Fed (and make a little bit of money, too!). Well, what happens now? The Fed spent the better part of the last decade and then some providing liquidity to banks via buying their MBS, on top of cheap Fed Fund rates. Well, because we abused low interest rates for the past decade and a half, gone are the days of being able to lend out money for practically free. ""But what does that have to do with MBS?"" Both buying up MBS and lowering interest rates were a play to provide liquidity for banks. The Fed has lost that mechanism (low interest) of being able to provide liquidity to banks because inflation is high and we need to raise interest rates as such. Before we could keep money cheap because inflation with 2-3% per year. We don't have that privilege anymore.

Also, now that the biggest buyer of MBS out of the business, who are going to buy these MBS? Especially considering we KNOW that interest rates are going to rise, these are going to be less valuable going forward? An MBS portfolio is similar in characteristics to bonds, in which when interest rates go up, bonds tend to go down, evidenced by the 10-20% decline in most bond funds YTD. No one wants to invest in fixed income bond, MBS or otherwise when they know inflation is (and will continue to be) higher than the rate of return, as well as the Fed rate continuing to go up (on purpose, to fight inflation). 

Brings me to my last point... if there is no one to buy MBS, how will banks turn their mortgage holdings into cash? We already see Wells Fargo, which at one point sold 1 our of every 3 new mortgages, retreating from the mortgage business. This is a bank that currently holds over $170 billion in MBS, and services almost a trillion dollars in residential mortgages. They are the second largest mortgage lender in the nation. JP Morgan has started laying off hundreds of employees . The majority of banks have steadily tried getting out of the MBS business. They are smarter than us, they saw the writing on the wall years ago and are trying to get other people to ""hold the bag"" which explains the explosion in mutual fund and ETFs that actively purchase MBS and pawn them off to retail investors and institutional investors such as pension fund managers.  

I have a feeling banks are going to run into liquidity issues because no one is going to want to buy their MBS (which would give them cash), and there is only going to be so much they can offload on the (mostly) American people. Not only that but other small, but nagging factors of a recession are starting to come into play like car repossessions and consumer debt overall climbing to all-time highs. 

**Conclusion**: I think we're going to have a large credit crunch. Of course that's expected to some extent with the rise in interest rates, but what I don't think is expected is the liquidity that these banks have depended on for well over a decade, on top of increased car repossessions and other credit defaults that surely aren't going to help the situation. I think there might be a bailout on par or worse than what we saw in 2009, because sure, in 2009 the housing market (and the MBS) was just cracked all around, but we were at least able to play with interest rates paired with buying up MBS to lessen the blow. Not only have we lost that mechanism, but it's actively making it worse because we HAVE to aggressively raise interest rates to fight inflation. This will get worse with unemployment too, which will almost surely happen with the Fed's need to fight inflation. 

(also doesn't help we delayed the 2010 adoption of Basel III, *again*, which ranks banks risk-weighted assets a lot more aggressively and thoroughly than before.)

EDIT: **Adding to this for people who believe I'm on the wrong path here, explain this:**

Let's look at the consumer banking and lending balance sheet of say, Wells Fargo;

https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/annual-reports/2021-annual-report.pdf

Of the $333 billion in assets,  $225 billion of it is under mortgages / home lending. Look at page 37.

**Is 68% not a big number?**

Also look at page 74, ""Primary Sources of Liquidity"" $293 billion of it's $559 billion in liquidity came from agency MBS.

Is this a worthwhile decision based on the below?

Would you also consider purchasing a car (my first car used or new)?

**Background:**

30 - Male - Single

After pursing art while burning through my savings in my mid-20s, and then getting a decent job ($60K) 6 months before the pandemic hit - I moved from a notable Midwest city back home with my family on the east coast in late 2020 to save money on rent/city expenses.

Since then, I’ve gotten a better job recently in May 2022 ($90K – fully remote).

**Reasons for moving:**

I currently live with my family (short driving distance to Philly) and while it’s been great to save up while living with them, my social/dating life has taken a hit and parents are having some martial/financial issues with each other that I really don’t want to be in the middle of any longer. I want to help them, but I really don’t know how, and it is a big stressor in my life just being around that energy. So basically, I’d like to get my own place, get back into dating, have a bit more control on my mental health by having my own space that I can manage.

**So, here’s my current snapshot:**

Salary: $90K + (% yearly bonus, unsure what I will receive after 6 months at new job this year)

Savings: $33K

Debt (Just Student Loans): $16K – however it will be **$6K** once I get my Fed Relief after December 2022.

Investments:

\- Roth 401K: $10K (10% contribution with 7% company match).

\- Roth IRA: $16K (Maxed out - $500/Mo)

\- HSA: $4K (Maxed out yearly - $252/Mo)

\- Crypto: $6K

Current Expenses:

\- Live with family so no rent but I help my parents out with: 

\-  groceries, gas, pay off part of property tax, international flight tickets to visit family etc.

\- My personal monthly expenses are minimal with some shopping splurges: a couple entertainment subscriptions, eating out/drinks with friends, buying home workout gear, supplements, sports, video games, etc.

= About \~ $1000 – large variations from summer travels.

Do you think the move is justified/worth it?

And if so, is a $1500 max apt rent acceptable for 2Be+1Ba? 

Would you consider buying a car before the move?

I know the market is bad currently for car purchases but maybe I can get lucky and find something used that’s fair price and good condition.

After i put money aside for bills^ and things I can barely save “cash”.  Given I want to buy my own property sooner than later as well as have savings for emergencies, not being able to save cash makes me feel hopeless in reaching these goals. 

I do put away(invest) 250$ every check into a SoFi account(1 for me 1 for my daughter) plus I have my work retirement account and a TSP, which I think are different? I have a traditional IRA at 10% and a Roth at 5%. I usually bump them up every time I get a raise. 

I do have debt. Credit cards, car loan student loans and medical bill. Roughly in debt of about $16,000. $26,000 if you include student loans which I have just been pushing off since I’m not being forced to pay right now. Also hoping to get rid of it since I am a federal employee. There are some programs to help. 

I’m always just making it. I recently moved up at work and got a a nice raise, just as my daughter started daycare and that extra monthly income goes right to daycare. Which was a blessing because idk what I would have done it prior to raise. 

1br, 1ba….Rent went up $50 last renewal and now another $90 for this next one. What’s going to happen next year? $120? Housing is wild in NJ, but thankfully my partner covers majority of rent and groceries. 

I rarely eat out or buy things that aren’t necessities and if I do I usually charge it to the game because my cash flow is not flowing. 

Should I not be saving and straight up putting it towards the debts? This scares me…..but I probably could pay off everything minus student loans in less than a year.

I wasn’t taught about finances growing up and i’m learning the hard way. I’ve gotten a lot better in last couple years financially, still a long way to go. I just need to vent and get some advice, thoughts, criticism. Help me see something in a new light.

If this is relevant, I was a nonresident alien for tax purposes in 2021 so I filed taxes as a nonresident.

A few days ago I realized that, when filing my 2021 return, I forgot to attach form 1099-INT and so I forgot to report my interest income from my savings account. It is a tiny amount: the total interest income for FY 2021 is 0.50$, of which 0.11$ were already withheld by my bank.

Do I have to amend my 2021 return even for such a small amount? I would of course like to have an immaculate tax record, also because technically there is the possibility (although I absolutely have no idea at the moment) that in the long term I may be appying for a green card. On the other hand, however, I wonder how importan/consequential such a small (honest) mistake might be.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: when filing taxes for 2021 I forgot to include 0.50$ of interest income from my savings account. Should I amend my return?",finance,1663778261

CryptoCurrency,"The recent ""War"" against Stablecoins is just preparing the ground for CBDC. You want to Buy, Sell and Trade Crypto? Ok, but you will have to use CBDC so we can track every move.","Is it me or is this just so obvious?

First SEC and the Feds are roasting all CEX, then they jumped on to Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum, now we can see that Stablecoins are also under the loop, especially with a new Bill that will basically make it possible for Stablecoins to comply within the next 2-3 years, probably even longer or probably never, if it gets passed. 
 
The massive focus and attention that SEC is bringing up towards regulating Crytocurrency is just immense. 

The worst part is the tone, it's straight aggressive and it just creates this FUD cluster on everything that has decentralization in its core.

Strangely enough, this happens at the same period when the Crypto Framework is being released and the announcement that there will be a CBDC. 

For me personally, I just think its so obvious. Things are being cleared out right now, stablecoins are going to be demolished so that everything is ready for a government backed CBDC. 

CEX will have to play by the new regulations and rules and probably make it mandatory to the users to use the CBDC as this will allow the government to carefully track every possible step of every user in the US. 

This is of course not just the case with the US, its worldwide, and this is a ""last"" attempt to jump the train as Mass Institutional Adoption is imminent. 

Todays stablecoins have some massive challenges and problems, but the monopolistic introduction of CBDC is in my opinion just an attack on DeFi as its trying to prevent it from spreading further. That of course also explains the recent news about Tornado Cash and that Proof of Stake is being a security claim...

IMO this is not the Mass Adoption and regulation that we need, because once again, the users will lose control and be highly dependent on the government which is ironic as cryptocurrency was invented in order to stop just that.",cryptocurrency,1663779142

CryptoCurrency,House stablecoin bill begins to take shape,"House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Patrick McHenry released an update on the bipartisan stablecoin bill and believes it will be introduced this year but acknowledges time is running out. Yesterday evening Financial Services Committee Democrats met to discuss this newest draft and the next steps. While the whole draft is not known there are some known components of the bill including:

&amp;#x200B;

* Federal Reserve oversight on non-bank payment stablecoin issues while letting state regulators maintain their role
   * New York for instance has already announced and released stablecoin regulations and this type of thing is common and can also be seen in how California is able to set much higher environmental standards than those that exist in other states. 
* Insured depository institutions and credit unions that issue stablecoins would fall under the oversight of appropriate federal banking agency 
* A two-year ban on what lawmakers are calling ""endogenously collateralized stablecoins"" 
   * This is a result of LUNA and its TerraUSD
* Stablecoin issuers would have to maintain adequate reserves in cash, short-term Treasury bills (90 days or less), or repurchase agreements with a maturity of seven days or less – backed by short-term Treasuries. Central bank reserve deposits can also count toward reserves.
   * This would finally set standards for stating a stablecoin has full $1 to $1 backing like Circle (USDC), Tether (USDT), and Paxos have done with various types of backing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Representative McHenry also stated creating legislation for something this new and big was going to take time and that if it was not introduced this Congress it will be the next Congress. It should be noted that like with the recently passed H.R. 7338 that there is no bill like it in the Senate and the process that it has to go through can take a very very long time leading to the bills dying in committee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Without knowing what the bill will look like in its entirety it is still too early to judge it one way or another. Some of the points above though are just common sense things that are being codified so that they can be acted upon.",cryptocurrency,1663780689

personalfinance,Buy car now? or wait until after we buy a house?,"My husband and I have about $85K in cash just in our savings accounts right now because we were expecting to buy a house earlier this year. Well, the market was horrible so now we are renting at a pretty low rate and in a good spot that we plan to stay in for another year and we'll look at houses again. Since it is so short term we decided to keep the money in savings rather than in investments. In our current set up we have one car that is paid off and I work from home, but once we get a house and then probably have a baby shortly after, we'll probably need a second car. 

So my question is, should we buy the car now? or wait until after getting the house? 
And if we buy the car now, should I just buy it with cash because the interest rates are so high? but then we wouldn't have as much as we'd like for a down payment for the mortgage right? or would it even out because we wouldn't have monthly payments, it'd be monthly savings... Please help!

So the Fed now wants to hike to 4.6% and keep it there through 2023!

That's a lot higher than the 4% expected and will certainly affect the economy a lot harder not just in the short term but also next year and beyond.

Borrowing rates for consumers and companies will go up much higher and stay high which obviously will hurt spending therefore slowing down growth.

Higher rates means for most companies it becomes a lot more difficult to borrow money to finance further growth hence companies are preparing for the slowdown and scaling back.

Also the variable rate debt lots of companies have accumulated over the past years of easy money will really start to hurt now as this type of debt is linked to rates.

It's important to understand this is not just a short term effect. Rate hikes have impact on companies many quarters after they take affect. Most talking heads in the media but also permabulls here on reddit seem to ignore that and just keep talking up the markets so beware. A short term rebound does not mean it can't go lower afterwards!

Would not be surprised to see another short bear market pump before it goes much lower again once companies start revising their earnings forecast to the downside.

Powell trying to talk up the markets afterwards clearly doesn't help anymore. He should stick to what FOMC members have decided instead of trying to give it a ""rosy"" spin.

Final point, so we now have a problem in the housing market, credit market (too much borrowing going on) and in the equity markets (earnings compression coming). Not sure how that combo will end but don't have a good feeling about this. Hope this won't be 2008 all over again or worse.

That's in a nutshell what the Fed decided today and its future impact on the markets. Stay careful and don't be a mindless sheep.",finance,1663784642

personalfinance,"$24,000 in Debt - $20,000 Of It On One Card; Can Barely Afford the Minimum Payment; Interest is 80% of Min Payment; Credit is 625; Have Not Found Decent Consolidation Loan","Hello!  I know you probably get these posts all the time so I want to make this as brief as I can.  After this short intro I think I will make a bulleted list of key points.  I am in survival mode and have addressed what got me here and continue to address it.  I more or less had major expenses arise get me in debt - mindset shifted, mental illness led to a 3 month period of addictive spending.  My spending is minimal now, but I can barely make it month-to-month.


-$24,000 Total Debt ($20,000 on 1 card, $4,000 on PayPal Credit; much with deferred interest).

- My card with $20,000 is the Amazon Rewards Signature Visa Card From Chase and it is maxed.  It has an APR of about 24% or 25%.

- My monthly income is only $2060 post taxes (but I have hope for a job soon with a $10,000 annual or $5/hr raise within a month).

- My minimum payment this month for the Chase Card is $596.

- My interest charge last month was $405.

- I have a friend who is a VP at a bank who is giving me some advice as we go.  He recommended debt consolidation.

- I have anywhere from $4,000-$6,000 in ""goods"" to sell on Ebay/Mercari/Marketplace; however, that is a part-time job and I am working full time and also moving into a new apartment on the 29th of this month.

- My Dad is willing to give me a low interest rate loan of unknown $ value (to be found out today maybe).


These points are more akin to my current situation in the immediate:


- My credit score was 780 at one point, it is now 625 solely due to credit card utilization %.  I currently have NO late payments, but this could change.

- My Chase payment was due Sunday; however, I called and asked for an extension.  I was told a late fee may be charged, but that I wouldn't have a late payment sent to the credit bureau if made by today, and if I couldn't today, to call back again and they could make it the 25th?  I still don't have funds so I plan to call back today.  This is the Chase ""Collections"" Department I believe.

- I plan to call my Dad today about loan details.  If I had to guess, the loan would be $5,000.  No way it will be all $20,000.

- I used credit karma and wallethub to scan for potential debt consolidation loans and none were favorable, the best had an APR of 30% - 5% more than my current CC.

- Debt transfers to 0% APR cards seems worthless as I won't find a CC to approve me with a $20,000 limit.  But I could be wrong.

- I had planned to call Chase back and discuss an INTEREST FREEZE deal and payment plan; however, I know this hurts your credit, but I may need this to survive.

- My plan is to get an extension through Sunday and hopefully sell $500 worth of products on ebay to make my minimum payment this month.  I doubt I can get a promissory note signed for a loan from my Dad before then.

- My banker friend says to try and sell everything ASAP, get my debt down and credit up a tad to find a better consolidation loan; however, with my debt to income ratio (I have no spending money really) and the monthly minimum payment, I am being eaten alive by the interest and this is proving harder than previously thought.


Does anyone have any sage wisdom on where I should go forward?  I am attempting to avoid bankruptcy at all costs.  Especially since I have goods to sell, a possible loan from my dad, and a new job coming.  I just struggle with which approach to take, the order, etc.  If I get a loan from my dad, do I use the entire thing to pay directly to the Chase card??  My PayPal account interest is much lower than my Chase and has many deferred interest plans if I hit the minimum, although it is a large monthly payment itself near $400 (but decreases each month).

I have heard of debt relief solutions but there are so many and I feel like for every 1 legit company there are 10 sharks out there as well.

I appreciate ANY advice available at all.  Thank you!",finance,1663785855

&amp;#x200B;

I did use the search bar and gained some knowledge but I am looking for some other insights from some of you. I am currently sitting on about 60k worth of equity in my house. The wife and I want to use some of it for one of two options.

&amp;#x200B;

Option one: the plot next to us is up for sale. its just under 4 acres and has never been logged, so there is a possibility I could make back some money if I purchased it, although not enough to break even. I can probably buy this land for 30k. So I can gain more property, and an asset I could sell later (or give to one of my kids if they want to be my neighbors later in life). I like the idea of a HELOC, but I am hesitant to buy something so pricey on a variable interest rate, so I guess I'd go with a equity loan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Option two: use a HELOC to A. consolidate some debt, no more than 15k and B. use about 8k to build on a barn on my property, since we don't have a garage yet, but I'm not shelling out 80k for a big ass garage at the moment.  The pros to this would be my property would be worth more with a large outbuilding for storage and my stuff would stay out of the weather. I have a decent understanding of a HELOC, but I need to do more research before I'm comfortable with a variable rate loan.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize both my options are wildly different, I guess I'm just looking for some outside perspective/opinions that will make me look at my options from a different viewpoint that perhaps I did not consider.",finance,1663788192

We both work for the same local government with a defined benefit pension. 2.5% a year, max 80% with the average of highest 5 years salaries. Minimum retirement age is 62, or 55 with 30 years of service. This means I can retire at age 56 with the full 80%, as I'm 8 years into the pension (10 overall). We don't pay into social security so that's eliminated. We have a 457 (similar to 401k) but no match. My salary is in low 90s. My husband is 7 years in, salary is 90. We vested at 5 years so that's secured already. We own a home, 7 years in to that mortgage. We live in a HCOL city but we bought our home before the crazy prices luckily. 

However, I've recently been offered an amazing opportunity with a federal agency. It would require to move to another state (higher cost of living) initially and then eventually I can do overseas as well, which is very appealing. The salary I'm being offered is a few thousand more than here, right at 6 figures. My husband would have to start over as his line of work right now is not available in this new state. He'd have to find a regular job, mostly likely remote since eventually we plan to move again. 

Am I crazy to even consider moving? We both are close to 6 figures currently, and with the pension and home, we are very financially secure. And we can retire relatively early as stated above. The retirement is mostly what's keeping me here, as the federal pension (1% per year, highest 3 year average)/SS/401 (TSP) is nowhere near as good as the defined benefit + 457 we have here. Or is it? I'm stuck on taking this leap.

personalfinance,What to do regarding a lien for unpaid state taxes?,"Husband has worked in Maryland since we moved to DC in 2014. Long story short when he started his job, the tax paperwork was very confusing and got filled out incorrectly. It remained that way when we actually moved to Maryland the next year. As a result he has owed taxes every year to the IRS and I guess the state as well. I did not know about any of this until we got married and bought our house last year. He had been on payment plans with the IRS (and we thought the state too) and has since fixed the paperwork with his employer. He is now paid off with federal taxes.

Last year we got a notice in the mail from state of Maryland for his taxes owed in 2019 and 2020. At that time we reached out to the comptroller inquiring about paying these taxes, and made the payments. At one point I asked if everything was clear for 2020 and all other years for that matter, and received a response that there was a remaining balance of $450. No big deal, we can pay that off.

Imagine my shock when we then this week received a letter saying there is a lien on our house for unpaid taxes from 2014-2019 totaling over $30k. We immediately started freaking out and did some digging. Husband thought he was on a payment plan with the state as well. Come to find out there was a payment plan set up in 2018 for 31 payments (unclear about which years it was supposed to cover), but was apparently cancelled in 2019 after about 12 payments. We don’t understand why, the bank account remains the same and he swears he did not cancel. I believe him, as the website is so hard to navigate and I do not see him digging into that to find the plan and cancel for no reason (it was hard enough finding it in the first place, and I had to create an online account for him last year to pay off 2019/2020- he said he thinks he set up the plan via phone). At any rate, he wouldn’t have cancelled it on purpose. 

Another thing that doesn’t add up is the amount that was being deducted was $4 short of the supposed amount. And the total amount that the plan was to cover does not match up with the tax liability from any year according to their site.

We are of course freaking out. The lowest payment plan on the website is $1000/month, which we definitely do not have. We were already struggling despite not spending a lot. Where do we even begin? We set up an appointment with the comptrollers office to discuss options tomorrow, but should I be meeting with a CPA or another 3rd party who specializes in this kind of thing first?

In the meantime we are trying to find all documentation related to his state taxes including returns, printing the emails exchanged with the comptroller, and looking for more sources of income. And yes both me and husband realize how irresponsible he has been with his taxes. Paperwork/taxes/etc is confusing (for us), and yes he was wildly irresponsible to let this slip by for so long. But we are regular people just trying to work and get by, and really need some direction as to where to even begin to try and deal with this mess. Thank you",finance,1663790999

personalfinance,What is the smartest way to use my money?,"You may have to break this down for me as simply as possible. (Sorry….)
I’ve worked on becoming more financially literate the last few months. I’m a 30-year-old female. I’m just starting my journey, but I want to be rich one day and set up my family for the best life possible.

I found a temporary loophole in my job. I’ve been living paycheck to paycheck my whole life. This loophole (which may only be available for the next 3 years) is allowing me to earn and save an extra 10-12k a month (after taxes). 

My husband and I have $43,000 in student loan debt AFTER the loan forgiveness. I currently have 21k saved in a checking account from using this loophole method the past 2 months.

What is the smartest thing for me to do with this money? Pay off all debt first, save/invest it, or a combo of both?

Important points:
1. I have 30k in retirement . This is temporarily on hold. So not currently contributing.
2. No emergency savings or savings account. The money saved in my checking isn’t growing.
3. My husband has no retirement account 
4. I have no college savings for my 7-year-old daughter
5. We owe 170k left on our house. Want to rent it out and upgrade to a larger house in the future. This will require a $150k down payment.

Extra Info: My “loophole” is nothing illegal. I just got my Master’s and I’m a trauma surgery nurse. We’re short staffed, so the hospital gives me a $100-$750 bonus for every trauma shift I work. We have a lot of traveling RNs. The travelers will pay me $50-$150 per trauma shift I take from them (of their own money). I am picking up 15 plus shifts a month. I am then paid double my wage for every hour I work on a trauma shift. I then get other bonuses on top of that. It’s super hard work, but the pay is great. I’m going to hustle until this gravy train goes dry.",finance,1663791774

personalfinance,Help with credit card debt,"Obviously if this isn’t the right place to post, just let me know!!

Looking for any and all advice—I am in about $35k of credit card debt and every time I try to address it I get overwhelmed &amp; anxious. My spending habits come from an upbringing where I never learned financial health or literacy, combined with the stupid, naive, and materialistic choices that got me here. Things got really bad in graduate school when I had no income and I just told myself it would all be fine. I chose to ignore the problem by making the monthly payment, but now I am pretty much maxed out on all cards (4) and my credit score has taken a really bad hit the past couple months. I just started a job making about $68k before taxes. As far as I can tell, my options are 
1. Debt settlement—I am scared what this means for my future financial health
2. Consolidated debt loan—doesn’t seem to be a real option given my credit score and like percentage use on my cards
3. Avalanche technique—frankly, I don’t really see this getting me anywhere due to my interest rates

I have been trying to look for side hustles to find another income stream as possibly another way to attack my debt, but I’m having a hard time finding things besides survey junkie or other similar low-reward “side hustles.” I haven’t found something yet but I’m very open to finding another income source, obviously not trying to get rich quick, just make some cash to help. 

Lastly, I know this is my fault and that my financial literacy and spending habits are shit. I want to get a consolidation loan and cut up all my credit cards and start fresh, but I’m not so naive to think my spending and budget habits will change overnight. If anyone has any advice on what to do immediately to most help my situation, as well as long term how to not let this become a cycle, please please let me know. 

PS—no one in my personal life knows about this situation. I don’t know how to address it without judgment and yelling from parents/siblings/boyfriend. I want to manage it on my own.",finance,1663794991
news,Fed rate hike: US interest rates hit 14-year high in inflation battle,,finance,1663795270
CryptoCurrency,FED is the new FUD!,"FED raised interest rates by 0.75% for the third consecutive time to tame multi-decade highs in inflation. Three 75-basis-point rate hikes in a row is unprecedented! The rate hike brings the central bank’s benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, to a new range of 3.0% to 3.25% — its highest level since 2008 — from a current range between 2.25% and 2.5%.

None of this is surprising and was well expected given the recent inflation data, combined with the upcoming mid-term election and offense that Republican party has razed over Dems.

Now, what is frustrating is the approach the ""government system"" is taking to manage the situation. The President says inflation has peaked, everyone believes pandemic is over, war pundits don't think Russia has much runway to keep fighting and on the other FED increases interest rate by 0.75% with possibility to increase more in the future!! 

FED is not clear in its communication and there is no reconciliation with what is being communicated across different branches and offices of government. So, basically causing a massive FUD that is making the entire situation look as dark as one can imagine. We are witnessing a poor leadership currently from government, no doubt they have tough job at hand but way to solve is more clarity, not more confusion and FUD.

Hope FED can get out of the FUD mode and start doing something more constructive!",cryptocurrency,1663795415

personalfinance,Question about a particular step in the flowchart,"My wife and I are currently at the point where we're evaluating the merits of a Roth vs. Traditional IRA in the context of our personal financial situation and we're supposed to max the yearly contributions accordingly.

We exceed the MAGI limits for Traditional IRA contribution deductions, but we're below the phaseout for Roth contributions, so that answers that.

My question is this: with our marginal federal and state income tax brackets being 22% and 8.75%, respectively, should we still be maxing out our Roth IRAs at this step as the flowchart suggests, or should we be hitting our 15% gross savings target with increased pre-tax 401k/457 contributions?

If we follow the flowchart exactly, we should only be contributing more than the employer match after the Roth IRAs are maxed, but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to do our whole 15% as pre-tax through our employers. I'd be shocked if our effective tax rate in retirement exceeds the marginal rate we're in now, especially if we eventually move out of Oregon and pay lower or zero state income tax.

But why would people invest in the dollar or fed reserve notes when they are the ones causing this?Temporarily the dollar is strong as people SCRAMBLE to pay higher debt obligations but trust me it is not safe to stay in fiat currencies too long as an investment.

personalfinance,Bit of an investment goal/budget/401k and house purchase feasibility question,"**Facts**: 

* Alright so I've read the JL Collins book on the simple path to wealth. I'm 30 and hoping to have more income in the next few months. Feels like $52k is the new $30k especially with rent eating my check.
* I've been getting $52k salary, I put away $200 a month into savings account at a bank with a nice 2% interest rate. I put $50 into an HSA account through work and I put $80 into a work provided Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 fund.
* I am a student with 2 years left college, my work path could get me a raise to $60k if I can get hired elsewhere, I'm trying. Degree path could get me $100k and more.
* Then I keep $2k in the checking just as a float just in case.
* I pay $200 a month on groceries, $1400 a month on rent (fuck me with rent, fucking scam, and this is cheap). Put together gas, electric, car insurance, fuel for driving, that's another $300 a month. 
* I have a $4k out of $13k car loan payment left. It's at 6% so I want to get it paid off asap. I throw $300 a month at it. Started loan in 2020 right when covid started.

**The big Question:** 

* So I have $6k in savings. I want to invest just $3k into a VTSAX. I want to make sure it's all invested into a total index stock fund if I have that right. I am unsure if that makes sense to do that if I already have the target retirement fund. I want to make a short 5 year investment and have enough cash to withdraw and use on an eventual house payment. I imagine this is better than having a lot of cash sitting in a savings account.

 

**Two  straight forward questions:**

* I was informed that the Vanguard Target Retirement fund can be adjusted to invest into the total index fund, I do not know how to adjust that.
* Lastly when I go to adjust my savings rate I get the option of the employee 401k or the employee roth 401k deferral. I have no idea which one I should be choosing to deposit into.",finance,1663802206

stocks,Hong Kong Heng Seng index hits 10+ year low,"(Bloomberg) -- Broad selling on concerns about the Federal Reserve’s relentless campaign to fight inflation and growing US-China tensions sent Hong Kong stocks tumbling to decade lows. 

The benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped as much 2.6% on Thursday to touch the lowest since December 2011, dragged down by technology shares. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which entered a bear market in the previous session, pared losses after earlier approaching 2008 lows.

Risk-off sentiment deepened across markets after the Fed, following a 75 basis point increase, indicated another hike of the same magnitude could be in store for November. Hong Kong’s stock benchmark has now shed more than 22% this year, extending the 14% loss in 2021, as China’s strict Covid Zero curbs and trade tensions with the US hurt the prospect for businesses in the region. 

“The Fed has clearly signaled in its projections that they will accept multi-year below trend growth and move interest rates higher and for longer,” said Redmond Wong, market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “Hong Kong, being a small open economy, is more vulnerable to slower global growth.”

The moves track the tumble in Chinese stocks traded in the US on Wednesday to a nearly four-month low. 

China has been ramping up its rhetoric toward Taiwan ahead of its leadership gathering in October, saying it has the patience to someday bring the island nation under control. Beijing’s close ties with Moscow have also been under scrutiny by Western leaders and could bring sanctions if China increases support. 

Earlier gains this year spurred by Beijing’s policy stimulus have failed to last, as jittery investors responded to every piecemeal development in China’s Covid policy and regulation with heavy selling.

CryptoCurrency,The Most ASIC-Resistant Pool-Resistant Crypto from 2013 You've Never Heard of: Gridcoin,"I see a lot of talk here about ASIC-resistance. For those that don't know, ASICs are specialized computers purpose-built for mining and are widely used to mine Bitcoin. The downside of ASICs is that production of the ASICs themselves trends towards centralization. CPU-mineable coins like XMR using algorithms like RandomX have built a name for themselves as being ""ASIC-resistant"" and they are. But as traditional PoW coins, they do still suffer from the problem of all hashpower inevitably centralizing into pools. Though tools like P2Pool have helped prevent this to some extent, they are still not quite there in terms of scalability or profit per watt. We should all be aiming for ASIC-resistance, pool resistance, and decentralization, it's an obvious win for everybody.

One coin I never see mentioned in this discussion but absolutely should be is Gridcoin. With Gridcoin, consensus is handled by a proof-of-stake layer, but most coins are minted as a result of computational work, making it a sort of hybrid system. The best part is that the computational work is people crunching data for open scientific research projects working on everything from disease cures to mapping the galaxy. There are good pro and con arguments to be made for traditional proof of work, but work that benefits scientific research is a clear win for everyone. And projects are selected by Gridcoin user's themselves through on-chain votes on which projects are incentivized with newly minted coins. This means any researcher who needs gobloads of computational power can just make a poll and if voted in (if they can convince people their research is valuable), they now get it all for free. It's also the only coin I know of with a functional federated oracle system and a essentially zero-cost entry proof-of-stake system. No need to have access to an exchange, just fire up your CPU/GPU and to earn your first few GRC.

Because the research projects are constantly changing, they are completely ASIC-resistant. In the absolute worst case scenario, if an ASIC we're developed, the project could be banned from the network, and as a side benefit now there's an ASIC out there for protein folding or something. And because of the way the currency is minted, there is *zero* benefit to aggregating mining power into pools. Some pools exist to simplify the mining process, but they do not grant you access to any more coins than if you had mined on your own. That is HUGE.

This coin has been around since like.. 2013, Bitcoin's first block was mined in 2009, Eth didn't happen till 2015. I guess you never see about it posted here because it's never on some crazy rally, isn't ""partnered"" with some big institution, and just doesn't have the VC backing or cult following other coins have. But it has been quietly doing its thing for years. And I wish more people knew about it because it's my favorite coin.",cryptocurrency,1663833387

personalfinance,Should I sell my house in December 2022?,"Hello, I am in the Army and moving to Wisconsin for 10 months from Idaho in January. After the 10 months my wife and I will move back to Idaho for the foreseeable future.

We bought our current home in Idaho for 230k in 2020. It’s now selling for around 350k but was at 398k in April. It continues to drop each month.

We want to sell the home because we will rent in Wisconsin and don’t want to pay for rent and a mortgage simultaneously. We were thinking of renting our home but trying to rent a home for 10 months specifically is kind of tricky. We would also have to find a property management company. This is always still an option in our minds. The other issue is trying to sell the home with these rising interest rates, seems scary. 

We want to rebuy a home when we return after the 10 months, ideally closer to where I work than before. I’m worried that interest rates on a new home will suck though. I do have a VA home Lon available to use and we have a combined income of 140k a year. 

Should we just suck it up and keep/ rent the home and move back in when we return from Wisconsin and wait for better interest rates to sell or should we sell the home and buy when we return?",finance,1663839101

CryptoCurrency,Capitulation to 10-14K or not? It is looking more and more likely that history will repeat,"A week ago, I highlighted here that, as shown in the chart below, we were at the same percentage drawdown (\~70%) since all time high relative to the 2013-2015 and 2017-2018 bear markets at the same moment in time. Hence, if we follow history, one would expect a similar capitulaion move to about 84% drawdown, which is around $11K per Bitcoin. I noted in that post that there are also reasons why one would not expect a further drop: instutitional adoption is incredibly high, Bitcoin did not climb as high from the bottom relative to previous bear markets, and every bottom indicator in this space has flashed. Given recent developments, however, a repeat of this capitulation move is becoming more and more likely. Let me elaborate.

[The Bitcoin Returns after All Time High Across the Different Bitcoin Bear Markets \(Source: Sam Rule\)](https://preview.redd.it/7cznlqnq4ep91.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0473788369fa00fd103992fed6e7b265933aaab)

Currently, Bitcoin is struggling to hold the 20k level and has closed many weeks and even months below the weekly 200 moving average (MA). This has never happened before. We even rejected off of the 200 weekly MA several times. This level has been a key support in the past and it looks broken. I cannot imagine how the 200 weekly MA could be retaken anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin Chart on Weekly Timeframe \(200 Weekly MA in Green\)](https://preview.redd.it/dcmo0g1m6ep91.png?width=1389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb93e1f59aa3724a09aa8d5f711d2ad4654bbbf1)

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite chart to keep an eye on is the total market cap chart, which represents the entire cryptocurrency space. What caught my eye is how we perfectly did a backtest of the 2017/2018 peak during the June 2020 3AC/Luna crash (highlighted with horizontal purple line), quickly recovering the 200 weekly MA. We are currently rejecting off of the 200 weekly MA. We have never rejected off of the 200 MA level before during a backtest, although we have spent max. 3 weeks below it in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bitcoin Monthly chart is particularly scary, and note that the higher the timeframe the more important the chart. We are currently rejecting off of the lower ends of the bodies of the three previous months - which is basically the 20k level- with a giant wick above the red monthly candle showing selling pressure there. We have 8 days to move up, or we are about to enter a world of pain, likely falling back to the next support somewhere around 13k/14k. There is basically air inbetween these two levels on higher timeframes.

[Bitcoin Chart on Monthly Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/inp5ljsg3ep91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f5a53b3995ea8eb785f396aff66a5a67656afbd)

&amp;#x200B;

But Beyonderr, crypto has never seen this type of poor economic environment, so why are crypto charts relevant? Well I do like the data and historical perspective because it gives *some* information. But you are right, perhaps stocks are more indicative nowdays. This is likely why at the moment, we are heavily correlated with stocks, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index. This correlation has never been so strong before. So much for our decoupling.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Correlation Between Bitcoin\/Ethereum and the S&amp;P 500](https://preview.redd.it/0wg337s48ep91.jpg?width=4096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8544154b4ef1e70e38883e6512f7e249f72f8f)

And how are stocks doing then? Overall, stocks are looking terrible. We are close to the June lows on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. If we breach those, expect Bitcoin to set a new lower low and likely capitulate (again). The Nasdaq weekly chart is pictured below, for instance. We are about 600 points away from the June bottom and piercing the June bottom means that we are below the 200 weekly MA. You can see on the left what happens when that level is broken. Why might that be likely? Well, there is little to no indication that the global markets are going to get better anytime soon, although there is a glimmer of hope in that inflation might have topped in the US and that the price of oil is coming down. However, Europe is in trouble and inflation here has only been rising. The war does not look like it will end anytime soon either. Moreover, dont forget that winter is coming.

Lastly, how bad is it? Well, in terms of economy and inflation, the US is doing good relative to almost all other countries. But even in the US, just how dire the situation is (i.e. how high inflation is) can be derived from how fast the FED increased interest rates from the start of increasing rates relative to previous economic downturns. Faster than ever. And Inflation so far didnt really go down in a significant manner. The FED even said we should expect more hikes, likely until the 2004 level if not higher. Oops.

[Change in Fed Funds Rate &amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/aoqfsp8dkep91.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be0f811c653e34ca3b4b36533854e2830ee6a348)

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I wanted to share some data here, so it might inform someone's decisions going forward. I think a key takeaway is that new lows are likely and to just follow the stock market for now because that provides more valid data. The correlation is so high with BTC (and ETH) anyways. Make sure to look beyond this post, though, because I am also just a random person on the internets; I do not want to be responsible for anyone's investments. I dont like selling here because every bottom indicator has flashed in this space. But I definitely try to save up fiat -as far as Europe's living costs allow me- to buy a bigger dip if that situation presents itself. That would likely be a golden opportunity with a long enough perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

PS. If it goes down, we can always just adjust our charts.

CryptoCurrency,So I asked a lawyer what happens to my crypto if the SEC won. This is what they said,"So real quick, this isn't legal advice as I'm not a lawyer. But I asked a few in a casual talk about this. I asked

1. What is the chances of the SEC winning any of these cases or any future case with crypto?
2. Assuming SEC does win, what can I do with my crypto?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# For 1:

They said the SEC is highly unlikely to win any court case. Recent developments in the XRP case shown

https://preview.redd.it/tfh8sdrmqep91.png?width=1203&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2432fd567a477c99246d50a3f69927585cfc00de

In short, when security laws went from state to federal, the federal basically grabbed the general on what states called an investment contract.

What the laws state level in the 1920s basically said (again this is apart of the XRP case).

https://preview.redd.it/bwzrrfo6rep91.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2869f278ccd6a85ba83d62344bc84b307152a36a

https://preview.redd.it/stppxj34sep91.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69255350ca357cd4a731a87bd5fcc990a88ceb6d

In short, if there was no contract then it is an asset. Like if you have no way to sue AND WIN if a crypto or whatever pivots. Then it is an asset. The crypto company if it has no legal obligation to the buyer. Then it must be an asset.

Note I got the screenshots from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNUuw2qTbjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNUuw2qTbjo)

He explained it a good bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it turns out everything the SEC said was an unregistered security prior both in and out of crypto. Could be brought to question.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# For 2

If you're an accredited investor, then it looks like you're good to go.

But lets point out what is an accredited investor to show how much BS this is. To be one you must meet one of the following.

1. You must have an average yearly income over $200,000  ($300,000 for joint income) for the last two years or working in the financial industry.
2. You have a net worth exceeding $1 million, either individually or jointly with their spouse.
3. You are a general partner, executive officer, or director for the company that is issuing the unregistered securities.
4. If it is a private business development company or an organization with assets exceeding $5 million.
5. If an entity consists of equity owners who are accredited investors, the entity itself is an accredited investor. However, an organization cannot be formed with the sole purpose of purchasing specific securities.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically if you are rich, you can get away with a bunch of things. Where if you're not rich, then the law is after you. It's a class system (and seriously. I wonder if challenged if this would hold up in court. Like it seems to be pure discrimination against given classes of people, and in no way prove or disprove if one knows how to make a smart trade)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, for the 99.999% of us that is a peasant. More than less we are screwed.

* You can return it for a full refund from the broker
* You can keep any interest unless you made income. The income is deducted from the interest
* You can't sell it legally
* You should file a claim against the broker for offering or selling an unregistered security

&amp;#x200B;

So more than less, you can get a refund and take the broker to court.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Note: again I'm not a lawyer and this isn't legal advice. If it turns out the SEC does win any of this. I suggest talking to a lawyer anyways.",cryptocurrency,1663852981

TLT currently offers a 3.74% yield to maturity but the fed just said they anticipate a fed funds rate of 4.6% by 2023, so 1% higher than TLT currently is.

From research, I've read that a 1% change in rate is assoicated with a 15% drop in prices meaning TLT ""should"" drop from 105 to 89.25. Is my understanding correct? If not, what am I missing?

-young at 26

-just under 6 figure income in a very stable job

-5k in medical debt currently. This will get paid off in about a year as a paycheck reduction. It does not accumulate interest. No other debt

-no family to support

-have 8 k in emergency fund and 5k to cover my credit card which gets paid off every month. Both are in savings accounts in my bank

-I also have plenty of money in a none retirement portfolio as an additional emergency location. This is where my house down payment and future car payments go. 

-not planning on buying a house for probably at least 2 more years

-might go back to school for medicine. If this happened I would probably take out loans and let my portfolio ride to try to out pace the interest rate on them assuming it holds at 5%. This would not start for at least 2 more years",finance,1663859001

personalfinance,Which option leaves the child better off at the age of 65?,"I'm going to start working on a project that compares the outcomes of the following options for a child:  


1. Contribute to a 529 account for 18 years and use the money to pay for all of the kid's college expenses.
2. Contribute to an individual brokerage account for 18 years and let it compound until retirement (age 65)

Some details:

* $500/mo contributions to both
* 8%/yr avg return in brokerage account
* 4.99% Federal student loan interest rate
* $55,000 annual salary post college (avg) 
* $35,000 annual cost of attendance for university (4yrs)

The question is which option leaves the child better off financially at age 65. The 2nd option means the kid would take on Federal student loans to pay for school and pay taxes on the gains in the brokerage account at age 65. I'm planning to run an analysis of the future values of these options including the amortization of the loans and other details. 

I'm not asking for a direct answer to the question, since that'll be my job, but what are some important things I might want to consider/factor in to this analysis? Or just any initial opinions on the two options. Thanks!",finance,1663862568

personalfinance,May have messed up my wife's 401k rollover,"I'm helping my wife rollover her 401k from a former employer to IRAs but I may have made a mistake. I'd like some advice so as to 1) minimize or avoid penalties and taxes, and 2) complete the rollover.

She had pre-tax contributions and earnings, after-tax contributions and earnings, and also an on-going 401k loan. We rolled-over the bulk of her 401k to a Rollover IRA. We did not roll-over the full amount because the admin indicated that doing so could close out the loan and subjecting it to taxes and penalty. The '401k pre-tax monies to Rollover IRA' part went smoothly and I don't have concerns.

Her after-tax contributions (not the associated after-tax earnings) were paid to her in the form of a check. My plan was to deposit the check into her Roth IRA. This is maybe where I may have made a mistake. I got distracted (we are in the process of selling/buying a home and moving) and I had forgotten my plan was to put the after-tax contributions into the Roth IRA. I instead deposited it into our joint checking account because we were at one point considering doing that. I wasn't getting clear advice on putting it into anything other than a Roth IRA so I decided it would be safest to roll it into the Roth IRA; that is until I screwed up and forgot that was my preferred plan.

So now the after-tax contributions check is deposited in our joint checking but it is on-hold for the next week waiting to clear for some reason. She didn't endorse the check because she is currently out-of-state and she didn't need to as the funds were going into her joint checking account. Perhaps that's why it is on hold.

Appreciate any advice on how to complete the rollover to the Roth IRA and avoid penalties and taxes. Nothing shady going on here... just an honest mistake I'd like to unwind. And she's fully-briefed on the matter as I try to resolve it.

BTW... I've reached out to a tax professional for advice, but I'm getting no responses as of yet since they seem to be slammed with some corporation filing deadline.

We are in our mid-40s. California, if it matters.

Edit: Thanks for the advice! Seems pretty consistent too among commenters, which is comforting. Appreciate the time. I'll work on the transfer to the Roth IRA once the funds settle.",finance,1663863024
economy,Higher Rates = Higher Inflation?,"Is it possible that in today's economy, higher rates may actually lead to even higher inflation?

Interest expenses are just like any other input cost.  If you are a business, and you have pricing power, and your costs are going higher (interest expenses in this case), wouldn't this lead you to simply raise prices more to maintain profitability levels, especially if backlogs are still at record levels?

This is what I'm seeing in my world (manufacturing).  I believe the Fed is relying on higher rates to stifle consumer demand, especially for big ticket items like autos and homes, but the bottom line is we are still living in a supply constrained world.  If anything, it seems like lower rates would incentivize increased capital expenditures and therefore increase production capacity

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoins energy consumption in perspective,"Bitcoin, and more broadly cryptocurrencies in general, have been facing backlash from buttcoiners and politicians alike due to their “high” energy consumption. Bitcoin mining uses 150 terawatt hours of power each year. This is a seemingly high number, high enough to generate headlines like, “Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than several countries”, but has anyone looked at the numbers recently?


YouTube - occupying 2.5% of the entire global electricity usage it consumes 600TWh annually. Bitcoin uses 1/4th the total energy as YouTube.


Netflix - has an estimated energy consumption of 94 TWh annually. Bitcoin uses 1.6x the energy annually. (Additionally private estimates are 200x larger than the figures reporting consumption released by Netflix themselves…) 


Gaming (all platforms globally) - uses an estimated 105 TWh annually. Bitcoin uses 1.43x the total energy as video games.


Global banking systems - use an estimated 240 TWh annually. Bitcoin consumes .6 the energy of banks. 


These kind of posts haven’t been popular in a while so here are just a few comparisons with updated numbers. Overall BTC uses a boatload of electricity, yet at the same time it’s consumption is dwarfed by other tech giants and industries. Making strides towards a greener world doesn’t mean lowering electrical consumption. Realistically it’s only going to increase. It means creating more access to renewable sources.",cryptocurrency,1663863238

stocks,Ocean Freight Rates Weight On The Overall CPI,"Hi all, unfortunately i dont have a research to offer to you all, but i work as a Freight Forwarder in South America and previously i worked at HSBC Global Markets.

One of the correlations ive seen and noticed is that the evolution of the cpi, not only in US rather than the whole world, was due to unprecedent spike on ocean freight rates + logistics costs (warehouse, truckings, trains, etc): Basically the logistics costs have surged in 2021 and first half of 2022 almost 10 fold during this period. 

For almost every country in the world, the main country / Supllier is China. A container full of items (household, toys, food, products for industry, construction equipment and panels such as wires, steel, glass, plastics) cost depending on the quality around USD 15000-USD 50,000; that is the FOB value of the cargo. 

On top of that during this period move the container from China to your country spiked more than 1000% in some cases. In sojth america we paid usd 15,000/HQ and i know in US the value toped around usd 25,000/HQ. 

just make the math and see how much this weight on the overall CIF costs of the products. For me that was no doubt, one of the major reasons of the Global Inflation we are seeing today. You cann add also add up increase on energy costs

But that was past. Of course, with such a spike on costs, and eventually on our daily life purchases, demand decreased sharply. Consuption went from good to services also as the post covid lckdown, and the thing is that today ocean freight costs reduced more than 50% from those highs at least in Europe, South America and US . 

So, my question is for you; what do you think will happen with inflation if such trend continues?

Do you think this can post some relief to cpi and curve down expectations of FED rate increases?",finance,1663864113
stocks,What's the overall sentiment around $MSFT right now? Because $MSFT social activity is rising as $MSFT dips below June lows.,"It's the day after FOMC and markets are selling off. $MSFT, however, briefly dipped below its June lows and has since recovered, making it one of the few large-cap stocks in the green today. 

That being said, this dip below support could be a deviation before pushing higher or the beginning of much more downside ahead. Regardless, something of interest to note right now is that the number of MSFT social mentions, as tracked by LunarCrush, is showing sustained growth with more and more people creating posts and talking about Microsoft Corp (MSFT) right now at these price levels. I find this interesting because, for the first time since $MSFT's ATH back in Nov 2021, the social activity around $MSFT is trending up again, after months of trending down. 

So according to this data, there is a peak of interest in MSFT right now and it continues to grow. Whether this peak of interest in MSFT is short-sighted or long-sighted is up to interpretation but is interesting nonetheless.

What do you guys think about this? Is $MSFT's rising social activity a bullish sign? Are people fearful right now? Are they wanting to buy?

personalfinance,Exiting the military - need a place to live. What would you do?,"Greetings finance boyo and goyos,

I will be exiting the military in about 2-3 months. Currently live off base in an apartment that I’m going to ditch here shortly to move an hour north. I have a job lined up an hour north of here as well, so that is why I’m moving there, and the issue i seem to be having is whether or not to buy a house, buy a cheap condo, or rent.

Rent- 1100-1600 depending on 1BR or 2BR (may have a buddy move in with me later down the road, but not at the start)

Houses - can afford around 300k and below, puts me at a payment of 1100-1900

Cheap condo/ townhome - 100k for bare bones to 260k fully decked out, garage and backyard townhome

Background info: 

I’m trying to avoid overpaying for a house and getting f***ed by the rising interest rates right now. Im tracking the housing market will need 8-12 months to correct their goofy ass prices based on increased interest rates.

Option 1: i can rent for 1100-1600 until the housing market corrects

Option 2: i can buy a 275-300k home and put 100k down in order to decrease my payments and the amount of interest i would pay (smaller payments = i can afford extra payments on principle and lower the interest paid on the loan)

Option 3: i can buy a cheap condo or townhouse  for ~100k to 150k in cash, and my only bills would be the HOA and utilities, and i could sit and chill here until the market corrects, to which I would vacate this place, and rent it out for passive income, and move into a better house or town home.  The issue with this option is every realtor and every person i've ever talked to IRL about buying condos are always against it, saying spending that much money on a condo is never worth the venture, and that condos just don't appreciate in value.

Finance brain tells me its a terrible time to purchase a home, but my choices are purchase a home and hold onto it through the correction and get absolutely destroyed by the 6-7% ridiculous interest rate, or rent at ridiculous prices and throw money away.",finance,1663867237

From everything I've researched and from several folks invested in real estate, this is when you want to buy.

That being said, I've been reading more and more on the ""100% financing"" through credit unions and it sounds smart, largely because I feel like it'd allow us to keep our savings (about 10k right now) for repairs/upgrades in a home when we moved in, and we can still refinance when rates lower in 5-6 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Total liquidations topped out at $342.66 Million

* $135.71M in Shorts were liquidated (39.49% of total liquidations)

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast to u/ChemicalGreek's post (from which this post is inspired), at the time of that post the liquidation percentage leading up to the FOMC meeting was that 79.81% of liquidations were longs and 20.19% were shorts, where those holding Long positions were more likely to get liquidated. What this post shows is that liquidations were more evenly distributed post FOMC meetings **relative to the lead up to the FOMC meeting**, where whether you held Long or Short positions you were more likely to get liquidated despite the position you held. Though with that said and when these numbers are considered in isolation, you were still more likely to be liquidated if you held Long positions as opposed to Short positions.",cryptocurrency,1663868501
Bitcoin,Bitcoin and the Transition of the Global Trade System,"The current news from around the globe including Argentina, Pakistan, Haiti, Sri Lanka, Lebanon and across Africa paints a grim picture of global trade and finances. 

The country currencies at the periphery of the dollar global financial system are in retreat.   Capital is fleeing to the center (USD) at all levels of society causing the [Dollar’s relative value to increase](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy).  Many small countries are effectively dollarizing.  Either explicitly like El Salvador or in black market trading such as in VZ and AR.  

In dollar terms commodities and goods that have been over produced will deflate as the world economy slows due to stagflation and malinvestment.  This process, along with government policies restricting production, will ensure that sufficient investments in new production will not be made.  Meanwhile, costs of goods such as food and other essentials will rise due to shortages in production resulting from global government  actions including: pandemic response, sanctions, regulation and etc. 

Rising debt payments due to rising interest rates and reduced export production of slowing economies is triggering the sale of assets to make loan payments and preserve capital.  It is a cause of short to medium term deflation in financial assets and assets sensitive to rising rates.  Trade imbalances, rising US interest rates, debt, inflation and slowing production will collide with 13 trillion (BIS) of foreign debt, trillions in derivatives and foreign held US bonds, stocks and real estate. 

The US dollar is the world reserve currency.  The US central bank (CB), soon faced by a myriad of crises including high unemployment, shrinking GDP, rising energy costs and global food insecurity will abandon its tightening under government pressure.  Interest rates will again be forced lower by CB intervention.  US government spending and CB easing (at 8% inflation the purchasing power is halved every 9 years) will steadily erode the dollar into the next decade.  The value of the dollar for international trade has become uncertain.

As a result, economic conflicts between nations are on the rise.  Sanctions impede the flow of capital between trading partners.  Regulation by governments further restrict international exchange.   The demand by many individuals, groups and governments for an alternative for trade has become a powerful driver for change.

As confidence in the global reserve currency is eroded and the demand for a alternative becomes essential, the transition to Bitcoin as a technology for exchange [will commence](https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-officials-approve-use-of-crypto-for-cross-border-payments-report) between trading partners that are in search of an apolitical, fair and secure settlement alternative.  Bitcoin brings utility with regard to international exchange including speed, final settlement of transactions, apolitical decentralization, no third party risk, nation state level security model and a fixed monetary policy.   These factors make Bitcoin an obvious choice for government investment as the equal opportunity and inclusive international settlement technology.

Advances in Bitcoin engineering and Taproot development are making DeFi at scale using Bitcoin rails possible.  Energy and commodities trading that leverage Bitcoin based DeFi contracts will emerge.  Gold will play its role as a store of value and enhance Bitcoin utility as the record keeper in a secure and trusted trade settlement layer.   Use of Bitcoin’s DeFi network as a trading layer will gradually transform the monetary energy of the underlying commodities, currencies and other assets within the Bitcoin trading ecosystem.   Once trade volumes and the types of trade between trading partners can be transparently recorded and known then the relative trade weighting of local currency value can be calculated.   The design of Bitcoin is fair and transparent.  All participants benefit in proportion.  No single participant, government or group has more control than another.

The transition will be complete.   Bitcoin and its financial layers will have subsumed the international trade system.  A new age of fair trade between politically and economically diverse forms of government and people can begin.",cryptocurrency,1663869529

personalfinance,Want to buy a house but struggling to save,"Hey everyone. I feel like my wife (26f) and I (27m) are just treading water and will never be able to afford a house. We live in a HCOL area. I just started a new job a few months ago making 85k salary and a 15-20% annual bonus that is dependent upon company performance. My wife works part time at $30 an hour and made about $18k last year but should make closer to $23k this year. 

Our combined average take home pay is about $5,700 (my health insurance is pretty expensive at $600 a paycheck but I knew that going into the job). My net pay is $4,100 and my wife usually makes 800-900 per pay period, so conservatively putting this at 1,600 a month. She only works 15-18 hours a week. 

I do not have a 401k with this job and neither does my wife. Currently have about $55k in a 401k from my previous job and $10k in a Roth IRA. Liquid savings is $5k. Both cars paid off. 

For debt, wife has $50k in private student loans and $20k federal. I have $12k federal, so loan forgiveness will help us. By the end of this month,  CC debt will  be $2k (carried a balance over into a new month for the first time ever, unfortunately, but was almost $6k earlier this month).

We have a toddler and a dog. 

For monthly expenses:
-Rent: $2,375
-Wife Student Loan payment: $334
-Electric Bill: ~$120 (average monthly)
-Internet: $75
-Healthcare Payments (ending Nov): $150
-Childcare: $600 (150 a week to grandparents)
-Car Insurance: $216 (total for 2 cars)
-Phone: $85 (total for 2 lines + the device installments)
-Rent Insurance: $38

After everything, we have about $1,700 leftover to pay for everything else. We’ve tried to budget the following:

-Food: $700
-Household Goods (TP, Diapers, Detergent, etc) : $250
-Transportation: $200
-Dog: $100

I feel like I don’t have anything left to save for retirement or a house. We used to spend $1k on food a month but have been able to cut back to around 850 last month and working on improving. We used to do takeout once a week but are now limiting to twice a month. We cook most of our meals and often do bulk cooking and freeze leftovers. 

Other things always seem to come up and we always spend the $400ish leftover on other things (dentist, kid runs out of clothes, holiday gifts,birthdays, vacation once a year, vet bill). 

I’ve tried asking my wife to work more hours but she’s hesitating. She cooks 4-5 nights a week and I do 2-3, but I do most of the laundry, and I clean after almost every dinner. She’s tired and been through a lot of personal issues over the last year so I don’t want to push her too hard to work more hours. Is this the only solution though? I don’t feel like we spend lavishly and most of the time we forego luxuries. I love my wife and she does her share around the house and with our child, but I really want to increase our income so we can actively save each month for a house and for retirement.",finance,1663875479

We know in the future we will want to refinance when it makes sense. 

Our household gross income is ~$195k per year. With bonuses, about an additional $40k (which will go directly to our 401k. We do not want our income from salaries going into our 401k for the sake of budgeting easily at $195k/year). 

We have zero debt. Paid off all student loans (on our own) and own both cars (still have my well working car since high school 12 years ago). We pay off our credit cards balance each month. When it comes to other monthly expenses our average weekly grocery bills, gas, cell phone, utilities, Netflix, gym memberships, nespresso pods, car insurance combined is about $1500/month. 

Our gross monthly income is $11,500 - thanks to being to a non income tax state. 

$11,500 - $3300 -$1500 leaves us with roughly $6k a month after expenses. 

(Haven’t included monthly electricity or water bills… estimating that to be $300/month).

It got sold to collections at some point (I believe it got traded around by collection agencies but I don’t know anything about that other than the old debt collection agency stopped calling me) and I do have the contact info for the current holders.

I went on deployment and my wages were garnished heavily (I believe that was for federal student loan debt)

Now I’m trying to get a job as a Mortgage Broker which is a great opportunity for me considering I work at a supermarket right now. Everything is going well in the hiring process and I already did two interviews with a third next week where we are supposed to talk about compensation and meet some of the team. They are hiring me in lieu of a degree because of my time in the military so it is a once in a life time opportunity to move up in the social strata that I cannot miss.

Because I am dumb I didn’t even think about the bank being worried about my debt when they did a credit check. They want me to provide a Letter of Explanation. I don’t know what I can say in that letter that would convince them to still hire me.

The irony is based on the salary and commission we discussed during our last interview I’d be able to pay off the debt in no time. 

I’m wondering what my options are here. Looking for advice on settling the debt with a lump sum, what to put in the Letter of Explanation, and really anything that can help.

The statue of limitations where the agency is located is 6 years. From what I’ve read, the closer it is to that limit the easier it is to negotiate a lump sum payment. I can’t in good faith negotiate a payment plan with my current job as my income is very low.

My fiancé had a good job and makes decent money and could help with a lump sum, but I don’t want to do that to her and I don’t know if that would help my current situation with my prospective employer anyway.

Please, any help is greatly appreciated.",finance,1663877000

stocks,My educated inexperienced analysis. Been at this just over 3 months.,"The market began in a descending wedge when Powell spoke about aggressively combating inflation. Since then any rally has been on false hopes of a soft landing that would be crushed by data supporting the likelihood of us entering a recession. Some traders attempted to make sense of the rallies by saying the Feds are either bluffing, not in a position to do it and then up till this week, the last hope of a .5 interest rate hike. That is if you believed they were bluffing, or that they didn’t have the tools to combat inflation, i.e strong employment, the highest competitive wage market in my young life, and the trillions injected into the economy. 

If you look at SPY (which mirrors or inverses all the huge stocks), you’ll see that the market was respecting the 30min 50MA since before Powell spoke. Ever since then it only began respecting the 30min 50MA when it would rally for a false breakout. If you look at the last rally before we confirmed with more data that we will be seeing a .75 rate hike, we dropped back under that 30min 50MA in a single day, not only did we drop under the 30min 50MA but we also broke back into the wedge we were out of for the largest decline the market has seen in a single day since the pandemic in 2020. In addition to this, every single one of those rallies were after dividends payouts. I theorize that the larger money are rolling their dividends payouts into shares at a discounted rate due to tax laws. They are then buying both low and selling high in the form of puts. Each rally is just an opportunity for shares to be dumped on unsuspected traders. “Smart” money bought 3x the number of puts compared to before the 08 crash at the top of the last rally of hope for a .5 hike followed by a .25 finishing the hikes and decreasing interest rates next year. Since then we have now seen data that absolutely confirms we will be seeing a recession, on a global level. Now that the rest of the market is on the same page, we only have one place to go and that’s down. The Feds not only gave us a .75 basis rate increase but forward projection indicated another .75 followed by a .5 with more to come into 2023. Expectations for 2% are 2025.

Also, why is September and October historically bad months? 

Monday October 28th 1929, Monday October 19th 1987, Friday October 24th 2008, get ready to add October 2022 to that list....potentially of course….

P.S. a large number of those puts expire Oct 21st, 1 week after dividends, coincidence? One last rally into more puts before the crash is confirmed? I will say, this theory is a bit difficult for me to see because i don’t know how anyone could still be bullish enough to tale this up, oh yea, the algos. Personally, any rally at this point seems like a nice opportunity for an EZ ride down on puts.",finance,1663892414

CryptoCurrency,Are Markets Really Down or Up Since the Fed Interest Raise?,"Yesterday was absolute chaos in the market. Just after the Fed FOMC Announcements there were big price spikes going both ways. We can take BTC for a proxy of the market. There was an initial sharp spike upward, followed by an barrel roll right down below where the price was before the announcement and then a slow steady recovery. And even then, there were many mini-pumps and dumps along the way. All this activity has [liquidated 330 million from the markets](https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/fed-interest-rates-hike-spur-crypto-market-liquidations-of-more-than-330-million/). I'll tell you my take on this.

Trades seem to have expected a 1% rate hike as a strong sign from the Federal Reserve that they are willing to crash the economy and markets as the only way they have to really kill inflation. After all, the Fed only has control over money. They can't make companies produce more oil, food or houses, so instead they can raise interest rates to kill the entire economy as a weak economy also has weak and low prices and thus weak or low inflation. However,  the Fed still went along with the .75% raise, even tho the effect on this  has been very minimal so far, and thus also probably won't have must of an effect. History would tell us, as under the leadership of Paul Volker as Fed chair with the 1980's 15% inflation, that the interest rates must be brought close to, if not higher than the inflation rate to really kill inflation. With inflation at 15% Volker was forced to bring rates to 20% to really bring it down. 

I would say then that traders interpret a .75% raise as the Fed willing to let inflation run high in favour of keep stocks and asset markets reasonably performing as much as that can be said in these markets. Again, in the late 1970's-1980's the Fed also tried a method very similar to what we see now, with small interest rate hikes that keep overall interest rates are much lower than inflation. And again, in the 1980's like we see now, there was very little effect on bringing inflation down. I must say in my opinion that that the inflation reading that we got above 9% in June should not be credit to the Fed bringing inflation back to 8% later on, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation report specifically pointed out the energy spike (due to speculation that Russia would cut off oil) was a major factor of the large increase in that specific reading. And indeed the energy price did correct itself soon afterward as speculation died away.

So why are markets so volatile. Basically one group of traders sees high inflation as a factor that will crush the economy and that the Fed aren't fully committed to fighting it so they are short. Another group sees the .75% raise(as opposed to a 1% or more raise) as a bullish sign that the Fed is not willing to absolutely kill inflation since absolutely crushing the markets and economy and they are going long.  The thing is, both groups are probably right, and both views actually agree and feed with each other. But that just means the market volatility and chaos will continue. At this point it's more of a personal question of if inflation or recession is more significant to each trader; of which comes first: inflation falling or the economy breaking.",cryptocurrency,1663894563

CryptoCurrency,random thoughts on Tether and their potential collapse,"aside from the well known red flags such as executives being career crimnials, shady commercial paper backings, outright refusal to disclose such backings, too good to be true interest rates, and just outright shady history and association with criminal organizations, I have other questions about tether, like why they weren't exposed in the 2018 panic, and what the market would look like if they were to collapse. Maybe someone who knows about them more deeply than me can chime in.

As far as I'm concerned, the government can tell them to reveal their backings, but people have been doing that for years. I think the only way they get exposed is if enough people panic out of USDT into USD, at which point they won't have enough in reserve to service payments. This was how Bernie Madoff was exposed. I wasn't around in 2017 but I imagine tether didn't have a terrible reputation back then (at least not publically), and people were more comfortable keeping their money in USDT, thinking the $1 peg was robust. That might not be the case anymore.

another thing about tether is their ubiquity in shady off shore exchanges which offer insane leverage of up to 100:1. this is a classic way for greedy retail traders to blow up, such that even if these offshore exchanges are given imaginary money, the traders most likely lost it gambling on volatile shitcoins that there's nothing to return to the investors. It's kind of how modern day prop shops work, and in a way provides a revenue stream to boose tether's USD reserve.

Lastly, I'm trying to wrap my mind around what tether collapse might look like in the crypto markets. entire exchanges would fail. people everywhere would lose a shit ton of money. liquidity dries up and create wild swings. that'd be a hell of a buy opportunity for the survivors. but how low can it go? as cruel as it would be, I hope it happens. It'll be a big step towards crypto legitimacy and regulation.",cryptocurrency,1663899573

I feel the Middle Eastern governments there spends less time developing and debating policy framework and more time on how to benefit from crypto. In US, first President's office proposes a framework for crypto, then a committee will be set up, then it will conduct 2500 interviews - 2000 private and 500 public, then it will write a proposal on next steps. That will then suggest congress to create a legislation but by then, SEC and FED would have come raising flags that there should be regulations. Then all of them will draft something that will be presented to House and there will be fierce debate. If that legislation gets to see the light of the day, it will go to Senate where it will debated again against other priority issues such as Abortion, Wall for Mexico, Sending immigrants in the bus to President's home and so on. If the sun shines on the crypto community, some favorable legislation will get past, then president will sign and host a party in the white house. Oh, we are in the year 2035.

After saving the money to get the car fixed it took me roughly 2 months being the repair costed me $3,400. Also, I want not in an accident the wheel literally bent in due to the control arm snapping I had a spin out on the highway with my three year old in the car .

Now , this is my question I’ve now found out after applying to refinance the car the car is s serious low equity loan. The car is worth 12k and I owe 20k with like a 19% interest rate I have gap and warranty as well . 

I have an amazing friend with great credit willing to refinance the loan for me 760 credit score and no auto loan currently in his name he’s s good candidate. but I’m really worried about finding a bank willing to refinance a negative equity loan. 

Has this happened to anyone. Or does anyone know of any banks and credit unions that are more lenient in these situations? I just need some advice on my best chance of getting my repossessed car back . After 5 days the tow lot charges $25 a day and I have until the 29th to get something done or the car will be sent to the auction . I’m a single mom , just started working again and I can’t lose my vehicle it’s our only means of transportation and with this repo on my record and 20k debt I don’t see how I can have transportation for me and my son anytime soon if this repo sticks . 

Please give me som advice I’m really stressing out . 

Also , I currently finance with Exeter finance .

Now , this is my question I’ve now found out after applying to refinance the car the car is s serious low equity loan. The car is worth 12k and I owe 20k with like a 19% interest rate I have gap and warranty as well . 

I have an amazing friend with great credit willing to refinance the loan for me 760 credit score and no auto loan currently in his name he’s s good candidate. but I’m really worried about finding a bank willing to refinance a negative equity loan. 

Has this happened to anyone. Or does anyone know of any banks and credit unions that are more lenient in these situations? I just need some advice on my best chance of getting my repossessed car back . After 5 days the tow lot charges $25 a day and I have until the 29th to get something done or the car will be sent to the auction . I’m a single mom , just started working again and I can’t lose my vehicle it’s our only means of transportation and with this repo on my record and 20k debt I don’t see how I can have transportation for me and my son anytime soon if this repo sticks . 

Please give me som advice I’m really stressing out . 

Also , I currently finance with Exeter finance . However the loan has been charged off.

CryptoCurrency,"CFTC drama: Agency has charged a DeFi project for offering Decentralized Perps/Futures, says it is illegal to offer DeFi perps. They have charged all token holders. Meanwhile one of CFTC's own Commissioner has already dissented","CFTC just charged BXZ project for offering DeFi perps and futures market with a bunch of violations like offering unregistered commodities derivatives, bank secrecy act violations etc. As per the CFTC lawsuit, no one can offer futures markets without registering with the CFTC and doing KYC on all participants - which is an indirect way of saying DeFi futures/perps are not allowed. 

This puts not just the charged project but a lot of other projects like DYDX, GMX at risk. Furthermore, they are one step away from saying even spot markets are now allowed - if futures cannot be offered without registration and KYC of all traders, then how can spot be allowed to essentially do the same? Projects like Uniswap could be in trouble and can only allow KYCed entities to trade? 

Also, CFTC has charged all members of the DAO, and is seeking to enforce a prohibition on all of them trading for few years. This includes all token holders who have just voted. This is a wide overreach - not just the project developers but any token holder who has voted is liable, according to CFTC. 

[CFTC suing all members of DAO](https://preview.redd.it/jsv8moc1gkp91.jpg?width=1844&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fd35602e487f424d4018a5b891992d368b126da)

Basically, any member of the DAO could be prohibited from regular trading for several years, if the court allows this lawsuit. 

Whats interesting is that one of CFTCs own Commissioner Summer K Mersinger has already dissented from this enforcement action. He states ""I am disappointed that the Commission has decided to proceed in this manner since there is a better path available.""

In his dissent, he notes: 

&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot support the Commission’s approach to this particular matter.  While I do not condone individuals or entities blatantly violating the CEA or our rules, we cannot arbitrarily decide who is accountable for those violations based on an unsupported legal theory amounting to regulation by enforcement while federal and state policy is developing.  For these reasons, I am respectfully dissenting in this matter.

Yet I see very little people using this well known information (thanks FOMC) to their advantage and invest into TMV, which essentially shorts 20Y bonds. I'm a DCA fan myself for most part and mostly using TMV as a hedge/investment (50/50) but I also see lot of people switching to SQQQ (from TQQQ) while I see very little people switching from TMF to TMV.

Yes, the Fed rates are basically the overnight rates and don't directly affect longer maturity date rates, but with the Fed rates changing from 2.25% to 3% just the other day, and the Fed having the intention to go as high as 4.6% (with the current plan) for the end of 2023, I see TMF as throwing money to the firepit until we change to a more dovish scenario.

Yes, we've been having the yield curve well inverted for most of the year, and even so the 20Y bonds rate are just shy of 4%. **I just don't see all rates not increasingly proportionally** (ish) and hence TMV printing until the rates go down.

I will personally make the switch from TMV to TMF once the rates start going down but this just seems like as a safe bet as it can get.

CryptoCurrency,The Absolute Idiocy of the WH Crypto Report,"This was my third time going over the White House report and I must say governments just being government. The report reads like a kids picture book. It does start off with some fair points like the fact that algorithmic stablecoins are prone to instability in volatile markets, that some virtual assets can be very volatile and that the banking system does not adequately serve citizens, but the rest of it just makes makes no logical sense after stating these premises and turns into a steaming pile of garbage. I want to go through some direct quotes so that you're sure I'm not vomiting this crap up.

""Today, traditional finance leaves too many behind. Roughly 7 million  Americans have no bank account. Another 24 million rely on costly  nonbank services, like check cashing and money orders, for everyday  needs.""

Then later it goes.

""The digital economy should work for all Americans. That means developing financial services that are secure, reliable, affordable, and  accessible to all. To make payments more efficient, the Federal Reserve  has planned the 2023 launch of FedNow—an instantaneous, 24/7 interbank  clearing system...""

So what they say is that banks are inadequate and then immediately go on to brag about a plan for **an interbank clearing system.** This does NOTHING to help people left out of banking. It may speed up payments for **between** banks, but this is nothing to actually help more citizens get **access** to any bank in particular. They even admit in the quote that all FedNow does is make **existing** user transactions more efficient but this is useless in getting the unbanked people banked.

Again

""paying with traditional financial infrastructure can be costly and slow—particularly for cross-border payments.""

And later.

""Agencies will prioritize efforts to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments by working to align global payments practices, regulations, and supervision protocols while exploring new multilateral platforms ""

So they admit how poor fiat is for cross-border payments and only look to further complicated existing system and keeping digging to see if they hole gets shallower. XRP Anyone? It is indeed a heck of a day when, while they have their reasons, Russia is leading the world or at least the US in financial tech adoption and enhancement.

Another

""Stablecoins, in particular, could create disruptive runs if not paired with appropriate regulation.The potential for instability was illustrated in May 2022 by the crash of the so-called stablecoin TerraUSD...""

Of course they conveniently omit the fact that UST was an algorithmic stablecoin. I could be fair and admit that algo-stables have crashed a lot in the past. But it is hugely unfair to blanketly label them all. As a matter of fact, it is simply ludicrous to do so the dollar-collateralized stables  as they are one of the most safe assets in any market and any class. Whatever happens, investors would always be able to redeem a token for its full dollar value.

""U.S. agencies will leverage U.S. positions in international organizations **to message U.S. values** related to digital assets""

So instead of letting a product provide value to users and improve their lives, you want to water it down or kill it entirely just to maintain control and satisfy your ego. On top of that, the whole statement just sounds SUPER **c*****ommie*** to me. Not very free-market capitalist at all.

And finally.

""digital assets— some of which are pseudonymous and can be transferred  without a financial intermediary —have been exploited by bad actors...""

Now why the heck would you *want* an intermediary. They make it sound like a good thing. Like we should want a middleman taking a cut and making everything more expensive, cumbersome and miserable. And of course, we know who'd like to be that middleman, as they go on to talk about the benefits of the CBDC that

""could enable a payment system that is more efficient, provides a foundation for further technological  innovation, facilitates faster cross-border transactions, and is  environmentally sustainable""

All of which crypto can and already has done. So basically they just plan on doing over the achievements of crypto. Which just arguably with the exception of the last one depending on how and where you look.

I have about $200-300 to deposit in my brokerage account each month, which is currently going towards 1 share of VTI a month.

defi,The DeFi Franc Protocol (DCHF &amp; Moneta),"As a Stablecoin Lover and Liquity User, I am so excited for the next two days.

On Sunday the 25th of September, the DeFi Franc will launch. Today, the MON Bootstrapping will be open for two days. In this article i want to tell you everything you need to know about the DeFi Franc (DCHF) and what i like about it.

The Defi Franc is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against ETH and wBTC used as collateral. Loans are paid out in DCHF (a Swiss Franc pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.

The DeFi Franc protocol is a further developed version of the Liquity protocol (officially endorsed friendly fork) and their stablecoin LUSD. In comparison, the DCHF is pegged to the value of one Swiss Franc (CHF) instead of the USD, allows for more collateral types and is designed to support native leverage on crypto-assets and LP Tokens.

Following some highlights I am really excited about:

* **The Swiss Franc**  
In a world full of USD stables, sth different, The DCHF is pegged to the strongest currency in history: The Swiss Franc (CHF). This also is really interesting for me because the US Government has no influence on it.
* **Fungibility**  
We all know what happened with USDC and Tornado Cash. Because every DCHF is freshly minted, the token is a lot more fungible than many alternative.
* **0% Interest Rates**  
Borrowing the DeFi Franc only costs a one-time borrowing fee of 0,5%. It offers 0% interest for the entire lifespan of your position.
* **Multiple Collateral Types**  
You can deposit ETH or wBTC as collateral to borrow the DCHF.
* **Capital Efficiency**   
A Collateral Ratio of just 110% ensures that you get the most out of your capital.
* **Always Overcollateralized**   
There is always more ETH or wBTC deposited as collateral than DCHF in circulation.
* **Directly Redeemable**  
DCHF can be redeemed at face value for the underlying collateral.
* **Yield Generating Collateral**   
You can deposit LP Tokens such as USDT-USDC-DAI-LP as collateral. Because you pay 0% interest, and LP Tokens increase in value, in a way, you get paid for taking out a loan.
* **Leverage**   
You can increase your exposure to your favorite asset. ALSO to Yield Generating Assets such as the mentioned LP Tokens. If you 10x leverage a Stablecoin Pool that pays 10% yield, you would generate 100% annual yield.",cryptocurrency,1663941906

My thesis is that these ETFs offer a reliable dividend, and while their price growth would be nice, it isn’t critical. If anything, if their prices go down, and the yield stays close to the same, that might actually be good, since then I can buy more and increase the dividend. 

If a bond ETF like BND is offering 2.23% with a 0.03% expense ratio, or SPHY is offering 5.85% with a .
0.10% expense ratio, that's better than even most high yield savings accounts. So it sounds like parking my long term cash savings in a bond ETF makes sense.

Am I looking at this right?",finance,1663942614
personalfinance,Are there any advantages to consolidating my credit card debt?,"I have about 8k in credit card debt, and I recently got a higher paying job (\~93k up from about \~40k) and I'm ready to aggressively pay it off. Conservatively, if I stick to my budget, I could probably put 500-800/month toward the debt on top of the minimum payments which are about $266, paying it off within a year if my math is correct.

I recently looked into consolidating the debt via a loan from Upstart, but I'm not sure if it really makes sense since I'm looking to pay it off aggressively anyway. 

Here are the details:

* Chase Credit Card: 3.5k at 26.99%
* Capital One Credit Card: 3.3k at 24.49%
* Barclays Card: 1.1k at 29.24%

I was approved for a 2 year loan from Upstart for 8k at about 9%, with no fees if I pay it off early (I'm planning on paying it all within a year regardless of whether or not I consolidate).

My main question is if there would be any advantage to consolidating, besides the lower interest rate, which I'm not sure makes a huge difference considering how fast I want to pay it off. My credit score is around 650, and if there's a chance it would go up if I consolidated, I'd be more inclined to do so.

The only other advantage is that Upstart is currently running a deal for a $300 Amazon gift card if you take out a personal loan.

personalfinance,Am I crazy to spend all my emergency fund and savings to keep the house in a divorce?,"Hi folks,

The TLDR is in the title. I’m getting divorced and planning to keep the house. But to do so, I have to pay my ex. $55k by December 31. I currently have $53k after splitting our assets.

Why I’m anxious: if worst case happens and I get fired, I can’t find a new job quickly, and the housing market crashes, I’d be bankrupt and living with my parents again at age 35.

Why I think I should gamble on it: It is a way nicer home than I could afford after selling because of interest rates now, and I have a high chance of keeping the 2.5% interest rate because I have a good chance of being able to remove my ex from the existing mortgage. (Release of liability is an option from my lender if I qualify, which I should unless I get fired.)

House value: About $475k but the market seems to be cooling. 

Principal still owed on Mortgage: $357k

Monthly payment: $2150

Other debts: $165/month car payment, or $10,000. 

Gross Annual Salary: $89k (I have a decent chance to be making $105k in 2023 after qualifying for promotion)

401k: $54k (I should be able to take a loan on half of it in case of emergency)

People keep referring to the Fed pivot/put like in 2018, but the difference is, is that there wasn’t 8.5% inflation then. The Fed HAS to stop that or they are doomed. 

I have been putting cash aside for the dip, but curious to hear what people would recommend to buy and how to enter (dca or lump sum).

personalfinance,"Moving abroad temporarily, should we rent or sell the house?","We are moving overseas for 3-5 years next year and are going back and forth on whether to sell or rent our house. We bought in 2020 for $390k (loan was $370k) at 2.6%. We could sell for probably $525ish and net about $120k. The downside there is when we come back we won’t have a house and who knows where interest rates or prices will be. We are just outside of Salt Lake City, which has seen explosive housing prices (they’ve definitely cooled the last few months but not dipped) and is projected to have a shortage of housing for years. (People from here don’t leave and there is an influx of people moving into the state.) 

Alternatively we could rent and net about $400/month after property management fees assuming most utilities are covered by the renter. We’d have a little extra income and a place to come home to, but the issue there is we may not have jobs lined up when we get back and we know this isn’t our forever home. We wonder if it would be better to sell now rather than 3-5 years from now.

My job is in government and extremely stable. The only reason other people in positions similar to mine have been fired is for breaking the law or extreme ethical misconduct. My husband is currently a stay at home dad.

 My husband came to me with the proposal that we should take about half of our emergency fund and put it towards the balance on our car loan (2.29% interest). His argument is that because my job is so stable, we don’t need a large emergency fund and it is better to lower the amount we will pay in interest, and we will be that much closer to pay off the car, effectively raising our income. I am a saver by nature, and the thought of lowering our emergency fund like this makes me anxious. My husband argues that any large emergency expenses will likely be of the kind we could set up payment plans for, so I shouldn’t worry.

solar,Pink Energy: Mistakes I made and lies they told to me,"Hi there, new to this sub reddit.

Round abouts April 2022, i saw an ad for solar panels. I purchased my first home in December 2021 and solar had always been a dream of mine, so I was eager to get started. Within a day a salesman was at my house trying to sell me on it. And they did. They sold me 16 panels, an inverter, and i believe 2 batteries from Generac. 

If you're following the Pink Energy saga you kind of know where this is going. 

Now, for my part, a lot of this could have been avoided. I can hyperfixate on things and I prefer to get things done and off my plate. That eagerness to get started caused me to ignore red flags under the assumption that they wouldn't lie to me. A painful lesson, but hopefully one you are all acutely aware of. 

So it went like this. A guy shows up with an ipad, a presentation, and a pitch. Part of his pitch is showing me a map using software they developed showing a ""heatmap"" of my property. This wasn't *super* misleading, as it was obvious to me that they were more or less correct. The latitude was considered, the facing was considered, and trees were (sort of) considered. That technology gave me some ease, since how could they have so much money and be lying? (note to self: look it up, dipshit) 

He had mentioned their success in other states as well as Michigan (where I live). I figured with success like that, i couldn't be lied to very much. (again, look it up, dipshit). 


He told me Consumers bid for about 20% increase in costs for electricity and the state gave them 15%. Idk if that is true. However, with the assumption that it was, I was thinking now was a good time to get ahead of inflation. And really, I think that is still true. But that still caused me to be less cautious. 

Now here come the lies. 

He had told me maybe 90% of my bills could be covered. In hindsight, this COULD be true, but not with the package they sold me.  (more on that later)

He told me about the federal tax credit. It's about 26% and that return you get back from the government is part of how they sell you this financing. for the first 17 months, you pay X amount per month. After 17 months, if you have not paid the voluntary 26%, the rate goes up to about 1.5x. What they fail to explain, and what I failed to follow up on or think about, was that the federal tax credit isn't paid out as a lump sum (many guides on the internet fail to disclose this up front). It's a reduction on what you owe, so you will not get back that 26% UNLESS you had paid that amount of money in taxes. So, for example, if your solar costs $10,000, you get $2,600 reduced taxes owed. if you only paid $1000 (for whatever unknown reason) in taxes, you would only get back $1,000, and then the remaining $1,600 i believe is applied to future taxes. 

The way they sell this thing is manipulative and dishonest. As I'm sure you've read, they often say you can take that lump sum and have a nice vacation with it OR you can pay the loan and reduce that monthly, it's up to you! This lie has reasonable deniability because they can say ""Well, we assumed you would pay that much in taxes!"" or ""You should know how tax credits work!"" 

One red flag shouldve been where we agreed to put the panels. I wanted it in a corner of my yard between my barn and the property line. They told me it needed to be 20ft from any structure and 20ft from the property line. When they sent me the blueprints, I noticed that algebra is not their strong suit. It's about 60 feet from barn to property line. I checked this out with map tools. Their panels are listed as 26 feet wide. UH OH, you might say near instantly, as you can figure out that 60 minus 20 minus 20 is only 20 feet! That block don't fit. I told them this wouldnt work. They never replied, except to say ""Hey we still need this signed!"" Fine (mistake), i signed it figuring that it wouldnt work and they'd send me a new one eventually. Well, we did change it, once the crew arrived and actually took measurements. Surprise surprise, that dog wont hunt. This should've been a tremendous red flag, and maybe I couldve gotten out with a small penalty. Payment isnt due until the unit is installed. But, we chose a different spot and they continued with their portion of installation (trench digging and frame setup). 

Yes, they also mentioned the Lions stadium is ""powered by"" Generac equipment. I don't really care, but its consistent with reports about the dishonesty of this statement. And sure, it eased my fears. Surely the Lions wouldn't do something financially stupid (lol) 

Finally, the biggest red flag and probably the biggest lesson: He was eager to get my signature THAT DAY. I was eager to get started. He would say things like ""You have a week to cancel the contract if you want, so just sign now and if you change your mind, its okay"". This should be obvious to everyone, in hindsight, right? If anyone had told me someone was selling something that required decades of financing and they wanted a signature today, i'd have told them to let it pass. So why did I sign it? I'll be asking myself that for the rest of my life, I think. 


Now, for caveats and fairness and facts

1. The panels work, the install went fine, and the person assigned to my project was doing their job. They were coordinating the inspection, making sure Consumers would increase my voltage (they did), and giving me updates on where we were at.

2. The batteries they gave me wont power the house for a full night. They mislead me on this. Under full sun, the panels power my house and then some. Or, it would be extra if there was demand for it. Because we had been waiting for inspection and voltage, they had my inverter on a different setting. Now, its under Self Supply, and today being a sunny day, ive gotten 11 kWh so far (9am to 1:30 pm). My battery is fully charged again. However, I'm not yet feeding the grid. Pink was supposed to handle that. Cant fault them for closing I guess? Ill handle it myself. 

3. I could probably supply my house for the night if I had more batteries, i think. Easy fix, batteries arent that expensive. 

4. They did everything they said they would do, they just lied about the efficacy of it

5. One of the guys explaining the system to me was vaping in front of me during the explanation, which is something i read in an article about Pink Energy yesterday. I find that equal parts hilarious and disconcerting. 

6. In power outages, the breakers I designated are supplied and this has been a tremendous blessing more than once. It should be noted the fact that things work at all is only thanks to Generac being a company that functions, not Pink being a good company. 

7. The consequences of this are that my electricity bill is still near $200 and my loan is $220 an month. If I don't happen to have paid the 26% in taxes, it will go up to $320. I had reasoned with myself that my bills could possibly be $80 + $220. Still more expensive, but I'm beating inflation! Since I havent lived here in the summer, it's hard to say what my bill would have been. In august, my panels generated 370 kWh total, and my consumption was 992 kWh. With the battery setting not helping me, its only saving me like 30% of my bill. I'm hopeful that being on the setting I intended will increase that percentage to 50% or more. 


So please, let this be a lesson. Or a warning: Solar can be effective and it can help you get off the grid, even in a state like Michigan. But please please please, look out for red flags, do your due diligence on shopping around, research the company you are working with, and don't sign anything without thinking about it for at least a week. 

Hope my experience can be helpful to someone. I feel stupid and humiliated for trying to do a good thing. I was taken advantage of. Salesmen are evil one and all, and are trying to cheat you as much as possible, even outside the bounds of the law. Do not trust them at all, do your own research before moving forward.",energy,1663954432

personalfinance,Mortgage Forbearance Options after running out of savings,"I'll try to make this as concise as possible because I know I'm not first bring this up, but I do think this discussion is worth pushing forward.

&amp;#x200B;

I got sick and blew through most of my savings over the past couple years. I'm trying to preserve enough to make sure I can keep paying for my healthcare and not stress about work until I'm healthy, but also balance that with the long-term financial consequences of not paying my mortgage. ***(I've spent a decade's worth of my own savings trying to avoid this, please be kind and keep the convo to finance, I'm not trying to take advantage of anyone or anything.)***

I understand that my interest keeps accruing in forbearance. I understand that my principal is not going down. I understand that my taxes still need to be paid. I paid my own insurance already last month when the lender forgot to. *I* ***know I can pay everything back in a lump sum, make higher payments to make up the difference, or do a modification to add the payments on to the back end of my loan, but beyond that, the details and consequences of these options are fuzzy.***

I already did 30-year, 3% refi to cash out last year, so don't have much equity. I do have retirement accounts I could dip into if it makes more financial sense in the long-run, but since that also has penalties and because I'm so in the dark about how these forbearance exit options will impact my finances, I can't really look at the cost vs. benefit until I learn more, so I'm trying to do that now so I can at least be mentally prepared. 

I have a lot of days where my cognitive functions just isn't fully there, so I want to give myself plenty of time to learn, digest and decide what I'll need to do.

One post I read mentioned a second-position 0% interest balloon loan but that sounds too good to be true. Is there anything in the CARES Act that requires that? The educational video SLS has on their website doesn't mention anything like that. 

I have a hard time imagining I will be ready to make higher payments any time soon after depleting my savings like I have and the thought of doing a loan modification that may require a hard hit and a higher interest rate is equally terrifying, but would that justify taking money out of an IRA when the market is down? That's something I only trust math to tell me. 

I pride myself on making rational financial decisions and I hate the dearth of hard facts I've encountered from my lender thus far.

personalfinance,"mortgage assumption, refinance or???","Fresh throwaway and I don't frequent these subs so hopefully I'm in the right space. If not please direct me the right way. I'll try to be brief but give as much relevant info possible.

Ex and I bought a home in 2009. USDA loan, 100% financing. 160k at 5.5%

Ex and I split in late 2012. Part of agreement to split was I'd get her name off the loan. Took a ton of work to line up a refinance, because she purposely was doing everything she could to take more money from me. Finally get refi lined up but house appraised at the time for 140k. Principle was still over 155k. Due to her actions i couldnt afford a refi and she couldnt afford to sell. Ex was informed of this at the time and she agreed to not worry about it.

Fast forward to today, she has refused to discuss changes to custody and just assumed she could do whatever she wanted. So lawyers get brought in. She realizes her massive mistake (judge is super pro 50/50 and has already ruled in my favor and openly disregarded her complaints as nonsense) and decides to try and fuck me over and take my house. I'm guessing she was hoping to force it to sale and keep some of the money, since my horrible lawyer basically gave her all the power. Lesson here, don't trust your lawyer. 

Anyways, I have a very limited time frame to start the process to get her name off the house. Iv looked at loans for refinance. Zillow has my house at 213k with a range of 188k to 235k. 235k is a pipe dream.

 Refi interest rates from my current lender are 6.999% if I get 8k cash out. That's if everything lines up ok with the numbers I gave. Gave the estimated home value at 180k.

Girlfriend brought up mortgage assumption. I know essentially 0 about this. When l looked it up, USDA loans are assumable but I have no idea if it would keep current interest rate, or if it would go to current rates. Also since my loan was done a while ago, I don't have USDA's version of PMI which is .35% for the life of the loan. I dont know if this would be added if I were to assume the loan.

There was a flood of Financial Youtubers and Tik Toks on trading/investing, and there was a massive surge of naive retail investors/traders who thought it was a get rich quick scheme. Think of all the idiots who made piles of money on NFT's, Crapto, Meme stocks, Themes like innovation/biotech/Metaverse (ARK et al). This is all a result of the cost of capital (Interest rates) going to effectively 0 (actually negative on real terms).

It just made me think that this year, and probably for the next few years as we tackle this inflation issue (which won't go away as quickly as everyone hopes because of structural issues), the market will be a very difficult place as Bonds compete for cash. The history of the 1966-1982 period seems to be the most apt comparison. During that time, they managed to get rates above inflation when it was around 7-8%, and there was a recession. The Fed held the rates above inflation for about a year and a half even during the recession, and then started lowering them once inflation came down. Guess what? Inflation came back even stronger when rates started going down. It was only when Volcker came in with 20% interest rates and the oil crisis of 1973 and 1979 were dealt with that inflation was finally killed.

With all the retail noobs who got suckered in thinking they were geniuses, and the absolute excess of wealth that was created from asset price inflation (including assets that have no real value like NFT's), I think history will look back and call this period The Great Reckoning.",finance,1663967965

personalfinance,Should I buy a mobile home in cash or finance a house?,"So I'm 24 years old, currently making $150k/year. I'm debating either buying a mobile home in cash or financing a house in March/April/May of next year. I make $150k a year at my job and currently testing the waters on 2-3 side hustles, so when one works out my income could jump to $180-$250k/year relatively quickly. Then again, I could lose my job and my income could go to $0 quickly as well.

Here are my details:

\-Will be living with girlfriend. She'll help pay rent, but not much. Maybe $300-$500 a month. I've made it clear I don't need a lot of money in assistance, so we agreed that she can clean the house/cook/etc to make up for paying a lot less. We've never lived together (and I've never lived with a S/O) so this will be a learning experience.

\-2br/1ba Houses in my area look around $190k-$220k, with 5% down at 7% interest rate I'd be paying about $1,657 in mortgage payment/month.

\-Used mobile homes in my area are between $13k-$25k cash with $400-$550 lot rent.

\-I'll have $50k cash saved by March. I'll need about $10k-$15k in emergency funds, so I'll have about $35k-$40k to play around with for housing. Preferably I'd put 5% down if buying a house (already pre-qualified for a conventional loan).

\-I plan to stay in the area between 4-7 years.

\-I'm heavily focused on growing my side hustles/businesses so one room would be used as a home office (not sure if that matters)

\-We'd eventually want a dog (so mobile home may not be the best).

I'd prefer to live in a house, but not sure if it's a smart idea to jump in at these interest rates. I know I could get a job again relatively easy, but losing my job with a mortgage payment scares me a bit. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.",finance,1663968983

CryptoCurrency,Fiat Is Crashing and Dying Badly,"I honestly never thought it'd be so soon but fiat really looks like it's close to over. Below is a table of the major currencies around the world and their change relative to the USD from a year ago. It looks absolutely woeful.

[Currency Year-over-year Change](https://preview.redd.it/iuxbqnoodop91.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e84d70e8d51a0bcfebf6f8bf325ba778f318e009)

You can look at changes from a year ago, a month ago, a week ago or a day the the results look very similar. The depreciation of global currencies has occurred in virtually every single currency, not just those of developed economies. You can literally count on one hand the countries that did not fall against the dollar and there currencies have only outperformed the dollar very marginally. Now there is literally only **one** currency that has outperformed the USD to any meaningful amount. Only **one.** Anyone wants to take a wild guess?

&amp;#x200B;

[Russian Ruble Priced Against USD](https://preview.redd.it/tnp2qxk3fop91.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=735ea2a9ddb32494517488f79b6b6ea5aea21b38)

Of course, the reasons for this Ruble situation should be obvious. Russia doesn't really exist in the global economy anymore...among other very specific reasons.

Now we have essentially the currencies of every country on earth taking a plunge against the USD. And the USD *itself* is falling in value around 8%. This means that in reality, global currencies are losing **8% plus** the value in the table. Add in the fact that globally nations are **still** trying to fight inflation such that currencies are, at least for the moment, set to fall even *more* due to the continued effects of inflation.

It's no wonder governments are pushing these CBDC's although it doesn't make sense to do so. Even with a CBDC, everything is still denominated in the base fiat so all the debts, high interest rates, currency drops and inflation would still affect the CBDC in the same way. This is unless they plan to go really dystopian and freeze or severely limit everyone's CBDC currency to kill inflation. If no one can trade much goods, inflation immediate goes down as demand is suppressed.

I don't know how this will play out in terms of how soon fiats' end will come but these value show it is much closer than we thought. Countries embracing crypto have the right idea because CBDC's cannot save a fiat currency that riddled with debt. I would say governments want CBDC's so that they can easily disperse money to citizens like with stimulus checks to counter the higher cost of living but of course that will only make the problem worse by further increasing inflation. But we know the typical government attitude is to throw mountains of cash at a problem and hope it goes away.  I think we'll have to move to crypto eventually and take government along kicking and screaming. Crypto's time will come, but for now we still have fiat but fiat certainly looks like it's on its deathbed.",cryptocurrency,1663970747

stocks,Great Depression?,"Firs off, i would like the begin by saying that i have been doing this almost 4 months so any constructive criticism is appreciated, i see it as an opportunity to learn. With that being said, enjoy my book 🤣.

Personally, a recession has seemed unavoidable based on the Feds decisions and the economic data supporting those decisions. Now we are beginning to understand the magnitude of repercussions that will follow while the Feds attempt to tame inflation. 

During the Fed meeting today we heard from representatives for some of the different business sectors, wholesale, transportation, etc. As of todays meeting, we no longer have to speculate if we will see a recession. Businesses expressed hardships revolving around wages, supply/demand (be that too much or too little supply/demand), overhead costs, “significant” decline in profits, environmental concerns that have negatively affected different crops, and one i didn’t expect to hear, mismanagement of PPP funds. 

There was little spoken by the Feds though they did have some key comments and questions. First off Powell began by reiterating that they have been very transparent with their stance on inflation. In addition to that, at one point when the reps had neared the end of their comments and concerns, a Fed member asked one of them if they had anything that they could help them with, implying none of these problems being presented are their priority. I believe this is key because it says that everything they’re saying is stuff they already understand to be a consequence of the fight on inflation. It’s not the Feds fault a business grew too fast, it’s not their fault that a business has failing practices, it’s not their fault businesses mismanaged their PPP loans. At another point Powell had asked one of the reps if these additional expenses are going to be passed onto the consumer. When companies choose profit margins over stability for consumers, that’s an issue. Companies need to eat some of these expenses, some companies will have prepared better than others however that’s just how this works. As Powell said before “jobs will be lost, households will suffer”. The train is full speed and not set to stop in the near future. Add in foreign tensions on-top of this and we could be in for a very bumpy ride down, especially considering Putin doesn’t seem to be changing his mind anytime soon.

If you made it this far then thanks for taking the time to read this long ass book 😂, look forward to any comments and questions.",finance,1663973860
financialindependence,"How ""irrational"" are you when pay down a mortgage/debt compared to the expected 7% stock market gains?","In FI I feel like there are two principles that can conflict. One is to pay down debt as fast as possible and the other is that we can generally expect the stock market to produce 7% gains. If your interest rate is below 7%, the rational economist would say make the minimum payment on your debt and invest your other savings in the stock market. I think two things that would make me not do this are the inherent risk in stock market returns, which is a more rational calculation, and also the feeling of freedom from not being in debt to someone/thing, which is less ""rational"".

&amp;#x200B;

For me I think my buffer would be around 2% (So anything less than 5% debt I would pay the minimum on), but I'm curious to hear what other people's buffers are. Also I'm not asking specifically about current market timing. I know things are funky right now.

As the lockdowns ended, we were waiting for depression as our finances and wages took a hit. Then came Ukraine conflict. Other than Mr Macron, no one was interested in dialogue. Instead weapons flowed in and people flowed out of Ukraine. What was supposed to be a fortnight operation is still ongoing with no end in sight. Then came sanctions, freezing of funds, media boycott… Russia cut off supplies of fuel, gas, grains, fertilisers…

Result: 3 million plus refugees, massive damage to Ukraine, spiralling fuel costs, grain and fertiliser shortage not to speak of threat of famine in poorer countries.

stocks,Barrons: Could This Be Another ‘Lost Decade’ for the Stock Market?,"it’s impossible to overstate just how good stock market returns have been for investors over the last 40 years—and for even longer. From the S&amp;P 500’s SPX –1.72%  low of 102.20 in 1982 through its peak of 4818.62 in January 2022, the index returned 12.9% annually including reinvested dividends. That’s slightly above the average of 11.8% going back to 1928.

But the stock market goes through “lost decades,” periods where returns are hard to come by. The most recent occurred from the dot-com peak in 2000 through 2013, when the stock market finally broke out in a meaningful way. Before that, the stock market remained mired in a decade-plus trading range from 1968 through 1982, when the S&amp;P 500 returned just 4% annualized including reinvested dividends.

Albert Edwards has been singing the same tune for a long time about the end of what he calls the “Ice Age,” a period of “secular stagnation” that left yields low and boosted asset prices. But now, he looks like he may be right. Instead of printing money and cutting rates to boost the economy, central banks will now have to deal with governments that seem more willing to spend than ever, bringing “higher growth, higher inflation, and higher interest rates across the curve,

If Edwards is correct, it will come as a shock to investors who are used to stocks going up most of the time, and a Fed that always had the market’s back. It will also require more than a simple buy-the-S&amp;P-500-and-hold strategy. Stiefel strategist Barry Bannister has argued that investors will need to be more tactical, buying when the market is weak and selling when it is strong. Dividends, too, will be far more important. It’s one reason the S&amp;P 500 could lose 5.7% from its 1968 high through its 1982 low and investors could still emerge with a positive return, at least before adjusting for inflation.

personalfinance,A few SoFi bank tips from my first week,"Things I discovered this week using SoFi for the first time.  I went to them because of their 2% rate which puts them in the top banks for savings at the moment. 

So here's what I found:

1. You must set up a direct deposit of a paycheck to get their 2% savings rate, otherwise you get only 1% - quite a difference.  There's a lot more competitors in the 1% range.  This restriction is advertised in various foot notes of their website but you may not have spotted it when rate shopping and picking them.  If you don't have a pay check I think you're kind of screwed however if you do then note you don't have to deposit all your paycheck there.  I might only be $100 or less - not sure if there's a lower limit to how much you deposit for it to qualify, perhaps just $1 works?  
2. SoFi does have a user interface to initiate the direct deposit changes from their end - they work with a bunch of big employers and big payroll companies like ADP but it didn't work for me so I had to do it from my employer's side.
3. Setting up a direct deposit to a new bank account may take at least one if not two pay cycles while your employers payroll company like ADP etc. verifies the account info so you'll have to be patient before you get the higher rate.  Talk to your company's payroll people and see if they can expedite authorizing a new bank account otherwise they may actually cut you a check for that amount.
4. There's no fees at SoFi even if you have a zero balance but for adding other funds to your crispy new account you have the option of a free ACH transfer from an external bank, write yourself a check and deposit with mobile app, or pay your current bank a hefty wire transfer fee ($20-$40 is about standard).
5. If you link your external bank to SoFi (they use Plaid) you can use their transfer funds feature to initiate moving money into SoFi by ACH.  But note there are daily and monthly limits of $50K and $100K respectively.  Monthly limits will reset after 30 days - it's a rolling window I think.
6. To get around that you can set up SoFi in your external bank as a destination for ACH transfers.  That requires your external bank makes some micropayments into SoFi which you then enter the amounts of into your external bank to verify it was sent to the right place.  After that you can move money into SoFi via ACH initiated from your external banking app.  Limits on those xfers may also apply - it depends on your external bank.
7. ACH transfers SoFi initiate may be free but larger transfers can take several days, up to a week to fully clear and show as balance.  You'll get a small amount the first day, some more in another fee days, and the majority of the balance in about 5 work days.  For comparison imagine if you transfer $100K and already qualify for the 2% savings interest rate that's $2000 interest a year or about $38 a week.  If you can do a wire transfer from your other source for less than $40 it's going to be cheaper than waiting a work week for a ""free ACH"" because you recoup the fee by interest gained - assuming your wire arrives same or next day (which is typical within the US).  If you xfer less money or have $40 wire fees probably go with ACH.
8. SoFi help info says ACH transfers OUT of SoFi have similar limits so AFAIK if you want to ditch SoFi or need funds elsewhere in a hurry you'll have to do a wire transfer to move more than $50K at a time or more than $100K in a month (and again the multi-day wait for ACH may be a problem for you).   However you might want to check with SoFi before coughing up for a wire transfer if you're not in a hurry. 
9. The SoFi mobile app says you can deposit $25,000 per day using a check.  But their phone support will tell you it is only $2,000.  It is unclear if the latter limit means ""without a hold"" - they couldn't tell me.  All I got was it would take 2-3 days for check deposits to clear.  I actually think it is probably $2K per day without hold and some higher amount per week and per month, otherwise you have to wait for the hold.  That in my experience is pretty standard for checks and not much different from ACH.  
10. SoFi have chat and phone support which are obviously outsourced - or they have their own offshore team somewhere.  Some of the people you reach are clearly not well versed in details like things I mentioned above - I knew more than them from reading SoFi docs.  By phone some reps don't have great English or it can be hard to understand due to accent and less than crystal clear phone lines - you might try Spanish if you speak it or just stick to text chat, I think the same people do both.  I once reached one of their tech support people via an internal transfer and she was extremely useful to talk with, zero communications issues, but nonetheless sadly unable to resolve me issue which brings me to...
11. If you request a SoFi credit card and it is denied for any reason you'll have to wait 30 days before trying again.  No one at SoFi can seem to get around that - I believe it is either some State or Federal standard, or the result of the Bank of Missouri that actually issues their cards.  You'll also find that no one at SoFi can help you resolve issues with any denial of credit, you have to go to the credit company to do that and their standard answer is to talk to SoFi...
12. SoFi use Experian to verify some basic info when you open an account but it's not a hard pull on your credit.  You will have to unfreeze you account at Experian if it is currently frozen. 
13. For credit apps SoFi (or Bank of Missouri probably) may also use Equifax - that's what the tech support person told me.   In my case having credit access frozen at Equifax may have caused an ""Unable to verify identity"" error I got when asking for a credit card.   I say ""May have"" because SoFi couldn't actually tell me - the letter about it they sent (via email thank goodness) fingered Experian but there wasn't really anything wrong with my Experian info.  Unfortunately Experian also could not tell me why I got that unable to verify message either.   Since I'd just opened a SoFi account with an Experian credit soft pull you'd think there would be no problem with a credit check 30 minutes later. Go figure.
14. While the whole credit card thing did provide me with a reason to get up close and personal with my Experian and other credit data I've no idea if the application will work again in just under 30 days.  At that point I don't know who to escalate to but it's precisely the circle of blame that I hate to encounter.  By comparison my previous bank was able to add a credit card the same day in less than 60 seconds which makes me think this is an issuer fault and I'll have to get Bank of Missouri involved somehow. 
15. As best I can tell SoFi isn't an actual bank, just a collection of services provided by external partners.  They call ""The Bancorp Bank""  their partner but when you use the SoFi routing numbers that's what the bank name shows as.  But don't worry your accounts at SoFi do have FDIC insurance.

I hope these notes help someone - for sure they are the kind of problems many will never encounter, and they may also be problems you'll get with ANY online bank.  But right now if you're trying to park funds with SoFi as just a savings deposit place vs. your day to day bank then take note.",finance,1663976365

&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday to cap a brutal week for financial markets, as surging interest rates and foreign currency turmoil heightened fears of a global recession.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 486.27 points, or 1.62%, to 29,590.41. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.72% to 3,693.23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8% to 10,867.93.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched a new low for the year and closed below 30,000 for the first time since June 17. The 30-stock index ended the day 19.9% below an intraday record, flirting with bear market territory. At one point, the Dow was down more than 826 points.
*****
&gt; The major averages capped their fifth negative week in six, with the Dow giving up 4%. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq shed 4.65% and 5.07%, respectively. It marked the fourth negative session in a row for stocks, as the Fed on Wednesday enacted another super-sized rate hike of 75 basis points and indicated it would do another at its November meeting.
*****
&gt; “The market has been transitioning clearly and quickly from worries over inflation to concerns over the aggressive Federal Reserve campaign,” said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial. “You see bond yields rising to levels we haven’t seen in years — it’s changing the mindset to how does the Fed get to price stability without something breaking.”
*****
&gt; The British pound hit a fresh more than three-decade low against the U.S. dollar after a new U.K. economic plan that included a slew of tax cuts rattled markets that are fearing inflation above all right now. Major European markets lost 2% on the day.
*****
&gt; “This is a global macro mess that the market is trying to sort out,” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Bond yields soared this week following the Fed’s actions, with the 2-year and 10-year Treasury rates hitting highs not seen in over a decade.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs cut its year-end S&amp;P 500 target because of rising rates, predicting at least a 4% downside from here.
*****
&gt; Stocks positioned to suffer the most in a recession led the week’s losses with the S&amp;P 500′s consumer discretionary sector falling 7%. Energy slumped 9% as oil prices dropped. Growth stocks, including big technology names Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms fell on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Based on our client discussions, a majority of equity investors have adopted the view that a hard landing scenario is inevitable and their focus is on the timing, magnitude, and duration of a potential recession and investment strategies for that outlook,” wrote Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin in a note to clients as he cut his outlook.

&gt; The thesis is that folks sell positions on Rosh Hashanah the first of the Days of Awe to rid themselves of financial commitments and then return to the market after Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It is no coincidence that this coincides with the seasonal September/October weakness.

&gt; Interestingly the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period is not so bad in midterm years, likely due to the fact it lands at the end of the Weak Spot and the beginning of the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year cycle – the best buying opportunity of the 4-Year Cycle.

&gt; # Five Reasons Inflation Isn’t So Sticky

&gt; After the disappointing all around Consumer Price Index (CPI) report last week, the worries over inflation staying higher for longer (what they call sticky) is a very real worry. That report showed prices for many goods and services were increasing more than expected (even things like dental services were much higher than expected), while nearly every economist we saw on tv before the report was saying inflation had peaked and would be heading down, and in a hurry.

&gt; Full disclosure, I was in that camp as well, as I discussed with Yahoo! Finance here.

&gt; Well, it isn’t all bad news, as there are many signs inflation could still come back down quickly. For one thing gas prices continue to head lower, as my colleague Sonu Varghese recently wrote about. Sure, core consumer prices (excluding energy and food) are higher than anyone would like, but there are other types of inflation than just at the consumer level.

&gt; Here are five reasons that suggest inflation could still fall quite quickly and last month’s CPI data isn’t the beginning of a new trend.

&gt; First up, used car prices collapsed four percent last month according to the Manheim Used Car Value Index. This was the second largest monthly decline ever and the year-over-year change is down to 8.4%, the lowest since June 2020. This large drop wasn’t accounted for in the recent CPI report and will put downward pressure on prices over the coming months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-092122.png))**

&gt; Second, how much companies are paying for things is going down and quickly. Looking at the prices paid component of the ISM services and manufacturing surveys show a big move lower the past few months. Prices paid tends to lead overall CPI by several months, and so this is another reason to think inflation could come down quickly before year-end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-092122.png))**

&gt; Third, the ISM is a national survey, but regional surveys show similar results. The recent Philly Fed and Empire State surveys each show prices paid crashing lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-092122.png))**

&gt; Fourth, supply chain issues were a major reason for the huge spike in inflation. So, you would think once those supply chains begin to improve, so would inflation. The good news is we are seeing substantial improvements in supply chains. For instance, back in January more than 100 ships were caught in a logjam at the Port of Los Angeles, yet earlier this month there were less than 10 ships. And as the chart below shows, overall supply chain pressures have come down significantly. Another source of potential downward pressure on overall inflation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-092122.png))**

&gt; Lastly, prices at the producer level have come back much quicker than at the consumer level. The Producer Price Index (PPI) year-over-year peaked at 11.6% in March, but it was already down to 8.7% five months later. Compare that with the CPI peaking at just over 9.0% and only at 8.3% currently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-092122.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Inflation is still a major issue, and that recent CPI report wasn’t pretty in any way. But there is light at the end of the inflation tunnel, as other aspects of inflation is showing some incredible improvement and not many people are noticing.

&gt; # September to (Not) Remember

&gt; Hat tip George Noble @gnoble79 for this title from his superb Twitter Space today. He has been on point all year. Disappointing CPI and increasingly hawkish remarks and action from the Fed clearly brought the usual September peak early. But that does not mean we are out of the woods.

&gt; Late September is still a dangerous period for the market, especially month-end, and then there is Octoberphobia to contend with, which promises to be turbulent with all the market must digest. On top of the Fed, inflation, weaker fundamentals, fickle market internals, shaky technicals we have the negative seasonality from fund tax selling, end of Q3 window dressing and portfolio restructuring.

&gt; We have been cautious all year and mostly in cash, having honored our stops and indicators. June lows are only 1% away for the Dow, S&amp;P 3.4%, NASDAQ 5.4%, Russell 2000 6.8%. Cash is still king. Patience is in order. We are sticking to our Seasonal Trading Playbook. If you’re not nimble and able to trade quickly, wait for our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

&gt; # Worse Before It Gets Better

&gt; For those checking in on our Seasonality Tool in the past week, the current point of the year can either look like one of the worst, middling, or best times of the year depending on the time frame. As shown below, the median one-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the close on 9/20 over the last ten years has been a decline of 95 bps loss which ranks in just the fourth percentile of all days of the year. Extending out to look at the S&amp;P 500's median one-month performance, the 105 bps median gain is about smack dab in the middle of the range of historical one-month returns. Moving out to three months, the S&amp;P 500's median gain of 578 bps ranks in the top 5% of all days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-1.png))**

&gt; To look at seasonality in another way, the charts below show the average S&amp;P 500 5-day performance (including a smoothed look via a 7-day moving average) and the percentage of time the index has traded positively at each calendar day of the year going all the way back to 1945. The current week of the year has averaged some of the worst one-week returns for the S&amp;P 500 across all years of the post-WWII period while the index has tended to fall more often than not.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-5-Day.png))**

&gt; Again, contrary to short-term seasonal weakness, taking a similar look but using a 3-month performance window, we are entering one of the best times of the year. As shown below, the second half of September into October sees the average 3-month performance rocket higher and by early October has tended to be the strongest of any point of the year.

&gt; # The Biggest Pandemic Losers

&gt; With President Biden declaring that ""the pandemic is over"" on 60 Minutes last night, we thought we'd take a look at stock market performance since the pandemic began. At its peak on January 3rd, 2022, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 40% from its closing price on February 19th, 2020 -- the peak reading for the index prior to the COVID Crash. After entering bear market territory in 2022, the S&amp;P is currently only 14% above its pre-COVID high. In the Russell 1,000 -- another large-cap index -- 41% of stocks are now trading below their closing price on February 19th, 2020. 20% of stocks in the index are down more than 20%! Given that two and a half years have passed, we think it's safe to say that any stock down 20% from pre-COVID levels has been a ""pandemic loser."" At least at this point in time.

&gt; Below are stocks with market caps above $15 billion that are down at least 20% from their closing price on 2/19/20. Names like Boeing (BA), Delta (DAL), Uber (UBER), and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) were some of the initial ""lockdown losers"" that never really recovered, but other stocks that were initially viewed as ""lockdown winners"" are also on the list like Netflix (NFLX), Meta (META), Spotify (SPOT), and Zoom Video (ZM). Go figure.

&gt; Boeing (BA) and Intel (INTC) have been two of the biggest losers since pre-COVID with declines of more than 56%. Other ""blue chips"" that have been crushed since the pandemic hit include Biogen (BIIB), Citigroup (C), General Electric (GE), Verizon (VZ), 3M (MMM), Square (SQ), Disney (DIS), Adobe (ADBE), and salesforce (CRM). It's interesting that there's representation from nearly every sector of the economy on this list. The only sector that's NOT included is Energy, which is crazy since the sector was one of the hardest hit in the early days of COVID as the price of oil even went negative for a day.

&gt; Of course, COVID isn't the reason why all of these large-cap stocks are now down so much since the pandemic began, but the performance numbers are the performance numbers, and there's no getting around it. Management at big travel &amp; leisure companies have always wished COVID never happened, but more and more companies in sectors like Tech that thought the pandemic might be a game-changer for them in a positive way are now staring at big 2+ year declines thinking ""what the hell just happened.""

personalfinance,(US) What’s the deal with I Bonds? Should I be maxing out on them?,"I only learned about I bonds very recently. The current variable interest rate seems almost too good to be true. I noticed that the current fixed interest rate is 0.00% - is this common, or likely to change when the variable rate changes in November?

Also, any money I put in right now will get the current rate for six months, even though the rates are changing soon, correct? Given the high rate, does it make sense to put in whatever I can? I can spare to have some more money tied up- I have a decent emergency fund. I’d hoped to buy a house but now is clearly not the time.

Bonus question- does it make sense, given the market, to drop down my 401k contributions to the company match and pause other investments, and put the money into these bonds instead? (Until hitting the 10k threshold)

Thanks for any advice, I am new to a lot of this

Edit: my company matches my 401k contributions, dollar-for-dollar, up to 6% of my salary. I usually contribute around 10 or 11% of my salary. Because my 401k is tanking, I decreased contributions so that I am only putting in 6% of my salary (exactly enough for the full company match). I guess it is impossible to know when the economy will hit rock bottom. Should I still be contributing 10-11% of my salary, or is it safer to contribute 6% and keep the rest in cash until things crash a little more?

I appreciate everyone’s help. I am pretty clueless but trying to learn more.",finance,1663979398
personalfinance,Anyone take an equity loan and reinvest it?,"So let’s just say I can take $100k out on my home at 5% for a 20 year loan… couldn’t I just throw $20,000 (for my spouse and I) immediately into I bonds yielding 9.62% this year and $20000 into it January 1st (hoping that the rate is still high) and then put the rest into a HY savings account at 3.5% to cover all the interest I would be paying on the loan? This is an oversimplification for sure. But I figure first year interest would be $4800 and I could return $5700 by doing this (before taxes of course). Then by the time inflation finally comes under control, the fed will have raised rates enough that a basic CD ladder would actually make money.

personalfinance,Is now the best time to use my credit card rewards points in light of inflation?,"I have about $600 in credit card rewards. It's my vacation fund. I have been halfheartedly saving these with the goal of cashing them in when I hit $1000 and put it towards a getaway vacation eventually. Well, a good vacation opportunity just presented itself for January, and I'm wondering if it theoretically makes more sense to put this towards a vacation purchase now rather than sitting on them until I hit $1000. I will not spend enough money in my day-to-day life to generate another $400 in rewards by the time the January vacation would happen.  


This got me thinking. Assuming the following:  
\-Inflation stays relatively high for the next, say, six months (crudely, I understand that as the inflation rate being above interest rates)  
\- I don't have the time or inclination to find some way to turn these rewards into something more ""invest-y"" (maybe cashing them out via check and buy bonds/stocks etc), so the most ""productive"" thing I can do is use the $600 I have on a purchase before it loses more and more purchasing power due to inflation  
\- I really really want a vacation this winter  
\- I'm already committed to a long flight to Florida in January, and this is in the neighborhood of a few places I've wanted to visit   
\- I can comfortably afford to pay for this vacation without the rewards cash, and just keep saving up

personalfinance,Card Member Services balance transfer card 0% interest for life - scam?,"I have a Chase Sapphire card which a balance of $24,000 on it.  For the past several months I’ve been making large payments on this card trying to pay it off as quickly as possible. The current balances around $17,000.

Today I got a call from a company called cardmember services. They informed me that my information was flagged because I have been making large payments towards my credit card and they could help me by helping me transfer the remainder of my balance two another credit card with 0% interest rate for life.  The man I spoke to on the phone got me preapproved with a balance transfer to a Discover card with 0% interest rate for life and I received confirmation from Discover that I was approved for this card.  It would be however a $4900 one time interest fee on the Discover card when I do my balance transfer.

My interest rate was very high on my Chase Sapphire card and I was paying a lot every month so I figured this would be a good way to pay my credit card down interest free, and at my own time frame. I was making $3000-$4000 payments on this card every month,Which was hard for me to do, but I wanted to pay it off within the next 5 to 6 months.  If I was to transfer my balance to the Discover card I could pay off the card much more slowly but I wouldn’t have to pay so much in interest every month.

I was about to close the deal but I asked him for a couple of days to think about it first. I’m wondering what the best thing to do is. On the one hand it’s very difficult for me to make such large payments on this card every month but within the next six months I will be debt-free on the card.  If I transfer everything to Discover card I would still have a large balance plus another $4900 one time interest rate charge, and it would be easier for me month to month.

I used to bank with Schwab, so have their personal checking + some investment accounts there.

For a while, I moved to First Republic. I still have a checking account open there with no minimum necessary. I've kept it open because I plan on getting a mortgage in 2 years and wanted them as an option, but I'm not sure entirely how that works and I've been told perhaps having NO relationship might be better for me than having an existing one.

I have a checking account with Chase, which I use for ATM refunds and such (same benefit as Schwab...). I have investments with Chase as well as credit cards. Amex is my other CC provider I use.

I also have a checking account with Alliant, which I opened to get the 2.5% back on their Visa. I do like Alliant a lot and use this account mostly for day to day bills.

Finally, I have an account with Navy Federal Credit Union. I don't really use that account for much other than I applied for membership one day and want to maintain it. Same reason... I plan on getting a mortgage in 2 years and I hear having a relationship with them helps with rates.

My gut is to close most of these accounts and just do everything through Chase to keep it simple, since I already have to login with them to pay my CC bill.

Will closing First Republic, Alliant, NFCU, and Schwab really hurt my chances when I want to apply for a good mortgage rate 2 years from now?

personalfinance,Identity Theft? Getting Random Calls from Collection Agencies,"Hi everyone, long time lurker and first time poster here. Something strange happened this week, and I’m now worried about identity theft and my financial futures. 

This week, I received multiple calls from collection agencies named Midland Credit and Ability Recovery. I missed the calls from Ability Recovery, but I picked up one call from Midland Credit. The call was dead silent and dropped after 2 seconds. The missed calls did not leave any voicemail. 

I checked my credit reports (creditwise and fico), and I do not see any changes. I checked my emails and mail and I do not see any written communication from neither agencies. 

To my knowledge I do not own any debt. The only thing I could think of is that I had a medical procedure last year, and they are billing my insurance an insane amount and my insurance denied most of the claims. The medical bill I received stated “pending insurance $130k, patient due $0”. 

At the same time, I started getting calls from random people claiming I called them earlier. I did not make any calls myself and I suspect my number is being spoofed. 

Also at the same time, I started getting random text messages in Chinese. The text messages are random like “Did you go to work today?” “I’m enjoying a nice cup of afternoon tea, what are you doing?” I did not reply to any of these random texts and they never sent follow up texts. 

All these incidents happening at the same time is making me suspicious. Should I worry about identity theft? I read  in another post that I should send a debt validation request via mail within 30 days of receiving calls from collection agencies. Should I send the validation request if all I got was automated calls that dropped after picking up? Or should I wait until I receive any written communication via mail or email?

personalfinance,"Looking for a checking account, with very specific and detailed requirements","Hi everyone, and thank you in advance to any advice that you can give. My wife and I are starting to take security a little more seriously and, after a recent theft of her purse, we've decided that a debit card with a lock-function is a must for us. Our current checking account w/debit card doesn't allow for that. So, here's what we're looking for in a checking account:

* Free (or easily waived fees)
* Free ATM withdrawals (can be a combination of fee reimbursements and/or just a very large network)
* Free Cash Deposit (I don't need physical branches, so long as cash deposit is a thing via other means)
* Free checks (at least the first 50, as we only write 3-4 a year, don't mind paying after that if we stick around that long)
* Debit card lock function
* Reasonable ACH limits ($10k min)
* (Optional, but strongly desired) HYSA offered by the same institution (this can be substituted by offering HYSA-like interest in the checking account, for example, SoFi)
* (Optional, but a plus) Fast ACH and early direct deposit

We've been with Alliant for 4-5 years now as our primary checking and savings. We had the Alliant Visa Signature and, while we haven't closed it yet, we have stopped using it. It kept getting used by third parties, even when we'd just activate and sock-drawer it. Between that lax security, the lack of a lock function, and the recent purse theft my wife went through, I REALLY don't like the idea of someone gaining access to our primary banking accounts. It's a deal breaker and we've decided to move on from Alliant.

I've looked at some of the common choices. Ally, Amex, Discover, and SoFi lack cash deposits without some sort of fee. The one that I've seen that's the most appealing is Capital One 360 as it, at least in part, checks every block. No fees, large ATM network (though no reimbursed ATM fees if we have to go outside that network), free cash deposits at CVS (cashier) and Target (ATM) for my area, free first batch of checks, debit card lock, $25k daily ACH limit for same day (higher, variable limit for next-day), respectable HYSA (slightly better than Alliant on this recent upswing), reportedly fast ACH (same day and next day options), up to 2-day early direct deposit.

**How I'll use the account:**

* I've never traveled abroad. I aspire to do so, someday, but it's never going to be a common thing. Schwab gets recommend a lot due to this, but it won't suit my needs on this alone.
* Multiple direct deposits totaling a minimum of $10k/month (some of these will DD into the HYSA instead)
* Monthly mortgage auto withdrawal from (PenFed, ~$2k)
* Will be used to pay several credit cards monthly
* As noted, 3-4 checks per year
* ATM withdrawals about 3-4 times per year
* ATM cash deposits about 1-2 times per month
* Mobile check deposits every 2-3 weeks
* Won't be used as a hub account unless the HYSA is with a different bank (if this happens, then ACH speed and limits will be more important to me)",finance,1663997111

CryptoCurrency,How the hell is crypto still “up” this week relative to the general financial markets right now?,"Every since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again a few days ago markets everywhere have been getting pummeled… Stocks are getting devastated and a lot of them are under their 52 week lows again; commodities are getting decimated and the price of oil is crashing; the dollar is getting stronger than ever but other currencies are getting crushed; bond yields are soaring; the yield curve is inverting; and literally everywhere you look there’s a sea of deep red in all of the financial markets except crypto… Somehow crypto isn’t budging and we’ve even pumped a little these past few days.

personalfinance,What's the federal savings on an HDHP if you max out the family HSA?,"We were crunching the numbers and rather than put our newborn on my PPO (which for a single teacher is extremely cheap, but skyrockets with dependants) my wife and I decided to add him to her HDHP.

Forex,"I entered a short USDJPY position before market close, this is why... *NOT A TRADING SIGNAL, THOUGHTS ON FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS*","It seems stupid to trade against the dollar right now, huh? Well, I think there is potentially a good early shorting opportunity against the Yen. This is why... 

The fundamental view... 

1. The BOJ intervened in the Forex markets on Thursday 22nd September. This is just the start.   
I understand that the BOJ are doing this by themselves (without the support of the Fed or other economic powers) but they definitely have some Yen buying power - what a move they caused on Thursday! The BOJ could definitely cause at least one or two more moves like this, and I really wouldn't mind being on the right direction of those moves.   
I understand that the BOJ's buying power may not outweigh the current USD buying power, but this leads me to my second point... 
2. Dollar is king right now. No one would disagree with that. After this weeks moves though - and I guess the moves from the last couple of months - I think the dollar buying could finally lose some steam. I am not suggesting that the selling is over, but the bulk of selling may becoming to an end, which could mean the JPY could have the upper hand when it comes to buying power. The markets seem to have finally accepted the reality of recession and high inflation, which is currently being priced in - hopefully ""fully"" priced in within the coming days. Even if dollar pairs bounce for a few days, this could give the JPY the weight it needs to bring USDJPY down. 
3. For those willing to trade against the dollar right now, or trade against the dollar in coming days or weeks, which non-Dollar currency are people going to buy? The pound?! No. The Euro?! No. Maybe the Australian Dollar but the Yen - who's central bank is actively intervening to strengthen it - seems like the obvious choice to me. 

The technical view... 

1. **I am not sure what I can post here without making this a trading signal, so I need to be careful...** 
2. From what I can see, price is currently hitting key Fib levels based on Thursday's move and is also testing key moving averages on the 1 hour and 4 hour time-frames. Seems like a good entry to me. USDJPY is also historically far from it's weekly moving averages, suggesting that some sort of downside may be due. 

Obviously, price could continue to move higher. If it does, I will look for technical reasons to sell based on my fundamental beliefs.",finance,1664030790

financialindependence,2 yr Update: I left a FAANG pre-FI for a more fulfilling job and took more than a 50% pay cut,"TL/DR: I like my job, but also mental health is really important.

Edit: in case this confuses anyone else, the timestamp on my old post is showing up as 1yr ago on some devices. I believe this is because it was technically poster 1yr 11mo ago and some versions of Reddit app round down to the nearest full year. But it was indeed written in October 2020, and this is a (nearly) 2 year update.

In October 2020, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jhe6va/i_left_a_faang_prefi_for_a_more_fulfilling_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) here that was fairly well received. I wrote that post 9 months after leaving a FAANG and, as the title says, I took more than a 50% pay cut, pre-FI, for a more fulfilling job. I’ve been thinking about doing an update post for the past year or so, and now the time feels right enough. Quick financial recap: Back then I was 25 years old, NW of around 200k-ish, and I felt I was just about coastFI. Now I am 27 years old, unsure of exact NW, especially now that I have to consider house equity, mortgage debt, and recent market volatility, but it’s gone up a decent amount - maybe to 240-270k depending on how you count the home equity (and if you consider markets from a month ago and not time of posting lol). Basically I’ve been able to save some, but not as much as I’d like - who’da thunk it’s harder to save money on a lower salary.

# What’s happened since October 2020?

I’ll start with some life updates. Apologies in advance for being a wall of text / stream of consciousness. I’ll put reflections later - this paragraph is intended to just be an info dump of the last 2 years. When writing that last post, my partner (now ex) and I were weeks from closing on a house. The closing went well, and I love the house. It is an old house (1910’s), but so far have had no issues. Since closing, property values have gone way up - just got a HELOC based on a valuation about 30% higher than we bought. I should be able to remove PMI next month, at the 2 year mark. My sister, who lives down the street, had my first nibling a bit over a year ago, and being an uncle has been wonderful. I am still working at the same place, still remote. My responsibilities kept expanding until I finally felt justified in asking for a title change to CTO, which was approved without question; it’s not super meaningful at a small research nonprofit (&lt; 8 full time employees, but many part time and volunteers), but my previous title was pretty obscure so it’s great to have something clear and an obvious career progression for me. My salary has increased to about 103k - you may recall that my starting salary was 88k; not too shabby, but not tech sector executive level either! I now manage, at any given time, 3-6 part time engineers and student interns. I manage several projects, write statements of work for the consulting arm I started, manage some IT related stuff (I’m not the primary IT person at the org though), and individually contribute. As foreshadowed before, my partner and I have (recently) split up. I’ll get into that more later, but for now, I’ll just say we are on fairly good terms, and it didn’t financially wreck me.

# Brief review of October 2020 post

While rereading the old [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jhe6va/i_left_a_faang_prefi_for_a_more_fulfilling_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I’d say I was (perhaps cautiously) optimistic about the future and the choices I’d made then. My takeaways were that I liked my job more than my FAANG job, but it was still a job. Some gushy statements about values, purpose, and fulfillment, and having faith in the future.

# Do I still feel the same way?

In a lot of ways, yes. In the last year, I’ve actually come to enjoy my new job more. At the time of writing the old post, I was being pushed to work on this one project that I grew to really dislike. Once that was finally over, things got a lot better. I eventually started a consulting arm of our nonprofit, where we help apply our research methods to other academic projects as contractors. I’ve been managing engineers in a much more real capacity, and I’ve found it really fulfilling. I significantly helped in this one grant application, which, if we get, could mean a fairly significant expansion to the org. I am still regularly coding interesting things as well, and generally working easy hours.

The main thing that deviates from the points of my old post is that caring for my mental health was just as, if not more, important than having a job I found fulfilling (and, of course, the two are likely related in several ways). I’ve come to realize that I have had significant depression and anxiety, probably since I was a teenager. While I’d been to therapy a few times even before writing my last post, I never really got much out of it. It wasn’t until the Fall of 2021, when I finally talked to my doctor about it, was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, prescribed meds, and even took FMLA (medical leave), that things really started to improve for me. Just existing is not supposed to feel like a major struggle every single day! It’s such a simple statement but it’s really something that’s easy to forget when you’re depressed, especially when it’s been your “normal” for years or decades.

My meds (an SSRI and a mild stimulant) really helped me from being stuck in such a low place. My improved mental state, therapy, and some shocking life events (the sudden, unexpected passing of my grandmother, and a cancer event with my sister (she’s doing well now!)) really brought some perspective in my life, which eventually culminated with me realizing how unhappy I was in my relationship. Since this is not r/relationshipadvice, I won’t get too much into relationship details, but I’ll say that my relationship was keeping me from doing a lot of things I wanted to do, and kept me stuck in some poor habits (that really fed my anxiety and depression) that were formed when I was mentally ill teenager. I have no ill will toward my ex.

Since this is a financial subreddit, I’ll briefly go over the financial details of the breakup. We were not married, but we shared a house and vehicle. The house was technically in my name only, but we would have bought it together if it wasn’t for my ex being between jobs due to COVID at the time of applying for financing; we split costs and always treated it as co-owned. So, I’ve bought out their equity in the house and the car (subtracting some money that they owed me from something unrelated). All in all, it put me out &lt; 25k; it’s not really a life-changing amount, but it’s nontrivial.

Now that I have significantly better mental health, I am looking back at my career pivot with some more perspective. I still think it was a good choice, and probably the best for me at the time, given my poor mental state. However, I suspect I could have managed working my “unfulfilling” FAANG job if I had better mental health at the time. It was actually kind of an epiphany moment that led me to leave the job (in part from a self-help-ish book that I still very much appreciate), but given my extreme history with depression, what I think I needed more than anything was medication! Don’t get me wrong, I made great strides with self-reflection and learning to process my emotions. But, at least for me, my upbringing as an LGBTQ individual in a Catholic Texan family did not leave me well equipped to handle life without some significant intervention.

So, I am doing much better now, mentally, and am more optimistic than ever about the future. I am back into a good fitness routine. I am going past my comfort zone and making new friends - something I found extremely difficult to do before with my anxiety, depression, and being able to use my relationship as a crutch. I don’t regret my career choices, and I really enjoy my job now. I also feel that, if I wanted or needed to, I could probably go back to the tech sector and get a pretty good job, coming in as a CTO with the diversity of experience I now have. Or, perhaps I’d be able to freelance / househack my way into coasting. (Or, as a young new single, marry rich!)

A caveat to all this good, though, is that from a pure financial perspective, these QOL improvements might not be a good thing; my poor mental health in a lot of ways gave me tunnel vision for FI. Now, I am spending quite a bit more and saving less as I explore a lot of things I had not before. But, maybe that’s as it should be ?

# Conclusion?

I don’t know that I have a clear takeaway here, other than *really* investigate your mental health whenever you feel you really *need* a big life change. I’m not saying you shouldn’t trust your perceptions, knowledge, and beliefs, but if you’re fortunate enough to have decent food, a non-toxic home, and a non-toxic job that pays enough, yet still feel like it’s a struggle just to exist in the world, something isn’t right - and it might not be as straightforward a fix as a new job or new chore schedule.",finance,1664031330

I am deep in mortgage comparison shopping in the US Northeast, dreading the daily uptick in mortgage interest rates and hating myself for not being further along in the process a month ago.

One of the lenders I've spoken to is Embrace Home Loans, which has some [not great complaints with the Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/us/ri/middletown/profile/mortgage-banker/embrace-home-loans-inc-0021-105270/complaints), and has [high](https://www.zillow.com/lender-profile/EmbraceHomeLoan/) or [low](https://www.yelp.com/biz/embrace-home-loans-middletown-5) ratings depending on which site you visit.

The reason I am considering them at all is that their rates are way below what I've seen from other lenders through their ""Prime Plus"" program. Over the last day or so, the rates have been between 6.3 and 6.5% for most lenders I've spoken to, but Embrace is down closer to 5.6%. There has to be a catch, but I can't figure out what it is. When I asked the representative I've been in touch with, I got a complicated, vague answer about Embrace's relationship with Fannie and Freddie. They have an underwriting fee, but it's right around what I've heard from other lenders and does not seem out of line.

So my question is: does anyone have any idea how Embrace is keeping their rates so low? And tangentially, anyone have any experience with Embrace they want to share?

Edit 1: Adding some detail, I've been through the application process with Embrace and I'm being quoted an APR of \~5.7, with 0 points. Other than the underwriting fee, the closing costs are business as usual from what I've seen from other applications I've submitted.",finance,1664036802

MachineLearning,[D] How to generate structured parameters from a spectrogram?,"Say I have an algorithm that accepts as input structured parameters of the following format, generates an audio clip and then a 512x512 spectrogram out of it:

`[ param1 = numeric_value, param2 = numeric_value, ..., param100 = numeric_value ]`

How can I do the opposite? That is, provide a 512x512 spectrogram and get a set of random candidate parameter values that would yield a similar but random spectrogram if fed into the algorithm?

In terms of text-to-image models, I see this as the opposite problem. Instead of using a prompt to generate a random matching image, I would like to use an image to obtain a random matching ""prompt"" that's not natural language (i.e. structured and numeric).

Regarding the algorithm, we can assume that the amount of changes in a resulting spectrogram is proportional to the amount of changes in the parameter values. That is, close to no parameter changes will yield a very similar spectrogram than the previous, making training somewhat possible. The algorithm is also deterministic and will always produce the same output for a given input.

Is this possible? GANs seemed to be a nice architecture for this knowing that I can generate as many ""real"" training data as I want using the algorithm. The generator would generate a random list of structured parameters from a spectrogram, whereas the discriminator would check whether the parameter list is real or fake (i.e. coming from my training set or the generator). In practice though, I'm not sure how I would implement any of this knowing that GANs are usually not used that way (they usually produce images, not the other way around). There might also be a better architecture for this use case that I'm not aware of (e.g. latent space encoder). Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",technology,1664038149
CryptoCurrency,Ethereum remains troubled after the Merge. What is the way ahead?,"Ever since Ethereum's soft grade overhaul, named as the Merge, the second-largest crypto token has been struggling. The increase in rates by the US Fed has further added to its woes. The Merge, which was completed earlier this month on September 15, changed its mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), making it more energy efficient. It used the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism earlier.

Ethereum, which was expected to regain $2,000 levels post its software upgrades, was hovering around the $1,325 mark on Saturday. It recently tested $1,200 levels earlier this week.

The total market capitalization of Ethereum has dwindled sharply, and is marginally more than $160 billion, with volumes being flat at around $17.5 billion in the last 24 hours, the coinmarketcap data suggested 

What is hurting Ethereum?
Market experts believe that Ethereum has fallen prey to 'buy on rumours and sell on news' theory over the Merge, coupled with monetary tightening by the central bank. The vulnerability is high in the decentralized applications, they said.

Khaleelulla Baig - Founder - Koinbasket said Ethereum is losing steam as the US government's indication of treating it as a security instead of a commodity, thereby creating fear and uncertainty of tighter regulations and tax implications.

Trials and experiments carried out by mainstream web2 institutional investors to test waters in the crypto market are also causing some negative pressure on the overall crypto market spilling over to Ethereum, Baig added. The platform has become less decentralized after the switch to the PoS mechanism, said Ashwani Kumar, Founder &amp; CEO, HelperWorld. ""The Ethereum merge or upgrade could make it easier for hackers to exploit bugs in the code

The road ahead
The consensus of the market is weighted in favour of the Ethereum merger being successful, however, large-scale issues with the transition to proof of stake could be catastrophic for Ethereum's prices in the short term.

""Merge is one of the most highly-anticipated events in Ethereum’s history, and investors are paying close attention to the price of Ether,"" said Kumar. ""More adoption will lead to more transactions and hence higher yields.""",cryptocurrency,1664039971

For example 2 years back I knew that fed is decreasing the interest rate but I did not know the consequences of that over next few years.

I thought I will wait for a few months hoping bidding wars will cool off. Now the interest rate is almost tripled compared to last year. Even though the house prices dropped because of the increase in interest rate the monthly payment is around the same compared to early 2022.

personalfinance,Is 401k loan a way to add extra money to 401k plan?,"I was wondering if someone takes a loan on 401k (20k or 40k or whatever amount is allowed), at an interest rate of say 4.5% (or whatever). Then they pay themselves back the principal as well as the interest as soon as possible . So isn't that a backdoor for putting extra money in 401k, like going beyond the yearly limit of 401k? 

For example, if someone takes the loan and pays it back in a few months, then aren't they essentially depositing a little bit extra per month into the 401k account?

I understand that the money taken out will lose growth for the time period it was taken out. But is that the only catch?

personalfinance,Penny for your thought,"So...I have a situation since 2020 when my city and the surrounding towns got hit by a powerful earthquake. 

Basically back in December 2020 I took a loan out from the bank to buy an apartment in this city. 20 days later the building was roughed up by the quake as the wave went across our apartment building. The apartment is done, the building lost all its resistance and is still pending demolishment. Nobody lives there anymore since the end of 2020. 

Basically the government declared a disaster and said it will help in rebuilding all the damaged buildings/apartments. They asked EU for help and they sent the money. As per contract with the bank, I notified them of the building situation immediately and they offered me a loan moratorium for one year without the need to pay any of the bank claims for 2021 but they would increase the interest rate the year after and I would need to get more money to them in the end. 

Forward to 2022 Ukraine war started and the only bank at that time that would give me a bank loan was Sberbank (because I run a small SME thus everybody else thought of me as a liability). Sberbank got taken over by a national bank. 

Now I have to pay half the rate every month for the bank loan. Meanwhile, the rebuilding process is not going anywhere. The building is for now standing, threatening other buildings and people around her, government is doing nothing and the EU money that they got is either missing or stolen or they dont plan to rebuild anything. 

As you can see now I'm paying for the loan of the apartment which is heavily damaged and unlivable in a building that is pending collapse. 

I tried to talk to the bank to get out of the loan or settle on half the loan (I managed to gather half the money from savings and various donations) because I dont plan on paying for something I dont own and cant do anything with it like living inside the building. They said no, we want the complete amount. 

Last I heard about the rebuilding is that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild and if they do, they will basically build it like a blank, with no installations in the apartment, no floors only concrete (if I am lucky), no heating pipes, electrical cables etc. which the building had at the time of the quake. Bonus was that the bank loan was taken out in national currency which will be transferred to euro beggining of 2023. As you can see it's a very tough and strange situation and I am stuck. 

Care to offer any helpful advice or thought how I can get out of this situation?

  


P.S. I can't get any other bank loan because I'm an SME, and this was my one chance at getting an apartment for me and my family.

personalfinance,Washington State Resident Working Remotely from Michigan and Tax Implications,"So I'm a Washington state resident and a US citizen. I work in a line of work that is EXTREMELY easy to do remotely. My company wants to end remote work though and have everyone come back to the office a few days a week. This is garbage to me because most of my team anyways doesn't even live in my same state, they live in the state where my company is HQd. So I'll be coming into work to jump on zoom calls, lol. 

With that set up, I want to disregard that guidance. I think I've carved enough of a niche and because of my situation I think hardly anyone would even notice, save for maybe HR checking my badge scans? Idk that's stupid lol. But anyways, if I were to do this, obviously there could be company punishments, but I'm willing to gamble disciplinary action being taken, worst comes to worst I just come back and terminate a lease or something. The thing I am most concerned about are tax implications. Washington state has no state income tax so I have no idea how this stuff works. 

I've done a bit of digging through policies but idk maybe I'm just dumb or something, I don't really understand it. The one thing I don't really want to gamble too hard is financial trouble. So to my understanding, I will file federal taxes the same as I always do. The IRS doesn't care as long as they get their cut, is that right? So the problem would be specifically with Michigan state income taxes? How are those usually paid? All Michigan residents will receive one? Do I request one? I see two paths

1. I contact some Michigan government place to get some form to pay taxes to them. 
2. I keep my mouth shut. 

If I choose option (1), will that notify my employer? I assume I have to list them and my W2s, so would they then know I'm working from Michigan because for some income tax purposes Michigan will contact them to file whatever?

If I choose option (2) what could be the legal repurcussions? I'm not looking to commit tax evasion or anything. I heard that companies will have to pay taxes to states they're based in though? So if I were to go behind my company's back is there the possibility of the company fining me? Idk if it makes it better but I think my company DOES have an office in Detroit, but I would like to know in both cases. Not trying to get into legal trouble. Basically the most I want to risk is them firing me.

As if SEC was not enough!,"An independent agency of the Pentagon hired Inca Digital for the year-long project to assess the threat cryptocurrencies may present to the U.S.

The U.S. Department of Defense hired a crypto intelligence firm to review the potential security threat of cryptocurrencies.

DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, has tasked Inca Digital with developing tools to understand how crypto markets work and help crack down on the illicit uses of digital assets that could pose a risk to national security. DARPA is an independent agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon.

“The program underway here involves mapping out the cryptocurrency universe in some detail,” Mark Flood, a program manager with the agency, told The Washington Post.

Inca Digital, owned by veterans, and its government contracting entity, Inca Digital Federal, analyze data across crypto markets, blockchains, and news and social media to deliver intelligence to financial institutions, technology firms and government entities.

The firm announced a Series A fundraise led by Galaxy Digital and GTS Venture Capital in April. Other investors include Wedbush Capital and Menai Financial Group. 

Inca Digital counts a wide range of government and private sector companies among its clientele including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, crypto exchange FTX and brokerage firm Fidelity.

The news comes at a time when a number of government agencies take a closer look at the crypto market. The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) recently sanctioned Tornado Cash for helping a North Korean organization launder more than $455 million worth of stolen cryptocurrency.

TransUnion 616
Equifax 620
Experian 606

I had one collection on there from an old apartment, from last year, for $291. I paid that off this week. 

I have one credit line and it's been maxed at $3,000 for a while now. I paid $400 on that this week.

I have one credit card, with a $300 limit. It was actually over the limit for a few days last month at $345, which I made a $53 payment on a couple of weeks ago, but this week I paid it down to a $17 balance.

I have 8750 in student loans. Will most likely be cancelled.

I have another credit card on there, which I think is just an old card that I paid all the way down and did not close, because it reports a 6100 available credit, but I don't have the card for it anymore. I don't know if I should close it or figure out how to access that account and leave it open? In any case it's a zero balance. CITI card apparently.

I also have two derogatory marks on my credit,  both were around 5k. one shows current/settled, one shows as a charge off, unfortunately. The charge off *should* drop off at the end of next year, and I don't know what else I could do about it right now. The settled one should go a year or so later.

Last weekend my financially organized sister cosigned for me to take out a $11,500 loan for a car because my car bit the dust. As a 6.5% interest rate over 60 months, with affordable payments. I put $6,500 down on it.

All that being said, the only thing that has come through so far on my credit reports is the $53 payment on my credit card. As far as the Equifax report, it went up 33 pts (to 653) with that $53 payment being the only reported change. As far as the TransUnion report, today it went *down* 17 points, to 597) with that $53 payment still being the only reported change. Experian has no changes as of right now. Can anyone help me understand why that happened?

Also, any idea what I should expect to happen to my scores with the changes I've recently made? I'm hoping that it will increase them over time. at first, but I know that it might not, just wondering what to expect.

The **US is running low on gasoline on the West Coast and in the Midwest, where prices are surging on the street, defying falling futures markets.**

**Wholesale fuel prices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland have all reached record highs this week as a spate of unplanned refinery shutdowns compounded scheduled maintenance, at a time when seasonal stockpiles are already at their lowest level in 14 years.**

**A similar dynamic is playing out in the Midwest, where a deadly refinery fire sent Chicago wholesale gasoline surging, matching its most expensive level ever relative to futures**. Meanwhile, pump prices are rising again in many states, as is the national average, according to auto club AAA.

**Soaring fuel prices on the ground are in sharp contrast to what’s playing out in the futures markets for both oil and gasoline, where traders are focused on a worsening global economic outlook. The signs of a slowing economy -- from weak fuel demand to collapsing freight markets -- are hard to ignore, not to mention the spate of additional interest rate hikes this week designed to rein in inflation that will no doubt also stunt growth**. For the consumer already weighed down by historic costs, rising pump prices are another burden they must bear.

**Prices are likely to remain high without easy resupply options**. **California is geographically isolated from supply hubs in the country, and receives imports from places like Asia and Europe that often take weeks to arrive.** The Nord Harmony is due to offload fuel in Los Angeles in the next few days, but a dearth of fresh loadings mean imports will remain scarce, vessel tracking data show.

investing,Risk of Leveraged Companies with Rising Interest Rates,"I've just noticed how big risks leveraged companies have in the current macro condition. That is something I haven't seen nicely explained here. I'd like to pinpoint my observation here and I'd appreciate your feedback.

Last week I've seen the biggest Slovenian bank (that is the bank in the EU), NLB Banka, issuing EUR bonds with a hefty coupon of 9.721 %! The bank is not really in a troublesome condition according to financial data, even its valuation looks interesting. What is funny is that its biggest subsidiary offers 0.3% interest on EUR deposits, so being a retail saver in the bank sounds stupid. Then I figured out that these much higher coupon payments in the future will screw bank profit margins! The bank has Standard &amp; Poors's long-term rating BBB and Moody's Baa1. Luckily for investors in this bank, the next bonds to reprogram come in 2025 and these bonds that are just reprogrammed are less than 20% of the overall bank's bonds.

**What this means for other companies:**  yields are going really up fast, and it could really affect all leveraged companies. As REITs are typically highly leveraged,  I wanted to calculate what could happen to their profits. Let's take into example $AMT, American Tower, market cap 106B. It has 40.8B in debt and if interest rates stay high, once they'll have to issue new bonds with higher interest rates. Let's say that over time they reprogrammed all debt with 250bps (that is 2.5%) higher interest rate, that is 1.02B higher interest payment per year. That would be 1.02B less net income (last year net income was $2.57B, this is 40% lower projected net income). AFFO (Adjusted Funds for Operations) in 2021 was 4,373M, so over the long term, AFFO could go down 25% with 250bps higher interest rates) . And $AMT is in relatively good financial condition, it has 6.4x debt to EBITDA, and 60% debt to assets, once you make the same calculations into some highly leveraged mid-caps and small-caps, things start to look very ugly.

Bonds rates went really up and continue that trend and I think we should prepare for a really hard landing. That means I think that SP500 will go down at least 10% more, as the shit still didn't hit the fan.",finance,1664090680

CryptoCurrency,Big Regulation Positivity: Congress Ask For Report On Beneficial Use of Crypto In Ukraine,"There are media reports that Congress have passed a bill to pursue the benefits of crypto, specifically in the situation of Ukraine. So far, the bill has passed the House and currently sits in the Senate but it is expected to be passed. The bill will require the State Department to submit a report to Congress explaining how “cryptocurrencies or other technologies  incorporating blockchain” have been used to promote economic development and provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine. It will also ask for information on how effective sanctions  have been against Russia, and what method they may/are using to undermine it. Regardless the very fact that Congress is pursuing clearly any beneficial crypto usage at all is a big step up from the very hawkish, negative and [self-contradictory](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xluyl5/the_absolute_idiocy_of_the_wh_crypto_report/) Crypto Report released by the White House recently.

If passed, this would be a big win as the CFTC literally can't be any worse than the SEC. Additionally, the CFTC would be more likely to and incentivized to fairly help more tokens be declared as commodities rather than securities as the more commodities there are present the more power they yield and the more government funding they gain.

My friends, crypto is here to stay.

personalfinance,"Lost job, unable to get similar income for roughly 5 months","This post is a cry for help on any advice any of you smart money people have to help my family and I get by until I can go back to work.  I work in the medical profession, and am unable to obtain anywhere near my previous salary until roughly February of 2023 (This is not guaranteed, but only an estimate).  I do not have any other skills or trades.  We have an 18 month boy, and another one due in January 2023.  We are both 34 years of age.

Our joint net income has dropped from $8,200 a month to $1,300 a month (Wifes income as a teacher for a public school working part time)

Mortgage payment is $2,600 / month (Recently refinanced to obtain 2.25% APR with $306,000 in principle over 15 years).  House is worth roughly $590,000.  I am aware I most likely made a mistake refinancing to a 15 year mortgage, but at the time we had extra money and I wanted to take advantage of the low interest rate.  Refinancing now looks like it would be a terrible idea as interest rates have skyrocketed. 

Utilities average - $450 / month

Basic internet and phone service - $90 / month

We roughly spend about $600 a month on groceries.  This could obviously be lowered, but the nutrition to my child and pregnant wife are very important to us.  

I have $150,000 currently in my 401k.  This is my only investment account.  My wife has a VALIC account, but there is a negligible amount of money in it.  

We have only $5,200 in savings.

We do not have any outstanding loans, credit cards and vehicles are all paid off.  The only loan to both of our names is our mortgage with SoFi.  On Friday I requested a hardship packet be sent to me so I can go over forbearance options, etc.  A close friend of mine told me that might not be smart as my best option to get by in his opinion is to take a HELOC, and he was not sure how a forbearance would affect a HELOC.   

My credit score is 803 and my wife's is 790.  

We live in the United States in the state of Georgia.

Our main goal as a family is to not have to sell the house we are living in.  This house is perfect for our family, perfect neighborhood, etc.  If we lost this house I will most likely lose my family, as this whole situation is completely my fault; furthermore, I lost my job at a fault of my own, so I do not believe I would qualify for unemployment.  

We are currently looking around the house for things we can sell for extra cash, etc.  Currently in the process of selling a motorcycle, worth roughly $4,000.  The only other large asset is my wife's engagement ring, which was purchased for $15,000 in 2016.  She has already offered to do something with her ring, but I really do not want to go that route.  

Last thing I will add is there is a small possibility that I lose my career as a whole, unable to practice in my current field.  This would obviously change everything.  I will not find out about this until roughly January 2023.  If this happens, I know the obvious choice is the house has to go.  Not sure how things would work if I have an outstanding HELOC and decide we have to sell, etc.

I have a few friends and family that have cash and are willing to help, but would like to do everything in my power to handle things myself.  I was advised to reach out here, to see if there are government programs I could qualify for, other options I do not know about, etc.  Any help is appreciated.",finance,1664104674

I'm wondering if anyone has more information. Is this true? Does the a new roof qualify (a new roof is a prerequisite for adding a solar system in my case)? If it does qualify do I need to get it replaced by the solar installer or could I used a different installer for the roof? Anything else I should be considering when replacing my roof to add solar?

investing,Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This Year,"Share prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&amp;P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&amp;P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&amp;P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.” ***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***

&gt;&gt;Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&amp;P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

personalfinance,What's a good investment plan for 53 year old with Merrill Edge,"Long story short, my dad recently rolled over his 401k into a IRA at the end of March/beginning of April (pretty good timing given that was the last highest point the market has been at this year) and hasn't reinvested the money since.

He has $200k sitting and so I've been asking him if he's ok with me reinvesting his money, especially now that the market is down, and he seems to be ok with me doing it now for him as he doesn't really understand markets/investing.

He went with Merrill Edge since he banks with BofA and just wanted to keep it all in one place and also benefit from the Platinum Honors with them.

I'm planning on DCA'ing his money in case the market keeps going down, it doesn't freak him out too much. But I'm also not familiar with ETF's as I have my accounts through Schwab and am more familiar with their mutual funds.

Any suggestions as to what funds/ETFs I should invest his money in, especially given his age? I'm planning on following Bogle's 3 fund portfolio, but I'll be honest, I don't 100% understand the bond allocation part of it. But my basic understanding is that if interest rates are high (like they are now and possible to continue rising), then bonds will go down? I've looked up some bond ETF/funds and that does seem to be the case.

And I'm also wary of international stocks just because of their performance, but do also understand that past performance does not dictate future performance, so what I was thinking is just doing 100% into VTI/SCHB so he gets the full US market (large,mid,small caps).

gaming,Multiplayer in your 30s...,"**TLDR:** just me letting off some steam over the recent MW2 beta and how I just can't ""git gud"" anymore

Disclaimer, this may read like I'm freaking old, but right now I feel like that and I have to get this off my chest and maybe find some people that can relate somehow....

I have been playing games since I got my first console. Gaming is a big part of my life, I enjoyed alot of industry defining games, I experienced alot of major moments in gaming history I would say. But I'm not getting any younger and I feel like I just can't keep up any longer...

To clarify, since I've been playing games for so long, I first was exposed to alot of single player games of course, this was the major trend back then. There were some multiplayer games like fighting games or party games, but nothing major like COD, BF, etc

After playing single player games for years, I got my own laptop and started to play CS1.6 in class with my classmates over LAN. This was new and exciting, something I never experienced before, this started my journey into online multiplayer games, mainly shooters as you maybe already thought.

I started playing CSS in clan for a year or two, I played the first Modern Warfare, BF Bad Company 2, I played Halo on XBox and so much more. Through all those years I gained alot of FPS experience I would say, I spent the most of my time in CSGO and R6Siege in the end, I tried out Escape from Tarkov and played a bit of MW2019.

But soon I realized, I wasn't even having fun anymore, I was just going through the motions so to speak, a new fancy shooter came out, I liked the new weapons and animations, I played it and got fed up at some point, I haven't touched Tarkov since 2020, my last match in Siege was in 2021. I just can't keep up anymore.

nothing makes those games fun anymore. For me at least, the first few matches are ok, I have a decent score, have fun, but after a day or two, I slide into this unhealthy mindset, I want to play the game, to be good, but I just can't, there are people running and jumping through the maps, preaiming every possible angle somebody could come from, I just can't compete anymore and I just can't play the game just for the sake of it, if I play the game I want to have fun and this means I have to be good, because ending a match with 2 kills and 20 deaths just isn't fun in my view

I don't have the time to compete anymore, I have a full time job, to learn all the maps and know when somebody can appear where and preaim at the exact height of where their head can pop out, it would take the free time of a teenager, which I'm not anymore

yesterday I installed the MW2 beta, same as always, I watched the videos, I was excited to play the new game, today, just a bit before I started to write this post, I uninstalled it, it's just not fun anymore, getting clapped left and right, spawning, turning the corner dying again... over and over...

all this rambling aside, my biggest problem is, that I want to have fun in Shooter games, and most of the modern shooters are multiplayer now, but with my age and not enough freetime to ""git gud"", it just isn't fun to play anymore and this is frustrating, because I'm always on the search for that one game and in the end I get so enraged over myself not being able to perform, that I uninstall the next new game never to look at it again, biding my time until the next new release comes and start the circle all over again...

it is frustrating and I don't know how to get out of this circle...

in the case somebody read through all of that, before jumping into the comments and writing ""don't care"" ""didn't ask"" ""cry about it"" ""stay mad"" ""git gud"".... etcThanks for reading/appreciating, maybe you feel the same and see that you're not alone in this...

personalfinance,Is a personal loan the best option for paying down 30k of credit card debt?,"Hey all,

Over the past few years I've managed to amass around 30k in cc debt. (I only have one credit card.) I started a new job recently and want to pay it off as quickly as possible. The interest I'm paying each month is around $500 which is making it pretty difficult to pay down. After reading around it seems like the options would be a balance transfer card with 0% interest rate for some amount of time (how likely is it to get approved for 30k on one of these?), or a lower interest debt consolidation loan.  


Some other info that might be relevant.  


* Income is $112,500, take-home after taxes, 401k, healthcare etc. is $5300/mo
* FICO score is 721, on credit karma the other two are around 660
* Rent/utilities are around $1600/mo (I live in nyc)
* Student loan payments on my massive amount of student loan debt will probably resume at some point soon? Pre-pandemic they were around $700/mo. (I'm already on IBR.)
* No savings aside from a 401k with around 30 or 40k in it.  


On credit karma the lowest APR options for loans of 30k are happy monday (7.24% 36 mo), prosper (7.94% 36 mo), upstart (7.99% 36 or 60mo). I'd be paying around $1000 a month, which is about what I am paying now.

stocks,"Asian Financial Crisis II? Crisis Looms in Asia as Major Currencies Crack - ""Currency risk is a bigger threat for Asian nations than rates""","* **Heavyweights yen, yuan both tumble as Fed hikes boost dollar**
* **Rapid slide creates deadweight for other Asia currencies: BNY**

Asian markets risk a reprise of financial crisis-level stress as two of the region’s most important currencies crumble under the onslaught of relentless dollar strength.

**The yen and yuan are both tumbling** due to the growing disparity between an uber-hawkish Federal Reserve and dovish policy makers in Japan and China. While other Asian nations are digging deep into foreign-exchange reserves to mitigate the dollar’s damage, **the yen and yuan’s slump is making things worse for everyone, threatening the region’s mantle as a preferred destination for risk investors.**

**“The renminbi and yen are big anchors and their weakness risks destabilizing currencies to trade and investments in Asia,”** said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore, using another name for China’s currency. **“We’re already heading toward global financial crisis levels of stress in some aspects, then the next step would be the Asian financial crisis if losses deepen.”**

The gravitational pull of Japan and China are evident in the sheer influence of their economies and trade relationships. China has been the largest trading partner of Southeast Asian nations for 13 straight years, according to a Chinese government statement. Japan, the world’s third-biggest economy, is a major exporter of capital and credit.

**The tumble in the currencies of the region’s two largest economies may swell into a full-fledged crisis if it spooks overseas funds into pulling money out of Asia as a whole, leading to massive capital flight.** Alternatively, the declines may set off a vicious cycle of competitive devaluations and a slide in demand and consumer confidence.

# ‘Bigger Threat’

**“Currency risk is a bigger threat for Asian nations than interest rates,”** said Taimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Group Ltd. in Singapore. **“At the end of the day, all of Asia are exporters and we could see a reprise of 1997 or 1998 without the massive collateral damage.”**

Beijing and Tokyo’s heft is even more pronounced in financial markets. **The yuan makes up more than a quarter of the weighting of Asian currency indexes, according to analysis by BNY Mellon Investment Management. The yen is the third-most-traded global currency, so its weakness has had an outsized impact on its Asian counterparts.**

The rising potential for spillover between the two largest regional currencies and their smaller peers can be seen in the fact they are moving in ever closer alignment as the dollar surges. The 120-day correlation between the yen and the MSCI EM Currency Index jumped to more than 0.9 last week, the highest since 2015, after the two were briefly inversely correlated as recently as April.

The threat of a spillover has become even more severe as currency declines accelerate. The yen tumbled passed 145 per dollar for the first time in more than two decades Thursday after US-Japan monetary policy divergence widened further when the Fed raised interest rates for a fifth straight meeting the day before. The yen retraced some of its losses after the authorities intervened but few see the action as doing anything other than slowing its inevitable decline.

The yuan slid past its own key level of 7 per dollar earlier this month, under pressure from the hawkish Fed and slowing growth in China caused by Covid-Zero lockdowns and a property-market crisis. The onshore currency extended losses on Friday to a level closest to the weak end of its allowed trading band since a shock currency devaluation in 2015.

# Trigger Point

Specific levels such as the yen at 150 may bring on turmoil on the scale of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, according to market veteran Jim O’Neill, previously chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Others say the velocity of declines is more important than individual trigger points.

A rapid drop of the yen and yuan “can quickly become a ‘deadweight’ for other regional currencies,” said Aninda Mitra, head of Asia macro and investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management in Singapore. “Much further yuan depreciation could be more troubling from here for the rest of the region.”

Of course, there’s no certainty further losses in the yen and yuan will bring on a financial upheaval. Nations in the region are in a far stronger position than they were in the run-up to the Asian financial crisis on the late 1990s, having greater foreign-exchange reserves and less exposure to dollar borrowing. Still, there are pockets of risk.

**“The most vulnerable currencies are those with the deficit current-account positions such as the Korean won, Philippine peso, and to a lesser extent, the Thai baht,”** said Trang Thuy Le, a strategist at Macquarie Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. When the yen and yuan both fall, “the pressure can translate to dollar buying and hedging demand for those exposed to emerging-market currencies,” she said.

Regarding what to do with the money, you guys are right that I should definitely take some advantage of this bear market with an eye for the long term retirement goals now.  Since I'm pretty sure I'll want a house within 5-10 years from now, my new plan based off everyone's advice is this:   


1. Put $10k immediately into an I-bond, do this again on Jan 1st with another $10k, repeat every year.
2. Put roughly $200k into 1 year Treasury Bills to be a down payment on a house within the next 10 years
3. Dollar cost average the remainder (\~300k) over the next year into index funds for retirement
4. The 401k beneficiary account money (\~12.5k every year after taxes) I'll just use as supplementary income. I'm lucky enough that $55k a year has been fine to live on, but extra money is definitely helpful in Los Angeles.

Hello! My (41F) mother passed away about eight months ago and we're finally settling up the estate. For my sister and I, this includes mainly:

\*Mom's house assessed at 1.2mil at time of death (paid off)\*Mom's 401k which will roll over into two beneficiary accounts for my sister and me (about 160k each)

My sister and her son will be staying in Mom's house to live, so my sister will be buying me out of Mom's house. I'm thrilled they're going to be staying there and it's staying in the family, plus it's in a great school district for my special needs nephew.

I (apparently mistakenly) thought that my sister buying me out would mean I'd be bumped into a higher tax bracket from all the extra money, but after speaking to my accountant, he told me it qualified for stepped up basis and that I wouldn't be taxed on it. So after a few expenses are taken out (\~$20k for safety repairs on the house including a new roof, $140k that my mom wanted left to my nephew, $19k to my sister for taking care of my mom full time for the last 7 months of her life and taking on the brunt of the estate work and a few other sundry things), I'm expecting about $500k from the house ""sale."" My questions are these:

1. At the moment with the stock market being the nightmare it is, I'm planning on parking the 500k between two 1-year CDs at different banks (at the moment the interest rate is 3% APY at both banks I'm considering) until I can think of what to do more long-term.  Is this the best option for the moment?
2. For the beneficiary account, my tax person said the usual 10% over 10 years withdrawal is a fine way to go to not increase my tax liability if I withhold 15% Federal and 5% State for taxes. Does this sound about right?
3. Any red flags or things I should be aware of as we move forward?

For background: I make about 55k/year, rent a great apartment in California with a roommate, no debt, excellent credit, my car is paid off, I max out a Roth IRA every year (which I only started three years ago, sigh), and have a decent emergency fund. I don't really plan on buying a house anytime soon.

I want to invest this money into paying down some of my debt, but yet I also want to use this money to purchase a multi family home to rent out. Anyone have any suggestions?

13k 12% interest car payment 
2.2k 0% interest Best Buy card
1.7k 0% interest PayPal Credit
$300 0% interest snapon tools

personalfinance,Should we sell our home to get out of debt?,"My husband and I bought our house for $195,000 in 2018 and refinanced last year with a 3.25% interest rate. We still owe about $190,000.  We have about $60,000 in debt, so we’re really struggling each month to pay any of it down. Currently, since the housing market is skyrocketing, similar houses in our neighborhood are selling for about $400,000! Is now a good time to sell?? 

If we sold, we could use the extra ~$200,000 to pay off all our debt and have a savings!! At that point we could rent for a while, waiting for the housing market to crash, and use the extra cash as a hefty down payment. Or we could buy a smaller, cheaper home for about $200,000 (that will not compare to the home we bought for a similar price just a few years ago).  Another option is to not sell and get a home equity loan to pay off the debt. 

One concern is how long until the market crashes? When if finally does crash, Will prices of houses go back down, or just interest rates?

Given the volatility of the UK right now, I'm wondering what you guys think would be the best bet for this money. I'm looking at bringing it here at some point anyway, but my options are basically:  


1) Transfer now, and make do with the current '''stable''' exchange rate today.  
2) Wait, and watch the E. Asian market have another fit, obliterating the GBP once again tomorrow.  
3) Wait, and the BofE hikes interest rates, making the exchange more favourable before an inevitable economic recession.

stocks,(9/26) Monday's Pre-Market Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, September 26th, 2022-

*****

# [Dow futures fall 200 points as the British pound hits record low against the dollar](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. equity futures fell on Monday as surging interest rates and foreign currency turmoil threatened to push the S&amp;P 500 to a new closing low for the year.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 210 points, or 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The British pound dropped to a record low on Monday against the U.S. dollar. Sterling at one point fell 4% to an all-time low of $1.0382. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive hiking campaign, coupled with U.K.’s tax cuts announced last week has caused the U.S. dollar to surge. The euro hit the lowest vs. the dollar since 2002. A surging greenback can hurt the profits of U.S. multinationals and also wreak havoc on global trade, with so much of it transacted in dollars.
*****
&gt; “Such U.S. dollar strength has historically led to some kind of financial/economic crisis,” wrote Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist, in a note. “If there was ever a time to be on the lookout for something to break, this would be it.”
*****
&gt; On Friday, stocks ended a brutal week with the blue-chip Dow finding a new intraday low for the year and closing lower by 486 points. The broad-market S&amp;P 500 temporarily broke below its June closing low and ended down 1.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1.8%.
*****
&gt; Traders will be closely watching the S&amp;P 500 on Monday for any break below its bear market low. The S&amp;P’s low close for the year in June was 3,666.77. It closed Friday at 3,693.23 after trading briefly below that close. The benchmark’s intraday low for the year is 3,636.87. Any trade below those levels could drive more selling in the market.
*****
&gt; Another super-sized rate hike by the Federal Reserve last week was the catalyst for the latest leg downward in markets. The central bank indicated it could raise rates as high as 4.6% before pulling back. The forecast also shows the Fed plans be aggressive this year, hiking rates to 4.4% before 2022 ends.
*****
&gt; Bond yields soared after the Fed enacted another rate hike of 75 basis points. The 2-year and 10-year Treasury rates hit highs not seen in over a decade. On Friday, Goldman Sachs slashed its year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 to 3,600 from 4,300.
*****
&gt; Rates were surging again on Monday wit the 2-year Treasury topping 4.29%.

stocks,$GCT- Quiet period ends Sept 27,"What do y'all think about $GCT??? I wanted to reallocate my gains from $AVCT into something and finally landed on $GCT.  It pumped after its ipo and crashed back down to its low.  Thing is though, they're not a trash Chinese pumpco - they make serious revenue ($414M last year) in the b2b e-commerce space and operate globally.  Yes with interest rates increasing we can expect a slowdown in sales, but at its current sp the market cap is only  $521M!!! 

To put into perspective, that's a PS Ratio of 1.25, whereas Amazon's PS ratio is 2.47.  That's almost half.  in other words, GCT looks undervalued by a lot right now.  

On top of all this, the quiet period ends on Sept 27 and earnings will be reported on Sept 30.  Could be some real momentum this week!

personalfinance,Receiving part of an inherited IRA--is there anything else I should do?,"I'm receiving an inherited IRA of about $6,000 and it's from Edward Jones. I think the best move is to put it in my Roth IRA retirement fund thru Fidelity, but I wanted to ask here to see if I'm missing anything else. It'll be subject to taxes, 10% of federal tax. It's coming from NC to FL. I'm assuming there's no alternative funds or anything to avoid that? Lmao. I have a parent who wanted me to investigate that.

And for the record, I've got about $20k in the bank, ~$40k salary (part time 1099/part time W2 worker so it fluctuates depending on my freelancing). Just wondering if there's any other funds that would be better or more tax advantageous to do it. 

At this moment in my life I still live w a roommate and am keeping my expenses low. Just trying to save for an eventual (distant future) house, and an international vacation.

personalfinance,Unsure of what to do about house buying,"My spouse (34) and I (33) have been thinking of buying a house for the couple of years but it seemed out of reach, and now it seems we've blown it with interest rates rising. Any advice on if we should look to buy, or if we should continue to rent? We have a bit of a unique cash situation as we received a large unexpected inheritance a couple of months ago that we're unsure of what to do with.

Currently rent a 1bdrm for $2200, landlord isn't going to increase the rent and we're happy here. However, I work from home and we have a dog so it's cramped, and we want to have a kid sometime in the next 3 years. We live in a VHCOL city, and won't be able to afford to stay in our current neighborhood.

\-Salary: combined \~$155k-170k/year depending on bonuses, jobs are fairly recession proof

\-Retirement: each of us have about $100k saved between 401ks and Roth IRAs, and we fully max them out each year now.

\-Cash Savings: Have a 50k emergency fund, and then we have \~450k sitting in a couple of saving accounts from the inheritance that we're stuck on what to do with

\-Investments: \~200k in stocks outside of retirement accounts

\-No debt

The townhouses in our city are priced starting around $650k for a small 2 or 3 bedroom depending on location. For larger homes that are updated, those prices start around $750k and up. Not interested in leaving the city.

Up until a couple of months ago getting a house seemed out of reach for us with our salaries, but now we have money. With interest rates being higher, we could  put down a larger down payment so it would be more comfortable monthly, but dont know if that's responsible. Just nervous of putting down a large chunk of cash in the next couple of months and then the economy and housing prices tank.",finance,1664199761
personalfinance,Large downpayment or pay more towards monthly payments?,"ELI5 please :)

We will be in the market for a new (to us) vehicle in about 3-4 years. We are looking to buy a used Toyota Highlander Hybrid (3rd row for the kids, hybrid for gas milage benefits, Toyota for reliability and cost of repair). My last Highlander lasted 21 years and was a gem of a car so we are fairly set on it.   For our most recent car purchase, we put a relatively large downpayment down and are only making extra payments when we can. I'm now wondering if there would have been a more fiscally savvy way to do it? This will be my husbands primary vehicle and we plan to drive both of these vehicles for as long as they are drivable.

Should I pay the minimum downpayment and plan on putting any extra we have saved up towards monthly payments? One big extra payment after we acquire financing? Or do what we did last time and pay more upfront?  Is there a break-even point? Obviously I know that buying in cash is ideal but that will not be possible, and we are in a position to finance responsibly. Our credit is excellent so a high interest rate won't be an issue for us, though inflation could certainly affect things.

Lots of developing countries with  foreign debt exposure risk a new Sovereign debt crisis (it's a classic scenario, read Ray Dalio for a detailed explanation), Europe will collapse this winter because of skyrocketing energy prices and the ECB rising rates will probably cause another, big Sovereign debt crisis there...just look at italian bond yields how they rose and this is nothing because the ECB barely moved interest rates.

The situation in Ukraine is escalating, after the fake referendum Russia will probably declare war and even nukes are a possibility. The decoupling with China is further straining our economy. And in November we'll stop draining the strategic oil reserve fund so oil prices will soar again. I can't see a single indicator that it's bullish.

If you are bullish write the reasons why you're bullish.

P.S: I have to add another reason. With bond yields rising so much, for the first time since 2007 there is now a convenience to invest part of the money to the bond markets. Rates are gonna stay high for years (check the yield curve) and so a big part of capital will never go back to the stock market limiting the upside from here.

personalfinance,Cash for this car or a loan?,"I have a car on order that should be arriving in October. It will be around $50k out the door, including sales tax.  I have about $70k in the bank, which includes emergency savings. A 6-mo emergency fund should be about $36k for me. I was counting on selling the old car ($10k) and another approx. $10k is on its way toward the end of the year due to a government Covid employer refund/program. 

I was originally going to finance part of the car, but now interest rates are higher. IF I had the government money in-hand, and the car-sale money, no problem, I'd spend $30k out of the bank, add the $20k to it and still have $40k in savings. However, I don't. 

I am still thinking if I pay cash, I could get a loan against it later, avoid the dealer financing requirements, etc. My current car is 15 years old and I haven't had a car payment since 2013. My take-home is about $8000/mo (gross $15k/mo), not counting my spouse's income. I can save back $2k/mo without effort. I have had $1-$2k in unplanned expenses over the past several months, so I should really be able to save $4k per month, but stuff keeps coming up--dogs, cats, kid's dental work, etc., so I don't want to count on that. There is other college money (not going to be needed) that I funded and my husband has money in the bank, if things really went sideways, but these are the numbers for the money that I personally manage and would spend.

Alternatively, I was going to throw more money at the house, which we only owe $100k on, but we have that at 2.625% vs. a car loan which would be over 4%.

Groceries: $400 average
Entertainment: biggest fluctuator, I’d say $400 average too. We’re willing to make some cut backs.

Something else to note is our wedding is in May. We are set to pay out about 10k combined for that but not until closer to that time frame so we’re setting aside money now for that. We had to pay for our wedding ourselves to we set a 15k budget for ourselves.

If you think we can handle $2900, how much higher do you think we could go? We like to prepare on the high end.

I know we’re set back by retirement. We do want to start being wiser about that but us having a home feels important since right now my office is in the living room and we really want our dog to have a backyard and to entertain. There’s lots of reasons for it.

personalfinance,Debt Payoff Plan- Am I Missing Anything?,"Hello, all. Below is my monthly budget, debts and my plan to get myself out of debt and bolster my savings. Please tell me if there is anything I'm not taking into consideration.

Main Income: $2,750 (take home)
Rent Paid to Me From SO: $300
Side Income: ~$500 (take home)

My monthly expenses are:
-Mortgage: $520
-Utilities (gas, water, electric, wifi): ~$445
-Car Insurance: $48
-Subscriptions (TV, music, home security): $50
-Phone: $100
-Savings: $40
-Minimum Credit/Loan Payments: $961
-Groceries: $240
-Gas: $60
-Dog: $75
-Home/Beauty/RX: $70
-Car Maintenance: $20
-Healthcare (Co-Pays): $20
-Birthdays/Events: $20
-Fast food/fun money: $40
Total: $2,709

With my main income and rent payment from my SO, that leaves me a little over $300 a month for additional savings or debt payments. I recently got a second job to pay off my debt faster and will bring in around $500 more a month, thus bringing me to about $800 a month to throw at debt and savings.

My total CC and loan debts are right around $30k, most with interest rates over 10%.

My savings recently got depleted when I had to repair my car (but fortunately covered the entire cost) so I'm down to $300 in savings.

My plan is to begin with savings and save $3,000 first to cover just over a month's expenses. Then, I plan to pay down my smaller CCs which also have the highest interest rates. From there, I'm leaning toward rolling those minimum payments into the $800 a month and continue paying down my CCs (all about the same interest %) from smallest to largest and continuing to roll one payment into the next, followed by my loans. From there (which is a ways off!) I plan to build a 6 month emergency savings.

In the last month, this budget has worked well for me. I reduced my car insurance payment by $90 and I'm looking into switching phone plans, but I'm hesitant to change companies because of the coverage issues in the rural area I live. I've been trying to be more conscience of my water/electric usage because those cost me over $350 most months. Are there other ways you can see that I could reasonably trim my budget? Does this plan seem realistic?

Thank you to any and all advice! And before anyone harshly judges my circumstances, I realize this is a lot of debt to carry. I went through a divorce that left me with $20,000 of what I owe and I spent above my means during the bad period of my life that followed, thus getting myself to the $30k hole I'm in now.

Every time central banks raise interest rates it kills supply production of goods first. For example in real estate they stop building new homes and then later the price drops. The production of new supply gets cut first which just esclates the problems. 

Another case study is when QT takes place it cost the government more due to lack of efficency. Bob loses his job and stops buying $100/week in food, now he goes to the food bank and get $200/week in food and throws half of it away because they give him a bunch of crap his family doesn't like.

personalfinance,loan disbursement mistake,"Last week (9/20) I took a loan out to consolidate my credit cards. The APR &amp; interest rates were way better and could pay the loan off more quickly than I could the credit cards. 

Well, I had one major problem with this. I had the loan directly deposited to the cards for payoff, as it would have a lower interest.  In my haste, I accidentally typed one of the card numbers incorrectly. I noticed the payment didn't go through, so I waited in hopes that it was just processing. Today I looked at the loan agreement and I switched two numbers on one of the cards, so it's been deposited in the wrong account. 

- Called loan servicer, they said the payment was accepted and they can't take it back. Told me to call credit card company.
- called Capitol One, told them the likely account number (as I mixed up the last 4). They said they can't see it in someone's account and if it is in another account, they can't take it back. Told me to call loan servicer.
- Loan servicer says there's nothing they can do. Unless the credit card company finds it and marks it as a mistake, they can't do anything.  He said ""if they can kick it back, we can do a three way call to have it moved.""

personalfinance,Selling house - what to do with proceeds? (Commercial mortgage on new house),"**Key facts**

New house: 6-year non-conforming commercial mortgage (zoning issue). $180k balance. $150k balloon payment in 6 years. 6% interest rate.

Old house: High demand rapidly selling neighborhood (so not likely to sit). Estimated to gain \~$185k after sale.

**Details**

We needed to move ASAP and found a great house, but it was zoned commercial and we had to finance it with a 6-year commercial mortgage. Refinancing would be difficult, as only a single local lender who would finance initially. We used most of our $60k emergency fund for the down payment.

Our old house is expected to sell for enough to give us at least $185k after mortgage, fees, etc. We lived in it nearly all of the last 5 years with no renters. Old house is located in Missouri.

New house has a balance of $180k with a 6% interest rate. We will have a balloon payment due on it in 6 years of $150k. New house is located in Illinois. We are probably looking at about $60k in upgrades we want to do on the house over the next 5 years as well.

We could restore the entire emergency fund in 9 months regardless of what we do with the sale proceeds.

That leaves a lot of options for the proceeds, and we could do more than one of these.

* Restore the emergency fund?
* Pay off the new mortgage?
* Pay down the new mortgage so we pay less in interest and more in principal over the next 6 years?
* Set aside $150k in low risk investment for balloon payment?
* Invest some/all in other investments? (What risk level?)
* Reserve funds for upgrades? (Where to keep in the meantime)

The balloon payment combined with the depleted emergency fund both make this feel complicated to me, not to mention having enough to do more than one option.",finance,1664227901
personalfinance,"Leaving state employment. Should I purchase service credit to reach 10 years service with NVPERS, so I can collect retirement at 62 vs 65?","I am trying to figure out if this will benefit me long term or be a wash. I am leaving state service (NV) for federal employment. I have 9.3 years currently and I am 37 years old. 

I can purchase the remaining .7 years to reach 10 years of state service and be eligible to collect NVPERS retirement benefits at age 62 instead of 65. 

Monthly benefit if I do nothing is :$1300/month starting at age 65. Monthly benefit if I purchase the service credit is: $1400/month starting at age 62.

It costs $11,300 to purchase the remaining months of service credit. I currently have $20,000 on my deferred comp account (457b) all in S&amp;P500. I can roll over the $11,300 from that account to purchase the service credits, tax free. 

My plan is to retire at age 60 with 20 years of federal service. So I will be collecting FERS at 60 but can’t collect SS until 62. 

I would also be subject to the Windfall Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO). So I have no clue how that factors in…

|Loan|Current Principal|Interest Rate|Minimum Monthly Payment|Payments Remaining (If paying only minimum)|

Assume  emergency funds exist and all debts except mortgages paid off. Inflation, last I looked, is 8.2%.  let's say we assume inflation isn't going away but will be reduced by the Fed's current efforts. 

I'm considering three options right now: 

1. Pay down  a mortgage on a rental property at 4.5% interest. This is a variable rate loan and the rate will adjust (likely up) in three years. I'm worried the payment will increase and make the rental less profitable. If I pay it down substantially I can renegotiate a lower principal and lower payment even with high interest.

2. Pay down a fixed rate mortgage at 4.3%. this rate will not change, and has maybe seven years until it is paid off. 

3. Get an iBond at 9.5% interest and pay some of these debts later when the investment has grown.


Now it seems that paying off a mortgage later during a period when  inflation is high means I'm paying with cheaper dollars in the future. As long as the inflation is more than the interest, this should result in paying less in tems of  present-value dollars, no? 

Would a person be better off with a safe  investment that beats inflation, paying these debts later rather than paying off these debts now?  or better off just paying down debt?",finance,1664241617

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Conspiracies,"There is an insane level of manipulation in the markets. So I want to put out there some ongoing conspiracies that I see constantly coming up in comments and news articles.


**1. Exchanges are purposely liquidating leverage traders**



Exchanges set minuscule trading fees to attract new customers and are constantly making money on every single trade, every single second. They don’t care if a shitcoin is pumping or a blue chip crypto, they make money either way. What has been coming up is their insider info about number of longs and shorts. Leverage traders expect a certain event, but you see these opposite pumps/dumps before heading the market direction. These “fakeouts” seem to be artificially created. Today’s charts is an example. The day the fed raised interest rates by 75bps was another. Why just earn 0.002% of a trade when you can get the whole pie.



**2. Whales determine the market direction, shrimps float along believing they are special**



A $5 billion dollar account can make or break an entire event. Articles will come out with things like “BTC is soaring!” “Bulls are back in town!” When in reality a single investor is pumping their own bags and using every day traders for whatever objective. It’s hard to believe there are institutions and individuals with hundreds of millions or billions of play money, but here we are, welcome to capitalism. 



**3. Institutional investors are good for crypto**



Blackrock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, whatever bank in whatever country, are **NOT** your friends. They will more likely aim to dump the entire market down to enter at the lowest possible point than buy at market value. Think corporate raiders. These scumbags manipulate everything, they are all part of the same club, have the SEC in their back pocket, and love screwing the little guy. With institutional investors came high speed algorithmic trading that correlated crypto to traditional markets. 



**4. CBDCs will replace stablecoins**



Governments realised crypto is here to stay. It exploded from billions into the trillions for market cap. They aren’t about to let any third party company gain and keep all the benefits going forward. Taxation laws, listing requirements, and control over where money sits when not invested in a coin. “Protecting investors” is the all time favourite jargon. “We are spying on you for your safety”.",cryptocurrency,1664245657

I've been seeing a lot of posts asking about where to put cash and I never see floating rate treasuries mentioned. If purchased through an ETF like USFR, they have instant liquidity. So no lockups like CDs or buying treasuries directly.

The current SEC yield is 2.87% and has been increasing on a near daily basis. The best part about that yield increasing? The price of the ETF isn't going down as a result. This is because the effective duration is .02, basically nothing. Other bond funds have much higher effective duration and these ETFs have lost more in principle than they've paid out in interest lately. USFR's price hasn't moved in 5 years.

&gt;The yield curve “suggests” that US monetary policy has not been this restrictive since the ‘80s. As measured by the 2-year Treasury yield relative to the 10-year Treasury yield, it has inverted by 50 basis points, the 10-year yield at 3.75% compared to the two-year at 4.25%.  
&gt;  
&gt;In ARKInvest’s view, US monetary policy is significantly more restrictive than in the ‘80s when, to kill inflation, **Fed Chair Volcker pushed the Fed funds rate up two-fold from 10% to 20%. Chair Powell and team have increased it 13-fold from 0.25% to 3.25% to slay the dragon.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Under Volcker, the increase in long Treasury yields was 1.6X, from 10% to 16%, compared to 7.4X, from 0.5% to 3.7% under Powell and team. Risk aversion is pummeling all assets except cash, but the Fed seems fixated on hiking rates another 100+ basis points to protect its legacy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, commodity prices as measured by Refinitiv’s CRB index have dropped \~42% since their peak in mid 2008, \~25% since their lower peak in 2011, and \~19% since an even lower peak earlier this year.

&gt;A 58% increase in the trade-weighted dollar since early 2008 helps to explain the **deflationary forces that are building** in the pipeline once again. Most commodities are priced in dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;The inflation surge in the late seventies/early eighties had been brewing for 15 years, starting with the  Vietnam War and The Great Society social programs in 1964 and exacerbated by the end of the gold-exchange standard in 1971.  
&gt;  
&gt;By the time this Fed tackled the current surge, inflation had been brewing for \~15 months, not 15 years. Now, it is “keeping at it” with a sledgehammer 13 times more powerful than the one Volcker wielded in the ‘80s. In so doing, the Fed could undermine its legacy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, Japan and China sold dollars to protect their currencies against a parabolic dollar that is causing significant harm to the global economy. In other words, they are starting to “ease” dollar-based monetary policy by putting more dollars into the system.  
&gt;  
&gt;Japan’s and China’s dollar sales could be the first sign that “monetary easing” is on the way. The dollar’s parabolic move has been devastating to the rest of the world and should come back to bite US competitiveness, jobs, and  and economic activity, forcing the Fed to pivot.

Or is she just throwing around numbers to gaslight you into questioning the bear market.

She won't let go of the pivot argument.

She keeps harping on the ""13 fold"" increase

but really, does it even matter how many fold it is when we're just talking about a measly 3.25%  compared to volker 20%? 🤔",finance,1664257051
Forex,Would the pound fall on tax cut announcement if BOE rates were equal to Fed Fund rate?,"We are well aware of the pound falling when tax cuts were announced in UK. My understanding is that it is due to the massive borrowing UK has to do to cover these tax cuts.

However I have two questions:

1) Why would massive borrowing weaken the pound vs USD? 

2) Would this weakening happen if the BOE rate is already higher than Fed Fund rate when tax cuts were announced?

stocks,Vonvovia SE - what are some european stocks you believe are fairly valued?,"It seems that a lot of negativity is already prized in and there are a many stocks that have reached attractive levels. I am currently looking at the following stock:

&amp;#x200B;

**Vonovia SE**

Vonovia SE is the largest real estate company in Germany (they do own apartments in Austria and Sweden). They own 549.484 apartments in total (488.889 in Germany - 39.374 in Sweden - 21.221 in Austria). Around 2.2% of the apartments are vacant (as of June 30, 2022) - 3.0% in Sweden - 2.0% in Germany - 5.2% in Austria. 

For example, in Austria there are a new (2022) requirement for mortgages: 

\- minimum 20% down payment

\- maximum length of 35 years

\- monthly mortgage payment may not be more than 40% of monthly net income

&amp;#x200B;

It is undeniable that housing will always be needed and now that interest rates are rising (therefore making mortgages more expensive) less people can afford to buy apartments which in turn helps Vonvovias business. 

Furthermore, the current crisis in Ukraine is also beneficial as many Ukrainians have come to Germany (more than 915.000 registered as of August - 353.424 are registered with employment agencies, job centers, local authorities) 

\--&gt; [https://www.dw.com/en/is-support-for-ukrainian-refugees-waning-in-germany/a-62745596#:\~:text=But%20if%20hard%20figures%20are,centers%2C%20and%20other%20local%20authorities](https://www.dw.com/en/is-support-for-ukrainian-refugees-waning-in-germany/a-62745596#:~:text=But%20if%20hard%20figures%20are,centers%2C%20and%20other%20local%20authorities).

&amp;#x200B;

Intermin Financial Report for 2022 H1: [https://report.vonovia.de/2022/q2/en/](https://report.vonovia.de/2022/q2/en/)

P/E of 8.55

Div yield of 7.74% (payout ratio of less than 70% - so the dividend does not seem to be in immediate danger)

Market cap around 17B

EPS 2.51

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

They have around 70B in debt (vast majority is long term debt), however, their total assets are around 106B (debt to assets around 65%). Management recognized this problem and put apartments on the market which should bring in 13B and deleverage the company. 

Political risk is also a potential problem. The german government could impose new policies (like further limiting the amount of rent Vonovia can demand per tenant). 

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, I believe the market overreacted and the stock is currently fairly priced with a good margin of safety.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also looking at Vestas (wind turbines), ING (bank with pretty good dividend), BASF SE (largest chemical company in the world - hit pretty hard by the war in Ukraine), however, I did not do extensive dd on these.",finance,1664275929

# [Stock futures rise as S&amp;P 500 and Dow try to bounce back from lowest levels since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/stock-futures-are-little-changed-after-sp-500-closes-at-lowest-level-since-2020.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 tried to bounce back from their lowest closing levels in nearly two years.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 157 points, or 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The British pound rebounded slightly after plunging to a record low against the dollar earlier in the week. Sterling traded more than 1% higher at $1.087 per dollar after hitting an all-time low of $1.0382.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields also came off their highs, boosting sentiment. The benchmark 10-year yield dipped nearly 5 basis points to 3.823%.
*****
&gt; The move in futures comes after five straight days of losses for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at its lowest level since 2020. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20% below its record high. The 30-stock average also posted its lowest closing level since late 2020.
*****
&gt; Technical indicators show that the selling has been historic. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the 10-day advance decline line for the S&amp;P 500 has hit a record low, meaning market breadth is at its worst level in at least 32 years.
*****
&gt; The latest round of selling appears to have several catalysts, including an aggressive Federal Reserve and surging interest rates, which in turn have roiled currency markets. On Monday, the British pound slid to a record low against the dollar, unnerving investors on both sides of the Atlantic.
*****
&gt; “Typically, US investors wouldn’t care too much about something like this, and especially more recently. And so this to me says that now there is this fear that is gripping investors a lot more than it did before. That in turn will lead to a capitulation moment where we really are at a bottom,” said Max Gokhman, CIO at AlphaTrAI.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, investors will get several new pieces of economic data, including September consumer confidence, August durable goods orders and July home prices. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned that the Fed’s six-month-long inflation fight will push the economy into a recession.

personalfinance,Custom Home Building Experience,"Hey everyone,

My family is currently undertaking a custom home build project, and was interested in seeing if anyone else has recent experiences to share (especially in the current environment), as well as to sure my own experiences and things I’ve learned.

Our project started back in April last year when we purchased our lot - a nice wedge lot on a culdesac of an older community (most homes were built around 25 years ago - this was one of the last lots).  We paid $195k for the land.

We interviewed 3 custom home builders in our area.  Our goal was a 3500-3800 sq ft house, and we were hoping to be at around $1 million as an all in project cost (construction plus land).

We settled on a home builder we liked, and drew up preliminary architectural plans (they have an in-house architect we work with).  The initial estimate came in at around $1 million for the construction alone.  This was Summer 2021.

We proceeded with the project and with picking out all of our selections.  Meanwhile, building costs continued to rise.  

By the time we got to October or so last year, the house was trending at a $1.3 million construction cost.  At this point we were at 4300 sq ft for the main level and second level, plus about a 1600 sq ft finished walk out basement. 

At this point fed policy was starting to turn, and I was getting nervous about rates.  I worked with a local lender who was willing to give us a 240 day lock on a construction to permanent loan even with a signed final contract, which we locked in at 3% (this was based on a 20% equity loan).    

We continued into the winter making selections, and dealing with volatile material costs (including lumber).  Come March this year, the construction cost was estimated to be up to around $1.6 million.

Construction is now underway, but I’ve definitely learned a few things:

1).  Custom home builders do not give you very accurate estimates on the onset.  My feeling is they do not want to scare away clients.  Our project ended up double where we started.  Obviously a good portion of this was our fault, but we noticed the allowances for things like light fixtures were way under what was reasonable.  

2).  Landscaping is ridiculous now.  On top of these construction costs, we are looking at a minimum of around $200k in landscaping and hardscaping work. 

3).  Make sure the designer shows your wife the cheaper selections first.  

All in all I’m glad we are doing this now - if we had waited even a few more months this project would have been unaffordable given where interest rates ended up being.  With that said, if my April 2021 self knew what he was getting himself into cost wise, I probably would have ran, not walked from this project.  

Our build is set to be completed in May, and I’m guessing we will probably still be adding costs from here, it really never ends.  

My rule of thumb for people who are looking to do a home build project - take what you think your budget is, and double it.  That’s what you need.

Edit:  Just to be clear, I am not complaining about our build - merely sharing an experience with building a custom home.  Some of these replies got quite negative as if I was accusing our builder of doing something wrong.  I’m not.",finance,1664279657

Financing: the pro installers are giving a 25 year finance option which turns out to be ~$130/month. I currently pay 130/month on average so the only financial incentive is hedging my bet that over the next 25 years my energy costs will go up. TBH that's a safe bet but it's still not a great financial incentive. 
My biggest hurdle with the DIY route is finding a financer. I need some recommendations please. Preferably one that will allow me to pay in my fed rebate to lower monthly payment and finance it for greater than 8 years. I've been seeking home equity loans but I haven't found one that has a longer payback plan than 8 years. 

All advice is appreciated. I'm also considering just spending some of my down payment money to just better insulate my home yada yada",energy,1664289226

personalfinance,Need clarification on benefits of taking loan when interest rate is lower than inflation,"This question is particularly regarding taking out a loan for a specific purpose, let’s say buying a car.

I understand that when taking out a loan when inflation is high and interest rates are low you would be paying back less value as inflation increases, which is great. All good so far.

But I have a hard time to visualise how this benefit can be realised, unless I’m actively spending/investing the money I would have otherwise spent if I hadn’t taken the loan.

In my mind, if my spending habits are unchanged by paying outright for the car (I.e. it is easily affordable), then the only thing I am doing by taking the loan is losing money by paying the interest rate. 

At the end of the loan repayments I have less money, and the same car. So what value have I actually gained?",finance,1664290625

Let's go EV charging stocks  (CHPT) and utilities (DUK)...

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

All 50 states received final approval Tuesday to begin construction on a first nationwide network of EV charging stations that places one roughly every 50 miles (80 kilometers) along interstate highways, part of the Biden administration’s plan to spur widespread adoption of zero-emission cars.

The Transportation Department said it had OK’d EV charger plans from a last set of 17 states, triggering the release of $1.5 billion in federal funds to all jurisdictions nationwide — or $5 billion over five years — to install or upgrade chargers along 75,000 miles (120,000 kilometers) of highway from coast to coast, with a goal of 500,000 EV chargers nationwide. Plans for the other 33 states and the District of Columbia were approved earlier this month.

By year’s end, drivers could start seeing expansions and upgrades to existing highway EV stations in states such as California, Colorado, Florida and Pennsylvania that now feature at least four fast-charger ports, enabling EVs to fully recharge in about an hour.

Construction of new EV charging locations could begin by next spring.

“America led the original automotive revolution in the last century, and … we’re poised to lead in the 21st century with electric vehicles,” said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. He said the plans will “help ensure that Americans in every part of the country — from the largest cities to the most rural communities — can be positioned to unlock the savings and benefits of electric vehicles.”

The approval is a major step toward building widespread acceptance and use of electric vehicles among consumers, who most often express hesitancy over EVs’ shorter range and limited availability of public chargers. President Joe Biden has set a goal that 50% of new U.S. car sales be electric by 2030, and his administration touts new tax credits next year of up to $7,500 as making electric vehicles accessible for everyday Americans. Still, the five-year plans suggest a potentially long and bumpy road ahead for a highway EV network, with states citing risks such as a lack of electricity grid capacity, supply chain shortages and equity concerns.

For instance, while Texas, California and Florida say their grid should be able to handle increased capacity of a million or more EVs, other states aren’t so sure.

“Capacity will become a concern in future years as charging infrastructure and EVs become more ubiquitous,” New Mexico said in its plan.

Vermont wrote that “Unmanaged or unplanned for EV charging could cause utilities to incur significant costs to maintain grid reliability and create challenges for grid operators” and that some locations “may also necessitate intensive grid upgrades and buildout.”

Mississippi cited potential shortages of EV charging station equipment, which it said “may cause significant setbacks” in construction. Several states also expressed concern that they would not be able to acquire charging stations that meet the American-made provisions.

“It may delay implementation by several years,” New Jersey officials wrote.

Under the Transportation Department requirements, states also must focus first on more expensive fast chargers on highway routes that typically cost $40,000 to $100,000 to install, rather than keying in on neighborhoods and communities with Level 2 chargers that are cheaper but take a few hours to provide a full charge.

Currently, electric vehicle owners charge their vehicles at home 80% of the time, typically at single family houses. But that is likely to change as the less affluent who don’t have a garage to house a charging station buy EVs.

Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law provides an additional $2.5 billion for local grants to fill remaining gaps in the charging network in rural areas and in disadvantaged communities, which are less likely to own the higher-priced electric vehicles or have charging stations readily available near them. The Federal Highway Administration said Tuesday that it will begin taking applications for that money later this year.",finance,1664295798

I've spent the morning reading about TIPS, but I'm still having a hard time fully comprehending the potential risks.

Something I've seen repeated several times is that ""TIPS protect against *unexpected* inflation"".  So does this mean that, hypothetically, if the next CPI report comes in substantially lower than the market expects, TIPS would fall dramatically in price?  Or would the resulting expectation that the fed would slow down on rate hikes (in response to cooling inflation) help TIPS funds the same as it presumably would regular bond funds?

CryptoCurrency,Stablecoin Legislation has Officially Gone off the Tracks,"At the end of July, the big talk on The Hill was the Stablecoin Legislation that was being hashed out in the House Financial Services Committee between the Chairwomen Maxine Waters and Ranking Member Patrick McHenry. When I saw Ranking Member McHenry talk in person at an event it seemed that the two members were close to coming to an agreement. This came to a screeching halt when Treasury Secretary Yellen was shown the proposal by the Chairwomen’s staff and opposed several aspects of the legislation.

During the recess period, the Majority and Minority staff continued to work to try and bridge the gaps, and over the last week or so talk had again started to pick up that the bill would soon be introduced and marked up. Last Tuesday the Majority presented it to their members and the feedback was not good at all then again there was silence. Now we are starting to hear again what happened/what has gone sideways to get both sides rank and file committee members to oppose the legislation.

If I can find a way to get the draft legislation out from behind a paywall I will be sure to throw it in the comments below. In true legislative form though this draft is a whopping 73 pages long while each person is going to find their own issues with this legislation starting with it being legislation in general I want to highlight some issues that I am sure caused issues both between the parties and then within the parties themselves. 

1. The Federal Reserve would have oversight of stablecoins. This would run against what Secretary Yellen wants as she wants the Treasury in charge of stablecoins and a possible CBDC if the Fed gets stablecoins it means that if a CBDC is ever issued it would also most likely go to the Fed as well.

2. Granting the Federal Reserve oversight of state-level rules. This would result in states like New York which have very strict stablecoin policies being overruled by the Fed which is not something New York nor California Representatives would want. 

3. Interoperability standards being implemented by the Government is also sure to be a sticking point that is touched on. How this could be done and what all it means is not clearly defined so would the government require certain bridges and then would the government provide insurance on these bridges is a huge question.

4. Endogenously Collateralized Stablecoins… There have been a ton of rumors about the 2-year ban that would be in place but when looking at the bill…. Well, it is interesting as all “endogenously” collateralized stablecoins that currently exist would not be affected. Rather it would ban issuing, creating, or originating an endogenously collateralized stablecoin that is not yet in existence. 

	Also, certain “stablecoins” in circulation, some algorithmic stablecoins, would seemingly dodge the ban together since “In this section, the term ‘‘endogenously collateralized stablecoin’’ means any digital asset—
		(1) in which its originator has represented will be converted, redeemed, or repurchased for a fixed amount of 		monetary value; and
		(2) that relies solely on the value of another digital asset created or maintained by the same originator to maintain the fixed price.
These criteria hint at a loophole for cryptos if they have a price target since that is not something that is guaranteed as the price target changes as the market changes.  

5. Safe Harbors are limited. This has been something that has gained increased bipartisan backing as implementing a safe harbor would give cryptocurrencies time to adjust and fall in line with the law. This bill however puts the Fed in charge of offering limited safe harbors at their discretion. 


As with any draft, there are more issues with it however when I went through it these were the 5 biggest ones to me from either a regulatory perspective or a crypto-hodler perspective. If anything else comes out I will be sure to update this post to match it accordingly! If anyone has any questions about what all is in the draft bill and how it could impact certain things I will do my best to reply and help explain it but this is a draft bill and with the bipartisan negative feedback it will need to change in a pretty substantial way it appears.",cryptocurrency,1664297545

personalfinance,MBA financing strategy -- what should I do?,"I am planning (with any luck in the admissions process) to attend a T-15 MBA starting in the fall of 2023. Yes, I am set on this decision as something that makes sense for me now and in the long term... I realize it's quite an expensive decision both in terms of direct cost and opportunity cost, but I have done enough research and reflecting based on career path, projected earnings, etc. to have convinced myself about this decision in terms of ROI (combination of ""hard"" and ""soft"").

This post is about the best financing strategy for the MBA. Here are some features of my financial situation:

* 27 (single) in HCOL city
* Current annual income = \~$115K
* \~$140K net worth: \~$94K 401(k), \~$35K Roth IRA, \~$4K HSA, \~$2K real estate (Fundrise), \~$1.5K taxable brokerage, \~$1K crypto, \~$3K cash (recently had to dip into e-fund for taxes and other stuff so will be replenishing that quickly)
* Credit score = 785+
* Estimated total cost of MBA across 2 years including tuition, housing, food, etc. = $250K (conservative price tag for most expensive program on my list; I am not accounting for any potential scholarships, etc.)
* My family has extremely generously set aside $ to help pay for school = $120K in taxable brokerage account

QUESTION FOR DISCUSSION: What is the best way to approach payment of \~$250K in costs, particularly as it relates to assets and, most specifically, the $120K in taxable brokerage? Of course, I want to think holistically, as well. I am early in the process of exploring other posts / resources to understand the best strategy in terms of federal loans, private loans, etc. I have seen [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/u1cz6c/comment/i4brh3d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) suggesting that federal borrowing may be the way to go for domestic students versus paying cash / depleting assets.

So what might be the best here?

I assume that EDV will not pay much higher dividends in the future as its main holdings are 20+ year bonds.

EDV: treat a Bond Etf as something risky and take advantage of its low price and collect the dividends while waiting

stocks,Can passive investing work during periods of high inflation?,"For the last 40 years, we've had a systematic decline of inflation and interest rates. This is partly due to increased globalization, cheap labor, a ""peace dividend"", and cheap energy. As a result, markets have steadily trended up, and while there were crashes like the dot com or the 08 GFC, eventually the Fed was always able to step in to prop up assets since inflation was low.

Before this period, during 1966 - 1982, there was massive structural inflation, and the stock market went literally nowhere for 14 years. On an inflation adjusted basis, you would have lost money. No one was recommending to dollar cost average into a broad index, because it just didn't work. The incentive for a passive strategy simply didn't exist. In contrast to today's world, after 40 years of assets grinding higher as interest rates grinded lower, a psychological shift happened and the incentive for passive investing was born, as well as the rise of ETF's along with it.

With inflation now at 40 year highs and the Fed relentlessly raising interest rates, it seems impossible for an index ETF strategy to do well. Some might say as soon as we've dealt with inflation, things will go back to normal. Rates will go down, the market will go up, and all will be well.

The problem is, it doesn't seem that we're just going to slip back into a low inflation environment. We're dealing with deglobalization, geopolitical tensions, rampant inflation, and climate change, all of which is creating more competition for limited resources.

After Covid, the world realized it needs to onshore certain supply chains, and things like this along with Russia/Ukraine and rising tensions with China is having a deglobalizing effect, making input costs higher. In addition to these higher input costs, higher wages and Owners Equivalent Rent are proving to be sticky.

Jerome Powell said it appears we are entering ""a new normal"", referring to inflation being higher for longer, unlike the period from the last 40 years.

Little backstory, I’m 37 years old and business owner along with my business partner (50/50).  We have both worked at this company for 10 years and in 2020 were given the opportunity to purchase it.  We ran the company lean and we took two years to save and just closed on the business real estate a few months ago, so we now are in 100% control of the company and property.  Both business and real estate are appraised currently at 5.4million total.  In twenty years or so we will sell everything (I see this as my retirement amount).  Granted we don’t know what will happen in that time but that’s the long term plan.

At my business I’m also the general manager and my w2 salary is set to 60k a year.  I also receive around 100k a year in disbursements, around 25k every 3 months.  I’m married with two step daughters, one is a senior in college and the other is already in her career.  So they are good to go (no saving for college ect..).

I have zero retirement / investment.  I’ve got 30k saved.  I have a 11k personal loan.  

I plan on the next disbursement to wipe out my personal loan, her lending club and her medical.  Everything is culminating to be really good financially for her and I.

CryptoCurrency,The weird potential upside to a CBDC,"So... I've been thinking about the recent crypto downslide and bear market that seems to have been related,  in large part, to popular stablecoins depegging and causing a crisis of confidence in the crypto environment by the general population. I've also spent a good long time considering CBDCs and how they'll affect the crypto environment and I think I've stumbled upon an interesting benefit the CBDC might provide. 

First, I want to be clear that I am absolutely not a proponent of a CBDC which is why I hold cryptos and precious metals. I am not trying to endorse them in any way and I feel like a CBDC is being used, in part, to control the on and off ramps to the cryptosphere and to control people.

With that out of the way, I have a suspicion that a CBDC may stabilize the cryptosphere in that it would eliminate the need for questionable, paper backed stablecoins to be in the market at all. I know that people have some suspicion regarding how stablecoins are backed and if they are truly backed at all and I feel like a CBDC would take away a majority of the concern surrounding this issue. A dollar would literally be a dollar in this case.

Secondly, a CBDC is almost guaranteed to be a currency that only exists to be spent and it would not ever be considered a store of value (or at least I would never save in a currency that is constantly inflated w presumably negative interest rates). It is my suspicion that a CBDC could be used in tandem, and with government approval, with something like bitcoin in order to provide the citizenry an alternative to a traditional savings account which might actually push the general population into crypto put of necessity. 

Together,  I think these are a few of the unseen potential upsides to an otherwise awful situation. Try as we might, the wheels are already spinning for a CBDC so we can't do much to prevent it, however, I just wanted to point out a potential upside benefit to the crypto universe.

# Global Market Stress Is Piling Up. Something Is About to Break

*Central  banks have dialed up their resolve to combat inflation in recent weeks.  In response, markets have become so unmoored a major financial and  economic crisis can’t be ruled out. That means global monetary policy  hawkishness may have hit its peak and something will eventually  break. The impact on four big asset classes will be very different.*

## Things are starting to break

It’s [absolute mayhem](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-26/why-investors-are-facing-even-more-market-instability)  in global markets right now. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 re-confirmed a  bear market after sinking through the June lows and the two-year  Treasury bond has [sold off](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/treasuries-extend-losses-driving-yields-to-new-multi-year-highs)  for a record number of days. In the UK, the currency dropped to  all-time lows against the US dollar and government bond yields mounted  their highest climb ever in a two-day period. In Europe, German 10-year  yields breezed through the 2% barrier, having started the year with a  negative yield. In Japan, the central bank was forced to intervene in  currency markets as the yen fell to its lowest against the US dollar  since 1998. Italian bonds are taking it on the chin with 10-year  government bond yields rising above 4.5% for the first time since the  height of the sovereign debt crisis in 2013.

Something is [going to break](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-23/wall-street-risks-a-breaking-point-after-week-of-monetary-mania). The Fed’s resolve will soon face [its most pressing test](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-27/the-federal-reserve-s-inflation-fight-how-far-will-it-go).  There are so many stressors piling up, it truly is the everything risk  right now. Policymakers cannot possibly put out all the fires. One of  these economic pathogens will metastasize into a full-blown crisis. And  that’s when the policy about-face will come. How this plays out in four  distinct financial markets -- equities, fixed income, currencies and  housing — will differ.

The dizzying rise in the dollar is the most worrying development because episodes of prolonged dollar strength usually [end in crisis](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/morgan-stanley-s-wilson-says-dollar-surge-tends-to-end-in-crisis?srnd=premium). The good news for fixed income investors is that a crisis would cap [bond losses](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-24/the-great-bond-bubble-is-poof-gone-in-worst-year-since-1949).  Crisis or not, stocks are still in for a slow grind as earnings  disappoint for many more quarters into the future. Housing will suffer,  too.

## The Fed is hurting housing but not labor...yet

A  litany of market strategists are screaming for the Fed to relent,  advising that inflation has peaked. But central banks can’t sit idly by  as the cost of living crisis punishes households. Much of the inflation  issue is related to supply constraints — a lack of qualified labor or a  lack of industrial capacity to meet demand. Lacking supply-side tools  and committed to bringing inflation down, central banks have decided to   crunch demand to bring it in line with the diminished supply.

When  the latest US inflation numbers came out showing core CPI at an  annualized rate of 7%, Bloomberg Economics projected that  “gas prices  will weigh on the CPI in September, while core inflation accelerates.”  Such numbers would virtually guarantee more hawkishness from the Fed —  and a rise of three-quarters of a percentage point in rates in November,  right before the US mid-term election.

So  far, the rise in interest rates hasn’t cooled the labor market though.  Weekly initial jobless claims remain low and the number of continuing  claims has actually fallen recently. That’s a good thing for laborers.  But it also adds incentive for the Fed to raise rates because of the  worry that high inflation in a tight labor market will feed through into  wages and then back into goods and services when companies pass those  wage costs onto customers.

The one area where the impact of the Fed’s rate hikes is visible is housing. Mortgage rates are now up to 6.3%, the [highest since 2008](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-22/mortgage-rates-in-us-jump-to-6-29-highest-since-october-2008).  If you look at GDPNow, the Atlanta Fed’s tracker of GDP, almost all of  the weakness is coming from housing. After the latest housing starts  report from the US Census Bureau, the most recent update said “the  nowcast of third-quarter residential investment growth decreased from  -20.8 percent to -24.5 percent.” It’s this massive reduction in  residential investment that has their GDP estimate for the third quarter  just barely positive at 0.3%. Outside of housing, the US economy is  doing just fine. So the full force of the Fed’s policy moves clearly  haven’t filtered through into the wider economy yet.

## The US dollar rules over everything

The  resilience in the US economy has allowed the Fed to grow increasingly  hawkish. The result is not just higher interest rates and lower equity  prices but also a strong dollar. That currency effect forces other  central banks to take hawkish action themselves, putting additional  downward pressure on global economies. The UK is the [perfect example](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/uk-meltdown-raises-specter-that-bond-vigilantes-are-returning).

The  Bank of England has been raising rates at a steady quarter- or  half-percentage point rate at each policy meeting. However, that pace  hasn’t kept up with the Fed, adding to the pressure on the British  pound. Then, last week, in an effort to boost growth, the new British  government announced tax cuts that [went far beyond](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-23/uk-bonds-plunge-as-uk-dmo-ramps-up-gilt-sales-more-than-expected) what markets had expected -- at a time when the labor market is tight, inflation is high and the currency is falling.

Markets  reacted negatively and violently sending the pound to a record low  against the US dollar. Bonds had their worst selloff in decades and the  stock market fell. The message is that any central bank that doesn’t  keep pace with the Fed will face the same unpalatable policy choice:  either allow their currency to weaken, hence fueling more inflation,  or take rates higher, eventually suffocating the domestic economy.

These economic strains and the associated market volatility raise the risk of [liquidity draining ](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/dollar-swaps-face-biggest-collapse-since-fed-2011-liquidity-plan) in  safe assets that will eventually produce a credit crunch. The ructions  we have experienced over the past week simply can’t continue without  something breaking. Credit crunches are inherently deflationary events.  So, if central banks press on and something does break, it will subdue a  lot of the built-up inflationary pressure, forcing an about-face in  policy.

## By the numbers

* May 2002 The last time the US dollar was stronger than today

## What comes next?

The  tricky part is knowing exactly which dams will break or when it will  happen. My base case is that we see market stresses build to a  flashpoint next quarter, forcing a climb-down from central banks and an  easing of the pace of rate hikes. Here’s how I see it playing out  in bonds, equities, currencies and housing.

In  the US government bond market, the yield curve is inverted, with  investors getting lower coupons for longer-maturity debt. This inversion  is unusual because investors need to be compensated for the risk of  holding assets over a longer period of time. It generally only happens  before recessions because markets anticipate rate cuts.

By  the time the Fed’s policy rate hits 4% in November or December, a  credit crunch will be visible and the rate hikes will slow. With 10-year  Treasury yields already approaching 4%, we’re very near a peak  in long-term yields. Two-year yields are even higher, near 4.30%,  indicating that top is also close. Getting a decent yield without  concern it will climb much further is an attractive investment. Some  investors, like DoubleLine’s Jeffrey Gundlach are [  already buying](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/gundlach-starts-buying-as-10-year-us-yields-set-for-record-spike).

In  equities, the environment is most akin to the early 2000s because the  elevated valuations of the pandemic can only be supported in the most  benign earnings environments. I expect earnings to [continue to underwhelm](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-25/nasdaq-100-faces-10-drop-as-inflation-hits-tech-profits?srnd=premium)  for many quarters to come. That will put downward pressure on  valuations, even though a whole generation of investors will continue to  buy the dip under the false premise of missing out on the next rally.

They  may be misguided. We’ve already had four months of earnings downgrades  outpacing upgrades. My colleague Heather Burke writes that “struggling  US stocks are unlikely to see much relief from the upcoming  third-quarter earnings season”. And a recession of unknown depth and  duration likely lies ahead of us. All that suggests more earnings pain  to come. Just like during the period after the tech bust in 2000, the  drip-drip of earnings misses will exact a toll on investor psychology,  grinding equities lower until we see serious capitulation. After  that, the business cycles will be hopefully long enough to build gains.  That wasn’t the case from 1999 to 2012 and that was toxic for portfolio  returns.

In  currencies, because stress is building, the US dollar is getting bid.  And that will continue until we hit the flashpoint that causes central  banks to reverse course. But the dollar’s rise has become parabolic,  suggesting the moment of truth won’t take long.

I  believe we’re nearing a secular peak in the dollar. I wouldn’t be  surprised to see it much lower from here as it was after the double top  in 2001 and 2002.

Last  but not least is housing. In the US, housing has become increasingly  unaffordable due to the double whammy of lofty house prices and  rising interest rates. That’s driving people out of the market for home  purchases, thereby increasing the demand and prices of rental units.  Rent inflation is one of the biggest problems in the cost of living  crisis.

Fed  Chair Jerome Powell said outright at the last FOMC press conference  that his aim in raising rates is to cool house prices and rents. Some  markets are [already starting to show cracks](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/us-home-price-growth-slowed-in-july-as-housing-market-cools?srnd=premium).  The decline should not be as crisis-inducing as it was in the wake of  2008 because households carry much less debt now than they did at the  peak of the housing bubble.

Nevertheless,  as housing is the middle class’ principal asset, it will inflict enough  pain on consumer balance sheets to slow consumption and, thus,  inflation.

But it’s the dollar’s vertiginous rise that mostly suggests we’re nearing peak hawkishness. It’s a sign that investors are [seeking safe assets](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/traders-who-just-want-to-survive-sit-on-5-trillion-cash-pile?srnd=premium)  as fear pervades the market. This kind of market environment can’t last  without a release valve from policy or it ends in a crisis. When the  turn comes, it will be bullish for bonds but bearish for the dollar. It  will be a while before housing and equities can recover.",finance,1664326303

stocks,REITs under pressure - just a correction or time to get out?,"Looking at the charts of my REITs [Stag, Well, O, Vici, Wpc, Land] makes me sad currently. Before (first half of the year) most of them held stable (compared to the market) or even had run-ups. I assume that there are 3 factors involved currently:

- risk free rate was substantially corrected up with last Fed meeting. Why would I own a low growth company for 5% dividend when I can have a similar rate in 2 yrs treasuries

- house prices declined in July - so my underlying assets decline and with that the risk of even slower growth from potential new leases

- some of these stocks (stag, land) were over-hyped before or seen as save-haven (WPC, O) in case of a recession-only scenario

I will likely hold but wonder if my reasoning is sound / you know about other factors and would advice to get out.

This is inline preliminary reports from Fedex and Ford. Markets, consumer, economy, FX, and treasury yields continue to deteriorate badly, however inflation is hiding much of the pain in the numbers and statistics. Also note that headline CPI is clouded by releases from the SPR which is expected to end this October and energy is likely to spike in the winter due to the current EU/Russia conflict. 

I would also like to point out recent earnings from HD and SBUX where each reported lower volume but higher sales as a result of higher pricing. Inflation is extremely embedded into our economy, yet markets have not come to terms with the pain or the time (years) that will be required to bring it back to normal levels. 

There is also a very interesting dichotomy between corporate leaders and Fed officials. While many Fed officials see a softish landing or refuse to consider the possibility of a deep recession, note that some of the biggest CEOs have flagged a hard landing as early as summer.

While the S&amp;P has begun to come off lower towards the 15xish forward multiple, it should rightfully be at a lower multiple as a result of the higher rates. Additionally, earnings expectations have yet to come down. This is partly why many major banks have begun to forecast a S&amp;P in the low 3000s.

Fund is set to invest in private, public firms similar to those held by ARK's high-growth, technology-focused ETFs

Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management LLC on Tuesday debuted the ARK Venture Fund, the firm’s first foray into private investments.

The venture fund intends to invest in early- to late-stage private companies and publicly traded businesses similar to those held by ARK’s high-growth, technology-focused exchange-traded funds.

The ARK Venture Fund is available to U.S. investors, including individuals, for a minimum initial investment of $500 on the online investment platform of financial-technology startup Titan. Venture-capital funds traditionally limit access to accredited investors such as wealthy individuals or institutions.

“We think retail investors should have the right to participate in the value creation of the most exciting and successful technology companies on the planet, even if they’re private,” Maximilian Friedrich, a member of the ARK Venture Investment Committee and an analyst at the firm, said in an interview. “That is a value add that sets us apart from traditional venture capitalists, which often do not have a broad reach and audience with retail investors.”

Ms. Wood and ARK rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic when the firm’s ETFs posted huge returns as low interest rates and stimulus boosted investor appetite for riskier assets. Those bets have struggled this year as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates at an aggressive clip to try to curb persistent inflation, making unprofitable companies promising growth in the future a harder sell to investors. The flagship ARK Innovation ETF is down 61% in 2022, yet has seen steady inflows this year.

ARK plans to also offer access to the venture fund to registered investment advisers, family offices, high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors through other distributors down the line, according to Mr. Friedrich.

The fund has a target portfolio composition of 70% private companies and 30% public companies. Although traditional venture-capital funds often look for exit opportunities such as initial public offerings or acquisitions, ARK’s fund aims to continue holding portfolio companies after they enter public markets. ARK declined to name its initial portfolio companies.

The ARK Venture Fund is an interval fund, a vehicle that restricts withdrawals, but gives investors access to more illiquid assets less likely to trade on financial markets. ARK’s fund plans to offer quarterly redemptions capped at 5% of the fund’s net asset value, according to Mr. Friedrich.

The fund has a 2.75% management fee and anticipates distribution and other fees to total 1.47% in its first year of operation, assuming average net assets of about $250 million during that period, according to ARK. Investors won’t pay an additional platform fee to Titan for the fund. Interval funds in the U.S. have an average management fee of 1.4%, according to Morningstar Direct data tracking 72 funds.

ARK’s venture fund doesn’t have carried interest, a share of profits paid out to the fund’s managers. Venture-capital funds traditionally have a fee structure of a 2% management fee and 20% carried interest.

The launch of the fund comes as venture-capital deals have slowed this year amid a broader market downturn. Still, venture funding and startup valuations remain at some of the highest levels on record. ARK first filed to launch the venture fund in February and filed a fund prospectus in August.

“Not only is the Ark team via Titan able to provide retail access to venture, we’re doing it at a time where arguably the Ark team can go strike favorable deals from an investment standpoint,” said Joe Percoco, co-founder and co-chief executive of Titan, in an interview.

Titan earlier this month launched real-estate and private credit funds managed by Apollo Global Management Inc. and Carlyle Group for individual investors on its platform. The startup says it has roughly 55,000 clients and more than $750 million in assets under management.",finance,1664351077

I have $8029 left to pay on my car with 22.04% apr. My account reaches maturity on Nov. 24, 2024.  I pay $359 a month currently for my car, and sometimes it feels like I'm not even making a dent in the principal each time I make a payment.

&amp;#x200B;

[Studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) shows that my student loans would have an interest rate of 4.99%. These loans will be broken up for 2 semesters. If i take these loans out, i'll be receiving 4,750 per semester.

I've plugged both loans in a loan calculator.

car (2 years):  
Payment Every Month:      $416.69  
Total of 24 Payments:        $10,000.52  
Total Interest:                      $1,971.52

student loan (10 years):

Total of 120 Payments:      $10,214.49  
Total Interest:                      $2,185.49

&amp;#x200B;

although the interest for the student loan is more because of the amount of time, the monthly payment would really help me out. i find that i am always stretched thin every month with my car loan among my other monthly bills.

i appreciate your thoughts on the matter

Below is the full text of the central bank's statement:

&gt;""This repricing has become more significant  in the past day – and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK  government debt. Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen,  there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would  lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a  reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;""In  line with its financial stability objective, the Bank of England stands  ready to restore market functioning and reduce any risks from contagion  to credit conditions for UK households and businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;""To  achieve this, the Bank will carry out temporary purchases of long-dated  UK government bonds from 28 September. The purpose of these purchases  will be to restore orderly market conditions. The purchases will be  carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome. The  operation will be fully indemnified by HM Treasury.  
&gt;  
&gt;""On  28 September, the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee noted  the risks to UK financial stability from dysfunction in the gilt market.  It recommended that action be taken, and welcomed the Bank’s plans for  temporary and targeted purchases in the gilt market on financial  stability grounds at an urgent pace.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These  purchases will be strictly time limited. They are intended to tackle a  specific problem in the long-dated government bond market. Auctions will  take place from today until 14 October. The purchases will be unwound  in a smooth and orderly fashion once risks to market functioning are  judged to have subsided.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Monetary  Policy Committee has been informed of these temporary and targeted  financial stability operations. This is in line with the Concordat  governing the MPC’s engagement with the Bank’s Executive regarding  balance sheet operations. As set out in the Governor’s statement on  Monday, the MPC will make a full assessment of recent macroeconomic  developments at its next scheduled meeting and act accordingly. The MPC  will not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to  return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in  line with its remit.

personalfinance,Borrow from 401K for car to avoid interest rates????,"Watching interest rates rise and the car prices be what they are at…. I am starting to think this might be a viable option.  Am I wrong?  

Our family is looking at getting a larger car.  I think if we had to hold off we could for maybe 2 years, but the kids are growing and soon will be uncomfortably scrunched up in the back seat, it isn’t going to hold much longer.  I am not sure how much longer the market is going to be messed up.  I looked at lightly used cars… hahaha those prices are funny.  Some were going well over the MSRP of a new car.  The new car prices aren’t spectacular but they are doable but you are placed on a waiting list that sounds like it may last 6 months to a year.  My issue isn’t waiting, my problem is it sounds like I can’t lock in my financing rate now which keeps creeping up.  I really don’t want to pay 6+% for a car.  Someone mentioned borrowing from the 401K which actually sounds like a decent idea because then I would be paying myself back.  We would likely need about $30K for the car total.

More about us:
1. Currently our housing expenses are under 20% of our income post tax… we are definitely not house poor.  We have no other debt.
2. Our 401K is ahead of schedule according to most “guides”… we aren’t doing terrible.

The biggest draw back I see is that if the market goes up I lose the associated gains.  There is also the risk if I lose my job for some reason.  Anything else I am missing?",finance,1664362280

personalfinance,Getting remarried. Financial advice needed,"I have been a commission only commercial real estate broker for 25 years. Here is my current financial situation. I own a house worth about $1.2m with a $400k mortgage. Both my kids are in college. I have fully funded both their educations. My only other debt are solar panels where I owe $20k and am paying $450/month with a 5.99% interest rate. I also have a dog where I pay $300/month for day care. My mortgage and taxes are $4k month with a 4% rate. I probably spend another $4k in general expenses. I have $300k in cash and another $300k in commissions due. I just went through a full IRS audit last monthand need to pay $20k in additional taxes but that’s basically it debt wise. My house is 4500sf and soon I’ll be the only person living there. But I have a really strong emotional attachment to it. I also have about $350k in sep ira investments.

To add to this I am get remarried in the next 3 months to a very wealthy woman who has 2 homes where I now mostly live. To be honest I don’t want to just live in her homes without having my own home. Becoming a fat elderly toyboy isn’t something I relish.

I guess my problem is, is the idea of retirement seems like a joke. I would need maybe $2m at least I calculate.

I think my plan is to work till I can’t and then somehow downgrade to a shack somewhere. I realize I have my future wife’s luxurious abodes but having been divorced before and gone through the ringer I want to stand on my own 2 feet. The idea of having a bolt hole in South America really appeals to me.

personalfinance,FTHB under contract and having MAJOR second thoughts.,"My wife and I (33/35) are under contract for a home for 290k in a different state than we currently reside.  We are both remote workers and we THINK we will like where we are moving to, but since it is a new area to both of us, we can't be sure that will be accurate.  The house checks a good deal of boxes but also is a bit underwhelming in one key aspect, size.  We don't have kids now but might in a year or two and we think we could outgrow the house fairly quickly.  Also being a new area, we might decide we hate it and want to move in 2 years.  With interest rates rising and the economy possibly headed to a recession, it sounds like it is bad financial move to sell a house after only 2 years especially if value has stayed the same or even dropped (seems feasible given the economic conditions).  OR home both home prices and interest rates could continue to rise and we will regret not jumping in when we did. We have a good rate (5.25%) locked in for a few weeks and would hate to miss out on that.  We are also able to put 45k down and PMI would only be $22 a month.  We are just totally sick of renting but maybe it seems it would be best to rent in the new location, see how we like it, and let the economic waters settle a bit. It would just really suck for things to have continued to rise at a steep level. This has been a bit of a ramble.  Seeking some advice/perspective.  
We haven't had it appraised yet but the 4 estimates from Zillow and Realtor.com are 305k, 305k, 281k, 341k.  
FWIW our combined salaries are $167,500 + ~5% bonus (put 28k in 401k/HSA) and have monthly take home pay of ~$8,800 a month.  New state has lower taxes which would results in ~500 more take home a month.",finance,1664366084
economy,"No, Printing Money Isn't (Necessarily) Causing Inflation","There's a particularly poisonous idea championed by Ayn Rand that has seeped into the minds in every corner of Congress and mainstream economics, and I think we need to look at it. Rand says:

&gt; *“Whenever destroyers appear among  men, they start by destroying money, for money is men’s protection and  the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its  owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards  and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of  values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced.  Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed  at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by  legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of  the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked: ‘Account  Overdrawn.’”* 

Most of us think the economic rift  that defines the USA is between “tax-and-spend” liberals and  “cut-and-shrink” conservatives. This rift, though – sown between  gold-standard thinking and fiat thinking – is far more consequential. It  is a rift over what money *is* and what it *should be.* Everybody  should be paying attention to this rift and figuring out how to  understand what’s going on because there aren’t much bigger, more  fundamental issues than this.

If Ayn Rand was right, it’s a big  deal because that means our monetary system – and our way of life – is  destined to collapse by design. If she was wrong, it’s equally a big  deal because her viewpoints would then be highly toxic to the survival  of our monetary system and way of life. It might express itself, for  instance, as Joe Biden’s 40-year push to cut Social Security or Judy  Shelton’s push to go back to the gold standard.

So is Ayn Rand right, or is she wrong?

To  paraphrase, Rand is saying:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Under fiat  currency (such as the USA has now), the government sets the value of  goods instead of these values being set “objectively” (as they were when  the dollar was tied to gold). 
2. Nonconvertible money is created by the government *before there is corollary value* in material terms.
3. The  government is forcing more and more people to accept money that is worth  less and less as it spends more and more – and there will be a breaking  point.
4. The money  has nothing “attached to it” to give it value, so the value is backed by  “a gun” (force-backed guarantee) that that money’s creation will be *justified* by the creation of material wealth. 

Rand opened up an examination of  chartalism/monetarism that is mostly correct in terms of fact, but  disastrously misguided on implication. Hyperinflation in Venezuela,  Zimbabwe, and the Weimar Republic have been erroneously brought forward  as evidence that she is correct and fiat is suicide, and this sort of  thinking in our legislature has vast consequences.

First, we must understand what Rand got **right:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. [Yes, the government ***de facto*** sets the price of goods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNNaxi5ckz8&amp;feature=youtu.be); Rand is right about this. If the government creates the currency and controls the amount of it in circulation, *and* can  buy as much of whatever it likes, the government effectively sets all  prices – not on purpose, but as an indirect consequence of its policy.  The price of goods *forms organically* in response to the government’s practice of buying at market rates to provision itself.
2. Yes, money creation (also known as *federal spending)*  comes prior to wealth creation, which is not unusual. Money is often  paid between a client and contractor before the product is created (a  drive-through line, for illustration). Contractors are usually competing  to get contracts from the government and to do that work, rather than  being forced into it (by “a gun,” of course), but we’ll come back to  that in a moment.
3. Yes,  dollars are becoming worth less and less. There is no question about  this. The consumer price index is proof positive of that – and it’s an  obvious result of a system that targets a 2% inflation rate annually.

Before we get into where Rand was wrong, there are some understandings we must have.

We first have to clear the air about  what inflation is. First, there’s the steady, planned inflation that is  necessary to the forces that maintain the consumer market: demand and  consumption. The Federal Reserve  aims to keep inflation steady annually (this is done for a number of  reasons, including stimulating consumption and preventing[ deflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp)).  This type of planned inflation is part of standard operating procedure  for nearly every country on earth (with the exceptions of Syria, Iran,  and North Korea), and not considered problematic by nearly anyone.

There is a second, distinct type of  inflation that occurs within individual markets (such as the steel  market or the oil market) and is about price fluctuations due to supply  and demand within specific markets. When there is a shortage of steel,  for instance – as arose recently in the US due to Trump’s “trade war”  with China – supply and demand go out of equilibrium in the steel  market, so the *steel market* experiences a kind of inflation distinct from the *steady, planned* inflation designed by the Fed. This type of inflation is called either *cost-push* or *demand-pull* inflation, depending on where the issue arose.

There is also *hyper*inflation,  which is when inflation goes out of control very quickly and thus money  becomes extremely devalued very quickly. Yes, in fact, hyperinflation  does often arise when the amount of currency rises significantly – but  **this is** ***not*** **where  the relevant facts end and correlation doesn’t equal causation**. For  instance, in Weimar Germany (the big ""case study"" anti-fiat folks always seem to turn to), the nation’s productive capacity was decimated by  World War I and the French seizure of the Ruhr Valley. Because Germany  had agreed to pay France an exorbitant sum in reparations per the terms  of the Treaty of Versailles, though, the money production could not stop  *even though* goods  production was ground almost into oblivion. With this in mind, the  smart move from a currency solvency viewpoint would be to *decrease* the money supply, not *increase* it  dramatically – yet Germany was bound by the punitive treaty and had no  choice. In other words, Germany’s supply was disastrously insufficient,  so effectively the hyperinflation had already happened; adding a  gigantic amount of currency only served to worsen the problem. In fact,  hyperinflation has *never* arisen due merely to monetary policy or “printing money.” An examination of Zimbabwe and Venezuela will reveal similar issues.

Yet even this isn’t the whole story.  If it were, then there would be a hard and fast rule that a country’s  “debt-to-GDP ratio” represents a limit to the amount of currency that’s  “out there” before disaster hits. This is clearly not the case – see  Japan – so there must be more to the story.

This leads to the second major point  to consider before examining where Rand went wrong: We have to  understand the difference between stocks and flows. To simplify, a *stock* is a relatively immobile reserve of currency – like a savings account – and a *flow* is  an amount of currency that can deplete or add to a stock. A flow, in  other words, is money that moves (velocity of money is all about flows);  a stock is money that accumulates *from* flows and *stops flowing*. An analogy might be a river as *flow* and a lake as *stock.*

The implication of a proper understanding of stocks and flows is critical: inflationary pressure does not come from *immobile* money, but only from *mobile* money. Therefore, it is not about how much money is “out there” in total – only about how much money is *flowing.* Money  creation that merely adds to stocks is not inflationary, because it  creates no pressure within the market; after all, how could money that  is not creating demand have an effect on supply? 

With this out of the way, we can now examine where Rand was **wrong.**

The first major problem in Rand’s analysis comes from her point that *the  government is forcing more and more people to accept money that is  worth less and less as it spends more and more – and there will be a  breaking point.* Unfortunately for Rand, the breaking point she imagines is actually between *flows* and *goods,* not  a result of the amount of all money “out there” (which, again, includes  stocks). As an illustration, if you are socking away every penny you  get into a savings account, you are not creating demand and thereby not  affecting supply or prices in any way except a minuscule *deflationary* pressure (taking money *out of* circulation). In other words, in order for the mere *amount of money “out there”* to  have a problematic effect, all savings requirements (stocks) would have  to be so full that they spilled over and created too much *flow*  (hence, demand) for supply to ever keep up or price adjustments to  correct for it. It would take outright sabotage for something like this  to be allowed to happen.

The second major problem in Rand’s  analysis comes from her point that our money has nothing “attached to  it” to give it value, so the value is backed by “a gun” (force-backed  guarantee) that that money’s creation will be *justified* by the creation of material wealth. The problems here are twofold: first, money creation (*federal spending*)  usually comes in the form of awarding federal contracts, with the goal  being the creation of actual wealth (tangible goods/services); and  second, labeling this arrangement as “force” in any way is an extreme  mischaracterization of what’s actually happening.

Let’s take a hypothetical situation  to examine this. Let’s say my town wants to build a hydroelectric dam.  They have the raw natural resources to do this and they have the people  that could do the labor, but of course, people charge for their labor –  that’s how it works. The only problem: a hydroelectric dam costs more to  build than the city can afford, *even if* it would save money and pay off in the long run. 

No problem! It is no trouble for the  Federal Reserve to type on their keyboards to mark a debit in a private  sector account and a credit in the federal government’s account – in  other words, to pay/spend/create money to people. The recipients gather  the resources, create the stuff, construct it, and run it. To the  government, it’s nothing; for the city, there is now *access* to *unlock* those goods, turning potential into kinetic. Once this is done, of course, there is more *flow* in  the city, which creates economic pressure to create additional supply  and new businesses open – a food truck here, a new strip mall there, and  so on. More demand catalyzes more supply – a domino effect of  production. That which does not turn into flow turns into stock (which  is a deflationary pressure); prices reach an equilibrium. *Voila –* we  just added a whole lot of money, created a whole lot of new wealth with  it, powered the town, and improved the environmental conditions — and  we didn’t get any meaningful inflationary pressure along the way!

Was the company contracted by the federal government *forced* in any way into this arrangement, or did it *actively compete* for  it? Is federal contract work something taken only reluctantly, or is it  considered a fantastic opportunity? This is important because Rand says  there is “a gun” aimed at the workers. Obviously, we can all agree that  these contracts are [jealously fought over](https://datalab.usaspending.gov/competition-in-contracting/) and considered a holy grail of sorts. So… where’s the gun?

People will almost always work (or accept a contract *to do* work)  before receiving payments, whether or not money must be “justified” by  their work (by way of illustration, this is how almost every restaurant operates). This is not unusual, alarming, or problematic in any way.  Whether the government creates the money before or after the work is  done, it serves the same purpose; and either way, people will be paid to  conduct that work. Rand has got her order of operations correct, in  other words; but to characterize any of this as “force” when it is  treated as “opportunity” is a severe mistake.

If the analysis offered above is fair, we can now identify Ayn Rand’s specific logical fallacies:

First, Ayn Rand has mischaracterized the *reason for* the existence of our chartalist system and imagined a conspiracy to bankrupt us that isn’t there. This is an [**appeal to motive**](https://logfall.wordpress.com/appeal-to-motive/) fallacy that exists in service to an [**appeal to implicit conspiracy**](https://theethicalskeptic.com/tag/ad-hoc-fallacy/) [**strawman** ](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman)fallacy.

Second, Rand has for some reason decided that *government-designed* inflation – designed to hold steady – must “reach a tipping point” where its targeted inflation will become *ir*rational  or suddenly spiral out of control. This is patently absurd; there can  be no motive – not even “looting” (why would you loot something that  will become useless once you loot it?) – to cause this or allow it to  happen. Certainly money creation *can* be  inflationary, if it creates dramatic shocks to a market’s supply and  demand; drinking too much water can poison you, but that doesn’t mean  you should therefore never drink any. This conspiracy-oriented thinking  can make our system sound insidious, but any sincere examination can lay  bare the truth: no matter how “woke” something sounds, in this  “disinformation age” nothing should be accepted at face value –  especially something as profoundly consequential as *what money is.*

For those against fiat, this is an important message – it’s one of the primary  reasons I no longer count myself among you, and a vantage point that  answered many of my most pressing anti-fiat questions (*What* is debt? *Why* are we in debt? *Who exactly* is in debt, and to *whom* exactly? If the whole planet is in debt, who do we owe it to – Jupiter?).

For US progressives, this is also an  important message – because if we cannot offer a response to the budget  hawks, we will never, ever have any of the things we desperately want –  no Green New Deals, no universal healthcare, no tuition-free colleges, *nothing.*

It’s time to switch the narrative and do the work that will *allow us* to achieve what we keep demanding.",finance,1664366222
vet,I think my chicken is sick :( please help if you can,I need some help... yesterday morning I got up and went to feed my flock of chickens like every morning and they all coming running over to me! Yet this time I noticed one of my hens didn't... this is very strange. She just sat under a tree and wouldn't come eat with the rest which is behaviour she has never done. I went over to her and she got up and would run away from me but once I left went back to sitting under the tree fluffed... I ended up getting a net and catching her. I was worried maybe she was egg bound so I gave her a warm Epsom salt bath and put her in a quite room. For a few hours she was walking round but wouldn't eat or drink still... that arvo i ended up putting her back in the pen and she jumped up on the roost with the rest. This morning I went out to check on her and she was under the tree and wouldn't come to food still... she was fluffed and hunched with her tail closer to the ground but if I go near her she walks away. I decided to leave her for the day to monitor her and she didn't seem to move from the tree... and night fall has come I went to check and she is on the roost with the rest... I don't think she's eaten in 24 hours I'm worried and I'm not sure what it would be.... any suggestions would be appreciated but please no mean comments.... we don't have a vet close by that specialises in chickens/birds.

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Wednesday as traders struggle to find their footing after the S&amp;P 500 notched a fresh bear market low in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 57 points, or about 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid about 0.9%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Apple were down nearly 4% in premarket trading after a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, said the tech company is ditching plans to increase new iPhone production after demand fell short of expectations.
*****
&gt; Stock futures pared earlier losses after the Bank of England said it would temporarily purchase long-dated UK government bonds in an effort to stabilize the plunging British pound. Sterling briefly popped on the news before trading 0.5% lower against the dollar at $1.0647.
*****
&gt; The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield gave back its initial gains after the announcement, last trading at about 3.93%. Earlier in the trading session, the benchmark rate broke above 4% for the first time since 2008.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed session in which the S&amp;P 500 reached a new bear market low of 3,623.29 and posted its sixth straight day of losses, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a gain.
*****
&gt; Several technical metrics show that the stock market may be oversold, but some on Wall Street are worried that investors have not priced in an earnings slowdown and the impact of the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes. The S&amp;P 500 breaking below its previous low is a key indicator for some that stocks still have further to fall.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re certainly not at the end of the road in terms of pricing in the full recessionary outcome. … We really need to get to dirt cheap valuations on equities, and we’re not quite there yet,” Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, said on Tuesday’s “Closing Bell.”

Long long Round Table discussion with the Chicago Federal Reserve chief discussing inflation targets and federal funds projections through 2022 and projections through 2023. Takeaways are that a 2% on average inflation rate is desirable and that the Chicago fed Chief supports this. His prediction for federal funds rates are to be to 4.0 - 4.25 by the end of 2022. And 4.6 by the end of 2023. When asked about pain to emerging market economies and other manufacturing economies that depend on a less expensive dollar the concerns seemed to be received with less concern. It seems like the primary focus of this individual and his policies would be strictly to take the US economy as its own ecosystem without considering external outputs / inputs.",finance,1664369090
personalfinance,Questions regarding Series I Savings Bond,"I have a few questions regarding the Series I Savings Bond that I can't seem to find on their website. I'm looking to invest in these and potentially be adding more each year (depending on how the rates go). 

I understand that you must hold them for 5 years since the date of purchase or have a 3 month interest penalty.

* What happens if I keep buying each calendar year, do I have to wait an additional year to withdraw that additional amount, or are the 5 years counted since the initial purchase?
* The website says the interest rate is locked in for the next 6 months at the current rate. What happens if you buy the bond a month before the rate changes? Do you get 6 months of the current rate and then 6 months on the next or does the rate change back for the newest one and actualize accordingly? As in, say I buy my bond 1 month before the rate changes, so I would get 6 months guaranteed at the current rate, and then 5 months with the next rate, or do I get 6 months guaranteed for each interest rate change?

I am looking to buy $10,000 now and next year another $10,000, basically maxing out contributions if possible.",finance,1664369557

I’ve been wanting to buy a home for a very long time now I recently got approved first they gave me an amount, and my realtor was kind of a dick so I decided to go with another realtor. When I reach out to lender he tells me because of interest rates and everything going on with the oncoming recession my approval is still on but has decreased 25k. He says he can either give me that letter but with less money or we can wait it out. Well my car is at the point of breaking down anyway but I’ve been putting it off because I wanted to buy my home so bad I was willing to take a the bus if necessary . But now I’m thinking if I can’t get the home for now anyways shouldn’t I upgrade my car ? I just worry that later after I get my car once they try pre approving me again it either won’t or it’ll be even lower since I would have a car loan (my current car is paid off ).but it’s not even a want at the point I need to get rid of my car before it leaves me stranded and I can’t get the home so can I get a newer car ? Has anyoneu else does this before and how does it affect you having a car loan and then trying to get a house ? Please any advice is welcome and very needed !

btc,Emulating OP_BLOCKHEIGHT using OP_OUTPOINTTXHASH (or SegWit). American style contracts may be possible.,"It should be possible to emulate `OP_BLOCKHEIGHT` using `OP_OUTPOINTTXHASH`. A price Oracle could sign the price of an asset (e.g. gold), along with the block-height (or timestamp) &amp; (shortened) **TXID of the Contract**. The initial prices can be encoded in the Contract itself. If a new block is found &amp; the price changes by more than 0.005%, the Oracle broadcasts a change in the Contract's TXID, ideally without changing its P2SH address. The Oracle signs nothing if they can't broadcast a change in TXID, or else an old price could be used later on. This way we may not need an OpCode for block-height.

Shortening the TXID to **20B** could reduce data-usage (32B shouldn't be necessary). `&lt;20&gt; OP_SPLIT OP_DROP` seems sufficient (first or last 20B of TXID), but `OP_SHA1` is 3 Bytes less. Instead of repeating it 5 times to verify 5of8 data-sig-messages, it can be `OP_DUP`'d in Script.

SegWit could work in a similar way. Both counterparties predict like a hundred (or thousand) changes in the Contract's TXID, at various sat/B. SegWit can enforce a covenant by brute forcing every possibility. Then the Oracle can change the TXID predictably. There'd also be a 5-week (or 8-week) timeout-clawback which is pre-signed 2of2, following any chain of TXID changes. It's conceivable to use SegWit for Hedging, instead of OP\_CTV (`OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`). Instead of just signing the asset price, the Oracle (e.g. mining pool) could form part of a 2of3 (or 5of8) escrow service, based on `OP_RETURN` Hedge contracts (e.g. 10x Hedge to gold, paying 2%/month on 10\*Principal, with 0.1%&amp;0.1% Open&amp;Close fees). Arguably the `OP_RETURN` scheme could be best, since the monthly interest rates could be lowest for BTC-Hedging, to the point where txn fees could rise dramatically if it's popular. A Coin which is a Store-of-Value ought to have the best rates. Mining pools could compete on offering Smart-Oracle escrow services if miners demand `OP_RETURN` smart contracts, to cater to Hedge Funds.

The `&lt;M&gt;` &amp; `&lt;N&gt;` in MofN MultiSig can be blinded &amp; kept **secret** if both counterparties cooperatively Exit. I doubt TapRoot would help.

u/bitcoincashautist [mentioned](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/op-get-current-block-height/533/12) there could be a clock covenant, over at BitcoinCashResearch. However the approach I'm describing doesn't necessarily involve OP\_CLTV (except for a 5-week **clawback**).

One issue with the emulation concept is it could conceivably be ""aiding &amp; abetting money laundering"" if a well-known Smart-Oracle uses their only PubKey to repeatedly sign the price of gold along with North-Korean TXIDs. One idea is to sign a separate (clock-like) dummy Contract TXID, which may be [invoked](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w11r7s/emulating_op_eval_using_bitcoin_cash_native/) using `OP_UTXOBYTECODE`. If all contracts use dummies, it might simplify the Scripts. `OP_BLOCKHEIGHT` looks simpler &amp; cleaner, where the Oracle can just publicly sign a price every 10 minutes without bothering with any TXIDs or covenants. However invoking `OP_BLOCKHEIGHT` can't be [dsproof protected](https://reference.cash/protocol/network/messages/dsproof-beta) (many confirmations may be required for all subsequent payments in a chain).

Oracles might use 5 minute **moving average**s, since on-chain Hedging could cause price manipulation at Centralized Exchanges, but not necessarily for 5 whole minutes.

American-style &amp; European-style Hedging is different because with the latter the Hedge can't Exit before maturity (set maturity only). If Hedges need to be able to Exit whenever they want, the Oracles can sign prices along with TXIDs which change as the block-height changes. It'd cost less to Exit sooner, since the effective **premium** should go up with block-height.

One potential issue with using 5of8 price feeds is that the Hedge could Exit using 5 prices which are slightly in their favor, conceivably at 100x leverage. **10x** leverage is safer than 1x, since only 10% as much money need be risked (similar to a 10% stop-loss).

A P2SH **Script** for a 5of8 escrow could look like:

    2of2              (Cooperative Exit)
    1of2+5of8         (Smart-Oracles judge dispute)
    2of2+1of8+Return  (Smart-Oracle changes TXID of contract)
    2of2+Timeout      (5 week clawback)

The Hedge might always pay the txn fees of TXID changes. The Oracles involved could form part of a **Smart-Validator-Network**. Like how smartBCH has validators, the `OP_RETURN` contracts in BTC could have validators, too.

**Edit**: BCH can't handle compound interest (`OP_EXP`), whereas BTC `OP_RETURN` contracts could handle that.  
One perspective is that the P2SH, P2WSH or P2TR unlocking Script is like the **Bailiff** in Court, whereas the `OP_RETURN` script is the **Judges**. The judges are capable of higher level logic. It's like ""layer-1.5"", somewhere btwn layers 1 &amp; 2 (if layer 2 is RSK or Blockstream's Liquid, then using nothing but an `OP_RETURN` is different).",cryptocurrency,1664371203
CryptoCurrency,"In court brief, Musk says the SEC is unlawfully muzzling him","Elon Musk has some crazy tweets and some tweets that have had a large impact on the crypto market. The crazy thing is that all of his tweets, even those that do not deal directly with Tesla, have to be approved by an attorney. Apparently, Elon Musk does not follow that rule 100% of the time or so the SEC thinks due to some tweets he made about a year ago.

He is now saying in a court document filed with the federal appeals court in Manhattan that the [SEC is muzzling him](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-securities-fraud-907c2915c0484aee8643ada35689938f). 

&gt; The brief says that a provision in the settlement requiring Musk to get prior approval before tweeting about the electric car company is an illegal “government-imposed muzzle on Mr. Musk’s speech before it is made.” The settlement required that his tweets be approved by a Tesla attorney before being published. The SEC is investigating whether Musk violated the settlement with tweets last November asking Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock.

He has previously unsuccessfully tried to get the settlement that he made with the SEC thrown out by a U.S. District Judge in New York, but was utterly unsuccessful at that. 

I wonder what he is trying to post that his attorneys are not allowing him to post or if this is just posturing due to his tweeting last year. I would not want to be the attorney in charge of reviewing Elon Musk’s tweets, that is for sure. 

I want to think that crypto is mature enough that a random businessman that likes dog coins and coins named after him does not hold enough power to alter a giant market just by a random shower thought tweet. Unfortunately, I do not think that is the case right now. Right now, the stock market is influenced by mainly government officials comments. Since there is not a government that controls crypto, it could be that there will always be a few people throughout the world that have the power to cause a change in the crypto market based off of a public comment. 

All I know is that Elon Musk is pissed that he has to have his tweets reviewed by a lawyer before they get posted. He also is probably pissed that he is being investigated by the SEC again, but that is a different story. His tweets have not had a huge impact on the market lately and  I personally think that is great. It could be that in a bear market people care less that China is thinking about banning crypto for the 11th time and that Elon Musk thinks that he is the president of DOGE and plans on taking it to Mars with him. 

At least we get some comedy in the midst of this bear market of seeing Elon Musk try to grapple with the SEC and get a settlement that he agreed with overthrown. The one thing that I know is that if he does get unmuzzled there will be some very amusing tweets to follow.",cryptocurrency,1664371445

CryptoCurrency,!!!UPDATE!!! - My journey into Crypto,"LDR: **Total PNL** \-37.29%|Holdings: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, DOGE, XRP, LUNC, LUNA

Sentiment: Bearish. DXY still high, FED not pivoting and global politics still not stable. 

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

\- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.

\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)

\- ADJUSTMENT-

I have started to buy the dip a bit more aggressively. As we come deeper in the Bear market I decided it was time to push my average cost down a bit more. Also once I have started to buy a coin in the top five I keep DCA into it. I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.

Now to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now

So to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.

UPDATE

Must admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\* plan!!!

I have adjusted my strategy a bit. I am upping my investment in BTC and ETH compared to alts.

UPDATE 19-9-2022

Heavy on BTC and ETH.

UPDATE 28-9-2022

Implement flexible DCA day and time. When pump postpone DCA in bear market.

I graduated from an M.A. program in June, and will be attending a PhD program starting next August (I already have a deferred offer, and will be re-applying to even more schools). My repayment period for my federal student loans will begin in December. Is there a way to make it so it simply does not begin until I get out of my PhD? Or will I have to pay my monthly fees until I am actually in school? I am unsure and clarity on this will be of great help in planning ahead. I am happy to say that I am only 10,000$ away in assets from the goal of paying off these loans in full, but I'd much prefer to put that off until I am out of school --especially so my investments can grow in the meantime without interference from liquidation. If I have to pay fees monthly until August, I'm prepared for that. But if I have to grind to make that next 10,000, I am also prepared for that! It's just that I cannot see which is more likely to be the case --I don't consider myself knowledgable in any deep sense about personal finances, but I've seen the damage debt can do from watching my Dad in credit card debt (I've never missed a 'current balance' payment on my credit card!)

I was 20 with minimal credit history and only had my license for about a week. I have $15,842 left on my loan.

Now I'm looking into refinancing as I have built credit and have some history consistently paying my loan. I currently have an offer of 4.24% interest with a minimum monthly payment of $230 for another 65 months. I know this length of time may make it seem not worth it, but my plan is to go above the minimum when I can and pay it off well before then. 

The reason I am also looking into refinancing is that I am trying to save more money and reduce my monthly expenses where I can. While I want to pay above my monthly minimum as much as I can so less of that money goes to interest, I also am working less hours to attend school full time and I fund my schooling as well. This means there will be times when it's helpful for me to have a lower monthly minimum. In november I'll be making more $ that can go towards my car.

defi,What's wrong with crypto loan platforms?,"I am a smart investor. I bought bitcoin at 55 and keep it to sell for more. I can use my bitcoin as collateral if I need money and borrow stablecoins. When bitcoin is 100, I can easily pay off my debts. Modern platforms for crypto loans have no problems with that.

But what if I'm not that smart an investor? I bought some poocoins, could not fix the loss and now they are just gathering dust in my wallet. I cannot use them as collateral, these tokens are not supported by crypto lending platforms. And there is a problem with that. 

And what if I'm the smartest investor and I only have stablecoins? The market is going to hell, it would seem that this is the perfect chance to make money. I have 2 options here, either spend stables to buy altcoins or use them as collateral and get the tokens I need for my manipulations. But the problem is that crypto lending platforms cannot lend me poocoins, which I believe in hard pumping. They only have boring bitcoin, ether, and even at best a couple of strong altcoins.

The second and third cases show that the currently dominant platforms such as Compound are able to satisfy a very limited number of requests. If you want to lend your altcoins or speculate on them without buying them, then they are not suitable. 

This is why I believe young startups in this industry are breathing down the backs of giants. More flexible platforms are able to solve more user cases, providing more opportunities for earning. An example is [Qoda Finance](https://qoda.fi/). The team builds the protocol according to the marketplace model, not AMM.

Prospective adoptive parent here. Child was born in Dec. 2021 and placed with my family at birth at hospital. Our adoption agency’s timeline was that we’d be finalized in a couple months. April 2022 comes around and we aren’t finalized so adoption agency recommends we file extension to Oct 2022 on 2021 tax return since we don’t have a SSN for child yet. 

We have still not finalized adoption yet due to backlog in court not getting to us yet. Neither here nor there, that’s not what I’m worried about. But it means we still don’t have a SSN. 

We have just applied for the ATIN (adoption tax identification number) but the IRS website indicates that can take up to 8 weeks to have one assigned. October 15th deadline for tax return extension is less than 8 weeks away. 

I am looking for guidance on what to do at this point? Do I just miss the Oct. 15 deadline and file late when I get that ATIN assigned? Is there another extension that can be requested? I can’t file without putting in a SSN or ATIN so I don’t see filing without a number as an option. Any guidance appreciated.",finance,1664391504

My dilemma now is what should I do with the money? I know I can pay the lump sum to the principal of the mortgage which would mean I would not pay interest on 30k USD over the course of the 30 year mortgage (I got my house last year). This sounds good on paper however my interest rate on the mortgage is 2.75% and I thought I could maybe invest the money elsewhere, which would lead me to a much better yield and thus even if I had to pay the interest the profits from the investment would offset this.

personalfinance,I need ~50-75k 0% interest free loan / aka 0% APR Credit Card!,"Hi Guys,

Edit: I am From Australia (downundaahhh!)

As you may or may not know construction/material costs for building have increased significantly, in some areas/selections as much as 30-40%! (opportunistic greed!).

I need around \~50-75k in funding to finish building my house the way I had originally intended it to be as my building contract is fixed-price in line with my construction loan, however some areas of the house have allowances for selections and due to price hikes I am effectively getting less for more $$...

To combat this I am happy to blow another \~50-75k into the house considering I plan to live in it for a very long time, dream home blah blah, save me your lecture on over-capitalisation and let me just blow it on materialistic shit! yolo.

I don't think I can ask my bank to top-up my construction loan for a few reasons like, I am already at my max home loan borrowing capacity (at the time I applied beginning 2021), they will probably question why I am spending more and reject it, but even if they did approve it my interest rates are now variable \~4.5% due to the recent RBA cash rate increase pushing rates up - and more to come!

I applied for and was approved for $50k easily for a personal loan through some random lender, but they want a RIDICULOUS 10.99% fixed rate for 5-7 years term + $575 establishment fee, is this good deal or simply highway robbery? I am not accepting it, they lured me in with advertising rates from 6.14%, but then hit me with 10.99% AFTER I applied and my credit score now takes a hit! my score was very good to excellent before enquiring for this loan.

What I want to know is can I essentially get a ""personal loan"" for the needed \~50-75k using a 0% APR Credit Card!

Citibank AU are currently offering the Citi Clear credit card with an introductory rate of 0% on balance transfers for the first 36 months! and then there is also the Citi Ready Credit (Personal Loan) but with 3.99% introductory offer on balance transfer for 36 months.

I have never used these features, reading the PDS I assume I apply, get approved, and I can simply transfer out up to 80% of my credit limit to another Australian bank account under my name, and spend that cash on whatever I so please?

Effectively, getting a interest free loan???? provided I pay it all back within 3 years (minus the measly annual membership card fees).

Need your sound financial advice to advise me if there are any holes or pitfalls in my idea, or if I am doing something stupid here?

Is this a slam dunk as long as I am disciplined and make the minimum monthly repayments? any advice or tips, alternative options ?",finance,1664395239

Over the pandemic I have accumulated credit card debt. Some of my cards have 28% interest rate and it’s making payments difficult. I spend around $800/Month on payments. 
I’ve tried to receive personal loans and have some luck.. but the rates are around 25%-33% APR. it’s would save me maybe $50 a month on payments. And the interest rate is approx. 3% difference. 
My credit is not great (647)…I can’t get a decent loan or debt transfer bank card. 
I have tried to negotiate with banks, but they don’t budge. I explain I’ve never been late and a long time customer… no luck with lowering the interest. 

I have cut down all subscriptions, I don’t eat out, I barely spend unless it’s necessary. It’s tough just being home all the time because to go do things.. it costs money. Inflation has definitely hurt as well. 

I know debt settling isn’t a good option… but I’m almost at that point.

CryptoCurrency,Guide To Protecting Your Crypto,"A lot of scams are ongoing in cryptoland and I wanted to share some ways to ensure you don’t become a victim and go about your life worry-free.




It is more likely you will be indiscreetly scammed than your account will be hacked. Most the time, nothing can be undone if your funds are withdrawn out of your wallet. Therefore, the onus is on you to protect your investments. 



Here is a list of things I currently implement. If you think this is going overboard, don’t invest in crypto. You run a high risk of being another statistic in this sub posting something like “I was hacked and my funds are gone”. 



**Use a fresh email address for every wallet and exchange account you open**


Mitigate the risk of your email being compromised. If a scammer, hacker, malware, whatever compromises your email, don’t let that be the endgame for everything you do and own. Putting all your eggs in one basket isn’t smart. Do not use the email you opened up 8 years ago, extensively used it for your entire online life, and shared its existence with thousands of websites. Data breaches occur all the time. The fewer links to your crypto accounts, the better. Enable 2FA. Use Gmail Advanced Protection Program if you require it. 



**Use strong passwords coupled with 2FA**

If your password is “hornymonkey” go and change it. Use lower and uppercase letters, numbers, and characters. Eg. “69*^%HorNYm0nk3y#*” Write all your passwords down. Don’t use the same password as social media accounts. Fucking everybody is selling your data. For the love of God, don’t use the same password on everything you own! Every account password should be unique.



2FA stands for 2 Factor Authentication. It is a one-time, time sensitive code that is sent to you when logging in. Do **NOT** use SMS or email 2FA. Your email can be compromised, your number can be spoofed. Buy a Yubikey. Use a second Yubikey as a back up. Research what a Yubikey is. Don’t be cheap.



**Bookmark legit websites**


Pishing links download malware on your device. Don’t click on 3rd party links, scam emails, or anything asking you to enter your account login or seed phrase.



**Use a dedicated computer**


If you can’t afford this, then create a dedicated user account. 




**Buy the best antivirus you can afford**


Bitdefender antivirus is an industry leader. (EDIT: Removed ~~Norton~~ this sub seems to really hate it). It is one of the best for malware detection. Couple this with a VPN. I researched this a lot, other companies just don’t have a high enough virus and malware detection rate.



**Think twice about using your phone as your crypto wallet**


A ton of accounts being drained are through hot wallets on phones. This could be due to phishing links, honeypot websites, public wifi, or some porn website. Use a cold wallet instead. I only use Metamask temporarily, or couple it with Ledger for staking.



**Buy a Ledger or Trezor cold wallet**


We have all heard the phrase “Not your keys, not your coins”.  If you are serious about security, this is extremely important. Exchanges can go insolvent in bear markets, or get hacked. Even if your computer is somehow compromised, a hardware wallet will keep your crypto safe. Unless you forget or share your seedphrase, your coins won’t be lost/stolen.



**Write down passwords and your seedphrase**



Don’t type your passwords in Notes on your phone. Don’t take a picture of your seedphrase. No digital copies of these things should exist anywhere.




**Do test transactions before sending 100% of your coins** 


Send small test transactions first. This ensures you don’t have active malware auto-entering a scammer’s address instead of your own.




Feel free to add or share more. Do as many of these as your budget allows. Obviously if you are investing $20, then utilise everything that is free.",cryptocurrency,1664397468

cybersecurity,A Senior guy rambles on about identity,"This started as a response to a very common question, should I change my password (tl;dr is yes, you should) and turned into a short rambling thing about identity.

Proving identity is about confirming a subject is who they claim to be. This is different from authorization (what can you do if you prove your identity) which isn't going to be covered here. This work is specifically about proving identity in the context of a digital system.

I should add a word about identity and access management (IAM). This is a big and growing area of the security business but one I've only been indirectly involved in. You can spend a lot of money (some of them, a very large amount of money!) getting a complicated system from someone who may or may not know what they're doing. It's also an area that has undergone radical changes in the last few years. In any event, IAM as a discipline or tool set is beyond what I plan to cover here, this essay won't get anywhere near that deep.

So, how do you prove someone is who they claim to be? Traditionally, for digital systems the view is that there are three specific things that can prove identity:

    1. Something you know, 
    2. Something you have, and 
    3. Something you are. 

The process is that a person would present 1 or more (multi-factor/MFA or two-factor/2FA) of these with an asserted identity. The system then checks and says yes or no. So what are they, how do they work and what should an aspiring security professional know about them?

The discussion is best started with #3 as the shortest to cover. It is a reference to biometrics. I'll assume most readers are at least familiar with the idea of finger-print or retina scanners, voice-print systems, etc. All of those are examples of biometrics. More generally, a biometric system consists of a sensor that reads some physical characteristic of the person claiming an identity, some method to digitize it then a mechanism that validates it as correct (or not) for the identity.

Sensors have come a long way since the first generation of finger-print sensors that could be spoofed with a photocopy of the correct fingerprint. They do, though, still have some weaknesses to think about. Most systems, for example, don't directly use the biometric data itself, but rather a digital representation that is usually significantly simplified and in many ways acts similarly to a certificate. Exploiting this might be similar to attacking a hash using collisions, for example, where you simply find a false positive and off you go. The more individual elements of the underlying biometric data incorporated into the digital representation the more difficult finding an arrangement that produces the correct result will be, so maybe not always the easiest attack method. It might also be possible to capture/re-inject the required data into a system to allow requested access through other than the expected path (in other words insert an ethernet device in the line, or hijack the I2C link, or clip onto the jtag interface, hijack a wifi session, ...) Those of you that unlock your phone with your fingerprint or face are also using biometrics. It might (or not) be possible to intercept the biometric data with malware for future use as one possible attack vector. As well, the underlying data link might be a useful target.

I can't add a lot more to the topic of biometrics since they're not really a feature of my life these days. They're a technology and tool like any others and at that level not hard to understand or fit into a security program. Such devices also act in a physical sense to reduce opportunistic tampering, much in the way a visible lock, even a really bad one, will discourage anyone who doesn't have a reason from trying to enter. I wouldn't rely on this, but if you're not an obvious target, such things don't hurt. If you are an obvious target, be aware of such systems providing a false sense of security.

The second factor is something you have. Traditionally this would be a physical device (hardware dongle or similar) or codebook. More recently digital tokens are starting to become common. It's important not to mistake a secondary SMS as fitting this category. The important element of a token is that it can't be separated from the key it provides. SMS doesn't meet this requirement as it's not that hard (look up SS7 security, SIM cloning and hijacking, shoulder surfing, etc.) to get at the data without having the phone it was intended for. An SMS is very much closer to a time-constrained second password. That said, it's better than using only a normal password, it's just not a second factor (it's the same factor twice, which is a different thing). You could (as I do) have a digital token installed on your phone rather than keep track of a USB dongle, Google Authenticator is an example. There is (presumably) no way to get the key generated by the token without my phone so it actually is different from SMS and is in fact a token.

Less commonly today, physical grid cards and code books can be used in this space. There's a risk of a digital copy being made of the codebook or grid card which can lead to compromise and as physical things they can be lost or stolen. In modern use it's common to see a lack of operational security awareness from the people grid cards and code books get issued to as it tends to be the less-technologically engaged groups who need a non-digital second factor. If you have these things in use in your environment, awareness and training are probably your most imporant response to the issue of humans being human.

Used correctly and not otherwise compromised (bad implementation, copied grid cards, etc.) this factor can be very hard to get around. That's not to say such systems haven't been compromised, but it's usually not the token that failed. A growing trend is social-engineering or straight hacking to get the target to provide the correct second factor response as a way to get around the need for the token.

That brings us to the big piece, the ""something you know"", passwords. This is the one thing everybody relies on to some degree. The first consideration is that a password has the same value as the data it protects and should be treated that way. I don't think I'd cry too long if someone hijacks my reddit acount and steals my fake Internet points, but my reaction would be very different if my bank account was compromised (which is a strong argument for 2FA/MFA on such accounts). Therefore, I should have a different level of focus on each. Another key consideration for passwords is that they are a rarely acknowledged example of security through obscurity. A password is only effective at proving your identity if only you know it. This becomes a serious concern if someone gets your password without your knowledge. Which is why (see the top) the correct answer to the question of whether or not you should change your password is yes if you have any reason at all to ask the question (let alone if you suspect it's been compromised). The worst time to find out someone got your password is when they take over your account. This same issue is why it is so important to never use the same password for more than one system. It eliminates risk from other (potentially less defended) systems being compromised leading to a breach in an important system and allows you to save better passwords for more important things. Depending on what it's for, there's no problem with leaving a good password unchanged for a long time. I generally recommend, though, that passwords for bank accounts and primary email should be changed regularly, at least a couple times each year and certainly if you see anything suspicious at all. Remember, changing a password is really easy and quick, recovering an account (and anything that account controlled) is a major pain and never easy. This is helped by a reasonable password management solution, which we will get to.

So what is a good password. XKCD covers this quite well, but I think a bit of additional writing can help. Lots of folk talk about entropy with very fuzzy ideas of what that might be. In the context of a password hash, entropy is a representation of all the different combinations of characters that could have created the hashed value you're looking at. If your password hash is derived from a string limited to only lower case alphabetic and 5 characters length there is much less entropy (fewer possible combinations of all the things available) than if you have upper and lower case, alphabetic and numeric and special characters, etc and 15 characters long. This also tells you that passwords with a certain ""profile"", that is those that are selected using a common sequence of upper case, lower case, alphabetic, numeric, etc are less secure (more guessable, less entropy) than ones where the sequence (of character types) or profile is random or at least unpredictable. That doesn't mean password approaches that use a common pattern are necessarily bad, just that you need to be aware that they might not be as good as you might want or need.

Managing passwords can be a problem for many as well. There is nothing wrong with a decent password manager and it is a common recommendation. It's very important to understand how whichever one you choose actually works (where are your passwords actually stored, how are keys managed, what is persistent in memory, etc.) if you want to understand the actual risk. It's also worth noting as I mentioned above, the value of a password is in what it protects. That means the password for your manager is the most valuable one you have. A passphrase is best, but see the previously mentioned XKCD.

More old school is the notebook in a desk routine. Assuming you're at low risk for bad-guys breaking into your house in preparation for a hacking attack against you or your employer, this is also a pretty reasonable solution. It's also a bit helpful for us older folks if the partner needs to find passwords after something has happened. Don't (I can't stress this enough) put passwords on yellow sticky-notes attached to the monitor, especially if you let TV crews into your office for interviews. Also, a generic text file is a very poor substitute for a password manager though not completely horrible if it lives only on an external storage device (USB key) that is not usually attached. I wouldn't do that or recommend it, but it probably has a place in the tool box for some people.

There are some who take changing passwords to a new level and have a new password for every login. They simply choose a long complex password they never have to remember for each login and simply use the forgot my password/password reset feature next time. This might sound like a good idea but it has some risks. Clearly, this can't be used for your primary email account. That effectively makes your email password your global account password. As well, if you lose your email, you immediately lose access to everything, which would not happen with a standard approach to passwords. This can also hide signs of a compromised account, as one indicator of a problem is a password reset request that wasn't initiated by you. If your in-box is full of password reset requests, there's a good chance you'd never see the one triggered by bad guys. It's another of those things I generally wouldn't do, but you get to make your own decisions. As always in this business, you have to decide if this is OK for you as you're the one who will bear the consequences of that choice.

The last thing I want to mention is closely tied to password management. A lot of bad guys have noticed a tendency to overshare on social media, including answers to account recovery questions. These function like a password, in that the answers are expected to be known by you and no one else. Unfortunately, a lot of the questions are reality based (your dog's name, your high school, whatever) and also the kinds of details that turn up in social media feeds. If an attacker can get to an account recovery mechanism that asks questions he has the answers to, that account is compromised. A more secure approach to account recovery is a second or recovery account, which is the standard for much of the digital industry these days. Account recovery questions are not quite as bad as storing passwords in plain text, but if I see it on an account I consider important, I'm likely to look for a new provider of whatever service is involved.

Proving identity in a digital context is not that different from doing so in a physical context (driver's license is something you have, a picture is a biometric check, etc) but it does come with some additional risks. The biggest is that these are, in the end, complex systems that can have errors in implementation or execution or any of a variety of other vulnerabilities. Other than awareness and operational security training, all we can do is stack elements of a solution (for example MFA) and hope that they are each independant enough to not fail as a collective at the worst possible time.",technology,1664409723

stocks,The Coming Crisis - an update for those it may concern.,"\[***TL;DR*** *- This all should have been obvious because complex adaptive systems like the economy always break down, just like in 2008.  It was not obvious because we understand the economy through a flawed framework.\]*

Hi folks,

About a year ago I wrote this piece called [The Coming Crisis](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oy57s2/the_coming_crisis/) which got a big response (both positive and negative) here in r/stocks.  I was encouraged by user /u/cristhm to make a follow-up, so here goes.  It's late right now so I'll try to make this relatively concise while still hitting all the major points.

In short, most of what I said then and what I'm saying now can be summed up by economist William White in this video:

Look up **""William White - Conducting monetary policy in a complex adaptive system"".**  I can't post YouTube links here.

Don't worry, the talk itself is only about an hour and well worth it.  I found the questions at the end to be interesting, too, but the important part is only the first hour.

**Summary of Mr. White's talk:**

The economy is not linear (the traditional model used by economists), but rather a complex adaptive system.  Think of it like a garden.  You plant the seeds, and you can water it and stuff, but you never really know what's going to happen.  There can be a flood.  A snake can get in.  There can be an invasive species.  Weeds pop up here, flowers die there, etc. The system is too complex for you to entirely understand, because there's too many variables, and not only that, but each one of those variables interacts with the others and has the ability to adapt given changing conditions.  Forgive me if I didn't explain it 100%, I haven't read any work on complex adaptive systems myself and simply try to paraphrase Mr. White.

An example I love to use is the book / film *Jurassic Park.*  The idea was that the owners had the whole park under control, what with security fences and cameras and the dinosaurs not being able to breed or survive without a special food from the handlers for more than 3 days.  But the system was complex and adaptive, so somehow the dinosaurs found a way to escape and to procreate and survive on their own.  If you think about it, it makes total sense. Obviously bringing back extinct dinosaurs from the dead and making a theme park was a horrible idea.  But it really goes to illustrate the folly of trying to ""play God"".

*Jurassic Park* is a great illustration of how complex adaptive systems are unstable and tend to break down.  Another example of breakdown in these systems would be the ecosystem which included the dinosaurs (Michael Crichton wrote about this in the sequel, *The Lost World).*  

How does this relate to markets / the economy?  It's because, as I said, financial markets and the economy are complex adaptive systems, and the issue is that we haven't been treating them as such.  For decades people at the Fed and central banks have assumed that as long as prices are stable then we need not worry about macro stability.  William White argues that this is a grave mistake.  There are other issues, including asset price bubbles and rising debt stocks.  In fact, this was the entire cause of 2008.  William White wrote about this in 2006, 2 years before the crisis hit in full force:

[Is price stability enough?](https://www.bis.org/publ/work205.pdf)

Here's a quote from that paper:

*""Following on these arguments, an altered framework for conducting monetary policy would demonstrate more symmetry over the credit cycle. There would be greater resistance to upswings. This, in turn, would obviate the need for asymmetric easing in the subsequent downturn and the problems arising from holding policy rates at very low levels for sustained periods. One important effect of more symmetric policies is that they would also act to prevent financial imbalances from cumulating over time. This, in turn, would free the authorities’ hands to respond appropriately to the upward phase of any given credit cycle, since there would be less fear of precipitating a crisis. In this way, a virtuous rather than a vicious circle might be more firmly established.""*

He ends with a statement that was eerily prophetic for the year 2006:

*""One hopes that it will not require a disorderly unwinding of current excesses to prove convincingly that we have indeed been on a dangerous path.""*

It's a statement that, in my view, applies just as much today as it did in 2006.

He also wrote something that applies very much to the situation we are facing now:

*""On the other hand, the Japanese reliance on “quantitative easing”, in addition to very low interest rates, highlights a further complication as monetary authorities begin to tighten. Economic agents more generally will be aware of the extent to which banks have reserves well in excess of normal requirements, and could become increasingly concerned about their inflationary potential. This implies a delicate balancing act for the monetary authorities, in which tightening must be slow enough to avoid destabilising financial markets, but fast enough not to destabilise inflationary expectations.""*

For more issues with QE and monetary policy, check out his 2012 paper:

[Ultra Easy Monetary Policy and the Law of Unintended Consequences](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)

**So what's the solution?**

The truth is that we have backed ourselves into a corner.  We are between a rock and a hard place.  The solution, it seems, was to have never gotten here in the first place.  But now that we're here, I would argue, as would Mr. White, that we ought to have a serious conversation about what we've been doing for the last 20-30 years.  Given that complex adaptive systems are prone to breakdown, we ought to do our best to be prepared for that breakdown.  But that's not what we've done.  Instead of deleveraging after 2008, we've actually become more leveraged.  Government and corporate debt are through the roof.  Vulnerabilities have not decreased, they have increased, and greatly so.

**How has our economic system broken down in the last 2 years?**

\-Coronavirus

\-Enormous and unprecedented liquidity (on top of already enormous and unprecedented liquidity post-2008)

\-Inflation that proved to be persistent rather than transitory (another failure of the Fed and central banks to forecast complexity)

\-Russian invasion of Ukraine

\-Issues in bond and currency markets (pound, yen, euro, Bank of England buying gilts)

It seems that the Fed and central banks were always making their forecasts under the assumption that everything was simple and going to go according to plan.  But we have seen, obviously, that this has not been the case.  But this should have been expected!  This is the nature of complex adaptive systems, and to be a bit philosophical, it's the nature of life itself: uncertainty.  The fact that the Fed missed it in their forecasts is because their framework is flawed.  It's the same reason they missed 2008.

**Where are the vulnerabilities now?**

Me personally I've been worried about a strong dollar and what that means for sovereigns and businesses who have to pay their debt obligations in dollars. Mr. White mentions this as a potential issue in his video (remember, from back in 2018).  We saw some real weakness in the UK today.  Here's a good article I found.  It's a tabloid but it does a nice job of summing up what happened:

[https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19943278/bank-england-drastic-step-stabilise-economy/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19943278/bank-england-drastic-step-stabilise-economy/)

I don't think this is necessarily the tipping point, but it's a serious sign of instability.  There is likely much more that we don't know about yet.

**What's going to happen?**

I don't know.  Is there a possibility that we make it out OK?  Yes, absolutely!  But it's also true that we've gradually built up a lot of vulnerabilities in the system, and the longer we keep going down this path, the more precarious the situation becomes.  Herbert Stein said that ""if something cannot go on forever, it will stop"".  A colleague quipped back: ""but it will go on much longer than you expected!""

So I can't tell you when the whole system is going to come undone, but what I can tell you is that we're on a very dangerous path.  It can't go on forever.  And I am very worried about the way things are looking right now.

**What should we do as investors?**

I'm not an expert investor, I'm a new investor who studied economics and continues to study it in his free time as a hobby.  That said, I don't think anyone should panic sell.  If you're going to sell, please do so after doing your own research, not after reading this silly Reddit post.  What I can recommend to everyone, and I think it's fair advice, is to be prudent.  Be honest about what's going on right now and do your best to try to understand it.  From there, make smart financial decisions that will be beneficial for you and your family regardless of what happens.

**My addition to Mr. White's work**

Honestly, I think everything you need to know is all there.  I have little to add.  The only thing I would like to say is I agree with him on humility.  I had a rough time growing up and that led me into addiction and alcoholism.  It was humility, and recognizing that I had a lot less power than I thought I had, that finally got me out.  I'll have been sober for 9 years this Saturday.  Humility was tough for me, but at the end of the day I found it to be more fulfilling (and more honest) than the alternative.  I think as humans we all struggle with this, and that's probably the reason why it's so hard for us to accept complexity.  It's scary to admit that we don't know.

**Where I got it right from my last post**

Well, things certainly look to be cracking.  Markets are way down.  Vulnerabilities are emerging.

**Where I got it wrong**

My thesis wasn't fully developed, and I think I put too much emphasis on ""I don't know what's going to happen"".  That remains true, humility is a huge part of this, but I think more emphasis should have been placed on the topic of complex adaptive systems.  When you view the economy in that light, the underlying vulnerabilities start to make a lot more sense.

Secondly, I obviously don't know how all this is going to play out going forward.  Today could have been the start of the next leg up.  I don't know.  The crisis hasn't fully materialized yet, but I still feel quite confident that we have been on a dangerous path.

Finally, my actionable investment advice came off as green and I should have stuck to generalities rather than specifics. 

**How this relates to** r/stocks

This is not necessarily direct investment advice, but I do think it's relevant to this community.  Understanding macro is very important in order to be a good investor.  I heard Mohamed El-Erian say today that ""you can't have a great house in a bad neighborhood"".  So no matter how great you are at investing, macro will affect you.

I have made a lot of money (for 2022 I have made about 200k so far with no OT). I have paid for my wedding completely, got a new car (modest 30k), and on top of all of that I also saved about 115k combined with what I had before traveling. I am super grateful for this life changing opportunity however there are a some downsides. I have to drive about an hour and a half each way three days a week, the places I go to absolutely suck so bad and I am completely miserable. It’s exhausting but doable for now for the money.

I was planning on continuing to do this until the money dies down and then going full time at a local hospital (would probably get around 45/hr).

Recently I fell into a full time offer with the federal government making around 100k base salary and it comes with amazing benefits and a pension. On top of that a LOT less stress, close to home and for sure a better work/life balance. It also gets great raises every year and if I get my masters I get even more money.

I’m conflicted for a couple different reasons. This government position probably won’t be there when I want it when I’m ready to stop traveling and it for sure makes more than what I will make when I do stop, plus the federal benefits and pension. However I feel like I will have fomo missing out on the crazy money I am making now (that could stop literally at any time, for example I took a $40/hr pay cut in July than what I was getting all year). 

Would the government position with the higher pay (not compared to traveling), federal benefits and pension be worth it over the short term gains of traveling? I understand this is all opinions and at the end of the day its “my call”. I appreciate any advice!",finance,1664418731
economy,Who is the next after Hungary,"European Parliament declared Hungary as no longer a democracy, and alleged Hungary is becoming a “hybrid regime of electoral autocracy.” This is a reflection of emerging intense conflict between Germany and other small countries in the EU.

We have to explain why white left is so popular in Europe first. It seems like the Europe official is advocating, such as LGBT. EU is united by different national states. If the right-wing thoughts are the general accepted universal values, we will see nationalism dominates the Europe. Then people in their countries would more focus on striving for regional benefits. It is inevitable Europe may go into fragment. EU has unified currency issue authority, but each country keeps independent fiscal policy. Facing to the economic difficulties, more and more countries find they lack independent monetary policy to deal with. At the same time, the fiscal policy is restricted because there always is a top line for fiscal deficit. More and more people become pro nationalism to ask for regional interests. It may make a divided Europe. The best way to weaken the impact is to disseminate white left thoughts. The left-wing general topics are regarding to individuals or some types of groups not based on regions, and absolutely irrelevant to regional affairs. 

Germany is the major beneficiary of the united EU. Without customs barrier, Germany boosts its “export” in the EU, and enhance its industrial advantages over other EU countries. These countries lost their markets to Germany, at the same time they have to work for Germany. Their manufacture economy is depending on Germany since they have to become the suppliers to Germany. For a long time, America is making balance between Germany and the small EU countries. A more united EU will put stress on America’s influence power to the world. However, in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, America needs Germany to lead the EU to hold on. As a reward, America has to make a concession to Germany’s wish of a more united EU. The loosening will enable Germany to implement more measures to control the Europe countries which are the potential to ask for more independence from EU.

We can see Germany get more key EU official positions now. In the foreseeable future, Germany will make more aggressive measures to unite the Europe. The countries trying to resist will be oppressed. The eastern Europe in general is dissatisfied about the current internal interests allocation in the EU. Hungary is the first one to be sanctioned. I think the next is Poland. Right now, extreme right-wing parties won the votes in Italy and Sweden. Germany will face a more difficult situation, although America has loosened the control to enable EU keep fighting, especially in the term of economy to bear high commodity price. If Le Pen wins in the France, and leads France from pro EU to anti EU, the EU needs to reform its institution of interest allocation. The united EU process is not clear, and making people focused on extreme left would not solve the fundamental problems.",finance,1664419198
investing,What makes foreign investment rates risky?,"Sorry if question is novice.

Given the low average return on US investments ( both fixed and variable), what makes foreign rates undesirable? In other words, why wouldn't investors rush to invest in the higher rates abroad? ( Often even higher rates can be found in fixed investments abroad)

Is this just due to the country risk? Foreign inflation risk? Currency exchange risk?  
If this is the case , then more questions arise:

1. US investors could theoretically ignore currency exchange risk with countries like Ecuador which use the dollar yet have their own, much higher interest rates.
2. A forward contract could protect against currency exchange risk whilst allowing for the foreign investment to take place.",finance,1664419258

USDJPY is a major carry pair. While retail is picking and squabbling over if it's going to go up 10 pips today, or 20 pips tommorow... Hedge funds have bought in over 3000 pips earlier. Moved their shit to break even and are sitting there collecting swaps since March this year.

The interest rate differential is absolutely fucked. The US is over 3%, and Japan is stuck at negative and the stubborn Japanese simply will not raise apparently. They don't give a fuck. They will intervene and sell down their USD reserves before increasing rates apparently... And there's no nice way to fix this. 

Given this we know unless USDJPY starts penetrating -1000 pips or so... Those hedge funds probably are not going to unwind their carry trades, infact they will probably buy more.


Later today we will have big US data. We will have GDP, we will have initial jobless.

The secret is this: No matter what the fuck happens. USD will go up relative to JPY.


How to trade it:

Very simple..
When the data is released let the market have it's 1 minute tantrum and then buy USDJPY at any price below the current price. No matter HOW bad the US data is.

The worse the US data the more it will bounce back up as people catch the cheap carry trade memebrships.

The way this has to go is the US either KEEPS increasing rates for YEARS to come... Or they don't and the 3% rate differential sticks. Either way there is no reason to unwind carry trades at this point.

TLDR:

Wait for retards and Bots to react to bad news later today...

I'm not saying invest in Bangladesh, but if Europe sinks you should be diving at the dip, not running away from it, because the % gain in their recovery will be greater. Obviously if you're 50+ years old and are scared of a little volatility don't bother. 

This sub seems to miss the mark so much with rallies and dips:

""This is the new norm, interest rates won't be raised much or it'll crash the economy"" - just before Dec 2021 crash.

""Oil is dead, no one is buying it and renewables are only getting more advanced"" - Aug-Sep 2020, oil steadily rises for a year after that.

Now the rest of the world is dead? That's a buy signal. 

Not talking about S&amp;P500 vs Europe, S&amp;Ps record is good and safe and most of my holdings currently are American companies. But my focus will be on international stocks for the next while.

My portfolio changes frequently but in the last year or 2 I've had:
Ferrexp0 (sold for 60% gain)

ASML (holding, even) 
Freyr battery (60% gain, holding) 
Evr@z (Russian iron mine, assets froze so forced to hold, but no losses this year because of that lol)
SBSW (South African PGM mine, down 50% because miners went on strike, intend to buy more because their cash flow is insane) 

On my radar is AMAT and C, and will open a position in mining with RIO or BHP, but not sure which.",finance,1664455064

personalfinance,"Is this budget realistic? Also, is Ebenezer Scrooge *really* a bad example?","My spouse and I grew up with very distinct financial backgrounds. My view of money may not be healthy, and I’d like to get feedback on if the budget that we (mostly I) set is realistic.

**Family Background:**

My spouse didn’t come from a home with great financial managements. Her parents declared bankruptcy when my wife was young and often used payday loans for Christmas or to make ends meet. We don’t believe they’re preparing for retirement, but it’s not discussed.

My family was stable financially. My parents had been lucky early in their marriage and paid off their home mortgage in &lt;5 years while working for a company that bubbled (and popped) in the 1990s. I estimate my parents earned about 40% more than the federal poverty line since my siblings and I would periodically lose (or regain) free school lunch. The budget was fairly tight, everything we bought was thrifted or from department store clearance aisles, but we never went without. To my knowledge, my parents never had debt after paying off their house. 

**Our Experience Budgeting:**

I’ve always been extremely tight fisted. When reading Charles Dickens’ *Christmas Carol,* I highlighted, “You fear the world too much. All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of \[poverty’s\] sordid reproach.” Because it sounded like a solid financial goal. I didn’t realize it signified an **unhealthy** obsession. For me, that’s meant a tight budget and *always* putting a little away. 

I don’t believe my wife ever created a budget before college. She afforded college, but often had very little money for food. “Running out” was a effective way to budget as she did not have a credit card. We married our senior year of college.

**Current Budget and Shortfall:**

Knowing that we have different backgrounds (and that my view of money may not be healthy) I’d love input on our budget. My spouse is a SAHM and does most of the shopping. However, we’re often over budget by several hundred dollars. I make up the short by not adding to our emergency fund (or in extreme cases) taking from it. We pulled $1000- from it each of the last three months and I’m getting concerned. Prior to 2021, our monthly income was 35% lower than it is now, and I’m afraid of hedonic adaptation.

**Tl;dr: is this budget realistic for a family of four? (Our kids are 7 &amp; 4.)**

personalfinance,Advice on planning for refinance of Physicians 10 yearARM,"We have a physician's mortgage, which is a tricky product and not offered by many lenders. Our broker at the time sold us on taking a 10 year ARM at 3.75% instead of 30yr fixed at a slightly higher rate. Said refinancing in 10 years will be no problem and ""who knows, the adjustable rate will probably be even lower!"" Whoops. 

During the crazy low interest period I could not get a call back on refinancing, and was worried about our options anyway as our CC utilziation was high. 

We have 5 years left on the ARM. Our CC utilization is still high but I am not worried about getting that under control in the next 2-3 years. It's the only real ding on our FICO score, and it should be strong after those are paid off. I'm not sure what to ask, just general advice I suppose for how to go about ensuring the best outcome on refinancing that ARM to a fixed. I'm worried in a few years things are going to be way worse, not better, interest rates will be horrible, and the fact that it's a physicians mortgage niche product complicates getting sound advice/help. Any thoughts are appreciated on what to do other than focus on slamming CC balances to pay them off ASAP.

personalfinance,Is the Extended Warranty on my Car Lease Buy Back worth it in my personal situation?,"I am buying back my car after the lease. The price of the buy-back was determined 4 years ago at the start of the lease and is significantly lower than the current market value.

**Buy Back: $19,240.32**

**Inspection Fee: $199.00** \- Why is there an inspection fee for a car I am buying back? I am not giving it back to them I am keeping it. Think I can get them to waive it?

**Transaction Fee: $495.00** \- five hundred dollars for a transaction fee?? Think it can be waived/negotiated?

**Extended Warranty: $3,199.00** :

Warranty covers 3-years or 160,000KM ***whichever happens first***.

I now work from home (since COVID) and have driven 33,000KM over almost 4-years. It is nearly guaranteed that I will surpass the 3-years of the warranty before I ever hit 160,000 KM. Considering this fact that I do not drive often and the car will have relatively low mileage for the next three years, do you think it is worth paying the extended warranty?

**Sales taxes: $3,450** \- Don't think I can do anything about this one.

**APR**: the interest rate on a finance deal is 7.99%. Is this negotiable at all?

Is the extended warranty necessary to take or not based on my driving history and expectations for the next three years (working from home, driving about 12,000 KM a year). **I will be at about 70,000KM at the end of a warranty that covers 160,000KM.**

CryptoCurrency,The World Is About To Have A Global Currency Crisis Since No One Wants To Face The Music,"As everyone has seen in the news recently with the UK and the British pound plummeting causing a near “Lehman Brothers Moment” where the BoE had to step in and inject billions into the bond market through QE to stabilize it and prevent a meltdown. The statement saying something along the lines of “We will pivot our current QT plan until the bond market is stable in our eyes.” 

9.9% reported inflation in the UK with the plan to raise rates while also pumping more money into the market until its “stable.” This shows that most nations/central banks when challenged with the tough decision will be unable to face the music that the world economy is overvalued because they’d rather continuing push the nations towards hyperinflation instead of accepting their mistakes and go into a recession. 

The recession would be very painful but isn’t hyperinflation which is far worse. All world currency’s are fleeing into USD as it’s the safest/slowest sinking ship against inflation which is further fueling the immediate pain for any nation that isn’t the US. 

The FED is still giving the hawkish behavior as the labor market /unemployment numbers are telling the FED to continue to raise rates and bring more pain to stop inflation. During any period in history where inflation was high, the only way to officially stop it was to run interest rates up to be on par or  over the actual inflation number to begin the cooling process. Most nations including the US have debts that become impossible to sustain should interest rates go too high. 

This is where the “crypto” portion comes into the picture. Most/all crypto is currently viewed as risk-on assets which is accurate for most. As this situation continues I see the more realistic possibility that peoples trust in central banks deteriorate to the extent where they seek the alternative which crypto (mainly BTC) could offer to give investors more comfort/clarity on a consistent monetary policy versus the uncertain/emotional responses. 

BTC could very well win big on the logical route most nations take which is higher inflation for longer periods of time. 

Hyperinflation/Long lasting high inflation  likely equals short term and long term gains for BTC as all asset prices inflate/the investor mindset for BTC shifts to a store of value/reliable monetary policy that people claim it is.",cryptocurrency,1664469935

CryptoCurrency,"We could potentially enter the phase of the bear market where we hit bear exhaustion, due to our higher volatility. And it won't matter what the stock market does, or if there's a tsunami. The crypto market will follow the path of least resistance. And that could be up.","The  crypto market follows the same market dynamics as any other market, but  in a much more volatile and exaggerated way. Along with still being  very much in its own world of 4 year cycles.

The  fact that it's still very much rooted in those cycles, means that  sooner or later, the long term forces of the market will outweigh any  short term volatility. Regardless of news.

The  crypto market has shown time and again that even major news can get  ignored if this market has a bigger fish to fry, like its own market  dynamics or long term trends.

Remember  when China banned Bitcoin miners and hash rate started to drop in the  summer of 2022? The market ignored that, and continued its bull run, and  went from around $35K to over $50K.

# The case of the bear exhaustion:

In  any market, if a downtrend has gone on for months, the asset has  dropped in a dramatic way based on mostly speculation than fundamentals,  and at some point all the people who wanted to sell have sold, you  start entering into an oversold phase.

The selling pressure gets exhausted, and start balancing the buying pressure. Which gives you a crabbing market.

This is currently where we seem to be.

And  right now, it doesn't matter that Putin cranked up his rhetoric, that  Fed rates keep increasing fast, that Europe is in a crisis, that the DXY  is surging, that there's a major hurricane in Florida, that stocks are  finding new lows...

Bitcoin seems to be unwilling to find its own new low. Even if it's making it decouple from its year long bromance with stocks.

When  the market starts to realize that, when you're all the way down and the  market has run out of enough selling pressure, there's only one  direction to go.

Ultimately  it's down to the market's own supply and demand. How much price opportunity is presented. Sellers vs buyers. Buy orders vs sell orders.  Shorts vs longs.

Remember, this  market doesn't need a lot of money coming in. It's not a company that needs sales results. You can increase the market cap by $1 Billion with  just $1M coming in.

I felt more confident with the gains I saw and bought into more tech (NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, Meta,) and some risky speculative stocks.

Property 1: 1.8K per year in 10 year loan. Total loan is 129K. Just bought this recently and already regrets the investment.  

Property 2: the land is paid off, the rental house has an interest rate of 8% and is a total of 2K per month. She used to get 60K per year when I was helping her, but she’s a narcissist and I had to quit since she kept threatening my “inheritance” if I didn’t help her. Now she’s making around 2K/month after the rental management company takes their share. Construction loan total is 300K. 

Property 3: the land is probably $500-800 a month. Total loan is 50K. 

Investments : 20K in 401K. Nothing in HSA. She mainly just has a pension and a bunch of land. 

She’s a huge spender on home improvement/investments, so the total cost of maintenance is around 20K a year. 

She wants to continue working to get a loan for another piece of property or wants to drag me in it, so I’m just trying to help her to make a decision and cut her off if she keeps trying to pressure me to buy property for her. My salary isn’t near hers at all.",finance,1664475767
gaming,Mixed Feelings on PlayStation PC,"Im a little miffed. I've been mostly PC gaming for the last 8 years. About 9 months ago I cracked and went on a war path to get a PS5 to finally get all the PS exclusives I've missed out on. Also bought a 4k tv pretty much for gaming. 

Now I turn around and they are coming out on PC one after the other. I'd argue my PC is still more powerful. But I only have a 1440p Monitor for it.

stocks,CarMax’s Huge Earnings Miss Sends Warning Signal on US Consumer - Another Troubling Data Point to Weakening Consumer Sentiment,"* Auto dealers Carvana, Sonic Automotive plunge in broad selloff
* Rising rates, low confidence makes consumers wary of spending

**CarMax’s fiscal second-quarter numbers failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations on nearly every metric**. **The** **company said** **the ability of potential buyers to afford vehicles has become a challenge, with rising interest rates and low consumer confidence adding further wrinkles.** 

“**CarMax has reminded Wall Street that parts of the economy are already in a recession**,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. The “affordability challenges” highlighted by the company as the main reason for the big miss suggests it is “only going to get worse as Fed tightening starts to impact the economy,” Moya added. 

“When you combine these results with the story from yesterday that demand for iPhones is weak, it raises the question about the consumer as we move toward the holiday selling season,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. **“If the consumer is weak, you can take a soft landing off the table.”**      

""**The story of CarMax’s second-quarter is clear: demand destruction,”** said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. “High used car prices and rising rates are causing a buyers’ strike.”

Forex,PLN to USD next 6m-1y?,"Hey all! Not usually on this sub but wondering if anyone has any insight on this. 

I came upon a not insubstantial amount of funds in Poland (so they are in PLN). I am thinking about converting them over to USD relatively soon, but can be patient if necessary. I have noticed that with how aggressive the fed is being that the dollar can only increase in value, while PLN is mired in war/energy/inflation troubles for the foreseeable future.

My Q is this: should I hold on with the hopes that the PLN might improve in relation to the dollar or convert immediately before it can get any worse? 

Any help is appreciated. If this isn’t appropriate for the sub, totally understand and let me know where I could go for this. Thanks!",finance,1664476477
investing,Why I DONT believe the housing market with crash.,"Why&gt; For one you would have to be desperate to sell you home in this market. Because the home owner would have to replace the asset with another, its not a chuck of gold its where you live. Everyone has to live somewhere and if people sell there home and cant afford another they rent , now you have more competition for rentals driving rents higher.  And selling your home is trading in a 3% mortgage with at 7% that would double your payment. And on top of that you pay 7-10% in commission and fees when selling your home. As for people who own second homes, as long as rents are high enough to cover the majority of the mortgage then landlords are not going to sell. 
   Now that being said if we see massive lay offs then were fucked and people are forced to sell. But if that starts happening the fed drops rates and everything recovers. Theoretically... 

Im not saying home prices wont come down in certain markets, but this fear mongering about an impending crash in nonsense.",finance,1664482045
personalfinance,Not sure what to do with my finances and my last remaining debt,"Not sure how I should proceed with my finances going forward. I’ve been paying off my debts ($150k total) for the last few years and am down to my last $30k. I am 39yo, single and intend to stay that way. Here’s my financial picture with questions at the end:

\&gt; Monthly Income: $10k gross / $7k net (after deductions and 4% 401k contribution with 2% employer match).

\&gt; Rent: $1500/mo

\&gt; Fixed Expenses: Utilities/Insurance/Cell/Internet/Subscriptions: $500/mo

\&gt; Student Loan (assuming $10k forgiveness, $30k balance remains @ 6.5%): $500/mo

That leaves me $4,500/mo for everything else in life and I end up saving around $3k a month.

I currently have….

$30k in savings earning 2.15%

$3k in checking (I always keep around $3k in checking)

$7k in my employer's 401(k) plan

$25k paid for car

&amp;#x200B;

For 39, I feel pretty pathetic with where I am at with my finances compared to friends and others around my age but am happy to be nearly and finally debt free.

\&gt;&gt; Is it foolish to keep $30k in savings when I could pay off my student loan and be debt free? With the interest rate spread it’s costing me about $100/mo to keep servicing the debt. I’m scared to only have $3k to my name, even though I can save up a decent amount more rather quickly. Job is seemingly secure, but you never know.

\&gt;&gt; I am 50/50 on buying a house in the next 12 months depending on the market. Keeping that $30k in savings would allow me to jump on something if an opportunity comes up and have a decent buffer. I’d plan on doing 5% down. Credit scores range from 810-830.

\&gt;&gt; I would also like to jump into other investments. Index funds? Bonds? Should I max out my existing 401k up to my employer match of 3% and beyond? I know I am very behind on retirement savings and I want to continue to do something with my monthly savings rather than a put it in a HYS account.

Thanks in advance for any feedback or suggestions in general.",finance,1664482615
stocks,Quick take: Roadmap to the bottom,"After a false start in early 1980, when the Fed prematurely cut rates due to the slowdown, the central bank eventually got it right when it continued hiking aggressively through the 1981-82 recession, with rates peaking at 20%.

The real-yield curve (rates minus CPI) began to flatten (flat yield curve: short term rates = long term rates) hard in 1980 as short-term real yields started to rise faster than long-term ones, and inverted (means long term rates lower than short term rates) in April 1981. **Still, buying at that point would have been on the early side, before the multi-year rally started in August 1982.**

**This inversion has not happened yet**

 **Therefore a final condition is needed for the end of the bear market**. Liquidity is one of most important medium-term drivers of equities. Its growth was still negative when the real-yield curve inverted in 1981, but by early 1982, it was positive and rising.  

Buying the S&amp;P in February 1982 after liquidity started growing would have faced about 10%-12% downside in the shorter term, before the position enjoyed an almost uninterrupted +220% rally.

**With fiscal credibility in abeyance, the real-yield curve steep and still rising, and liquidity conditions very negative, none of the conditions are currently in place.** Until they are it is difficult to have much confidence this bear market hasn’t got further to run.",finance,1664483794

cardano,Help With Finding Sources for Academic Paper,"Hello Cardano Community. 

I am currently writing an academic paper in which I use Cardano as a case study for why a for-profit business model should ***not*** render a cryptocurrency a security under US law. I am looking for a particular source/quote, in which Charles Hoskinson states (paraphrasing) that the reason he felt a for-profit structure was so important (either for ETH Foundation or IOG) was because he doubted the feasibility of developing a properly decentralized/secure/efficient blockchain under a non-profit model. Specifically, I am looking for a source to confirm that, in addition to superior code, the for-profit preference was to avoid network capture like that in ETH, either by entities like Infura or Consensys, or from validators (2/3 done by 7 entities). The idea being that for-profit applications will inevitably drive development in crypto, and if IOG or ETH foundation didn't fill that role early on, it would be captured by others who are short-sighted and dont have the best long-term goals of the network in mind. He said Cardano's competitors are Google and Amazon, not BTC and ETH, and they have near infinite resources and unilateral control. That is why Cardano began as a federated model, slowly releasing control to the public. 

I know I have heard him say things along these lines before, but obviously if I am going to include it in the paper it must have a citation. If anyone can point me to where I can find such a quote, whether from him or another high ranking member of Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, or IOG, please let me know. 

Thank you for your help!",cryptocurrency,1664493025

personalfinance,Real estate investing advice,"Hi all,

I’d like to ask for real estate advice. (Maybe this is better suited for the /Realestateinvesting community, but I think this community is my best choice).

I(24m) moved to the US a few years ago and would like to dabble into real estate, which involves both buying a property for personal use and an investment property.

I am self-employed and work remotely. Last year, I made $165K, and this year, about $210K. I have several sources of income and job is very recession and risk-proof.

About 30% of my income (29% last year, 29% this year as I moved to a tax-free state) goes to taxes, 30% is spent, and 40% is saved. This year, the savings percentage obviously increased as I am making more. 

Given the current market downturn, I have roughly $100K saved (stocks, some cash). 

Next spring/early summer, I would like to buy a personal residence. 

But, I am traveling 3-4 months a year for personal and work reasons, so I thought it would be nice to AirBnB a room, or the entire apartment when I am gone. After some thought, I decided to buy a 2 or 3-bedroom and rent out one bedroom on AirBnB, this way I have flexibility and am not stuck with a long-term roommate.

However, I don’t think I can rent out the entire place, because I am not comfortable leaving the personal belongings, documents, etc, and leaving for a long time, letting guests in.

I would also like a low-tax state with pleasant weather all-year round. 

I understand the current housing market conditions are difficult, with high interest rates and prices still not down. 

So, here are a few different plans I came up with.

Step 1: buy an expensive property (~700K) in a cold state, such as New Hampshire, or by Lake Tahoe on NV side. Use it as a primary residence for a year. Monthly expenses would be ~$4000-4500 a month, rent out a bedroom 8-9 months a year, when I am there, or AirBnB. With a 60-70% occupancy rate, that would cover most expenses.

Step 2: in a year, buy a new cheap primary residence in a hot state (Dallas, TX), for about $150-200K. A small 1bd  condo. There are many of those.

Live in the Texas place all winter, come to Tahoe or New Hampshire for the summer, use the cold state property as AirBnB 9 months a year (manage remotely with team in place).

I am able to get financing for both properties, and fairly comfortably pay both. If this succeeds, I get a perfect lifestyle climate-wise, and would pay very little if anything out of pocket.

I am fairly familiar with AirBnB on the guest side, having used it last 6-7 years worldwide. The main concern is regulations, such as the areas I’m looking to buy cracking on STR. If that happens, I could maybe lease them on a monthly basis.


Alternative plan:

1)Househack a 3-4 plex. This seems easier on paper, but I am not finding any deals that cash flow, or even break even. Anywhere. 

Another plan: 

1)buy a cheap (150-250K) primary residence. 
2)start buying AirBnB in my home country in Eastern Europe. I have people to manage them, the deals seem better. High-end Properties are $100-150K, but I can only pay cash. The banking system is a failure, there is no financing. 

Another plan;
1)Buy a cheap primary residence;
2)Start buying up SFH or MF in a cheap state (like MO where I lived at some point, and where I am very familiar with the market, neighborhoods, etc). 

I also am aware that states like New Hampshire and Texas have a higher property tax. Now I save $10-11K a year on income tax, so I am also considering moving to a place like Colorado, where I would save this much in property tax compare to those two, once I hold $1M of real estate or more.

I would appreciate all advice you guys have!",finance,1664497263

gaming,Dream versions of games and my idea for an ATLAB rpg,"I've thought about this for years!!! I've had a few idea for games and i would be cool to hear what some of your ideas are as well. I seriously doubt any gaming studios would do any of these. But if an idea sparks your interest and you use it. Please just send me a PS5 and a percentage lol! 

Let me start off with saying im a casual gamer, so I might refer to other types of games to help paint the picture.

&amp;#x200B;

(Yes I know there is that new one by WB. Let me live. lol)The people behind smash bros makes a Marvel vs DC fight game. How fun would it be to have the fantastic fight mechanics, fun little stages and smash ball type finishers. My opening roster for Marvel: Capt. America, Iron man/ war machine, Spider man, Gambit, Blade, Iron fist, Black Widow, Black Panther, Storm, Dr. Doom and Magneto. For DC: The Big 3(Sups, Bats and Wonder Woman), Damien Wayne Robin, Black Canary, Black Cat, Martian Manhunter, Cat Woman, Shazam/Black Adam, Static Shock, Mr. Freeze and Sinestro.

Possible DLC/Unlockables:  Darkseid, Apocalypse, Black Manta, Black Bolt, Green Lantern(different skins are different lanterns) Dark Phoenix, Bane, Lady Shiva, Jonah hex, Constantine, Mystique, Rouge, Night Crawler, Wong, Dora Milaje(like Pyra and Mythra)

&amp;#x200B;

A better version of Jump force. Maybe by the studios who make Tekken or even the studio that made budokai  Include newer animes like Justsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer, fire force, God of high school.

&amp;#x200B;

My last one is my idea for an Avatar(last airbender) RPG:

The game takes place 1000 years after Korra. A few avatars after Kora the nations started to hunt down and kill avatars, realizing that their power was to great and begin to fear them. There hasn't been one for the past 100 years. The water nation has risen to power by creating a cataclysmic event keeping the moon covering the sun. The ability to blood bend being extremally strong they have become harsh rulers. Since the moon is almost constantly blocking the sun, true fire benders have nearly died out. Those who haven't died or the rare ones born have all been made to live in isolation. Begrudgingly, the earth and air benders have sided with the water nation. Any rebellion has been snuffed out long ago. Now as one nation under the rule of the High Council of the ever lasting moon. A shady ruthless organization keeping the poor poor and the rich rich but everyone lives equally  in fear.  However the high council has heard whispers of a prophecy about a new Avatar being born. They will be savior or enslaver. This will be the strongest avatar in the past 100 years. If they are not caught or killed it could mean the ruin of high councils rule. 

The games picks up in  Eclipse City. A thriving futuristic Chinese gothic city founded on top of the now sunken great city of Ba Sing Se. This thriving city is filled with life and interactive environments. The vast city is filled with benders helping the city run. But just behind the sparking skyscrapers, in the dark alleys behind the chinese style buildings, the Eclipse city PD and Bender gangs are going to war. The lower classes are running out of resources.  

This is where we meet our main character. The new avatar, Xao. A gifted bender with a chip on their shoulder. Orphaned young and forced into servitude by the ECPD. To pay off your debt you are forced into take contracts taking out leaders of the quickly growing gangs. After taking a mission you stumble upon a huge undergrown rebellion which will change your life. 

The game will feature an advanced character creation. You can pick your element(nation). Each element will have one or two special sub bending abilities. Water: blood and healing bending. Earth: metal and lava bending. Air: Flight and spirit bending. Fire: lighting and Combustion bending. 

Which ever element you pick will decide how easy or hard traversal of the city. If you pick water you will be feared by the locals making it harder to infiltrate local slums however if you pick fire bending it will be near impossible(at first) to enter the High Council Temples. 

Once the game gets going you will encounter Raava and Vaatu. Your good and evil meters. Each decision you make, each person you help or hurt will feed them. The game would be a great blend of infamous, Black Myth: Wu Kong and assassin's creed.",technology,1664503493

**London Police arrest 17-year-old hacker suspected of Uber and GTA 6 breaches**  
The City of London Police on Friday revealed that it has arrested a 17-year-old from Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking. The department said the arrest was made as part of an investigation in partnership with the U.K. National Crime Agency's cybercrime unit. No further details about the nature of the investigation were disclosed, although it's suspected that the law enforcement action may have something to do with the recent string of high-profile hacks aimed at Uber and Rockstar Games. Both the intrusions are alleged to have been committed by the same threat actor, who goes by the name Tea Pot (aka teapotuberhacker). Uber, for its part, has pinned the breach on an attacker (or attackers) that it believes is associated with the LAPSUS$ extortion gang, two of whom are facing fraud charges. According to cybersecurity company Flashpoint, the real world identity of the hacker behind the two incidents is said to have been outed on an online illicit forum.

**Study finds organizations deluged with cybersecurity incidents**  
A new report from the security vendor Trellix found that the average SecOps team managed 51 cybersecurity incidents per day. 36% reported seeing significantly higher, dealing with 50 to 200 incidents daily. 46% agreed to being “inundated by a never-ending stream of cyber-attacks.” Siloed systems remained a common pain point, with 60% saying poorly integrated products reduced organizational efficiency in responding. This also appears to cost organizations money, with 84% saying they estimated losses from the incidents at up to 10% of annual revenue.

**Finnish intelligence warns Russia ‘highly likely’ to turn to cyber in winter**  
The head of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Suojelupoliisi or SUPO) says it is “highly likely that Russia will turn to the cyber environment over the winter” for espionage due to challenges impacting its human intelligence work. In the unclassified *National Security Overview 2022* published on Thursday, SUPO said that Russia’s traditional intelligence gathering approach using spies with diplomatic cover “has become substantially more difficult since Russia launched its war of aggression in Ukraine, as many Russian diplomats have been expelled from the West.” SUPO assessed that Russian citizens who occupied critical positions in Finland were particularly at risk of coercion from the Russian authorities.

**Attackers impersonate CircleCI platform to compromise GitHub accounts**  
GitHub is warning of an ongoing phishing campaign targeting its users to steal credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes by impersonating the CircleCI DevOps platform. The company learned of the attacks against its users on September 16, it pointed out that the phishing campaign has impacted many victim organizations except GitHub. Phishing messages claims that a user’s CircleCI session expired and attempt to trick recipients into logging in using GitHub credentials. The company pointed out that the accounts protected by hardware security keys are not vulnerable to this attack.

**Lazarus Group targets macOS users**  
We’ve seen a number of threat groups use the surging job market as a perfect vector for cyber attacks. The security researchers at SentinelOne report that the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group operates a campaign targeting macOS users. This lures users with job offers at [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/). ESET and Malwarebytes reported on the campaign originally last month, targeting Windows users with similar crypto-related jobs. It’s not clear how the campaign specifically delivers the initial malware payload. Some reports suggest private messaging on LinkedIn. These likely represent short-term campaigns focused on theft, given the threat actors do not obfuscate any binaries in the attacks.

**Geopolitics behind recent DDoS surge**  
It seems like in 2022, we’ve talked about another record breaking DDoS attack every couple of weeks. A new report from NETSCOUT found that these likely come from a rise in wars and regional disputes in the year. The company tracked over six million DDoS incidents, finding they used 57% more bandwidth than last year. The overall number of DDoS attacks remained consistent, the extra bandwidth reflects more intensity. Countries with ties to the war in Ukraine saw the most impact. Finland saw a 258% increas in DDoS attacks since applying for NATO membership. Ireland, India, Taiwan, Belize, Romania, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, and Latvia also saw notable increases.

**Leaked ransomware builder used in attacks**  
Last week, a LockBit 3.0 builder leaked on Twitter. This came as the result of a seeming fallout between the ransomware operator and the developer. The leak opened the door for anyone to build a functional encryptor and decryptor for attacks. Bleeping Computer confirmed that a new ransomware group called  'Bl00Dy Ransomware Gang' did just that against a Ukrainian victim. Their previous work largely used Conti ransomware, targeting a group of medical practices in New York. The group did some light modifications to LockBit 3.0, but functionally it remains identical.

**Cloudflare hopes Turnstile can replace CAPTCHAs**  
CAPTCHAs feature inherent shortcomings, offering slow, cryptic, and arguably effective human verification. To avoid these, Cloudflare released a beta for Turnstile which it calls “a user-friendly, privacy preserving alternative” to CAPTCHA. Rather than visual puzzles, Turnstile uses JavaScript-based rotating browser challenges that read the browser environment for indicators of human behavior. These challenges get more sophisticated the more indicators of non-human behavior it detects. Turnstyle uses browser information, not human interaction. Cloudflare says this can reduce the verification process to one second.

**Fast Company goes dark after cyber attack**  
Late on September 27th, Apple News sent notifications from the publication Fast Company that contained racist and obscene language. Apple subsequently suspended its channel on the app. Fast Company confirmed a threat actor breached its Apple News account, saying it suspended its feed and shut down [FastCompany.com](http://fastcompany.com/) while it investigates. This came after the attacker appeared to post  a message on the site before the take down, claiming to have access to a commonly shared password with admin access. The post also pointed to a dark web forum that claims it will release thousands of employee records and draft posts from the publication. The attacker said it didn’t obtain customer information as the site stored that information on a separate server.

**Researchers uncover covert attack campaign targeting military contractors**  
A new covert attack campaign singled out multiple military and weapons contractor companies with spear-phishing emails to trigger a multi-stage infection process designed to deploy an unknown payload on compromised machines. The highly-targeted intrusions, dubbed STEEP#MAVERICK by Securonix, also targeted a strategic supplier to the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft. Starting in late summer 2022 the infection chains begin with a phishing mail with a ZIP archive attachment containing a shortcut file that claims to be a PDF document about ""Company &amp; Benefits,"" which is then used to retrieve a stager -- an initial binary that's used to download the desired malware -- from a remote server.

**IRS warns of ""industrial scale"" smishing surge**  
In a news alert yesterday, the tax agency said it had identified thousands of fake domains so far in 2022, used to facilitate the so-called “smishing” scams, and designed to steal victims’ personal and financial information. Spoofed to appear as if sent from the IRS, these text messages often use lures like fake COVID relief, tax credits or help setting up an IRS online account, it said. They might request personal information or covertly download malware to the user’s device by tricking them into clicking on a malicious link. “This is phishing on an industrial scale so thousands of people can be at risk of receiving these scam messages,” said IRS commissioner Chuck Rettig.

personalfinance,Is your 401k down? So is everyone else’s.,"Like every other question lately has been along the lines of asking what people ought to do with their negative return retirement accounts. Here are the basics in case it helps.

## Basics

* 401k plans (and IRAs and any other investment vehicle) are not cash accounts. The money you contribute purchases assets like equities/stocks and bonds.
* These assets change in value. Apple stock was once worth $22/share. It’s now closer to $145/share. In Dec 2021 the price was $180/share. In other words, values go up AND down.
* This change in prices does NOT matter to you so long as you’re a long way from retirement. Why? Because over the long term prices mostly go up.
* If you ARE closer to retirement you do indeed need to look at allocation (split between stocks/equities and bonds or more stable assets) to keep your portfolio stable. The cost of stability is slow growth.

## Why are prices dropping so much right now?

* Inflation is very high. In the long term inflation is very dangerous. It eats away at everyone’s standard of living. So the Federal Reserve is VERY focused on taming inflation.
* The way they try to get this done is by raising interests rates on money lent to banks. That is, it’s more expensive for banks to borrow money. In turn, banks charge you and I and companies a higher interest rate to borrow from them. Fewer people borrow. Economic activity slows. Demand for goods and services slows. And prices come down. This is the theory.
* If the Fed overshoots (raises rates too quickly or too much) we get a slow economy that could tip into a recession. If the Fed undershoots (doesn’t raise rates enough or quickly enough) the economy stays hot and inflation can continue to rise.
* So, companies and people are basically skeptical of the idea that the Fed can thread the needle and give us a “soft landing”, where inflation is lowered but the economy stays warm. This negative outlook (along with geo-political turmoil and supply chain issues) is why stock prices are down. Turns out, the stock market is very sensitive to how people are feeling.

## What should you do?

* Assuming you have a stable job, a solid emergency fund, and are a long way from retirement you should do nothing. That is, you should not change your plans at all. If you had a set % contribution from each paycheck going into your 401k, keep it.
* If you can afford to, increasing contributions means you’ll be buying assets while they’re cheap. [u/LoganSquire made a point below about this.](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xs3mr1/is_your_401k_down_so_is_everyone_elses/iqj4345/)

## What should you NOT do?

* You should NOT stop contributing if you can afford to keep contributing.
* You should NOT be cashing out. There are fees and penalties associated with this action if you’re talking about a retirement/tax advantaged account. But many people still think they should cash out and buy back in at lower prices. This is called timing the market and you cannot do it. Traders on Wall Street get paid millions to try to do this as their full time job and even they lose tons of money all the time. The last time people wanted to cash out en mass was in March 2020 when people panicking about COVID said the market was gonna crash. Then prices soared to new highs and people were left with no choice but to buy back in at very high prices. NO ONE HAS A CRYSTAL BALL.
* You should NOT be checking your balance daily. Just leave it alone. Save yourself the stress. In fact, looking at balances is a little deceptive. That’s not cash in the account, remember. It’s cumulative value of the assets you own. So you haven’t lost anything unless you decide to sell those assets at prices lower than what you paid original.

That’s the gist of it.

EDIT: A few comments mentioned that people might continue to contribute but change their allocation to something ""safer"", which might slow the bleeding until markets pick back up. There is hidden danger in this.

Take this example. Stock prices go from $10 -&gt; $3 -&gt; $11 per share over a 12 month period. During that same period a safer more conservative asset remains at a steady $7 per share.

Scenario 1: keep contributing $100/month into all stocks.

Scenario 2: $100/mo split between stocks and the conservative asset. Stocks when stock price is above $7. Conservative asset when stock price is at or below $7.

Although the losses are less for the second scenario for a time, the gains are greater in the end for scenario 1.

[SC of spreadsheet with detail.](https://imgur.com/a/TEUjadL)

Note, this isn't advice, just an illustration of what it means to continue to ""buy on the way down."" Your allocation should reflect your timeline and risk appetite.

**Question: Do I sell my home in Maryland now or rent it out?** 

**About Our Situation:** 

My fiancée (28F) and I (34M) moved from Maryland to Salt Lake City Utah for a new job at the beginning of September. The job pays fairly well and she works full time remote, between the two of us we earn about 270k/yr. I originally planned on selling my townhome in Maryland and buying a house here in Utah but that was prior to interest rates skyrocketing so now I’m wondering if I should rethink my strategy. Homes here in Utah are very expensive and have nearly doubled in value since the start of the pandemic. We’re seeing a lot of price drops on the market now but even so with interest rates so high its much more expensive to buy now than when we initially decided to move here. We’d expect to spend somewhere around 700k for a home here in Utah and would be looking to buy as soon as we either sell the home back home or decide to rent it.

**Maryland Home Background:** 

The Maryland town house just completed a multi-year whole home renovation. Everything from wiring to plumbing to the kitchen and bathroom has been replaced. I got a little carried away and the renovations are far too nice for the neighborhood but since I did all the work myself the costs weren’t too bad. For example, the bathroom shower and floors are all marble. The reason I bring that up is because the material is very delicate and easily damaged if improperly cleaned or not regularly sealed by a renter. 

The house would likely sell for between 300-320k and I still owe 165k on it. Loan is a 2.5% 15 year loan. Payments are $1600/mo. If I sold the home the company I work for would pay all the closing costs and associated tax on the imputed income. 

Expected rent is somewhere between 2300-2500/mo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Details:** 

I have about 175k in stocks that I could sell. They average out to a net zero gain so I wouldn’t owe any taxes on them if I sold them. 

Our credit is good 780+ so we’d expect to a loan at the best possible rates.

stocks,"A Summary Of What Is Happening In The UK With Pension Funds, Gilts, and Bank of England","There has been a lot of market volatility this week largely driven by what's happening in the UK. It has a lot to do with pension funds, gilts, and the Bank of England. I put together an easy-to-understand summary. The entire situation is a bit more complicated and I might have missed a point or two, but I tried to keep this as high-level as possible.

* Pension funds have to pay retirees a fixed amount
* They purchase UK government bonds (gilts) because they are one of the safest investments (gov’t backed)
* The gilts’ value fluctuates based on interest rates so pension funds need to employ a strategy to hedge against those fluctuations
* Pension funds turn to Liability-driven Investment (LDI) funds to manage an LDI strategy, which uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations
* But in order to enter into and secure these contracts and swaps, you need to post an underlying asset as collateral (i.e., your contract has to be backed by some sort of asset), which in this case is gilts (and some cash)
* As part of a swap agreement, there are margin requirements, meaning the value of the underlying collateral has to meet a minimum required amount
* But gilts suddenly collapsed in value (due to selling off) when the UK chancellor and prime minister announced their tax cut strategy last week
* Why did the UK chancellor and prime minister announced tax cuts? Because they wanted to “spur economic growth”
* People became fearful for several reasons:
   * a tax cut means that the government will have to take on greater debt at a time when interest rates are rising to fund whatever projects or spending they require
   * More debt leads to fears of greater inflation
   * Greater inflation leads to potentially greater rate hikes
   * Greater rate hikes mean greater cost to borrow
   * It is a vicious loop if not managed properly
* As a result of fear and uncertainty, and low confidence in the future, people began dumping the pound and the value of the pound plunged. The UK market and markets in general sold off
* Gilts, which are supposedly one of the safest investments in the UK began to sell off and collapse in value as fear set in
* When the value of gilts collapsed, pension funds had to post additional collateral (margin call) to meet those margin requirements per the swaps contracts
* This meant that pension funds had to find cash to provide to LDI funds to meet the margin call, or slash positions in gilts in order to get hold of cash
* Most pension funds did not have the necessary cash reserves to meet those margin calls -- no one expected such a sharp drop in gilt value
* If pension funds aren’t able to pay up they get kicked out of their derivatives positions. When they are kicked out, they then have naked exposure to further sharp moves in in rates and therefore value of gilts
* This would potentially have been disastrous given that pension funds might not have been able to meet their future liabilities (payments to retirees). This is a big deal given the size of total pension fund market (in UK \~$3.59T). Imagine tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands?) of people relying on their pension fund for retirement and potentially not being able to receive their guaranteed amt. Imagine in the worst case scenario where \~$3.59T is wiped out, pension funds become insolvent, and the trickle-down implications it could have for the broader economy. This is why some compared this to an almost Lehman Brothers event
* Pension Funds asked the Bank of England (BOE) to step in and intervene
* BOE states they will temporarily buy gilts and do whatever necessary and pledge unlimited purchases to help stabilize the situation
* How would this stabilize the situation? Because purchases of gilts would prop up the value of gilts (think increase in demand to meet large supply) and reduce or eliminate margin calls for pension funds. No margin calls = pension funds can keep their derivative positions to continue hedging against interest rate volatility

Today's core PCE reading came in higher than forecast (which was also quite high).

How positive are you that US inflation will start to cool off from next month, or let's say, in the next 6 months?

Bitcoin,"Who else invests in Bitcoin not because you like it, but because there isn't anything really better?","Seriously!  Let's look at the alternatives:

Crypto not named Bitcoin (shitcoins):  Too centralized/captured, or they're a less used/ill conceived version of Bitcoin itself but worse, or they track the $ which is basically fiat.  

Shares of publicly traded companies (stocks):  The management team controls the issuance and buybacks, the prices go up when the central bank lowers rates, and down when the central bank increases rates.  What if the management teams mismanages it or commits fraud.  Also they can be taxed by government and regulated to hell and back.  

Corporate Bonds:  Same issues with management team as with stocks.  Also controllable by the central bank as they will go up when interest rates decrease and vice versa.  No guarantee they will pay higher interest than inflation, and if the corporation goes bankrupt you lose.  And if they are TBTF and go bankrupt, you still lose (see automaker bailouts of 2008).  

Government Bonds:  These are by far the most controlled investment by the government and it's central bank.  Forget it, I'm not a pension fund.  And you'll never beat inflation with these.  

Junk Bonds:  Forget it.  I'm not Michael Milken, and I've got no idea which of these are a good deal and which aren't.  Not willing to take the risk of default.  And besides, these are central bank controllable as well.  

Rental Real Estate:  This is the best productive investment right now IMO, but it's got it's problems.  Eviction moratorium.  Also, just highly overpriced right now and still pretty risky.  St. Paul, Minnesota just enacted rent control.  Orange County, Florida has put rent control on the ballot even though it's illegal in the state.  Even red states have knuckleheads pushing for rent control/stabilization.  Also, you have to deal with tenants not paying rent, maintain/repair, etc.  What if your condo gets wiped out by a Hurricane and you didn't have sufficient insurance.  

Annuities:  You'll get killed by inflation.  Forget it. 

Fiat currency:  Get lost. 

Gold/silver/other precious metals(physical):  Best non-productive asset available not named Bitcoin.  But government/banks can keep the prices suppressed using futures contracts and ETFs.  Also they aren't very fungible and it's hard to independently verify purity and authenticity.  They can be stolen/lost.  You have to pay a cap gain tax when/if you sell, even if price only went up due to inflation.  You can drop your gold bars and damage the assay card (actually happened to me).  Also, metals are mined from the ground, therefore the supply and potential supply is never limited, so a high price will bring more supply to the market.  Easily traceable by government at point of sale/purchase.  

Precious metal ETFs/Futures:  Forget it.  This is playing the government/banks' paper games.  When metals become unattainable and/or unaffordable and spike in price, they will do to you what the LME did to the Nickel market.  That is, cover the big boys at your expense.  No thanks.  

Meme stocks like GME, AMC and BBBY:  Nope.  That's playing poker.  May as well take it to the casino.  

Farmland:  Government can tax it all they want.  Government can tell you ""this is your wheat quota, you're not allowed to produce more wheat than this"", and if you try to grow the wheat to feed your livestock...well, you're affecting the wheat market (which is interstate commerce) by *not buying wheat!*  (This actually happened)  Totally captured by government.  Also, I've never been a farmer, would have to learn.  And it's hard work.  And risky to boot.  No thanks.  

Oil or nat gas futures:  You have to play the paper games to own these.  So it's got the same problem with precious metal futures in that when/if you should ever really win big, the exchange will shut you down and protect the big boys, like the LME and Nickel market.  Also, these have carrying costs of holding.  As far as non-productive assets go, these are some of the toughest to hold onto.  

So, there's probably other investments out there, but this covers most of the major ones.  It's almost kind of like, Bitcoin is the default choice.  Does anyone else here hodl not so much because they love Bitcoin, but because nothing else has any appeal?  Is anyone in the same boat?",cryptocurrency,1664564044

investing,Stocks have a Bond Problem: Historical Performance,"I will attempt to explain the title without using graphs, because it seems the Mods do not really like such; same goes from links to sources. I will provide the name of sources and references below.

All investments are relative, thus how TINA (There Is No Alternative) came about. Over the past century, the performance of the S&amp;P 500 (Stocks) versus US Investment Grade Corporate Bond Total Return Index (Bonds), aka the Stock to Bond Ratio (Ratio), has relatively defined peaks and troughs.

Generally, when the S&amp;P 500 is greater than 1x (to Bonds), we see a long period (decade plus) of under-performance vs Bonds that can come in short order:

* June 1929: Ratio crosses above 1x
* August 1929: Ratio peaks at 1.11x
* September 1929: Ratio goes below 1x
* May 1932: Ratio is 0.19x
* January 1955: Ratio crosses 0.50x for the first since since falling below said level (April 1931)
* For this entire period: Bonds +157%, Stocks +36%

&amp;#x200B;

* October 1964: Ratio crosses above 1x (1.02x)
* October 1968: Ratio peaks at 1.31x
* November 1973: Ratio drops below 1x
* From 1978 - 1994: Ratio fluctuated between 0.64x and 1.02x (briefly over 1x), with a majority of the time the ratio resting below 0.75x
* For this entire period (through 1994): Bonds +704%, Stocks +444%

&amp;#x200B;

* May 1997: Ratio crosses above 1x
* May 2000: Ratio peaks at 1.46x
* August 2001: Ratio drops below 1x
* January 2009: Ratio bottoms at 0.51x
* For this entire period: Bonds +84%, Stocks -8%

&amp;#x200B;

* August 2018: Ratio crosses above 1x but never breaks higher like prior times
* May 2020: Ratio bottoms at 0.75x (COVID)
* August 2020: Ratio crosses above 1x
* April 2022: Ratio peaks at 1.43x
* For this period: Bonds +2%, Stocks +28% (I've group this time period together given peak levels)

Current level (September 2022): 1.25x

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at the median ratio level by decade, we find the following:

* 1920s: 0.51x
* 1930s: 0.32x
* 1940s: 0.24x
* 1950s: 0.50x
* 1960s: 0.98x
* 1970s: 0.86x
* 1980s: 0.77x
* 1990s: 0.75x
* 2000s: 0.79x
* 2010s: 0.92x
* 2020s: 1.21x

Given history, it seems unreasonable to expect this level of performance in stocks relative to bonds. This is not an absolute call on stocks (bull or bear), but only relative to corporate bonds given history. Yes, the S&amp;P and the Bond Index composition has changed over these decades, however it seems fair to use this data and a just one mean of trying to identify stock values relative to other alternatives, in this case investment grade corporate credit.

Edit: formatting

Edit 2: as correctly pointed out by u/tachyonvelocity this is using the S&amp;P 500 price index and not the total return, therefore some periods mentioned above do not reflect dividends and buybacks and therefore stocks outperformed bonds (1964-1994).

But while correct, if I completed this sort of analysis I would also use a volatility-weighted, risk adjusted approach. In relative trading for me, this is the single most critical aspect. For this subreddit and for buy and hold and DCAs, it likely has no relevance. 

Hugh Hendry once gave a presentation in 2016 where he showed a chart that showed the US equities lost value to US 10y treasuries from 1971 to 2016 by 75% after adjusted for volatility… of course, as he rightfully stated and you might imagine, you’re long 10y up to you ears, but again, it puts assets on a “constant basis”. 

Ray Dalio has also tried to explain this in that a 50/50 portfolio where stocks and bonds are negatively correlated, when volatility adjusted isn’t a true 50/50 portfolio, but more 80 (stocks) / 20 portfolio.",finance,1664565945

CryptoCurrency,Crypto is dead,"There I said it.  


The culture around crypto is not what it used to be. People rejoice whenever a huge bank or a company enters the crypto space or when governments pass pro-crypto legislations .  


Alt-coins are strongly co-related to Bitcoin which is co-related to the stock market. Decision from one country's central bank about raising or decreasing interest rates causes panic or euphoria.  


Bitcoin's block-chain is under constant surveilance by... well... block-chain surveilance companies. Privacy and  anonymity are sacrificed in the name of big corporations and governments wishes. Mixers, designed to protect our privacy and anonymity are being shut down.  


Stable coins are a fucking plague and frankly the biggest ponzi scheme I've ever seen and yet their wide-spread use and unrealistic APYs raise no concerns among average users.

Crypto youtubers are all clickbaity scammers and look exactly like a cariture of a Soyjak. Channels like Bitboy crypto gain millions of views during bull markets while their content is worthless. It's just these idiots telling the people what they want to hear... and the people listen.  


Cenralized exchanges all practice fractional reserves banking but without regulations that are imposed on banks which results in the worst of both worlds in one place. Leverage trading on these exchanges causes ridiculous price actions, such as the infamous Bart Simpson formation. These exchanges are also infamous for withholding withdrawals whenever they don't have enough liquidity to pay up.

Billionaires like Elon Musk and Michael Saylor are consideres relevant in the crypto-space and cause large price fluctuations with a silly Twitter post. Remember the Dogecoin fuckery?

In the UK the interest rate is 1.39% AER but if I move money out, the rate goes to nothing. In the US the interest rate is 2.50% APY and it doesn't matter if I move stuff in, out, or do the hokey cokey.

I do not want to move the money that's in the US, but my instinct is that my UK money is probably better off being in the US in this account, as it will earn interest at a faster rate, and if I really need it it's not a huge deal to transfer the money back to the UK although I will obviously lose a little money each time. The fees look just under $8 to move USD&gt;GBP and £5 to move GBP&gt;USD.

I've tried to do the maths and failed and I don't trust that I have taken everything into consideration here so in need of some sensible advice. Don't even get me started on the currency exchange being worse... Thanks!",finance,1664568787

personalfinance,After Tax-401(k) Contributions &amp; Irrevocable Trust,"Let me start out by saying that I am fortunate to have this problem but I've looked several places on the internet and I am unable to find a clear answer. 

I am currently maxing out my 401(k). My employer offers an option to make after-tax 401(k) contributions up to the federal limit ($60k-ish). I have access to a trust and its money that I do not plan to utilize soon, if ever. I am currently married around 40 in the 24% federal tax bracket.

Question: Is there any tax benefit to pulling money out of the trust and maxing out total 401(k) (i.e., $60k-ish per year)? How would I go about calculating this?",finance,1664570154

personalfinance,Advice on budgeting while living on my own for the first time,"Hi all, I’m going to be moving out soon because my company requires us to return to office. I am 24 M and this is my first job after graduating college. I currently live with my parents but am moving to a nearby city so I don’t spend 4+ hours of my day commuting. I have about $70k left in federal student loans after focusing on making payments while I lived with my parents. I make about $61k annually after taxes/insurance/401k. I also have very little savings after focusing on paying off student debt and credit card debt.

My current monthly take home is about $5100.  My plan is to save $1k every month, and make a  $1k payment towards my student loans monthly. Once I save enough to have a 6-month emergency fund, I will then contribute $1500 to my student loans and save $500 monthly instead. My other expenses will be my car/insurance, which is about $400 monthly, and I’m aiming to keep rent around $1000-$1400. Groceries and utilities will be around $200 monthly as well. So that leaves me with about $1100 left for the month to use for other necessities and fun money. Does anyone have any thoughts or critiques of my plan? Or any advice in general? This will be my first time living on my own. Thank you for reading and any advice is appreciated.",finance,1664574056

personalfinance,"Denied 1 Auto loan from CU, worth it to try applying for others?","Today I applied for, and was rejected by my credit union in regards to an auto loan. This credit union is based in California (where I used to live), but I currently live in New Hampshire (USA). I am hoping to buy a used car for about $15k. I have a FICO credit score of 793, have enough saved up for a $4800 down payment. So, I'm seeking a loan for about $10,200. But my income is pretty low (about $1900 before taxes, $1550 per month after taxes).

&amp;#x200B;

Do people think it's worth my time to **apply for auto loans at credit unions in New Hampshire** (of which I am *not* already a member)? Or should I try finding another option? I'm wary of the auto loans offered by dealerships because of their higher interest rates (7-10% usually it looks like). **I don't know if I have high enough income to be approved by a credit union**  


I don't currently own a car. My car broke down a few months ago and I have been getting around by e-bike.",finance,1664578673
